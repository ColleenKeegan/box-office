"How the West Was Dumb << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The NFLs Numbers Game  Next Tasteless Walt Disney Studios Facebook Twitter Print Celebrities How the West Was Dumb The Lone Ranger and mega-budget dreariness by Wesley Morris on July 3 2013 The Tonto that Johnny Depp plays in The Lone Ranger is covered in hardened cracking war paint. You cant see the star for the makeup. You often cant see the makeup for the movie that contains it. And even though much of what there is to see here is handsome-looking -- the mountainside horse trots; the swinging swooping crane shots; the delicate balance of light from many sources including the dental work of Armie Hammer -- you hate to behold it. For it is awful and profligate brainless and eternal loud and cruel a movie but not. No 149-minute Western should feature more close-ups of timepieces than of horses or human beings. It should not spend a reported 250 million to feature a plot in which a railroad tycoon looks to bilk magnates of their millions. It should not see the fraught historical relationship between Native Americans and white people as the perfect occasion to test a new theme-park ride. But its summer. Theres money to spend and Johnny Depp to spend it on. You hate to watch a movie like The Lone Ranger if it makes a movie like World War Z seem profound and it does. You hate to watch a movie like this because its makers assume that the ideal audience enjoys being treated as if it were a packing peanut. You hate to think that all anyone involved with this movie thought was Pirates Pirates Pirates and there you are thinking exactly that. Gore Verbinski directed the film for which three men received writing credit -- Justin Haythe and Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio a pair who wrote the first Shrek and Pirates movies. As much as youd like to say that the story of an uptight masked lawman who teams up with a delusional Comanche in the name of justice is a fine seed from which to sow a visual-effects blockbuster you also know this might be a lie. Youre given a plot in which iconic characters created in the 1930s return seemingly because someone thought itd be fun to stage a long climactic sequence on two speeding trains. Before that theres the attempt at mythos. A boy dressed in a Lone Ranger mask and cowboy hat happens upon a wizened Indian (Depp) standing in a portion of an Old West diorama titled ""The Noble Savage."" The Indian comes to life and proceeds to spin a yarn of how in 1860s Texas when his skin was firmer and his posture more erect he met a prosecutor named John Reid (Hammer) and saved his life after a nut-job outlaw (William Fichtner) shot Reid and Reids brother (James Badge Dale) and carved out the latters heart. The undifferentiated mess that follows strains the capacity to care. There are too many scenes involving the dead brothers dull wife (Ruth Wilson) and their young son (Bryant Prince) holed up with the mean old train tycoon (Tom Wilkinson). Every once in a while Ill be at a movie and find myself reaching for the remote. I dont know whether my intent is to change the channel or fast-forward or hit stop but for long stretches of this movie I felt the urge to reach. More than once I looked over at the friend I brought to make sure she was still alive. I also looked over at her hoping for an answer to who this movies even for. People look at state-of-the-art mega-productions like this and assume that the dialogue and characterizations are as broad as they are because the movie has to sell action sequences that play well in movie theaters all over the world. Excusing the sound design the finale is an ear-splitting silent movie. And given the movies near-Bollywood length you can imagine other moviegoing cultures seeing the talking as a cue say to pee or hit the concession stand before the finales literal and figurative train wreck. Movies concocted for everybody risk boring a lot of people and Verbinski working again with the producer Jerry Bruckheimer isnt the kind of director who does well when the camera isnt following a body as it plummets over the side of a boat or into a cart of rocks. He seems to like toys far more than the people scattered among them. That finale is the playful Saturday-matinee stuff of the original Lone Ranger radio and television shows. Yet its such a generic contraption that all you see are the cranks pulleys and gears. This isnt the complete disaster of Wild Wild West but thats only because none of the 250 million was spent to turn Kenneth Branagh into a mechanical spider. The assortment of bad guys signifies movie villainy. Fichtner for instance has a messed-up mouth whose crowning feature is a permanently visible gold front tooth. One of his hairy young henchmen dresses like a baby doll because you know queers. The movie teems with corruption and sadism but you never feel the evil. Helena Bonham Carter is now veteran enough an actor to play the limping madam of Ye Old Wild West Brothel but the movie cant match even her dementia. Whats called for is the kind of cheap fun of something like 1999s The Mummy. That movie knew it was stupid but it believed in that stupidity It had the comical professionalism of 1950s crap. It also had Brendan Fraser doing upside-down heroism. Armie Hammer has Frasers willingness to make a fool of himself but Hammer is the more severely beautiful of the two. You feel like his Lone Ranger is making silly faces and doing goofy slapstick as contrition for Hammers looking as good as he does. But theres nothing to the part hes playing. So if youre inclined to think of him as a tree (J. Edgar proved hes not) all you can give him credit for here is stretching enough to play cardboard. But at least with him you can sense that he knows there might be children in the audience (the movie is PG-13) and that someone onscreen needs to be communicating with them. I suppose Depp speaks to them too. He gets mixed up in a lot of the stunt work commits to some mildly amusing nonsense involving grapes and spends most of the film with his nose turned up at all the killing and thieving and conquering as if to say with Kanye Wests disdain ""White people."" Depp would get away with it if the movie were willing to give more of itself over to him the way the first Pirates of the Caribbean surrendered to his lunacy. There are maybe three or four great summer-blockbuster performances in which a movies energy and entertainment come from somewhere other than the effects department and the stunt crew. Martin Lawrence did that in Bad Boys II. Robert Downey Jr. did that in the first two Iron Man movies and Depp did that his first two times as Jack Sparrow. But whats Depp inventing here? His Tonto is a dignified stereotype in search of the farce this movies too expensive to be. Hes Tim Burtons other better half (Bonham Carter is Burtons partner). But Depps now made five movies for Gore Verbinski too. And over the last 10 years more than half of the 18 movies that have prominently featured Depp have been directed and/or produced by those two men. Its been a steady diet of corpses and caricatures. I think the price has been his humanity. You worry that the more famous Depp has become the more he resents us for liking him. Seeing him alongside Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill in that 21 Jump Street remake from last spring was a welcome sign of life as self-referential self-reverential and simply meta as it was. The first Pirates franchise transformed Depp from a very good actor into a man with an astronomical asking price. In the decade since his trashed approach to stardom has gradually turned into shtick just as it has for Downey. The difference is that Downeys is fun and Depps is a parody of fun. Depps Tonto war paint speaks to the state of his stardom right now dried out.

Treat the genre with respect - as John Ford Sam Peckinpah and even Quentin Tarantino found - and the Wild West can be one of cinemas most unpredictable and exciting landscapes. But take it lightly and all youre left with is a bunch of silly hats sweaty horses and tired old matinee cliches. For the majority of its totally unnecessary 149-minute running time The Lone Ranger is a prime example of how not to go west its predictable derivative and at times quite spectacularly boring. Johnny Depp plays Tonto now an old man reminiscing about his days with the titular lawman played by six-foot personality vacuum Armie Hammer. Tonto rescues the Ranger from certain death at the hands of potentially supernatural villain Butch Cavendish (an underused William Fichtner) and together they ride for revenge.The Lone Ranger is by no means a total disaster. Depps Tonto may sail close to racial caricature but his performance is enjoyably robust and deadpan. More notably the film is bookended by a pair of absolutely crackling runaway train action sequences arguably director Gore Verbinskis best since Mousehunt. But its nowhere near enough to sustain us through the slow patches. With no trace of the freshness and wit Verbinski and Depp brought to the swashbuckler in their original Pirates of the Caribbean The Lone Ranger is content to simply pull another western trope out of the bag - the honky-tonk whorehouse the ranch raid the cavalry charge - give it a CGI spit-and-polish and chuck it in the general direction of the audience. The result is frustrating lazy and lifeless.

Apart from the credits it was often studio bound and cheaply made but as a kid in the late 50s I and my friends lapped up every episode often dressed like the kid in the film. Like the series this film is obvious in its plotting and yes it uses a lot of cliches from other better westerns but I liked its big brash stamping style. It was able to spend the bucks that werent available 60 years ago and give this boy a thrilling ride. However a memo to the producers no follow up film please to many good stories yet to be told.

Persoally I would have preferred if they had not tried to have Depp add the comedic and at times slap stick element to it and kept it a bit more serious. 4 / 10FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 20 2013HarveyNgFeaturedIn defence of the Lone Ranger I thought this was a very entertaining movie. I liked the use of references to the original radio programme and the old TV Show. I think that Johnny Depp is excellent as Tonto. I felt he worked well with Armie Hammer who played the main role as The Lone Ranger. Depp brings an edge to the role combining tragedy and comedy. The lines were really funny and the action was quirky in places which added to the light-hearted tone of the movie. The only fault I could find with the film was that I thought that it was occasionally too violent for the 12A certificate. My opinion of the negative reports is that they are unfair because the film doesnt deserve to be slated. I believe that many cinema audiences would agree with me. I strongly recommend to anyone who likes surreal tongue-in-cheek stprytelling that they go and see this thoroughly enjoyable film. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 16 2013fueldragsterFeaturedIm not sure what the professional critics were expecting it does not have the storyline strength of say ""Once upon a time in the West"" (probably my favorite western) but it certainly is not as crass as Django or many others. At times I was reminded of the recent Green Hornet/Kato pairing where the ""sidekick"" is far more important (agreed that Mr. Hammer was not the ideal choice which helps put some bite into Tontos disappointment at the ""resurrection"") and I reckon that your opinion of the film will rather depend on whether you go for Depps version of Tonto. I did. Do not expect modern day graphic violence it certainly has violent sequences but the worst bits are off screen and I regard it as a perfectly enjoyable and valid update on the old TV series. Locally it has slid down rapidly from screen 1 I would suggest that you give it a go on the big screen. If you are too late then it would certainly do as post Xmas lunch fare for all the family. FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 11 2013John CooperFeaturedFirst of all this is a much better film than is suggested by reviews including that of Time Out. The cinematography Johnny Depps performance the humour the runaway train sequences Hans Zimmers score and the fabulous William Tell overture are just a few of the positives in this latest take on the The Lone Ranger. Of course there are the negatives . . its over-long it suffers from multiple theme convolution and the narrative pace is uneven. However its eminently watchable and all in all is good all round 12A entertainment. Johnny Depps Tonto is even better than his Jack Sparrow and you cant blame him for the scriptwriters failure to find an aesthetically pleasing plot and structure . .. .One has to realize that director Verbinski took on a fiendishly difficult task in bringing the iconic Lone Ranger to the screen. You cant go for realism if your hero wears a mask and goes around on white horse shooting silver bullets. If you go for special effects you get slammed by the critics jealous of your big budget. You cant go for romance because everyone knows the Lone Rangers best friend is Tonto . .. . and a woman is just going to get in the way . . However I feel there is a better film in there somewhere and the director should have taken more pains to find it. Nonetheless this is an enjoyable film which really has to be seen at the cinema.. or at least a very large TV with a good sound system.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jul 3 2013 Culture DisneyAbout 20 years ago a friend of mine wrote an extremely witty screenplay for a revisionist-Western comedy based on the Lone Ranger. (It was never produced though it did win an award that paid for a year of film school.) The scripts premise was that the masked man himself was a tall good-natured schmuck and it was the long-suffering Tonto who was quietly running the show.The premise of Gore Verbinskis new blockbuster adaptation of the pulp cowboy classic is more radical still Its not Tonto whos the brains of the operation in this telling. Its Silver. Related Story White House Down Die Hard With a POTUS The Lone Ranger is a profoundly unsubtle--and equally ill-advised--effort to recapture the improbable charm of Verbinskis Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. But while its not a good movie neither is it quite the total train wreck implied by many reviews. (It does however wreck more than its share of trains.) The film has plenty of weaknesses--an unevenness of tone a surfeit of plot convolutions some problematic political echoes--but its central flaw is that it is absurdly punishingly overlong. Tucked away somewhere in its 149-minute running time there is a clever corny summer diversion lasting perhaps an hour and three-quarters. But this is the era of the Big Cinematic Event and if you dont want every single dollar of a 200-million-plus budget to be waved in your face--well you may as well stay home and watch TV.The story (by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio with an assist from Justin Haythe) is straightforward enough in its early contours A mild-mannered district attorney named John Reid (Armie Hammer) returns home to the Lone Star state following his big-city education. Upon arrival however he is deputized as a Texas Ranger by his decidedly manlier brother (James Badge Dale) in order to help capture the notorious outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). But things do not go according to plan and Reid ends up--at least to all appearances--dead. Luckily for him he is revived by a legendary Spirit Horse (whom he will later repay with the decidedly pedestrian sobriquet ""Silver"") and a tribe-less and quite possibly deranged Comanche named Tonto (Johnny Depp). Given that Reid is presumed by the world to be deceased his new partner persuades him to don a mask as they continue their quest to bring Cavendish to justice.Hokey? Of course. (And I havent even mentioned the framing narrative which features an impossibly wizened Tonto telling his story to a young boy at a carnival in 1933 San Francisco...) Yet theres a certain goofy grandeur to the movies first half or so. Hammer who played the fabulously wealthy Winklevoss twins in The Social Network--and is himself the great-grandson of the still-more-fabulously-wealthy oil tycoon Armand Hammer--is an amiable enough cinematic presence and Fichtner is magnificent as Cavendish snarling and sneering and eating the occasional human body part with demonic aplomb. Moreover as much as Ive tired of Depps burgeoning menagerie of weirdo performances his Tonto though perhaps politically off-key is at least charitably low-key. (For those who recall Depp in Jim Jarmuschs 1995 neo-Western Dead Man this is essentially a role reversal with him taking on the Gary Farmer part as a deadpan Native American sidekick to a clueless white man.)The movies early action sequences--in particular one thats set on a runaway train--are witty and inventive with Verbinski toying neatly with camera placement and spatial geometry. There are likable nods to Once Upon a Time in the West (in particular a railroad subplot and the oscillating dramatic score) Little Big Man The Searchers and The Bridge on the River Kwai. And the classic catchphrase ""Who was that masked man?"" is updated for a more ironic age to ""Whats with the mask?""But then somewhere around the hour-and-a-half mark The Lone Ranger makes the fateful decision not to end. Worse the movie keeps not-ending for another full hour. Unnecessary backstories unspool tiresome gimmicks get rolled out--look theres Helena Bonham Carter as a tough-but-decent prostitute whose wooden leg is really a gun--and dull new villains are revealed to be behind the perfectly compelling originals. The final action sequence (also set on a train) proves to be as exhausting as the first was amusing with the body count escalating unpleasantly and the William Tell Overture--used sparingly throughout most of the film--commencing to trample everything in its path.Somewhere around the hour-and-a-half mark The Lone Ranger makes the fateful decision not to end. Worse the movie keeps not-ending for another full hour.As cinematic sins go excessive length is hardly an original one. The delusion that bigger will always be better--that each additional plot twist will somehow signify ingenuity rather than desperation--is by now a fundamental operating principle in Hollywood. Blockbuster directors demand movies large enough to house their egos; the studios are in a state of near-constant panic (and theater owners even more so); genuine storytelling is migrating to television; a lengthy series of explosions translates seamlessly in Beijing or Rio de Janeiro; and on and on.But to quote Jerry Seinfeld somethings gotta give. Im sure if I set my mind to it I could name a recent big-budget film that would have benefited from greater length. But a list of the big-budget films that would have been substantially improved by a zealous trim is... well awfully similar to a list of big-budget films period. I cant say whether I might enjoy a Transformers movie that was under two hours long--but one reason that I cant say is because the ones that Michael Bay has offered up to us have clocked in at 144 149 and 154 minutes respectively. And its not just the summer blockbusters Les Miserables was a polished well-crafted film that labored under the misconception that viewers wanted to pass the 19th century in real time. And dont get me started on Peter Jacksons first installment of The Hobbit or like the movie itself I might never stop. The only 140-minute-plus movie of the past two years that I can recall fully earning its running time was Zero Dark Thirty.But on we go nonetheless with our Man of Steels and our Lone Rangers and our White House Downs with movies that seem at some point around the two-hour mark to gradually morph from honest efforts at entertainment into acts of mild cinematic bullying. That likable character actor hovering at the periphery of the plot will turn out to be the surprise villain-in-chief. Some idle incident from the first act will reappear as the crucial and in most cases nonsensical hinge of the climax. The anesthetic liberalism of the hero will give way to a reluctant (yet quietly gleeful) embrace of force. And a non-incidental number of cars/trains/buildings/cities/planets will be made to explode ostentatiously though with as little moral weight as can plausibly be arranged. The Lone Ranger hardly invented this formula. But seldom have its defects been laid so bare.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics.

The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Jul. 03 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jul. 03 2013 424PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Gore Verbinski Written by Justin Haythe Ted Elliott Terry Rossio Starring Johnny Depp Armie Hammer Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English Contrary to the conventional notion that corporations avoid risk Disneys new Lone Ranger movie certainly doesnt play it safe. Eccentric and misguided enough to be almost perversely fascinating the film doesnt lack nerve; its just not very good.Perhaps the first question is why Disney and the filmmaking team behind the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise (director Gore Verbinski producer Jerry Bruckheimer and writers Ted Elliott Terry Rossio and Justin Haythe) decided to invest more than 200-million (U.S.) in a bit of mid-20th-century cowboy kitsch about a masked lawman and his native sidekick Tonto. Based on a radio series (1933 to 1954) and subsequent TV show (1949 to 1957) the story would seem neither in demand nor politically sensitive. When it comes to mining boys adventure stories defaming pirates may be fair game but stories about western justice and native Americans? Not so much. Multimedia The Lone Ranger The official trailer To a degree the writers have recognized the problem by providing the story with some narrative finesse. Possibly taking a cue from the unreliable narrator in Arthur Penns Little Big Man (1970) The Lone Ranger begins in 1933 (the first year of The Lone Ranger radio show) at a San Francisco carnival where a boy in a Lone Ranger mask is startled when a half-clad figure in a sideshow diorama about Indians comes to life. The old man asks for some popcorn and tells the boy a story starting back in 1869 about how he first met the man who became the Lone Ranger.The old man presumably is intended to be a prankster or sort of spirit guide to the past though the idea is barely developed as more than a framing device. We first meet John Reid (Armie Hammer) a pacifist lawyer and free thinker (hes reading John Locke) on the archetypal train to the frontier when a gang of bandits attacks it to free a prisoner the outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). Tonto (Johnny Depp) is a prisoner in the same jail car. With a nod to the movies first action western Edwin Porters The Great Train Robbery (1903) and innumerable train-jacking movies since the assault on the train is a long elaborate and cleverly executed sequence. But that unfortunately is about as good as The Lone Ranger gets.Although they come from different backgrounds and philosophies the naive straight man John and the painted native shaman Tonto - who saves his life - join forces to fight against the notorious Cavendish and his henchmen. An assortment of familiar western types is displayed Theres a shady railroad tycoon Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) an honest sheriff whos also the Lone Rangers brother Dan (James Badge Dale) and his plucky wife Rebecca (Ruth Wilson). For good measure theres a blowsy madam (Helena Bonham Carter) who has a prosthetic leg that doubles as a shotgun.All of them seem essentially to be set-dressing. The central bromance between Tonto and the Lone Ranger is a variation on the revisionist western formula Jim Jarmusch used in his 1995 film Dead Man also starring Depp albeit with considerably less subtlety. Depp has said he intended his portrayal of Tonto to be more culturally sensitive than previous versions of the character. But using his usual grab bag of deadpan reactions and eccentricities Depp plays Tonto as a clown in white makeup wearing a dead crow on his head - which he apparently thinks is alive - and speaking in movie-Indian pidgin English (""Horse says you are spirit walker ...""). A midpoint explanation for Tontos behaviour as a result of his tragic past provides some excuse but the notion that exaggerating the stereotype somehow subverts it doesnt really wash. Tonto is in a freshly idiosyncratic way still a squirm-worthy character.Another problem is that Depps oddball performance feels separate from the rest of the film particularly overshadowing Hammers Lone Ranger. Though putatively the star character hes a consistently bland figure who transforms from milquetoast city slicker to straight-shooting lawman with little development.Throughout forced comedy and violent excesses are jammed together The Lone Rangers horse Silver for example is a magical creature that can apparently levitate which seems designed to appeal to children. But if so how does that jibe with a scene of Cavendish carving a mans heart out of his chest and eating it? Is this for fans of My Little Pony or The Silence of the Lambs?As with the Pirates films Verbinski progressively pumps up the spectacle from huge to preposterous with CGI-heavy scenes of charging locomotives horse races atop trains and massive collapsing trestles that provide all the suspense of looking at fantasy paintings on the sides of vans. The emphasis on the gargantuan scale if anything undermines the grandeur of John Fords famed locations of Utahs Moab and Monument Valley which is its own kind of insult to the history of the western.

"The Lone Ranger is all about Tonto review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Lone Ranger is all about Tonto reviewThe Lone Ranger isnt for traditional fans of the cowboy legend from 80 years of radio TV and film. But who is this bipolar oater really for?Johnny Depp plays Tonto for laughs in The Lone Ranger.  (Peter Mountain / Disney Enterprises)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. July 3 2013The Lone RangerStarring Johnny Depp Armie Hammer Tom Wilkinson and Helena Bonham Carter. Directed by Gore Verbinski. 149 minutes. Opens July 3 at major theatres. PGGiven his rebel instincts it may be beside the point to observe that Johnny Depps latest genre exercise is neither your fathers The Lone Ranger nor your grandfathers.Your dear pappy and grandpappy I trust would not tolerate a wimpy Lone Ranger or a mugging Tonto. Article Continued BelowBut if this isnt the Kemosabe and sidekick from some 80 years of radio TV and movie legend then who are these masked (and face-painted) men? And who exactly was this bipolar oater made for?Thats where we run into trouble pardners because Im not sure exactly what actor/executive producer Depp is up to with his co-conspirators director/producer Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer.With this riotous reboot they seem to be chasing modern moviegoers who prize action over storytelling and who also possess strong bladders -- the 149-minute running time makes this almost enough for two movies.But shouldnt these LoneRanger arrangers have decided whether they were doing send-up or serious? And shouldnt they have called the film Tonto since its really all about him?Almost every moment with Depp as Tonto is played for laughs beginning with the Buster Keaton/Keith Richards moves he also brought to his continuing Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. Hes added weird new tics for Tonto already a troublesome racial caricature. These include his habit of feeding grain to the dead crow on his head and the films strange framing technique of having Tonto recount his exploits decades after the fact while posing in a ""Noble Savage"" exhibit.Armie Hammers conflicted Lone Ranger in contrast is like Jimmy Stewart with a lobotomy. Hes all glum and no fun. Without the mask (which hes reluctant to wear) hes pacifist eastern lawyer John Reid. He abhors guns and also subscribes to the bizarre notion that the Wild West of 1869 is just itching to be civilized which it surely aint. Not when there are guys running around like the rapacious railway and empire builder Lathan Cole (Tom Wilkinson) and psychopathic outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). Thanks to the plodding pens of co-writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (more Pirates alumni) and Justin Haythe (Revolutionary Road) it takes a good two hours for the movie to finally live up to its title. Reid has to be coaxed and provoked into accepting the destiny that Tonto and a supernatural white stallion named Silver (Hi-yo) have been forcing upon him hes meant to not just wear the mask but also to heroically ride to ""The William Tell Overture"" (goosed by Hans Zimmer). This epiphany arrives just before the second and most elaborate of two action set pieces aboard and atop a speeding train a blur of inanities that would give a physicist a migraine. Its a reminder that the picture comes from studio Disney which doubtless has the plan of making a theme-park ride out of it one day. This would be a reversal of the course of Pirates of the Caribbean which began as a Disney ride before it became a blockbuster movie franchise.Disneys deep pockets and Verbinskis eye for detail also help make The Lone Ranger look like the real deal from trains to terrain. It was shot in four western U.S. states including Utahs picturesque Monument Valley site of many a John Ford western. The money is all on the screen with no sign of scrimping despite the studio-ordered trim of 45 million to the original 260-million budget. And for the films first hour it looks like it might have been money well spent especially during the first train action sequence when the Ranger and Tonto are literally chained to each other. Other aspects of The Lone Ranger arent like Disney at all. The film has a few dubious aspects that should make parents think twice before taking very young children to see the movie.The outlaw Cavendish doesnt just shoot people dead; he also cuts out their hearts and eats them. Is this really necessary?The movie also steals shamelessly from others theres a killer rabbit nicked from Monty Python and a whorehouse madam (Helena Bonham Carter) with a shotgun in her prosthetic leg an idea thieved from Robert Rodriguezs Planet Terror. This kind of stuff worked for Verbinskis Rango the bizarre animated western in which Depp voice-starred as a six-shooting lizard but its out of place here.Meanwhile theres a potential romance in the person of Ruth Wilson (Anna Karenina). Her character Rebecca catches the Rangers eye but not his full attention. Can this relationship be started let alone saved? Shes confused about the Ranger and so are we.

The Lone Ranger (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Lone Ranger (PG-13) More endurance test than a Wild West adventure. Johnny Depp as Tonto and Armie Hammer as The Lone Ranger. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/2/2013 Editor rating 2 Theres a rollicking Wild West adventure buried deep inside The Lone Ranger a bloated mega-budget revival of the story of the iconic gunslinger and his Native American sidekick Tonto. The movie is a spirited entertainment whenever it manages to take flight such as in two enormous action sequences that bookend the film set aboard speeding locomotives or the occasional comic exchanges between the masked hero (a square-jawed endearingly earnest Armie Hammer) and his bizarro mystical partner Tonto (Johnny Depp in subdued oddball mode buried under pancake makeup and wearing a dead bird on his head as a hat). When The William Tell Overture the Rangers theme song since his radio days in the 1930s finally blares on the soundtrack after being sneakily withheld for much of the picture the effect is so rousing that you levitate in your seat a little bit. But the rapture never lasts long. Director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have adopted the more-is-better approach they used in the Pirates of the Caribbean series to The Lone Ranger crowding the movie with so many extraneous characters and irrelevant subplots that the film becomes an endurance test dotted by patches of fun. There are not one but three villains -- a scheming railroad baron (Tom Wilkinson) a murderous outlaw (William Fichtner) and a corrupt U.S. marshal (Barry Pepper) -- who inflate the script with scenes of knotty dull exposition. The story is narrated in flashback at a diorama exhibit by an aged Tonto to an entranced little boy and every time the movie cuts away from the action and back to the kid the pacing stalls. Theres no purpose to the narrative device other than to allow an unrecognizable Depp to perform in old-man makeup. There are also two female characters (Ruth Wilson as the Rangers sister-in-law and Helena Bonham Carter as a one-legged brothel madam) who are here for no apparent reason other than to keep the movie from being an all-boys show. Carters scenes in particular cry out to be excised Her fake leg which is made out of porcelain and harbors a secret shotgun is a beautiful prop that the filmmakers obviously adore. But theres no room for such indulgences in a movie that already runs a punishing 2 1/2 hours. Made at a reported cost of a whopping 250 million The Lone Ranger certainly looks wonderful with beautiful John Ford-style vistas a score inspired by Ennio Morricone and action set pieces that minimize the use of CGI whenever possible. The film is also tinged with subtle touches of fantasy (the rumored werewolves never appear fortunately but there are some carnivorous bunny rabbits). But the tone is all over the place wildly veering from broad comedy to surprisingly dark horror -- a sign there was never a guiding vision behind the picture other than a movie poster and Depps bankability. And for all its attempts at historical relevance (the story explores everything from the exploitation of Chinese workers to build the railroads to Native American genocide) theres no gravity or weight to anything in The Lone Ranger. Everything is flung at you at the same pitch and speed at times relegating the two heroes to supporting characters in their own adventure. Hammer and Depp make an appealing pair -- they have genuine chemistry and theyre funny and likable together -- but they deserved a movie that matched their personalities. This plodding overwrought picture isnt it.

Inventively framed as a flashback the story starts in and returns now and then to San Francisco. It is 1933 and a wide-eyed kid (Mason Cook) wearing a white cowboy hat and a black mask is exploring the Wild West dioramas in a traveling carnival show. He stops at the window labeled ""The Noble Savage"" to assess a wizened stooped figure with a crow on his head. With the magic of a childrens fable the Indian comes alive. Behind the gobs of old-age makeup and prosthetics is Depp of course - you can ID the actor by the glint in his eye. He is Tonto and he gears up to tell the boy about John Reid a learned lawyer from the East who arrived in Colby Texas back in 1869 a copy of John Lockes Two Treatises of Government tucked under his arm. Several grisly deaths and crooked deals later Reid - played by the square-jawed Hammer - has had his ideals dashed and his metamorphosis into the incognito do-gooder is underway. Hes got the white horse the fancy bullets. And hes got Tonto an oddball Comanche with a dry wit and an even drier layer of paint caked to his face. Depp who has claimed hereditary connection to American Indians walks a fine line here - the buffoonery the broken English - but in the end his Tonto emerges with dignity and drollery intact. For the most part Hammer plays straight man to Depps enigmatic smart aleck and by the time the last runaway train and exploding bridge and silver-mine shoot-em-up is done with their bond is firmly established. It is folly to ask for economy from an enterprise with a reported 250 million production budget but The Lone Ranger gets to a point around the 90-minute mark (it continues for an hour more) where it can sometimes feel like The Long Ranger. One too many riotous chases and ricocheting rounds of ammo although the staging of these sequences - scary stunts seamless CG the surreal sight gag of a white steed perched in a tree - cannot be faulted. As for villainy take your pick Tom Wilkinson is all sinister charm as Latham Cole the railroad magnate with a maniacal plan; William Fichtner is Butch Cavendish a harelipped silver-toothed outlaw who eats the hearts of his victims - raw - and Barry Pepper is the cavalry captain carrying out orders unrepentantly violating the treaties with the Comanche Nation. And as for romance - never mind the burning bromance going on between our stars - there is the blue-eyed Rebecca Reid (Ruth Wilson) Johns sister-in-law. Once her husband is out of the way (see the aforementioned Cavendish) it should be smooth sailing for John and Rebecca. But then this whole Lone Ranger thing takes off. And The Lone Ranger despite its extravagant running time does take off. With tips of the 10-gallon chapeau to old Hollywood westerns (the John Ford vistas) and to spaghetti westerns (the Ennio Morricone-like soundtrack twang) Verbinskis opus oater looks beautiful and plays smart. And yes they even work kemosabe in there. Hi-yo Silver Away The Lone Ranger  (out of four stars) Directed by Gore Verbinski.

More than 50 years since his last round-up on television -- Im trying very hard to forget ""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" from 1981 and a 2003 wanna-be TV pilot -- that stalwart defender of womanhood and American virtue is back. Once again hes got that little black mask. Once again Silver is his steed and Tonto his faithful friend. Once again he rides into the thick of trouble silver bullets at the ready to disarm the villain and leave heroines gasping ""Who was that masked man?"" Aw who cares. Because for all its fuss furor and reported quarter-of-a-billion-dollar-budget -- theres no life here. Theres no joy. Theres just some very expensive cinematography and about three different movies packed in tighter than a dance-hall girl in a borrowed corset. For example theres the framing device which has an ancient Tonto (Johnny Depp in rubbery old-age makeup) telling the story of his life which apparently included a run-in with Custer or someone like him. (Thank you ""Little Big Man."") There are some shameless thefts from Sergio Leones great ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" which include not only the railroad-baron plot but specific sound effects. (The soundtrack even occasionally apes Ennio Morricones brilliant score.) The bulk of the movie meanwhile is an origin story that sticks pretty close to the characters radio-serial roots. John Reid is a newly deputized Texas Ranger -- and the only survivor of an ambush by the bandit Butch Cavendish. Nursed back to health by the Indian warrior Tonto he dons a mask and goes in search of justice. And although he literally wears a white hat -- well he doesnt really need to. This is the kind of upright cowboy who made John Wayne look like a yellow-bellied varmint. N.J.

After a long line of flawed film heroes itd be nice to have someone who could join Captain America and Superman in leading a Fourth of July parade. But when it stops borrowing from other movies -- when it has to decide what it really is -- ""The Lone Ranger"" gets lost. Is it a serious revisionist Western? Well kinda -- with a worldview thats completely opposite from yet just as blinkered as the old `30s oaters this is the sort of movie where Native Americans are impossibly noble victims and ""civilization"" can never be said without irony. Is it a modern comedy? Well yes that too with wacky gags about killer rabbits and Tonto all but rolling his eyes at the gosh-darn greenhorn hes been paired with. (The best and wildest joke has Helena Bonham Carter as a madam with a scrimshaw leg that doubles as a shotgun.) Is it just a movie built around another typically wacked-out Johnny Depp performance? Well yeah as the actor -- wearing a dead bird on his head -- alternates between going for easy laughs and talking mystic mush about ""the Wendigo."" Of course the Comanche probably wouldnt have heard of the Wendigo in Texas -- its a belief common to the tribes living in and around Canada. But then the movie has a band playing a John Phillip Sousa march about 30 years before it was written so who cares about historical or cultural accuracy? No one going to see ""The Lone Ranger"" perhaps. But what fans probably do care about is seeing a hero whos not just handsome -- as Armie Hammer indisputably is -- but heroic even inspirational. Discovering a Tonto who has an equal adult truly back-and-forth relationship with him. And thrilling to action sequences that have a clear sense of place and plausibility instead of just (badly) evoking scenes from Buster Keatons ""The General"" without Keatons brilliant compositions or cold-blooded willingness to risk his neck for a stunt. Thats what audiences want -- and thats not here. (And Disney -- which put off screening the film until it had practically opened -- clearly knows it.) Instead we just have noise and thunder and silliness and parts from three or four other better movies. I mean no wonder Depps in disguise. No wonder Hammer wears a mask. Wouldnt you?

"Review Not even Johnny Depp can rescue The Lone Ranger - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Not even Johnny Depp can rescue The Lone Ranger New Action-Packed Lone Ranger Trailer The Lone Ranger rides again in a brand-new trailer released by Disney today The Lone Ranger rides again in a brand-new trailer released by Disney today Kenneth Turan Film Critic Within the memory of those still living ""The Lone Ranger"" was a radio serial that broadcast 2956 episodes over 21 years as well as a beloved TV series that ran for an additional eight. Never in all that time was it thought necessary to have a villain who cut out human hearts and ate them but hey these are different days and even icons have to adapt or die.Its not clear whether the heart-eating episode was what producer Jerry Bruckheimer had in mind when he said he was going to introduce the ranger and his comrade-in-arms Tonto in ""a fresh and exciting way."" In fact the real problem with the new ""Lone Ranger"" is that for those who are familiar with the multibillion-dollar ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise there is little fresh or exciting about what we have here. More like ""Pirates on the Plains"" than anything else ""The Lone Ranger"" was directed by Gore Verbinski (who directed three ""Pirates"" films) and written by Justin Haythe and Ted Elliott amp; Terry Rossio (who wrote all four). Its got the same jokey tone big stunts and weird characters of its predecessors but even at an overlong two hours and 29 minutes it lacks any compelling reason to come on board.PHOTOS The Lone Ranger premiere For though it cost the earth (an estimated 250 million) and involved enough men and material to invade a small country ""The Lone Ranger"" exists without a convincing sense of jeopardy or more critically any place for audiences to emotionally connect. That TV show may have been modesty itself in terms of production values but we cared about its heroes in a way we do not here.Much has been made by the filmmakers about how this new version redresses the historic imbalance between the Lone Ranger and his Native American colleague Tonto by turning the erstwhile sidekick into a full-fledged crime-fighting partner. Although this may be true in theory the reality is quite different.Six-foot-five Armie Hammer certainly looks heroic but to make room for Tontos exploits his Lone Ranger character (civilian name John Reid) has been made into an incompetent tenderfoot. Hes a handsome fool who returns to his home in Colby Texas much like Jimmy Stewarts character in John Fords classic ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" with a belief in the power of the law over violence that is dangerously naive.This might be fine if Johnny Depps Tonto were interested in being anything close to conventionally valiant but anyone whos followed this one-of-a-kind actors career knows this is invariably the furthest thing from his mind. And unlike his wonderfully insouciant Capt. Jack Sparrow in the ""Pirates"" franchise Depp plays Tonto in a deadpan Buster Keaton style that is not well-suited to the demands of action and adventure. VIDEO Lone Ranger Qamp;A with Johnny Depp Armie HammerThe tone of this under-the-top performance is set by ""The Lone Rangers"" decidedly odd framing device. The year is 1933 and a small boy in full Lone Ranger regalia enters a Wild West carnival side show and is understandably perplexed when a statue of ""the Noble Savage"" turns out to be an ancient but living human being. Who might this mummified individual be so buried under layers of aging makeup that he looks as much like a tree as a person? It is Depp as Tonto hiding from the camera one more time as he relates the Lone Ranger story.Back we go to Colby in 1869 with railroad honcho Latham Cole (the always reliable Tom Wilkinson) proudly announcing that the railway that iron road to the future is about to arrive in town. On that very first train are eager law school grad John Reid notorious desperado and traditional Lone Ranger enemy Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and chained next to him the inscrutable Tonto.Waiting in town are hard-bitten Texas Ranger Dan Reid (James Badge Dale) who just happens to be John Reids older brother; Dans wife Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) who just happens to be an old flame of Johns; and Red Harrington (Helena Bonham Carter) a madam who just happens to have a scrimshaw artificial leg fitted with a small revolver. Its that kind of a movie.Though turning Cavendish into a fiend with a taste for human flesh is a departure ""The Lone Ranger"" does pay attention to the protagonists venerable origins story as Reid survives a Ranger massacre dons a mask and teams up with Tonto though here that pairing makes neither one of them happy.SET VISIT Under the New Mexico sky with Lone RangerA decidedly odd individual in a painted face who is always feeding the dead crow in his headdress (a look inspired by a painting by Kirby Sattler) Tonto is presented as a member of the Comanche tribe who has reasons of his own to be interested in Cavendish and the railroads Latham but by the time we find out what they are it is too late to care. In addition to using the Cavendish name this venture tips its hat to other aspects of Ranger mythology including silver bullets a horse named Silver and the phrase ""kemo sabe."" Its also good to see a big Hollywood feature shoot in Monument Valley for the first time in years though its odd to be told the location has been moved to Texas.And as satisfying as it is to hear snatches of Rossinis ""William Tell Overture"" and hear a stirring ""Hi-Yo Silver"" its just as sad to report that although this Lone Ranger is good at helping strangers rescuing his own film is beyond even him. kenneth.turanlatimes.com----------------------------------The Lone RangerMPAA rating PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence and some suggestive materialRunning time 2 hours 29 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Television Entertainment The Lone Ranger (movie) Johnny Depp Piracy Human Interest Movies Premiere The Lone Ranger Despicable Me 2 to beat Lone Ranger at Fourth of July box office Armie Hammer Native Americans on set loved Lone Ranger Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-lone-ranger-20130703,0,3532050.story",200,theloneranger12,theloneranger,latimes

Related links Arlington deli owner rides high in Lone Ranger movie By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1234am on Wednesday Jul. 03 2013 Wednesday Jul. 03 2013 Wednesday Jul. 03 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Hollywood continues to ransack through our collective pop-culture consciousness hunting for any shred of cherished memory to repacakge and sell back to us. So its no shock it stumbled across The Lone Ranger. Created in 1933 as a radio series about a masked cowboy hero and his Indian sidekick Tonto it has been revived in various formats over the years but its a good bet none of those versions is as nakedly opportunistic as Gore Verbinskis 250 million reboot starring Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp.Loud but with little to say beautiful but blank Disneys The Lone Ranger may be if not the weakest big-budget movie of the summer the most ill-advised. Worst of all its just not much fun. Verbinski and writers Justin Haythe Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio based their origin story on the one thats deeply ingrained as part of Lone Ranger lore. Told in flashback from the perspective of an elderly Tonto in 1933 it begins with John Reid (Hammer) a by-the-book lawyer who returns to his small Texas town to find theres an escaped criminal Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) on the loose.Butch and his buddies need to be taken out and its up to Reid and a posse of Rangers led by his brother Dan (James Badge Dale) to do the dirty work. But the Rangers prove no match for Butchs villainy and all end up cut down except for John whom is believed to be dead.Hes revived by Tonto who convinces him he needs to disguise his identity and then exact revenge. They become an unlikely duo the Simon amp; Garfunkel of the sagebrush as they go after Butch and later the powerful businessman Cole (Tom Wilkinson).By far Depp is the best thing about The Lone Ranger. His deadpan take on the noble savage stereotype provides the films few laughs while Hammer is only adequate as the Lone Ranger. To make things more politically palatable for the 21st century Verbinski alters the dynamic of the duo making the Lone Ranger brave and good-hearted but a little clueless while Tonto is very much his own man dealing with a separate set of issues involving his thorny relationship with the rest of his tribe. Helena Bonham Carter shoehorned into the plot as a madam with an artificial leg that doubles as a gun (shades of Quentin Tarantinos Grindhouse) doesnt have much to do beyond helping pad the almost 2 1/2-hour running time.There are also tonal problems as the movie lurches from outright comedic to surprisingly violent Butch carves the heart from a mans chest and eats it. Granted they dont show the act in detail but it still may be too much for younger children.At times in terms of its attempt at being a stylized lighthearted look at the Old West through the eyes of a square-jawed hero The Lone Ranger is reminiscent of the short-lived cult 90s TV series The Adventures of Brisco County Jr. But if Brisco was nimble and brash The Lone Ranger is just big and noisy. One plus at least its not in 3-D.If the storys not particularly compelling the natural beauty certainly is. Though theoretically taking place in Texas The Lone Ranger was shot mostly across scenic landscapes in New Mexico Colorado and Utah including Monument Valley acting as a visual tribute to some of the great Westerns of history shot by the likes of John Ford.This Lone Ranger wont be joining their ranks.

Actually let me take that back or at least rephrase it This mordant and ambitious work of pop-political craftsmanship both is and is not that movie. It delivers for my money the most exciting action sequence in any of this summers big spectacles (even counting the destruction of Tony Starks Malibu mansion in ""Iron Man 3"") a delirious chase-and-fight number staged on board a moving train - set of course to the William Tell Overture - thats equal parts stunt work digital effects and cinematic derring-do. But it also never lets you forget that the Manifest Destiny that drove Anglo-American society across our continent was a thin veneer pasted across a series of genocidal crimes.I can already tell Im going to be a lonely voice on this one so let me be clear ""The Lone Ranger"" has significant problems including the pairing of Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer as Tonto and the Lone Ranger which never pays off the way its presumably meant to. Verbinski veers back and forth between hard-hitting often violent dramatic episodes and the low-key farcical relationship between his two leads and the effect can be disorienting. Conventional wisdom has already decreed that this movie is a flop and so be it - dont let me stand in the way of some satisfying groupthink. Still I halfway believe that the discordant qualities of ""The Lone Ranger"" are intentional - and I know for sure that its an ambitious and inventive film thats always trying to tweak formula and play with audience expectations. If anything its overstuffed with imagination and ideas and when it comes to Hollywood movies I very much prefer that to the default setting. See it with an open mind and you may well be surprised.Lets back up for a second and consider Verbinski a director who gets short shrift from critics for reasons that are understandable but maybe unfair. He stayed with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise at least one movie too long - possibly because he was paid kajillions of dollars - and no doubt should create more distance between himself and the empire of producer Jerry Bruckheimer before he ends up directing ""Prince of Persia 2 More Sands of Time"" or the proposed ""Top Gun"" sequel. Except you know what? If Verbinski makes those movies Ill go see them eagerly. Hes made some less-than-good pictures but hes never made a boring picture or one that wasnt constantly trying to wriggle free of its genre conventions and push in unexpected directions. At his best as in the American remake of ""The Ring"" or ""Rango"" or the first ""Pirates"" he belongs on the very short list of Hollywood directors who try to apply an auteurist vision of cinema to the most commercial grade of mass-market commodity movies. (See also Nolan Christopher and Snyder Zack.)As for ""The Lone Ranger"" Verbinski and his credited writers (Justin Haythe of ""Snitch"" and ""Revolutionary Road"" along with the ""Pirates"" duo of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) are trying to do the impossible or at least the exceptionally difficult Capture the spirit of an old-timey square-bear western adventure serial aimed at kids and also make a dark-hued revisionist western with echoes of ""The Searchers"" ""Ride the High Country"" and ""Unforgiven."" While the depredations of the railroad barons serve as a plot point in many films and novels this story specifically recalls the themes and plot of Frank Norris tremendous 1901 California novel ""The Octopus"" (which may also have helped inspire ""There Will Be Blood""). Add to that the movies most headline-making aspect the casting of Depp in what amounts to a lead role as perhaps the most iconic and troubling of all ""good Indian"" characters a Comanche outcast who for reasons of his own rides alongside a masked white avenger. You Might Also Like It remains problematic to be sure to see a white movie star (whatever you think about Depps purported Cherokee great-grandmother) playing a 19th-century Native American in a crow headdress and black-and-white face paint delivering broken-English witticisms. But you cant claim that Depp (one of the movies producers) and Verbinski havent thought about the problems. Tonto is given a traumatic and complicated back story an agency and a painful destiny that have never existed before in any ""Lone Ranger"" iteration and his isolation from both his own people and the white world makes sense in a new way.Quite a few Native American actors appear in the film as Comanche warriors who are presented with tragic dignity. If anything these episodes in the film go in such a brooding and serious direction that some viewers may have trouble adjusting. Already consigned to a few hundred square miles in west Texas the Comanche are betrayed by unctuous railroad tycoon Cole (a fine slithery role for English actor Tom Wilkinson) and attacked by the U.S. Army - which believes incorrectly that the Natives have violated the treaty and raided ranches on the ""white"" side of the river. As Chief Big Bear (Saginaw Grant) tells the Lone Ranger when he falls into Comanche hands they know full well how the coming war with the whites will end ""We are already ghosts."" Whether Depps Tonto is a genuine Native shaman or a con man thriving on white gullibility is left up to the viewer but either way Tonto is the driving force that transforms Hammers John Reid a stick-up-the-butt Eastern-educated lawyer into the white-hatted gun-totin and perhaps literally undead Lone Ranger. In a framing device that definitely pushes the outer boundaries of the grotesque but nearly broke my heart an aging Tonto - working in a traveling Wild West show in the 1930s - tells the whole story to a small boy in San Francisco who shows up in a Lone Ranger costume.Reid just isnt a very interesting character unfortunately and the screwball-comedy episodes of ""The Lone Ranger"" when he and Tonto squabble like a mismatched rom-com couple range from mildly amusing to profoundly irritating. But for the most part Verbinski handles this films wild shifts in tone - a specialty of his work from the Brad Pitt-Julia Roberts thriller ""The Mexican"" onward - with aplomb. Even the films apparent villain a disfigured and sadistic outlaw named Butch Cavendish (played by the brilliant William Fichtner) is not who he appears to be. Killers like Butch only draw our attention away from the real criminals who wear nicer clothes and dont get their hands dirty.

This summer behemoth from Disney is modeled on the studios interminable Pirates of the Caribbean franchise though the idea of making the white hero an idiot and his nonwhite sidekick the brains of the operation owes more to Michel Gondrys tedious The Green Hornet (2011). Caked in white warpaint and wearing a dead crow on his head a stone-faced Depp fails to generate even the stinky charm of his mascaraed Jack Sparrow and in fact almost everyone here comes off badly.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Johnny Depp as Tonto left and Armie Hammer as the title character in ""The Lone Ranger."" (Peter Mountain/AP/Disney Enterprises Inc. ) By Ann Hornaday July 2 2013 Follow AnnHornaday Its an article of faith in a movie industry obsessed with chasing multiple demographic groups that no summer blockbuster can be only one thing. ""White House Down"" cant be just an action adventure; it has to be a buddy comedy. ""Man of Steel"" isnt only a science-fiction comic book movie; its a violence-heavy special-effects spectacle. ""Iron Man 3"" isnt just a special-effects spectacle; it has to have a little romance. ""The Lone Ranger"" starring Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp presents audiences with a case not just of ""both"" but ""all of the above."" A draggy reboot of the franchise Western that started as a radio series before it became a movie serial and a hit TV show this mishmash of styles genres and tonal shifts makes for a dizzying pastiche best described in terms of the many movies it references throughout its nearly 21 / 2-hour running time from ""Little Big Man"" Buster Keatons ""The General"" and the Monument Valley-set canon of John Ford to ""Dead Man"" ""Rango"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Those last three of course starred Depp himself. And it turns out that ""The Lone Ranger"" may best be understood and appreciated as one long baggy homage to Depp who addresses the myriad personae that have made him the worlds biggest movie star especially the tattooed bejeweled bohemian primitive that defines his off-screen look as well as the punched-up version when he plays Jack Sparrow. As Tonto the Lone Rangers perennially stoic and monosyllabic sidekick Depp both challenges and indulges in the caricatures that made Jay Silverheelss TV character such a lightning rod for Native American outrage. Depp plays Tonto as a sly sarcastic spirit warrior continually mugging and making with subtle put-downs of his earnest but dim crime-fighting partner. But his guttural pidgin English elaborate war paint and the ridiculous dead crow he wears as a headdress suggest that for all his desire to give Tonto the dimension and dignity he was robbed of for decades Depp owes his own dubious debt to the Noble Savage stereotype he claims to critique. Tonto and the Lone Ranger -- whose real name is John Reid -- meet aboard a train headed for a tiny Texas town in 1869 when the transcontinental railroad is about to be joined a businessman named Cole (Tom Wilkinson in full Snidely Whiplash mode) is about to make a lot of money and an outlaw named Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) is about to be hanged. Reid is a straight-laced law-and-order man who worships John Locke and doesnt believe in guns. But when Cavendish escapes then gruesomely murders Reids muy-mas-macho Texas Ranger brother in a suspicious ambush hes forced to hunt the malefactor down -- with the help of his newfound Comanche guide Tonto and a magnificent white horse they meet along the way. 1 of 31 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Summer movie guide 2013 View Photos Catastrophes superheroes sequels -- the months ahead have it all.

For showtimes trailers and reviews click the bold text in each item. The Kings of Summer June 7 Two best friends (Gabriel Basso left and Nick Robinson right) and one oddball interloper (Moises Arias center) decide to escape their stifling parents and live in the woods for the summer in director Jordan Vogt-Robertss feel-good feature debut. Chris Gallettas hilarious heartfelt script could turn this little dramedy into the breakout indie hit of the summer. A cast filled with established comedians such as Nick Offerman and Megan Mullally plus fresh talent including Arias (looking like the next Zach Galifianakis) provides plenty of laughs. CBS Films Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. But wait theres more Theres a comely sister-in-law (played by Ruth Wilson) a sharp-eyed ivory-legged brothel-keeper (Helena Bonham Carter) and her bevy of painted ladies there are flash-forwards to a carnival midway in 1933 and runaway trains and roaming buffalo and brutal massacres and war dances and cannibalistic rabbits. Theres fancy ridin and sure shootin and cross dressin and at least one instance of a man eating another ones heart (thanks Disney). Silver enjoys a wee dram of an evening Tonto is dealing with his own shadow material and Reid is unprepossessing enough that rather than breathlessly cry ""Who was that masked man?"" after theyve met him people simply cock their heads and wonder ""Whats with the mask?"" Presumably the myth will be burnished in future installments although its difficult to foresee ""The Lone Ranger"" becoming an international hit. No doubt the baby boomers who grew up with the original forms will smile when the William Tell Overture kicks in during the films climactic sequence but director Gore Verbinskis strenuous efforts to inject enough violence spectacle and action to make ""The Lone Ranger"" comprehensible to foreign audiences wind up making way too much of way too little. Whats more despite its impressively staged set pieces ""The Lone Ranger"" cant survive the epic train wreck resulting from its own tonal clashes wherein mournful scenes of genocide and stolen immigrant labor are tastelessly juxtaposed with silly slapstick humor and solemn historic revisionism abuts awkwardly with overblown computer-generated spectacle. One of the running gags of ""The Lone Ranger"" is that it was Reids braver cooler sibling who was always destined to be the real Lone Ranger When John Reid finally asks what ""Ke-mo sah-bee"" means Tonto replies that its Comanche for ""Wrong Brother."" As for the Comanche word for ""Wrong Movie"" well just have to guess. The Lone Ranger  (149 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence and some suggestive material. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

You may know that its based on a noble-masked-man legend so square rickety and out-of-date that when the last big-screen version of it appeared in 1981 the material already seemed like it was from another century. Yet even though I knew all of that and Im no big fan of the Pirates films (I didnt even like the original ""restrained"" one) the fact that Johnny Depp is playing Tonto the Lone Rangers poker-faced Comanche warrior/sidekick was enough to give me a tingle of anticipation as the opening credits rolled. Depp wears ghostly-white dry cracked mud all over his face set off by four black stripes (theyre a little like zebra markings and a little like tears). Atop his hat is a dead crow which he keeps feeding birdseed. Its as if Tonto knew something we didnt Hes either clued in to the spirit world or nuts or maybe a little of both. Clearly hes ""the Jack Sparrow character"" but Depp with eyes color-coordinated to his death-mask makeup makes Tonto very different than Jack. Hes not dissolute hes stern and controlled a figure off a wooden nickel come to life. With his me-speakum-wisdom-to-the-white-man epigrams he may be a racially tinged caricature of a Native American ""noble savage"" but Depp doesnt run from the stereotype. He bites into it and recontextualizes it and he also satirizes/embraces the more recent (and just as patronizing) image of the Native American as all-knowing mystical soothsayer. Thats the sly joke of Tontos presence Hes a pop-culture artifact that Depp twists around and makes kind of cool. Depp sets himself up as a scene-stealer and if the script (by Justin Haythe Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) had given him some great lines he alone might have made the movie worth seeing. But The Lone Ranger doesnt provide Depp with the level of zingers he needed; it gives him the dialogue equivalent of birdseed. You appreciate his stoic-joker presence but the joke doesnt detonate. Tonto first encounters John Reid (Armie Hammer) the Southern-born East Coast-educated district attorney who will become the Lone Ranger after Reid is shot and left for dead in the Texas desert along with half a dozen other men including his older brother (James Badge Dale). Even though the movie is being marketed to families its almost squalidly violent - and the slaughter is only there to set up a basic revenge plot. For a long time the priggishly fair-minded Reid in his silky three-piece suits doesnt seem to have a bloodthirsty thought in his head. Thats okay We dont want the Lone Ranger to be Charles Bronson. Yet we do want him to be a captivating hero. Armie Hammer for all his stalwart height has a smiling softness about him that makes the character a little too vague and wussy. Hammer doesnt command the center of the movie. He just sort of occupies it. Verbinski orchestrates a dense hectic conspiracy plot that hinges on the building of the railroads (and the railroading of Native Americans) and he fills the screen with scowling disreputable types who have no layers at all. Theres William Fichtner as the films chief sociopath a skinny rotter with burning eyes who suggests Iggy Pop as a black-hatted bad guy; Tom Wilkinson as a mustache-twirling Mr. Big whos out to make a fortune off the expansion of the rail system; Helena Bonham Carter as a jaded madam with a prosthetic leg made of carved ivory; and Barry Pepper as an Army captain whos styled to look like Gen. George Custer. (Given that the film is set in 1869 which was Custers heyday you wonder why they didnt just call him that.) All these characters are nasty but not one of them in a truly fun way. The fun of course should be in the Lone Rangers interplay with Tonto but the two lead actors strike very few oddball-buddy sparks. Maybe thats because The Lone Ranger in a virulent case of what seems to be this summers reigning blockbuster disease (call it BOSS - Boring Origin Story Syndrome) spends nearly all of its endless running time shuttling from one plot machination to the next before John Reid finally lets go of his high ideals puts on his black mask and white hat and truly becomes the Lone Ranger. Basically the movie is a two-hour set-up to a half-hour action climax which Verbinski stages like a louder more glossily impersonal Steven Spielberg. Still theres no denying that Verbinski is good at this stuff. When the train is speeding along and the Lone Ranger is riding his white horse on top of the train and Tonto is dancing to avoid bullets and a bridge the size of Hoover Dam is about to be blown up and The William Tell Overture is finally -- finally -- budda-bump budda-bumping away your heart races a little bit and you realize This is why I wanted to see this movie Of course the action climax just goes on and on making The Lone Ranger the sort of movie that delivers too much too late and still manages to make it feel like too little.

Theres a terrific scene in ""The Lone Ranger"" that reminds you it was directed by Gore Verbinski the crazily inventive skipper behind the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies. While two runaway trains careen down parallel tracks toward a dynamited bridge a masked lawman on a white stallion gallops through and atop the passenger compartments a fearlessly gymnastic Indian leaps and swings between the locomotives a damsel and her son evade pistol-packing outlaws from several directions and the cavalry charges through the rugged canyons -- all to the rousing tune of ""The William Tell Overture.""Unfortunately that scene is preceded by two hours of tedium.When a director saves all his powder for one final assault it ought to be a hanging offense. And here the wasted ammunition includes Johnny Depp the most dynamic actor in Hollywood. Despite the title first-billed Depp plays Tonto the poker-faced Comanche companion to Texas ranger John Reid (Armie Hammer). For no good reason we meet Tonto at a San Francisco carnival in 1933 more than six decades after the adventures that the old man will recount for a young fan of the ""Lone Ranger"" radio show.In 1869 pacifist lawyer Reid travels west to Texas to be the district attorney in a town where his brother Dan (James Badge Dale) is a lawman. Dan is married to Johns old sweetheart Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) with whom he has a son Dan Jr. On the same train as John are two shackled prisoners Tonto arrested for being an Indian and Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) arrested for being the low-down dirty varmint whose gang has terrorized the territory. In the first of too many handcuff-escape scenes Butch is freed from the train and goes on the lam. Dan deputizes John to join the posse. If youre familiar with the legend of the Lone Ranger you know that John is the only survivor of an ambush rescued by Tonto and given a mask made from Dans leather vest. In this version deadpan Tonto is skeptical about Johns courage to catch the outlaws and dubs him ""kemosabe"" meaning ""the wrong brother."" But the arrival of a mysterious white horse indicates that John is the spirit warrior who can catch Cavendish protect the widowed Rebecca and stop a railroad executive (Tom Wilkinson) from stealing Comanche land.Theres a lot of plot stuffed into this bloated movie but not as much action as summer-movie audiences would like not as much cross-cultural insight as history buffs would hope and not as much humor as Depps fans would expect. Except for the dynamite finale ""The Lone Ranger"" feels like a long slow ride to the dump to the dump to the dump dump dump.What ""The Lone Ranger""  Two stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 229  Content Sequences of intense action and violence and some suggestive material Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

At area theaters. You probably wont get saddle sores watching ""The Lone Ranger"" the extravagant reintrodution of the upstanding Western hero and his Comanche ally (dont call him sidekick). But you may develop restless leg syndrome as the film -- directed by Gore Verbinski and starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer -- gallops past the 2 1/2 hour mark. The 80-year-plus saga of the the masked man has its roots not in the west but in the midwest in 1933 where the radio show was first produced in the land of a different kind of horsepower Detroit. At least one of the pop culture phenoms trademark words came from a Michigan camp the producers father-in-law owned Kamp Kee-Mo-Sah-Bee which itself might have taken inspiration from an Ojibwe word. This bit of pop culture rummaging would be a lot more compelling were the movie itself more thrilling. Instead ""The Lone Ranger"" is too often as vast and empty as Utahs Monument Valley ( Colorados own Creede gets a few brief cameos). Only the films wide stretches arent awe-inspiring so much as tiring. The movies framing device finds a boy in chaps wearing a mask over his eyes entering a tent at a Wild West exhibition in 1933. In one glass showcase a skinny ancient Indian stands in waxed figure stasis with a dead crow as headdress. The leathery soul turns to the boy and begins his tale of whoa hi-ho and of one ramrodstraight kemosabi. Consider Tonto a deadpan Boswell recounting the transformation of John Reid (Hammer) into the Lone Ranger. Tontos makeup created by Oscar winner Joel Harlow is one of the most amazing effects in a movie rife with train crashes explosions shoot outs and multi-trick ponies. His story plunges us into Colby Texas in 1869 as railway magnate Latham Cole (a finely underhanded Tom Wilkinson) lays the rails that will connect the nation but also traverse Comanche territory. Its a world of bold possibility and bolder betrayal. And writers Justin Haythe Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio strive to offer a post-modern view of the more arrogant aspects of Manifest Destiny. When Reid returns to his home state from back East the idealistic lawyer carries a volume of John Locke the philosopher of rationalism and tolerance under his arm. Yet Reids not quite prepared for the west his older brother Dan (James Badge Dale) knows well. Dan is a Texas Ranger called away from wife Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) and his young son in the name of rough-and-ready justice. Hammer (""The Social Network"" and ""J. Edgar"") brings a kind of Gary Cooper handsomeness and self-consciousness to the role that should work but doesnt quite charm. Tonto consistently jokes about John Reid being the lesser brother. Its probably not good that even at the end of the movie we tend to agree. The filmmakers also work to make sure the Native American is the hero -- or co-protagonist -- and not just because the guy who portrays him remains one of the most beloved movie stars in the country. The cast is muscular. In the dodgy but effective tradition of deformity signaling lawlessness villain Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner ) wears a nasty scar on his mouth and is known for his bigotry toward Indians. Holding her typically weirdly own as brothel owner Red Harrington Helena Bonham Carter plays the smart whore to Wilsons thoughtful if underutilized Madonna. Red has an ivory prosthetic leg that mesmerizes and more. ""The Lone Ranger"" is hardly a careless enterprise The production design costumes and makeup are expert. Clever touches abound. Yet the expensive adventure too often feels as hollow as -- okay more hollow than -- Reds beckoning appendage.

"Lone Ranger The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; lone-ranger-the ) Lone Ranger The (United States 2013) July 02 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli A fiery horse with the speed of light a cloud of dust and a hearty ""Hi-yo Silver"" - the Lone Ranger With his faithful Indian companion Tonto the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains led the fight for law and order in the early West. Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear. The Lone Ranger rides again Those words spoken at the outset of every radio and early television broadcast of The Lone Ranger defined the experience of listening to or watching them. Though the final TV season was in color my memories of The Lone Ranger are in black-and-white. Theyre also of a hero whose time has passed. He hails from a more innocent age and attempts to ""modernize"" him fail because they lose the essence of what defined the character. The version of The Lone Ranger in Gore Verbinskis movie is just some guy in a mask riding a white horse. Hes not the character essayed most memorably by Clayton Moore. And though the story is mostly faithful to the established origin of the character its not until the last 15 minutes when ""The William Tell Overture"" arrives in its full glory that this starts to feel a little like The Lone Ranger. But thats too little too late. And when The Ranger (played here by Armie Hammer) finally shouts ""Hi-yo Silver"" the moment is spoiled by turning it into a joke. Apart from considerations about the mediocre overlong nature of the film there are reasons why the level of buzz and anticipation are so anemic. For the most part the under-40 crowd has no connection to the character; the TV show probably hasnt been shown in syndication since the late 1970s or early 1980s. It also has another big strike against it with young viewers its a Western and thats not a popular genre these days. Older viewers who might be attracted to the name are understandably skeptical. They see no reason for the story to be retold and all things considered they would rather wait to see this on video. Thats not something Verbinski or Disney wants to hear but its the truth. One could make a compelling case that Verbinskis Pirates of the Caribbean succeeded in large part because of Johnny Depp. Conversely it could be argued that The Lone Ranger fails because of him. His interpretation of Tonto is weird and off-putting. This isnt the noble heroic figure brought to the small screen by Jay Silverheels. This is Capn Jack in moccasins and with face paint. And because Depp is the big name in the credits Tonto gets the more showy material. Hammers Ranger is dull and one-dimensional in large part because hes forced to play The Straight Man. The warmth and charisma that humanized him in the TV series is absent. Meanwhile Tontos bizarre behavior is encapsulated by a costume detail he wears a dead bird on his head and occasionally tries to feed it. The Lone Ranger tells of The Masked Mans birth and early days. The sole survivor of an ambush John Reid is rescued and nursed back to health by Tonto. Once hale he mounts his snow-white steed whom he later names Silver and sets out to deliver justice to those who killed his brother Dan (James Badge Dale) and the rest of his group. The chief miscreant in all this is Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) but hes only part of a larger conspiracy. The Ranger is also given a love interest in the person of his late brothers wife Rebecca (Ruth Wilson). And as befits a movie taking place in the Wild West there are plenty of trains to provide a rousing climax. Verbinski apparently learned all he needed to know about the laws of physics and human endurance by watching The Fast and the Furious series. Both John Reid and Tonto appear to be indestructible which effectively limits the degree of tension. Verbinski overcooks his stunts as he is wont to do but it doesnt work nearly as well here as it did in Pirates of the Caribbean. For one thing the tonal inconsistencies are a barrier to full enjoyment. At times The Lone Ranger wants to be a goofy semi-spoof of the old series. Then it shifts into grim territory as in scenes where Cavendish carves out and eats the heart of a victim or when Indians are massacred by U.S. cavalrymen using a machine gun. The overall structure is also odd with a prologue an epilogue and a few interludes taking place some sixty years in the future when Tonto has become a decrepit figure in a traveling road show. The Lone Ranger revels in its sense of excess but it doesnt get fun until that final twenty minutes. Its hard to deny that the final chase in and around two moving trains is entertaining and ""The William Tell Overture"" helps things immensely. Thats the only part of the movie when Hammer seems to be channeling the real Lone Ranger. As a Western action-comedy this finds a middle ground between the awfulness of The Wild Wild West and the solid entertainment of Maverick. Verbinski gives a nod to the TV series by desaturating color in some scenes thereby reducing almost everything to a monochrome. Somehow that seems to be an appropriate metaphor for a motion picture thats tone deaf and wasteful of blockbuster dollars. The Lone Ranger will continue to ride in the memories of fans but this is likely the last time hell ride in a major motion picture.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review The Lone Ranger Lost in a Western Myth Johnny Depp is Tonto and Armie Hammer his kemo sabe in this overly ambitious tribute to the vanished art of the sagebrush saga By Richard Corliss July 02 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Peter Mountain / Disney Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture Johnny Depp loves westerns. He starred in Jim Jarmuschs corpse opera Dead Man in 1995 and made his directorial debut two years later with The Brave a surpassingly weird modern sagebrush saga in which he played a luckless American Indian who agrees to appear in a snuff film produced by Marlon Brando. In 2011 Depp teamed with Gore Verbinski his director on the first three Pirates of the Caribbean movies for the animated feature Rango a tribute to every oater about a stranger who wanders into a threatening western town -- except that this Man With No Name is a lizard. ""I think the western has been hiding a bit"" Verbinski told TIME. ""The Pirates movies were westerns Star Wars is a western. Its nice to see it in the West again."" The West looks mighty handsome in The Lone Ranger the latest Depp-Verbinski tribute to a genre that dominated Hollywood for decades then died out when Star Wars and other action pictures transported sheriffs and shoot-em-ups to Fantasy Land. Filmed in scenic New Mexico with side trips to Utahs Monument Valley Arizonas Canyon de Chelly and Colorados Durango The Lone Ranger revels in the actual (as opposed to virtual) grandeur of an arid land worth fighting for. Jerry Bruckheimer the producer behind the Pirates movies made sure that all of Disneys 250 million investment is on the screen. Having sired a bunch of Hollywood franchises (Beverly Hills Cop Bad Boys National Treasure) Bruckheimer is hoping this can pick up where the others left off. (MORE Corliss Reviews the first Pirates of the Caribbean Movie -- the Good One) The movie is deeply indebted to three great films set during or just after the Civil War John Fords The Searchers (a mans quest for his brothers killer in Indian lands) Sergio Leones Once Upon a Time in the West (the coming of the transcontinental railroad) and Buster Keatons The General (the climactic train chase). A framing story set 60 years later in San Francisco pays unacknowledged tribute to Arthur Penns Vietnam-era revisionist western Little Big Man. And although the Hans Zimmer score contains so many airs from Ennio Morricones themes for the Leone westerns that it comes close to copyright infringement theres nothing wrong with this kind of pilfering. If youre going to steal why not from the best? Scripted by Ted Elliott Terry Rossio and Justin Haythe The Lone Ranger wants to be the apotheosis of every durned western ever made. Aside from the Masked Man and Tonto played by Armie Hammer and Depp respectively the movie corrals the whole Tombstone contingent a flinty sheriff (James Badge Dale) the scurvy villain Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) a railroad baron of dubious intent (Tom Wilkinson) a U.S. Cavalry officer (Barry Pepper) a winsome widow (Ruth Wilson) and a bordello madam (Helena Bonham Carter) with a gun concealed in her ivory leg. Finding scenes and plot strands to accommodate this crowd stretches the running or ambling time to nearly two-and-a-half hours and lays bare The Lone Rangers secret sins its got too much on its mind and its unsure of its tone. This is the rough cut of a slimmer better movie. (MORE Why Rango Was the Best Animated Feature of 2011) Fran Strikers 1933 Lone Ranger radio drama spawned two late-30s cliffhanger serials directed by William Witney and John English plus the 1949-57 TV show starring Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels familiar to kids who are now eligible for Social Security. But unlike Superman and Batman two other heroes from 1930s pulp culture the do-gooding John Reid -- the Lone Ranger -- didnt secure an honored place in the pop-mythology pantheon. If any questions still stir about the character they would be 1) Why is he the lone Ranger? 2) What is the reason for his mask? 3) Why is his horse called Silver? 4) What is the significance of the silver bullet? 5) How did he meet Tonto? 6) Isnt Tonto Spanish for stupid? 7) What does Tontos familiar phrase ""kemo sabe"" mean? And 8) Whats that theme song again? (Fast answers which may require a SPOILER ALERT for those not up on their L.R. lore 1) Because John Reid was deputized into a Texas Rangers contingent whose other members died. 2) To conceal his identity from those who knew Reid. 3) Because the horse is silver-white. 4) A symbol of justice. 5) In the radio series the TV show and this movie Tonto saved Reids life when the Rangers were ambushed by Cavendish. 6) As the new movie suggests its complicated. 7) In the radio show ""scout""; in the movie ""wrong brother."" 8) Gioachino Rossinis William Tell Overture.) (MORE A TIME Gallery of Famous People Who Have Worn Masks) Narrated (for no particular reason except to make a long movie even longer) by an aged Tonto to a kid in a Lone Ranger mask the movie proposes that its leading man is a well-meaning oaf with no sense of hero couture. When at Tontos insistence he dons the mask he asks like a self-conscious actor forced to wear jesters garb ""You sure this works?"" He also seems not to know that the Lone Ranger is supposed to have a partner several times he leaves for dead the Indian who has saved his life. Hammer who played the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network and Snow Whites Prince Charming in Mirror Mirror is pretty but not prepossessing -- good-looking in a soap-opera-actor way without seizing the screen. Hes all hunk no cattle. Really this Lone Ranger is Tontos stooge. So Depp his face chalked up in Indian daubs (based on Kirby Sattlers painting I Am Crow) gets the job of cluing modern audiences into the Lone Ranger legend and for that matter the meaning of westerns. To the image of the taciturn Indian he applies the comic solemnity of Keaton the silent cinemas Great Stone Face whom Depp explicitly revered back in 1993s Benny amp; Joon. He has long been a master of what might be called the overplaying of underplaying -- that blank sometimes sodden stare that surveys the worlds awful idiocies and says ""If I expressed what I really felt Id always be screaming."" Its an act of subversion that can also wink at audiences with a sense of complicity in their discomfort at a not-so-hot movie. (MORE A Tribute to Buster Keaton) Depps classical-modernist take works for about an hour until The Long Ranger wanders into many variations of plot quicksand that confuse viewers about what kind of movie theyre watching. We know that the town burgher is a corporate villain; when asked what he could buy with all his loot he replies ""A country. A great country."" But the varmint outlaw who carves out and devours his victims heart -- is that one of the funny parts? And the brief appearance of a horde of animated killer rabbits -- perhaps an outtake from Rango? After a while you need a diagram to keep track of the shifting tones gentle homage or up-to-date political correctness; cannibal violence or the light smirky touch of the Pirates series. This need to both embrace and ironize so many western cliches sends the project stumbling until it falls flat on its facetiousness. So The Lone Ranger is likely to join the list of Bruckheimer wannabe franchises like Prince of Persia and The Sorcerers Apprentice. (MORE Corliss on Prince of Persia and The Sorcerers Apprentice) Even if it worked the movie probably wouldnt connect with the worldwide mass of moviegoers because ... its a western. The films that have borrowed from that genre were smart enough to add space ships giant monsters and a palette more colorful than Monument Valley brown. At least Verbinskis picture fails not from caution but from ambition -- a missed attempt at the magnificent. Like a stuntman doing a swan dive off a high butte in some glorious old John Ford movie The Lone Ranger falls from a great height.

By MICHAEL SRAGOW / ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The Lone RangerStarring Johnny Depp Armie Hammer Tom Wilkinson William Fichtner Behind the scenes Directed by Gore Verbinski Rating PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence and some suggestive material Running time 2 hours 29 minutes Playing Opens at 7 p.m. July 2 throughout Orange County (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitThe Lone Ranger and Tonto ride again and Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp give them humor and personality but the Old West is so morally ugly in this revisionist pulp epic that it barely seems worth saving. Grade C+ Not even performers as game as Armie Hammer in the title role and as inspired as Johnny Depp as Tonto can yoke the divergent ambitions of Gore Verbinskis ""The Lone Ranger."" With a new origin story for ""the masked rider of the plains it attempts to reboot and spoof this ultimate white-hat hero while elevating Tonto as a Native American champion and rehashing every influential Western or railroad movie ever made. Although its more fun than ""Man of Steel"" its just as relentlessly over-complicated and almost as brutal and sour. Straight arrow John Reid still becomes the Lone Ranger and once again he defeats the bad guys. But maybe we should call them ""the worst guys."" Theres no room for the pioneer spirit in this revisionist movie about the transcontinental railroad and theres no supporting cast of sturdy homesteaders to cheer our heroes on. Even our heroine Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) is conflicted. She has always yearned for John but she married his brother Dan a Texas Ranger who often leaves her and their son alone on the farm. Lusts for silver and power are all that drive the Westward Expansion in this movie. The most admirable characters are the stoical Comanche Indians. Theyve been set up to look like theyre breaking treaties and raiding settlements. But their chief tells the Lone Ranger that getting out the truth is pointless because ""Were already ghosts."" As Martin Mull used to say on ""Fernwood 2 Night"" its hard to get happy after that. The theme music from Rossinis ""William Tell Overture"" swells up on the sound track but it doesnt rouse the expected surge of nostalgic feeling. This films warring impulses short-circuit your emotions. For example you laugh as Dan Reids Rangers swap stories about the notorious outlaw Butch Cavendish eating a ""Red-leggers heart in the Missouri wars"" - or maybe it was ""the eyes and he used a toothpick like a pair of pickled onions."" You think theyre merely playing ""Can you top this?"" But in the key part of the origin story the Cavendish gang ambushes the Rangers - including the newly deputized John - and Cavendish really does cut out Dans heart and eat it. The movie goes back and forth between tall tale and frontier horror. Director Verbinski doesnt find a way to mesh comedy and sadistic violence They nullify each other leaving the audience in limbo. Helena Bonham Carters one-legged madam Red Harrington semi-subtly suggests that Cavendish cut off and ate her lost limb. And some men do salivate over her scrimshaw leg. The film keeps oscillating madly. A realistic massacre of Indians - a slaughter thats genocide in miniature - butts up against a sequence of epic mechanical slapstick that pays homage to Buster Keaton. What a wasted opportunity Hammer with his square good looks and strapping physique fits right into the buttes and mesas of Monument Valley the dominant location. His air of noblesse oblige and courtly comic manner suit this films version of John Reid in his pre-Lone Ranger days as a Harvard-trained lawyer. He returns to Colby Texas carrying John Lockes treatises on government in his hand and hoping to become a righteous District Attorney. He travels on a train carrying stern-looking Presbyterians singing ""Shall We Gather At the River?"" (one of several nods to ""The Wild Bunch"") as well as in a prison car the fearsome Cavendish (William Fichtner) and the outwardly inscrutable Tonto. The movie audience meets Tonto before his future partner does in a framing device set at a Wild West exhibit in a 1933 San Francisco fairground. In the films most successful absurdist stroke Tonto standing like a statue in a diorama called ""The Noble Savage in his Natural Habitat"" sees his sole admirer -- a tyke in a Lone Ranger mask - and mutters ""Kemosabe?"" He ends up relating the whole sprawling saga to the little boy. Tonto starts by reminiscing about the time he and the Lone Ranger robbed a bank. The young fan of the ""Lone Ranger"" radio show protests that the real team would never have robbed a bank. ""There comes a time when a good man must wear a mask"" Tonto explains. The building of the railroad has attracted an unsavory collection of plutocrats hustlers opiate-peddlers and prostitutes. Even the top railroad man a Civil War hero named Latham Cole (Tim Wilkinson) rouses our mistrust by ogling Rebecca. The lowest of the low is Cavendish. Back on the railroad in the first of many whirligig reversals Cavendish frees himself. Then Tonto loosens his chains and is about to blow the varmint away when John Reid halts the execution - he wont allow vigilante justice. This one act will tie Tonto and John Reid together and lead them to expose a chain of greed and corruption that connects financiers thugs and the U.S. Army. Everything will be explained including why Tonto seeks vengeance against Cavendish and wears a dead bird on his head. A breathless climax involving two runaway trains caps a series of extravagant set pieces with gravity-defying camera moves and death-defying stunts. Yet the movie lacks a unifying animating spirit. Its best moments come when Tonto nurses John Reid back to life after Cavendishs ambush. The Lone Ranger persona gets filtered through Tontos mystic vision. The Comanche fashions a mask out of Dan Reids leather vest. (""Eyes cut by the bullets that killed him"" Tonto says. ""From the Great Beyond he will protect you ... and the ones you love."") Tonto says the horse that will be known as Silver has proclaimed John ""a Spirit Walker - a man who has been to the other side and returned and therefore cannot be killed in battle."" Depp both heightens the hokum and makes it amusing. His layered and freaky deadpan intensity keeps you wondering whether Tonto is full of mystic wisdom or insane especially when he feeds birdseed to the deceased crow (ad nauseam). Hes unconventional without being arbitrary so banal lines carry the snap and crackle of surprise and good jokes really pop. Depp has the gift of stylization that the filmmakers lack. He looms so large they could have called the movie ""Tonto.""

Starring Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer. Directed by Gore Verbinski. (PG-13. 149 minutes.) ""The Lone Ranger"" produced by Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer is an action-movie bloodbath for a childrens audience. It has horse manure jokes for the kiddies as well as scenes of an Indian tribe getting wiped out a posse of rangers getting shot to death and an intimate interlude in which a man has his heart cut out. In the latter case you dont actually see the heart being ripped from the body just the sound of the cutting and hacking. But put aside the notion that children shouldnt see this film. No one should. ""The Lone Ranger"" is a movie for the whole family ... to avoid. It represents 2 1/2 of the longest hours on record a jumbled botch that is so confused in its purpose and so charmless in its effect that it must be seen to be believed but better yet no. Dont see it dont believe it not unless a case of restless leg syndrome sounds like a fun time at the movies. Johnny Depp as Tonto is not the problem. Within the limitations of the miserable script his worried deadpan take on the Lone Rangers faithful sidekick borders on funny and the word ""kemosabe"" rolls off his tongue as if hed been saying it all his life. He mugs and pushes and sometimes cant borrow a laugh - even at a preview with a hyped-up audience - but what is Depp supposed to do? Lie there and give up? Actually what hes supposed to do is say no to movies like this but once the mistake has been made he has only one play which is to plunge ahead and chase away the looming possibility that hes stuck in the biggest stinker of 2013. Aside from all its little problems ""The Lone Ranger"" has three big ones The first is that the character of the Lone Ranger is that of a contemptible idiot. The second is that the Lone Rangers friendship with Tonto barely exists. (Tonto is too cool to be devoted and the Lone Ranger is too much of a smug dummy to have emotions that count.) The third is that the filmmakers have no non-mercenary purpose in resurrecting the Lone Ranger as a character. All they know is that whatever happens American Indians have to come out looking OK. The movie takes about 40 minutes just to crank its plot into motion John Reid (Armie Hammer) who will soon emerge as the Lone Ranger wants to capture a sadistic outlaw (William Fichtner) and bring him to justice. He is joined by Tonto because Tonto is under the impression that Reid is a special spirit who cant be killed. So right there you have Tonto caring for Reid for reasons that are impersonal and you have Reid not caring for Tonto at all. You know what? If they dont care we dont care. That seemingly simple throughline becomes contorted and convoluted when set against the linking of the first transcontinental railroad. East and west joined together at Promontory Utah in 1869 an event replicated here only without President Ulysses Grant in attendance. Having a sitting president on the scene just wouldnt do especially as our heroes by this time are intent on blowing up the whole thing the tracks the trains the bridges ... Dont ask. The Lone Ranger might have been too corny for a straight reimagining but to turn the title character into a moron-antihero and Tonto into a bloodless vacancy was no winning alternative. Two of the movies three screenwriters were collaborators on the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies and ""The Lone Ranger"" shares a family resemblance with that series It has the clumsy shifts in tone the lack of motivation the deliberately conflicted alliances the mishmash of characters the desperately boring action sequences (because who cares?) and the arent-we-cute treatment of the protagonists. It has that other thing too the sense of a movies being stretched to epic length in some vain hope that people might mistake it for an epic. Gore Verbinski who directed the ""Pirates"" movies directs this too and there are two moments to make you realize that Verbinski doesnt have to make bad movies. He just chooses to. The first is an opening shot of San Francisco in 1933 which shows the Bay Bridge under construction then swoops down to introduce a boy at a carnival. Nice work pretty and graceful. The second is the depiction of the seconds before a Comanche attack. Theres something in the air something alive in the silence like right before the feds slaughtered Bonnie and Clyde. Also good. Thats 45 watchable seconds. When Verbinski can figure out a way to do that 120 times in a row hell really have something. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Lone Ranger finds Gore Verbinski reviving the classic radio and TV serial the only way he knows how by way of an ironic overstuffed adventure movie. As in Verbinskis Pirates Of The Caribbean films and Rango Johnny Depp serves as the weirdo emcee leading the audience through a 149-minute bill of visual gags left-field references bit characters John Ford and Sergio Leone impressions and eccentric framing devices. Armie Hammer stars as the title character a prissy city boy who arrives in a company town by train gets shot and left for dead and is then saved by an Indian outcast who believes that Hammer is a ghost. Viewers who recognize this as the plot of Jim Jarmuschs Dead Man will be rewarded with further references a cannibalistic gunslinger a cross-dressing outlaw in a bonnet and the sound of Depp uttering a bowdlerized version of Dead Mans signature line. Like Rango The Lone Ranger substitutes pastiche for plot; the opening of Once Upon A Time In The West and the climax of Buster Keatons The General are both quoted extensively and there are throwaway nods to everything from The Red Balloon to There Will Be Blood. Whatever imagery is original to The Lone Ranger tends to be imaginatively grotesque a brothel-keeper who hides a gun in a prosthetic leg carved from whale bone a brass band performing in plaster casts and slings a drowning man being pummeled with rocks. Though it lacks the sustained manic energy of Rango or Pirates Of The Caribbean Dead Mans Chest The Lone Ranger is crammed with enough fun matter--rollercoaster train chases fourth-wall gags--to compensate; the slower scenes are at least interesting to look at thanks to Verbinskis detail-packed compositions. Hammers performance--always game never mugging--certainly helps; his likable but buffoonish Lone Ranger is an essential part of the movies irreverent tone. The Lone Rangers major weakness--aside from its running time--is its portrayal of Depps Tonto. It attempts to modernize the Lone Rangers sidekick--though not by changing the character who remains a pidgin-speaking quasi-mystic. Rather it changes his context; instead of being presented as an archetypal noble savage Tonto is portrayed as an outsider regarded by the other Comanche--who are more concerned with treaties and boundaries than animism--as mentally ill. Hes a sad pariah who has dealt with trauma by retreating into a fantasy world inspired by childrens bedtime stories. Its a clever bit of revisionism but it doesnt entirely work because in trying to paint Tonto as a demented do-gooder The Lone Ranger ends up falling back on the same Western iconography that its supposed to be subverting.

Surely it has never been given such a strange rendition as in the latest failed movie adaptation. The film is a bloated incoherent would-be epic that stumbles like a horse that stepped in too many plot holes and came up lame. The film opens in 1933 with the ancient moth-eaten Tonto (Johnny Depp in Methuselah makeup) a Wild West carny exhibit. Hes not a very big draw. He recounts his escapades with Kemosabe to a single wide-eyed kid in a Lone Ranger getup. He offers a patchy series of adventures jump-cutting from one would-be high point to the next. The boy interrupts frequently commenting on the old mans unlikely inconsistent version of events. The aim in bouncing between past and present I guess is to distract us from the many scenes that are only sketched in. The big draw of the film is Depp and there are many moments of wit and surprise in his performance. Its remarkable how many laughs he can get out of laconic grunting dialogue and stoic reserve. Hes stronger than the protagonist. The film makes the majestically weird Tonto and the prim city-boy masked lawman into the kind of antagonistic one-upping partners who test each other with every inflection and Tonto never loses. Armie Hammer plays the Ranger a k a John Reid as an accident-prone tenderfoot with just the right tone so that when he does something silly you like him for it. He discovers his inner daredevil after Tonto pronounces him a ""spirit walker"" who cannot be killed in battle. (Why this college-educated rationalist would take a goofball shamans word for a thing like that is not addressed.) John vows revenge when his Texas Ranger brother is killed by the diabolical outlaw Butch Cavendish (the ever-quirky William Fitchner in a long dark coat scraggly whiskers and half an upper lip). Since Tonto has his own score to settle with Butch he joins the search. The film is directed by Gore Verbinski like a landlocked sequel to his ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise. If the gorge-the-eyes-and-rattle-the brain excesses of the later sequels entertained you you may have a good time here. I was swept along for the first hour drinking in the dusty sun-blasted Sergio Leone production design the operatic landscapes and thundering locomotive crack-ups. Then plot overload began to choke the life out of the piece and problems of emotional tone started rotting the foundation. Even Hans Zimmers insistent Ennio Morricone-tinged score cant put the film back on course. Peter Mountain  Disney/Associated Press Johnny Depp left as Tonto and Armie Hammer as the Lone Ranger. Verbinski tries to crowd in ideas from all sorts of westerns from ""Blazing Saddles"" to Peckinpah blood ballets. The old movies hes running in his head dont fit together. What will the kids in the audience make of the scene where a half-dozen riders are shot off their horses one after another by snipers? Or the extended battle scene where U.S. troops (commanded by a Custer-like Barry Pepper) use Gatling guns to cut down hundreds of braves? Verbinski likes his movies packed with colorful characters but gets so involved in their side stories that the main thrust of the story wafts away. Its not enough that Tom Wilkinson as a grasping railroad baron has a wicked scheme He also has intrigues plotted against his own rail company and a romantic interest in John Reids widowed sister-in-law. You could fill a boxcar with this guys motivations and itd all be excess baggage. Helena Bonham Carter hobbles through the piece as a frontier madam with a prosthetic ivory leg that contains a shotgun. Why? For the same reason that the frontier town has a whorehouse with a dance floor the size of a football field as well as a vast traveling freak show that would bankrupt Barnum amp; Bailey. Just because. The later sections of the film are such a succession of hollow blockbuster scenes you wonder how the team worked up the energy to keep going. Even viewing it is arduous William Tell Overdrive. If you could buy a reduced ticket for just the first hour Id recommend it.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 2 2013 Save for later Saved The Lone Ranger stars Johnny Depp (l.) and Armie Hammer (r.). Peter Mountain/Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of When ""The Lone Ranger"" was halted during pre-production in 2011 because Disney thought its 250 million budget was too high the shock waves rocked Hollywood. A Johnny Depp movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer was halted? Can the apocalypse be far behind?Cooler heads prevailed and a budget of 215 million was agreed upon. Now that ""The Lone Ranger"" is a reality all I can say is that they shouldnt have bothered. It may clean up at the box office - to make a profit it better  - but as a slam-bang entertainment its overlong repetitive derivative and essentially wit-free.Depp is Tonto sporting goofy headgear topped by a giant stuffed crow and Armie Hammer is the Lone Ranger a city-educated lawyer who returns to his small Texas hometown in 1869 to civilize the inhabitants and ends up teaming with Tonto to battle the nefarious Cavendish gang after his Ranger brother is killed. Recommended The Lone Ranger 5 other TV shows that became movies Director Gore Verbinski and Bruckheimer both of whom worked with Depp on the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise are clearly trying for another Depp annuity here. Its nice that Tonto isnt relegated to obvious sidekick status as he was in the 1950s TV series but he might as well be since he is given nothing interesting to do. Depp mugs and mutters a lot makes funny little squiggles with his mouth overdoes the double takes and in general acts as if hed rather be somewhere else. He probably knows that if this film is a hit hes locked into yet another silly franchise that will like ""Pirates"" but only more so waste his shape-shifty talents. Just say no. The Lone Ranger 5 other TV shows that became movies Monitor Movie Guide Hammer plays the Lone Ranger as a clueless stolid square and the resulting contrast with Depps cartoonishness isnt odd-couple funny just blah. Meanwhile Verbinski keeps ticking off the movie references ""The Wild Bunch"" ""Little Big Man"" ""The General"" the collected works of John Ford etc. Greatness by association? Hardly.

BOTTOM LINE Overstuffed but thoroughly entertaining with imaginative updates that flip the Wild West on its head. CAST Johnny Depp Armie Hammer William Fichtner Ruth Wilson LENGTH 149 Whats with the mask?"" goes the running joke in ""The Lone Ranger"" a modernized Hollywoodized Johnny Deppified version of the classic Western serial. It winks and mugs and knocks loudly on the fourth wall but this big-budget summer tentpole movie directed by Gore Verbinski also does much more. Its to-do list is ambitious. One Dust off a proto-superhero from the radio-drama days and sell him to the new ""Sherlock Holmes"" crowd. Two Allow Johnny Depp whose flamboyant Jack Sparrow turned Verbinskis ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films into blockbusters to run riot as Tonto a rogue Comanche wearing witch-doctor makeup and a crow on his head. Three Flip manifest destiny on its head by putting the Indian ahead of the cowboy. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""The Lone Ranger"" succeeds on all counts -- perhaps too well. The movie is so imaginative so brimming with ideas that it cant quite decide what to be. (Two ""Pirates"" veterans co-wrote the script.) Its a rollicking action-adventure with locomotives rooftop shootouts and a bright-white Silver who has the powers of Pegasus. Its also a Sergio Leone epic with railroad baron Latham Cole (an excellent Tom Wilkinson) wiping out the natives with help from henchman Butch Cavendish (a deliciously greasy William Fichtner). Some bawdy humor comes from Helena Bonham Carter as a madam with an ivory leg. But the whole tableau is mournfully framed by an elderly Tonto telling his tale to a wide-eyed child. (Its a nod to Arthur Penns ""Little Big Man"" and an excuse for Depp to wear yet another elaborate makeup job.) 137 MoviesThe Lone Ranger trailer I havent even mentioned John Reid the movies title role. Played by a toothy Armie Hammer hes an idealistic lawyer who must wise up to harsh reality before he can properly wear the mask. Hammer and Depp make a likable team but Tonto is the movies hero. Time and again his brains and brawn help Reid -- also known as ""stupid white man"" -- cut the dashing figure he is destined to become. advertisement | advertise on newsday Verbinskis animated ""Rango"" another hugely enjoyable but overstuffed Western (also with Depp as the voice of a lizard) now seems like the storyboards for ""The Lone Ranger."" Where the whole movie is headed seems unclear but its certainly a thrilling ride. PLOT In 1869 an idealistic American lawyer becomes a masked vigilante. RATING PG-13 CAST Johnny Depp Armie Hammer William Fichtner Ruth Wilson LENGTH 149 BOTTOM LINE Overstuffed but thoroughly entertaining with imaginative updates that flip the Wild West on its head.

"The Lone Ranger Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Lone Ranger Western is completely at sea A hero of radio and TV is lost in a misfire by the Pirates teamJuly 03 2013|Michael Phillips (Peter Mountain HANDOUT)Not that Johnny Depp did them for free but Disney Enterprises Inc. owes Depp and his mock-heroic portrayal of the knave Jack Sparrow a great deal for the financial success of the four ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" pictures. You know how it is with four hits Theres always the threat of a fifth. Meanwhile Disney producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski have moved on to another quarter-billion-dollar gamble.This time Depp takes on the most famous yet most marginalized sidekick in 20th-century popular culture the Native American known in his early radio days as ""the faithful Indian companion"" to ""the daring and resourceful masked rider of the plains."" Disneys ""The Lone Ranger"" allows the stoic second banana enough screen time and narrative elbow room so that the movie really shouldve been called ""Tontos Revenge"" or ""Tonto Steps Up 2 the Saddle"" or given the movies perspective on the titular hero ""Tonto and the Dweeb."" In marketing terms it behooves Disney to draw as many parallels as possible between the ""Pirates"" franchise and this new open-air adventure. Well theres this While nominally a Western ""The Lone Ranger"" is completely at sea.How/why/wherefore did it turn out this way?The evidence suggests a combination of hubris errant revisionism a misguided and perverse degree of violence and a script that never worked in the first place the second draft or in any of the rewrites. Is it too late to shut down production on a summer picture thats already in theaters?The framing device established by that script credited to Justin Haythe and the team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio promises at least a workable approach. In 1933 San Francisco an ancient Native American (Depp borrowing Dustin Hoffmans old-man makeup from ""Little Big Man"") works as part of a dusty old sideshow posing lifelessly (we think its a dummy at first) as ""The Noble Savage."" Then he fixes his gaze on a wide-eyed preteen in a cowboy outfit and the boy learns the truth of Tontos decades-old story of how he came to partner with the Texas Ranger turned stone-cold seeker of Old Testament revenge.Lawman John Reid the square-jawed Eastern-educated masked man played by Armie Hammer (""The Social Network"" ""J. Edgar"") is only slightly more comfortable in Verbinskis venal Old West than Bob Hope was in the ""Paleface"" comedies. But this is no comedy or rather the attempts at muttered wisecracks (""Whats with the mask?"" queries a wise old native chief) and elaborate Buster Keaton-inspired stunt work sit uneasily alongside scarifying attack rabbits or minor characters (such as Stephen Roots railroad man) getting shot in the back and screaming in pain while someone makes a speech. Most egregiously we have the psychopathic outlaw Butch Cavendish played by William Fichtner who doesnt merely shoot and kill Reids Ranger brother; he cuts out his heart and eats it. Uh fellas? Who the hi-yo Silver is this movie for?As in the animated ""Rango"" which Verbinski also directed ""The Lone Ranger"" has ambitions toward a vision of the American West that tells the truth (a version of it anyway) about the genocidal slaughter dirty dealings and cynicism-inducing dread involved in the ""settling."" (""Rango"" owed as much to the story line of ""Chinatown"" as it did to ""Cat Ballou."") As the elder Tonto delves into the first flashback we meet the Lone Ranger and the younger Tonto in the middle of a bank robbery. The movie then lurches on from one enormous inert action sequence to another to answer the question How did the Lone Ranger become a bank robber and why?Faced with a force of evil as bad as Cavendish and the motivations of those behind the transcontinental railroad (Tom Wilkinson adds a touch of gravity as the empire builder) Reid has no choice but to bury his upright law-abiding ways and go rogue with his frenemy Tonto. Bonham Carter shows up as a one-legged madam whose replacement leg perversely hides a double-barreled shotgun. Ruth Wilson plays the widow of Reids brother who attracts the attention of Wilkinsons railroad magnate. Barry Pepper cuts a sharp Custer-like figure as a captain drawn into an Indian war that is not what it seems. With the exception of Hammer who never seems to lose his parodic edge the actors are not the problem.

Goin Somewhere? Credit Walt Disney Pictures From The Lone Ranger - Derailed Derailed Credit Walt Disney Pictures Theres never been anything very lone about the Lone Ranger. Hes always been accompanied by Tonto his Native American sidekick; Silver his snow-white steed; and the William Tell Overture. And in the big-screen version out this Wednesday from Johnny Depp and director Gore Verbinski hes also trailed by a wagon trains worth of classic-movie references Monument Valley settings straight out of John Ford Westerns steam-locomotive stunts cribbed from Buster Keatons The General a one-legged madam whod seem Alice in Wonderland-ish even if she werent being played by Helena Bonham Carter. There are even antagonist-buddy routines for the lawman Ranger and the outlaw Indian that might have been lifted straight out of Laurel and Hardy. Armie Hammer plays the titular Ranger -- well Ranger-to-be when the film gets underway -- as a noble do-gooder fresh out of law school while Johnny Depps Tonto is a face-painting ""noble savage"" (thats the movies phrase) whos forever feeding the dead crow he wears on his head. Theyll bond but not until the movie introduces Silver -- a spirit horse who arrives to lift the rangers soul literally from the grave. Think of this films early going as an origin-story version of The Lone Ranger in which we even get a backstory for the mask. That and some major shifts in tone. i If Johnny Depps in the film can Helena Bonham Carter (and a bustier) be far behind? In this Ranger she plays Red the madam of a Texas brothel who offers aid and comfort to Tonto and his masked companion. Peter Mountain/Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Peter Mountain/Walt Disney Pictures If Johnny Depps in the film can Helena Bonham Carter (and a bustier) be far behind? In this Ranger she plays Red the madam of a Texas brothel who offers aid and comfort to Tonto and his masked companion. Peter Mountain/Walt Disney Pictures Audiences expecting a Pirates of the Panhandle from Verbinski -- who paired with Depp on that swashbuckling franchise as well as on the ingeniously eccentric animated Western Rango -- are in for some serious dry stretches. The directors been saying his Lone Ranger is a sort of Don Quixote as seen through the eyes of a demented Sancho Panza and as with that tale of a knight tilting at windmills theres social commentary everywhere you look in this adventure. The script fancies itself a critique of capitalism a manifesto on manifest destiny and a saga about silver mines and the slaughter of Native Americans. All very admirable if not a great fit for scenes that involve Depp communing with snaggle-toothed cannibal bunny rabbits and taking a runaway train ride or six. I mentioned Buster Keatons train movie The General earlier but when Keaton did stunts -- playing pickup sticks with railway ties to clear the track in front of a moving locomotive say -- he actually did the stunts. The ties had weight. Here the director laid six miles of track in New Mexico and built two locomotives -- built the locomotives I said reportedly for authenticitys sake -- so he could do things with real trains. But hes digitally enhanced and implausibly staged those sequences so thoroughly that he might as well have done the whole thing as a cartoon. Theres a couple of hundred million dollars worth of technical wizardry up there on screen and nothing is at stake. Except maybe for some future amusement park ride and the sequels and toys and hats and masks. And piles and piles of silver if enough people lay down their hard-earned dollars to hear Hammers hearty ""Hi-yo.""

""The Lone Ranger"" Gore Verbinskis bloated 250 million western comedy is like watching an elephant tap dance in your living room Everything gets trampled and the dancings not very good. Armie Hammer plays a bumbling tenderfoot of a Lone Ranger an Eastern-educated lawyer who unwillingly puts on the mask when bad guys (led by William Fichtner and Tom Wilkinson) threaten his loved ones. Johnny Depp ill-advisedly plays Tonto The character has been rewritten as the heros shrewd cynical sidekick but mostly Depp grimaces and shoots off one-liners in Injun-speak. Hes Jack Sparrow on downers in red-face.

Depp who worked with Verbinski on the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies plays Tonto the Lone Rangers faithful Native American companion on the old radio serial and television series. The traditional depiction of Tonto as a sort of noble savage would have been impossible today. Instead Verbinski working from a script credited to Justin Haythe Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio puts Tonto front and center. An odd framing device has Tonto in the 1930s recalling the creation of the Lone Ranger in the Old West for a boy at a fair. John Reid (Armie Hammer) is a straight-laced by-the-book law-school graduate who comes back to the small Western town where he grew up. His older brother Dan (James Badge Dale) is a Texas Ranger married with a son. But things are in transition. The railroad is about to link the country and change the West forever. Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) is the ambitious railroad man who sees the future and is adamant about chasing it. As a symbol of law and order taming the region hes arranged for the public hanging of Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) the kind of outlaw who represents the old guard. All that has to happen is for Cavendish to be delivered by railroad to the town for his execution. Uh-oh. If you know the Lone Ranger story you know what happens next. Tragedy leads to the pairing of John Reid and Tonto as the film dips into mismatched-partner mode. Tonto wants revenge Reid wants justice. But they both want Cavendish. This makes more sense in the description than it does on the screen. Several subplots do little but take up time leading us away from the main narrative. Some of these distractions are meant to be funny others are surprisingly violent particularly from a Disney film. Together they create a jumbled mess. But from a story standpoint the weirdest choice was to build the film around Tonto. Its understandable from a business standpoint Disney and Verbinski have made a mint off of Depps work in the ""Pirates"" franchise. And even when he is going way over the top which seems to be what he does lately Depp is always fun to watch. The problem is that he steps all over Hammer who is a more-than-capable actor (he was the best thing about ""J. Edgar"" and a lot of fun in ""Mirror Mirror"") but not nearly as magnetic as Depp. Yet the name of the film is ""The Long Ranger"" not ""Tonto."" There is a push and pull for not just our attention but for the heart of the film. Then there is the finale a two-train action sequence that gets bigger and bigger (and concurrently less and less realistic) as it goes on. And on. And on. Bigger is not always better and ""The Lone Ranger"" is a prime example of this. Making this movie from Tontos perspective is an intriguing idea. Its too bad its execution gets so muddled along the way. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

(Peter Mountain/Disney) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday July 2 2013 246 AM Title The Lone Ranger Film Info With Johnny Depp Armie Hammer Helena Bonham Carter. A Native American warrior and a renegade Texas Ranger fight villainous Butch Cavendish. Director Gore Verbinski (229). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. Opens Tuesday night. Director Gore Verbinskis ""The Lone Ranger"" is for anyone who thought the Native American guy from the Village People and a western-wear model would make the perfect blockbuster-action team. This smart-looking but empty adventure -- with a hero that looks more Tom Ford than John Ford -- suffers from a shambling script shifting tones and a surplus of villains. Clunky and drawn out ""Ranger"" shoots blanks even with the star power of Johnny Depp behind it. Johnny Depp is the first Caucasian actor to play Tonto. He dismissed controversy over the casting by citing his own Native American heritage. (Disney Enterprises Inc./ Jerry Bruckheimer Inc.) The movies one true twist is to tell the tale originated on radio 70 years ago from the point of view of Tonto (Depp) first glimpsed in 1933 as a nearly 100-year-old sideshow denizen. The scale of the train action scenes is impressive but they often dont make sense. (Peter Mountain/Disney) The proud Comanche recounts his exploits in 1869 when he met an upright Texas lawyer named John Reid (likable but bland Armie Hammer). Tonto makes the iconic mask for Reid after helping him recover from a brush with death. (Peter Mountain) Reid and Tonto are at odds when they meet but when Reid is left for dead after he and his brothers Texas Ranger troupe are ambushed the face-painted man with the lifeless black bird on his head helps him recover. Reids alliance with Tonto gradually sees him change from a lawman to a masked vigilante. (Film Frame) Saying that his spirit came back from the dead Tonto fashions a mask for Reid to wear capping off a natty outfit of suit white hat and red scarf. Reid takes on the Lone Ranger identity as he seeks out the people responsible for his brothers death. (Peter Mountain) Together they set out to stop baddie Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and the corporate fiends whose greed puts its odd-couple protagonists in harms way time and again. The movie looks good but has a weak script too many villains and an overlong running time. (Peter Mountain/ Disney) Not quite a parody but broader than an homage ""The Lone Ranger"" fights itself at every turn. Verbinski who with Depp did three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" adventures as well as the animated ""Rango"" has energy to spare but a restless spirit. The massive mostly non-CGI train sequences that bookend the movie lack internal logic with the final one losing track of where its heroes are as they scramble atop steam engines filled with loot and explosives. The use of the signature ""William Tell Overture"" here tilts it all from tribute to sendup. Depp -- the first Caucasian performer to play Tonto -- will likely be brushed off and targeted for playing a Native American though he and Verbinski get away with it by keeping the mood cartoonish. And what Depp does just with his eyes is slyly subversive somehow cutting off criticism at the pass. But as the overlong dull ""Lone Ranger"" goes over a bridge Tontos reinvention as wily warrior is the least of its worries. When Helena Bonham Carter in her now-requisite bustier shows up with a gun in her fake leg things get full-bore ""Wild Wild West."" The movie may not be a silver bullet into the heart of its iconic characters but its sure not going to fly. On a mobile device?

Theres the Lone Ranger being dragged through equine manure. Theres a scene where our hero literally tries to beat a dead horse. And then you have a train plunging off a dynamited bridge into a ravine at the climax which feels like four hours after the movie itself has gone off the rails. RELATED HOW DEPP NEARLY DIED MAKING LONE RANGER Imagine ""Heavens Gate as a family film with half the laughs and none of the visual grandeur. John Ford would have director Gore Verbinski strung up if he could see the atrocities hes committed in Fords beloved Monument Valley. The director of ""The Searchers would be appalled at a committee-written script that simultaneously tries to send up the western genre while trying to play it straight -- and throws in a couple of PG-13-rated Indian massacres strictly as devices to move along a convoluted plot that stubbornly refuses to cohere. Depp certainly tries every schtick in the book as Tonto first introduced in ""Little Big Man makeup as a Wild West Show attraction in 1933 San Francisco relates the Lone Rangers lumbering origin story from way back in 1869. Hammers John Reid newly arrived as territorial prosecutor is deputized as a Texas Ranger by his older brother (James Badge Dale) to hunt down outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichter a good actor but no comedian) who ends up slaughtering all of the search party -- and cutting out the brothers heart. RELATED LONE RANGER FASHION GETS AN UPGRADE IN THE NEW FLICK John presumed dead by Butch is found and revived by Tonto an aphorism machine who is always saying things like ""justice is what a man must take for himself. Tonto -- who first meets the future Lone Ranger on a train where hes being held captive with Butch -- has his own reason to want vengeance against Butch though its not really worth the hours wait to find out the particulars. Depp attempts to invest Tonto with some sort of crackpot dignity but he saves John so often he comes dangerously close to a Native American version of what Spike Lee calls the Magical Negro a character whose raison detre is helping a white character even if he keeps calling him stupid. RELATED SIDEKICK TAKES CENTER SADDLE IN JOHNNY DEPPS LONE RANGER At least Depp gets a few laughs but vastly fewer than in the far livelier ""Pirates of the Caribbean which Verbinski also directed. (The two also collaborated on the animated western spoof ""Rango which has more wit in any random five minutes than in the whole of ""The Lone Ranger.) Poor Hammer plays John Reid mostly as a masked bumbler up until the very end when he turns into the Lone Ranger as Rossinis ""William Tell Overture swells on the soundtrack. Its too little too late. ""The Lone Ranger pours on untold Disney millions in special effects and stunt work in what blurs into one long visual non sequitur that tries to bludgeon you into submission. By the time the movie careened into its third hour I was begging for mercy. ""How could this be worse? John Reid asks at one point a sentiment that will no doubt be shared by millions of moviegoers around the world. Well I guess it could have been in 3-D and run half an hour longer but that would have violated the Geneva Convention.

The story begins needlessly in 1933 -- the year that The Lone Ranger originally hit the airwaves -- as a young boy in San Francisco encounters a decrepit Tonto (Depp) as part of a travelling sideshow. The boys Ranger-aping attire prompts Tonto to recollect their original adventures together decades earlier as the Native American outcast and left-for-dead lawyer John Reid (Armie Hammer) reluctantly teamed up to avenge their families each having been ruthlessly slain by cannibalistic fiend Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner suitably dastardly) and his band of outlaws. That sounds simple enough right? A 149-minute running time bloated with flashbacks flash-forwards and non-surprises galore says otherwise although why should one expect anything less between director Gore Verbinski co-writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and producer Jerry Bruckheimer? Being veterans of the two most recent ""Zorro"" films Elliott and Rossio should have known to keep the action treachery and romance plain and simple; after four ""Pirates"" films its little wonder that they couldnt manage that. Justin Haythe was brought in to rewrite their script reportedly pruning down costly supernatural elements and yet still leaving room for a scorpion attack a brothel visit (accounting for half of Helena Bonham Carters two scenes as a one-legged madam) belching horses pooping horses sporadic commentary on the damnable reach of the White Man (epitomized by railroad magnate Tom Wilkinson) into a new frontier and so much lip service regarding the true nature of justice. In the middle stretch between the films admittedly cracking train-set bookends we get plenty of Depps quirky schtick as he feeds a dead bird atop his head and makes backhanded remarks in broken English (shades of 2011s update of ""The Green Hornet""). Were treated to more of Tontos tragic backstory than we are of Johns despite his seemingly contentious return to his hometown following years of law education back east. His brother (James Badge Dale) is a Texas Ranger who sees little need for due process; his brothers wife (Ruth Wilson) clearly used to have a thing for John but she and her boy (Bryant Prince) are little more than two-for-one damsels to be later distressed. Once the first act sets up these relationships the Lone Ranger is only ever a larger presence than Tonto in his own film thanks to Hammers towering height more than his proven charms. Otherwise its back to our questionably reliable narrator a Jack Sparrow once again thrust from serving the role of priceless sidekick to becoming a listless leading man prattling on about how ""nature is out of balance"" and trading in the same half-dozen sub-routines of deadpan wackiness. Those worried about the potential offensiveness of Depps performance should know that genuine Native American characters are eventually introduced to serve two purposes to distance Tontos off-kilter ways from their own tribe and to then be mowed down in a pointless hail of second-act gunfire. Similar acts of violence taint the would-be lightness of it all workers are yanked down from power poles by passing trains which soon crash despite cars shown to be filled with passengers while henchmens heads are handily crushed without so much as a smidge of blood shown. (Way to still land a PG-13 Disney Take that snaggle-toothed cross-dressers) But hey hearts arent going to cut themselves out of chest cavities to be swallowed whole. Sadly such disingenuous touches are par for the remaining course. Verbinski treats the first act with relative gravity playing up the striking vistas of the American Southwest and generally distancing himself from the computer-generated hullabaloo that had dominated his three ""Pirates"" pictures and this films opening sequence. Theres at least one shot of the Reid Brothers and company framed against a particularly ominous pass that suggests a classical fondness for Westerns one not beholden to the oddball prism of Verbinski and Depps last collaboration ""Rango"" and briefly beautiful in its own right and even when the climactic chase between two criss-crossing trains has all the gravity of a toy train run off the rails not long before this action sequence finally comes closest to capturing the freewheeling spirit of that Oscar-winning animated effort. Until then Depp prances about while the expected white men gradually reveal their greedy schemes (although enough about Jerry Bruckheimer...). By the time the William Tell Overture finally kicks in for the big finale its not just a welcome callback to the Rangers original cultural legacy but a respite from composer Hans Zimmers relentless recycling of his own ""Pirates"" and ""Sherlock Holmes"" scores. Then the movie ends and ends and ends with the promise (threat?) of further adventures to come. At their best ""Caribbean"" and ""Rango"" represented the ideal outcome of a costly creative collaboration lively and lithe despite their blockbuster burdens. ""The Lone Ranger"" isnt that. Its the end result of a calculated brand -- two and a half hours of ""fun"" in air quotes.

In ""The Lone Ranger"" Gore Verbinskis flamboyant re-imagination of the hokey long-running radio show and 50s cowboy TV series Depp eagerly attempts to recreate the extravagant magic of his similarly farcical Jack Sparrow of Verbinskis ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" With cracked white and black streaks down his face and a dead crow atop his head Depps Tonto (whose look makeup artist Joel Harlow took from the Kirby Sattler painting ""I Am Crow"") appears more witch doctor than warrior. One would think that a so-costumed Depp careening through the Old West with Buster Keaton aplomb would make ""The Lone Ranger"" at worst entertaining. But Verbinskis film stretching hard to both reinvent an out-of-date brand and breathe new life in the Western with a desperate onslaught of bloated set pieces is a poor locomotive for Depps eccentric theatrics. For 2 1/2 hours the Jerry Bruckheimer-produced ""Lone Ranger"" inflates subverts and distorts the conventions of the Western until in an interminable climax the big-budget spectacle finally exhaustingly collapses in a scrap heap of train wreckage. ""The Long Ranger"" is alas a runaway train. A filmmaker of great excess Verbinskis ricocheting whimsy here runs off the rails. Flashback-heavy plot mechanics occasionally grim violence (bullets land in bodies with the loudest of thwacks a heart gets eaten) and surrealistic comedy add up to a confused tone that seems uncertain exactly how to position Depps Tonto in the movie to say nothing of Armie Hammers wayward Lone Ranger. The film begins with an elderly leathery Tonto (also Depp nearly unrecognizable) at a 1933 San Francisco fair where under a sign labeled ""noble savage"" the old Native American regales a young masked Lone Ranger fan (Mason Cook) about his adventures with John Reid (Hammer). Previously the sidekick Tonto plays the starring role in the story narrating a tall tale of his coming together with Reid a district attorney who arrives in the frontier town of Colby Texas with high ideals of justice and a copy of John Lockes ""Treatise on Government"" under his arm. The lawman is made a Texas Ranger when the criminal Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner ashen and sinister) escapes. The pursuit takes on urgency when Cavendish massacres the rest of the Rangers (including Reids brother played by James Badge Dale) leaving Reid and Tonto to navigate a familiar mid-19th century Old West -- the coming railroad mining development and Indian warfare -- with familiar types like the intrepid tycoon Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) and a one-legged madam (Helena Bonham Carter). Stepping into Clayton Moores boots the tall baritone Hammer never looks at ease. While he exudes the Lone Rangers earnest wholesomeness hes understandably an uncertain straight man alongside Depps slapstick. Having to wear a white Stetson and mask in his first starring role feels like yet another humiliation for the Winklevoss twins Hammer memorably played in ""The Social Network."" The most laudable aspect of ""The Lone Ranger"" is that it attempts to dispel and mock Hollywoods past Native American ills. Depp who has claimed he has some Cherokee ancestry delights in upending false images of Indian mysticism all the while tossing bird seed to the dead crow on his head. But ""The Lone Ranger"" which was made with much of the ""Pirates"" team including screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio along with ""Revolutionary Road"" adapter Justin Haythe can only be filed alongside ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and ""Wild Wild West"" as ornate films that are so nervous about the modern appeal of the Western that they ruin it by impulsively overstuffing it. The Coen brothers ""True Grit"" and the 2007 remake of ""310 to Yuma"" better understood the genres inherent terseness. When Verbinski was last directing and Depp was a cartoon lizard they crafted a far better Western in ""Rango."" ""The Lone Ranger"" a Walt Disney release is rated PG-13 for sequences of intense action and violence and some suggestive material. Running time 149 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.

Railroad companies and military types prove corrupt. The titular character is staunchly anti-gun. Greed renders Tonto a Comanche without a tribe.Johnny Depp left as Tonto a spirit warrior on a personal quest joins forces in a fight for justice with Armie Hammer as John Reid a lawman who has become a masked avenger The Lone Ranger in The Lone Ranger.(Photo Peter Mountain Disney/Bruckheimer Films)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Armie Hammer Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter Tom Wilkinson William FichtnerRated PG-13; runtime 2 hours 29 minutes; opens limited Tuesday night and nationwide on WednesdayThe Lone Ranger might as well be Pirates of the Caribbean run aground in the dusty wild west.Director Gore Verbinski has choreographed a movie ( out of four; rated PG-13; opening Tuesday night in some theaters and Wednesday nationwide) too similar in style and energy to his high-seas franchise films. The likeness is intensified by Johnny Depps turn as Tonto who seems related to Jack Sparrow at least in the smirking comic relief department.Thats not to say Depp isnt good in the role -- hes the best thing about the movie. But its a 21/2-hour slog with tonal inconsistencies and monotonous drawn-out action sequences. Scenes alternate between frenetic and tedious.PREMIERE Johnny Depp rules over The Lone RangerSNEAK PEEK The Lone Ranger and Tonto ride againVIDEO Johnny Depp nearly gets trampled by horseArmie Hammer plays the legendary hero as the alter ego of lawman John Reid. In his spotless white hat he cuts a dashing figure. But its a mystery why Verbinski makes the audience wait more than 2 hours for the money shot and signature tune. When the masked fighter of injustice finally gallops triumphantly on his white stallion to the blaring strains of William Tells overture it feels long overdue.By this point the audience has had to endure a bloated tale of bad guys robbing shooting and blowing up trains and good guys trying to fend them off and forestall disaster.The movies framing device kicks in early and often.A boy wanders into a traveling carnival exhibition in 1933 and encounters a desert tableau with a sign that reads ""The Noble Savage."" What appears to be a statue of an aged Native American comes to life before the incredulous lads eyes. The elderly fellow recounts a yarn of derring-do set 60 years previously. The storyteller is none other than the all-but-forgotten octogenarian Tonto played poignantly by Depp underneath effectively rendered makeup.But then it cuts to the convoluted overstuffed adventure. Prosecutor John Reid meets Tonto when theyre shackled together on a train by gun-slinging villains. This yoking leads to an intricately choreographed escape and sets up an expectation for rollicking fun. But their ensuing escapades never come off as entertaining as that initial go-round.Too much is thrown at the audience. A couple of villains do their darnedest to amp up the tension. Theres the deformed outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) then the slicker Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) a railroad executive with megalomaniacal intentions. Along the way the pair stop at a house of ill repute and meet Helena Bonham Carter as a ginger-haired madam packing heat in a wooden leg.With his clean-cut good looks Hammer is appealing as Reid/Lone Ranger. Avowedly anti-gun he proclaims the law as his religion. Reid becomes the reluctant sole ranger after his ranger brother Dan (James Badge Dale) and a team of other law enforcers are killed by Cavendish. Reids dreams of due process must be set aside.The movies titular character is second fiddle to Depps slyly clever Tonto in this reboot. That would seem a reasonable storytelling device but their bond never feels fully developed. Its as if their sense of loyalty is modified for a contemporary self-centered era.Geographic and historical details are glossed over. The distinctive rocky Utah desert landscape subs in for Texas and the Lone Ranger actually utters the modern over-used action phrase ""Lets do this."" Was that necessary?The Lone Ranger is a boisterous relentless production long on action but short on fun. 100 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 22 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/11UueGJSummer Movies Calendar JulyTake a look at the films heading to the box office this July complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

But theyre also about beautiful men charismatic sometimes dangerous-looking demigods like Robert Ryan James Stewart Franco Nero Randolph Scott and of course John Wayne. The Lone Ranger has Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp the former a long-legged Adonis whose polite deportment puts him in the sweet spot between corn-fed and aristocratic the latter a dazzling rascal with cheekbones that rival Gene Tierneys. Theres something else The Lone Ranger has going for it too Instead of using CGI to create a believably authentic Old West setting it was shot in the actual West. The locations include Monument Valley the backdrop for 1001 beloved westerns a rugged red-and-gray vista that should be considered a visual clichZe but instead looks comfortingly familiar -- like home but with rocks. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - How much do you think The Lone Rangers director Gore Verbinski appreciates any of this God-given beauty? Judging by the amount of crap he packs around it -- dozens of superfluous plot points action sequences so cluttered they obscure whatever genius may lurk within heaps of heavy-duty symbolism that ultimately mean nothing and juvenile gags that appear to have been written by 10-year-olds rather than for them -- not much. The Lone Ranger has it all but what you end up with is not much. Its an extravagantly squandered opportunity.Youd think or at least hope that a movie based on a 30s radio show -- and later a hugely popular TV series -- would preserve some sense of lightness some proof that it isnt taking itself too seriously. But even though The Lone Ranger in the manner of Verbinskis Pirates of the Caribbean movies overflows with spoofiness (Helena Bonham Carter as a madam with a loaded-for-bear ivory leg) its determination to wow is the grim kind. The movie is also overanxious not to offend Verbinski uses a framing device to assert repeatedly that his movie is actually sympathetic to Native Americans and not just taking advantage of stereotypes. He clearly doesnt trust his audience to get his point of view; worse yet he has to keep showing us how much he doesnt trust us.Film Details The Lone Ranger RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time149 More Info Trailer So between reminders of all the atrocities committed by white men were supposed to laugh and have fun. Thats an uneasy fit and Verbinski cant pull it off. Besides all that the plot is extremely simple in its overcomplexity Before Hammers Lone Ranger becomes the Lone Ranger hes a to-the-letter lawman named John Reid who believes in bringing men to justice by trying them in court. His brother Dan (James Badge Dale) on the other hand is a Texas Ranger who knows that sometimes you just have to use a gun. Meanwhile a captured lawbreaker with criminally bad teeth (played by William Fichtner) escapes. Also a seemingly benevolent railroad tycoon played by Tom Wilkinson might not be as benevolent as we think because hes (a) a railroad tycoon and (b) played by Tom Wilkinson.Did I mention that John has long been in love with his brothers wife (Ruth Wilson)? And that he eventually joins forces with a Comanche named Tonto? That would be Depp in white clay makeup streaked with tears of black to signify the Great Sadness he carries within him. Once John finally reluctantly dons that black mask and becomes the Lone Ranger he and Tonto perform assorted feats of derring-do In one of the best the Lone Rangers silvery-white horse -- so famous we dont even need to mention his name -- leaps atop a burning house. Its one of the few moments in The Lone Ranger that has any real grandeur. Theres also a massive elaborate finale involving a train which at least gives Depp the chance to again channel Buster Keaton as he did in Benny amp; Joon. But even though Depp might have given The Lone Ranger some soul hes completely lost in it. The picture doesnt challenge him; in fact it barely needs him -- its so top-heavy with ostentatious yet weirdly unaffecting action sequences that hes rendered superfluous. Similarly Hammer might have given The Lone Ranger some sex appeal but Verbinski and cinematographer Bojan Bazelli waste him too Hes dashing in that skimpy leather mask and absurd white hat but theres so much swirling around him that his face barely matters.It doesnt help that Hammer is saddled with the dudliest of the movies dud dialogue spouting a lot of nonsense about how a civilized society doesnt need a masked man. Of course it does At least in movies based on comic books and old TV serials. Hammer a real stretch of a guy does look great on that horse as does his stunt double -- in fact anytime Silver is onscreen the movie springs to life. That horse -- actually of course played by several horses -- is the one figure in The Lone Ranger whos in touch with the natural landscape around him. Hes the one beautiful guy Verbinski doesnt let down.Follow VoiceFilmClub2 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Review The Lone Ranger one hot mess - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview The Lone Ranger one hot messBy Charlie McCollumcmccollummercurynews.comPosted 07/01/2013 123849 PM PDTUpdated 07/02/2013 015046 PM PDTRelated StoriesJul 6Armie Hammer tries on the mask of an unironic icon in The Lone RangerJul 2Johnny Depp at 50 Just happy to still be around""The Lone Ranger"" is way too long incoherent at times loaded with clumsy dialogue and less than sure-footed in its tone.Thats the bad news.But heres the thing about the film despite all its not-inconsiderable failings its surprisingly entertaining for its two and a half-hour running time. Every time it threatens to go completely off the rails theres a spectacular action sequence or more often a dazzling bit of business from Johnny Depp as Tonto that pulls you back into the film. With all its tonal shifts and florid execution its more than a bit like the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" which also starred Depp and was also directed by Gore Verbinski.""The Lone Ranger"" is the latest retelling of the legend of a masked man who brought justice to the Old West in ""those thrilling days of yesteryear."" Originally a 1930s radio series the story earned a place in American mythology as a hit television show that ran from 1949 to 1957 with Clayton Moore as the ranger and Jay Silverheels as Tonto. People who grew up in that era can still recall the shows theme music (the ""William Tell Overture"") and such catchphrases as ""Hi-Yo Silver Away""While much of the ""Lone Ranger"" back story is present in fragments Verbinski and writers Justin Haythe Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (all ""Pirates"" veterans) chose to open the film in 1933 San Francisco with an ancient Tonto as part of a low-rent Wild West carnival exhibit. He gets into a conversation with a kid in a cowboy outfit about his adventures with Kemosabe with recollections that prove as inconsistent as the movie itself.Advertisement In his version of the tale Tonto is a crafty warrior/shaman while John Reid (Armie Hammer of ""The Social Network"") aka the Lone Ranger is a citified lawyer returning to his hometown of Colby Texas to be the new local prosecutor. His older brother Dan (James Badge Dale) is the Texas Ranger captain assigned to pick up a real bad outlaw named Butch Cavendish (the always-quirky William Fichtner) who is being brought to Colby by train to meet his maker for his crimes. Also on the train the homecoming John Reid and Tonto who is under arrest for ""being an Indian.""This is all happening against the backdrop of the building of the Transcontinental Railroad overseen by railway boss Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) who has his eye on Dans wife Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) with all kinds of nefarious plans.As you might expect the train never reaches Colby. Instead Cavendishs gang springs him triggering the first of several elaborate train wrecks that dot the movie. That triggers a chase with John Reid joining his brother and the rangers in a hunt for Cavendish and his men. There is a bloody ambush with all but John Reid ending up dead. Dan Reids death is particularly ugly.But the lawyer is rescued not by Tonto but by Silver who in this version is a spirit horse with some amusing eccentricities. Tonto becomes convinced Reid is a ""spirit warrior"" who cannot be killed. Thus the Lone Ranger legend is born and -- after another 90 minutes and numerous battles and chase scenes -- justice will prevail.Verbinski clearly had in mind a film that would shift easily between humor and action. Instead hes created a pastiche that careens erratically through references to the original TV show John Fords classic tales of the West (the scenery is gorgeous) Sergio Leones spaghetti Westerns and the revisionist works of Sam Peckinpah. Heck there are even borrowed bits from ""Back to the Future 3"" (which was partly set in the Old West) and ""The Last Samurai."" Johnny Depp as Tonto and Armie Hammer as ""The Lone Ranger"" (Peter Mountain/Disney) They may not be original but Verbinski sure knows how to stage an individual scene -- even while he proves incapable of stringing them together in a coherent fashion. Using CGI some mechanical horses and good old-fashioned stunt work the set pieces are often real grabbers.And then theres Depp who manages to be witty and surprising as Tonto even if other aspects of the movie are falling apart around him. The other performances are at best serviceable with Hammer Fichtner and Wilson (a BBC-TV actress who deserves a better role next time) faring the best. (Despite her prominence in the films trailer and posters Helena Bonham Carters role as a saloon madam is no more than a glorified cameo.)In the end ""The Lone Ranger"" is one hot mess -- an entertaining one to be sure but still a mess.For film news and more follow Charlie McCollum at Twitter.com/charlie_mccollu.THE LONE RANGER   1/2Rating PG-13 (for intense action violence and some suggestive material).Cast Johnny Depp Armie Hammer William Fitchner and Tom WilkinsonDirector Gore VerbinskiRunning time 2 hours 29 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

This attempt for another ""Pirates of the Caribbean""-scaled series tries to have it too many ways tonally resulting in a work that wobbles and thrashes all over the place. TWITTER Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer star in a revisionist adventure with franchise and theme park intentions written all over it. After proving himself a crack shot on his first pranky Western the animated Rango Gore Verbinski appears not to have had enough ammo left over to score as well with The Lone Ranger a moderately amusing but very uneven revisionist adventure with franchise and theme park intentions written all over it. Floated conceptually and commercially by another eccentric comic characterization by Johnny Depp this attempt by Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer to plant the flag for another Pirates of the Caribbean-scaled series tries to have it too many ways tonally resulting in a work that wobbles and thrashes all over the place as it attempts to find the right groove. Theres enough entertainment value in this vastly overlong extravaganza to put it over commercially although whether it can reach Pirates levels of profitability and warrant three sequels is another matter. STORY Who is That Masked Man? 6 Things to Know About the Lone Ranger Without Depps willingness to trade in Captain Jack Sparrows eyeliner and bejeweled dreadlocks for Tontos cracked white face paint and dead crow headgear no one would have been remotely interested in reviving this vintage radio standby which clocked 2956 episodes between 1933 and 1954 and boomer TV favorite which ran from 1949 to 1957 and also spawned two feature films. A previous try at a big-screen origins story The Legend of the Lone Ranger in 1981 was a total bust and the only film ever made by the actor who played the title character Klinton Spilsbury. PHOTOS Lone Ranger Premiere Brings Johnny Depp Armie Hammer and the Wild West to Disneyland The title notwithstanding the scenario for the new film concocted by the Pirates team of Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio along with Justin Haythe focuses principally upon Tonto (the Spanish meaning of which is joked about). No doubt cribbing from Arthur Penns Little Big Man (1970) the yarn spun here is related by the surviving centenarian ""noble savage"" to a white boy in cowboy gear (mask included) in a San Francisco carnival tent in 1933 (nice backdrop here of the Golden Gate Bridge under construction even if the project wasnt as far along at this point in time). Looking more like a mummified Christopher Walken than like Depp himself Tonto backed by an Old West diorama the leathery relic responds to the kids curiosity by jumping back to the day in 1869 when he met lawman John Reid. Although Tontos sudden springing-to-life in a historical exhibit spurs some tentative initial laughs Verbinski doesnt sufficiently set the tone and rules of the game from the outset the uncertainty over which ripples throughout the film to deleterious effect. What is Tonto telling the kid a tall tale? A politically corrected version of the conquest of the West as the boy presumably understands it? A confessional about his own misdeeds that led to a very weird life? Just a wild story the product of an addled mind? The answer never becomes clear which encourages the view of just taking it all as a romp although this isnt entirely right either given some of the serious underpinnings. But suddenly were on a train where clean-cut prosecutor Reid (Armie Hammer) flashing a copy of John Locke at the predominantly religious passengers is delivering to justice notorious outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner). Another prisoner onboard is Tonto who once Butchs gang shows up to free its boss forcibly gets paired with the righteous lawman on the first of several Bond-sized railway action scenes designed to justify the productions laying of six miles of track in New Mexico and building two new locomotives so it could all be filmed real rather than with CGI. Still it takes nearly an hour of setup for the two to officially become a team. John Reids arrival in Colby Texas reunites him with his bounty hunter brother Dan (James Badge Dale) whose wife Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) used to be Johns sweetheart. Lording it over everyone in a way that all too closely matches the sociopolitical setup in Rango is railroad tycoon Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) who anticipates the imminent completion of the cross-country tracks and schemes to take over the whole system himself. When Tontos not around the personal drama politics and violence are all played pretty straight almost as if theyre in a different movie. Dan anoints his brother a Texas Ranger so he can join the posse formed to hunt down Butch. And when the lot of them are gunned down in an ambush (splendidly staged in Canyon de Chelly) the brutality and vivid bullet impact sound effects are sobering. Taking him for dead Tonto tries to bury John along with the others. But when the resilient big guy comes to they team up to hunt down the bad guys with John donning the black eye mask to go along with the big white hat he donned to start the journey. Several TV episodes worth of incident ensues including Butchs fiendish grab of the richest silver mine in the West Lathams treachery to control the rails and an appealingly tragic revelation of Tontos original sin that explains the two black lines running down each side of his face his outcast status from his people and perhaps why hes a bit loco. As has been the case onscreen since Little Big Man and occasionally before the treaty-oblivious U.S. government the Army and manifest destiny-minded whites are certainly the biggest bad guys. But its refreshing to see that part of Depps comic shtick here is to deflate the solemn seriousness with which Native American traditions and mysticism are usually enveloped. Sometimes cocking his eyebrow and looking at John to see if hes buying his latest line of crap Depp establishes a certain fundamental dignity for Tonto thats otherwise embellished by nutty detailing the result of which is neither a truly coherent character nor one as funny as Jack Sparrow sometimes was at least at the beginning but most surely registers due to its idiosyncratic strangeness. The madly handsome Hammer certainly delivers the Rangers requisite rectitude and straight-arrow determination but the balance between full-on hero and camp figure teeters at times a problem symptomatic of Verbinskis difficulty in finding the right pitch for the project as a whole. Perhaps Rango was liberating in that working in animation freed the director from realistic constraints thus giving him confidence to unleash the wild wacky and surreal impulses that lifted that surprising work comically and visually. There are moments of absurdist humor here as when Tonto and the Ranger find themselves buried in the ground up to their chins and the former advises his partner not to get an itch on his nose whereupon they find themselves covered with scorpions but the devil-may-care attitude of the directors last film is significantly diluted here. The bloat factor also weighs in after the two-hour mark at which point theres yet another half-hour to go. Still the average length of the Pirates films was 149 minutes precisely the duration of The Lone Ranger so it wouldnt be surprising if Bruckheimer amp; Co. decided on this as their ideal running time. VIDEO The Lone Ranger Featurette Pits Armie Hammer Against Heights Helicopter Along with the intermittent bubbling humor and appealing leads there are certainly other pleasures to be had. Despite the Texas setting most of the film has the appearance of taking place in Monument Valley and other locations -- Crede Moab Shiprock Lone Pine and various spots in New Mexico -- have been superbly chosen for great scenic value. Real trains are certainly far preferable to digitally generated ones and Hans Zimmers score which at a few points teases out echoes of one of Ennio Morricones key themes for One Upon a Time in the West is full-bodied and supportive. Rossinis trademark ""William Tell Overture"" is saved for the big-action climax. Furthermore Fichtner (with the help of some highly creative makeup work by Depps personal makeup ace Joel Harlow) serves up a first-rate villain a genuinely bad guy with a messed up mouth and a brain that doesnt miss a trick. Wilkinson is also strong if more conventionally duplicitous while Helena Bonham Carter seems to be hobbling in from another movie altogether in her brief appearance as a red-headed madame with a gun in her peg leg.

His popularity led to a spin-off series starring a little character known as the Green Hornet while his catchphrase (""Hi-ho Silver away"") and theme music (the William Tell overture) have become permanent fixtures of the popular culture lexicon. Given that pedigree a Hollywood reboot of the adventures of the masked lawman known as the Lone Ranger was inevitable. Of course that purveyor of blockbluster bloat Jerry Bruckheimer saw it as a chance to launch a new Pirates of the Caribbean-like franchise. And of course his house star of the moment Johnny Depp signed on to bring his increasingly diluted quirkiness to the role of Tonto Native American companion to our white-hat vigilante hero John Reid (Hammer nondescriptly noble). Credit where its due though Both Depp (only sort of cashing a paycheck) and his not-untalented Pirates 1-3 director Gore Verbinski have a lot of fun with the storys setup. The promising opening scene set in 1930s San Francisco cleverly introduces Tonto as an aged attraction at a Wild West carnival exhibition (Depp rather movingly performs the role under what looks like a ton of Dustin Hoffman-in-Little Big Man prosthetics). He relates his and the Rangers often-convoluted adventures to a wide-eyed young audience of one which establishes a nice air of innocence--its telling that Verbinski explicitly references Albert Lamorisses The Red Balloon (1956) in an early composition. But the childlike sense of wonder is almost immediately eliminated once the movie flashes back to the late-1800s Wild West. Though his adeptness with throwaway gags suggests he could have been a superb Warner Bros. animator (theres a particularly humorous one here involving vampire rabbits) summer tentpole morass tends to squash Verbinskis gifts. As in nearly all of his films an overstuffed plot gets the better of him Theres a mutilated and malevolent gunslinger (Fichtner expectedly bringing the crazy) prowling the land. The transcontinental railroad is winding its way through the Monument Valley desert a project overseen by a big-city businessman (Wilkinson) with clearly suspicious motivations. Theres cold-blooded murder and declarations of vengeance run-ins between the local Indians and the cavalry a whorehouse madam with a wooden gun leg (Helena Bonham Carter apparently on loan from an aborted Tim Burton project) a romantic interest and plenty of low comedy courtesy of Tontos smirky training of his new partner. Reference is even made to Depps ""stupid fucking"" role in Jim Jarmuschs 1995 acid Western Dead Man--minus the f-word lest one offend the sensitive ears of the PG-13 multiplex demographic. Its all too much and not enough--a succession of disparate can-you-top-this episodes inelegantly piling up like skidding cars on a freeway. And thats not even taking into account the action scenes. Lord those action scenes Monotonous loud and relentless theyre a punishing example of the self-satisfied digitally augmented ephemera that typifies modern Hollywood moviemaking and House Bruckheimer in particular. When Tonto moves between two speeding locomotives with chamoislike agility or the Ranger leaps across the roofs of buildings and moving vehicles on his faithful steed we never have any true sense of danger or exhilaration because everything is too uncannily seamless. Even if only at a subconscious level were all too aware were watching ones and zeroes slathered around performers making ""oh shit"" faces at objects to be fully rendered later. This machine-tooled pomposity is all the more irritating for the few times Verbinski brings a genuine sense of invention to the proceedings (he shoots some of the Monument Valley locations with a comically askew eye thats equal parts Ford and Leone). Or for those rare moments when Depp and Hammer--tossing off a quip or flashing an ingratiating grin--show a flicker of the gleam-in-the-eye ranger spirit. Otherwise ""Kemosabe"" and his faithful sidekick cant ride off into the sunset soon enough.

In classic Westerns the hero rides off into the sunset but in ""The Lone Ranger"" its Tonto we see shambling off toward Monument Valley as the credits roll. No longer simply the sidekick Tonto gets top billing in Disneys extravagant but exhausting reboot whose vaguely revisionist origin story partners a heavily face-painted Johnny Depp with the blandly handsome Armie Hammer. Directed by ""Pirates of the Caribbeans"" Gore Verbinski this over-the-top oater delivers all the energy and spectacle audiences have come to expect from a Jerry Bruckheimer production but sucks out the fun in the process ensuring sizable returns but denying the novelty value required to support an equivalent franchise. SEE ALSO Will Lone Ranger Make Armie Hammer a Superstar? Its a testament to Depps Lon Chaney-like ability to reinvent himself from role to role that so much of Bruckheimers quarter-of-a-billion-dollar gamble rides on whether he can bring some of that Jack Sparrow mojo to Hollywoods most iconic Injun. Certainly Depp plays Tonto as no one else could borrowing the look of the character from Kirby Sattlers painting ""I Am Crow"" by interpreting a bird flying directly above the head of a noble Native American as a strange sort of headdress. This odd hat proves to be Tontos only distinguishing feature when a 12-year-old Lone Ranger fan discovers him tucked away half-forgotten in a San Francisco sideshow tent. The year is 1933 months after the radio series began its popular run (Tonto did not appear until the 11th episode) and the ""noble savage"" (Depp virtually unrecognizable beneath heavy ""Little Big Man""-style makeup) offers to set the record straight about John Reids legendary exploits some six decades earlier. SEE ALSO Disney Jerry Bruckheimer See Lone Ranger as New Genre-Bending Superhero Tontos tale doesnt alter the key elements of Lone Ranger mythology so much as it expands them beginning with an unexpected memory of the masked lawman sticking up a bank. While this scene is certainly inconsistent with Reids goody-goody radio-show image it assumes that audiences know or care enough about the character to wait nearly two-and-a-half hours to discover why the Old Wests ultimate white-hat hero would break the law. Verbinski and screenwriters Ted Elliott Terry Rossio and Justin Haythe might have saved an entire reels worth of screentime by diving directly into the pics first setpiece during which bandits manage to derail an inbound train carrying the dastardly Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) to the gallows. Embellished by herds of virtual buffalo and other CG touches this stunning mostly practical sequence serves to introduce Tonto Reid and the other key players -- including railroad tycoon Latham Cole (Tom Wilkinson) older brother/model ranger Dan Reid (James Badge Dale) and soon-to-be-widowed sister-in-law Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) -- and helps to bookend an adventure that climaxes aboard another runaway train. SEE ALSO 1981 Lone Ranger Pic Galloped Quickly Into Oblivion In keeping with Elliott and Rossos ""Pirates"" formula the intervening plot proves far more complicated than such archetypal material demands and as such is likely to alienate younger viewers who may already be overwhelmed by the intensity of Verbinskis vision. The Lone Ranger may refuse to fire a gun unless absolutely necessary but the film hardly shares his pacifist philosophy its abundant carnage ranging from scary carnivorous rabbits to an ambush in which Butch kills half a dozen Texas Rangers and finishes the job by eating Dan Reids heart. Having proved his acting chops in ""Billy The Early Years"" and ""The Social Network"" Hammer offers a more uneven performance here. Alternating between silly and serious Hammer verges on slapstick at times in his portrayal of an effete Ivy League-educated lawyer (the only character here remotely concerned with dental hygiene) who requires Tontos coaching to unlock his inner heroism and exact revenge for his brothers murder. SEE ALSO Consumers to Play Cowboys and Indians with Lone Ranger As in ""Pirates"" such a vanilla protag is typically the least compelling personality onscreen (which explains why Orlando Bloom was edged aside as the series went on) though Fichtners villain is no match for Geoffrey Rushs Barbossa or Bill Nighys Davy Jones. Likewise Wilson displays nary an ounce of Keira Knightleys empowerment evidently content to play the damsel in distress while its never quite clear what Helena Bonham Carter -- looking as if she stumbled in from the nearest Tim Burton set -- is doing here playing a crimson-haired madam whose false leg conceals a double-barreled shotgun. As for the rest of this motley ensemble Verbinski did a better job of distinguishing between scraggly Western henchmen in his 2011 animated neo-oater ""Rango."" Naturally audiences will look to Depp to pick up the slack though this time the stars eccentricities seem more calculated -- and ultimately less amusing -- than before. With his bone-white face separated by four vertical black streaks Tonto certainly looks distinctive though his very appearance is what disguises the inherently Depp-like appeal of the character. Whether offering birdseed to his crow-hat or conning gullible white men into unfair trades (an amusing reversal on history) the actors bow-legged pidgin-speaking Tonto needs more dynamism to register through all that makeup. Tonto and Reid are further dwarfed by the sheer scale of the unwieldy action unfolding around them. To see these two heroes framed against vistas made famous by the likes of John Ford brings a swell of all-American pride though its easy to lose the characters amid the intricate hyper-detailed production design that has become such a Verbinski-Bruckheimer signature. This team builds things just to blow them up and by the films climax -- which juggles several high-peril situations aboard two criss-crossing locomotives including the sight of Reid riding his ""spirit horse"" Silver atop a train -- what began as an elegantly epic potentially realistic retelling of the Lone Ranger legend has devolved into Wile E. Coyote-style cartoon shenanigans. Film Review The Lone RangerReviewed at Disney Studios Burbank Calif. June 28 2013. MPAA Rating PG-13. Running time 149 MIN.

Jax says July 25 2013 at 348 am LOVED the film as well as my husband and 11 yr old Grandson. Would NOT take young children due to the violence. From the special effects to the comedy this film is entertainment in the true sense of the word and Im beginning to think the critics dont know what they are talking about.. Reply Sims says July 23 2013 at 308 pm My son and I liked the movie. We found it to have a well balanced bit of comedy with a more serious undertone. I felt it was done well. In fact I would love to see a sequel. My son and I agree that it was well worth seeing. Parts of it were hilarious. Reply Me says July 18 2013 at 204 pm Thats ridiculous Bloom never was ""edged aside"" in Pirates and Will Turner is the most compelling character to many people. Why the heck those who like the anti-heroes and the ""bad guy"" personages think that everyone thinks and feels like them? I prefer good guys. Playing a CONVINCING good guy is way harder than run around the set in the tons of makeup make faces and clown around. Sparrow was a comic relief character but by no way he had come close to do what Bloom does in POTC. Bloom is perfect for creating larger than life characters. And unlike Depp he makes them all DIFFERENT. On Stranger Tides was more horrendous than POTC 3 script and thats says a lot. It got  on the previous glory of POTC franchise but it got less money than AWE and the ROI significantly went down because POTC3 was a mess script-wise but mostly because Will and Elizabeths fans were insulted by the Studio and by Bruckheimers attempts to bring the audience to the theaters at any cost and that included the pretending that POTC were always about the favorite actor of Jerry Bruckheimer. Why is he favorite of his its another story but the dirty games and the overly aggressive PR for Depp turned away many fans form spending their . Im a fan of POTC because of Will Turner not because of Sparrow. I prefer heroes to cowards. I suppose Mr. Depp has some hidden charms that Im not aware about and there are many of his fan girls and fan boys who see them. However the slogan ""Everyone likes Sparrow"" that the prods were pushing down our throats is a hypocritical lie. NOT everyone at all. I never liked Sparrow and I never will. I dont find his selfishness and treacherous nature cute. I would be happy to see the movie about Will and Elizabeth without Jack but with some new villain and new catalyst. I would be happy to see Norrington again (there was no need to kill the guy just because the writers and the prods didnt know what to do with him). I want the original main characters back. I really miss Will Turner. Now Im saying this not to make angry Depps fans but to show that the other opinion exists. As a fan of Will Turner and as a fan of POTC (the original trilogy) Im sick and tired of hearing that the POTC success is owed to Depp only. Thats not true. He got lucky to work with a strong team that helped him a lot. The weak ""On Stranger Tides"" team only proved once again that Depp cant carry the movie on his own. The Lone Ranger has the same problem. And the big paycheck for Mr. Depp cant guarantee the big BO for a movie. Check out how much  Depps movies got before POTC (with Bloom in it). Where were Depps fans and his "" mojo"" powers? And how about the movies that he made after POTC? - The Tourist The Dark Shadows Rum Diary etc. - all of them were failures and Im not talking just about the BO. Alice got  but Alice is a movie that wouldve gotten  with or without Depp. Its a family movie based on a great book. The audience digs that. The quality of the movie however was close to none. Including Depps performance. Mad Hatter is not Jack Sparrow in the book. Maybe the prods should consider that making the movies while thinking ONLY about the  can backfire badly. Sometimes the right thing is to think about the audience that brings those . And the audience doesnt consist only of its pockets. Reply Ron Mead says July 14 2013 at 540 pm Just got through seeing the Lone Ranger and thought it was excellent. It had its drama and its funny parts. The critics would not know a good movie if it bit them. People must go and see it. Cant wait till it comes out on DVD so I can buy it. Reply Marilyn says July 13 2013 at 131 pm I loved the Lone Ranger and so did my grand kids. Hope there is a second movie. Once people see it they will live it. Wanted it to go on. Reply John T. DAlessandro says July 11 2013 at 1007 pm No one can deny that the movie is monumental. It is so vast that the story line or whatever gets lost in all the explosions. Johnny Depp is a phenomena. The part of the little kid in the museum was unneeded and slowed down the story. I didnt guess that they would make the Lone Ranger Arni Hammer into a buffoon. Worth seeing for its magnitude and its inclusion of historical events. it looks like the 250 million that Disney spent. . Reply Theresa says July 9 2013 at 956 pm I was entertained watching The Lone Ranger as I expected to be. I did not expect the same story line that I heard on radio and saw on TV.. It was fast moving and exciting. Come on guys lighten up. It was better than other movies out. Which I wouldnt go see once. The Lone Ranger Id watch again. And Im not a real Johnny Depp fan. Reply Tom says July 9 2013 at 516 pm Not the Tonto I remembered as a kid. Have no desire to ever see this movie. Just like when I went to see the first modern Sherlock Holmes movie. In the old days Holmes dealt with brain power and logic. Only in the end would ver branish a weapon. Yet the movie I went to was all about violence. I walked out on it. Reply girlie says July 9 2013 at 305 pm Great movie I loved it....Great action....And I loved both actors.....The ending was terrific Who doesnt love Johnny Dep.. Reply Robert Clark says July 9 2013 at 1151 am Whenever one notes that the movie will have Johnny Depp playing a role he can rest assured that there will be moments of laughter. The same holds true for The Lone Ranger. My only negative criticism relates to the Lone Ranger and his not wanting to fire his pistol when the conditions demand it. After all one does not chase the bad guys into the badlands expecting to catch them all unarmed. This movie does hold true to the last of the Texas Rangers; namely he does get shot albeit heals without any bullet being extracted and is told to wear the mask because the bad guys reckon they are all dead. But I found this movie very entertaining and was never reminded about the time element. I highly recommend it to any Johnny Depp fans and even western admirers. Money well spent. Reply Bill Snardman says July 8 2013 at 627 am Oater. Fun word. Used it twice I see. Probably best left in 1946 where it belongs. Reply Clint Kueker says July 7 2013 at 349 pm From the first I saw of this lone ranger (isnt worth capitals) I was sure it would fail. Just as the 1981 mess it did not follow the origin as the original Trendle-Striker creation. This guy is not a Texas Ranger to begin with there were SIX Texas Rangers not seven and a half Tonto buried the dead Rangers and made one empty grave not eight no tribe that I ever heard of dressed in a Halloween outfit certainly not with a dead crow on their head the list goes on and on and there isnt room enough here to list them all. If the producers had taken the time to consult someone even remotely familiar with the radio-TV-novels-pulp magazines (not a comic book pulp) of the Lone Ranger they could have easily made a decent movie. And by the way Depp Clayton Moore did not wear a ""jump suit"" simply a blue shirt and pants. Uhhh do you know what a jump suit is? But then who am I just someone considered a dumbbell by all you pockets full of money dudes that just cant wait to totally destroy an American icon loved by millions for over a quarter century. I do have along with many others have one of the largest collections of LR memorabilia in the country along with newspaper articles and magazine articles I have written and had published concerning the true and fictional creation of the Lone Ranger. I can guarantee you I will not be adding anything to my collection concerning this DOA (thats dead on arrival) movie. Im sure you couldnt care Two Hoots in Hell what I think and what I have written here. Uhhh maybe thats why this mess you all tried to call a movie has turned out so that there are plenty of empty seats that some people that got into the wrong theatre will have room to sit in. Cheers to the rest of the Butch Cavendish gang. You finally put down the sixth Ranger Reply Sheryl Hatchett says July 7 2013 at 208 pm We loved this movie It was whimsical creative action-packed and had a strong values- laden message. We laughed at the satirical aspects and dialog and were stirred by the actions. The pair were great Reply Vincent Caristo says July 13 2013 at 1016 pm Im with you. This movie is a disgrace to the legend of the Lone Ranger and to the memory and lifes work of Clayton Moore. Who was that masked man? Certainly not Mr. Hammer Reply nate says July 6 2013 at 949 am the lone ranger was very good because nobody from the days here didnt know the old lone ranger show so the other people dont have a word of saying anything I do because was I was younger we had the lone ranger show but this 2013 lone ranger is not even close to the last one I dont give any stars to this movie Reply Robert Clark says July 9 2013 at 1153 am All said in one sentence Exhausting but admirable. Reply gardiennepeloton says July 5 2013 at 804 am This has all the details you want in summer block buster. I grew up when you went to the Air Force Base movie house to get out of the heat in Florida. We wanted movies long Above and beyond that this was a gorgeous movie. The camera work the cinematography the panoramas oh wow. It made me want to take a trip out west again. It appealed to nostalgia too. The young man at the beginning in the Lone Ranger.. man this was classic retro. And it connected will with the serials of the 1930s radio and 1960s television with a great funny and ironic humour twist. Then the details unfurled the drama of the betrayal and savage murder of the seven rangers and the intervention of the lone savage who interconnected between the native peoples and the white man. I cannot say enough good about the movie. I enjoyed it so much I told my teenage son I was going to see it again and he wanted to come along. My partner said we had to get it after it came out on DVD. However the beautiful shots of the panoramas of the West can only be experience on wide screen and Sony 4k digital movie. Oh man this was fun movie. Reply DWoodin says July 5 2013 at 545 am I like this film and was pleasantly surprised that it was very good despite the negative reviews. I thought the movie was entertaining and the stunts were incredible. I liked Depps performance as the quirkly mystic Tonto and could understand the storyline since Tonto is the one telling the story. Its also a spoof towards the end of the movie on the Lone Ranger TV series. Citics lighten up You have forgotten that good triumphs over evil. If you like Westerns and want to be entertained I recommend this movie. Reply Ernest Hemple says July 5 2013 at 243 am A yuck of a movie. Total waste of time. Well I did get a couple of good cat naps. Terrible writing. Marginal acting. Go see Star Trek the best movie of the season. Reply Andrew says July 4 2013 at 518 am so you didnt like it because it wasnt ""real"" enough? WTF? Its a movie get over yourself critic. Reply todd says July 3 2013 at 1125 pm Critics are dumb. Everytime I see a movie get low scores from critics I know its going to be a good movie and vice versa. Reply Sindie Albright Simmons says July 3 2013 at 914 pm I loved the movie as did my 10 year old son. Johnny Depp makes any movie worth watching I will say it is good but the last 30 minutes or so are fantastic Reply Mark Amo says July 3 2013 at 541 pm This may sound impossible but I agree with the ore of this review but still recommend the movie. A little long yes... but the last 30 minutes redeems the first two hours (which arent bad just loooong). Tontos repartee w/ the spirit horse is a real hoot Reply rfinley says July 3 2013 at 410 pm Revisionist? Did you see ""Red tails""? At least this is supposed to be a fictional story Fun Its not supposed to be historical fact. Just Entertainment. Jeesesss Reply Flickmaster says July 2 2013 at 415 am Tontos headress looks like something leftover from a Mad-Max movie Reply The Kingslayer says July 1 2013 at 718 pm Johnny Depp is really becoming annoying now Ive grown tired of the quirky roles its time for Johnny to start looking for more Public Enemies type roles. Reply newsscooper says July 1 2013 at 601 pm I havent seen the film yet but its going to be tough to like it after reading so many negative reviews of it. Havent seen one totally positive review yet. Todd bad for a quarter BILLION budget flick. Reply Virginia says July 1 2013 at 601 pm Looks like the negative reviews are beginning to roll in not just from Variety and for me a lot of the ""negative"" comments are just making me wanting to see this more and it was already on the must-see-in-theater list. Sounds like a jam-packed blast of fun with spectacular action sequences and a lot of quirky snarky humor - you know what you go to a summer blockbuster for? And I cant believe critics are actually complaining about the violence level - are you kidding? As opposed to what? Its OK to poke fun at the iconic Lone Ranger and revere the character as well which it sounds like this film does among other things. This review and others make this all sound really interesting and sounds like Ill be getting my moneys worth at the cinema Reply DShapiro says July 1 2013 at 1006 am I saw the screening Saturday the audience of mostly producers reacted with lots of laugh breaks and huge applause at the end. The makers did a great job the cinematography was spectacular. And Variety did an outstanding job reviewing it. Thank. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says July 1 2013 at 758 am Zorros horse reared up in THE LEGEND OF ZORRO atop a moving rail car and film critics lampooned the action as over-the-top unrealistic. Given the laws of physics (windage and balance) and all things considered the horse standing on its hind legs blatantly reminded the audience that here is a movie not taking itself seriously at all. When the picture failed to repeat the box office success of its predescessor that promptly ended the franchise. Between the movie trailer and this review what spoils the movie is not ""the spoilers"" as much as making a parody of the legend. Reply George Valentin says July 1 2013 at 711 am The villain Butch eats the heart of the Lone Rangers brother Dan Reid and this movie gets away with a PG-13 rating? Reply Pete Moss says June 30 2013 at 948 pm If hes Lone why does he have a sidekick? Also why do these movies have to drag out their run times? I know ticket prices are expensive but Id rather be entertained for 90 minutes then be looking at my watch for 2 and half hours. Your dumb movie is not more epic because it runs on and on and on. Reply cadavra says July 1 2013 at 530 am Hes ""lone"" because he was the sole survivor of the ambush. Reply Lea says June 30 2013 at 1002 pm Thats how it is these days people who make the movie want the audience to be entertained. Obviously youre too grumpy and clueless to understand that. Go back watching your old outdated movies because trust me youre going to have a hard time watching the movies made here in the 21st century. Have fun being disliked by the many people who actually comprehend and adapt to the world now. Reply blip says June 30 2013 at 1028 pm Gee Lea were ""outdated"" because we appreciate films that have competent editors and storylines and that have the good sense to know when theyre nothing more than entertaining B-grade fluff? Have fun with your ""modern"" rambling pomposities honey. I prefer movies- and youngsters- that know when they should shut the hell up. Oh and have fun not comprehending an entire century of filmmaking dear. I bet black-and-white just blows your tiny mind- when youre not busy crying about how ""boring"" it is....

Its one thing to give the faithful sidekick top billing when that sidekick is played by Johnny Depp but the film feels constantly torn between deconstructing the legend and presenting it in a straightforward manner. Since its impossible to simultaneously sacrifice and worship a sacred cow ""The Lone Ranger"" feels schizophrenic a state of affairs that would be forgivable if it delivered as a post-modern comedy or as an exciting Western or even as an exhilaratingly brainless piece of summer entertainment. See video Armie Hammer Reaches Terrifying New Heights in Lone Ranger Behind-the-Scenes Featurette With director Gore Verbinski the man behind the first three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movies at the helm ""The Lone Ranger"" is none of those things. The results are both joyless and seemingly endless as its two-and-a-half-hour running time stretches out like a desert horizon barren of shade or water. Like most reboots of a familiar pop-culture character this ones an origins story told in flashback by a wizened Tonto (Depp) reduced to working in a ""Wild West"" sideshow in 1933 San Francisco. His story takes a wide-eyed lad (Mason Cook) - and us - back to the days when the railroads were just beginning to cross the country. Lawyer John Reid (Armie Hammer) returns to this untamed territory armed with a snappy suit and a copy of John Lockes ""Two Treatises of Government"" although his brother Dan (James Badge Dale also currently appearing in ""World War Z"" and ""Iron Man 3"") prefers a gun and badge as a member of the Texas Rangers. Also read Why Johnny Depp Quit Drinking Also on John Reids train is the nefarious Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) who ups the ante on his villainy by consuming the hearts of his enemies; locked up alongside him is Tonto who has been pursuing Cavendish because he believes the white man is actually the Wendingo a beast who must be stopped before he throws nature out of balance. John Reid is deputized by his brother to pursue Cavendish after he escapes and when the Rangers are ambushed John is the only survivor although Tonto who finds the slaughtered search party in the desert thinks John has died and returned to life. To maintain the illusion that there were no survivors Tonto encourages John to wear a mask as the two continue to pursue Cavendish and his henchmen. Also read The Muppets James Bobin in Early Talks to Direct Johnny Depp in Alice in Wonderland 2 (Exclusive) Theres intrigue (Tom Wilkinson plays a railroad man dripping with nefarious intent) romance (Dans wife Rebecca played by Ruth Wilson has always had a thing for John) and suspense (the bad guys kidnap Rebecca and her son and there are runaway trains and bombs under bridges) not to mention off-screen genocide and spirit animals and Helena Bonham-Carter as a madam whose artificial leg hides a firearm and Barry Pepper impersonating Richard Mulligan impersonating George Custer in ""Little Big Man."" What there isnt amongst all these characters and incidents and plot twists is much fun. The running gags (everyone greets the title character with ""Whats with the mask?"") get old fast the talented actors often feel crushed by the material and the gigantic set pieces dont deliver the awe and wonder you would expect. It could be argued that most of the computer-generated action extravaganzas of the last several decades represent filmmakers trying desperately to remake ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" over and over again. And for what many of these films lack in originality they make up for in bravura and sheer adrenaline - ""Fast and Furious 6"" and ""White House Down"" are both utterly silly but when things start blowing up and characters defy physics to save themselves and each other you gasp and you feel that flutter of excitement that is the raison detre of movies like these. Also read Disney Taps Kon-Tiki Filmmakers to Direct Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean 5 In ""The Lone Ranger"" however I sat back and thought ""Wow two trains chasing each other. Impressive"" but I never twisted around in my seat feeling each close call and internalizing every near-miss. When ""The Lone Ranger"" finally becomes a Lone Ranger movie well into the third act - booming Rossini score charging horse and all - you get a few seconds of excitement and you can see how perfect a choice Hammer was in portraying this all-American hero. But that moment is over all too quickly and then were back to the bloated spectacle. Whether or not Depps casting actually qualifies as redface - the actor claims some Native American heritage in his ancestry - the film has been designed for Tonto to ironically undercut our hero at every turn. We are told ""kemo sabe"" means ""wrong brother"" since Tonto thinks its Dan and not John who should have returned from death to get revenge on Cavendish. Also read Disney Sets Release Dates for Cinderella New Marvel Movies Depp lands the occasional one-liner but his presence in the movie actively undercuts our investment in the Lone Ranger as a character much less as a hero. Imagine Christopher Nolan casting Joan Rivers as Alfred in the ""Dark Knight"" movies so she could follow around Batman and make jokes about his ridiculous outfit. ""The Lone Ranger"" is a drag as an action movie its not funny in its attempts at self-parody and it feels like a Western made by people working off a checklist of tropes without ever really understanding the genre. Verbinski and his writers have taken a promising idea and put a silver bullet in its head. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
