Providing a rock-solid new direction for Universals surprisingly successful refried ""Mummy"" franchise ""The Scorpion King"" expands -- or rather reinvents -- wrestling superstar The Rocks titular character from the last chapters brief special guest appearance to a central heros role. Taking place entirely in the ancient Middle East (as opposed to the 1930s with occasional flashbacks like 1999s ""The Mummy"" and last years ""The Mummy Returns"") pic says nix to any onscreen mummies; thats just one among many smart less-is-more decisions made. Indeed this scaled-down sinewy adventure is perhaps most notable for what it discards The last two features production bloat fx overkill running-time runover and increasingly feeble self-mockery are all quite pleasantly absent. With The Rocks TV fandom added to series carryover B.O. pull ""The Scorpion King"" should do muscular biz worldwide. Not really a sequel (or prequel) save in brand ID new chapter (co-penned by prior pics writer-helmer Stephen Sommers) simply forgets the Scorpion Kings status as a malevolent-supernatural-force in ""Returns."" Instead hes presented as a nomadic assassin-for-hire during some more primitive period ""before the pyramids"" -- which choice also neatly excuses ""Kings"" less grandiose production trappings. Somewhat cartoonish first scene has Mathayas (Rock) rescuing his brother and fellow Acadian tribesmen from execution in the lair of barbarians. These skirmishing desert clans are the last remaining resistance to warlord Memnon (Steven Brand) a ruthless despot whose control of the region is fortified by reluctant collaborator Cassandra (Kelly Hu) -- a sorceress who can see the future thus providing Memnon an invincible tactical advantage. Select tribes band together deciding that only Memnons overthrow will stop the ongoing carnage. Despite opposition from one leader Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan) they hire Mathayas amp; Co. to assassinate Memnon in his Gomorrah palace. The brigands are betrayed however by doublecrossing Prince Takmet (Peter Facinelli). Only Mathayas survives narrowly escaping with Cassandra as his hostage. Swordsman and sorceress annoy one another in typical genre fashion until his bravery and unexpected loyalty win her over -- even if (implied) sack action means her extra-normal powers will be weakened. After an excellent sequence in which Mathayas stealthily kills off would-be assassins he Cassandra and comic-relief thief Arpid (Grant Heslov) reunite with Balthazars rebel populace. Latter however figures Cassandras presence will mean their doom. To save them she sneaks back to Gomorrah. Hero and his allies follow suit sparking climactic battle. If the two latter-day ""Mummy"" pics replaced original 1930s series horror with ""Indiana Jones""-type swashbucklery ""The Scorpion King"" shifts tenor again toward sword-and-sandal action closest in spirit to John Milius 1982 ""Conan the Barbarian"" grittier 50s/60s toga epics and the various ""Thief of Baghdad"" incarnations. This latest endeavor is no classic. Yet its traditionalism refreshes amidst so many overblown recent digital fx fests -- ""The Mummy Returns"" being one of the most slapdash-scripted camp-exhausted examples among them. By contrast ""Scorpion"" rouses excitement mostly from stuntwork and thesp agility rather than CGI excess. Notably its nonstop fighting leaves gore and grossout conceits to the imagination as opposed to the borderline-distasteful violence of the ostensibly more family-friendly ""Mummy Returns."" With his striking good looks powerful physique and ease before the camera The Rock undergoes transition from entertainment-sports celebrity to movie star as if to the manner born. Of course this custom-tooled role hardly demands or reveals much thesping range. Still hes already leagues ahead of many prior athlete-actors in terms of screen charisma and hinted intelligence. He does nicely enough with the scripts few offhandedly smart-ass lines -- which director Chuck Russell (""Eraser"" ""The Mask"") wisely directs all thesps to underplay. Clarke aside support cast is void of marquee value but theyre quite good within genre bounds. All women here are scantily clad and babelicious; Hu nonetheless carries herself with an attractive dignity. Brand a European theater-trained feature debutant sports considerable authority. Production is definitely downscaled from the splashy extravagance of the ""Mummy"" outings. Yet its always handsome thanks to John R. Leonettis burnished lensing and Ed Verreauxs impressive production design. John Debneys score combines orchestral anthems with heavy-metal guitar oomph. Greg Parsons and Michael Tronicks editing is spot-on other tech credits strong.

USATODAY.com - Cheesiness dulls sting of Scorpion Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/19/2002 - Updated 0307 PM ET Cheesiness dulls sting of ScorpionBy Mike Clark USA TODAY The Rock as Mathayus in a scene from The Scorpion King. The Scorpion King (out of four)Stars The Rock Steven Brand Kelly Hu Michael Clarke Duncan Grant HeslovRating PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence and some sensuality View the trailer Everyone wants a piece of The Rock in The Scorpion King. The villain (Steven Brands warlord Memnon) of this convenience-store epic wants his head. A sexy sorceress (Kelly Hu) wants The Rocks hard body. A digitized army of red ants spotting him buried in desert sand up to his head want to feast off his face. Jaw-flapping cobras (as artificial-looking as the ants) want their share of the meal too.Less pleased with itself this prequel to the overblown Mummy movies showcases the WWF champ after his first thespian turn in The Mummy Returns and its for moviegoers who like their pizzas with extra cheese. Dull but not unspeakably so Kings inherent goofiness begins with the fact that its the rare prequel that takes place nearly 2000 years before the movie that inspired it.Then theres Memnons appearance. With curly hair on top a hacked-off skull cut on the sides and a cascading mullet he looks a little like actor Fred Ward might after paying a crackhead to cut his hair. Memnon is mean too. He dips the tips of his arrows in scorpion venom one of which gives The Rocks wounded Mathayus character a much higher fever than he ever seems to get from willing sorceress Cassandra. The warrior survives but now he must carry the poison inside him forever. Maybe Mathayus should ring up Wesley Snipes half-vampire Blade and invite him to compare notes over dinner.To sustain the movies PG-13 rating it appears that Cassandra has her hair glued to her breasts even while bathing in a fabled sin city Gomorrah. But when riding to and away from the Valley of the Dead (probable home of the script) she often sports a cleavage-revealing slit-up-the-gams garb that must necessitate a lot of sunscreen No. 45. If the costuming is standard for Hollywood desert adventures the off-the-wall casting of Michael Clarke Duncan (of The Green Miles electric chair fame) isnt. Duncan probably wont get a second Oscar nomination for playing Balthazar a reluctant ally to the king.Director Chuck Russell has worked with Arnold Schwarzenegger (Eraser) and Jim Carrey (The Mask) but he cant make his movie more than affably dopey or turn his lead into an appreciably better actor than Hulk Hogan. Of course The Rock looks the part though with a headband and buckskin hed also look like Tonto on steroids. But at least The Rock is using his stage (and not real) name here which is a marquee plus. Its tough to imagine anyone rushing the box office for The Scorpion King starring Dwayne Johnson.

Starring the Rock Kelly Hu Steven Brand and Grant Heslov. Directed by Chuck Russell. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 96 minutes.) ""The Scorpion King"" is a spin-off from last years ""The Mummy Returns"" but dont hold that against it. This is a genial action movie that succeeds by finding the right tone (fairly light) and the correct pace (medium fast) and by placing appealing characters at its center. Like every other action movie its designed for a 14-year-old boys mentality but its enjoyable enough to turn most people into 14-year-old boys. At the center of every frame if only because of his size is the Rock a professional wrestler who is the most incongruous-looking leading man since Arnold Schwarzenegger. The Rock is big and beefy and onscreen he is mainly about his undeniable physical presence. Yet if the Rock looks mean in still photos he seems like a reasonable fellow the moment he starts talking. In this world of 5000 years ago civilization is composed of various tribes and the power-hungry Memnon (Steven Brand) is in the process of conquering them. Memnons secret weapon in his quest for power is his sorceress (Kelly Hu) who sees into the future and knows when he should attack his enemies. The Rock plays Mathayus who in the movies first minutes is commissioned to assassinate the sorceress and from there ""The Scorpion King"" becomes a series of adventures containing some genuinely stirring action scenes. Director Chuck Russell and his screenwriters stay true to the time period and dont rely on special effects. They hold the audience with imagination and a playful spirit. Advisory This film contains sexual situations and violence.

"Scorpion King The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; scorpion-king-the ) Scorpion King The (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli Watching The Scorpion King the question that came to mind was whether Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson could become a Schwarzenegger for the 00s. Having asked that however its worth considering whether Schwarzenegger in his prime could have had the same kind of career had he started today. The 80s were a different decade and the kind of muscle-bound hulking hero that Arnold represented might no longer have a place in cinematic circles. WWF mega-star The Rock resembles a younger Schwarzenegger in many ways he has the same kind of physique the same complete lack of acting ability the same screen presence and the same general appeal. Only the accent is missing. And much as Arnold made his feature film splash in Conan the Barbarian The Rock is using this low-rent Conan as his first starring vehicle. The Scorpion King is based on a character introduced in The Mummy Returns. However anyone expecting a film with the same kind of tongue-in-cheek Indiana Jones-ish style will be disappointed. Aside from the presence of Mathayus the ""Scorpion King"" and the fact that some of the action takes place in the desert there are no connections between this film and either of the Mummy outings. As I stated above this is more in the vein of a Conan or a Thirteenth Warrior than its immediate cinematic cousins. The story is about as lifeless and predictable as one might expect. Mathayus is a mercenary assassin from a ""clan of cutthroats that kill for money"". He is hired by an outcast ruler to stop the mighty Memnon (Steven Brand) the warrior king whose armies are systematically destroying their opposition. The reason for Memnons seeming invincibility lies in the clairvoyant powers of his sorceress sidekick Cassandra (Kelly Hu). Mathayus is supposed to kill her but when he is unable to he opts for kidnapping her instead. It turns out that because she dislikes Memnon she becomes a willing victim. Soon Mathayus and Cassandra are involved and on the run. With the help of the great warrior Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan) and an inept thief (Grant Heslov) Mathayus decides to infiltrate Memnons fortress and challenge the great swordsman to one-on-one combat. A little more originality or energy wouldnt have hurt The Scorpion King. Its fine to see The Rock body-slam a few foes and to catch a fleeting glimpse of the delightful Kelly Hus naked flesh (she has a couple of nice peek-a-boo scenes) but those are hardly reasons enough to sit through any movie. The sword fights are perfunctory and obligatory the villain doesnt snarl or foam at the mouth enough and the ""comic"" sidekicks are so clichA(c)d that they provoke more yawns than laughs. Even the special effects arent all that special. Three in particular - a fire ant attack a group of angry cobras and a sandstorm - are so obviously computer-generated that they come across as cheap and artificial. The ""creative"" forces (and I use that word loosely) behind The Scorpion King are director Chuck Russell and co-screenwriter Stephen Sommers. Sommers the writer and director of the two Mummy movies is given some credit for both the story and screenplay. Russell who is no stranger to having worked with bulky actors (he directed Schwarzenegger in his last profitable outing Eraser) does a workmanlike job. Of course he is hamstrung by a limp script and a group of actors whose primary previous exposure has been on television or on the wrestling mat. It is possible to make an engaging action/adventure picture of this sort but The Scorpion King isnt it. The movie isnt godawful but its far from inspired and as I sat through its 90 minute running length I found my mind wandering. Im sure that wrestling fans will enjoy the spectacle of seeing their hero on the big screen for an extended period of time but the plainness of The Scorpion King will leave most average viewers unimpressed. Big men with big muscles arent what they used to be.

Twenty years ago Arnold Schwarzenegger was the right hulk at the right time. His brusque Teutonic accent like his engorged physique was always a semijoke but in the formative years of the Reagan age his outsize eccentricity was somehow goofy-cool. He seemed to speak to the notion that pure aggressive will for America at large remained a somewhat foreign concept. It may be less foreign now. In an age of ongoing military engagement the ability to assert our will comes a lot more naturally than it once did and thats part of the appeal of The Rock He makes invincible displays of strength look easy and charming. Parody of course is built into his act as a professional wrestler and as he has proved in two appearances on ""Saturday Night Live"" hes a gracious sly-dog comedian with a knack for self-mockery that makes Arnolds look practically medieval in its obviousness. As Mathayus the ancient desert assassin of The Scorpion King The Rock commands the screen as naturally as he does the ring; hes like Arnold with a fresh coat of paint and a fresh personality too. In the films prologue he shoots a bow and arrow so hard that the pierced victim goes spinning through the air. Then in a very calm close-up he says ""Boo"" all to let you know that hes perfectly jovial about the lethal tasks at hand. The camera likes The Rocks face and thats because its an interesting face - at once exotic and square-jawed suburban with small daggers for sideburns even smaller ones for eyebrows and shocking white eyes that pop out with the incongruous ferocity of a hypnotists. He looks like a cross between Rob Schneider and Tony Robbins and its that small man/big man counterpoint that makes him such an approachable humanistic giant. The Rock may be the new face of Hollywood action but ""The Scorpion King"" isnt exactly a lightning vehicle. Executive-produced by WWF mastermind Vince McMahon (a frightening thought) and directed by Chuck Russell who made what is arguably the logiest Schwarzenegger movie ever (""Eraser"") ""The Scorpion King"" is The Rocks version of ""Conan the Barbarian"" - a clunky primitive platform for a star who has yet to get in full touch with his inner Terminator. The picture is being marketed as a prequel to ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"" and technically speaking thats exactly what it is. But fans of that series with its armies of digital goblins that never look too threatening because they appear to be made entirely of fairy-dust pixels may miss the sensation of spending two hours living inside a videogame. With the exception of one brief sequence in which The Rock buried up to his neck in sand has to with-stand an onslaught of creepy-crawlies ""The Scorpion King"" isnt a techie-blowout visual-effects party. Its crude and prosaic a storming-the-cardboard-castle potboiler with reasonably vigorous sword fights served up every 15 minutes or so like commercials. In place of the hieroglyphic Indy Jones Lite mumbo jumbo that Brendan Fraser and Co. had so much fun whipping through we get a lumbering plot in which Mathayus known as the Akkadian (hes the last of a breed) is hired to do away with Memnon (Steven Brand) a fascist conqueror in a fancy Mohawk who seems no more threatening than a surly British concert promoter. With his longhaired heavy-metal gladiator stylings The Rock may have copped his look from Tina Turners henchman in ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"" but in ""The Scorpion King"" you wish he were surrounded by a comparable level of decadent excitement. Mathayus teams up with one of those scruffy-pest sidekicks (Grant Heslov) who speaks in a nameless foreign accent as he delivers lines like ""Theyve got the city sealed up tighter than a crabs buttocks"" In addition he absconds with the Sorceress who has the ability to foresee the outcome of any battle - a good idea that the movie doesnt do enough with. As played by Kelly Hu the Sorceress isnt much more than a midriff and a breathy monotone. As a filmmaker Chuck Russell has a way of cutting between forceful establishing shots - of a mountain a desert a castle - and close-ups so stagy that they border on invitations to revive ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" ""The Scorpion King"" as a whole however isnt incompetent; its just plodding and obvious. If anything holds it together its The Rocks ironic ability to tread lightly which the movie is neither fast nor inventive enough to recognize as different from the spirit of Arnold. With Schwarzenegger you feel the heavy labor that goes into crushing each foe. The Rock is more like a colossus for the age of special ops He looks all too happy to kill without bruising.
