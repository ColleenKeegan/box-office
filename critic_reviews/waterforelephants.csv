Jason Priestley and Luke Perry. David and Shaun Cassidy. Scott Baio. Leonardo DiCaprio. James Van Der Beek. Zac Efron. Daniel Radcliffe. Johnny Depp. Theres nothing harder than going from teen heartthrob to adult male star. Its a road many have traveled though few successfully. Who knows whether James Dean would have had a sustained career into his thirties and forties if he hadnt crashed his Porsche on a rural California highway at age 24 in 1955. The jury is still out of course on Efron and Radcliffe who at 23 and 21 respectively have only been shaving for a few years. Of the rest of the list above Travolta Depp and DiCaprio have had continuing major league careers while the others have had to find new day jobs. Part of the problem is that exactly what it is about these guys that makes the hearts of teen girls flutter works against them when they age. Theres something a little soft and non-threatening about them theyre frequently slight of build and diminutive in height - early objects of lust for their female tween and teen fans no matter how much of a bad boy image they project. But it also makes that transition to adult male lead a greater challenge especially when they must appeal equally to male moviegoers if not more so. With rare exceptions -- hello Tyrone Power and Brad Pitt -- pretty boys just dont cut it past age 25. Robert Pattinson now 24 clearly wants an adult career. The British-born actor of course rose risen to stardom and tabloid fame playing nice guy vampire Edward Cullen in the first three ""Twilight"" films (with the final two chapters still to come the first this year and the concluding installment in 2012). Its the role that fans adore him in and want to see him playing. When he attempted to go beyond his blood-sucking signature role in last years ""Remember Me"" the romantic drama grossed less than 20 million at the box office. His portrayal of the bisexual artist Salvador Dali in ""Little Ashes"" made even less of a ripple at the box office. Now comes ""Water for Elephants"" based on a bestselling 2006 novel by Sara Gruen. In this period romantic drama directed by Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") Pattinson plays Jacob a veterinary student during the Great Depression. When his parents die he joins a traveling circus where his duties including looking after a newly purchased elephant. He soon becomes smitten with Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) the shows star performer. The hitch her husband August (Christoph Waitz) the circus owner is a jealous sadistic guy. The movie draws you in early on with its period detail and insiders glimpse at the daily minutia of circus life. But the well goes dry quickly despite much huffing and puffing as it becomes clear that ""Water"" is interested only in its three major characters and their complicated romantic dilemma. Supporting characters are too hastily sketched in serving only to further the unsmooth course of true love. The trouble is the triangle is too narrow a focus -- and it doesnt help that theres little heat between Pattinson and Witherspoon. While he gives a passable performance as an impassioned young swain Witherspoon doesnt project the vulnerability her  character needs. One can easily imagine her as a fast-talking full of moxie screwball heroine in a 30s setting but as the in-need-of-recue Marlena shes just too brittle. Im guessing ""Water"" will please Pattinsons enthusiastic fans. His character is (sigh) sensitive and protectively caring of his ladylove - those same qualities that have endeared his Edward Cullen to Twihards. Its a promising step on the road away from Forks Washington but too soon to tell if it will be enough. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

An epic Depression-era circus romance with hard-luck heroes charismatic villains edge-of-your-seat suspense jealousy revenge wit heart and of course a marvelous elephant named Rosie. Its a historically inspired ode to the big top thats larger than life. So its no surprise that I Am Legend director Francis Lawrence and screenwriter Richard Lagravenese (P.S. I Love You) decided to stage Sara Gruens best-selling novel in the grandest venue of all--the big screen. At a little over two hours the film Water for Elephants stays true to Gruens tale in the time it has. Though it merges trainer August and circus boss Al into one character (theyre better together). It begins with 93-year-old former circus vet Jacob Jankowski lamenting old age--the anticlimactic finale to a ""big life"" that reduces him to sneaking out of his nursing home at night to stand in the rain waiting to see the Circus Vargus set up. The adaptation thankfully spends less time on his misery (a Notebook-esque downer enough to make everyone dread their ""golden years""). After one last gripe about his neglectful children to the kind Vargus manager trying to contact the nursing home hes off reminiscing about his menagerie man days. Fade to 1931 and despite the Depression on the final day of exams 23-year-old Cornell veterinary student Jacobs (Robert Pattinson) future looks bright. Then his parents die in a car crash. Left penniless due to debts and with no other family Jacob does what other impoverished men of the age do and hits the rails hoofing it Albany to seek work. When a train approaches he hops on. While Benzini Bros. bouncer Blackie prefers tossing him out grandfatherly lush Camel convinces him that his clothes prove hes no ""bum"". Not sure if he ""chose the train or it chose him"" Jacob smiles at serendipity. Camel is his ticket into a big top universe of exotic beasts lusty Coochie Girls and high-flying feats. A ""heaven"" that awes him especially its dazzling equestrian star circus owner Augusts wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). Instantly smitten he offers to examine her limping stallion and soon talks his way into a job as the circus vet. His first day he defies August and is nearly redlighted i.e. pitched off a moving train. (also Augusts favorite downsizing strategy.) Hes the sort of schizo tyrant Waltz can sink his teeth into despicable yet charming; brutal yet wounded. ""Nobody "" observes Marlena ""stops [working] or dies til August says so"". Hes a champion of animal cruelty but hes also a businessman struggling to save Benzini Bros. from becoming like the circus carcasses of tattered tents and homeless lions they cannibalize. Either way hes the last person you want in your love triangle. While Waltzs evil ringmaster is the stuff of second Oscars an actor less moony-eyed and -mouthed than Rpatz might have made Jacob more captivating--though its hard to point a finger at anything truly amiss with his performance. Holbrooks also a bit flat. Its easy to envision Michael Gambon delivering more vim and vigor. Witherspoon does Marlena well and has good-enough chemistry with Patterson. As to the rest--set costumes prohibition raids circus-rube grifts and wafting Louis Armstrong ballads --Lawrence aptly captures a snapshot of the nostalgic allure and gritty harshness of the time. At moments close ups (like Rosies headstands and well-timed hat stealing) and low perspectives make one daydream theyre at the center of a 1930s circus. At other times however jigsaw scene crops and awkward head shut you out of the story. Like Camels train-car tour of circus society--so narrowly framed we hardly glimpse the colorful people he describes. If Gruens true-to-life tale stole your heart youll be thrilled a film finally breathed life into it. If you havent read it youll likely still be entertained--especially by Waltz and Rosie. Water for Elephants may not be the best show on earth but its still quite a show.

But dont fret their love stays as unconsummated as that of Bella and Edward in Twilight. This adaptation of a Sara Gruen novel plays as one long flashback we dissolve to 1931 as nonagenarian Jacob (Hal Holbrook) tells of his early life he jumped a circus train after the death of his Polish parents and the end of his Ivy League veterinary career. Told at a leisurely pace and with attractive period detail the film explores a four-way tussle between young Jacob (Pattinson) circus boss August (Christoph Waltz again hiding a dagger behind a grin) his showgirl wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) and elephant Rosie (Tai the biggest ham of the lot). Its overlong yet paradoxically the final stages feel rushed. But Water for Elephants has charm and this more grown up role suits Pattinson more than the histrionics of last years Remember Me. The film offers a life lesson for pet owners too next time your animal plays up try talking to it in Polish.

"Water for Elephants | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; water-for-elephants ) Water for Elephants (United States 2011) April 23 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli The primary draw for Water for Elephants is the pairing of Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson (ignore the ten year age gap) in a love story based on the best-selling novel by Sara Gruen. Sadly passion and romance are two ingredients missing from this melodrama which does an excellent job of re-creating the Depression-era circus business but is less successful in generating the needed heat between the two leads. The great intangible of chemistry isnt present making Water for Elephants seem longer and slower than one might hope. There arent any truly awful performances. Robert Pattinson shows the same kind brooding melancholia that haunts his character in the Twilight movies; if Pattinson desires an escape hatch from the typecasting cage he might want to try a comedy. Otherwise hell be doomed to take roles devised for a second-rate James Dean until the box office runs dry. Reese Witherspoon shows none of the boundless charisma and energy that propelled her onto the A-list a decade ago but she looks cute sitting astride an elephant. The scene-stealer is Christoph Waltz whose portrayal is so volcanic and persuasive that he almost singlehandedly makes Water for Elephants worthwhile. Its too bad his complex psychologically disturbed character turns into a generic villain as the movie careens toward its climax. For the most part Richard LaGraveneses script is faithful to the source novel although some characters have been combined and others deleted altogether. There are also obvious instances in which subplots have been clumsily half-deleted leaving behind extraneous remnants. The production as assembled by director Francis Lawrence is at its most exacting when presenting some of the nuts-and-bolts details of how the circus business worked during an era when money and jobs were in short supply. The Benzini Brothers circus travels from locale to locale by train. The performers and workers live in cramped quarters that they call home; they risk being thrown off if the bosses are short on cash. The process by which the Big Top is assembled is detailed in a short but unforgettable sequence. Unfortunately all of this is merely color and background for the flat uninspired love story. The story is narrated by a 90-year old Jacob Jankowski (Hal Holbrook) who gazes back nearly 70 years (to when hes played by Robert Pattinson) through the mists of time. Just as he is about to graduate from Cornell with a degree in veterinary science his parents are tragically killed in a car crash leaving him homeless and penniless. Jumping aboard a train with the intention of traveling somewhere... anywhere... he discovers that his mode of transportation isnt an anonymous freight locomotive but the one carrying the trappings of the circus. Rather than tossing Jacob off the train the owner August (Christoph Waltz) hires him to be the official Benzini Brothers vet. Jacob cares for the animals and trains the newest attraction an elephant but he also begins to fall in love with the circus star and Augusts wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). Their clandestine affair arouses Augusts suspicion and murderous jealousy. The production design is impressive; Water for Elephants feels like a slice of Depression era lore. However as good as Lawrence is in depicting the construction of the Big Top and the subsequent show beneath it he seems lost when it comes to generating heat between his leads. Perhaps hampered by the necessary PG-13 rating the sex scene which is intended to be a combination of tasteful eroticism and tenderness embodies neither quality. Its merely repetitive close-ups of a man and a woman kissing and removing clothing in poorly lit conditions. Theres an old-fashioned vibe to Water for Elephants; its the kind of movie Hollywood once turned out with regularity but rarely does anymore. In the best of these films the lead characters connect with such force that their emotions carry them through the story. Here unfortunately August turns out to be more intriguing than Jacob and Marlena combined. He draws the attention while the script focuses on them. That structural flaw might have been avoided with a different cast; expecting the mismatched Pattinson and Witherspoon to inspire audiences to yearn for their coupling demands an effort of elephantine proportions.

Water for Elephants Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson find love among the pachyderms. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 22 2011 456 PM Water for Elephants I kind of loved this suburban-grandma movie. By Dana Stevens Water for Elephants My affection for Water for Elephants (Fox Studios) is essentially indefensible. The movie directed by Francis Lawrence ( I Am Legend) is stodgy old-fashioned predictable and sentimental. Based on a best-selling novel by Sara Gruen it has the fussy overstuffed feel of a too-faithful adaptation. Yet theres a strange pleasure in letting this faintly ridiculous film wash over you on an April afternoon. The copper-burnished cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto the charmeuse bias-cut 30s dresses the scratchy gramophones playing Bessie Smith--yes this is the kind of movie you could imagine seeing with your grandmother at a suburban mall but does everything have to be edgy and dark and genre-reinventing? Isnt it OK once in a while just to enjoy the spectacle of two beautiful people kissing in a train car in the shadow of an elephant? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Much of the ridicule being dispensed in Water for Elephants general direction is a knee-jerk reaction to the casting of Robert Pattinson the moony-eyed vampire Edward Cullen of the Twilight series. As Jacob Jankowski the animal-loving son of Polish immigrants during the Depression Pattinson gets to do something he doesnt often do as Edward smile. This isnt a role that puts Pattinsons thespian skills to the most rigorous of tests but at least it lets him out of his gloomy vampires lair long enough to enjoy some time in the sun (along with a little PG-13-rated nookie). Advertisement Jacob is about to complete his veterinary degree at Cornell when both his parents are killed in a car crash. Alone and penniless he hops a passing train that turns out to belong to the Benzini Bros. traveling circus. Beginning as a manure-shoveler Jacob is soon promoted to house vet. But he falls afoul of the circus moody owner August Rosenbluth (Christoph Waltz) when he refuses to overwork the injured horse that stars in an equestrian act with Rosenbluths beautiful young wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). Getting to know each other over the body of a horse youve just had to shoot in the head is pretty much the opposite of a meet-cute. But Marlena and Jacob connect via their shared love of animals and their fear of August a driven obsessive man who can be cruel one minute and generous the next. August nearly bankrupts the circus when he invests in an elephant that balks at his brutal training methods. Eventually Jacob discovers the secret to making the animal perform--Ill keep that secret a secret as it leads to one of the movies few real surprises--and the Benzini Bros. elephant act with Marlena as rider becomes the shows big moneymaker. All is well until August begins to notice the mutual affection between his wife and his veterinarian ... In a frame story Jacob as an old man (a wonderful Hal Holbrook) recounts his eventful life to a modern-day circus employee (an underused but memorable Paul Schneider). Theres something ludicrous in the notion that Robert Pattinson would grow up to be Hal Holbrook but as elsewhere in the movie youre willing to grant Water for Elephants its Hollywood conventions. Neither Pattinson nor Witherspoon quite make sense in their roles--hes too ethereal to be a working-class Polish vet shes too elegant to be a seen-it-all carny. But again this harks back to Old Hollywood in a not-unpleasant way Was Gloria Grahame realistically cast as an elephant rider in The Greatest Show on Earth (1952)? Christoph Waltz has come to specialize in playing urbane seemingly civilized men who harbor an enormous reservoir of cruelty--variations on his unforgettable Nazi officer in  Inglourious Basterds--and he invests August Rosenbluth with more moral complexity than the script by Richard LaGravenese would seem to allow. Waltz should be careful of getting typecast as the suave loose cannon because hes almost too good at it. His performance is the best one by a human in the film. In truth my inexplicably serene goodwill toward this thoroughly silly movie stems mainly from the presence of Rosie a pink-and-gray-mottled Indian elephant played by a 42-year-old pachyderm named Tai. In the age of CGI animals (and real animals movements altered by digital effects) the scenes with the elephant and other big animals have a lovely simplicity and freshness The creatures are simply there doing (with some exceptions) what they appear to be doing and sharing the frame with actors. When Jacob reaches fearfully into an angry male lions cage to shove in a bucket of meat we see the real Robert Pattinson being terrified of a real lion. (Pattinson and Waltz apparently referred to their lion scenes as the ""no acting required"" part of the job.) When Rosie interrupts Jacob and Marlenas flirtation by waving an inquisitive trunk between them the moment feels spontaneous and playful the kind of happy accident that only happens in filming with a real animal. And when Rosie tortured by Augusts bullhook lies beaten and bleeding even non-PETA types will share Jacob and Marlenas horror. The ostensible romantic leads of Water for Elephants may make for a less than smoldering couple but their chemistry with Rosie is sensational.

David James/20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption David James/20th Century Fox Water For Elephants Director Francis Lawrence Genre Adapted Drama Running Time 122 minutes Rated PG-13 for moments of intense violence and sexual content With Reese Witherspoon Robert Pattinson Christoph Waltz Paul Schneider Jim Norton Watch Clips Im A Star Attraction Im A Star Attraction Credit 20th Century Fox Meet Our Salvation Meet Our Salvation Credit 20th Century Fox Just Come With Me Just Come With Me Credit 20th Century Fox For all I know the actor Robert Pattinson may be hell on wheels onstage where hes done Shakespeare and Cole Porter. But thus far in his film career hes mostly demonstrated uncommonly lovely bones and a thorough mastery of looking tenderly down upon the desolate damsels nestled in his arms. No one has yet asked him to do any serious screen acting -- with or without sparkly sprinkles on the preternaturally pale skin that along with his apparent reluctance to play celebrity has proved so alluring to American teenage girls. Water for Elephants a Depression-era romantic drama adapted by screenwriter Richard LaGravenese (The Bridges of Madison County) from the best-selling novel by Sara Gruen asks little more of Pattinson than did the Twilight franchise unless you count the ability to charm an elderly pachyderm into doing his bidding with a few words from the Polish phrasebook. Beyond that its the same old anguished stares into the middle distance garnished with the occasional enigmatic grimace and a puzzling reluctance to jump the bones of Reese Witherspoon. Which seems a pity given that the movie which plays a bit like a young-adult version of They Shoot Horses Dont They? gets the plot out of the house and on the road to action-adventure with the brisk efficiency one would expect from director Francis Lawrence who made the very busy I Am Legend. Pattinson plays a veterinary student who deprived of a solid future by the sudden death of his loving parents takes to riding the rails. With remarkable speed given the times Jacob finds work caring for sick animals in a traveling circus headed by August (Christoph Waltz) a manipulative bully whose adored wife (Witherspoon) is the heavily sequined transparently unhappy star attraction of the floundering enterprise. Bonding over a dying horse and its endearing successor Rosie the Elephant Witherspoons Marlena and Pattinsons Jacob fall in love as they must. That they make an implausible pair has less to do with the age gap between the two actors -- shes hardly cougar material yet but Witherspoon has a decade on her young co-star -- than with the fact that perky and mopey dont mix. Witherspoon has done all kinds of intelligent work since her notable debut in The Man in the Moon and she may yet make some imaginative choices when middle age puts paid to her ingenue looks. At 35 though shes still stranded somewhere between the hyperachieving class president she played in Election (her finest role to date) and the lesser variations on Legally Blonde of recent years. Witherspoon makes an incongruously squeaky Marlena and it doesnt help that Pattinson is about as ardently expressive as a log of wood trying to pass itself off as James Dean. Hal Holbrook has more fun in his bookend cameos playing Jacob as a rheumy-eyed old man telling his story. The only one bringing serious energy to the proceedings is Waltz doing a slightly watered-down version of the uber-Nazi he played in Quentin Tarantinos Inglourious Basterds. And even hes trying to squeeze idiosyncrasy out of a Svengali whos as off-the-rack as the rest of the ensemble -- which includes (sigh) an angry dwarf an oversexed high-wire artist with designs on Jacob a kindly old drunk and the usual broken-nosed goons who in this instance specialize in throwing obsolete employees off the circus train. The expertly staged climax in which all manner of caged creatures human and animal cut loose from their bonds comes as a relief from the endless inert scenes of forbidden romance. Rosie is good fun as far as cute elephants go and its nice I suppose that when the going gets rough she can go rogue in the service of gallantry. But it made me squirm that a movie with a love-conquers-all message includes the injunction that we must be kind to animals not because they are living beings but because they can be induced by pricey Hollywood wranglers to perform tricks -- like chugging back whiskey-laced lemonade or flirting with hunky movie stars -- that remake them in our image.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 22 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Under a big top stuffed with clownish villainy and death-defying romance and a menagerie of beasts human or otherwise Water for Elephants is quite the three-ring circus of a flick. When the tent folds and the dust settles the question is not whether the movie is good - sorry not a chance - but whether its garish enough sappy enough Hollywood enough to rise to the level of being likeably bad. Is it in short a guilty pleasure? Answer forthcoming. Movies Water for Elephants The official trailer For those unfamiliar with best-seller lists the source is Sara Gruens operatic novel although screenwriter Richard LaGravenese has conflated a couple of key characters while still mimicking the books methods - mounting the story as an extended flashback inside a present-day frame complete with an aged narrator to kick-start the reminiscence. Now LaGraveneses talents are highly valued in certain circles the ones with a reverence for the likes of The Horse Whisperer and The Bridges of Madison County. Those same circles will likely be untroubled by that fact that his structure robs the yarn of some suspense - our heros fate is known from the outset - even as it promises a climactic ""disaster"" of historic proportions. Big talk - well see about that. Quickly the flashback returns us to 1931 where Jacob (Robert Pattinson) is a veterinary student at Cornell University when his parents die in a car wreck a tragedy that leaves him in an instant orphaned and homeless. Naturally he rides the rails hopping a train one dark night and waking the next morning to discover this is no ordinary choo-choo. Seems that Jacob has accidentally run away to join the circus - the Benzini Bros. Circus to be precise not exactly in the class of the Ringling siblings but a going concern nonetheless. Or as Jacob so poetically puts it after sneaking a peek at the unfurled canvas and the acrobats and high-flyers and tight-rope walkers and especially the beautiful Marlena on her white steed ""They created heaven in one day."" Director Francis Lawrence works even faster. With a cinematographic assist from Rodrigo Prieto he manages to instantly recreate the Depression as a sun-dappled set-dressed gold-burnished slice of paradise. Tough times never looked so good. Still in these early frames theres fun to be had when the lens pokes (albeit discreetly) into heavens underbelly - the strippers beckoning the men folk into a private tent the tainted meat fed to the caged animals the toothless lion thats all roar and no bite. Fun too is Christoph Waltz as the scariest cat in the place. His August is the owner ringleader top con artist and yes another inglorious bastard a psychotic mix of snake charm and undiluted menace whose idea of corporate downsizing is to toss any extraneous labour right off the speeding train. Oh hes also Marlenas husband. Were led to believe that lovely Marlena is a product of countless foster homes a school-of-hard-knocks grad plucked off the mean streets by August and invited into a marriage of mutual convenience and its hinted kinky sex. Well all thats a tad difficult to credit given the amusingly miscast presence of Reese Witherspoon who much like the Depression is shot to resemble a sunny innocent with just the cutest freckles on her pert little nose. Then again innocents do attract which helps to explain the budding romance with boyish Jacob. Hired on as the circus vet he bonds with Marlena over her stricken horsie and later they make up an amorous threesome with the real star of the show. That would be Rosie the elephant an amiable behemoth who boasts freckles of her own and a pachyderms knack for stealing every scene shes in. You gotta love Rosie. Some segments of the audience will probably love Pattinson too. Indeed stripped of his vampiric duties in Twilight and playing the quietly observant type he acquits himself relatively well at least up to the point when the quiet is broken with dialogue like ""Youre a beautiful woman you deserve a beautiful life"". As for that pledged ""disaster"" at the climax it seemed woefully anti-climactic to these skeptical eyes. Of course skepticism is precisely what any visit to the circus demands that you leave behind. Which brings me back to the opening question. The elephant in the picture is obvious but the one in the room is harder to quantify Does the sheer Hollywood hoopla - hunky young Pattinson histrionic Waltz Witherspoon haloed in back-lighting Rosie doing head-stands the Depression making nice - add up to a perversely enjoyable brand of something that can be loosely called entertainment? I think it does. More important for the sake of the tinsel in Tinseltown I know it must.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post What fans of Sara Gruens best seller ""Water for Elephants"" will make of the big-screen adaptation of the big-top romance we cant say. Though if they find transcendent moments in the entertaining film starring Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson it will be because they brought them into the theater and projected them onto the screen. ""Water For Elephants"" is not to borrow the Benzini Bros. Circus motto -- ""the most spectacular show on Earth."" But it is a class act. Directed by Francis Lawrence and shot with smooth assurance by the gifted cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto ""Water for Elephants"" makes for an engaging couple of hours of old-fashioned narrative rhythms and star shine with Witherspoon Pattinson and Christoph Waltz as its doomed love triangle. And a stipple-faced elephant named Rosie who may save a faltering circus is riveting. Beneath the familiar movie comforts however are more contemporary notions about beastly behavior animal rights and human wrongs which screenwriter Richard LaGravenese doesnt overstate. Things begin with charm. An old man portrayed by national treasure Hal Holbrook stands outside a circus in a nighttime rain. When the circus manager (Paul Schneider) invites him in while he figures out what to do with the guy he begins telling him the story of the Benzini Circus and its fateful year 1931. ""Water for Elephants"" benefits immediately from Holbrooks casting. When his voice yields to Pattinsons narration the younger Jacob Jankow- ski already has our sympathies and a gentle authority. A good thing. Because the ""Twilight"" franchises sulky vampire often seems too wan to shoulder the weight of a grown-up tale. Yet Jacobs appreciative smile and sloe-eyed yearning make him a fine fit for the second-generation Polish immigrant who on the eve of graduating from veterinary school suffers a family tragedy. Reeling Jacob finds himself a stowaway on a train of circus roustabouts and big-tent acts lorded over by August (Waltz) and headlined by his wife Marlena (Witherspoon). Waltz is a disarming performer. His August disquiets. He is cruel explosive and charismatic. Waltz knows how to mix charm and sadism. In 2010 he won the Oscar for his portrayal of a Nazi in ""Inglourious Basterds."" And August has something of Col. Hans Landas ooze. But hes also broken. He invites wary sympathy then thrashes it. Suffering courses through ""Water for Elephants."" How could it be otherwise? Its the Depression. Like Jacob men rush the circus train for work. When the crowds dont come they can be tossed literally. And its an old-style circus. Lions tigers and other animals are caged and maltreated. But theyre not the only ones trapped. Irish actor Jim Norton is quietly winning as Camel a Benzini veteran who knows how unforgiving the work -- and the boss -- can be. It takes too long for Witherspoons Marlena to become more than a pretty face beneath a headful of platinum curls. Late in the film she tells Jacob she felt like she came into the world ""a passenger on a train."" ""Water for Elephants"" would have been a finer movie if this werent an apt description of Witherspoons place beneath this big top.

By Peter Rainer Film critic April 22 2011 Save for later Saved Robert Pattinson (l.) and Reese Witherspoon are shown in a scene from the film Water for Elephants. David James/Twentieth Century Fox/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Its one thing to make a movie set in the Depression-era 1930s but ""Water For Elephants"" based on the Sara Gruen bestseller often looks as if it was made in the 1930s. This is not altogether a bad thing. The film has a pleasing retro-ness that often mitigates the dullness.Jacob (Robert Pattinson) is a Cornell veterinary student who following a family tragedy ends up joining a traveling circus presided over by the autocratic August (Christoph Waltz). Augusts wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) is its star attraction. Even if you havent read the book you can see where this is going.Marlena is first glimpsed by the agog Jacob atop her magnificent white show horse. She is beholden to August because he plucked her from poverty but she cant mistake Jacobs barely banked ardor for her. Neither can August. Since August is often cruel not only to his circus people but to his animals its only a matter of time - too much time - before he and Jacob square off. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Director Francis Lawrence and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese wisely resist the urge to get all fancy and Felliniesque about the hardscrabble circus life. But the Depression that we see is a bit too gussied up and commemorative. People in this movie arent starving just hungry. (An infusion of Walker Evans-style pictorialism would have better set the mood.) Likewise Marlena given her background isnt hard-bitten enough. We should be able to see in her communions with both August and Jacob a survivor with an eye for the main chance. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? In Pictures African elephants Pattinson seems at home here maybe because hes relieved at not having to play a vampire for a change. That role literally almost goes to Waltz who confirms the gift for preening nastiness that had its fullest flower in ""Inglourious Basterds.""The best films best performance though comes from Rosie the elephant trained by Jacob and maimed by August. She has expert timing knows how to listen to the other actors wails convincingly and uses her trunk with aplomb. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for moments of intense violence and sexual content.)

Involving a handsome young veterinarian a pretty lady who does tricks atop horses the ladys volatile abusive husband whos also the circus owner and ringmaster and an elephant who understands commands in Polish? With colorful narrative assets like these Sara Gruens best-selling historical novel Water for Elephants has always unspooled in the minds eye like a good old-fashioned movie. Only now look Up on the big screen heres Robert Pattinson as veterinary student Jacob Jankowski brought as if by fate into the hubbub of the Benzini Brothers traveling circus Heres Reese Witherspoon as Marlena the sparkling star attraction Heres Inglourious Basterds Christoph Waltz as Marlenas husband August the dangerous impresario Heres the lovable elephant And yet something is wrong under this big tent. Actually made to resemble a good old-fashioned crowd-pleasing movie this cinematic Water for Elephants droops and lumbers like Rosie the elephant herself. Its odd the anemia of this production directed by Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) from a squared-off script by screenwriter Richard LaGravanese (The Horse Whisperer). Inevitably the movie veers from the novel in various small to medium ways but not so much that a bookworm would complain. The heart of the story is there how Jacobs life changes after his parents die in a car accident how he finds his way to the Benzini Brothers how August is even crueler to his circus animals than he is to his wife and how the tense triangle of Jacob Marlena and August leads to a dramatic climax. Instead whats missing is the soul. From scene to scene and plot point to plot point nothing connects. Pattinson Witherspoon and Waltz perform in separate rings of their three-ring circus. Pattinson his sleepy-eyed handsomeness styled in the manner of a 30s matinee idol looks very manly and elegant even when hes glistening with grimy sweat and shoveling animal droppings. He gives Jacob an interesting air of watchfulness and reserve. Meanwhile over in her own corner dolled up in platinum curls big eyelashes and sparkly body-hugging showgirl leotards Witherspoon interprets Marlena as part bored trophy-wife part hard showbiz pro and part lost little girl. None of which allows for much romantic chemistry between the two actors. Waltz in his spotlight bites into his role with an almost manic energy that turns August into more of a cartoon villain than someone spurred to cruelty by tormenting psychological complications. (In the book another character diagnoses August as a paranoid schizophrenic.) The ringmaster might as well be twirling a mustache or tying Marlena to a railroad tie so exaggerated is the Evil Face Waltz puts on before August slips into one of his episodes of brutality. Then the director not one for subtlety pulls in close for those Evil Face moments lest we miss the cue. Water for Elephants makes use of a framing device similar to one the screenwriter used for The Bridges of Madison County An old Jacob played by Hal Holbrook tells his story in flashback to a younger man who represents a new generation of circus operators. (In the book young Jacobs story is interspersed with scenes of old Jacob in a nursing home before the old guy leaves the home and finds his way to the young guys circus.) From a practical standpoint those Holbrook bookends are a tried-and-true movie solution to unwrapping a picture and then tying it up neatly at the end with maximum heartstring tugs. But from a ""step right up and see the show"" standpoint Water for Elephants should have sent in the clowns.

In supporting roles are a talented elephant and a blonde woman who is a let me check my press notes a yes Reese Witherspoon. The film begins with a bathetic Titanic-style gimmick Jacob a watery-eyed old coot (Hal Holbrook) is telling his story to a young carny his crackly treacle abruptly segueing into Robert Pattinsons earnest monotone circa 1931. Mom and Dad die and he can no longer afford college so Jacob hops a train and finds himself in a car of the Benzini Bros. circus. He falls for their star showgirl (Witherspoon) and clashes with her monstrous husband (Christoph Waltz). Mostly though he models outfits including a suspiciously contemporary leather jacket. The worlds most famous vampire is curiously toothless as the kindhearted parentless animal-loving veterinarian-wannabe Jacob (Team Jacob) a sensitive soul not meant for this cruel world and clearly engineered for some tweens scrapbook. His two defining traits? He likes animals and thinks mean people suck. In keeping with the oddly pristine Depression-era circus he joins Jacobs rough edges are entirely cosmetic Hes stubbled not stirred. Emotional range would be wasted however. The camera doesnt so much propel the story forward as orbit Pattinsons head like a reverent CAT scan. Even when Jacob is bludgeoned and beaten the fake blood is artfully applied the better to enhance his chiseled features. In fact Pattinsons beauty crowds out just about everything else. The gifted elephant is mostly seen as a Gaussian blur of crackled skin. The carnies are wallpaper either loyal sidekicks or vicious meanies. Most unexpected Reese Witherspoon one of Hollywoods most bankable stars plays little more than a simpleton victim a wisp in satin costumes. Her few lines could fit into a peanut shell. As her cartoonishly evil ringmaster husband Waltz offers a limp variation on his Oscar-winning performance in Inglourious Basterds. Three years before Water for Elephants takes place Charlie Chaplin released The Circus another romance about a man who woos a horse-riding showgirl while attempting to rescue her from an abusive ringmaster. That films unforgettable final shot -- Chaplin sashaying into the horizon with an indefatigable little skip in his step -- was poignant because the cockeyed Tramp had just watched his love fall for a bland tightrope-walking jock named Rex whose main virtues were his jawline tailored tux and vanity. Eighty-odd years later Hollywood seems to have learned exactly the wrong lesson Ditch the Tramp keep Rex.

"Water for Elephants review Modern stars working without a net in this old-fashioned melodrama |       NJ.com comments Water for Elephants review Modern stars working without a net in this old-fashioned melodrama Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on April 22 2011 at 808 AM View/Post Comments David JamesJacob (Robert Pattinson) and Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) grow closer amidst formidable obstacles. ""Water for Elephants"" is the sort of big-top melodrama that would have been a huge hit in the early 30s with Jean Harlow as the tough bareback rider and Clark Gable as the handsome roustabout. Except this is 2011 and so instead we get Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson. Theres no way around that of course; this is a modern film and must be made with modern stars. Still the point is that the old stars knew how to take a performance as far as it could go. They understood broad strokes and werent afraid to use them. These actors -- particularly Pattinson -- hold back. They seem shy almost embarrassed by the material and that holds us back too. The story based on the best-seller is certainly a ripe one -- all about Jacob a young veterinary student who suddenly bankrupted takes to the rails and takes up with a circus where he falls for the star performer. Literary types can try hard to make something of the allusions to another Jacob who also wandered from tent to tent but thats a distraction from the drama and the triangle formed by our hero the flashy Marlena and her husband the jealous ringmaster August. Movie Review Water for Elephants (PG-13) Fox (122 min.) Directed by Francis Lawrence. With Reese Witherspoon Robert Pattinson Christoph Waltz. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains violence animal cruelty alcohol abuse and sexual situations. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS That old conflict plays well and its probably not due to director Francis Lawrence. He also made the awful ""I Am Legend"" and ""Constantine"" and all hes done here is replace his usual visual excesses with thick layers of wall-to-wall music. More credit probably goes to veteran screenwriter Richard LaGravanese whos always had a touch for strong female characters (""The Bridges of Madison County"" ""Living Out Loud""). While the dialogue occasionally falters (did people in 1931 really say things like ""That was cool"") the situations ring true. Still although Christoph Waltz gets to indulge his taste for attractive atrocious villainy as August the leads are out of their depth. Witherspoon comes off best but shes playing someone whos been knocked around a bit and toughened up in response. She should have a shell as hard as an old peanut; instead Witherspoons soft as cotton candy. Pattinson is more of a problem. Hes a tall handsome young man and its a good thing to see him away from the ""Twilight"" saga with his hair finally combed and all that glitter washed off his face. But hes still mopey and meandering and well bloodless. That passivity is fine for a fantasy aimed at tweens (and showed some signs of change in the last installment) but a grown-up leading man needs more charm and challenge to him. Yet given a great corny line like ""Youre a beautiful woman -- you deserve a beautiful life"" Pattinson doesnt know what to do with it. Gable of course would have sunk his teeth into it. And thats the difference between an old movie made in 1931 and a new movie made about 1931. And part of the reason the not-quite-there ""Water for Elephants"" is one ring short of a three-ring hit.

Sony Pictures Classics By Joe Morgenstern Updated April 22 2011 1201 a.m. ET This is the film that should have won an Oscar in its foreign-language category this year and didnt. Its languages are French and Arabic but theres nothing foreign about its substance or its shattering impact. Denis Villeneuves screen adaptation of a play by the Lebanese-Canadian playwright Wajdi Mouawad tells a story--masterfully--of courage cruelty family mysteries and a chain of anger that can only be broken by love. Watch a clip from the film Incendies courtesy Sony Pictures Classics ""Incendies"" which means ""scorched"" starts with a dramatic device worthy of Agatha Christie (and ends with one worthy of Sophocles.) A Montreal notary summons the twin children of a recently deceased woman from the Middle East for the reading of her will. The twins Jeanne and Simon arent surprised about the distribution of their mothers modest estate; its to be divided equally between them. But theyre astonished when the notary hands them a pair of envelopes for delivery--one to the father theyd assumed was dead the other to a brother theyd never heard of. To find these shadowy figures Jeanne followed later by her brother Simon embarks on a Middle Eastern odyssey thats intercut with the story of their mother Nawal; she is brought back to life in a glorious grand-operatic performance by Lubna Azabal. The actress and the role deserve each other in the best way. Nawal grows from a passionate girl in a backward village to a college student a nonviolent activist for peace a violent activist for peace and then a prisoner so ruthlessly brutalized by her captors that she becomes known as La Femme Qui Chante the woman who sings through her pain to keep her sanity. The film was shot in Jordan--Andre Turpin did the inspired cinematography--though the locales arent specified; indeed the country isnt named. Nevertheless Nawals life is clearly intertwined with the agonies of Lebanon that culminated in a Christian militias massacre of Palestinian refugees in 1982. And it doesnt matter that the logic of the warfare may be difficult to decode. What ""Incendies"" sets forth so powerfully is the biblical nature of sectarian violence--retribution leading endlessly to more of the same--and Nawals struggle to live a principled life in its midst. The ending literally derives from Sophocles with all that implies of drama heightened--sometimes uncomfortably--to the level of myth. Its all the more remarkable then that Mr. Villeneuve and his superb cast keep the action grounded in the moment-to-moment realities of the siblings quest--of the detective story really--as they cross the chasm that separates generations and slowly discover who their mother was. Jeanne is played by Melissa Desormeaux-Poulin and Simon by Maxim Gaudette. Remy Girard is the notary in a film that makes a compelling case in passing for the role that notaries have played over the centuries in keeping historical records and tracing family connections. Watch a clip from the film Water For Elephants courtesy 20th Century Fox starring Reese Witherspoon and Robert Pattinson Water for Elephants How do I count the ways this movie goes wrong? Maybe by starting with the pictorial rightness of a circus train pulling into town in Depression-era America Rodrigo Prietos cinematography gives the whole production an evocative beauty that it never earns dramatically. The circus of ""Water For Elephants"" isnt supposed to be the Greatest Show on Earth but it might be expected to resemble the exuberantly tawdry microcosm of Sara Gruens novel with its fiery lovers fascinating freaks unregenerate brutes and a menagerie dominated by a fancy-dancing linguist of an elephant named Rosie. So much for expectations. These lovers Robert Pattinsons Jacob and Reese Witherspoons Marlena generate less heat than a naphtha stove. These freaks are noted only glancingly. (The fat lady doesnt get to talk let alone sing.) The brutes have been combined into one bipolar monster that a surpassingly subtle actor Christoph Waltz (the Nazi colonel of ""Inglourious Basterds"") has been directed to play coarsely. And the director Francis Lawrence--working from a screenplay by Richard LaGravenese--blows the moment when Jacob finds the key to Rosies behavior What was a magical discovery in the book becomes a mildly intriguing plot point. ENLARGE Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon in Water for Elephants. Twentieth Century Fox The film starts going wrong in a ""Titanic""-like prologue with Hal Holbrook as the aged Jacob looking back on his life. His performance is too big the camera is too close the scene is being sold to the audience instead of offered to it. But thats nothing compared to the too-muchness of Mr. Waltzs evil ringmaster August and the too-manyness of the doting closeups devoted to Mr. Pattinson who does far more reacting than acting in a movie that keeps insisting on the obvious. Its a tiny point but that insistence even infects the moment when Marlena finds herself a ladder in order to climb aboard Rosie for the first time. ""Can you help me with this ladder?"" she asks Jacob as if he might not recognize a tall narrow thing with lots of rungs. Meeks Cutoff Kelly Reichardts marvelous minimalist epic which is entering national distribution this week amounts to a master class in the power of observation. Much of the action--the outward action since a lot goes on in peoples heads--is seen and barely heard in long shots. The pace matches that of the characters three families in a wagon train moving slowly toward Oregon in 1845. (At least the families hope theyre headed for Oregon since their guide a mountain man named Stephen Meek has taken them on an unmarked path and theyve lost their way.) Yet you watch with unswerving attention. ENLARGE Shirley Henderson Zoe Kazan and Michelle Williams in Meeks Cutoff. Oscilloscope Laboratories Meek who is played with layered extravagance by Bruce Greenwood is part of the reason the movie is intrinsically dramatic. Is Meek to be trusted or is he the blowhard he seems increasingly to be? But the other component of Jon Raymonds brilliant script presents an equally fateful alternative--an Indian wanderer who may lead the pioneers to the water they must find or to their deaths at the hands of his unseen tribesmen. Insisting on nothing ""Meeks Cutoff"" operates on faith in our concern for understated yet complex issues of trust fear empathy ignorance versus evil the mystery of authority and the role of The Other in an encounter between civilizations. Ms. Reichardt conveys all of this with her own serene authority. The flawless cast includes Michelle Williams Will Patton Paul Dano Shirley Henderson Zoe Kazan and Rod Rondeaux. Christopher Blauvelt did the cinematography which is luminous by day and mysteriously dark by night. Jeff Grace composed the score an austere symphony of woozy swoops. POM Wonderful Presents The Greatest Movie Ever Sold Morgan Spurlock has come up with a terrific idea--a movie about product placements that depends completely on product placements for its financing. He admits from the get-go that hes selling out then insists that such transparency proves his integrity. The full title gives POM Wonderful its own line because the makers of the pricey pomegranate elixir paid 1 million for above-the-title naming rights. (Hats off to them not only for getting the joke but helping promulgate it.) Most of the movies substance consists of Mr. Spurlocks campaign to find backers--hes an engaging pitchman--but he also discusses matters of ethics (while slugging down bottles of POM Wonderful) with such deep thinkers as Noam Chomsky and Donald Trump and with Ralph Nader who warns that ""you can satirize and spoof yourself out of your objective."" Its good advice but Mr. Spurlock doesnt need it. He spoofs himself into an exuberant documentary that demonstrates the all-pervasive influence of modern advertising by satiric example and with great ingenuity--talking for example about product placement while hes placed in such products as a JetBlue terminal (where he slugs down a bottle of POM Wonderful.) During the course of the film he helps us understand why school districts like the one in Floridas Broward County stoop to selling ad space on their vehicles and fences (they know theyre bending though they dont consider it stooping.) Toward the end he favors Mr. Nader with a pair of Merrell shoes. In the interests of transparency I should say that I left the screening with a swag bag full of placed products and used one of them Mane n Tail shampoo on my hair the following morning. Although Mane n Tail was originally developed for horses I cant tell you how clean it left me feeling. In Brief Jeanne the single mother at the center of ""Fly Away"" lives with incipient crisis. Her teenage daughter Mandy (Ashley Rickards) is autistic and that incipience can give way to utter chaos without warning. Janet Grillos modestly produced feature breaks no new ground in depicting those who live with autism--both the afflicted and their loved ones. So much is so familiar--the sudden terrors the financial pressure the beckoning prospect of institutionalization the unanswerable question of how to have a life of ones own while caring for an autistic child. But Beth Brodericks lovely portrayal illuminates Jeannes loneliness and the steadfastness of her love.    Cy Harvey who died last weekend at the age of 85 opened my eyes and lots of others to foreign films. Along with Bryant Haliday his partner in the Brattle Theatre off Harvard Square he founded Janus Films the distribution company that introduced a generation of Americans half a century ago to the work of such directors as Ingmar Bergman Francois Truffaut Jean-Luc Godard Federico Fellini and Akira Kurosawa. While its hard to recall what the film scene was like before Janus its easy to remember the thrill of discovering the companys releases. The Roman god Janus faced two ways but Janus the distributor taught me to look only one way--forward with anticipation. ENLARGE DVD FOCUS Caramel (2007) Once known as the Paris of the Middle East Beirut isnt all bombings and political upheavals. Nadine Labakis beguiling debut feature a small-scale comedy of sisterhood is comprised of urgent intimate vignettes about five women who meet at or work at a Beirut beauty salon called Si Belle. All but one of the actresses who play them are nonprofessionals--not unprofessional just untrained in the craft--and they are to a woman enchanting. (The film takes its title from a sticky mixture used in Lebanon as a depilatory.) Ms. Labaki the professional plays Si Belles owner. Horton Hears a Who (2008) Jim Carrey is the voice of Horton the elephant in this animated feature from Blue Sky Studios the company thats currently flying high with a blue macaw named Rio. The film turns enchanting when it plunges from the jungle of Nool into the cheerful pandemonium of Who-ville the microscopic civilization atop the white speck that Horton finds perched on a pink clover blossom. (Chuck Jones did a TV version of the Dr. Seuss classic in 1970.) The voice cast includes Steve Carell Carol Burnett Will Arnett Amy Poehler Seth Rogen Jonah Hill Dan Fogler and Isla Fisher. Super Size Me (2004) Morgan Spurlock took on the fast-food industry--and took the measure of this nations obesity--by eating three meals a day only at McDonalds for one month pigging out on the full caloric sweep of the chains menu and agreeing to have orders supersized whenever a counter clerk asked. The result was a substantial weight gain surprise surprise; a spike in blood cholesterol and a likable documentary that puts American portion control in vivid perspective. The only other movie to do that more graphically is ""WallE"" with its extraplanetary leisure world of grotesque waddlers. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Starring Robert Pattinson Reese Witherspoon James Frain Christoph Waltz Hal Holbrook Paul Schneider Ken Foree Tim Guinee Mark Povinelli Scott MacDonald Director Francis Lawrence Running time 200 Release Opened Apr 22 2011  Editorial Review Theres a sucker for love born every minuteBy Michael OSullivanFriday April 22 2011Like the circus that provides the setting for Sara Gruens best-selling novel ""Water for Elephants"" the movie based on that 2006 book is big slick and showy. (Step right up for heartthrob Robert Pattinson Prepare to be amazed by Oscar winners Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz See them interact with an actual elephant) It is also undeniably effective entertainment.The standout among its star attractions is the Austrian-born Waltz as the mercurial-to-the-point-of-psychopathic August Rosenbluth. In the book his character was the head animal trainer of the Depression-era Benzini Brothers Circus where the action takes place. In Richard LaGravaneses mostly respectful adaptation August has been elevated to owner ringmaster and trainer. The promotion suits Waltz -- who tears into the part and his characters flat American dialect -- with all the relish and surgical precision of a starving man in front of a plate of chicken wings. Waltz does everything but lick his fingers in the juicy role which calls for the same high-wire mix of charm and insanity he demonstrated in ""Inglourious Basterds."" Hes a thrilling performer to watch.It is August who hires the films narrator Jacob Jankowski (Pattinson) a student of veterinary medicine forced to drop out of Cornell and join the circus just shy of final exams when his parents are killed. And it is August who is married to the ravishing circus performer Marlena (Witherspoon) who catches Jacobs eye. Needless to say with August around thats not a good thing.But their attraction is also the most predictable thing about ""Water"" which like a well-rehearsed circus animal occasionally has thefeeling that its merely going through the motions. You know where the thing is headed. Still its fun to watch.Fortunately the movie like the book has other things going for it. In addition to being a tale of star-crossed lovers its also both a young mans coming-of-age saga and a fairly fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse at the seedy side of early-20th-century showmanship. The flies manure and slop are plentiful here as is the mistreatment of animals that August engages in. That enrages Jacob and along with his growing affection for Marlena it fuels his inevitable clash with August. But it makes the film at times hard to stomach especially for the more sensitive animal lovers.Visually the film is a handsome thing. With the help of production designer Jack Fisk (""There Will Be Blood"") filmmaker Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") conjures a mostly believable world circa 1931 of acrobats sideshow entertainers clowns and roustabouts down on their luck. You wont ever forget that youre watching a show but its a highly watchable show nonetheless. If anything suffers in the translation from page to screen its the coming-of-age component of the story. As LaGravanese shifts Jacob and Marlenas romance into the center ring -- and really did you think it would be any other way? -- his script soft-pedals the theme of disillusionment that the idealistic Jacob experiences. That theme that fakery and cruelty underlie a world of wonder and beauty is still there but it shines more dimly next to the spotlighted love story. In his meatiest major-studio role outside the ""Twilight"" canon Pattinson acquits himself well. Witherspoon conveys Marlenas complex relationship to August -- one hovering between dependence and fear -- with her usual openheartedness. ""To talent and illusion"" says August at one point offering a toast to what matters in the circus. It also matters in Hollywood. And theres just enough of each of those qualities to make ""Water for Elephants"" if not the greatest show on Earth at least a pretty good one.Contains some obscenity brief sensuality violence and scenes of cruelty toward animals.

Photo Usually you have to wait for the end-of-the-year awards season to see an elaborate period piece that fails as spectacularly as ""Water for Elephants."" This clunky plodding romantic circus melodrama showcases the improbable less-than-scintillating triangle of Reese Witherspoon Robert Pattinson and Christoph Waltz. My heart began to sink with the contemporary prologue when an old man named Jacob (Hal Holbrook) launches into a gloomy series of flashbacks beginning with the death of his Polish-born parents in a 1931 car crash. Left penniless and now played by a sulking Pattinson Jacob drops out of his veterinary studies at Cornell and for no apparent reason hops a circus train. PHOTOS REESE WITHERSPOONS LEADING MEN VIDEO SAVE THE ELEPHANTS After a brief stint shoveling manure Jacob is named staff veterinarian by August (Waltz) the sadistic desperate owner of the struggling circus. Ordered by his boss to tend to a seriously ailing horse that Augusts wife Marlena (Witherspoon) rides bareback on Jacob euthanizes the animal instead. Though August is given to expressing his displeasure -- and saving money -- by frequently having staff members tossed off moving trains he instead assigns Jacob to a new star attraction hes acquired a performing elephant named Rosie. August nearly kills Rosie in a rage after she throws Marlena. But our hero discovers the big animal responds just fine to his kindness -- and commands in Polish. Meanwhile Marlena and Jacob are batting their eyelashes at each other and August is beginning to get suspicious particularly after Jacob rescues his wife during a speakeasy raid. Richard LaGraveneses wobbly adaptation of Sara Gruens novel lumbers along even more slowly than the elephant and is full of stilted dialogue -- not to mention such weary stereotypes as dying old-timers and helpful midgets. While theres some nice train footage and incidental color director Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") achieves at best a shaky sense of time and place -- New York State during the Great Depression. Overall it makes sleazy circus world look way too pretty. The anti-climactic climax a big-top disaster is so confusingly staged and edited that its hard to figure out exactly whats going on. Some of this could be more easily overlooked if the stars any semblance of romantic chemistry which they dont. A miscast Witherspoon seems equally uncomfortable as a femme fatale or as a circus performer. Pattinson of the ""Twilight"" movies never manages to suggest Jacob has any kind of inner life -- the elephant is more expressive. Pattinsons scenes with Witherspoon have no heat whatsoever. Waltz so entertaining in ""Inglourious Basterds"" has been encouraged to ham it up mercilessly as the heavy. But he never conveys any serious sense of menace. ""Water For Elephants"" is less fun than any circus movie Ive ever seen -- and Ive seen lots. Maybe they should send in the clowns. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Producers of Spider-Man musical open up Read Next Producers of Spider-Man musical open up Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46694 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 22725 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 16495 16 dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

David James Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon in ""Water for Elephants."" (AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox David James) A movie like a circus relies on hundreds of unseen laborers who create for us an illusion of danger romance or amusement. The most rewarding way to watch ""Water for Elephants"" is to focus on the sideshow of costumes and craftsmanship because the romance in the center ring smells like trained animals going through the motions.The story is told in flashback as an old man named Jacob Jankowski (Hal Holbrook) visits a traveling circus and recounts his own adventures beneath the bigtop. Circa 1930 young Jacob (Robert Pattinson) drops out of veterinary school when his parents die and hitches a ride on a circus train. His education makes him valuable to the Teutonic ringmaster August (Christoph Waltz) and to Augusts acrobat wife Marlene (Reese Witherspoon). But inevitably Jacob falls in love with Marlene and all hell breaks loose -- or rather (spoiler alert) all the animals do in a savage finale thats almost worth the price of admission.Emphasis on ""almost."" Although its a story about forbidden passions and freakish marvels its basically a chaste entertainment to pass the time between ""Twilight"" movies.As usual Pattinsons acting consists of shaking his head and whimpering. (He only truly smiles when he is dolled up in a hootchie-kootcihe outfit or covered in cream pies.) Waltz an Oscar winner for ""Inglourious Basterds"" musters some menace as the betrayed husband and Witherspoon looks lovely in a leotard atop the titular pachyderm who is the most effective actor is the cast. But ""Water for Elephants"" feeds us peanuts when we hunger for some red meat.

(David James/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday April 22 2011 400 AM Title Water for Elephants With Robert Pattinson Reese Witherspoon. Romantic drama about a runaway who finds love in a 1930s circus. Director Francis Lawrence (202). PG-13 Violence language sexuality. At area theaters.Worth the price of admission but lacking in high-flying feats ""Water for Elephants"" is a solemnly faithful rendering of Sara Gruens book-club favorite. Director Francis Lawrence and writer Richard LaGravenese replicate just enough of the novels fantasy to keep audiences involved even if the results hardly add up to the most spectacular show at the cineplex.The primary drawback is the lack of chemistry between the leads Reese Witherspoon and ""Twilights"" Robert Pattinson. Pattinson plays Jacob a veterinary student who hits the rails in 1931 after a family tragedy. He happens to hop a traveling circus train and is instantly enamored of the star act Marlena (Witherspoon) and her dancing ponies. So far so blah.But into this ordinary world leaps an electrifying ringleader Christoph Waltz. As the circus owner -- and Marlenas husband -- his August is a desperate brute whose smooth exterior barely hides a jealous sociopath. Impressed by Jacobs Ivy League education he hires the young stowaway to train the animals. When Jacob and the beautiful Marlena start working closely together on a new elephant act however his suspicions are (rightly) aroused.Pattinson is such a passive actor that he needs a strong partner to reflect some depth into his brooding beauty. Witherspoon stiff and withholding isnt it. She seems as lost as he does and Waltzs confident exaggerated showmanship makes them both look like hesitant kids.Fortunately theres enough going on at the edges to distract us from the main event. Lawrence takes great care to convey the 1930s feel and does capture some of the books poignant vision of a tattered era.In addition to Waltz -- an Oscar winner for ""Inglourious Basterds"" -- several supporting actors make a memorable impact. The most notable is Hal Holbrook as the aged Jacob who remembers the story in flashback.In just a few minutes he locates the romance that once inspired dreamers to run away with the circus. Depending on how your day is going he might even convince you to consider it too.

"Rosie is great but Water for Elephants stalls - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Rosie is great but Water for Elephants stalls By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated | | Share Reprints amp; Permissions A middle-aged circus elephant with a taste for booze steals the show in the movie adaptation of Sara Gruens best-selling novel Water for Elephants. 20th Century Fox Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) and Jacob (Robert Pattinson) share an affection for Rosie who performs in a circus whose owner beats animals. EnlargeClose 20th Century Fox Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) and Jacob (Robert Pattinson) share an affection for Rosie who performs in a circus whose owner beats animals. This old-fashioned melodrama about a romance set amid the big top is mildly entertaining though the best performances come not from the stars but the supporting players. Hal Holbrook is superb as the elderly incarnation of circus veterinarian Jacob Jankowksi. His performance is so nuanced that his youthful persona played by Robert Pattinson seems all the more hollow. Pattinsons performance is sometimes likable but too often he wears a glazed expression. His love interest Reese Witherspoon as Marlena does her best to fill in his blanks with her charisma. But their romance lacks sparks. Their attraction evolves after veterinary student Jacob hops a traveling circus train after a family tragedy. Marlena is the circus star performer. She is glamorous graceful and married to the owner/ringmaster August (Christoph Waltz). Waltzs sadistic character feels related to the Nazi he won an Oscar for in Inglourious Basterds. He believes that animals respond best to beatings and cruel prodding. About the movie Water for Elephants   1/2 out of fourStars Reese Witherspoon Robert Pattinson Christoph Waltz Hal Holbrook Jim Norton Paul Schneider Director Francis Lawrence Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG 13 for moments of intense violence and sexual content Running time 2 hours 2 minutes Opens Friday nationwide The story is bookended with Holbrooks Jacob reminiscing about his experience in a Prohibition-era traveling circus. After he hops the train a kindly worker named Camel (Jim Norton) introduces him to August and hes hired to tend to the animals. His job morphs into training Rosie the liquor-loving pachyderm on which Marlena performs acrobatic stunts. Recoiling from Augusts vicious treatment of the animals Marlena and Jacob bond over their mutual affection for her beloved horse and Rosie who understands Polish commands. The explanation for this while covered in the book is glossed over in the movie. Pattinson spends too much time looking vacantly moony-eyed. It is a relief though to see him smile instead of brooding in vampire fashion and sport a healthy glow rather than his Twilight pallor. Witherspoon brings more dimension to her character particularly in desperate scenes in which she pleads with and tries to placate Waltz. The script by Richard LaGravenese who is well-versed in adapting popular fiction such as Bridges of Madison County lacks the sparkle of his best work. Water for Elephants has some appealing elements of old-school Hollywood epics. The films production design by veteran Jack Fisk (There Will Be Blood Badlands) is one of its biggest assets. Fisk re-creates life in 1931 in vivid fashion. So detailed are the sets that you can almost smell the piles of dung and bales of hay.

Photo David James Twentieth Century Fox Water for Elephants review High-wire circus act 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Water for Elephants Drama. Starring Robert Pattinson Reese Witherspoon and Christoph Waltz. Directed by Francis Lawrence. (PG-13. 122 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Going into ""Water for Elephants"" the question was whether Robert Pattinson was more than the (unintentional) white-faced comic that he is in the ""Twilight"" series and whether he can hold his own at the center of a major feature. The answer is yes sure hes fine but thats not the big news coming out of this movie. The big news is Christoph Waltz namely that this remarkable actor is not doomed to be what some of us feared he might be after ""Inglourious Basterds"" someone who got a great chance once and then never again found a role worthy of his peculiar talent. In ""Water for Elephants"" Waltz plays a circus owner and ringleader during the Great Depression and when hes onscreen every eye is on him no matter who is talking. Among the extraordinary things about Waltz - aside from those things that elude analysis - is his ability to embody contradiction. He plays a complicated figure a man who controls other people but cant control himself who craves friendship but trusts no one who is childlike and murderous affectionate and sadistic at once reasonable and mad and capable of anything including generosity. Related Stories Water for Elephants Another actor might have just given us a moody guy but Waltz carries into every scene - virtually into every moment - the whole roiling package. This is why we look and keep looking because so much is going on internally that might express itself in action and so much about this person is engaging even as hes appalling. After ""Inglourious Basterds"" we could talk about a great performance. After ""Water for Elephants"" we can talk about a great actor. Based on the novel by Sara Gruen the story takes the form of a reminiscence by an old man who is played by Hal Holbrook - because if youre going to hire an old guy why not the best? As the old fellow Holbrook tells of what happened to him in the pivotal year of 1931 back when he was still young enough and dull enough to be played by Robert Pattinson. A veterinary student about to get his license to practice Jacob (Pattinson) experiences a series of catastrophic reversals that land him as an employee at a third-rate traveling circus. Director Francis Lawrence and his design team show us the era through a circus train full of grimy sleeper cars and people wearing the same clothes since last week a place where the employees like the shepherds in the Bible smell like the animals and belong nowhere else. This is not their last stop. Its their next-to-last stop and the last stop will be worse. In the very air of ""Water for Elephants"" is a quality of loss and desolation that makes us see the quick fixes of bootleg liquor and the distractions of forced merriment as all too human and sad. Against this background Reese Witherspoon as the equestrian main attraction and the wife of August (Waltz) probably should have stood out as the movies vision in white the one thing worth redeeming from this awful place. But something about Witherspoon seems too down to earth for romanticism and anything but a waif she hardly seems in need of rescue. This makes her an odd fit for the role and yet shes actress enough to make it work and to emphasize the most interesting thing about the character which is how she sees her husband - as someone sensitive and lost not just dangerous. ""Water for Elephants"" is a circus tale full of drunks tossed-off circus wisdom and forlorn animals including a beautiful elephant. The affectionate but turbulent dynamic among Waltz Pattinson and Witherspoon is endlessly watchable thanks mainly to Waltz (though he has to act those scenes with somebody). From Holbrook in the movies first minutes we know that some kind of disaster will strike before the finish and most of the movie consists of watching for it and looking for signs. Everyone will know exactly where to look. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

Director Francis Lawrence and screenwriter Richard LaGravenese marvelously compress Gruens book into two hours losing most of its modern-day sections but exquisitely retaining the Depression-era circus magic that Gruen evoked.Set mostly in 1931 Elephants focuses on narrator-protagonist Jacob (Pattinson) whose dreams of a veterinary career die when a family tragedy strikes. Left homeless and destitute Jacob hops aboard the Benzini Bros. Circus train where he narrowly escapes ""redlining"" -- being tossed off the train at breakneck speed. Some of the guys take pity on him though and the next morning he gets introduced to August (Christoph Waltz) the owner-ringmaster. Jacob also lays eyes on the comely Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) whose horse act is the shows star attraction -- and whos married to August. Therein lurks much much trouble.The movie boasts gorgeous cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto who captures both the glamour and grubbiness inherent in a traveling train circus along with sweeping vistas of choo-choos hurtling through the night (at one point I thoroughly expected to see Hogwarts looming up ahead) and rosily lit intimate encounters. Youll feel the townspeoples thrill as the big top is raised and the terror when it comes down in the big denouement.As the Jacobs young and old Pattinson and Hal Holbrook both delight although they never share the screen. Pattinson shows a lot of heretofore unsuspected acting ability. Thats especially so in the scenes where hes both falling in love with Marlena and starting to like her husband despite that look in Augusts eyes that makes you wonder if hes not really just a psychopath with a spiffy wardrobe.Pattinson proves adept at displaying barely suppressed rage; with just a hint of a squint and the twitch of a cheekbone he makes you believe that August had better watch his step. The always-brilliant Waltz seethes with violence but also brings unexpected humanity and pathos to August.The lovely talented Witherspoon is miscast as Marlena; she simply lacks the lush sensuality that the books Marlena has that makes you understand why Jacob (and August) would risk everything to keep her. Her acting is fine if a bit lackluster but one never quite gets that burning attraction.Also the costumes by Jacqueline West although meticulously period-correct do nothing for Witherspoons thin angular body. Surely the filmmakers could have whipped up something that would retain the period effect and still make their star look good. The sparkly show costumes particularly disappoint; they look as though Witherspoon ought to give them a good tug here and there to make them fit correctly.The other female lead however looks fabulous throughout. Rosie (her real name is Tai) an elephant that August picks up hoping shell bring in the crowds that Benzini needs to survive steals every scene shes in with her winsome personality and trickster ways (not to mention her ability to speak Polish).One note about that PG-13 rating The sexual content is mild dimly lit and nothing I wouldnt let a toddler witness. The violence however toward both people and animals is visceral and disturbing. During one particularly brutal beating I had to keep reminding myself ""Its only a movie. Its only a movie. No elephants were harmed.""But boy oh boy does that nastiness make the revenge that comes later oh-so-sweet.Water for ElephantsB+ Starring Reese Witherspoon Robert Pattinson Christoph Waltz and Hal Holbrook.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews Water for Elephants in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers"" Of course theres also a babe. Shes Marlena (Reese Witherspoon in bombshell mode) a spangled beauty atop the horses she strides in the ring. Hard luck for Jacob that Marlena is married to August Rosenbluth (another ""Bingo"" for Christoph Waltz) a ringmaster with a sadistic streak when it comes to animals and people who wont heel to his command. August is brutal on Rosie the 9000-pound elephant who becomes the shows (and the films) star attraction and Marlena when her eyes lock too hungrily on Jacob. Even nonreaders of the book can figure out what happens next. Its all in the telling. Gruen provided grit and pungent detail. The movie settles for gloss. Pattinson and Witherspoon smolder under the golden gaze of Rodrigo Prietos camera. But the story cries out for harsh glare sexual torment the acrid smell of sawdust and sweat. Thats why the films most memorable presence is Rosie. Shes not faking it not for a minute.

"Water for Elephants Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ElephantsMovie review Water for ElephantsDespite the stars lack of romantic chemistry theres much to enjoy in this cinematic retelling of Sara Gruens big top bestseller starting with the spectacular circus setting.April 22 2011|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon star in ""Water for Elephants."" (David James / 20th Century...)""Water for Elephants"" gives off an air of self-satisfaction and you can see why. What film wouldnt be pleased with having a No. 1 bestseller as source material an unapologetically picturesque world for its setting and major players such as Reese Witherspoon Robert Pattinson and a superb Christoph Waltz as its stars. Whats not to like? There is quite a bit to enjoy in a film that certainly qualifies as broad-based popular entertainment. But because the ingredients are so promising there hangs over this serviceable project the wish that it had turned out better still. Director Francis Lawrence who works in music videos as well as features has an unmistakable gift for bravura spectacle but the absence of convincing romantic chemistry means that the emotional connection that should be this films birthright is not really there. That spectacle comes courtesy of the 1931 Benzini Bros. circus setting of Sara Gruens epic romance about a man a woman and a 9000-pound elephant. The Benzini troupe bills itself grandly but the reality as one of Gruens characters says is that ""its probably not even the fiftieth most spectacular show on earth."" No matter. In the hands of veteran production designer Jack Fisk and his team costume designer Jacqueline West and master cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto that tarnished bawdy milieu including the raising of a massive circus tent that could seat 800 is brought to impressive and detailed life. The romance of the carnival is strong in this film and its not too much to say that its the element viewers will come away remembering most. If things had gone as planned young Jacob Jankowski (Pattinson) would never even have heard of Benzini Bros. But his hopes of becoming a veterinarian with a Cornell degree are dashed and the Depression-era freight train he hops in despair turns out to house the circus in all its ragtag glory. While Gruens book alternates chapters of young Jacob at the circus with a 93-year-old Jacob languishing in a contemporary nursing home Richard LaGraveneses screenplay cuts the elderly Jacob down to a bare minimum framing device. Which given Hal Holbrooks overeagerness with the role is probably a good idea. LaGraveneses smart script unable by the nature of the medium to duplicate some of the books narrative sleights of hand in general tightens the novels action and puts a bit of a bright PG-13 sheen on some of the raunchier aspects of the original narrative. Jacob still gets his introduction to circus life from the veteran Camel (Jim Norton) a kindly gentleman who shows him the ins and outs of this self-contained universe with its own language its own rules and its surprisingly rigid social hierarchy. Jacob starts out shoveling manure but his gift for animals is soon recognized and that becomes his area of expertise. No one is particularly eager to make Jacob feel at home but he cant help but be drawn to the beautiful platinum blond Marlena (Witherspoon) whose liberty horse act is the Benzini shows star attraction. Shes grateful to have the benefit of Jacobs veterinary knowledge but she is also very much married to August (Waltz) the shows magnetic owner and animal trainer. The gifted Witherspoon was attracted to this role early in the process. This despite the considerable time she has to spend in a performers leotard which goes against what shes called ""a conscious effort all of my career to not end up in a bathing suit in a movie."" What the actress likely saw was the opportunity to bring an uncharacteristic but essential hardness to the role of a survivor who would have been toughened by years spent being married to the dangerous mercurial August. If the circus is a hierarchical pyramid August is at the very top. Its a part tailor-made for the accomplished Waltz an Oscar winner for ""Inglourious Basterds"" and he eats it alive. Ruthless autocratic alternating between unapologetic sadism and unexpected concern August is easily the films most complicated and interesting personality. With his vigorous confidence and menacing voice this character holds the circus together the way the actor unifies and energizes the film. The turning point in ""Water for Elephants"" is Augusts acquisition of Rosie an enormous beast with a reputation for being ""dumb as a bag of hammers."" When Rosie brings out Augusts savage side (the films press materials emphasize that in reality Tai the elephant performer in question was never touched) it proves an opportunity for Marlena and Jacob to spend quality time together. Though fans of the ""Twilight"" series are not going to be pleased to hear this the weak link in this melodramatic chain is Pattinsons performance as Jacob. Though his removed affect made him ideal as one of the undead that quality makes him seem sullen petulant even pouty here. In a season thats seen strong chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt in ""The Adjustment Bureau"" as well as Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Monaghan in ""Source Code"" the absence of that quality here is especially noticeable. ""Water for Elephants"" offers a lot to look at just not enough to feel. kenneth.turanlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESNew on DVDOctober 30 2011Foxs success with lighter fare paves the way for darker...April 21 2011Robert Pattinson Water for Elephants the perfect...April 21 2011Reese Witherspoon gets a little disorderedApril 17 20112011 Movie Preview Water for ElephantsJanuary 16 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTElephantsEntertainmentRobert PattinsonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-water-for-elephants-20110422,0,6226053.story",200,waterforelephants22,waterforelephants,latimes

Can Robert Pattinson the 24-year-old Englishman who achieved a teen-talisman celebrity playing the dreamboat vampire Edward find longevity in a post-Twilight Saga acting career? For a few moments in Water for Elephants the answer seems yes. As Jacob Jankowski a part that requires him mainly to be shy and watchful RPattz radiates a slow magnetism that locks the viewers eyes on him. His easy smile -- not the smirk he often plasters on Edward or the louche sneer familiar from TV interviews -- invites us inside his star quality. And even without fangs hes got great teeth. Riffling Hollywood history for other icons who can suggest preternatural handsomeness in galoot roles we might think dreamily of Gary Cooper Montgomery Clift...until the vapors pass we return to 2011 and realize that however strong Pattinsons anachronistic attractiveness they dont make movies like Coopers Ball of Fire or Clifts A Place in the Sun any more. But they try -- as in this pachydermally ponderous film version of Sara Gruens popular novel. A circus memoir of the 1930s related decades later by the elderly Jacob (Hal Holbrook) Elephants is itself a flashback to Hollywoods midcentury when sentimental best-sellers routinely became films of high purpose whose every noble or venal emotion is cued by ostentatious program music. (James Newton Howard wrote Elephants sumptuous score.) The movie mood then was serious and swoony essentially feminine; now its ironic -- by which we almost always mean sarcastic -- and very dude. Id be pleased to see a vibrantly romantic picture defy the Zeitgeist and restore one of Hollywoods central genres. This just isnt the movie to do it. In 1931 early in the Great Depression young Jacob the son of loving Polish immigrants is a student at Cornell Veterinary College (Keith Olbermann went there). When his parents die in a car crash Jacob quits school and hitches a ride on a train carrying the Banzini Bros. Circus billed as ""the most spectacular show on Earth."" Because of his training with animals Jacob is hired by August (Christoph Waltz) the circus boss and ringmaster whos married to his star performer Marlena (Reese Witherspoon). From a bankrupt rival August buys a bull elephant named Rosie for whom Jacob proves to be the perfect trainer he speaks Polish she understands it. Jacobs gentle hand with Rosie and Marlena rouses the envious brute in August. The Banzini tent may collapse on all of them. Today a once-thriving industry is represented only by Cirque de Soleil and the limping vestige of Ringling Bros. Barnum amp; Bailey. But back when dozens of traveling shows crawled across America circus movies used to be big. Charlie Chaplins The Circus and Tod Brownings Freaks hailed from the period of Water for Elephants main story. The 50s saw a revival of circus films with Cecil B. De Milles The Greatest Show on Earth Ingmar Bergmans The Naked Night (also known as Sawdust and Tinsel) and Federico Fellinis La Strada. All these and Disneys Dumbo too mined the melodrama inherent in a milieu of temperamental artists natures oddities wild animals and men who use whips to impose discipline. To these stock elements Water for Elephants adds little. The script is by Richard LaGravenese whose earlier adaptations of beloved books -- The Bridges of Madison County The Horse Whisperer Freedom Writers P.S. I Love You and for that matter Beloved -- proved that some stories lose their intimate subtlety when transferred from page to screen. Any grand poignant or even plausible elements in Gruens novel get reduced to a standard tale of domestic and institutional sadism. (Why does August so viciously abuse the elephant hes just bought to be his star attraction? Because prod-prod thats how he treats females.) The role seems to exist only to let Waltz an Oscar winner as the Nazi sleuth in Inglourious Basterds play another purring psycho. After a career in videos the Vienna-born Francis Lawrence made a goofy-good movie Constantine and the more stolid but fitfully vivid I Am Legend. Here he concentrates on period nuance -- fine for an art director not so good for a director -- while letting the characters and actors evaporate. A love story has a major flaw if it doesnt convey that the two main characters are really in love. Jacob and Marlena are certainly simpatico in their respect for animals and their restlessness under Augusts boot but theyre both so well-behaved and repressed that their ardor lacks sparks or even smoldering glances. Though her character echoes Dietrichs name and is outfitted in Jean Harlows blond mane and white gowns Witherspoon offers no hint of the sultry or sensual; shes the nice soccer mom somebody stuck on top of an elephant. I watched her and thought of Amy Poehler. The proceedings get so slow and saccharine that viewers will relishes the films moments of redeeming idiocy. In one of them Marlena whispers to Jacob ""Bring Rosie to my tent and dont tell anyone"" -- as if the roustabouts wouldnt notice a 12-ft.-tall 10000-lb. creature striding down the midway. Granted theyd also take a look at his handler the divoon Robert Pattinson; but Rosie has a pretty strong odor too and thats what will stick to you after seeing Water for Elephants.

"Water for Elephants (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Water for Elephants (PG-13) Robert Pattinson successfully sheds his sparkling vampire skin in this adaptation of Sara Gruens novel. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald4/21/2011 Editor rating 3 In this long-awaited adaptation of Sara Gruens bestselling novel Twilights Robert Pattinson gets a chance to shed his sparkly vampire persona and play a romantic lead with a pulse. The change suits him. As Jacob Jankowski the orphaned veterinary student who joins a circus during the hard days of the Depression Pattinson gets the opportunity to do more than brood and look pasty and he makes the most of it. He grapples with real adult emotions gets in a few fistfights woos a beautiful woman instead of a sulky teen contemplates murder and yes frequently flashes a movie-star grin. Most impressive he prevents any of his formidable co-stars -- two Oscar winners and a several-ton pachyderm -- from walking away with the film. The novel is split into two narratives one set in the present by an elderly Jacob the other by his younger self. Director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend) wisely dispenses with most of the former. Played by Hal Holbrook the older Jacob -- light years more spry than the fragile 90something languishing in a nursing home in the book -- appears only at the films beginning and end as a narrative device. The decision to cut the material is a sound one and doesnt drain the films finale of much of its sentiment. Jacob admits that he has lived a ""big life"" and choosing to focus on the most interesting part of it puts Water for Elephants off to a good start. Jacob jumps into his fate almost by accident; his parents died the day of his final exam at Cornell but as they left him nothing he has a notion to head to the city and seek employment. Instead he impulsively hops aboard the Benzini Brothers circus train where hes apprehended immediately threatened -- and then put to work shoveling manure. His first day with the circus amazes him. He marvels at the speed at which the big top is raised (given the financially teetering Benzini Brothers its more grimy than majestic but Jacobs eye is inexperienced). He spies a lovely blond working with horses. Hes almost dumped off the train by the circus owner and ringmaster a disdainful fellow called August (the terrific Christoph Waltz forever doomed to play bad guys in American movies since his Inglourious Basterds Oscar win). Then Jacob lets slip that he studied to be a vet; suddenly August is all smiles and Jacob has a new job. Naturally the blond (Reese Witherspoon Walk the Line) is Marlena Augusts wife and while August seems a fair enough guy at first his cruel jealous streak soon surfaces especially after the circus acquires Rosie the elephant. August needs her to be a box-office draw and is not afraid to beat her viciously until she obeys him. His raging instability with Rosie acts as a pointed example of what might happen to a young man foolish enough to fall in love with Marlena. Water for Elephants deftly captures the romantic idea of running away to join the circus and the uglier details of what that life entailed in 1931 (the big cats eat spoiled entrails because the circus cant afford goats; the boss has thugs toss you out of your bunk if he doesnt want to pay you). Gruens novel is more ruthless in its depiction of the callous treatment of animals but more brutality might have been too much to stomach in a film thats essentially a romance; this Water for Elephants has been slightly prettied up for mass appeal. No matter. With the Benzini Brothers Circus everything is part of the illusion. Through our modern eyes the operation looks ragtag dingy distasteful. Through the eyes of Prohibition-era dirt-poor families though its magical a brief flight from reality. So enjoy the illusion; Water for Elephants is an engaging cinematic escape. Cast Robert Pattinson Reese Witherspoon Christoph Waltz Hal Holbrook. Director Francis Lawrence. Screenwriter Richard Lagravenese. Based on the novel by Sara Gruen. Producers Gil Netter Erwin Stoff Andrew R. Tennenbaum. A 20th Century Fox release. Running time 122 minutes. Language some violence sensuality. Opens Friday April 22 at area theaters.

She plays an equestrian he a circus veterinarian who pines to rescue her from her abusive husband the circus owner.""Water for Elephants"" is a circus movie offering all these - and more.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted April 22 2011In 1931 Jacob Jankowski isthisclose to getting his veterinary degree at Cornell when like lightning grief strikes. To escape his woes he runs away . . . to join the circus.More precisely he hops a freight carrying roustabouts from The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. No sooner does Jacob take a job shoveling muck out of the lion cages than this lad with animal skills and animal magnetism is named circus veterinarian.Jacob (Robert Pattinson) is quite taken with Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) the platinum-blond equestrian. But she is already taken - by tyrannical circus owner August Rosenbluth (Christoph Waltz) a composite of two characters in this smoky and atmospheric film adaptation of Sara Gruens novel Water for Elephants adapted into a swoony sawdust-and-spangles affair by filmmaker Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend).Steamy and sexy with a smack of sadism the movie is a throwback to old-school Hollywood action/romance. What with its big lush close-ups of the principals Rodrigo Prietos moody humidor-brown cinematography and the life-is-a-circus emotionalism Water provides the basic movie-movie pleasure of beautiful people struggling their way out of ugly situations.Theres not a lot of vitality in Lawrences direction but there is in the sepia clutter of Jack Fisks art direction and in the tension of the actors performances particularly those of Pattinson and Waltz.Witherspoon is lovely and looks like a wholesome Jean Harlow in the period costumes but the screenplay by Richard LaGravenese doesnt demand that she do much more than be decorative and anxious and gymnastic. Shes a nimble trick rider and acrobat. Its not her fault that the 5-foot-1 blond is upstaged by Tai the 8-foot-8 pachyderm with a stellar personality and a constellation of freckles who plays Rosie.In his first major role outside the Twilight franchise Pattinson is both effective and affecting as the youth who pines to rescue the woman in jeopardy from her abusive spouse. His Jacob is a quick study who learns when to tell the truth and when to exaggerate it.Waltz (who won a supporting-actor Oscar for Inglourious Basterds) delivers the films standout performance as August the possibly schizophrenic figure who projects a chilling sense of menace and possesses an unexpected sense of humor.Lawrences film which careens from the seaminess of the sideshow to the glitter of the center ring similarly exhibits some tonal mood swings. But it coheres in its fine performances which include those of Hal Holbrook and Paul Schneider that bookend the film.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Megan Nicolai Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Water for Elephants"" is partly a sawdust love story partly a survival story. It opens with an old mans reminiscence as Jacob Jankowski (Hal Holbrook) tells a young circus hand about his own Depression-era adventures under the big top. He didnt join the show out of any romantic impulses about carnival life. The well-planned veterinary career he expected was torpedoed by a family tragedy. And the first train he could hop just happened to be carrying roustabouts a menagerie a gorgeous trick rider Marlena (Reese Witherspoon) and her possessive husband the circus owner and ringmaster August (Christoph Waltz). Thats where the romance enters in. And the survival drama too. Twenty-something Jacob (Robert Pattinson looking much nicer tanned and smiling than he does in the ""Twilight"" series) gets a crash course in circus etiquette. The workers hate the performers the train doesnt slow down when deadbeats get tossed off the coochie dancers like to tease virginal lads and the animals produce staggering quantities of manure. As to the age-old commandment Thou Shalt Not Romance the Boss Wife he is respectful. At least initially. A handsome expensive-looking adaptation of Sara Gruens 2006 bestseller ""Water for Elephants"" balances the colorful glitz of a three-ring spectacle with the atmospheric realism that a rich drama demands. The sideline characters are hokey stereotypes but the main trio is well developed. Witherspoon doing her best work since her Oscar-winning ""Walk the Line"" is a decent dutiful wife struggling with her feelings for Pattinsons kind hunky animal lover. Waltz gives his role surprising depth. Hes a commanding personality shading into cruelty but you dont want to poke his eyes out. He can be both ruthless and kind and when he acts out violently hes contrite. After savagely beating Rosie the elephant the new star attraction hes mortified for losing control and sends the wounded pachyderm bottles of his best whiskey in apology. But when Marlena and Jacob find themselves dancing precariously on a tightrope of suppressed desire they are edging into dangerous territory indeed. Their animal attraction mirrored in the shows half-tame animals eventually pours out with catastrophic results. This is a story with one happy ending and many unhappy ones. David James 20th Century Fox Robert Pattinson in ""Water for Elephants."" TM and (c) 2011 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation. EAll rights reserved. ENot for sale or duplication. Director Francis Lawrence who brought a richly detailed feel to the fantasy worlds of ""I Am Legend"" and ""Constantine"" is right at home in the equally artificial milieu of a 1930s circus. He works new ground here however. The scenes of spectacle spangly aerialists and lion tamers are few. The films focus is on the dramatic interplay among its top-line actors shot in adoring close-ups. Witherspoons costumer did a great job fitting her with sleek Jean Harlow gowns for romantic nights on the town; her hairdresser spun her locks into an alluring platinum haze. Pattinson seems to improve as the movie goes along over-indicating at first but gradually relaxing into his naive awkward character. And the endlessly entertaining Waltz moves beyond his silky-monster thing to create a character who deserves admiration and pity as well as scorn. Even if your circus taste runs more to Soleil than Ringling theres a lot here to like.

Share Tweet The screen adaptation of Sara Gruens bestselling historical novel Water For Elephants has this in its favor Its the perfect release for an Easter weekend when families nationwide will be looking for inoffensive moderately engaging entertainment to distract them for a few hours without unduly upsetting anyone. Theres nothing challenging about this polished Depression-era romance but while it comes wrapped in a hearty dose of sentimentality and uplift it rarely tugs at the heartstrings hard enough to become cloying. It isnt a film the whole family can love but its a film the whole family can stomach. Twilight mainstay Robert Pattinson stars as a would-be veterinarian who stumbles into a job at a small traveling circus after a family disaster derails his college career at the very moment his final exam begins. (His professors couldnt have waited a mere two hours to tell him the bad news thus allowing him to graduate? Not in a story this devoted to broad strokes and contrived barriers.) At the circus he falls for pretty star attraction Reese Witherspoon the wife of mercurial abusive ringmaster Christoph Waltz. The circus is on the brink of financial ruin and Pattinsons new livelihood is periodically in danger until Waltz acquires an elephant named Rosie from a defunct competing circus. Then Witherspoon and Pattinson bond over their affection for the animal as Waltz becomes progressively more suspicious and violent which puts Pattinsons life in danger as well. Gruens novel was constructed around a single narrative surprise but there are no such shocks in the film version helmed by former music-video director Francis Lawrence (who also directed Constantine and I Am Legend). Its a tastefully managed passionless melodrama full of brooding looks and reasonably sweet moments but typified by a scantly characterized central couple who bring no sense of engagement to their relationship. Witherspoon comes across as sad and wary at best while Pattinsons terrible summation of his hopes for their future--""Youre a beautiful woman you deserve a beautiful life""--veers beyond callow into laughable. Only Waltz (the deserving Best Supporting Actor winner for 2009s Inglourious Basterds) brings some verve to his performance and even he winds up limited by the plodding story which mechanically brings two pretty people together traumatizes them then holds them apart. Water For Elephants respects its source material to the point of lacking its own identity or any sense of commitment but at least its mild innocuous charms assure it wont spoil the holiday weekend by being divisive or difficult.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Robert Pattinson has the face of a film-noir dupe. Its a face that is searching and open and kind. Its a face that a certain type of woman might want to fool because in its intensely old-fashioned kindness the face says ""I love you. Fool me. This isnt what girls and their aunts and their mothers -- the so-called so obsessed ""Twi-hards -- see in that face. What they see as it glitters pales and smolders with 100 years of undead solitude is a projection that makes them whisper ""Bite me. That antique nature of Pattinsons face gets an antique setting in ""Water for Elephants a beautiful and boring movie set in a traveling circus during the Great Depression. Pattinson is liberated from the brooding computer-generated action and noise of the ""Twilight movies and put beside Reese Witherspoon the ""Inglourious Basterds Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz scores of extras and an elephant the size of a two-bedroom apartment. It remains unclear whether Pattinson is any kind of actor but it wouldnt be premature to declare that at the very least hes not the bad kind.Pattinson plays Jacob Jankowksi a Cornell veterinary student whos left homeless after his Polish immigrant parents are killed in an automobile accident. He hops aboard a moving train that belongs to the Benzini Brothers circus and assumes the job of animal doctor. Death provides a natural occasion for The Face to do its melancholy thing. Instead Pattinson uses the movie to give his smile some exercise. Jacob sees Marlena (Witherspoon) the pretty gaunt acrobat with a platinum bob who stars in the circuss horse show and rather than think as I did -- she should be eating that horse not riding it -- he simply falls in love.Its the movie-ish ease with which Jacob succumbs that allows you to notice how ripe for exploitation he is. The veteran screenwriter Richard LaGravenese adapted the movie from a popular unabashedly sentimental 2007 novel by Sara Gruen. Its not ""Double Indemnity. But every time Jacob is in a room with Marlena and her brutally possessive husband the circuss owner August (Waltz) or when she sways with Jacob to R-rated Bessie Smith you feel hes being conned.With all due respect to the casting process this feels like a trio that tested better in an executives office than on a movie set. Its that lack of chemistry that makes you think a scheme is brewing. Why else would one of them want anything to do with the other two? They wind up lavishing attention on the elephant. Her name is Rosie shes played by Tai (check her out on Twitter) and in creating then shattering the illusion that shes just a big dumb beast Tai gives the best performance in the movie. (Its a photo finish with Hal Holbrook who plays an older chattier Jacob.)The director Francis Lawrence also made ""I Am Legend and is an accomplished maker of music videos. (He put Britney Spears in a top hat and tails for her ""Circus clip.) But this movie sags when it wants to lilt.The camera costumes and art direction do everything right. Too much so. The movie strips away both the grand weirdness of the circus and the dire desolation of the Depression. Diane Arbus and Dorothea Lange are exchanged for Vanity Fair.The movie maintains a manufactured glossiness that seems more 1920s than 1930s. And in Jacobs striving infatuation for a wispy blond Venus its not a circus performer he sees when he looks at Marlena. Its F. Scotts Fitzgeralds Daisy. All along the ""fool me had been saying something else ""I thought this was Gatsby.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris.

Water for Elephants Bad Director Francis Lawrence. Cast Reese Witherspoon Robert Pattinson Christoph Waltz. Rating PG-13 for moments of intense violence and sexual content. Guide to this weeks new releases Can Pattinson ride Elephants past Twilight? Based on bestsellers Spotlight Reese Witherspoon The good news about ""Water for Elephants"" director Francis Lawrences film based on the popular Sara Gruen novel is that it has plenty. The bad news is that the chemistry exists mostly between a man and an elephant. Unfortunately theres not much between stars Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. Add romantic chemistry to the list of things that fall flat in the film alongside dialogue and acting. Happily Christoph Waltz is on hand as a borderline psychotic - imagine if his ""Inglourious Basterds"" character owned a circus before the war - but even his menace seems forced. Jacob (Pattinson) is studying veterinary science at Cornell University in 1931 when his parents are killed. Left with nothing he hops a train - which turns out to be a circus train. ""I dont know if I picked that train or the train picked me"" he says which gives you some idea of the level of dialogue were dealing with. He bluffs his way into a position as the circus vet and quickly learns that August (Waltz) the owner and ringmaster rules with an iron fist over a group of central-casting-type workers and performers. August also is protective of his wife Marlena (Witherspoon) the star of the show. Mired in the Depression Augusts circus struggles. He has a unique method of laying off workers - he has his henchmen throw them from the train - and hes not above pulling a fast one on rubes. ""The world runs on tricks"" August says. ""Everyone plays."" (See level of dialogue above.) August is wary of Jacob but cant pass up having an Ivy Leaguer on board. He invites Jacob to his dinners with Marlena which seems odd - he does it again and again. Were presumably supposed to be aware of the sparks between Jacob and Marlena but only because Pattinson and Witherspoon have top billing. Oh and sometimes they dance. Circumstances conspire to bring an elephant named Rosie into the circus and August finally has his meal ticket. But the elephant wont perform so August nothing if not a sadist mistreats it. Then one night Jacob discovers that Rosie - who likes booze by the way - responds only to commands in Polish which he just happens to speak. The circus fortunes pick up from there only there are the barely detectable yet unresolved romantic feelings between Jacob and Marlena to be dealt with. The romantic angle just isnt strong enough to make us care. Its more fun to watch August go off on a rant. Hes a manipulative little man a control freak with a temper. Never a good combination in real life but agreeable enough in the movies. Waltz has fun with it in an over-the-top kind of way. Pattinson and Witherspoon fare less well. Theyre not bad exactly - just boring. Its a nice-looking film impressively staged and Rosie the elephant really is quite a performer. She saves the circus for a time; alas she cant save the film.

"Circus train tale delivers - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Circus train tale deliversWater for Elephants - 3.5 starsApril 21 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticLike ""The Notebook"" but with an elephant the unexpectedly good film version of ""Water for Elephants"" elevates pure corn to a completely satisfying realm of romantic melodrama. This adaptation of the Sara Gruen best-seller set in a storybook edition of Depression-era 1931 stars Robert Pattinson of the ""Twilight"" franchise as Jacob the earnest son of Polish immigrants ""a veterinary student from the wrong side of the tracks"" as 20th Century Foxs publicity describes him. A tragic off-screen accident renders him an orphan not long into the picture. Broke and distraught the Cornell student hops a freight train one evening that turns out to carry a most unusual form of freight. Its a circus train and with his animal skills along with his animal magnetism our hero finds a place for himself in the cash-strapped Benzini Bros. company. Much of ""Water for Elephants"" unfolds in one train car or another or in the open fields nearby where the big top rises and falls and the striptease artistes do their thing not far from the aerialists before its on to the next town. The Benzini crews mercurial sadistic ringleader played by Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds"" is married to star attraction Marlena played by Reese Witherspoon whose horse act is soon replaced by an elephant act. Her co-star is the pachyderm who wins Jacobs heart while enduring the cruelties inflicted by Waltzs August (not easy to watch even if you know the American Humane Association was all over this one). The elephant also wraps up the plot which canvasses everything from a tastefully smoldering romance between Jacob and Marlena to a climactic stampede. Corny right? Were back in the arena of Cecil B. DeMilles ""The Greatest Show on Earth"" (1952) or -- in the late silent era -- the now-lost F.W. Murnau circus story ""4 Devils"" (1928). That one began with title cards reading ""Step inside folks You come to laugh. And to be thrilled -- but do you know at what a cost to those who entertain you?"" While ""Water for Elephants"" is softer and more sentimental the material requires utter commitment and belief in the power of the corn. The ringer here is screenwriter Richard LaGravenese who helped make a very good film out of the worlds worst romance novel (""The Bridges of Madison County""). With ""Water for Elephants"" he has compressed the events very shrewdly without turning them into a manic ""Perils of Marlena"" serial. The female protagonist remains somewhat passive as she was on the page which can be frustrating. Waltzs archetypal villain cannot help but steal focus when hes on-screen partly because of the abuse of which the character is capable partly because Waltz is just so damned interesting to watch. Thats more than can be said for Pattinson who is easy to take without having yet made a single surprising or provocative choice as an actor. Yet he too is at least in there working his two or three notes hard and often effectively. The director Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") relies mainly on his artistic collaborators notably production designer Jack Fisk and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto to create and sustain the atmosphere. The digital effects never overwhelm things. Moving both the camera and the bodies within the frame Lawrence is more efficient than inspired at this point in his career but he does show solid instincts in letting actors interact within the frame. With his fierce emotional zigzags Waltz keeps Pattinson and Witherspoon (who retains immense audience appeal) on their toes. Hal Holbrook appears in the bookend sequences where we see old Jacob remembering back to the events of 31. The scenes recall ""The Notebook"" ""Madison County"" and a hundred other bars of soap. Its a testament to the general effectiveness of ""Water for Elephants"" that you dont watch it and mentally check-mark these precedents. I went with it. I was happy to go with it. The movie works and its only unexpectedly good because 20th Century Fox waited until the last minute to screen it for review. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for moments of intense violence and sexual content) Cast Reese Witherspoon (Marlena); Robert Pattinson (Jacob); Christoph Waltz (August); Hal Holbrook (Old Jacob) Credits Directed by Francis Lawrence; written by Richard LaGravenese based on the novel by Sara Gruen; produced by Gil Netter Erwin Stoff and Andrew R.

TWITTER The Reese Witherspoon-Robert Pattinson film will please fans of Sara Gruenas best seller but it lacks the vital spark that would have made the drama truly compelling on the screen. A decorous respectable adaptation of Sara Gruens engaging best-seller Water for Elephants would have come more excitingly alive with stronger doses of Depression-era grit and sexual spunk. The 1931 circus setting and a love triangle involving three exceedingly attractive people provides a constant wash of scenic pleasure and the films fidelity to its source will receive nodding approval from the books many fans which should result in solid if unspectacular commercial results for this Fox release. But the vital spark that would have made the drama truly compelling on the screen is missing. Films about traveling circuses and the often daring and dodgy people who worked in them used to be relatively commonplace in American movies and it could be that the novelty of seeing such a troupe traveling from one town to another on a train with dozens of performers workers and lots of animals in tow might be enough to captivate a fair share of people today just as Gruens 2006 novel did. Furthermore the central dilemma--that of a beautiful woman caught between her debt to the circus impresario who plucked her from a dismal existence to make her a circus star as well as his wife and her mounting passion for a handsome young man who escapes a personal tragedy by joining the company--may be well-worn but can always work in the right hands and Reese Witherspoon Robert Pattinson and Christoph Waltz are all more than up to the task. So its mostly a question of approach. Had the same story been made at the time its set in the early 1930s one can easily imagine at least two distinct and equally effective potential takes on the tale One directed by Frank Borzage at Fox could have been a exalted love story between two young people fated to be together despite the obstacles while another directed by Michael Curtiz at Warner Bros. would have been a punchy down-and-dirty affair about lowlifes scraping by during the depths of the Depression. In fact had screenwriter Richard LaGravenese whos done a mostly fine job whittling down the novel to fit comfortably within two hours running time settled in to watch a dozen early-1930s Warner Bros. films before writing some hints of period slang brassy attitude and regional accents might have profitably made their way into the chatter to provide an idea of the different vernacular in in use then. Even a tiny change--the man informing Pattinsons character of his parents death at the outset states they were in a ""car"" accident rather than an ""automobile"" mishap as in the book--reveals a trace of fear about the receptivity of a modern audience to antiquated speech. And in those days indelible character actors would have brought to life a score of insolent wise-cracking phrase-making secondary parts with just a few lines apiece. Under Francis Lawrences sleekly studied direction everything has been smoothed out to the extent that even dire poverty does not seem entirely unappealing. Certainly the three leads never do. Looking 300 per cent better than he did in his last non-""Twilight"" outing ""Remember Me"" Pattinson is entirely convincing as Jacob a Cornell veterinary school student who escapes from the ruin provoked by his parents untimely death by almost inadvertently joining the circus. Due to his imagined expertise with animals Jacob is taken under wing by the owner and ringmaster of the Benzini Bros. Circus August (Waltz) a mercurial fellow whos brought the company a long way since he took over and rightly keeps a watchful eye on his beautiful blond wife Marlena (Witherspoon) who rides the circus top animal attraction a stunning white horse. Embraced and roughly treated by turn Jacob earns a place with the outfit due to his knowledge of animals (his father had been a vet) and his help in recruiting and training a new star a jumbo elephant named Rosie. Something of a highbrow himself August delights in the college boys company but cant help but notice the growing affection between his wife and the bereaved lad. Although there are skirmishes from time to time it takes nearly the entire film for matters to fully come to a head and the lack of complexity danger and underlying tension becomes all too noticeable from the mid-point onwards. Once the climax does arrive the spectacular scene is over and done with far too quickly giving it a borderline perfunctory feel. Waltz in his first big film since soaring to prominence in Inglourious Basterds again scores strongly as a powerful middle-aged man who doesnt eliminate the snake in his grass before its too late. As for Witherspoon shes as fetching as ever as the platinum blonde any guy would want to catch But when August insults Marlena as being of a ""common type"" its clear Witherspoon needed to inject a bit of Jean Harlow into her characterization to emphasize the lower depths from whence she came that can never be entirely erased. Despite the hard glances and suggestion of a working class accent Marlena is still a shade too much the lady and not enough of a dame. Hal Holbrook does a nice job framing the tale as an elderly Jacob telling the story to a modern circus worker although by rights he should be narrating the whole thing not Pattinson; again modern audience sensibilities likely came into play. Craft contributions are excellent notably Rodrigo Prietos lustrous cinematography Jack Fisks highly realized production design and Jacqueline Wests resourceful costumes.
