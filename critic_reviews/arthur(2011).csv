Russell Brands obviously there for his naughty-boy charm but the casting backfires because hes not equipped for the part. Dudley Moore always suggested a sweet soul beneath the drink-fuelled bravado yet with Brand the showy petulance masks - what? - a deeper layer of showy petulance? Since Brand doesnt make us care whether Arthur finds love (and his big emotional moments expose the comedians acting limitations) the movies essentially a goner no matter that it finds inventive new ways to show off his billionaire spending power including a floating magnetic bed his own Batmobile and dinner for two in rented-out Grand Central station.That said the female roles the weakest element in the original get a makeover with Jennifer Garner effective as the grasping nouvelle riche earmarked for Brands dynastic marriage and mumblecore sweetheart Greta Gerwig stealing the show as the illegal tour guide whos the kooky-yet-endearing object of the heros affections. Gerwig is more relaxed than anyone not least Helen Mirren who cant work out whether her nanny role is bitchy or serious probably because the writing has de-clawed the John Gielgud character and ripped the heart from the story. The passage of time has brought us a blander more responsible Arthur with far fewer laughs and be warned a painful update on the classic Burt Bacharach title tune over the end credits.

"Arthur | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; arthur ) Arthur (United States 2011) April 10 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Its amazing how a lifeless pointless remake can provoke pangs of nostalgia about a mediocre movie. Such is the case with Arthur. The kindest thoughts I have ever experienced about the 1981 original occurred while I was watching Russell Brand and Helen Mirren re-shape roles defined by Dudley Moore and John Gielgud. The elements that made the original Arthur tolerable are largely absent here. In its broad strokes the 2011 Arthur is surprisingly faithful to its predecessor but the differences like the devil are in the details. The biggest problem relates to the laugh quotient. Arthur is meant to be a comedy but for the most part it isnt funny. Dudley Moores version fell short of a laugh-riot but at least there was a stream of well-earned chuckles. Not here. The first problem which manifests itself more forcefully in this iteration is having a ""funny drunk"" as the main character. Alcoholics are like clowns. To some theyre hilarious. To others theyre creepy. Arthur with his self-destructive and mean-spirited tendencies is closer to the latter than the former. His antics are more apt to generate cringes than laughter. For the 2011 Arthur to work a full re-imagination of the character was in order not merely a re-casting with a less likable actor. Arthur Bach (Rusell Brand) is a playboys playboy. With a net value approaching one billion dollars he can afford to throw away money and spend his nights and days drinking sleeping with women and making an ass of himself. After one escapade (masquerading as Batman in a working Batmobile) his mother Vivienne (Geraldine James) has had enough. She issues an ultimatum he will marry a wealthy heiress Susan Johnson (Jennifer Garner) or be cut off from his fortune. Despite Arthurs qualms about marrying as a business arrangement he is too attached to his desultory lifestyle to lose the money so he agrees. Of course its at this point when Arthur falls in love. The object of his affection is a tour guide and would-be writer named Naomi (Greta Gerwig). At first Arthurs former nanny and current confidante Hobson (Helen Mirren) believes Naomi to be a gold digger. Once she gets to know the girl however she changes her mind and begins to do what she can to champion the match. But Arthur has too weak a character to stay away from the bottle or end the engagement to Susan and when Naomi learns the truth she is understandably stricken. When Dudley Moore played the role three decades ago he brought a feckless charm and naivetA(c) to his portrayal. The same cannot be said of Russell Brand whose interpretation is that of a one-note whining drunk. In fact Brands Arthur is not much different from the characters he played in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek except in neither case was Brand saddled with the responsibility of carrying the movie. He can be funny but less is more. Taken in small quantities Brand can be an asset. Arthur illustrates what happens in the case of an overdose. Call the poison control hotline. The decision to hire Helen Mirren reflects the reasoning why an outrageous sum of money was paid to bring John Gielgud on board in 1981 - to have a respected and serious actor playing the ultimate straight man. There are two issues with the choice of Mirren. First she lacks the starch with which Gielgud infused the role. She emotes too much and shows emotional reserves; the absence of these qualities won her predecessor the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Secondly the ""stunt casting"" aspect of the ultra-classy Mirren slumming has already been done - after Red it has lost some of its zing. The real problem with Arthur is that its too like the original for comparisons to be avoided. Had the filmmakers breathed new life into the entirety of it as they do with the opening Batman-themed scene it could have stood on its own merits. The decision to play an instrumental version of ""Best That You Can Do"" during a romantic interlude forcefully recalls the 1981 production to the 2011 editions detriment. The remake of Arthur needs something to mark it as more than a retread but theres nothing. A few amusing one-liners aside the comedy is forced and mostly unfunny. Brand tries too hard. Mirren lacks the expected edge. Theres no chemistry between Brand and mumblecore queen Greta Gerwig (who it must be admitted is an improvement over Liza Minnelli). And the script tracks the source material too closely to offer anything fresh to viewers familiar with the Dudley Moore interpretation. The decision to helm an extraneous remake is a curious choice for TV director Jason Winer. This isnt the kind of project to get him noticed although maybe it pays the bills. For Russell Brand its an indictment of his ability to carry a movie. In the Coen Brothers recent True Grit Jeff Bridges allowed us to forget about John Wayne at least for a couple of hours. Here sadly the more we watch Brand illustrate how he is not the perfect choice to play Arthur the more we think about Dudley Moore. Thats not what anyone wants least of all the paying customers who would be well advised to use Netflixs streaming video feature and watch the original.

Thirty years after ""Arthur"" became one of 1981s biggest hits the economy has taken a nosedive alcoholism has long lost its comic novelty and Charlie Sheen has cornered the market on hooker-happy hedonism -- all of which seems to have been nervously taken into account in this innocuous blandly therapeutic remake of a comedy that wasnt exactly edgy to begin with. Cast names and lack of mainstream-laffer competition should ensure a healthy commercial profile but even the Brit-wit chemistry of Russell Brand and Helen Mirren cant offset the self-conscious degree to which this tame calculated effort sticks to its source. The fact that many in the films target audience may not have seen Steve Gordons still-charming Dudley Moore starrer will likely compel them to check out rather than avoid what ""Modern Family"" director Jason Winer and ""Borat"" scribe Peter Baynham have wrought here. The fewer reference points one has going in the better; while ""Arthur"" avoids overtly winking at its predecessor (apart from a new cover of Christopher Cross catchy title theme over the end credits) every beat here is clearly intended to update or embellish an equivalent aspect of the 1981 pic which would have been fine if the adjustments felt less cautious and more genuinely amusing. Our introduction to reckless rich boy Arthur Bach (Brand) is less an uproarious setpiece than a Warner Bros. tie-in as Arthur and his chauffeur Bitterman (Luis Guzman ill used) don Batman and Robin costumes and go tearing through the streets of Gotham in a Batmobile. After a long night of drunken carousing with nubile coeds in steps Hobson (Mirren) Arthurs dry dignified nanny who cleans up after his shenanigans ensures that he eats a non-liquid breakfast and encourages him to make a positive contribution to society for a change. Indeed Arthurs latest headline-making stunt is the last straw for his mother Vivienne (Geraldine James). Tired of his outrageously profligate lifestyle what he calls his ""savantish gift for defying death with fun"" she threatens to withhold his 950 million inheritance unless he shapes up and weds Susan Johnson (Jennifer Garner) New Yorks most eligible and emasculating high-society bachelorette. Right on cue Arthur meets the sweet working-class girl of his dreams Naomi (Greta Gerwig) a city tour guide whom he attempts to sweep off her feet in the most extravagant manner. A charming scene in which Arthur arranges a private date with Naomi in a magically emptied-out Grand Central Station suggests Winer and Baynham were trying to fashion a genteel romantic comedy rather than a neo-screwball exercise and to its credit the generally literate script doesnt recycle Gordons tart zingers. But however well intentioned the result simply lacks spontaneity and surprise as it progresses from mild laughs and sniffles to madcap wedding-day climax. Story also seems to have been run through a public-service filter with Arthur now forced to attend AA meetings and endure lectures about the irresponsibility of rampant spending during a recession further draining the joy from the proceedings. Feminizing the role that won John Gielgud a supporting actor Oscar Mirren is typically impeccable as the unswervingly loyal servant who for all her prim clucks of exasperation clearly adores her young charge. But the depth and resilience of Arthur and Hobsons bond a poignant surprise in the first film is here telegraphed too insistently from the outset. Making Hobson a nanny immediately softens the duos dynamic and Mirren hasnt been given the sort of withering dialogue that would compensate. If the good guys have been made more cuddly the opposite applies to the designated villains with Garner forced to play shrieking dominatrix hysterics and Nick Nolte granted a few unpleasant unfunny scenes as her terror of a father. At the other end of the spectrum Gerwig is as refreshingly guileless and winsome a presence as ever though after this film and ""Greenberg"" one hopes the onetime mumblecore goddess doesnt become the go-to girl every time some overgrown man-child needs a warm earthy love interest. But any ""Arthur"" rises and falls on its title character and while Brand (currently making hay with ""Hop"") was clearly cast for his rambunctious energy and quick wit his outsized persona all but upstages the character. This Arthur isnt an inebriated layabout who needs help; hes just a slightly neutered manifestation of the actors unruly id and he doesnt even seem to be all that drunk half the time. When it comes to Brands roles one expects sober or sozzled makes little difference. Smoothly crafted pic makes deft use of New York locations and production designer Sarah Knowles has a field day with Arthurs deluxe bachelor pad particularly the suspended magnetic bed that figures into one of the films few attempts at farce. Mellow feel-good soundtrack is in line with the generally lukewarm approach. ArthurProductionA Warner Bros. release of a Kevin McCormick/MBST Entertainment/Benderspink production.

By Peter Rainer Film critic April 8 2011 Save for later Saved Russell Brand (c.) slurs and sashays his way though Arthur. Greta Gerwig plays love interest Naomi in the remake of the 1981 romantic comedy. Sony Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Is there a less opportune time to remake ""Arthur"" the 1981 Dudley Moore comedy about a billionaire alcoholic who parties his way through life? In case anybody connected with this film hadnt noticed were up to our nostrils in a recession. Also drunk jokes arent exactly the laff riots they used to be in the old Dean Martin days (if they ever were). For timing this off youd have to go back to ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" another tone-deaf - or zeitgeist-blind - comedy.Russell Brand has been recruited for this ""reinvention"" and his presence in the film confirms my belief that a little of him goes a long long way.As Arthur Bach sole heir to his familys megabillion foundation Brand spends most of the movie slurring his words and sashaying off kilter. Were supposed to find this spoiled man-child adorable even though hes never without his flask drives drunk and stocks his suite at New Yorks Pierre Hotel with a passing parade of leggy gold diggers. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? To keep him in line and uphold the foundations image a marriage is arranged between Arthur and Susan Johnson (Jennifer Garner) a business executive whose corporate ambitions and no-nonsense personality are supposed to guarantee the foundations and Arthurs future. If he refuses to wed her he loses his billions. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? It seems a bit cruel to cast Garner who exudes charm in such a charmless role. Her opposite number is the fresh-faced woman-child Naomi (Greta Gerwig) an unlicensed tour guide who takes care of her ailing father and wants to write childrens books. Spoiler alert Arthur falls in love with her.The role of Arthurs butler played to a fine finish by John Gielgud in the original movie has been recast as a nanny. This at least gives Helen Mirren a chance to tone up the proceedings with her spot-on line readings and flinty hauteur. Nick Nolte as Susans burly father offers up his amusingly growly presence if all too briefly.But back to the zeitgeist thing. Its not necessary I suppose for a movie about a billionaire to be in lock-step with the times but couldnt the director Jason Winer and his screenwriter Peter Baynham at least have made more than passing reference to our current muck? When Arthur is reminded early on that the country is in a deep recession he responds with amazement then unloads an ATM for a cash giveaway to passersby. As far as topical references go thats about it.I dont buy the notion that this is all a lavish fantasy to cheer us in troubled times. Its too clueless and condescending for that. ""Let them eat cake"" has been modernized to ""Let them eat ATM machines.""

Pictures/MCTNick Nolte as Burt Johnson Russell Brand as Arthur and Jennifer Garner as Susan in Warner Bros. Pictures romantic comedy ""Arthur."" In comedy small is better. A lot of this is a question of scale; big movies tend to try too hard. Which is why ""Animal House"" is funnier than ""1941"" why ""Bruce Almighty"" was a hit and ""Evan Almighty"" the Eleventh Plague. But does the same rule apply to comedians? Thirty years ago Dudley Moore starred in the first ""Arthur"" as the short-statured top-hatted hero a fabulously wealthy (and guiltlessly drunken) Manhattan playboy. It was a deliberate throwback to 30s screwball comedies about the silly rich and unless you were a communist or a temperance advocate it probably seemed mildly cute. Now the movies been remade (and made longer) with the stilt-legged Russell Brand in the lead. And with this more-than-full-sized comedian in the role it seems somewhat -- distasteful. And thats about the size of it. Movie Review Arthur ((PG-13) Warner Bros. (110 min.) Directed by Jason Winer. With Russell Brand Jennifer Garner Helen Mirren Greta Gerwig. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains sexual situations strong language and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS The movie tries to compensate by infantilizing everybody. Now Arthur is accompanied not by a butler but a nanny -- and Brand seems to have deliberately pitched his voice a little higher to emphasize the immaturity of the man. His true love meanwhile -- played by Liza Minnelli in the original Greta Gerwig here -- has gone from ""kooky"" to kiddie arrayed in ridiculous little-girl outfits. Its an idea at least and probably has something to do with TV director Jason Winer here making his feature debut. But ""childish"" is not a proper substitute for ""childlike."" Its also at odds with the script which as adapted by Peter Baynham -- who worked on ""Bruno"" and ""Borat"" as well as the sublime TV series ""Im Alan Partridge"" -- still has a nasty British edge to it. I mean what Hollywood screenwriter would have a character joke about the crucifixion? Or call President Obama ""that coffee-colored gentleman""? Or dare to mock his own stars looks (the lush-lipped Jennifer Garner is described as looking like ""a sexy clown"")? Its a sardonic screenplay filled with juvenile characters and the whole thing doesnt mesh. Thank heavens at least for Garner who seems to be having a good time as a heartless social-climber. And Helen Mirren who takes John Gielguds original role as the servant (the best part in the story) and gives it her own quite imperious spin. The Manhattan backgrounds look lovely as do some of Arthurs toys (he has a fondness for movie props). Mirren and Garner do the heavy lifting the deadpan Luis Guzman puts in an appearance and well at least we dont have to listen to any Christopher Cross songs this time around. But apart from that well if ""Arthur"" is what you like go back and rent ""Arthur."" The first one was funnier and shorter -- and not just in running time -- and oddly that seemed to help.

Russell Brand and Helen Mirren star in the 1.5-star-rated remake of ""Arthur.""(Barry Wetcher) Movie review Arthur All of the hangover with none on the fun Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 08 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English When Arthur first made an appearance as a frothy little rom-com - 30 years ago to be precise - Dudley Moore lushed it up in the title role of the perpetually inebriated playboy leaving John Gielgud to steal the picture not to mention an Oscar as the drunks devoted and long-suffering and oh-so-caustically witty butler. Apparently somebody thought it was time for a remake. Clearly somebody was dead wrong. Movies Arthur The official trailer Not content with merely ripping off the original this version strives for innovation by engaging in a bit of gender-bending. The slim plot is basically the same albeit cleaned up for the more conservative tastes of todays family audience. Once more Arthur must choose between the sprightly gal of his dreams and the corporate barracuda foisted on him by his chairman of the board mother. Pick real love and Arty will lose his fat inheritance. The aforementioned bend has Hobson the butler morphing into Hobson the nanny a change that proves wonderfully instructive. In fact along the way were offered many valuable lessons in how to ruin what used to be a perfectly innocuous and often hilarious comedy. Here are just a few of them. No. 1 Cast Russell Brand as Arthur. Admittedly at first blush this seems like a splendid idea. After all Brand is an amusing fellow and demonstrated in Forgetting Sarah Marshall that he too can steal a picture in a subordinate role. Maybe thats why as the star here he seems determined not to have any such theft happen on his watch. So the guy hogs the screen and the dialogue improvising his way through a script that clearly needs his help. Trouble is his improvs are always scattershot and often desperate - a few hit most miss. No. 2 In keeping with our more infantilized culture make Arthur less a drunk than a child. Inflate his fortune - its up to 950-million - and then inflate his toys showing what money can buy the modern man-child. Seems it can buy the actual Batmobile a magnetized bed that floats in midair the power to evacuate Grand Central station for a dinner party with Pez candy as the main course and a side helping of flying acrobats. Wow. Now if only money could buy a screenwriter to make any of this remotely funny. No. 3 Cast Helen Mirren as the nanny. Again a great choice on the surface yet not when this distaff Hobson is robbed of any sarcastic edge and smoothed into Arthurs moral conscience. Of course a conscience is many fine things but caustically witty it aint. Poor Helen. Feasting on wicked lines Gielgud won the Oscar. Force-fed this diet of goodness Mirren looks like she just lost her lunch. No. 4 Completely waste Greta Gerwig as the romantic interest. As was abundantly evident in Greenberg the camera loves her near-wholesome almost-beautiful looks - shes like the girl next door to the girl next door. But here as if to prove likes attract Gerwig is reduced to the same childish status as Brand just another kid but without the booze. No. 5 Inflate the running time along with that fortune thereby affording ample opportunity to pad with lots of clunky set pieces and an aging star or two. Like Nick Nolte. Briefly he pops up as the barracudas father a burly contractor not just tough as nails but full of nails. Literally - the guys punctured with them. To what end? Far as I can make out to allow Brand to stare at the protruding spikes and improvise this ""It made a hero out of Jesus."" No. 6 Know that this tiny brush with heresy is the funniest line in the movie and have faith that even in the lame case of the resurrected Arthur Jesus saves.

In 2007 Gerwig was the precious lead in Joe Swanbergs microbudgeted comedy ""Hannah Takes the Stairs"" a film released when Swanberg and several other directors were lumped together into a shakily defined ""mumblecore"" movement. It was a surge of lo-fi cliquish productivity by a group of close-knit filmmakers and ""Hannah"" epitomized it since Gerwigs character becomes the object of desire for two men played by fellow mumblecore auteurs Mark Duplass and Andrew Bujalski. Mumblecore was on everyones mind with a suddenness that took even its contributing members by surprise. The year after ""Hannah"" premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival Gerwig appeared in ""Baghead"" directed by Mark Duplass with his brother Jay in addition to Mary Bronsteins discomfiting drama ""Yeast"" and Swanbergs brooding break-up saga ""Nights and Weekends"" where she shared a credit as co-director. All three movies showed up at SXSW in unison. As mumblecore -- which basically referred to plotless improvised narratives made cheaply by young white people who knew each other -- assumed a false currency in the media Gerwig was anointed as its queen. Now Gerwig has moved into the mainstream with ""Arthur"" a remake of the 1981 romantic comedy starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli. It features Gerwig opposite foppish Brit sensation Russell Brand was produced by Warner Bros. for many millions of dollars and hits theaters around the country this weekend. In the weeks leading up to its release Gerwig has been the subject of many defaced subway posters and trailers viewed by millions. Coupled with a bit part in the Ashton Kutcher-Natalie Portman vehicle ""No Strings Attached"" the release of ""Arthur"" marks the next big step in Gerwigs career following her central role last year in Noah Baumbachs ""Greenberg."" Although ""Greenberg"" paired her with Ben Stiller it was still a small movie mainly seen by arthouse audiences whereas ""Arthur"" caters to the masses. Has Gerwig sold out or have the studios bought in? Read on. In light of the deplorable track record for Hollywood remakes ""Arthur"" is actually a fairly serviceable return to the genially funny traits of the original and borrows some of its best moments. Once again the title character begins as a sophomoric drunk bored with the magnificent fortune into which he has been born. This time its his petulant mother -- rather than the snobbish father of the original -- who gives Arthur an ultimatum on his playboy lifestyle Marry power-hungry heiress Susan (Jennifer Garner) or lose the family fortune. Arthur reluctantly agrees until he randomly meets blue-collar Queens resident Naomi (Gerwig) and falls for her which leads him to reevaluate his priorities. Magnificently shot to take advantage of New York City iconography ""Arthur"" is easy on the eyes intermittently amusing and never downright awful. Its also beyond some fancy techniques nothing special. The likable Brand goes through a naturally predictable transition mans up and learns to give up the bottle for the woman he loves. Director Jason Winer lands a few solid gags based around Arthurs absurdly pricey lifestyle including a memorable bit involving metal underwear and a magnetic bed. Nevertheless like many remakes the movie primarily exists to grab the attention of viewers unaware of the original. Thats where Gerwig comes in. Filling Liza Minnellis shoes Gerwig plays the cool chick a hip wannabe writer living on a tight budget. The movie relies on her presence just as the original relied on Minnelli to provide a scrappy contrast to the rigid luxuries dominating Arthurs world. Gerwig is game She plays off Brands embodiment of a spoiled brat with quirky charm and even holds her own against Dame Helen Mirren as the protective housemaid who has been responsible for raising Arthur from infancy. While Gerwigs presence holds ""Arthur"" together the initial one-sheet for failed to include her leading many bloggers to the realistic conclusion that the studio deemed her too much of an unknown. In truth she provides its secret weapon specifically because her screen persona stems from such a different cinematic terrain. When Arthur first sees Naomi delivering an unlicensed tour of Grand Central he calls her ""a radiant stranger"" which sounds about right in this context. As Brand watches her speak of the buildings history the dialogue goes out of synch and she moves in slow motion. Its a cliched effect but appropriate for her first big scene in front of audiences previously unfamiliar with her face. Those accustomed to Gerwig from her other roles might be more used to seeing her sans heavy make-up and expensive Hollywood lighting two ingredients here (along with 35mm film) that essentially commercialize her typically naturalistic appearance. But Gerwigs credible self-deprecation and adorable uncertainty stay intact precisely because the character description demands for it. Thats the entire coup behind mumblecore hitting the mainstream By going against the grain Gerwig fits right in. Gerwigs appearance in ""Arthur"" smooths over some of the rougher aspects of her performance history particularly the nudity. The Qamp;A following the 2008 premiere of ""Nights and Weekends"" was among the more awkward in festival history given that audiences had just watched Swanberg and Gerwig writhe about a Manhattan hotel room in their birthday suits for the movies prolonged (ahem) climax. Nobody bares all in ""Arthur""; in fact during the most enchanting scene when Brands character clears out Grand Central so he can take her there for a private dinner date she announces ""Im not getting naked."" Indeed Not every staple of mumblecore can survive the transition to Hollywood. Mumblecore may persist as an idea but it burned out quickly. By late 2008 the perception of a systematic ""movement"" in independent film reached a breaking point. Save for the free publicity the participating filmmakers didnt care for the term. The word stuck around but its founders spread out. As if to underscore that point Ti Wests 2009 low-budget horror effort ""House of the Devil"" included a scene in which Gerwig in a supporting role got her head blown off by a psychopath -- a symbolic act marking the end of a new wave that never really gelled. However if mumblecores indie bubble burst Hollywood used Gerwig to reconstruct it. Imported to the faux indie charm school epitomized by Zooey Deschanel Gerwig is now readily marketable as even Arthur realizes when he creates a specially designed Pez dispenser that resembles her head. ""As soon as I saw you"" he says ""I knew I wanted to eat candy out of your neck."" Audiences at the screening I attended giggled along with her. Awkwardly positioned for years Gerwigs mumblecore brand is secure in a world that has plans for it. criticWIRE grade B- This Article is related to Reviews More From IndieWireTallulah Review Sian Heders Overwrought Debut Hits Hard at Flawed Mothers and ViewersRose McGowan Damage Inc.

"Arthur reviewed Russell Brand and Helen Mirren remake a campy classic. Slate Sign In Sign Up Arthur reviewed Russell Brand and Helen Mirren remake a campy classic. Arthur reviewed Russell Brand and Helen Mirren remake a campy classic. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 7 2011 1038 PM Arthur The best that you can do is skip this one. By Dana Stevens Russell Brand in Arthur I was in the middle of writing a review of Jason Winers remake of Arthur (Warner Bros.) that half-apologized for my vaguely remembered fondness for the 1981 original. Then I rewatched the original--and scrapped the old lead. The original Arthur isnt a perfectly constructed comedy; it lurches a bit in the romantic scenes and shifts tone too often--but when its funny its really funny. (The best jokes are rounded up nimbly in this YouTube montage.) As the perpetually sloshed playboy Arthur Bach and his sardonic butler Hobson Dudley Moore and John Gielgud have the micro-calibrated rapport of a vaudeville Bertie and Jeeves. In fact I straight-up love the original Arthur (including and especially ""Arthurs Theme"" by Christopher Cross which is wanly reprised in one scene of the new version.) Given Hollywoods current propensity to remasticate any and all valuable entertainment properties as methodically as a cow chewing its cud Arthurs number was bound to come up eventually. (Be warned that these 1981 hits are due for recycling Cannonball Run Body Heat My Dinner With Andre.) So Ill let go my sense of personal affront and grant the Arthur remake the right to exist. The question then becomes not whether this Arthur is worthy of the original but whether its worth two hours of your weekend. And the answer I fear is no. If you get caught between the moon and New York City--or even just between two movies at the multiplex--the best that you can do is skip this one. Advertisement The lanky British comic Russell Brand with his well-documented junkie past and hypersexualized party-boy persona was one of the high points of Forgetting Sarah Marshall in which he played the dimwitted and aggressively sober pop star Aldous Snow. Brands welcome started to wear in Get Him to the Greek where he played the same character in a precipitous 48-hour fall off the wagon. Still Brand seemed a reasonable enough fit for the part of Arthur. Though hes less of a lovable loser than the diminutive Moore Brand shares Moores quality of seeming debauched and innocent at the same time. Pairing Brand with Helen Mirren in the role of Hobson the butler (here transformed into a nanny) also sounded like a good idea. Martini-dry delivery has long been one of her specialties and really is there any such concept as ""too much Helen Mirren""? And yet this remake of Arthur fails starkly and completely either to capture the magic of the original or to create any of its own. The problem with this movie goes deeper than the casting or performances deeper than the script by Peter Baynham (who collaborated on the Borat and Bruno films as well as the BBC series Im Alan Partridge) or the direction by Winer (the co-executive producer  of the acclaimed ABC series Modern Family). Sure the jokes could be funnier and the execution crisper but at heart a 2011 Arthur just doesnt make sense. Alcohol and money mean completely different things in the movies now than they did 30 years ago--basically theyre both a lot less fun. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Arthurs dilemma--he must marry a stuck-up society girl chosen by his family (Jennifer Garner) or lose his vast fortune overnight--doesnt scan in a world where wealth and respectability have long since amicably split and a dissolute heir only stands to gain in status by misbehaving publicly. (A miscast and for the first time annoying Greta Gerwig plays the strangely infantilized pixie from Queens who turns Arthurs head on the eve of his wedding.) The recession--and in a wider context the massive upward transfer of wealth thats occurred in the 30 years since the Reagan era--have made the notion of an idle but lovable billionaire harder to take. And above all the spread of AA culture and the recognition of alcoholism as a disease have made drunk jokes--a comic staple in Dudley Moores day--seem gauche and unfunny. This Arthur acknowledges the recession exactly once and has its hero compensate for this staggering financial injustice by taking cash out of an ATM and throwing it at a dozen or so hangers-on. And when Arthur 2.0 goes to a church-basement AA meeting and owns up to his addiction issues--well more power to Brand for quelling his real-life demons but Id rather watch Moore painstakingly balance a glass of whisky on the fender of his vintage car. Correction April 8 2011 The article originally misidentified Jason Winer as the sole creator of Modern Family. (Return to the corrected sentence.)

Joe Neumaier Friday April 8 2011 400 AM Title Arthur With Russell Brand Greta Gerwig Helen Mirren. A wealthy playboy drinks himself silly until he meets the right woman. Director Jason Winer. (150) PG-13 Language sexuality. At area theaters.There are two signs that the new ""Arthur"" is a badly slurring shadow of the 1981 mini-classic starring Dudley Moore.The first is a small but notable difference on the movie poster. On the original the ""a"" in ""Arthur"" is leaning precariously against the ""r"" as if recovering from a tough night out. The new logo is straight-ahead boring typical. The second and more crucial alteration is that this ""Arthur"" is missing a soul.A genuine melancholy ran through the story the first time which made its title characters drunken-playboy antics more than just clownishness. That grounding sadness has been replaced by a chintzy sentimentalism as clunky as its comedy.Russell Brand is Arthur Bach a 30-ish billionaire cavorting through New York like its his personal playpen. His nanny Hobson (Helen Mirren) scolds him but boozing and partying are Arthurs reasons for being. Not even his detached mother forcing him to marry twitchy businesswoman Susan (Jennifer Garner) can sober Arthur up.Then he meets poor artistic Queens resident Naomi (Greta Gerwig in the Liza Minnelli role) and Arthur has a reason to change. But the wedding to Susan is fast approaching and Arthur faces a real life -- in other words hell be poor -- if he doesnt marry her.The late Steve Gordons original script had its heart in the unconventional rhythms of screwball comedy while director Jason Winers new take makes the tale nothing but conventional.Scenes of Arthur dressing up as Batman and joy-riding in a Batmobile feel like a studio in-joke while Garners psycho sex kitten and Gerwigs dopey bohemian are dull distillations of a million other rom-com specimens.This showcase for Brands lanky steamrolling personality comes up far short of 100-proof laughs. He plays Arthur as clingy and clownish and the British comic aims for one click above moronic. Garner Gerwig and Luis Guzman as a simpleton chauffeur follow suit. (Mirren in the haughty-caregiver role that won John Gielgud an Oscar simply looks bored.)When a scene of Arthur attempting to get a job falls embarrassingly flat the movies idea of a save is to dress him up as a giant gummy bear.That underscores the biggest reason the movie fails Aside from a handful of amusing riffs the movie is about a joke machine who (literally) runs down the street in his underwear not a flawed person running from himself. Its hard to tell when this Arthur is drunk and when hes not because he is always as phony and as funny as a two-dollar bill.

Starring Russell Brand Helen Mirren Jennifer Garner Nick Nolte Greta Gerwig Luis Guzman Geraldine James Leslie Hendrix Jennifer Butler Anya Bergstedt Jordanova Director Jason Winer Running time 150 Release Opened Apr 8 2011  Editorial Review Friends dont let friends act drunkBy Michael OSullivanFriday April 8 2011Was the lovable lush ever funny? I mean honestly? Maybe it was a hoot back in the 1970s the heyday of comedian Foster Brooks who made a career out of pretending to be shellacked on ""The Dean Martin Variety Show."" By 1981 when the original ""Arthur"" came out the slurred-speech shtick of Dudley Moore -- the titular playboy alcoholic who cackled wildly at his own jokes and then fell down -- was already getting old.In 2011 the sight of Russell Brand doing essentially the same thing in an utterly redundant remake directed by sitcom veteran Jason Winer (""Modern Family"") is a little bit pitiful. At least in the first movie John Gielguds Hobson the manservant of the perpetually inebriated heir Arthur Bach was given a steady arsenal of dry and acerbic laugh lines to keep the film -- and its audience -- from falling asleep.In the new gender-flipping version Hobson is played by Helen Mirren a brilliant actress for whom writer Peter Baynham hasnt managed to find a single humorous thing to say. This ""Arthur"" is an exercise in time-travel tedium a trip to the Land That Funny Forgot.For those who dont remember the original story -- or who were born after it came out -- the premise is straightforward. Arthur (Brand) is the man-child heir of a family fortune who has been burning up his trust fund with hookers and booze. After he embarrasses his shrewish strait-laced mother (Geraldine James) one time too many by crashing one of his collection of vintage movie cars (in this case the Batmobile one of the films few gags that works sort of) Mommy Dearest lays down an ultimatum Marry the gold-digging but pedigreed Susan (Jennifer Garner in claws-out mane-shaking glory) or be cut off from the money tree forever. Arthur agrees reluctantly. That is until he meets Naomi (Greta Gerwig) a sweet and penniless free spirit (who is also apparently unable to detect the stink of alcohol on Arthurs breath in the many close-up scenes in which their faces are an inch apart).Perhaps shes merely won over by his English charm though other than the accent there is no practical evidence of it on screen. Once again Brand has chosen a role for which his manic impish and verbally dextrous comedy skills are not just ill suited but smothered. Hes like a major-leaguer trying to limp around the bases in a Little League uniform.Its painful perplexing and kind of sad.Arthurs mother pretty much sums it up when she says to him early in the film ""How can you squander your considerable intelligence on idiocy like this?""How indeed? Contains sexual situations some obscenity comedic alcohol abuse and far more jokes and/or sight gags related to the main characters ""winkie"" than are strictly necessary or funny.

Photo Barry Wetcher Even Helen Mirren cant save this. (Barry Wetcher) Attempting to fill Dudley Moores top hat in ""Arthur"" Russell Brand rapidly descends the rungs of the comedy ladder from ""unfunny"" to ""irritating"" to ""vulgar"" to the bottom one -- ""Andy Dick."" Moore Oscar-nominated in the 1981 classic was Paddington Bear with a martini glass. Brand plays the alcoholic manboy zillionaire Arthur Bach with all of the exhausting vigor of those improv comics who turn every prop that crosses their field of vision into an excruciating ""bit."" (Hey a tea bag Lets riff) If you were at a dinner party with Brands Arthur your lips would hurt from pretending to smile while thinking (as in the worst Robin Williams movies) ""Does this guy have an off switch?"" Arthur is a lost little rich boy whose only friend is his nanny Hobson (an admirable but not especially funny Helen Mirren in the part that won John Gielgud his Oscar). He is under pressure to marry a high-strung corporate social climber (Jennifer Garner) or be disinherited. As the wedding preparations proceed hes smitten by a proletarian Queens girl (the delicate and luminous Greta Gerwig who seems about as working-class as Gwyneth Paltrow). Their meet-cute is a painfully contrived scene in which she is nearly arrested for um illegally conducting a walking tour of Grand Central Terminal. PHOTOS JENNIFER GARNERS LEADING MEN The one aspect of the remake thats more creative than the original is this The script puts a lot of energy into thinking about how to spend. In the original Arthur was bored by his loot. This film is feverish about it. Arthur shuts down Grand Central for an hour and orders a carpet of rose petals and twirling acrobats for his big first date with Naomi (Gerwig). Gerwig (so endearing in ""Greenberg"") is an actress who glows with genuineness. Shes an indie angel the last girl youd expect to fall for this tasteless ""Pretty Woman"" glitz-worship. When she shows him the whispering corners in Grand Central that charmed generations of canoodlers he says nothing romantic. He wants to buy them. Arthur is the CEO of Missing the Point Inc. and a tender childrens book author like Naomi would be the first not last to notice. The TV-trained director Jason Winer of ""Modern Family"" forgets that movies dont have to blare their points as there is less danger youll wander off to the fridge. So we get several instances of Arthur misting up; get me some black velvet to set off this sad clown. ""Check it out--this is poignant"" is the message of a death scene replacing the stark empty bed of the original. Instead of wit and heart we get aggressively stupid slapstick The shrill and dreary Garner in a metal bustier gets stuck to the bottom of a magnetic bed. Arthur dressed as Batman zooms his Batmobile underneath the Wall Street bull statue solely to set up a shot with Brand posed beneath giant bronze testicles. Any film studio but one would have found itself heartily sued by Warner Bros. for such misuse of the Batman iconography. But alas theres no law against Warners (which is releasing ""Arthur"") embarrassing itself. Mirren being Mirren maintains her icy poise but there is no excuse for putting her in a Darth Vader mask and having her say rude things. Nor should we be invited to contemplate the idea of Brand gnawing at her breasts (""I had to dab Tabasco on my nipples"" she says). Remaking ""Arthur"" wasnt automatically a bad idea and some of the dialogue in the almost completely rewritten script might be funny from someone mugging half as much as Brand. Unable to relax Brand is unable to charm. Without coming near a ukulele he manages to be as odious as his doppelganger the 60s novelty singer Tiny Tim. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Karina Smirnoff to pose nude in Playboys May issue Read Next Karina Smirnoff to pose nude in Playboys May issue Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 62475 How Hillary blew her big moment 30450 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 21595 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Well-remembered for Dudley Moore and John Gielguds droll performances its a good but not great trifle with a premise thats easily adapted for another performer a wealthy drunk playboy engaged to a fellow socialite whom he doesnt love meets the woman of his dreams. Russell Brand does the same sort of wild-living hedonist routine that Moore did (though he does it taller); the original isnt an untouchable classic; heck why not? Thats basically how the remake -- with Brand as Arthur and Helen Mirren in the Gielgud role of his valet/caretaker -- has turned out Heck why not? Complain all you want that Russell Brand is no Dudley Moore (and youll get no argument here) but the lanky skeletal comic can deliver a dry exceptionally British line of dialogue with the best of them. The dialogue hes given to work with by screenwriter Peter Baynham who has written for subversive British comics Steve Coogan and Sacha Baron Cohen isnt always stellar and the story is as dully conventional and trite as it was 30 years ago. But Brand and Mirren attack it with gusto handing in near-perfect performances like the old pros they are. Theres no more reason to rush out and see it than there was for anyone to make it but since the opportunity has presented itself -- heck why not? Brands character Arthur Bach is heir to a billion-dollar fortune who spends his days and nights drinking dressing up as Batman carousing through New York and generally living the high life. In all things he is supervised by Hobson (Mirren) his nanny since childhood and surrogate mother. His actual mother Vivienne (Geraldine James) disapproves of his nonsense and threatens to cut him off from the money if he wont marry Susan Johnson (Jennifer Garner) who comes from a wealthy family and can reassure investors that the Bach empire is in good hands. This is in Arthurs words ""a macabre conspiracy to inveigle me into a loveless marriage"" -- a good example of the eloquently humorous turns of phrase at which the film occasionally excels. The plan is disrupted when Arthur meets Naomi (indie darling Greta Gerwig) an underemployed Brooklyn girl who -- thats right -- is free-spirited and pixie-ish. (Im pleased the movie doesnt overdo this cliche since Arthur is pretty laid-back himself.) Hed rather be with Naomi but will lose all his money if he does. Its not like he can get a job though he does try this briefly with predictably disastrous results. The degree to which you find all of this entertaining will depend on how much you are generally fond of Brand no question about that. But I give him credit for at least attempting to create a real character here rather than just playing himself. Arthur is spoiled but hes big-hearted and you cant blame him for trying to solve every problem with money not when its the only thing hes ever been taught. Brand is amply supported -- perhaps even overshadowed -- by the ever-delightful Helen Mirren a seasoned veteran who cares not one whit that the part shes playing has been played before. She helps us see that for as frustrated as Hobson is with her exasperating charge she genuinely loves the big moron. And can anyone tell a drunk party animal ""Your safari into the pointless ends now"" with more grace and authority than Helen Mirren? As Naomi Gerwig interacts well with her more famous costars. What could easily have been the Arthur amp; Hobson show -- stand back and admire their hilarity -- is instead more inclusive; Naomi gets some good punchlines too. Sadly thats about as far as the sharing of wealth goes. The amusing Luis Guzman is wasted as Arthurs chauffeur a dumb guy in a movie with no place for dumb guys; Nick Nolte is given nothing sensible to do as Susans brash self-made-millionaire father; and Jennifer Garner has the thankless role of Arthurs cartoonishly bottom-line-minded fiancee. The scene in which Susan shows up drunk at Arthurs penthouse is nonsensical in the context of the story and more than a little embarrassing for Garner who doesnt play that type of loosy-goosy stuff well. This could be the kind of movie that gets remade every generation or so plugging whoever the current Russell Brand type is into the lead and updating the details. This generations Arthur certainly wont be as beloved as the last generations but its no disservice either. With a handful of solid laughs and a modicum of snappy dialogue its liable to amuse if not overwhelm an audience seeking casual forgettable entertainment. Grade B-     Eric D.

Warner Bros. Pictures By John Anderson Updated April 8 2011 1201 a.m. ET ""Mirthless"" is not the kind of adjective that makes its way onto full-page movie ads but its the most charitable way of describing the new ""Arthur"" a remake of the celebrated 1981 comedy about a wealthy wastrels eviction from dipsomaniacal paradise by his family and Liza Minnelli. Its always been a problematic premise Dudley Moores original Arthur Bach dissolute heir to an Old New York fortune was gleefully unburdened by aspirations or stress or work and he had enough money to remain that way. His only concern was how quickly he could slip into the next tumbler of scotch. He may not have been a role model. But he was certainly a guilty pleasure. Watch a clip from the modern day remake of the classic Dudley Moore comedy. Starring Russell Brand and Helen Mirren. Courtesy Warner Bros. Theres no reason to feel guilty about the updated ""Arthur"" directed by Jason (""Modern Family"") Winer except for the seemingly endless amount of time one spends with Russell Brand. The suddenly ubiquitous Mr. Brand was fast becoming Hollywoods go-to guy for debauched Brits (""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" ""Get Him to the Greek"") before someone decided to make him adorable--a horrifying idea made worse by his casting in a movie which at this point in our social evolution might just as well have been made on another planet. No one outside of the filmmakers apparently need to be told that ever since Mr. Moore made drunkenness hilarious there have been seismic shifts in attitude and opinion regarding substance abuse addiction 12-step programs general health etc. etc.--call it the New Puritanism call it good sense--to which the new ""Arthur"" seems fairly oblivious. The very idea of this movie suffers from a form of myopia that simply cant be overcome. And of course all would be forgiven if only the thing were funny. It is not. Arthur is still a good-natured drunkard When he and his chauffeur Bitterman (Luis Guzman) take Arthurs Batmobile on a tear through Lower Manhattan and collide with the Wall Street Bull (whose anatomical correctness is the movies first ""joke"" and an indication of where were going) even the cops are happy to see him--although you suspect that Arthurs barracuda-impersonator of a mother Vivienne (Geraldine James) is making large and frequent contributions to the Patrolmens Benevolent Association. Vivienne wants Arthur to marry Susan (Jennifer Garner) because the voracious Susan is just what the family firm needs to maintain the kind of client confidence and loyalty the companys heir presumptive is causing to evaporate like last New Years tequila shooter. Arthur is despondent at the prospect that his lifes work i.e. despoiling women and Manhattan will be interrupted. But under his mothers threat of instant poverty he becomes affianced anyway at an engagement party that almost makes one sympathetic for Susan (Ms. Garner is quite the convincing villainess). Then--ta-da--Arthur rescues an about-to-be-arrested damsel in distress Naomi (""mumblecore"" maiden Greta Gerwig) a Grand Central Terminal tour guide who lacks a city permit but has a personality Arthur cant resist. The police--again the police--practically hail the happy couple a cab. And our heros transition from tottering reprobate to upstanding citizen is under way. Was Arthur ever really happy? That of course is--and was--the question. Mr. Moores Arthur was so busy laughing at his own jokes it was hard not to laugh along with him. But theres nothing infectious comedically speaking at least about Mr. Brands Arthur. The dialogue is virtually wit-free. All playfulness is forced. In a feeble concession to the times Arthur has to see the light long before its dramatically necessary which burdens what should be a silly comedy with a ball and chain of righteousness. Even Helen Mirren a casting choice so obvious it hurts cant alchemize the role of Hobson (which won John Gielgud an Oscar) into much besides a humorless scold. And even for a New York fantasy the situations are ridiculous enough to be offensive At one point Arthur ""rents"" the cavernous main concourse of Grand Central so he and Naomi can dine there alone. Its too absurd an idea even to be cute and the admission that hes delayed 100 commuter trains in order to pull off his little stunt exemplifies the tone-deafness that affects the whole enterprise. Alcohol and ostentation? Not a recipe for a lot of laughs. ENLARGE Dennis Quaid and AnnaSophia Robb in Soul Surfer. TriStar Soul Surfer No one actually walks on water during the fact-based sports drama ""Soul Surfer"" but the Christian signifiers arrive with the regularity of waves slamming against the Hawaiian shoreline. It was there in 2003 that up-and-coming teen surfer Bethany Hamilton lost an arm in a shark attack and not only recovered but went on to surf competitively again. Its a great story one told with a great deal of polish and passion by director Sean McNamara adapted from Ms. Hamiltons memoir (co-written with Sheryl Berk and Rich Bundschuh). The movie is bright blue and buoyant. And it has a religious agenda as wide as the ocean. Which does not of course make ""Soul Surfer"" a bad movie. Far from it. Even if you instinctively resist the kind of subtle proselytizing that goes on throughout the film--the prayers the hymns the Bibles the implied heavenly guidance the prominent placement of the evangelical organization World Vision--its bubbling optimism and spectacular scenery are hard not to like. But ""Soul Surfer"" is also part of a growing movement dedicated to making and distributing Christian films in the mainstream films that dont advertise their spirituality but carry a very distinct religious message nonetheless. And once your antennae are up of course everything becomes symbolic. The shark attack for instance comes almost directly after Bethany--given an energetic portrayal by AnnaSophia Robb--decides not to go on a church charity trip organized by her pastor Sarah (country music star Carrie Underwood). Having her pay a price for choosing the good of her surfing sponsor over the good of the poor in Mexico is rather graceless as storytelling goes. It seems oddly coincidental too that in a movie teeming with churchly blondes including Bethanys mother (Helen Hunt) the one meanspirited character in the movie--Bethanys rival Malina Birch (Sonya Balmores Chung)--is also the darkest of skin and blackest of hair. She also wears black in case youve missed the point. ENLARGE Saoirse Ronan in Hanna. Focus Features Hanna A very different kind of blonde is at the center of the Joe Wrights globe-trotting assassin thriller ""Hanna"" which before collapsing into itself like a black hole is one moody shiny exciting romp. A major departure for a director known for very proper British fare--including ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Atonement""--""Hanna"" is quite the improper little package stylish rich in singular images and one that carries itself with both the bravado of a spy thriller and the winsomeness of a fairy tale. It is a childs story after all albeit with a twist Hanna (Saoirse Ronan) has been raised in the forests of northern Finland by her father ex-CIA agent Erik (Eric Bana) to be the worlds most efficient assassin an expert in weaponry martial arts and strategy. She has killer instinct to spare. Given its fantastic elements ""Hanna"" is on a certain level ridiculous. But the way Mr. Wright conjures his images and parcels out his narrative is hypnotic and so seductive that wherever the film is heading we want to follow. The mission for which Hanna has been trained involves a particularly unpleasant and lethal operative named Marissa Wiegler (Cate Blanchett at her most lunatic) whose connections with Erik are old and baroque. The reasons Marissa wants Hanna in her clutches and what the girls history means amid all those flashbacks are less important than the momentum of Mr. Wrights storytelling and action. The problem as it often is with any vehicle operating at high velocity is loss of traction The increasingly implausible ""Hanna"" cant slow down and ultimately hits the wall of our disbelief. The result? Flaming wreckage. One wants to like ""Hanna"" for all its thrills and good looks and the performance by the young Ms. Ronan (who received an Oscar nomination for ""Atonement""). Also for Mr. Wrights willingness to take risks which in this case dont quite pay off. Watch a clip from ""Born to Be Wild"" a 3D IMAX documentary about orphaned elephants and orangoutangs narrated by Morgan Freeman. Born to Be Wild 3D For those still wondering what in the world 3-D is good for the answer is nature--specifically ""Born to Be Wild 3D"" a moving engaging and revelatory IMAX attraction with two heroines and a crowd of charming beasts. Swinging back and forth between Kenya and Borneo director David Lickley and yes narrator Morgan Freeman tell--and more importantly show--the work of Daphne M. Sheldrick who rescues baby elephants whose parents have been killed by poachers; and primatologist Birute Mary Galdikas who adopts orphaned orangutans eventually freeing them into the rainforest of Borneo. The work of Ms. Galdikas and Ms. Sheldrick in returning wild animals to a wild state is the point of the movie though the two women are not really its stars. Those would be the apes and elephants a cast of happy sad playful incorrigible children who when they stare into the camera communicate an eerily profound connection with the viewer. They seem almost human as cliched as that may sound and that magic seems possible only via the technology used in making this 3-D animal attraction a movie that provides such an intimate look at the animals it could well put zoos out of business. Considering the content of so much of what passes for nature entertainment it need to be noted that this movie is entirely kid- and squeamish-adult friendly; no mammals are injured nor will they be upset during the viewing of this motion picture. --John Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is away. DVD FOCUS The Lost Weekend (1945) This remains the best-known and most influential movie about the ravages of alcoholism a film that won Oscars for star Ray Milland screenwriter Charles Brackett and director Billy Wilder who was inspired to make the film by author Raymond Chandler (who fell off the wagon during the making of ""Double Indemnity""). One of only two films to win both the Academy Award for Best Picture and the Cannes Film Festivals Palme dOr (the other was ""Marty"") it incorporated a number of pioneering visual effects co-starred Jane Wyman and was based on a story by Charles R. Jackson. The Thin Man (1934) A deep and enduring fondness for martinis never kept Nick Charles (William Powell) from solving a murder case and wife Nora (Myrna Loy) was never more than a few drinks behind over the course of six delightfully marinated mystery/comedies made by the pair through 1947. Based on the detective novel by Dashiell Hammett (and supposedly based on his relationship with Lillian Hellman) the movie and its sequels reflected a lingering sense of post-Prohibition joy in all the liquor consumed by Nick and Nora who could probably have drunk the casts of ""Animal House"" ""Cocktail"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" under the table. Drunks (1995) A little more humor would probably have helped this multicharacter drama starring comedian Richard Lewis although its portrayal of an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting is raw and unfiltered. Mr. Lewis plays Jim whose struggle is the centerpiece of the movie that also features Amanda Plummer Parker Posey Dianne Wiest Spalding Gray and perhaps most memorably Faye Dunaway all of whom portray characters trying to wrestle demon rum to the floor.

"Arthur Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Russell_brandMOVIE REVIEW The best they can do?Theres not much to be charmed about in this sterile remake of the foibles of a drunken playboy billionaire. Not even the force of Russell Brand and Helen Mirren can lift a weak script.April 08 2011|BETSY SHARKEY | FILM CRITIC No doubt it looked good on paper. Remake the Oscar-winning comedy ""Arthur."" Sub in Britains hot comic flasher Russell Brand as the drunken billionaire playboy that Dudley Moore made so effortlessly appealing in the 80s Cinderella story. Instead of John Gielguds bitingly brilliant butler have the bad boy be tended by Britains reigning queen Helen Mirren. The cherry on top a current cover of ""Arthurs Theme"" -- you know ""When you get caught between the moon and New York City....""But paper and possibilities do not a movie make. Im guessing even Christopher Cross is cross.Where to begin with what went wrong when just about everything did? For those unfamiliar with the story Arthur (Brand) is a big boy with family money who is throwing away his life and considerable amounts of cash on booze and broads. Hobson (Mirren) is the nanny who picks up after him. His dilemma Should he choose the penniless girl he loves and lose his inheritance or acquiesce to family demands and marry the rich girl he doesnt? Basically will this inebriated Peter Pan grow up and sober up?But ""Arthurs"" problems actually begin with Peter Baynhams update (downgrade?) of writer-director Steve Gordons original screenplay which wasnt perfect to begin with. Baynham was one of four hands stirring the very inventive pot of 2006s ""Borat"" But where that film was the epitome of political incorrectness in the best possible way ""Arthurs"" been strangely cleaned up. For The Record Los Angeles Times Thursday April 14 2011 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 4 News Desk 1 inches; 27 words Type of Material Correction ""Arthur"" A review of ""Arthur"" in the April 8 Calendar section said that the films director of photography Uta Briesewitz ""keeps his distance."" Briesewitz is a woman."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;The sanitizing is handled so artlessly it seems driven by fear of offending rather than by any true cultural sensitivity. So for the addiction crowd theres a new AA story line. In deference to celebs with embarrassing shoplifting tendencies instead of the clever tie-snatching that creates the meet-cute between Arthur and Liza Minnellis hard-working waitress Linda theres Greta Gerwig -- badly underused but with a better name Naomi -- and a lesser crime a tour guide permit infraction. Where Linda hopes to be an actress Naomi wants to write and illustrate childrens books. Its all very nice.Whatever the story issues and there are more the lions share of the grief will have to go to director Jason Winer -- I think he did get caught between the moon and New York City.Though ""Arthur"" is Winers first feature film its not as if hes never been in the directors chair having helped shape ABCs exceedingly satisfying comedy ""Modern Family."" What works there is exactly what undercuts ""Arthur."" Winer it turns out is a master of small tightly constructed moments and when those come along the director does an excellent job of capturing the eccentric comic brand of Brand.But the action and narrative interplay are not strong enough to hold up the sheer weight of a film. Instead there are sags so deep they would defy even the best plastic surgeons scalpel. Director of photography Uta Briesewitz perhaps sensing a catastrophe in the making keeps his distance. There are lots of wide shots which dilute the emotional moments so necessary to balance Arthurs debauchery particularly in a modern day grown tired of substance-abuse-induced tabloid train wrecks.Brand an ingenious comic on his best days has his moments. But his Arthur is more brutish than boyish and harder to love. However if youre in the mood to watch him make the difficult journey from substance-abusing entitlement to human being youll find a far more nuanced and affecting performance as the rock renegade in writer-director Nicholas Stollers ""Get Him to the Greek.""The women in the film are all squandered. Gerwig whose flightiness was so charming in ""Greenberg"" simply comes untethered here. No chemistry no connection with Brand. Jennifer Garner who plays the cachet-climbing fiancee that Arthur so dislikes goes to such extremes you wonder if she was told this was a cage-fighting film. (The role of maniacally protective father so crafty in Stephen Elliotts hands in the original was bleached and shrunk before Nick Nolte had a chance.)Meanwhile Mirren that grande dame of cinema just seems tired. And who could blame her? Shes in the midst of this disaster literally and figuratively dying right in front of us.

Warner Bros. Pictures Russell Brand takes up the Dudley Moore role of charming drunk whose love interest could cost him his inheritance. Helen Mirren plays his nanny. EnlargeClose Warner Bros. Pictures Russell Brand takes up the Dudley Moore role of charming drunk whose love interest could cost him his inheritance. Helen Mirren plays his nanny. His best performance to date was in 2008s Forgetting Sarah Marshallin a very funny supporting role as a self-indulgent British rocker. Then came the wildly uneven Get Him to the Greek about the antics of that same rock star. The charm started to wear thin. And now as the eponymous star of Arthur he would be well-advised to go back to well-chosen bit parts. Its not that Brand doesnt have appeal. Hes intermittently amusing and even has bouts of sweetness. But the movie -- about a charming drunk who will lose his huge trust fund if he doesnt marry rich -- is at best mediocre. Why someone decided it was a good idea to repurpose this minor (if popular) 1981 comedy with Brand and the estimable Helen Mirren in the John Gielgud sharp-tongued butler role is mystifying. Despite his cockney-accented verbosity Brand does not convey the effortless conviviality that Dudley Moore did in the part. ODD COUPLE Mirrren and Brand Brand can easily play the overgrown adolescent dithering sot. But is this really an adorable character? Moores Arthur was mildly entertaining even oddly quaint three decades ago. Now the guy just seems out of touch. The filmmakers must have realized a movie about an inebriated spendthrift might not sit as well with recession-era audiences. So they rebooted the immature egomaniac adding a rogue philanthropic streak and threw him in AA to clean up. Where Moore was unapologetically drunk with a capital D Brand is more PC -- he gets sober renouncing his dissolute life of nameless hook-ups. About the movie Arthur  out of fourStars Russell Brand Helen Mirren Jennifer Garner Greta Gerwig Luis Guzman Nick Nolte Director Jason Winer Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for alcohol use throughout sexual content language and some drug references Running time 1 hour 49 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Though its a challenge to fashion a movie around a sloshed hero -- and cleaning up his act is laudable -- it gives the movie even less edge. And speaking of edge deficiency the movie recycles Christopher Cross cloying ""Arthurs Theme"" (Best That You Can Do) a tune far better forgotten. Arthur lives in palatial digs. His nanny Hobson (Mirren) is around to make sardonic quips. While Mirren has some drily witty lines shes a tad too kindly to pull off the acerbic dismissals that Gielgud did making Arthurs revised saga sloshily sentimental. Speaking of sentiment Arthur falls for Naomi (Greta Gerwig) a sweet blonde who we know is Hollywoods version of quirky because she wears ankle socks with heels and short Minnie Mouse-style dresses. She also runs tours of Grand Central Terminal without a license. What an eccentric scofflaw Arthur is instantly smitten. But even at the height of their romance they have little chemistry. In fact Brand might as well be doing a one-man show for all he connects with his co-stars. Gerwig so good in Greenberg and other indie films comes off bland and slightly befuddled. Arthurs mother (Geraldine James) arranges a propitious marriage for her carousing son with the ambitious Susan (Jennifer Garner) the daughter of a construction magnate (Nick Nolte). When Arthur balks at the forced union his mother threatens to take away his fortune. Guess who hell end up with. Brand seems to channel Moore in some of his speech patterns. Scanning his pale face as he garrulously delivers his lines one wonders is there more behind those dark eyes some greater depth and originality within? Well never know the answer until Brand takes on something other than remakes of the same tired characters. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Lets enumerate starting with the more general reasons and then getting more specific.Right at the top of this heap of a remake is that it is another remake. The 1981 original was a thoroughly mediocre comedy redeemed only by the charm and timing abounding between Dudley Moore as the spoiled and soused heir and Sir John Gielgud as his faithful butler.But this new version never shows any interest in trying to improve on the original. It plays as another gesture of lazy cynicism from a Hollywood machine that cant bother coming up with new ideas or fresh takes on old ones and instead assumes that todays moviegoing audience is either too young to know or too old to care.Then there is the problem of how dated the originals conceit was Nearly all the laughs are generated by Arthurs nonstop binge drinking. Bottle ever in his hand words ever slurring from his mouth falling about a tony restaurant or weaving down a highway Arthur was what our culture of addiction and recovery has since taught us to recognize as an alcoholic.From the opening moment when Russell Brand as the 21st-century Arthur starts stuffing liquor bottles into the utility belt of his Batman costume the movie presents him as addictions version of a unicorn a lovable charming and most of all hilarious drunk. While this is a portrayal Charlie Sheen would no doubt commend as ""winning"" and lead Sheen to pronounce Arthur a fellow warlock it flies in the face of not just the lessons to be learned in shows from Celebrity Rehab to Intervention but also to the social forces driving their popularity.The twist here of course is that Arthur is fabulously unfathomably rich heir to a family fortune that presumably unfetters him from the realities that send lesser drunks crashing down to meet their bottoms. The movie spends a great deal of time cataloging Arthurs madcap indulgences and fanciful toys. He collects movie cars -- hence the Batmobile not to mention Back to the Futures DeLorean and Scooby-Doos Mystery Machine -- and when he wants to impress his true love he rents Grand Central Station and fills it with rose petals and acrobats. ""This is what money is for"" Arthur says as if declaring his reason for being ""creating excitement and joy.""If youre in the mood for escapist hokum then Arthur is your boy. But if as unemployment abounds and a government shutdown looms you cant help but think that money is for things like buying food and paying bills and sleeping indoors then Arthur may get on your nerves.Then finally there is the movies cast and script. Brand does his valiant vainglorious best to animate this movie but hes undercut by a slapdash story and cut-and-paste dialogue. The most animated scene happens in his private screening room where classic Looney Tunes shorts (in this case Pepe Le Pew) are always on. About the only nod to updating is a gender switch so that Gielguds Hobson becomes Helen Mirrens Hobson. But since the film is almost creepily faithful to the essential chemistry of the Hobson-Arthur relationship it doesnt go anywhere and Mirren cant match Gielguds stern exterior or the lovely warmth just beneath it.Jennifer Garner is a little too successful in making her Susan Arthurs anti-love interest utterly hateful. The only casting improvement over the original is Greta Gerwig as Arthurs beloved Naomi. Finding an actress to best Liza Minnelli at playing a beautiful easy-to-fall-in-love-with gal -- thats a challenge even this Arthur can manage.ArthurD Starring Russell Brand Helen Mirren Jennifer Garner and Greta Gerwig.

Pictures As Arthur Bach the boozy multimillionaire in the 1981 comedy Arthur Dudley Moore played drunk like one of those Looney Tunes characters who fall into a barrel of liquor and come out hiccuping bubbles. Its a broad and frankly grating performance but beyond the slurred speech and cockeyed walk Moore added a cackle that revealed more about his character than merely how much vodka hed ingested. Because its not just any old drunken cackle but a mirthless cackle -- a sign that this spoiled blue blood painting the town every night isnt having any fun doing it. Of the myriad things the new remake of Arthur gets wrong missing Arthurs sadness may be the most damaging. Stepping in for Moore Russell Brand has no trouble playing a hard-partying man-child; hes done it at least twice on film after all as the brash showboating rock star in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and its spinoff Get Him To The Greek. He doesnt do pathos nearly as well. Rather than an Arthur whos insulated by his wealth and feelings of abandonment Brands version is a noxiously whimsical creature who uses his money to make dreams come true. So when it comes time to feel sorry for poor Arthur -- which is often since the remake like the original offers three parts sentiment to one part comedy -- the emotions never resonate. Among the many alterations to the 81 Arthur -- few of them an improvement -- the most prominent is Helen Mirrens casting as Hobson Arthurs keeper the role that won John Gielgud an Oscar for his dry scabrous wit. Aside from one unfortunate reference to breast-feeding changing Hobsons job from butler to nanny doesnt alter the dynamic one bit and what little fun the new Arthur offers comes from the way Mirren perfectly mimics both Gielguds comic disdain and that reassuring twinkle in his eyes. The film simply doesnt provide an Arthur worthy of her. The story more or less touches the same bases To keep his high-nine-figure inheritance Arthur must agree to an arranged marriage to Susan (Jennifer Garner) a woman of elite stock who promises to bring some stability to his life -- and to the skittish investors who fear for the family business. When Arthur instead falls in love with Naomi (Greta Gerwig) a humble tour guide who lives with her father in Queens he considers giving up his money for love. (Or perhaps contriving to have it both ways.) i As a tour guide whose charms threaten to derail marriage plans that are more business than pleasure Greta Gerwig steps into the part played by Liza Minnelli in the original. Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures As a tour guide whose charms threaten to derail marriage plans that are more business than pleasure Greta Gerwig steps into the part played by Liza Minnelli in the original. Barry Wetcher/Warner Bros. Pictures Much of what stands for comedy in Arthur is extravagant displays of wealth followed by mush-mouthed one-liners that barely register as jokes an opening sequence for instance has Arthur crashing a Batmobile and trying to slur his way out of a ticket. For the audience the attraction of this scene has less to do with Arthur being a particularly funny drunk than the fantasy of owning a Batmobile. So too with an impossibly elaborate date he stages for Naomi at an emptied-out Grand Central Station a romantic gesture measured in dollar signs. Worse still the remake sells out Arthurs blue-blood fiancee who in the 81 version was a bright attractive good-natured young woman who became collateral damage in his pursuit of Liza Minnellis working-class wisecracker. This Arthur cravenly turns Susan into a monstrous status-seeker making her less of a human being and thus much easier for Arthur to trample over in securing a meaningful adult relationship. In a particular low point Garner should have received hazard pay for a humiliating sequence in which she throws herself at him only to be unexpectedly diverted -- clang -- when her metal bustier is drawn to the underside of his magnetically charged hoverbed. Ah a hoverbed. Wouldnt it be dreamy to own one of those? In this Arthur the ways money is spent prove far more enchanting than the tiresome sprite whos doing the spending.

Might as well burn bundles of cash. Hes just that rich.Then his stern mother (Geraldine James) arranges a shotgun engagement with a briskly ambitious heiress (Jennifer Garner) the plan being that she will whip him into shape and off the gossip pages.As in the original the mean matriarch could not have chosen a worse time to marry him off because Arthur has inexplicably fallen for the most unlikely girl (Greta Gerwig) a ditz from the unspeakable outer boroughs.This is the point where Arthurs jolly spell begins unraveling. The romance between Brand and Gerwig is almost insultingly unconvincing.You didnt quite buy Moore going gaga over a dA(c)classA(c) Liza Minnelli in the 1981 film either. But at least they were the same height.The quips fly fast and fetchingly through the first part of this frothy comedy. Many of them are delivered with dry sarcasm by Helen Mirren taking the John Gielgud role as Arthurs starched minder.The last part of Arthur slogs under an unfortunate burden of sentiment and sincerity.The original Arthur was a happy dipso. We no longer believe in such a creature. The remake must lay bare the psychological underpinnings of Arthurs compulsion.These days we know what do with drunks Send them to meetings.Our enlightened understanding of addiction makes for a sad and sappy last act for Arthur. Hate to say it but the guy was a lot more fun when he was drinking.Contact staff writer David Hiltbrand at 215-854-4552 or dhiltbrandphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + The new remake of ""Arthur is a thin copy of the 1981 original. But it has a few things going for it. Russell Brand for instance makes his best case for himself as a suitable alternative to the dude-ification of American comedy. Brand lands his blows by pretending to have no idea how to box. He gets that hes amusing but doesnt feel the need to rub our noses in it with mania or lavish physical antics. In that sense hes old funny.Arthur is a filthy rich alcoholic Englishman New Yorker who passes his time spending money and carousing often despite the ministrations of his nanny a stern Brit named Hobson whom Helen Mirren plays with a blend of cashmere and steel something else the movie has in its favor. She and Brand share a rapport that feels true enough to skirt the glacial pacing and silly plot. He has no idea how much he exasperates her. Theyre not nearly as good together or as surprising apart as Dudley Moore and John Gielgud as Arthurs butler were in the original movie. They were Wooster and Jeeves. Brand and Mirren are Harry Potter and Dumbledore.The story is essentially the same as it was 30 years ago only its been drawn against the backdrop of megabusiness. Arthur risks losing access to his fortune unless he marries Susan (Jennifer Garner) the executive his CEO mother (Geraldine James) has selected for him. Susan is a ladder-climbing vixen who understands the opportunity at hand Its just another merger. Hes free to have a mistress if he chooses and the movie offers Naomi (Greta Gerwig) as just the right girl -- a quirky unlicensed tour guide and aspiring childrens book author from Queens. (Women in the movies are never novelists anymore.)The dialogue in Peter Baynhams script occasionally fizzes with put-downs and cattiness. Hobson describes one of her bosss adventures as ""a safari into the pointless. Its obvious Baynham and Brand who appears to be improvising most of his scenes have taken care to contribute an array of snobbery that manages to have fun with anyone whos not like him. A tourist in a sun hat is called the ""Caribbean Diane Keaton. From his penthouse bubble baths Arthur aims binoculars at the street sees two beatniks holding hands and describes them as ""the lesbian Simon and Garfunkel. We are all his toys. (Evander Holyfield makes house calls a playdate with Kanye West is on the calendar and Luis Guzman plays Arthurs chauffeur and right-hand man.) Moores version really got a kick from being among average people. Brands appears to have just landed on Earth in the magnetic space bed he sleeps in. His entire performance is exposed as a fraud in a wonderful scene in which Arthur stands in a roomful of actual pitiless children. The comedies of the early 1980s were really reaching back to the screwball farces of the 1930s to think about how to reframe matters of class and gender and psychology of that time. Steve Gordons original ""Arthur wasnt deep but it had a real tender sadness. Everyone is complicit in Arthurs self-loathing yet self-affirming drunkenness no one more so than the audience. You didnt want to see Moore temper his performance with sobriety. Drinking was the source of his tremendous comedic strength (its still a very funny one-note achievement). The prospect of him without alcohol was disillusioning like seeing a star without her makeup.This movie doesnt seem to know why Arthur drinks. Only occasionally does Brand even appear to be drunk. (Nick Nolte plays Susans father and at 70 he now looks like a less than hale future Matt Damon. Nolte conducts his two scenes in the worrying condition of a far more convincing substance abuser.) Throughout Brands Arthur looks ready for photo shoots with his clear complexion tailored suits and neatly tended tresses. Moore often looked like his face was going to slide off his head.Arthurs antics -- wild parties caroming through Manhattan in a Batmobile -- make investors in the familys corporation nervous. The original movie invented Susan to join two fortunes and dry Arthur out. In the new version the part allows Garner to play a sexual predator. Even before shes affixed to the magnetic bottom of Arthurs spacecraft bed in lingerie the part doesnt flatter her. By the end shes a gorgon. Gerwig meanwhile is an original comedian whos stuck being The Girl. Liza Minnelli played this part in the original and there was a sparkle of thrill-seeking and gold-digging in her enormous eyes. She was as attracted to the otherness of Arthurs class as he was attracted to hers. Naomi is too virtuous to be interesting.You never believe a minute of the remake which Jason Winer directed. Having Mirren play Gielguds part seems an even better idea than having her play Prospero in Julie Taymors ""The Tempest. But I could never accept that this tough compassionate woman would allow a man shes been nurturing for more than 30 years to become such a stupendous dependent. His failures would appear to be hers and its hard to believe that ""failure exists in this nannys vocabulary. Would decades of her care really have produced such a drunken childish slut? The genius of Gielguds performance which earned an Oscar was that he gave enough catty self-pity. He was pitiful for sticking by Arthur for so long and the pitifulness forged a kid of perverse affection. Hed fallen in love with Arthur. The emotional nature of Hobsons devotion now is vague. But surely the money is good.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com or followed on Twitter wesley_morris. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Beyond providing an unflinching look at what happens to those caught between the moon and New York City the 1981 comedy Arthur gave veteran comic actor Dudley Moore one of the best roles of his career as a drunken playboy cackling his way through a search for love. Though the movie--the single directorial effort from veteran television writer Steve Gordon who died the following year--is uneven Moore sells the performance with the sadness resting just behind the surface of his bleary eyes. Russell Brand steps into the role of Arthur Bach for the 2011 remake and while its one of the more reined-in performances of his short busy big-screen career Brands unvarying onscreen persona just doesnt do soulful. Any gestures toward maturity or pleas for understanding feel like part of the act. It isnt a bad act in all contexts. Brand can be funny in supporting parts. But he doesnt yet know how to command a front-and-center role and Arthur groans with the effort from its first moments which find Brands exuberant playboy donning a Batman costume and commanding his put-upon chauffeur (Luis Guzman) to drive him through the streets of Manhattan in the Batmobile. Not letting a mere arrest stop his partying he turns the evening into a wild debauch letting his commanding lifelong nanny (Helen Mirren stepping into the John Gielgud role) sweep in to pick up the pieces as always. Predictably Mirren is the best part of the film providing a calm center to anchor the antics including those that follow once Brand caves to the pressure of his cold mother (Geraldine James) and proposes to a pushy ambitious heiress (Jennifer Garner). But could a chance meeting with a working-class tour guide (Greta Gerwig) make him change his mind even if it means losing his fortune? Director Jason Winer (a Modern Family veteran making his feature debut) takes his time lurching to the answer filling the spaces not already occupied by broad performances with too much unearned sentiment and too few laughs. Sluggish and shapeless Arthur has a few nice moments--such as a date at an emptied-out Grand Central--but theyre overwhelmed by Brands braying and Garners embarrassing turn as a high-class shrew. Yet for all the obvious effort of those performances the film around them ends up feeling unforgivably bland. Its a contemporary rom-com nothing dressed up in ill-fitting screwball clothes.

"Arthur review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Walking a straighter lineArthur -- 2.5 starsApril 07 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticFrom one perspective the well-lubricated yet stiff-jointed 1981 comedy ""Arthur"" the one about the millionaire Manhattan drunkard played by Dudley Moore was ripe for a remake. It scored a huge popular success early in the Reagan era when unexamined wealth was king. And because the movie which harkens back to Depression-era wish-fulfillment fantasies holds up only fitfully well a generation later mostly in the scenes between Moore and John Gielgud (who won an Oscar as Arthurs manservant) a remake has a fighting chance of bettering its source material. The new ""Arthur"" which is blobby and a bit of a mess but offers a fair number of laughs will live or die at the box office on Russell Brands brand of louche comic authority and on how audiences take to it in this retro-rich-drunk context. In the original Moores alcoholic playboy fell in love with a waitress/actress/shoplifter played by Liza Minnelli. As retooled for our more sober era by screenwriter Peter Baynham Arthur falls for a sweet unlicensed Manhattan tour guide played by Greta Gerwig. The title character is once again engaged to marry a more socially and financially expedient selection of human here played as a brittle harridan by Jennifer Garner. Hobson the ""help"" has switched genders going from Gielgud in the first version to Helen Mirren above right in the remake. Are the results funny? In the margins yes. Brand so choice as the other man in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is best in small doses and sloshed asides. (Ordering at a fancy restaurant ""A cauldron of tequila and a spoon please."") He brings a genially debauched edge to the role. Gerwig seen lately in ""Greenberg"" and quite wonderful in her absence of guile predictable rhythms and seeming calculation has a way of forcing her co-stars to cut to the heart of things and keep it honest. This is handy considering the uneven material. The writing in their introductory scenes followed by an extravagant first date in Grand Central Station gets awfully sticky. Heres where the new ""Arthur"" runs into problems sidestepped (at least according to the gross receipts) by the 81 edition. It would be nearly unthinkable and at the very least a dubious challenge for a commercial romantic comedy to embrace a career alcoholics baseline adorability in the early 21st century. Thus director Jason Winers film taken from Baynhams script makes a considerable deal about Arthurs heading into Alcoholics Anonymous. (In ""Get Him to the Greek"" Brand played a rougher sort of libertine dealing with similar ""issues"" to use a word Mirrens character uses.) This takes the material a few steps away from the realm of retro-screwball romance and into a more seriocomic realm. In theory Im for it; the first ""Arthur"" came at the very tail end of what might be called ""the late Foster Brooks era"" when drunks were basically amusing rather than a societal headache. But it makes the comedy tricky. (Also its weird to see aggressive product placement for Makers Mark in a story that ends up in AA.) The real drawback with Winers film -- which is nonetheless more amusing than the trailers suggest -- is visual. The movie favors tight close-ups and telephoto lenses; were always a little too close for comfort. The movie boasts all sorts of nice faces to be sure. But when actors try to get a little back-and-forth going and maximize whatever banter theyre given chop-chop close-ups and reaction shots become wearisome. Physical comedy is not this ""Arthurs"" strong suit. It works best to the degree it works when Brand Gerwig and Mirren are allowed breathing room. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG-13 (for alcohol use throughout sexual content language and some drug references) Cast Russell Brand (Arthur); Helen Mirren (Hobson); Greta Gerwig (Naomi); Jennifer Garner (Susan); Luis Guzman (Bitterman); Nick Nolte (Burt); Geraldine James (Vivienne) Credits Directed by Jason Winer; written by Peter Baynham based on the Steve Gordon screenplay ""Arthur""; produced by Larry Brezner Kevin McCormick Chris Bender and Michael Tadross.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Arthur Video Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2011 The puerile Dudley Moore comedy from 1981 about a poor little rich boy on a perpetual bender has been turned into a vehicle for the tight-trousered impossibly beautiful British comedian Russell Brand. His snotty improvised quips are good for a few laughs though three decades of skyrocketing income inequality have soured the comedy of Arthurs astronomically expensive self-indulgences. (They dont seem far removed from things you actually read about now.) The spoiled heir falls in love with a working-class woman (Greta Gerwig all legs) and must choose between her and his wealth; as in the original this conflict turns out to be a tease and Arthur gets to have his cake and eat it too. Improv Olympic alumnus Jason Winer directed; with Jennifer Garner Luis Guzman Nick Nolte and Helen Mirren inheriting the John Gielgud role as Arthurs long-suffering servant. By J.R.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews Arthur in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers"" The epidemic continues with the limp-dick remake of 1981s Arthur starring Russell Brand in the happy-drunk role indelibly created by Dudley Moore. Sounds promising but it ends in disaster. Brand is a Brit firecracker well suited to playing Arthur Bach a Manhattan playboy who dulls his lack of purpose with booze. But the pale-imitation script by Peter Baynham (Borat) never lets him rip. Helen Mirren is also trapped. As Hobson Arthurs nanny Dame Helen is meant to fill in for Sir John Gielgud who won an Oscar as Arthurs acidly funny butler. Im not feeling awards this time. Video Russell Brand Reveals His Most Badass Brushes With Death In the age of rehab self-destructive celebs (from Lohan to Sheen) inspire more pity than smiles. Brand himself a recovering alcoholic works strenuously to make us root for Arthurs redemption by rejecting marriage to grasping Susan (Jennifer Garner) in favor of true love with sweet Naomi (a lovely low-key Greta Gerwig). And Mirren constantly reminds us (sniff sniff) that Arthur is still an unloved child. The 11 Best Comedian-Musicians That dog wont hunt. Remakes seldom do. Director Jason Winer (TVs Modern Family) in his feature debut cant find the tonal balance that Steve Gordon did in the original. Gordon who died shortly after the first Arthur never had to see the luckless 1988 sequel that made his beloved characters seem like strangers. The new Arthur insipid when it should be infectious leaves the same deadly impression.

Arthur Fair Director Jason Winer. Cast Russell Brand Helen Mirren Greta Gerwig. Rating PG-13 for alcohol use throughout sexual content language and some drug references. Movie remakes we didnt need Guide to this weeks new releases Interview Russell Brand on remaking Arthur Whichever side of that divide you find yourself on will determine how much you like director Jason Winers remake of ""Arthur"" with Brand stepping into the Dudley Moore role of the boozing womanizing heir whose life is devoted to ever-escalating hedonism until he finds love. It seems like an odd choice for a remake 30 years down the line as Moores portrayal is one of his best and best-known roles. But if you must Brand is the man for the job. So too evidently is Helen Mirren. She steps into the role of Hobson for which John Gielgud won an Oscar in the original. Mirren is never anything but good but writer Peter Baynham doesnt serve up the withering one-liners Gielguld knocked out of the park in the original. The basic story remains the same Arthur is a fun-loving drunk spectacularly ill-equipped to run the family business. After another round of Arthur busily making scandalous headlines his mother Vivienne (Geraldine James) issues an ultimatum Marry the cold calculating Susan (Jennifer Garner) or shell cut him off from his 950 million slice of the family fortune. Its while Arthur is resigning himself to his fate that he meets Naomi (Greta Gerwig) who leads fake tours of Grand Central Station to make ends meet. Arthur is smitten but hes also stuck. If he marries Susan hell be rich and miserable. If he pursues Naomi hell be happy and broke. Neither combination sounds especially promising but true love has a way of winning out. Concessions have been made to the passage of time. Arthur is still a drunk but Alcoholics Anonymous plays a role this time. The word ""recession"" is tossed around a bit; cash is tossed around to ease its effects. These do nothing to improve the film. Either Arthur is a full-on hedonist or hes not. ""Arthur"" in both versions works only as a comedic fantasy. Excessive realism kills the effect. Gerwig always is welcome; she gives Naomi some spunk. Garner plays a one-dimensional shrew nothing more. One salivates at the notion of Mirren being given the Gielgud-quality lines but alas thats not the case. The first film wasnt exactly subtle but the late Steve Gordon who wrote and directed it got a lot of mileage out of smart cuts such as when the father of the Naomi character (Linda in the original played by Liza Minnelli) cries when he learns Arthur has broken up with his daughter. Winers film employs little of that sort of technique relying perhaps too much on Brands manic persona for most of the films energy. Luckily for Winer Brand has energy to spare particularly in off-the-cuff throwaway lines that seem improvised though who knows? Brand ultimately cant make a watered-down ""Arthur"" as sweetly charming as the original but he certainly makes it better than it would have been otherwise.

"ARTHUR (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review ARTHUR (PG-13) Dudley Moore has never been more missed than in this laugh-free remake of the 1980s classic. Share Print Save to your profile By Colin Covert | Star Tribune4/6/2011 If you must see Arthur choose a theater that serves alcohol. Youll need it.Like a 3-D adventure this fiasco is best viewed through beer goggles.A team of moviemakers takes millions of dollars a classic comedy and a sheet of tracing paper and produces a travesty. They had the blueprint for a great movie in the 1981 Dudley Moore-John Gielgud Arthur. Sublime performances. Wicked jokes. The soulful relationship between the rich spoiled drunk and his sarcastic guardian. The whole algorithm was there. Their job was just to reproduce it faithfully. And they couldnt. My head hurts. Arthur is not a did-it-all-go-wrong calamity. Its basic design flaw is clear Russell Brand doesnt have much talent for vulnerability. As Arthur Bach perpetually sozzled heir of a dragon-lady businesswoman he is presented as a poor little rich boy using booze as a shield against a life of alienation. This is a bit like casting Jason Statham as a sensitive Nobel Prize winner.Brand a comic in the Ricky Gervais-Steve Coogan line of inflated self-regard is best when hes obnoxious. In Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek he was a volatile compound of libido entitlement and I.Q. He was appalling and very funny. In Arthur hes required to be a fabulously wealthy underdog. Brand has given up more than his whiskers to play the soft warm-and-human center of this movie. He has sacrificed vital parts of his comic anatomy if you know what I mean and I think you do.Arthur living in a Manhattan penthouse playpen makes the frivolous life of an upper-class twit look like a drag. He has a fleet of iconic movie cars but no one except his dim-witted butler to go cruising with. He has a magnetically levitating bed and many hookers but no one to love. When his fire-breathing mother tries to force him into a financially advantageous marriage with a construction heiress Arthur rebels by falling for a ditsy tourist guide. Will he choose his billion-dollar inheritance or true love? Will he renounce drink through AA? Will the denouement be a huge cop-out? Will the pain never end?Brand plays drunkenness as a kind of elevated nonchalance but never achieves the happy-go-lucky verve of Moore or Johnny Depps Capt. Jack Sparrow. He capers down the streets of Manhattan in a top hat waving his scarecrow arms as if auditioning for a pantomime Alice in Wonderland. As his steely socialite fiancee Jennifer Garner is so unpleasantly shrewish that one cringes whenever she returns to the screen. Indie movie pussycat Greta Gerwig plays the tender salt-of-the-earth Queens girl who could be Arthurs salvation. Shes not bad considering that the role is so gauzy a projection of masculine fantasies that the character is utterly lacking in energy and depth. Helen Mirren slumming in the role of Arthurs stern but doting nanny is more vividly alive than the rest of the cast even when the script requires her to wear a Darth Vader helmet and command ""Wash your winkie."" Gielgud won an Oscar in the original film; if there were an award for graceful acting in a disaster Mirren could clear a space on her shelf right now.

(Warner Bros. Pictures) Barry Wetcher Russell Brand stars in ""Arthur."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Arthur Arthur remake is a charmless dud BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic  joewilliamspost-dispatch.com  314-340-8344 Apr 7 2011 (...) Barry Wetcher Russell Brand and Helen Mirren star in ""Arthur."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) Barry Wetcher Russell Brand stars in ""Arthur."" (Warner Bros. Pictures) The original ""Arthur"" was harmless. The new one is charmless.In 1981 it was permissible to make a comedy about a drunken billionaire because the Me Generation didnt notice the damage that alcoholics and rich people could do. And Dudley Moore was disarmingly good-hearted and graceful.But 30 years later addiction and recession have taken such a toll that only a new perspective could redeem the story. Instead the producers of the remake have doubled down on a dubious concept. The trouble is the joker in their deck is two-dimensional. Russell Brand is a funny fellow with a personal history of overcoming substance abuse but theres little wit or wisdom in his performance as wealthy wastrel Arthur Bach.Arthur lives in a penthouse overlooking Central Park with his chauffeur Bitterman (Luis Guzman) and his nanny Hobson (Helen Mirren in the John Gielgud role). Neither of these supposed friends do anything to keep Arthur from wasting his money and brain cells so we get painful scenes such as Arthur outbidding himself at an art auction and crashing his Batmobile on the way to his mothers charity ball.His mother (Geraldine James) gives Arthur an ultimatum marry aspiring socialite Susan (Jennifer Garner grossly misused) or lose his inheritance. Instead Arthur falls for a penniless tour guide named Naomi (Greta Gerwig).As Arthur woos Naomi with toys and tries his hand at gainful employment shrewish Susan becomes more desperate the mother touts the practical benefits of adultery and Hobson goes tsk-tsk. Whereas Gielguds Hobson was droll Mirrens is merely sour. So when Hobson has a health crisis theres no emotional resonance. Surprisingly Gerwig steals the film from her better-known co-stars. As in ""Greenberg"" shes got a goodness that could buoy a foundering man whos receptive to help. But this Arthur is childish rather than childlike so Naomi becomes just another enabler.With such a thin excuse for a leading man ""Arthur"" is a dud.""Arthur""Two stars (out of four)  Rating PG-13  Run time 150  Content Excessive alcohol use strong language and some sexuality New version of Arthur rekindles the remake debate ""Arthur"" is the latest remake from Hollywood one in a long line of clones that range from the wonderful (""Heaven Can Wait"" and ""True Grit"") to the dreadful (""Godzilla"" and ""Psycho"").

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr DRUNKEN PLAYBOY Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in Arthur (Barry Wetcher) C+ Arthur Genre Comedy; Starring Russell Brand Jennifer Garner Greta Gerwig Helen Mirren; Director Jason Winer; Author Peter Baynham Steve Gordon; Release Date Wide 04/08/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 110; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted April 13 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT The first time I saw Russell Brand as the hilariously dissolute British quipster rock star in Forgetting Sarah Marshall (2008) I thought he was brilliant. He made the character so narcissistic yet so relaxed and at home in his self-absorption that he turned every line into a wicked off-kilter surprise. (He was my choice for best supporting actor of the year.) In last years Get Him to the Greek Brand played the same character with added screen time and he was still amusing only not quite as much -- less of Brand it turned out was more. Now in what seems like it should be a perfect piece of casting he stars in a remake of Arthur as a wealthy childish and perpetually drunken playboy (the role made so impishly charming 30 years ago by Dudley Moore). This time though I really started to wonder Why are we sitting and watching this dithering half-cocked egomaniac? The new Arthur is a feathery screwball satire competent on its own terms yet as the movie went on I found it increasingly hard to separate the characters self-indulgence from that of the actor playing him. Brand has long black hair parted in the middle eyes that pop out of his head but still seem to be gazing inward and a gummy leer of a smile that depending on the context can come off as sexy or slightly ghastly. He looks like the star of a 70s road-company production of Godspell and that flaked-out beatific image helps ground his comedy. It makes everything he says seem that much more irreverent. As Arthur who lives in an outrageous Fifth Avenue palace (its actually the grand old Pierre Hotel) Brand once again plays an inebriated hedonist in flight from the real world. Arthur drinks around the clock sleeps with every woman he can and dresses like Batman for a night on the town. (He owns a Batmobile to go with his rubber suit.) His nanny Hobson is played by Helen Mirren in a gender flip from John Gielguds classic performance as the acid-tongued butler of the original. Mirren is fine though not enough of a fuddy-duddy to shock you with her impertinence the way Gielgud did. Brand has a handful of funny moments like when hes sitting at an auction and bids ""20000 of money"" or is accused of acting like an idiot and blurts out the ingeniously blitzed self-defense ""I dont consider it to be idiocy but a savantish gift for defying death with fun"" Brand hasnt lost his garrulous talent for spinning out a line like that one. It turns out though that his singsong Cockney flippancy which can be such a tonic in small doses becomes toxic when its the whole show. The reason? He doesnt connect with anyone on screen. Not Mirren. Not Jennifer Garner as the all-surface corporate heiress whom Arthurs mother (Geraldine James) is forcing him to marry lest he be cut off from his trust fund. And not Greta Gerwig as Naomi the slightly kooky free spirit who can save him. Naomi whos from Queens gives unlicensed tours of Grand Central station and represents everything thats ""real."" To punch up the point Gerwig who came up in mumblecore movies like Hannah Takes the Stairs (and was the costar of Ben Stillers Greenberg) wears her crunchy sincerity on her sweetly open apple-cheeked face. She has an earth-angel adorability. But when Arthur takes Naomi to Grand Central for a midnight date accompanied by a generic cover of ""Arthurs Theme (Best That You Can Do)"" the scene has all the romantic magic of an infomercial. Arthur of course is supposed to be selfish but Dudley Moore in the 1981 version showed you the twinkle of innocence that Arthurs drunkenness covered up. Even sloshed he kept surprising himself. Moore was a happy rascal. Brand is more like a reptile who plays at being innocent. His Arthur goes to AA (an all-too-?inevitable joke) but it almost doesnt matter if hes drunk or not since Russell Brand always seems to be drunk?on his one-note joy-buzzer brain. If he really wants to be a star he may need the actors version of an intervention something to stand between his talent and what looks like his relentless self-love.

The film apparently takes place in the present day (cue recession reference) although no one seems to have heard of those common contemporary safety nets for the idle rich the Internet or reality TV. Still supposedly a debauchee Brands Arthur cruises Manhattan in too-tight schoolboy suits and fawns over Naomi (Greta Gerwig) a wide-eyed tour guide who wears rompers and longs to write books for kids while John Gielgud and Geraldine Fitzgeralds parental surrogates have been conflated into a single nanny (Helen Mirren) still hanging around the thirtysomething Arthurs nursery. Where Moores Arthur found his establishment-defying soulmate in wacky poor girl Liza Minnelli the new film attempts to romanticize Arthur and Naomis shared childlike naivete and chaste affection; the billionaires business-minded arranged bride on the other hand is sexually aggressive to the point of debasing the actress who plays her (Jennifer Garner). Maybe the 1981 film isnt exactly a sacred cow but from the temperance subplot that replaces the originals unrepentant celebration of Arthurs obliteration to the shitty up-tempo cover of Christopher Crosss karaoke classic ""Arthurs Theme"" this remake seems to exist only to zap the original of its minor pleasures.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download Arthur Review 1057 PM PDT 4/4/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Warner Bros. A muddle-headed remake of a classic screen comedy. TWITTER Russell Brand Helen Mirren and Jennifer Garner star in Jason Winers film about a lovable drunken billionaire playboy. Its still an open question whether in this day of increased concerns about alcoholism and health you can do a remake of 1981s Arthur a comedy about a lovable drunk because the new Arthur with Russell Brand playing the Dudley Moore role is a mere burlesque riffing off the old Arthur rather than an actual remake that has reconceived or rethought the original film. The story hasnt changed much nor have the characters. But the comedy is now crude instead of whimsical and its characters overblown caricatures instead of screwball personalities. A movie has been reduced to a sketch. Ones enjoyment of Arthur-- and its box office chances -- may depend on a new audience having little if any knowledge of the earlier work. As a Russell Brand Show fans and followers may enjoy his extravagant mugging and nuttiness. Those with any memory of 1981s Arthurwill be severely disappointed. That movie -- lets call it OldArthur -- came out of nowhere. TV veteran Steve Gordon created an ineffable charming comedy that defied movie traditions even of that time. Comic intoxication was usually reserved for the Animal House kind of comedies and rich guys were seldom heroes. Gordon insisted that his incredibly rich anddrunk protagonist was a gentle soul looking for love but willing to accept a night of fun if that didnt pan out. Moore a British import who had just hit it big as a leading man in Blake Edwards 10 gave Arthur a sweetness to go along with his prankster personality. It was a knowing performance full of wit and grace and savvy observation. Brand shares a British heritage with Moore but his comedy is much different. The guy is a talent no doubt. Only last week he put an undeniable comic jolt into Universals animation/live-action mix Hop. But there is edginess to Brands humor even an aggressiveness. His Arthur creates scenes not laughs. Hes a pathetic bratty little boy who refuses to grow up rather than a genial alcoholic who wouldnt harm a fly. Peter Baynhams new script has done even more damage to the key relationship in Arthurs life. Perhaps the filmmakers thought it was very clever to turn Hobson (John Gielgud) Arthurs fatherly butler into a nanny played by Helen Mirren. It certainly does further emphasize Arthurs infantilism. But unlike Gielguds character Mirrens Hobson is in constant conflict with her aging charge. She prods sharply where the butler steered with the gentlest of touches. Old Arthurs butler was subtle and unflappable while Mirrens nanny has a bit of Mary Poppins in her. The story again revolves around a billionaire parent (Geraldine James) demanding Arthur grow up enough to enter into a loveless marriage to a rich WASP (Jennifer Garner) mostly for business purposes or hell be disinherited. (Here again the New Arthurinsists on a gender change from a male to female parent.) At the same time Arthur meets the love of his life in unlicensed Grand Central Station tour guide Naomi (indie film stalwart Greta Gerwig). So both Arthurspresent a thoroughly conventional romantic-comedy about love vs. money with a predicable outcome. This humdrum story line therefore allows or at least it should a completely unpredictable and outlandish character to take over. Neophyte feature director Jason Winer turns things over to Brand all right but its a rough out-of-focus performance. Not helping matters the movie relies on its props far too much -- from an incongruous Batmobile borrowed from a fellow Warner Bros. movie to a magnetic floating bed. These tend of underscore showiness over comedy brashness over subtlety. Perhaps encouraged by his props and toys Brand goes full bore in every scene almost as if the movie isnt so much about a drunk as an eccentric billionaire who would be loopy if he drank only lemonade. In fact no one working on New Arthurseems completely comfortable with this protagonist. So you get AA meetings and lines tsk-tsking over ""free spending during a recession."" The movie keeps throwing up PC signs along the way to demonstrate how shocked everyone is to borrow from Casablanca that gambling is taking place in a casino. Guys your character was always going to be a profligate drunk if you remake Arthur so get over it. And Hobsons admonition to Arthur to scrub his private parts to prevent disease following unprotected sex just blows your mind. This is the advice of his sagacious nanny? When tragedy overtakes Arthur as Hobson falls fatally ill the film becomes cloying rather than touching. Theres no heart in any of this as the tenacious bond between the man-child and his governess has never been convincingly established. In Old Arthur all supporting players had great moments; in New Arthur everyone hits his marks and thats about it. The spontaneity and gentle whimsy is missing. And so is the luxurious wit of Gordons original screenplay. Baynhams script prods along without memorable lines or scenes even when it imitates Old Arthuras closely as it can. In the end it isnt so much that the New Arthurisnt the Old Arthur. Rather its the anti-Arthur. Opens April 8 (Warner Bros.) Warner Bros.
