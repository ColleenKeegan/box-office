""We belong to a generation that watched our dream get stolen from under us. Used to be that if you got good grades you got a good job. . ."" Its a pat bit of righteous indignation--part Fight Club part a million other pseudo-rebellious big-budget Hollywood films whose insights and social commentary are easily dismantled. (Exactly who was once ""guaranteed"" a good job as a reward for scholastic achievement?) Director Robert Luketic working from a screenplay by Barry L. Levy and Jason Dean Hall (adapted from Joseph Finders novel) rallies hard to get audiences to identify with Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) an entitled unlikable peon at a high-tech company. Adam longs for money and power to escape his wrong-side-of-the-tracks origins. After he blows a pitch meeting before Nicolas Wyatt his companys powerful CEO (Gary Oldman in extra-crispy villain mode) Adam is fired and retaliates by running up his company credit card before its cut off. Wyatt forces him to work off his debt by infiltrating the powerful tech firm of Wyatts archenemy to steal plans for a game-changing new phone. Adam secures his new job with laughably unlikely ease and then unwittingly plays his role as dupe for two powerful men. Were supposed to cheer as he swims with sharks but this is a film at odds with itself wanting to be a 99 percenter rallying cry but wallowing in and fetishizing 1 percenter accoutrement at every turn. And though we are living in a fear of a National Security Agency planet the film squanders the opportunity to say anything about navigating a hyper-surveilled life that James Bond (or Jason Bourne) films havent already said much better.Film Details Paranoia RatingPG-13 GenreDrama Running Time106 More Info Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Ernest Hardy Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Harrison Ford collects a paycheck and Liam Hemsworth models a superb wardrobe in ""Paranoia."" Photo Relativity Media Paranoia review A preposterous thriller 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Paranoia Thriller. Directed by Robert Luketic. With Liam Hemsworth Gary Oldman Harrison Ford. PG-13. 106 minutes. ""Paranoia"" a ho-hum thriller about corporate spying in the high-tech world comes off as a lot more preposterous than paranoid and it takes no more than a few frames for the eye rolling to commence. First we meet our main character Adam Cassidy a ""regular"" geek who looks like a Christian Dior model. Liam Hemsworth (""Hunger Games"") makes for a convincing babe magnet - and the camera loves him - but a trailblazing computer whiz? A tortured soul? What were they thinking? Well when you see him in various stages of undress you know exactly what they were thinking. That this guy could outsmart the worlds biggest baddest corporate tycoons is only the first in a long list of implausibilities that verge dangerously close to camp. This situation could have been mitigated if the exercise exuded any sense of excitement and suspense but just about everything here is halfhearted. The flaccid proceedings begin in un-earnest when Adam gets axed from the Wyatt Corp. after trading barbs with CEO Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman collecting a paycheck). In response Adam stages one last work party courtesy of the company credit card. That doesnt sit well with Mr. Wyatt who gives Adam the choice of prison time or a well-paid gig spying on Wyatts hated rival Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford collecting a paycheck). Before you know it out-of-work Adam has a multistory New York pad that would make Donald Trump blush - all he has to do is pilfer the secrets to Goddards new gadget. And of course flaunt his superb wardrobe which presumably gets him hired on at the rival firm. For the next hour or so there are some double crosses hints of murder FBI intrigue - most of which fall flat and go nowhere. The exquisitely photographed exteriors of New York coupled with Junkie XLs entrancing score provide more thrills than any of the story elements. Much of the problem is the casting of Hemsworth who doesnt have the screen presence to hold up this film (hes in almost every scene). To cut the guy some slack the lackluster script doesnt give him a character to play; instead his emotional arc is announced in a series of voice-overs that seem to be tacked on to the beginning and end of the picture. We also never remotely believe his relationship with Emma played by Amber Heard a decent actress who deserves a better fate than portraying her nincompoop character (there are lots of inexplicably dumb computer types in his movie). You halfway expect her to Snapchat herself and send it to 911 in hopes of being rescued by someone. Anyone. Faring better is Adams best friend Kevin played by Lucas Till with a sincere nerdish charm and Wyatts right hand Judith played with devilish flair by Embeth Davidtz who gives the movie much-needed life every time shes onscreen. ""Paranoia"" represents another disappointing outing for director Robert Luketic whose inspired debut ""Legally Blonde"" has been followed by a slate of so-so films. This latest project fits perfectly into that forgettable file. David Lewis is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 16 2013 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 16 2013 1146AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Robert Luketic Written by Jason Dean Hall and Barry Levy Starring Liam Hemsworth Harrison Ford Gary Oldman Classification PG Genre thriller Country USA Language English Corporate thrillers just arent what they used to be. In the genres heyday movies such as Wall Street and The Firm were really wish-fulfillment fantasies barely disguised as morality tales. Their post-2008-crash descendants such as Margin Call are more akin to disaster movies.Which brings us to the peculiar Paranoia. Based on a nine-year-old thriller by Joseph Finder this is an analogue thriller pitched to a fluid digital generation. Liam Hemsworth the handsome star from The Hunger Games plays a young tech whiz Adam Cassidy who gets blackmailed into corporate espionage while trying to support his emphysema-suffering dad (Richard Dreyfuss). Hemsworth has little of that brash edge that Charlie Sheen and Tom Cruise brought to their roles a few decades ago. He does take his shirt off a lot though; then again in this emptily handsome movie even the FBI agents and thugs look like Abercrombie amp; Fitch models. Multimedia Paranoia The official trailer The biggest problem is that Paranoia is a thriller for the wrong kind of business. Instead of the laid-back open-concept spaces of West Coast start-ups we are placed in the rigid hierarchy of the New York financial sector with high-rises corner offices tailored suits and oak-panelled private clubs in businesses run by old guys.The two big-shot tech rivals are played by Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman though there is something to be said for poetic licence. Oldman as Nicolas Wyatt is a tart-tongued Cockney tough in a suit who acts as though his favourite contemporary technology would be a switchblade. Wyatt blackmails Adam into infiltrating a rival company Eikon run by Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford). Adam is carefully groomed for the task by Wyatts icy henchwoman played by Embeth Davidtz (""I have a PhD in behavioural psychology"") who dresses him up in nice clothes and provides him with a gorgeous condo and hot car.Theres a minor hitch when Adam discovers that Eikons head of marketing is Emma Jennings (the largely wasted Amber Heard) a recent awkward one-night stand. But soon hes swilling champagne in the Hamptons with his new boss Jock Goddard. As played by Ford Goddard looks somewhat plausible with a shaved head glasses and casual clothes that evoke the late Apple chief Steve Jobs.More importantly Ford has some real fun in a silly role pirougeas a shrewd old puppet master who wants to whip these young upstarts. Theres a scene in a members-only club where Wyatt and Goddard meet giving the two veteran actors the chance to go eyeball to eyeball for a couple of minutes of barbed dialogue. It almost makes the movie worth it. Report Typo/Error Follow Liam Lacey on Twitter liamlacey More Related to this Story In a World...

Harrison Ford plays Oldmans archenemy and former mentor whos all too eager to adopt the kid as his new protege. Director Robert Luketic (The Ugly Truth Killers) misses a bet by reducing the topic of electronic surveillance to a mere plot device and his casting is unintentionally ironic in a movie about a new generations hunger to topple the old guard pretty boy Hemsworth is outclassed by his veteran costars who get more mileage from baring their teeth than he does baring his chest.

"Paranoia | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paranoia ) Paranoia (United States 2013) August 17 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Ive seen movies like this more often than Id like to admit glitzy thrillers with less intelligence than a smart rutabaga where big-name actors pick up a paycheck while trying with limited success not to embarrass themselves and the studio keeps it hidden from critics. Yes Paranoia is one of those. Its the kind of film you go into hoping for a guilty pleasure - after all its got Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford. They played effectively against one another in Air Force One right? (Yes but that was directed by Wolfgang Petersen.) How bad could it be? However once you realize theres no ""pleasure"" to be had from something this wantonly dumb and idiotically constructed all thats left is ""guilt"" - guilt that you actually spent money to see this. Caveat emptor. Assessing responsibility for the films failure is difficult. Maybe the fault lies in Joseph Finders source material. (I havent read the book.) Or maybe it has something to do with the screenplay adaptation. Barry L. Levy previously wrote Vantage Point which was okay; Jason Hall wrote Spread which wasnt. Or maybe its Robert Luketics fault; its questionable why producers would bring in the director of fluffy romantic stuff like Legally Blonde and The Ugly Truth to make a high-tech thriller. Regardless the end result is that the movie doesnt make a whole lot of sense and when it does it would be better off not doing so. Theres no understanding of corporate security or how things work in the telecom industry. And theres a trickle-down effect to this stupidity it infects everything including how the characters act and interact. Neither Liam Hemsworth who plays protagonist Adam Cassidy nor Amber Heard who has the thankless role of his love interest Emma Jennings is effective and their on-screen chemistry could best be described as limited. The most interesting exchange between them occurs when they toss techie terms at one another over lunch. Foreplay for geeks. Oldman and Ford fall back on comfortable acting patterns the former chews scenery and the latter resorts to a low-key approach that results in him fading into the background. As Adams dad Richard Dreyfuss spends a third of his screen time in an easy chair a third in a hospital bed a third on the stoop and all the time making us feel terribly sad that a once-respected actor has come to this. The story goes something like this Ambitious hotshot Adam Cassidy works at Wyattcorp a cutthroat cell phone manufacturer. After a failed presentation in front of the corporations CEO Nicholas Wyatt (Oldman) he finds himself unemployed. But Wyatt decides to give Adam a second chance. The mission is to infiltrate the inner circle of rival company Eikon run by Wyatts former mentor Jock Goddard (Ford) and steal the plans for a super-secret new gadget. To help Wyatt supplies him with an exclusive apartment an impressive resume and lessons about how to ""fit in"" administered by psychiatrist Judith Bolton (Embeth Davidtz). Shes Henry Higgins to Adams Eliza Dolittle. The stage is set for espionage but Adams infatuation for Eikons marketing manager Emma Jennings and his affinity for Jock - not to mention a growing distrust of Wyatt - make it difficult for him to continue with his assignment. This doesnt sit well with Wyatt who dispatches a henchman (Julian McMahon) to convince Adam that reneging on their deal is not in his best interests. Paranoias feeble straightforward conclusion is a disappointment on many levels not the least of which is that it offers little in the way of surprises or twists. Okay maybe there is a twist but its so obvious that it doesnt count as one. The resolution is unimaginative and unbelievable. It amazes me how in the movie world supposedly brilliant and ruthless men are undone by such simple things. In a smarter movie Adam would get eaten alive and spit out by people like Wyatt and Goddard. Emma wouldnt fall for his superficial charm. And wed have a potentially interesting tale. But thats not what Luketic gives us. Instead were stuck with a film thats released in mid-August with no advance screenings. That more than anything is descriptive of what Paranoia represents.

A wanna-be tech hotshot (Liam Hemsworth) seduced by fame and fortune is roped into an espionage battle between rival corporate Goliaths (Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford). The disillusionment that follows his Faustian bargain comes quickly though not before the hunk can successfully woo a beauty (Amber Heard) while exuding more repugnant smugness than a dozen like-minded social climbers. While the atmosphere should be sexy and sinister director Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde) makes every action scene look as dreary as possible and even the reunion of the two Air Force One veterans results in pedestrian showdowns instead of clash-of-the-titans grandeur. The fact that Hemsworth is severely lacking in leading-man charisma also doesnt help the pervasive overall incompetence of the film which fixates on the perils and panic of our modern surveillance culture while itself proving to be borderline unwatchable.

Special to Newsday + - From left Harrison Ford and Liam Hemsworth star in Relativity Medias ""Paranoia"" directed by Robert Luketic. Photo Credit Paranoia Productions advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Young engineer is coerced into industrial espionage. Rated PG-13 BOTTOM LINE Youre not paranoid -- it really is bad. CAST Liam Hemsworth Gary Oldman Amber Heard Harrison Ford LENGTH 146 From its generic title to its preposterous plot this techno-non-thriller wants to make a statement about the illusion of privacy in a world of location-tracking smartphones data mining and blanketing surveillance cameras. And then it has a young tech executive marvel at how someone knew she went to Yale. Um your own Facebook page? ""Paranoia"" sees itself as a generational successor to Francis Ford Coppolas 1974 classic ""The Conversation"" (coincidentally also featuring Harrison Ford in a supporting role) and its 1998 sequel-in-spirit ""Enemy of the State."" Yet filmmaker Robert Luketic who directed ""Legally Blonde"" and went on to bad Katherine Heigl rom-coms (""The Ugly Truth"" ""Killers"") and a bad thriller (""21"") here proves equally sludgy in romance and thrills. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Miscast heartthrob Liam Hemsworth stars as electronics engineer Adam Cassidy a cubicle drone at a tech giant owned by Nicolas Wyatt (Gary Oldman). Wyatt catches the just-fired Cassidy in the movies first unbelievable plot turn -- racking up a 16000 bar bill on a company credit card that this worldwide technology conglomerate somehow neglected to take back or cancel. Threatened with prison Cassidy agrees to infiltrate Eikon a company run by rival CEO Jock Goddard (Ford) to steal a game-changing smartphone prototype. When step one of The Big Plan is having Eikon immediately hire Cassidy you know the plot has more holes than a golf course. Why does Meachum (Julian McMahon) Wyatts brutal yet completely ineffective enforcer have his own name appear when phoning the undercover Cassidy at Goddards mansion? Why does a domino-effect incident hinge on Cassidys senior-citizen dad (Richard Dreyfuss) not being on Cassidys health insurance? Hed be on Medicare so whats the problem? All these and other questions are accompanied by technobabble that would make a Trekkers head spin and voice-over narration that sounds like a parody of voice-over narration. And while the film contrives to show Hemsworth shirtless three times in the first half-hour its hard to imagine that either this or a romantic subplot with Eikons marketing chief (Amber Heard) will bring a teen-girl audience to this film. 234 MoviesParanoia trailer PLOT Young engineer is coerced into industrial espionage. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 CAST Liam Hemsworth Gary Oldman Amber Heard Harrison Ford LENGTH 146 BOTTOM LINE Youre not paranoid -- it really is bad.

More like Ennui REVIEW While a mindless corporate thriller is an oxymoron ""Paranoia"" is too sloppy and slack to inspire tension.  |  out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune August 15 2013 -- 313pm Relativity Media Liam Hemsworth in ""Paranoia."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Theres a long tradition of dumb action movies and no-brainer comedies but a mindless corporate thriller is an oxymoron. The form only works when characters plot and counterplot with the finesse of chess masters and the consequence of one ploy leads with clockwork inevitability to the next. ""Paranoia"" is too sloppy and slack to inspire tension. Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman play tech-king adversaries with Liam Hemsworth as the low-level employee working both sides. The film is pretty enough to look at -- its like an ominous Pottery Barn catalog -- and Hemsworth delivers on the level of eye candy what he lacks in dramatic skill. His character is a striver from Brooklyn with an ailing salt-of-the-earth dad (Richard Dreyfuss) who delivers nuggets of moral guidance as mechanically as a gumball machine. Oldman the snarly CEO of the smartphone company that employs Hemsworth as an apps developer gets his hooks into the kid promising him the moon if he infiltrates Fords rival firm to steal a Plot Device. The story takes an odd swerve as Oldman sends Hemsworth to a weekend finishing school to buff away his rough edges and make him the very model of a rising star executive. Hes decked out in a GQ wardrobe and set up in a magnificent loft the sort of glam wish-fulfillment fantasy that usually occurs in womens pictures. The Pygmalion makeover merely slows an already interminable time-waster. Director Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"") isnt in synch with his material. ""Paranoia"" derives from themes of omnipresent surveillance but it has little connection to real-world anxieties about eroding privacy. Its not a great exercise in razzle-dazzle style either Here corporate henchmen inevitably carpool in big black conspicuous Escalades. The suspense scenes dont have any rhythmic flow or logic. You wonder why Hemsworth is toiling away as a corporate cog. His supernatural ability to figure out secret pass codes in seconds would get him a corner office at the NSA. Much of the film involves smartphone skullduggery and the temptation is to say that the cast phoned in their performances. They didnt. They texted. Oldman lays on the loathsomeness but doesnt supply the mocking flourishes that make his villains distinctive. Fords avuncular act as his arch rival is so transparent that any alert viewer will anticipate a switcheroo. Theres no payoff when the masks come off. ""Paranoia"" has no new tricks up its sleeves. It doesnt even have sleeves. PARANOIA  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for some sexuality violence and language. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

More like deja vu. Director Robert Luketics rehash of every techno-thriller from the past 20 years stars Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games) as Adam Cassidy a cocky New York computer whiz who gets used as a pawn by two warring CEOs obsessed with corporate espionage. Hemsworths Adam is meant to be a brainy and ambitious Everyman but with his impossibly sculpted Abercrombie physique and knack for removing his shirt at the merest suggestion its hard to buy him staying up all night writing code. This cyberdud kicks off when Adam gets the opportunity to pitch his billionaire boss Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman) on a new software program and gets shot down in flames. He and his team are pink-slipped. To help soothe the sting Adam and his herd of hipster nerds decide to party all night on his boss dime running up a 16000 tab on table-service vodka. The next day Wyatt summons Adam to his office and proposes a Faustian bargain (one that sounds especially sinister when delivered in Oldmans Cockney accent) Wyatt wont press charges if Adam agrees to become a mole in his rivals company Eikon. To sweeten the deal promises of wealth sports cars and Dr. Evil-like glass-and-steel lairs are thrown into the mix. Jason Hall and Barry L. Levys Swiss-cheese script which was officially adapted from Joseph Finders bestselling novel (and unofficially from The Firm) makes it impossibly easy for Adam to infiltrate Eikon the competing tech giant run by Harrison Fords charismatic chrome-domed honcho Jock Goddard. Adam quickly impresses both his new boss and Eikons sultry head of marketing (Amber Heard) which leads to even more opportunities for close-ups of Hemsworths hard-working abs in the boudoir. Since the movie is called Paranoia and both Oldman and Ford are quickly telegraphed as mustache-twirling baddies of the first order you know that plenty of conspiracy twists lay in store. I wont give them away here but I will warn you not to get your hopes up. As Adams sickly blue-collar father Richard Dreyfus has a few good scenes playing what is essentially the Martin Sheen role from Wall Street and Embeth Davidtz is memorably icy as Oldmans henchwoman with her severe bob and clipped British diction. But the only real reason Paranoia is even remotely worth watching is the chance to see Oldman and Ford go head-to-head like two vipers thrown into a potato sack. These two veterans have been so good for so long that even in a movie as lightweight and disposable as this one they cant help but be entertaining.

Director Robert Luketics thriller ""Paranoia"" has a host of problems but the biggest seems to be that no one in it is nearly paranoid enough. This is a film in which titans of industry discuss nefarious world takeover schemes with the discretion of Bond villains tech whizzes work on top-secret military projects in the middle of dive bars and corporate henchmen chase targets through crowded restaurants with guns drawn to deliver messages most people would send via text. Indifferently made and nearly tension-free this Liam Hemsworth starrer should generate moderate opening weekend B.O.; after that it would be well advised to look over its shoulder.This story first appeared in the August 13 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Inhabiting a strange simulacrum of modern-day New York where Brooklyn is still unfashionable Silicon Valley companies are headquartered in Lower Manhattan and nightclub doormen profess a ""no hipsters"" entrance policy Hemsworths oft-shirtless protagonist Adam Cassidy is an entry-level programmer at a multinational tech company supporting his sick live-in father (Richard Dreyfuss) out in the boroughs. Given the chance to make a product proposal for the companys oleaginous CEO Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman) Adam whiffs his pitch and his subsequent mouthing off to the board gets him and his whole team fired. Unruffled by the setback Adam convinces his fellow pink-slippees to go out drinking with their curiously uncanceled corporate credit cards and the gang goes to town with Ciroq bottle service in a trendy club. Deciding that a frattish disgruntled former employee with a taste for Diddys signature vodka is precisely the person in whom to entrust an illegal corporate espionage project Wyatt recalls Adam to the company the next morning enlisting him to spy on rival tech giant Eikon (pronounced ""Icahn"") run by Wyatts former mentor the Steve Jobs-like Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford). Quickly rising through the Eikon ranks Adam is teamed with the companys marketing head Emma (Amber Heard) a driven Ivy Leaguer determined to succeed in a mans world -- thats literally how shes introduced at parties -- with whom Adam previously enjoyed a one-night stand. As Adam works his way deeper into Goddards inner-circle and Emmas bedroom he navigates a few mild double-crosses (every single one of them telegraphed by the films trailer) and begins to wonder if his very personal safety might be in jeopardy -- his first clue coming around the 45-minute mark when an FBI agent shows him autopsy photos of three recent Wyatt-commissioned corporate spies who like Spinal Tap drummers all seemed to perish in mysterious circumstances. Romantic-comedy veteran Luketic working from a script adapted from Joseph Finders novel clearly has no illusions that hes making ""The Conversation"" (or even ""Duplicity"") and theres nothing wrong with tuning ones brain down to a lower frequency for a fun old-fashioned thriller. Yet even the most by-the-numbers suspense tropes somehow slip through this films fingers. A particularly boilerplate scene in which Adam attempts to download intel from Emmas computer while shes in the shower frantically cuts between the slowly creeping download bar Adams darting eyes and Emma gradually emerging from the bathroom ... only to abruptly cut to the two peacefully back in bed with no explanation. As bad as the attempts at tension may fare ""Paranoia"" is even worse when it attempts to smarten up. An early sequence in which Wyatts corporate fixer (Embeth Davidtz) is tasked with instructing Adam on the shadow-play rituals of executive culture seems ripe for satire yet even after his big Pygmalion makeover Adams grasp on corporate lingo still amounts to lines like ""They made me an offer ... a big-ass offer"" Hemsworth and Heard are both extremely beautiful and would be ideal models for Abercrombie amp; Fitchs business casual collection yet neither suggests more than a glimmer of personality beneath their chiseled exteriors here. As for the overqualified veterans on call Ford looks tired Dreyfuss is sprightly and Oldman seems content to amuse himself with an accent modeled on the Geiko gecko. At least bit players Lucas Till and Angela Sarafyan manage to sneak in some likable moments playing Shaggy and Velma to Hemsworths Fred. The films technical attributes are all suitably professional though Luketic betrays a weakness for gimmicky time-lapse fast-forward and stuttered-frame footage that makes little contextual sense. A mostly electronic score from Junkie XL is occasionally quite irritating using cell-phone chirrups as recurring motifs and cuing up doom-laden swells to accompany Hemsworth doing nothing more exciting than opening the curtains.

Videomakerfx Review says June 9 2015 at 706 am Can I just say what a comfort to discover someone who genuinely knows what they are discussing over the internet. You definitely realize how to bring a problem to light and make it important. More people ought to look at this and understand this side of the story. I was surprised that you are not more popular since you definitely have the gift. Reply Frederick Louis Richardson says August 10 2013 at 341 pm Sounds as if Liam Hemsworth was better served in THE EXPENDABLES 2 under a more veteran director. Actors -- particularly young up-and-coming (think early Tom Cruise) -- have more potential than their nascent performance may indicate entitling them to a director with a bit more experience than they have. Reply G. Jardoness says August 9 2013 at 424 pm Sounds like a cross between ""Limitless"" ""Eagle Eye"" and ""Bonfire of the Vanities""? -- You have my sympathies.

Daily Edition Login to download Paranoia Film Review 1100 AM PDT 8/9/2013 by Stephen Farber FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Slick but muddled thriller about corporate espionage never gets our pulse pounding. TWITTER ""Hunger Games"" co-star Liam Hemsworth butts heads with tycoons Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford in this thriller set in the executive suites of the tech industry. Thrillers about corporate intrigue run the risk of seeming rarefied and convoluted rather than suspenseful. That was the undoing of the high-profile Julia Roberts-Clive Owen starrer Duplicity a few years ago and Paranoia might well suffer the same fate. The story of an ambitious young techie recruited to spy on his bosss archrival never really generates the life-and-death tension that would keep audiences involved. Despite glossy production values the film seems unlikely to stir major box-office sparks. Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) and a group of young pals are disappointed when their presentation of a new gizmo fails to impress their ruthless boss Nic Wyatt (Gary Oldman). After they are fired Adam decides to have one last fling at Wyatts expense and takes his friends on a binge using his corporate credit card. Wyatt demands restitution but he suggests that Adam can make amends by going to work for a fellow tycoon and stealing his secrets. Adam reluctantly agrees to the plan and joins the inner circle of Eikon Corp. run by Wyatts former partner Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford with a shaved head that makes him resemble Amazon founder Jeffrey Bezos). Adam soon finds himself caught in the middle of a lifelong feud between the two tycoons and he begins to feel his life is in danger. Things get even more complicated when the FBI comes calling and tries to enlist Adam to help with its investigation of the corporate giants shady business practices. PHOTOS The Hunger Games Catching Fire Cast Heats Up Cannes The script by Jason Hall and Barry L. Levy based on a novel by Joseph Finder starts off with a lot of credibility problems. Adam lands a top position at Goddards company with remarkable ease considering that his track record has been less than stellar. His rise is so swift that it isnt hard to guess that Goddard has ulterior motives of his own. Of course Adam is being used by both billionaires so there isnt much narrative surprise. Its clear that everyone is duplicitous but it isnt always clear how their plotting proceeds with so few glitches. The writers try to heighten the stakes when one of Adams friends is run over in traffic but the film never develops a true sense of jeopardy. It also doesnt help that there really isnt anyone to root for in this game of cat-and-mouse. The easily manipulated fiercely ambitious Adam isnt the most likable protagonist and a few shots of him placing a blanket over his ailing father (Richard Dreyfuss) are all-too-blatant attempts to win sympathy for a fairly soulless social climber. Both Stoddard and Wyatt are coldhearted sharks and Adams love interest a snooty Ivy League-educated executive (Amber Heard) isnt endearing either. Hemsworths performance isnt strong enough to put us on his side. The Hunger Games co-star certainly cuts a dashing figure and his frequent shirtless scenes will please his fans but he never fully engages our sympathy. Oldman and Ford do relish their turns at corporate villainy and Embeth Davidtz as Oldmans steely associate brings considerable flair to her role. PHOTOS Senior Superheroes 19 Action Stars Kicking Butt Past 50 Director Robert Luketic hasnt been able to sustain the promise he showed in his two early movies Legally Blonde and 21. His recent movies increasingly have grown bland and formulaic. Technical credits however are strong. The sleek environs of corporate offices and billionaire mansions are well caught by cinematographer David Tattersall and production designers David Brisbin and Missy Stewart. But the intrigue in high places never really has us on the edge of our seats and the formulaic happy ending -- fortified by some desperate voice-over narration provided to fill the holes in the plot -- undermines the entire exercise. The filmmakers may have hoped to make a timely commentary on the amorality in our executive suites but they end up merely restating the obvious. Maybe the whole thing would have played better as a corporate comedy the kind that Doris Day and Rock Hudson made some 50 years ago.

He plays Adam Cassidy a Brooklyn-born bridge-and-tunnel type futilely working his way up the ranks at WyattCorp in Manhattan. After a crash-and-burn pitch meeting with company president Nicolas Wyatt (Gary Oldman) sees him and his team fired and after a night on the town at the companys expense sees him caught Adam is blackmailed by Wyatt into working for the enemy Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford) at rival tech giant Eikon. Adam has an ailing father (Richard Dreyfuss) to consider not to mention an FBI agent (Josh Holloway) keen on pointing out that every other lackey whos been put in a similar position by WyattCorp has wound up dead. Whats a hunkier Hayden Christensen to do? At his best fellow Aussie import Robert Luketic directs amiable but ultimately forgettable films (""21"" ""Legally Blonde""); at his worst he makes Katherine Heigl vehicles (""Killers"" ""The Ugly Truth""). His first out-and-out thriller ""Paranoia"" sees Luketic working primarily in grays and blues to convey the chilly corporate world in which Adam finds himself ensnared. The oddly striking shot slips in there whether its the silently ominous reveal of a completely re-furnished apartment the day after Adams torn it asunder or the disjointed reflection of nearing security guards across floor tiles. Less convincing though are the slow-motion interludes and glitchy interference meant to sell us on our heros titular state of mind or the laughably red ""security lighting"" intended to serve as a panicky mid-heist contrast to the films otherwise cool demeanor while blocking out five floors in the middle of a skyscraper for all around to see. The baddies similarly cherish menace over logic with Ford and Oldmans first reunion since 1997s ""Air Force One"" a moderately hammy highlight while WyattCorp associates Embeth Davidtz and Julian McMahon ooze sinister intentions from the sidelines. Amber Heard gets thankless love-interest duties just as Lucas Till gets to be the requisite scorned best friend. That leaves Hemsworth whose leading man roles in ""The Last Song"" and ""Love amp; Honor"" suggested a charisma that alleviate either films corny trappings. Sadly that charm is hardly evident here; Hemsworth is rarely bad but so thoroughly bland that theres little reason to have stake in Adams fate as if it were ever in any doubt. Frankly no one in this ensemble is done any favors by Jason Hall and Barry Levys screenplay a ""Duplicity"" for dummies filled to the brim with double-crossing cliches and clunkers like ""Power is the juice. Get used to drinking it."" and ""Dont try to revise death"" Theres much sprinting and keyboard-clacking for an audience that might feasibly value the sight of either over the presence of genuine invention or suspense. At one point Wyatt takes Adam aside and shares a quote from Picasso ""A good artist copies. A great artist steals."" Rest assured that no great artists were involved with the making of this film.

CEO Wyatt (Gary Oldman center) greets Adam (Liam Hemsworth) and Goddard (Harrison Ford) in ""Paranoia."" ( ) You realize fairly early on that ""Paranoia"" is going to be the kind of movie where resourceful youth beats corrupt age frosty corporate uber-vixens warm up after a single pleasant conversation and actors try gamely to keep a straight face while saying ""You lied to me"" and ""It was all a setup"" Why blaze new trails when the old ones are so well-marked? This one is essentially ""The Firm"" with smartphones. At least its unpretentious airplane-movie fare and thats a quality that can be hard to come by when Hollywood starts getting all lecture-y about those evil corporations out there doing . . . whatever they do. Hollywood doesnt know because the only industry that fascinates it is its own. Liam Hemsworth -- thats the boy-band-y ""Hunger Games"" one not the pro-wrestler-ish Chris Hemsworth of ""Thor"" -- plays a young tech striver with the requisite working-class background a la Charlie Sheen in ""Wall Street."" His honest proletarian Brooklyn father (Richard Dreyfuss) is dying of emphysema while sneaking stogies but somehow his decaying health is all the fault of heartless corporations. (OK the movie is a little lefty-pretentious but only in the most endearing way like an undergraduate whos just discovered Howard Zinn.) Adam (Hemsworth) is simultaneously a genius and a failure who has been occupying the same cubicle without a raise for six years which you would think would indicate hes in the wrong line of work. Yet after getting fired and enjoying a binge on the company plastic he is tapped by the companys nasty CEO Nicolas Wyatt (an amusing Gary Oldman working a Cockney accent) to do a little corporate espionage mission. Wyatt -- who runs his Manhattan headquarters with subatomic-level scrutiny yet somehow forgot to cancel the expense account of a guy he just fired -- blackmails the kid into stealing a hot new smartphone from his corporate nemesis and former mentor Jock Goddard (a snarly bald Harrison Ford). The rival firms marketing chief (Amber Heard) is a girl Adam once bonked in a drunken haze. Much of the movie by director Robert Luketic (""21"") is so cheerfully dumb with Adam using entry-level Jedi mind tricks to win the confidence of Jock (""You lost your son? I lost my mom Lets bond"") that there has to be more to it than that. And so there is though the couple of good twists are saved up for the end by which time you may be checking out the duty-free offerings in SkyMall. Until then theres enough to keep you mildly occupied without paying much attention Its a brain teaser for those who would prefer not to have to think too much.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com PARANOIA Share Comment ""Paranoia"" is a plug-and-play Hollywood thriller not the best the genre has to offer but hardly the worst. The formula Take a handsome up-and-coming male lead (Liam Hemsworth Gale in ""The Hunger Games"" franchise) surround him with aging stars in juicy character roles (Harrison Ford Gary Oldman) and send them all chasing after a high-tech MacGuffin that ultimately means nothing to the plot. Fold in a dewy romantic interest (Amber Heard pretty and bland) a glasses-wearing best friend (Lucas Till) a hired assassin with some kind of visual gimmick (Julian McMahon with a bad dye job) and bingo youve got generic product fit for consumption on an airplane in a hotel room or anywhere theres enforced down time.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it (Left to right) Gary Oldman and Liam Hemsworth star in Relativity Medias ""Paranoia."" (Peter Iovino) By Sean OConnell August 15 2013 Big Brother -- the Orwellian type not the reality TV program -- casts his long shadow over the corporate-espionage thriller ""Paranoia."" Using the smart-tech devices clutched in the hands of every millennial the omnipresent being reads e-mails listens to conversations and spies on our loved ones as they relax at home blissfully unaware theyre being observed. Knowing how methodical Big Brother tends to be he is probably even watching this movie desperately wishing a better one could be beamed across the screen. ""Theres nothing original left"" serpentine tech executive Nicolas Wyatt (Gary Oldman) tells his handsome protege Adam Cassidy (Liam Hemsworth) near the start of director Robert Luketics thriller. ""Were all stealing from someone."" Hes right. In the case of ""Paranoia"" screenwriters Jason Dean Hall and Barry Levy swipe plot twists from the film adaptations of best-selling author John Grishams novels. Only back in the day kinetic legal-brief thrillers like ""The Firm"" ""The Pelican Brief"" and ""The Rainmaker"" helped further the careers of Tom Cruise Julia Roberts and Matt Damon respectively. ""Paranoia"" peddles Hemsworth a chiseled hunk who doesnt offer the audience much beyond his good looks. Hemsworth plays Cassidy a blue-collar whiz kid from Brooklyn who dreams of climbing the ranks at Wyatt Corp. a tech giant led by a ruthless chief executive (played by Oldman with his usual brand of live-wire menace). When Cassidy pitches what he believes will be our countrys next great mobile toy Wyatt distracts him with a riskier offer Take a job at rival corporation Eikon; befriend Wyatts nemesis Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford quietly effective); and swipe a blueprint for Eikons latest cellphone before it can reach store shelves. As Cassidy sinks deeper into the criminal quicksand separating Wyatt and Goddard its hard not to realize that ""Paranoia"" boils down to two corrupt billionaires feuding over their share of a saturated market. The FBI threatens to intervene but we spend most of the film wondering which mogul will successfully manipulate this impressionable corporate spy. Tell me again why were supposed to care? Oh sure Luketic occasionally reminds us that Cassidy has a sick father (Richard Dreyfuss making the most of what little hes given) and a stack of medical bills waiting at home. But even that potentially dramatic subplot is shelved for long stretches so Cassidy can romance Emma Jennings (Amber Heard) a pretty marketing executive who turns up at the most coincidental moments. ""Paranoia"" succumbs to formula. Theres tension to be wrung from the premise but Luketic is content to telegraph his movies juiciest twists concentrating instead on applying a sleek visual sheen usually reserved for shampoo commercials. ""Paranoia"" ultimately addresses the chasm separating the underemployed underprivileged Generation Y from the experienced often deceitful white-collar executives who damaged our nations financial landscape and made the current job market so unstable. At the same time the movie also illuminates the gulf separating the up-and-coming class of not-ready-for-prime-time film stars and the seasoned veterans now filling supporting roles. Watching Hemsworth wilt alongside his commanding co-stars I couldnt help but think that some day soon the Fords Oldmans and Dreyfusses of this world are going to attempt to pass the baton to a generation that isnt prepared. And that harsh truth has to make some studio executives paranoid. OConnell is a freelance writer. Paranoia  (106 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some sexuality violence and language. lifestyle style true Please provide a valid email address.

"Liam Hemsworths Paranoia toothless cyber thriller Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLiam Hemsworths Paranoia toothless cyber thriller ReviewThe Hunger Games Liam Hemsworth makes a deal with the digital devil in Robert Luketics unthrilling thriller Paranoia. Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman also star.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Aug. 15 2013ParanoiaStarring Harrison Ford Gary Oldman Liam Hemsworth Amber Heard Embeth Davidtz and Richard Dreyfuss. Directed by Robert Luketic. 106 minutes. Opening Aug. 16 at major theatres. PGLiam Hemsworth is an aspiring one-percenter who makes a deal with the digital devil in director Robert Luketics unthrilling thriller Paranoia.Article Continued BelowThe Hunger Games franchise hunk plays Adam Cassidy a 27-year-old tech whiz who feels hard done by in his efforts to inherit some of the American Dream. He lives at home struggling to cover the hospital fees run up by his widowed and ailing blue-collar dad (Richard Dreyfuss slumming it along with Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman for an easy payday).Sulky pouts wont pay the bills for Adam a tech company drone at Manhattan-based Wyatt Corp. who is plotting a jump to an executive office with his latest whiz-bang idea. But a do-or-die presentation fails to impress Cockney boss Nicholas Wyatt (Oldman doing his best to inject some life into the lacklustre script) and Adam is canned along with his eager team of cyber nerd pals.Revenge is a dish best served with vodka thanks to a post-firing booze-up fraudulently funded by Adams company credit card. When hes caught Wyatt offers Adam a chance to avoid the cops if hell help out with a little espionage. With Wyatts help Adam is to wrangle a top-tier job at rival tech house Eikon (pronounced ""icon"") to find out what cellphone breakthrough Wyatts former business partner and hated rival Jock Goddard (Ford) has on the go. Wyatt promises he will make it worth Adams while.Ford looks ancient no thanks to a skull-baring buzz cut and in one scene baggy dad jeans that do major damage to memories of Indiana Joness ruggedly sexiness. Worse he seems only occasionally engaged with his onscreen duties as Goddard who seems far too anxious to take newcomer Adam under his wing. Perhaps the young go-getter reminds him of his late son.Amber Heard plays Eikons whip-smart marketing ace and reluctant love interest Emma with the sex kept strictly above the covers in a calculated move to get younger viewers into the theatre to see their Hunger heartthrob. She goes from icy brainiac to mushy love bunny in the space of a few scenes yet theres more steam coming from Wyatts tea -- and he complains that its cold.At least watching Oldman chew the scenery and Ford looking like hes trying to remember his lines distracts from the ridiculous and lazily formed plot.At 106 minutes its a long slog rife with dangling threads and a toothless gallery of gotchas including one involving Wyatts creepy corporate psychologist Dr. Judith Bolton (Embeth Davidtz).Paranoia would have been more interesting had Adam been less heroic and more craven rather than insisting hes only in the game to make enough dough to help out the dear old dad -- the same fellow he later dismisses as a loser in the game of life.There isnt even anything paranoid going on in Paranoia even if Adam has every good reason to be suspicious of these creepy cyber kings after an FBI agent shows up with photographic evidence of what happened to others Wyatt had hired to do some snooping.It seems the only people we genuinely fear are out to get us are screenwriters Barry Levy (Vantage Point) and Jason Dean Hall in adapting Joseph Finders novel. In between theres a great deal of tapping on smart phones and looking for hidden cameras but the fine elements of a good corporate thriller are far from view. Its tension free and as a result forgettable. And if the filmmakers fear critics are out to get them with reviews for Paranoia thats not paranoia either; its reality.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

When both turn against him hes forced to fight for his own survival. VPC Scott Bowles USA TODAY 11 a.m. EDT August 16 2013The corporate-espionage thriller has a great cast but its undercut by convention.Liam Hemsworth right is a regular guy working at a tech firm and Harrison Ford plays a corporate titan at a rival firm.(Photo Peter Iovino)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review   out of fourStars Gary Oldman Harrison Ford Liam Hemsworth Amber Heard Richard DreyfussRated PG-13; running time 1 hour 40 minutes; opens Friday nationwideWere it the sum of its formidable parts Paranoia might give good movies an inferiority complex.Alas theres nothing a good film -- or mediocre one for that matter -- need worry about when it comes to this slick but simple-minded thriller (  out of 4 rated PG-13 opens nationwide Friday) featuring a lineup that screams it could have been a contender.Based on the novel by Joseph Finder Paranoia aims to be a Wall Street for the Twitter generation. Instead it plays more like a 21 Jump Street full of pretty people and a thumping soundtrack but offering little in the way of something to say.Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games) plays Adam Cassidy a regular Joe working at a tech firm with ruthless boss Nicholas Wyatt (Gary Oldman).REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersWyatt is a deliciously wicked character one who texts incessantly and complains about cold tea while his underlings make desperate pitches for the companys next high-tech breakthrough.But when Adam makes a pitch that falls flat Wyatt fires him and his dweeb pals prompting Adam to use the corporate credit card for a final blowout a 16000 booze-filled party.Thats all the ammunition Wyatt needs to blackmail him Adam must either steal corporate secrets from a rival firm run by Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford) or explain his drunken thievery to the cops.The setup should be fodder for entertaining corporate espionage perhaps even topical discussion about privacy and information leaks. Instead director Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde Win a Date With Tad Hamilton) opts to substitute car chases for tension and fistfights for suspense.And what a cast he had. Oldman and Ford make terrific corporate titans. Oldman cant help but ooze impatience and contempt for the go-getters looking to create the next Facebook. Ford -- sporting a shaved head and looking nothing like the graying Branch Rickey he played in 42 -- has glided seamlessly into older characters thanks largely to a gravel baritone that has become an effective tool for him. And Richard Dreyfuss plays Adams blue-collar father chewing the scenery and stogies with a disarming grin.But Luketic rests the film squarely on the broad shoulders of his younger cast particularly Hemsworth who simply doesnt have the range the role requires. As he finds himself being squeezed by corporate thugs the FBI and a perky love interest in Emma (Amber Heard) Adam seems ill-equipped to do much but walk around shirtless and pout.There are bright moments. Oldman and Ford share the screen in two scenes that crackle and illuminate what Paranoia might have been. And the technology our cash-obsessed CEOs crave -- tracking software that monitors every movement and every phone even those not turned on -- seems frighteningly plausible.Still every time Paranoia comes close to saying something the story freezes like an overheated cellphone. You might not feel frightened by Paranoia but you could get the sneaking suspicion you were ripped off. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/13m0gydSummer Movies Calendar AugustTake a look at the films heading to the box office this August complete with trailers reviews clips related stories and more.

"Movie review Paranoia has bells and whistles but glitches too - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Movie review Paranoia has bells and whistles but glitches too Paranoia Movie review by Betsy Sharkey Betsy Sharkey reviews Paranoia starring Liam Hemsworth Gary Oldman Amber Heard and Harrison Ford. Betsy Sharkey reviews Paranoia starring Liam Hemsworth Gary Oldman Amber Heard and Harrison Ford. Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic There are roles worth shaving your head for ... Im thinking Anne Hathaways severely shorn locks in ""Les Miserables"" Ben Kingsleys meditative pate in ""Gandhi"" and Oscars for both. Buzzed is an easy way to say tough with real conviction -- Jake Gyllenhaals seared soldier in ""Jarhead"" Natalie Portmans futuristic punk in ""V for Vendetta"" and Charlize Theron taking it down to the roots for next years new edition of ""Mad Max."" And honestly would ""The Rock"" have wrestled his way to movie stardom so memorably if Dwayne Johnson hadnt gone boldly bare?Then there is ""Paranoia."" Did Harrison Ford hope the shorn look would give his high-tech mogul Jock Goddard some edge? He certainly needed something to. There are different issues for Liam Hemsworths leading man Adam Cassidy. Hes a good-looking wait make that fantastic-looking techie wunderkind who gets in the middle of a grudge match between Goddard and another computer kingpin Nicholas Wyatt. Gary Oldman hangs on to his hair though hes asked to ride his British accent a bit too hard.ON LOCATION Where the cameras roll Back to Hemsworth and Adam. Theoretically the movie is about some serious double-crossing with Adam forced by Wyatt to go undercover so he can steal a major new gizmo from Goddard. Screenwriters Jason Hall and Barry Levy adapted Joseph Finders bestselling corporate espionage thriller which gives the film its name but by the time ""Paranoia"" makes it to the screen the thrill is gone.Director Robert Luketic -- whose best work remains his first work 2001s ""Legally Blonde"" starring Reese Witherspoon -- keeps his focus on Adam. Actually make that Hemsworth because its the actor not the character who is the object of his obsession.There are enough beauty shots of Hemsworth to fill every fashion pages in GQ for an entire year. And I have to give it to them -- at least on that front the film delivers. Hemsworth sweats through workouts dresses down in worn flannel shirts and jeans for bar scenes spiffs up in designer suits to fool Goddard and best of all gets tangled up in the sheets with a high-tech honey named Emma (Amber Heard). The camera lingers on as much of that toned-to-perfection 6-foot-3 frame as it can and still hang on to that R.The quote-unquote paranoia is supposed to come from Wyatts evil intentions and the technology that is tracking every move Adam makes. Wyatt sets him up in a modernist dream apartment the better to plant the young man inside Goddards organization. As it happens Adam is kind of like a young Goddard -- both are bootstrap types real scrappers which Goddard will take time to overstate in one of their heart to hearts. Both men suffered painful losses -- Goddard lost a son and Adam lost his mother. Much of the male bonding occurs in Goddards richly appointed library all dark woods and weathered leather. PHOTOS Summer Sneaks 2013 Im not going to get into the acting because theres not much of it frankly. No one is embarrassingly bad; no one is exceptionally good. Better to remember the actors for better thrillers Ford in ""Witness"" Oldham in ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" Hemsworth in ""The Hunger Games.""There are few surprises despite lots of twists and turns as Adam tries to figure a way to escape with his life. If you were hoping for interesting insight into all the ways technology is redefining our world again Id point to you other better stuff like ""The Social Network.""Instead the director gives us more beauty shots. The super-secret projects Goddard is working on including that gizmo Adam is supposed to steal are kept behind a steel gate that is another designers dream -- in brushed-steel boxes on what looks to be velvet-covered podiums with their very own spotlights.Oh I almost forgot -- its easy to get distracted by all the pretty -- there is one role worth remembering. The reason Adam is willing to break laws and risk his life is his dad Richard Dreyfuss. Not his real dad his movie dad a crusty old-timer. Some of their moments are really sweet and there is not one drip of sarcasm in that particular observation. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com----------------------------- PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Liam Hemsworth Paranoia (movie) Entertainment Movies Dwayne Johnson Harrison Ford Theft On the Set Movies and TV Review Lee Daniels The Butler significant but often contrived Review Aint Them Bodies Saints is a romantic sinner Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-paranoia-review,0,2168914.story",200,paranoia21,paranoia,latimes

More by Steven Rea Introducing Phillys Maris Curran director of Five Nights in Maine Jul 29 Weekend Movie Selections Jul 30 Bad Moms Mila Kunis and writers from The Hangover skewer the mommy wars raunchily Jul 29 If Harrison Ford looks particularly peeved when he finally shows up (40 minutes in) in the corporate espionage caper Paranoia it could be because of the script hes been handed. As one of the dueling tech titans pulling the puppet strings on the movies blue-eyed broad-shouldered cant-act-his-way-out-of-a-paper-bag hero (Liam Hemsworth) Ford has to condemn the young upstarts ""blind ambition"" and warn him that ""Im going to make your life a living hell"" More about Paranoia >> Gary Oldman as Fords archrival gets his share of freshly minted gems too. ""Youll never get away with this"" he cries at one point. Well he should be crying. Set in New York (and shot mostly in Philly - see below) Paranoia has the requisite components of a cool modern thriller a glassy electronic score; quick jarring cutaways; sleek modern interiors; a ""hipster"" hero with a posse of nerdy cute coworkers. What it lacks is even an iota of originality. Directed by Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde) from an adaptation of the Joseph Finder novel Paranoia finds Hemsworths Adam Cassidy struggling to make ends meet. His dad (Richard Dreyfuss) is on oxygen and in and out of the hospital and after a social-media software presentation to his boss Nicolas Wyatt (Oldman) fails to impress Adam and his gang are given the heave-ho. But Wyatt Industries isnt done with Adam. The squirrely CEO wants him to go to work for the competition - Wyatts onetime business partner Jock Goddard (Ford) - to steal the design of a new smartphone. It is of course a smartphone like no other. It will revolutionize the communications industry and make whoever owns the technology exceedingly rich. Adam isnt comfortable with this spy business but he has no choice - and Goddard seems to like him as does his marketing whiz Emma Jennings (Amber Heard) with whom it so happens Adam had already had a one-night stand. It isnt long before Adam and Emma make that two nights and then three. Cue the love-making montage. Hemsworth who is Gale Hawthorne in The Hunger Games and the brother of the Hemsworth who stars as Thor has maybe one arrow in his acting quiver - he can look engaged. He looks engaged when hes canoodling with Heard he looks engaged when hes running down an alley being chased by goons he looks engaged when hes thumbing the keys of his smartphone and when he takes off his T-shirt and walks around in his jeans. Unfortunately he never once looks paranoid even when he discovers the cameras and microphones planted all over the fancy new apartment Wyatt has set him up in. The movies called Paranoia dude. Get on it Of parochial note While a hundred skyline fly-over shots keep reminding us that Paranoia takes place in the Big Apple (and Dreyfuss wears a Yankees cap and the license plates all read ""New York"") the movie was shot mainly in Philadelphia. Here are a few of the landmarks and locations that Hemsworth Heard Ford Oldman and company can be seen in and around the Comcast Center tower the Beasley Building the Lanesborough condominiums the Kimmel Center the concourse beneath Broad Street the sidewalks of 20th and Spruce Streets Third and Race Streets in Old City and the Moravian Street alley where Hemsworth in the opening shot of Paranoia is running for his life.

Okay then whom do we blame? We shouldnt blame Harrison Ford or Gary Oldman -- an ""Air Force One"" rematch -- doing aging-CEO archetypes as dueling tech-firm industrialists. Their decades-old battle draws in a young buck named Adam Cassidy (Hemsworth) who apparently likes to be shirtless whenever possible. Cassidy falls into this web when hes fired from Oldmans firm then brought back in by a corporate fixer (Embeth Davidtz) to spy on Fords company. The goal obtain intel on a super-secret new device being developed that could change the world. Along the way Hemsworth (best known as Katniss District 12 boyfriend in ""The Hunger Games"") beds a pretty marketing exec (Amber Heard). The big dogs though are watching Cassidys every move. As often happens in glossy techno-thrillers theres the usual urgent keyboard surfing to download information some ridiculous touches -- such as Fords savvy magnate tossing the newbie kid the keys to his gorgeous sports car -- and silly plot-deepening moments. The most inane is when Cassidy learns the bad guys are spying on his ailing father played by Richard Dreyfuss who has about as much chance of siring someone who looks like Hemsworth as he does of winning an actual Hunger Games. Liam Hemsworth (l.) and Gary Oldman star in Paranoia. (Peter Iovino) Director Robert Luketic made the Katherine Heigl bombs ""Killers"" and ""The Ugly Truth"" and the alleged comedies ""Monster-in-Law"" ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" and ""Legally Blonde."" Here Luketic tries to keep the steely New York edge (some of which was blatantly shot in Philly). The film cant decide if its a were-being-watched thriller or a ""Wall Street""-lite business-world actioner. As for Hemsworth hes a hunky lunk and theres zero chemistry between him and the pretty-but-icy Heard. Oldman using a tough-guy Cockney accent is good as always and a shaved-head Ford emanates a whispery menace in the few scenes he has. They do whats required but ""Paranoias"" twitchiness is like an actual twitch its contrived and clunky and you forget it in an instant.

"Paranoia 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Paranoia 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Paranoia Bad2 stars Director Robert Luketic.Cast Liam Hemsworth Harrison Ford Gary Oldman Amber Heard.Rating PG-13 for some sexuality violence and language. By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Aug 15 2013 1032 AM You know that feeling you get when youre out with somebody -- on a date say or to Sunday brunch with a friend you havent seen in a while -- and they ignore you for their smart phone? That boredom that sets in when the conversation dries up that gradually morphs into a desperate abandoned sensation that makes you wonder why you even came? ""Paranoia"" is like nearly two hours of that feeling. Its partly on account of the premise Two rival tech moguls in the cellphone business are out to destroy one another. Its not sexy stuff in 2013 (or ever really) a cat-and-mouse game between two old rich dudes who make cellphones. Of course it doesnt help that the movie is directed with all the panache and passion of a Ciroc commercial (or Apple or Pepsi -- pick your shameless-product-placement poison). But all the crackerjack filmmaking in the world couldnt make convoluted conversations about imaginary cellphone technology interesting. Also not helping matters is Liam Hemsworth in his first leading-man role of note. The Australian hunk plays Adam Cassidy an entry-level employee who works for ruthless tech-company CEO Nicolas Wyatt (a nattily dressed Gary Oldman). After bungling a presentation and getting himself into a fix that compromises not only his job but his legal record Adam is strong-armed by Wyatt into agreeing to engage in undercover corporate espionage against a rival company. Adam is groomed to fit into the world of the 1 percent outfitted with a fancy wardrobe and a three-story Manhattan apartment and in no time hes hired by Jock Goddard (Harrison Ford) former-work-associate-turned-rival of Wyatt. Adam is effectively a plant and its his job to scope out Goddards company for game-changing innovations under increasing pressure from Wyatt. Nothing about Hemsworth crackles onscreen. The most impressive aspect of his character is his hairs ability to remain perfectly moussed after a wild night on the town and through the next mornings hungover walk of shame. His lack of leading-man charisma is especially egregious when he shares so much screen-time with Ford whos delightful even when hes slumming. One wonders why they couldnt have rewritten the central part to be a woman -- or short of that Hollywood blasphemy slapped a beard on Amber Heard and let her have a crack at it. Shes sexy and smart as Emma Jennings a cutthroat scion of privilege but relegated to the thankless role of romantic interest. The films only real delights come courtesy of Ford and Oldman who are fantastic even when theyve checked whatever dignity they have left at the door for a paycheck. The irascible old men trade deliciously hammy jabs in their shared screen-time -- of which they dont get enough. Instead were treated to the primal boredom of watching pretty people on a big screen fiddle with other smaller screens. ""Paranoia"" is ostensibly a thriller but theres nothing remotely thrilling about it. The slick plodding bore is as exciting as watching somebody else tap out text messages. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> I smiled twice during Paranoia. Both times when Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman had scenes together and hammed it up like pros in hog heaven. They play tech-firm tycoons out to take each other down. The rest of this alleged thriller is minus suspense soul and any valid reason for being. Liam Hemsworth Thors brother plays Adam - the young stud in a suit who gets between these two swinging dicks. Hes way out of his league. And his romance with a marketing babe (gorgeous Amber Heard) gives pro forma a bad name. Director Robert Luketic whose movies range from decent (Legally Blonde 21) to disastrous (Killers The Ugly Truth) has no game here. How could he with a script by Barry L. Levy and Jason Hall based on the novel by Joseph Finder that packs all the oomph of a straight-to-video write-off. It galls me that Hollywood thinks were shallow enough to swallow this swill.

"Paranoia (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Paranoia (PG-13) A would-be thriller set in the world of corporate espionage short-circuits. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com8/15/2013 Editor rating 2 ""I wanted more"" says ambitious young Adam Cassidy at the start of the thriller Paranoia. Adam is explaining via voiceover how he got caught in a web of deceit but watching this movie I know how he feels. Based on the novel by Joseph Finder Paranoia has a promising foundation -- betrayal danger and corporate espionage are solid building blocks of suspense. But the movie turns out to be more exasperating than exciting. There are warning signs. Director Robert Luketic is responsible for some frightening missteps -- Killers with Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl; The Ugly Truth with Gerard Butler and Katherine Heigl; Win a Date with Tad Hamilton with Topher Grace and somebody who wasnt Katherine Heigl. Paranoia isnt quite so misguided but theres too much here that doesnt ring true or make any sense beyond script convenience. Liam Hemsworth (The Hunger Games) who is extremely pretty but whom nobody will confuse with Ryan Gosling come Oscar night plays Adam who lives with his ailing father (Richard Dreyfuss) in Brooklyn. Adam toils in obscurity at a tech company with his friends and cant get in the high-end clubs not even looking the way he does (though perhaps he might have a better shot if he ditched his hoodie). But Adam as he has mentioned wants More. He has plans to wow his CEO Nicolas Wyatt (Gary Oldman) by making ""the pitch of his life"" about cellphone technology. Things go badly -- ostensibly not because hes still wearing the hoodie at the most important meeting of his life but you have to wonder -- and everybody gets fired. In a moment of pure idiocy Adam encourages his friends to drink all night on Wyatts dime and finds himself summoned to the office the next day. But his crafty boss borrowing Michael Caines accent for the duration of the film doesnt want his money back. He blackmails Adam into going undercover at a rival tech firm run by his old mentor (Harrison Ford) to steal a prototype for a revolutionary new product. The plot takes a few nice twists but would anyone genuinely believe doe-eyed Adam could pull off this heist in a security-obsessed building? Even though hes bedding the companys marketing director (Amber Heard) and sneaking access to her computer files? Fortunately shes careless with her passwords which is exactly the sort of dumb cheap shortcut Paranoias script relies on one too many times. Luketic wants to disturb the audience by turning the very technology Adam loves against him as Wyatts cameras track him everywhere and time and Wyatts patience begin to run out. But honestly the most disturbing thing in the film are the distractingly waxed eyebrows of Julian McMahon who plays a henchman. In the end Paranoia cant make you nervous enough to care. Cast Liam Hemsworth Harrison Ford Gary Oldman Amber Heard Josh Holloway Julian McMahon. Director Robert Luketic. Screenwriters James Dean Hall Barry Levy. Based on the novel by Joseph Finder. Producers William D. Johnson Alexandra Milchan Deepak Nayer. A Relativity Media release. Running time 106 minutes. Some sexuality violence vulgar language. Opens Friday Aug. 16 at area theaters.

Share Tweet For a movie set in the cutting-edge evolve-or-die world of smartphone engineering Paranoia feels hopelessly passe. Beyond a few digs at Wall Street corruption and many many shots of characters swiping at touch screens this corporate-espionage thriller from director Robert Luketic (21 Killers) could easily have been conceived two decades ago. The cliches are as old as AOL Theres a scene where the hero a blackmailed corporate climber played by Liam Hemsworth (brother of Chris) waits on pins and needles for a download to complete his eyes darting nervously between the slow-crawling progress bar and the running shower in the other room. In another familiar moment a security guard stops the up-to-no-good protagonist (""Mr. Cassidy..."") pauses for an inordinately long period of time and then says something innocuous (""...working late tonight?""). And the film basically ends with he hoariest convention of them all a comeuppance that should heretofore be permanently retired from movies if for no other reason than no actual fat-cat villain would ever fall for it again. (Hint Tape recorders exist.) Unceremoniously shitcanned for thinking big--""This pitch is gonna change our lives"" are his famous last words to the team--a distraught Hemsworth charges his 16000 bar tab on the company credit card. (Are the Red Bull-and-vodkas served in hollowed-out Faberge eggs?) His former boss a hammy Gary Oldman offers him the choice between jail time and going undercover at another tech company run by the moguls old business partner (Harrison Ford sporting a chrome dome and chewing the scenery nearly as voraciously as he did in this springs 42). After a weekend at Embeth Davidtzs executive boot camp where his grooming includes playing symbolic chess games while wearing sunglasses mini-Thor ends up successfully infiltrating the rival corporation. Here he grapples with pangs of guilt provoked by stern lectures from his sickly father (Richard Dreyfuss looking very sick indeed) and a budding romance with colleague Amber Heard who he randomly hooked up with at the club a few days earlier. Surely that chance encounter must be no accident but a product of the inevitable long-con the film is building towards. Nope its just a wildly unlikely coincidence. As a post-financial-crisis movie Paranoia is muddled at best wagging its finger at Hemsworths ambitious bridge-and-tunnel type while fetishizing the life of luxury he cheats his way into. As a thriller its downright laughable featuring scenes of corporate henchmen performing hit-and-runs in broad daylight. (Hired gun Julian McMahon displays none of the caution and deadly finesse of say the killers in Michael Clayton.) The title doesnt even make much sense as the element of theyre-always-watching dread doesnt pop up until the last half hour or so. The film works only if at all as an unofficial Air Force One reunion with Ford stopping just short of bellowing ""Get off my jock"" during a pair of gritted-teeth encounters with Oldman. Some pleasures never go out of fashion.

That line often attributed to Picasso pops up in ""Paranoia"" and while theres plenty in the film that feels either copied or stolen theres nothing particularly good great or even artistic about it. This lazy rehash of already-mediocre thrillers like ""Eagle Eye"" and ""Duplicity"" grinds along like a badly-told joke where both the comic and the audience can tell its not working but theres no choice but for all parties to grit their teeth and get through it. Its twists are either predictable or improbable and its double-crosses are so inert theyre more like crosses-and-a-half. See video Harrison Ford Introduces First Enders Game Footage Gary Oldman and Harrison Ford no doubt relished the opportunity to pick up checks for doing the slightest amount of work possible but the existence of ""Paranoia"" will no doubt soon be forgotten by its viewers and probably be denied by its makers. Liam Hemsworth (""The Hunger Games"") stars as Adam an ambitious young employee at a tech firm run by Nicholas Wyatt (Oldman). Wyatt is so unimpressed by the presentation pitch offered up by Adam and his team that he fires the lot of them; in revenge Adam uses the corporate credit card meant for research and underwrites a boozy blowout at a trendy Manhattan night spot. The next day Wyatt threatens to turn Adam over to the cops unless the young up-and-comer will participate in a little corporate skullduggery Nicholas associate Judith (Embeth Davidtz) will Pygmalion Adam into the perfect job candidate for a rival company run by Wyatts old mentor Jock Goddard (Ford). Once inside its Adams job to steal a prototype smartphone that Goddards company is developing. See video Liam Hemsworth Steals Secrets - and Yes Hearts - in Trailer for Paranoia Among the co-workers that Adam has to con and dazzle is Emma (Amber Heard) a marketing whiz; they shared a one-night stand after Adams wild night on the town but he was too drunk to remember it. Adam and Goddard begin to bond the FBI shows up with photos of previous Wyatt employees who were killed and suddenly Adam doesnt know who to trust or when hes being monitored. The screenplay by Barry L. Levy (""Vantage Point"") and Jason Hall based on the novel by Joseph Finder runneth over with information thats introduced and never mentioned again out-of-character bumbling at key moments and a general lack of internal logic. Director Robert Luketic has been on the antithesis of a roll since his sprightly feature debut ""Legally Blonde."" His long row of clunkers (""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton"" ""Monster-in-Law"" ""21"" ""The Ugly Truth"" and ""Killers"") just gets longer with this latest disappointment; there are a few flourishes of style and the occasional moment where he remembers the movie is called ""Paranoia"" and shows Adam obsessively looking over his shoulder but this is about as unthrilling as thrillers come. Also read Harrison Ford Set to Join Sylvester Stallone in The Expendables 3 While Heard proves its possible to look gorgeous and intelligent at the same time Hemsworth can only manage a handsome blankness. Richard Dreyfuss amiably chews the scenery for a few appearances as Adams blue-collar dad and if nothing else we get two scenes where Ford (sporting a bald head) and Oldman get to go toe-to-toe. Those fleeting moments arent enough to justify the rest of this snooze-fest unfortunately. Paranoia is the sensation that others are out to get you; ""Paranoia"" merely provides the feeling that youve wasted the price of a movie ticket on a forgettable August release.
