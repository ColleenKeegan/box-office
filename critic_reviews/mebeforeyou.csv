This adaptation of Jojo Moyess best-seller (scripted by the novelist herself) might have the structure of a comfort-food weepie but its a rom-com with brains. The movie manages to shift sensitively from laugh-out-loud moments to tear-jerking scenes discussing euthanasia on the way. Its not perfect but the books millions of readers have nothing to worry about. Naive unambitious Louisa (Emilia Clarke elsewhere the Mother of Dragons on Game of Thrones) takes a job caring for quadriplegic millionaire Will (Sam Claflin). It turns out Will was an adventuresome man of action before a motorcycle accident left him paralyzed from the neck down. Unable to live the life he wants hes depressed angry and ready to die. Of course this being what it is opposites eventually attract teaching each other valuable life lessons along the way. Yet Me Before You is not all by-the-book The films most interesting scenes deal with Wills life in a wheelchair rather than romantic love. His embarrassment when Louisa asks a group of men to help push him out of some mud is painfully relatable. The surprise scene-stealer here is Harry Potter alum Matthew Lewis who plays Louisas personal-trainer boyfriend as the perfect parody of an exercise-obsessed narcissistic millennial. Claflin meanwhile does his best Christian Grey impression as Will and Clarkes Louisa is enjoyably awkward clomping around Wills house with the kind of goofy realism thats been lacking from romance films since Bridget Joness Diary. Her character isnt entirely convincing (theres a skit about her calling pesto ""green gravy"" that just doesnt work) but but your mom will love this--make room for her too.

Entertainment ""Me Before You"" Mistreats Its Disabled Character For The Sake Of Romance Honestly fuck the whole concept of this new romantic weepy about a woman tasked with convincing a man with quadriplegia who has a death wish -- both played by able-bodied young stars -- that life is worth living. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin in Me Before You. Alex Bailey / Warner Bros. ID 8789436 Me Before You is another love story overshadowed by death. Here a young woman named Louisa (Emilia Clarke) who goes by Lou falls for Will (Sam Claflin) the man shes been hired to keep company whose accident two years earlier made him quadriplegic. Louisa and Will are older than the teen couples in The Fault in Our Stars and If I Stay -- shes in her mid-twenties and hes in his early thirties -- but the film is very much a continuation of the recent resurgence in teary romances in which hearts are more stalwart than the bodies in which they reside and love collides with mortality so hard that whole forests worth of tissue arent enough to dry the audiences eyes.The difference is -- and its quite a difference -- Will isnt dying like Fault in Our Stars Hazel or A Walk to Remembers Jamie; Will wants to die. He has decided to end his life and its only because he made a deal with his parents (Charles Dance and Janet McTeer) to hold off for six months that he hasnt yet follow through with his plan to travel to Switzerland where assisted suicide is legal. Louisa unknowingly arrives during this period desperate for a new job after having been laid off by the cafe where she worked for six years. She steps into Wills world after hes put a time limit on it when hes testy and depressive waiting in frustration. As he thaws to her bubbly charms (she is he notes distastefully upon meeting her ""chatty"" a quality he comes to appreciate) and as feelings well up between them she becomes determined to prove to him that life is worth living -- especially when its with her. View this image > Clarke in Me Before You. Alex Bailey / Warner Bros. ID 8789497 Honestly? Fuck this whole concept.Me Before You which Thea Sharrock directed and Jojo Moyes adapted from her 2012 novel never reconciles its hanky-wringing aims with the fact that its tragic male lead always has the option of choosing to live. Wills no longer the dashing athletic finance bro living with his beautiful girlfriend (Vanessa Kirby) in a spacious loft that we get a glimpse of in the films opening minutes. He relies on a wheelchair and the help of his two caregivers Lou and occupational therapist Nathan (Steve Peacocke) who takes care of the physical aspects Lou isnt responsible for. He can no longer climb mountains or ski down them or anything close and hes susceptible to pneumonia. But Me Before You makes it clear that its not the difficulty of Wills new life thats the real problem -- he admits that he could still have a good life -- but that he cant reconcile what he lost. He was the shiny bright master of the universe once and now hes dependent on others and because of it thinks hed be better off dead.Its a point of view that anyone actually living with a serious disability and in all likelihood without the resources to have ones stables converted into sleek wheelchair-friendly living quarters will undoubtably find enraging. But its also a galling thing to underlie a romance despite Claflin doing his best to sell Will as a Byronic hero slowly softening to the warmth of his working-class companion. Me Before You has an old-fashioned center a romance in which a moody aristocrats heart is captured by an unsophisticated young woman whom he raises up with his attentions. Lous family is loving but poor sharing an overstuffed but lively house while Wills is wealthy repressed and literally owns a castle. Lou favors quirky sweaters and colorful tights and talks self-deprecatingly about the patrician blondes Wills used to in a way that might have more zing if she werent herself played by an actor famous for the role of a platinum-maned queen. Will broadens Lous horizons with foreign films and stories about Paris reconnecting with the world through her experiences. Or at least thats Lous hope. View this image > Chaflin in Me Before You. Alex Bailey / Warner Bros. ID 8789532 Of course they fall in love sometimes sweetly especially in the enchanting scene in which Lou accompanies Will to his exs wedding and they spin together on the dance floor Lou perched on Wills lap. Then everything crumbles to pieces when the movie returns to its emotional blackmailing premise in which Will has to decide if hes going to stick with his resolution and if so how Lou will react. This being a tearjerker you can guess what his choice is but that doesnt make it any less brutally manipulative of a development especially given the way Wills death wish is positioned as a result of depression. A drama in which everyone lips trembling approves of an able-bodied persons desire for suicide would be obviously repellent but in Me Before You a mans suicidal ideation is treated as tragic but understandable his disability making his life less worth saving.Isnt that romantic?

Those eyebrows are a wonder -- thick brown caterpillars in a synchronized caterpillar-rumba competition. They lift they leap they curl up they curl down they waggle impishly. At times they soar as high as her hairline turning her forehead into a series of tight grooves reminiscent of pale corduroy. Should her top choppers come out while her eyebrows are vaulting her visage becomes a Stan Laurel mask -- a smile on the brink of tears because a) this is a tragic love story and b) it must be painful doing calisthenics with your face. It goes without saying that Clarke is attempting to differentiate her character -- also named Clark though without an ""e"" -- from Game of Throness Daenerys Targaryen a.k.a. Khaleesi a.k.a. Mother of Dragons a.k.a.A Woman Who Walks Naked Out of Fire. I imagine shell want to incinerate a roomful of critics when she reads her reviews but she should turn the flames on her director Thea Sharrock who could have easily dialed Clarke down a notch or ten. Her character -- the inexperienced working-class caregiver for a 30-ish quadriplegic so rich that his parents have an ancient castle beside the castle in which they live -- is meant to be sweetly clumsy with the fashion instincts of a 6-year-old who has been conked on the head (each new assemblage of fuzzy tops tiny polka-dot skirts and bumblebee tights is a fright) but Clarke is so insistent on becoming the new adorkable life force that shes excruciating to watch. The movie makes you admire all the more her restrained power in Game of Thrones in which her eyebrows are largely stationary. Me Before You features a slew of other actors better known for other work Finnick from The Hunger Games series; Tywin Lannister (who never shared the screen with Daenerys); Bates from Downton Abbey;A and the genuinely adorable Clara companion of two Dr. Whos. Finnick -- Sam Claflin -- plays Will Traynor an avid sportsman and leveraged-buyout king who is hit by a motorcycle in the prologue and now simmers balefully at anyone in his orbit. His parents -- Janet McTeer and Charles Dance -- are helpless. They hire Clark in desperation and after several seasons change she brings sunshine and whimsy to his benighted life while he expands her world with subtitled movies and classical music. ""We found love right where we are"" sings the ever-redundant Ed Sheeran in one of the films many montages. Fans of the best-selling novel by Jojo Moyes will be heartened to hear that she wrote the screenplay too and that she has preserved all the lines that -- when read aloud -- will provide much mirth at your next dinner party. Sensibly deciding he cant compete with Clarke Claflin underplays tastefully and doesnt come off too badly -- though I always thought he looked like a studly guy sitting in a chair rather than someone paralyzed. When Will decides that despite the showers of pixie dust from his working-class Tinkerbell he can no longer abide his life he makes plans to go to Switzerland to end it all. Will Will be swayed by Clarkes Clark? Apparently quadriplegics are livid over Wills earnest case for assisted suicide. Their consolation should be that Me Before You has as much relation to the real world as Emilia Clarkes eyebrows.  This review originally misidentified Tywin Lannisters first name.

David Ehrlich Jun 3 2016 235 pm davidehrlich Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk Me Before You ""Me Before You"" is such a wonderfully uncynical movie that it almost doesnt matter that it isnt very good. Adapted by Jojo Moyes from her beloved 2012 novel of the same name this industrial-strength tear-jerker has all the subtlety of being hit by a runaway motorcycle but its amazing how even the most strained of love stories can be completely revitalized by a palpable human touch. This may look like a Nicolas Sparks knockoff but the difference between ""A Walk to Remember"" and ""Me Before You"" is the difference between ""2001"" and ""Chappie."" Louisa Clark (""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke hardly recognizable without her dragons) is a spirited 26-year-old from a struggling middle-class family. Essentially a live-action Disney princess Lou dresses as though shes channeled all of the excitement thats missing from her life into her eccentric wardrobe and she wears her emotions so broadly on her face that she might as well be a human emoji. Alas this bubbly creature is a bit down in the dumps -- the bakery where she works has been forced to lay her off and Lou is growing convinced that her potential is as dim as her job prospects. Shes lost sight of what the world has to offer her and what she might have to offer the world in return. Desperate for work Lou interviews to be a caregiver for Will Traynor the newly quadriplegic hunk who lives with his family in the massive castle at the center of town. Showing up to the audition in an 80s-era power-suit that splits down the thigh as soon as she meets Wills severe mother (Janet McTeer) Lou couldnt be more clearly unqualified to care for another human being. Shes hired on the spot. READ MORE ""Me Before You"" Director Thea Sharrock Discusses Bringing the Book to the Screen As per the grand tradition of thinly veiled ""Beauty and the Beast"" knockoffs Will is a miserable ass until the new woman in his life finds a way to pierce his icy veneer. Embodied with terrific pompousness by ""Hunger Games"" star Sam Claflin the actor uses his high cheekbones and peevish eyes to convey everything about the man Will was before the runaway motorcycle accident that crippled him (Claflin reportedly lost a bunch of weight for the role but even bound to his motorized wheelchair its clear that hes still a strapping physical specimen). ""Me Before You"" Shes poor and provincial but she has the world at her feet. Hes rich and experienced but has no feeling in his legs. Lou and Will inevitably fall in love and begin to see life anew through the joy they give one another but theres one snag that keeps the romance anchored to the ground Will wants to kill himself. Directed with rare intimacy by theater veteran Thea Sharrock (she oversaw the recent revival of ""Equus"" fronted by Daniel Radcliffe) ""Me Before You"" bends some of its genres most tiresome tropes into a love story that hits with the blunt impact of a broken heart. This is a glossy melodrama fit for the multiplexes (Remi Adefarasins sparkling cinematography allows the movie to double as a feature-length ad for Wales) but it hits a nerve because Moyes story never betrays its characters or what they want from the world and because the sweetness of its candied telling doesnt overwhelm the  truths at its core. Cliches abound Of course Lou has a boyfriend (Matthew Lewis who seems to have been injected by the Captain America serum since his days as Neville Longbottom) and of course hes such a complete dolt that no one will judge Lou for ditching him at the end of the second act. In fact for a film about such an unfortunate predicament much of the messiness is swept under the rug. Lou never has to confront the ugly physical realities of caring for a severely impaired person as Will has a kind aide (Aussie actor Stephen Peacoke) who takes care of all the dirty work. As narratively convenient as that may be its also a reasonable setup for a super-rich man who needs round-the-clock assistance. Moyes and Sharrock however have no such excuse when it comes to why their film elides so many of its most traumatic moments. ""Me Before You"" isnt ""Amour"" nor does it have to be but the blunt emotional honesty of its story is only sustained by circumventing so many of the tragic details that might have galvanized Wills dire situation. ""Me Before You"" wants you to cry but it doesnt want you to suffer. Its a difficult needle to thread -- to quote the Ed Sheeran song that inevitably plays over the climactic moments ""Loving can hurt. Loving can hurt sometimes"" -- and one that the film negotiates by coating its unflinchingly frank melodrama with a thick layer of Hollywood shine. But the human element shines through thanks in large part to Sharrocks flair for intimacy -- most of the movie is set in the excited air between Clark and Claflins faces -- and the sincerity of her films supporting characters the boyfriend notwithstanding. In most versions of this story Wills parents would be borderline monsters who felt as though their son had failed them and the fact that his father is played by Charles Dance (whose characters typically range from ""evil"" to ""the most evil"") braces you to assume the worst. But while the Traynors have their understandable share of disappointments their love for Will is every bit as palpable as their diminished hopes for his future. It also helps that Lou thaws into less of a cartoon as ""Me Before You"" begins to flip the script on most popcorn melodramas -- here the manic pixie dream girl is the one whos lost the swing in her step and the man shes been sent to fix is literally broken beyond repair. ""I can make you happy"" Lou pleads to Will but she may not be able to make him whole. This is a Movie with a capital ""M"" but its the rare romance that becomes more beautiful by virtue of how it recognizes that even true love has its limits. Grade B- ""Me Before You"" is now playing in theaters. Get the latest Box Office news Sign up for our Box Office newsletter here.

Reply Benito R. July 8 2016 356 pm Overall Great film by the director Thea Sharrock and the novel of Jojo Moyes. Louisa Clark is portrayed as a curious yet happy and energetic character and its clearly visible by her daily outfits she wears. When she meets Will Traynor she is not a fan of him but she doesnt mind because she comes from a middle class and needs the money. Their was scene when they were at Wills ex-girlfriends wedding when Louisa was used as the male gaze with the red dress and Will as well as other guest staring at her. Reply Turki Turki July 15 2016 400 pm I couldnt imagine the film without Emilia Clarke as if I was watching Emilia Clarke playing that role not the film in its entirety. Absolutely brilliant Oscar-deserving acting by her how responsive and reflective are her eyebrows voice her face expression and body language as a whole well suited for the role. The depiction of the story as I havent read the book yet seems to have the quite normal elements of any other novel except that it just puts a disabled person in the center. Apart from having a disabled character on screen which is rarely found in Hollywood movies it still feels it is from an abled persons perspective or probably gaze (borrowing Mulveys term). Ive read somewhere that in the actual book Lou finds many examples of disabled people living their lives to the fullest reminding of Wills phrase to Lou ""It is your duty to live your life to the fullest"" however Will seems to be one of those few people who dont see it that way unless they are complete. The issue is that the movie did not show that which made an impression that it was sending a message that one cannot live their life unless its Wills way and that optimal solution is suicide so that also they dont be dependent on their families. I also think the movie failed to move ones emotion to empathize with Will or disabled people if it was one of the goals. I have to say I enjoyed some of the conversations having philosophical components yet the movie wasnt long enough to include some at length. Some characters werent seen much although they give an impression to have played quite a role like Lous sister. Its also not clear how she said she was leaving for school and then she appears in some other scenes later. Finally I have to point out to something I noticed the actors of the movies were all white as far as I remember there was only one non-white character that showed up for less than a minute and that was it Said the guy who was helping Lou find a job at the beginning. It appears as if he was only put there so that the movie is not 100% white in other words Tokenism. Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

"Me Before You | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; me-before-you ) Me Before You (United States 2016) June 02 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Spoilers This review contains spoilers for those who havent read the source material and/or dont know where the story is going. There are bad tearjerkers and good tearjerkers. There are Nicolas Sparks films and movies like Me Before You. What differentiates the latter from the former is easily recognized but hard to put into words. Its an absence of overt manipulation. Its allowing the humanity of the characters to overcome the necessities of plot. Productions like Me Before You (based on Jojo Moyes well-loved novel) allow the protagonists to breathe. It lets them become real and although they eventually must follow the plots dictates their progression seems organic. As a result tears flow more naturally. If one was to base an opinion of Me Before You on its high-level summary the movie would sound like the ultimate downer. Its about a paralyzed man Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) who is determined to end his life at the conclusion of a six-month ""waiting period"" he has promised his parents Camilla (Janet McTeer) and Steven (Charles Dance). While enduring the last weeks of an existence that has become intolerable Will is paired with a ""companion"" the quirky and charming Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke). After an awkward period of adjustment the two become friendly and the friendship develops into something more. In the end however even love cannot shake Wills determination. Louisa is played by Emilia Clarke known worldwide for her portrayal of the fierce ""Mother of Dragons"" and would-be queen of Westeros Daenerys Targaryen in HBOs Game of Thrones. Despite their vast differences in temperament and physical appearance Clarke is able to imbue both characters with life and personality. Her Louisa is shy and flighty a ""chatty"" young woman whose bizarre fashion sense raises eyebrows everywhere. She is instantly likable and her perspective is the perfect portal into this tragic love story. The key to Louisa is that shes sharp witty and courageous. She remains so throughout the film - a critical quality when the movie traverses the emotionally rocky territory of its final act. Clarkes counterpart Sam Claflin is no stranger to genre tales - he played Finnick in three of the four Hunger Games movies and William (Snow Whites prince) in the two Huntsman films. Handsome and brooding Will cuts a dashing figure even in his wheelchair. Hes a more complex character than Louisa. His current existence isnt enough. By his own admission before his accident he loved life and as a result his circumstances are insupportable. Were left to determine whether his solution is selfish or selfless. The movie doesnt address the morality of assisted suicide but puts its personal ramifications under the magnifying scope. Will is never dishonest about his intentions and Me Before You offers a stark reminder that no matter how powerful love may be it doesnt necessarily conquer all. The supporting cast is peppered with recognizable names. Janet McTeer and Charles Dance play Wills parents. Although these characters initially seem cut from the whole cloth of upper class stereotypes we soon recognize theres more to them than we initially suppose. A short scene in which they discuss their divergent views of Wills decision illustrates this. Matthew Lewis provides some comic relief as Louisas self-centered fitness nut boyfriend. Stephen Peacocke is Wills nurse and Jenna Coleman (Doctor Whos Clara Oswald) is Louisas prettier more driven sister. Director Thea Sharrock (making her feature debut) working from Moyes screenplay avoids a plethora of landmines. For at least its first two-thirds Me Before You maintains an upbeat tone. Will and Louisas interactions are predominantly lighthearted and the serious moments are never maudlin. Next to the performances the movies strength is its emotional honesty. Its easy to mess up a story like this trying too hard to make the characters likable and to wring tears from the viewers eyes. Sharrock achieves both aims with a deftness of touch. I am by nature a cynic and am easily turned off by manufactured sentiment. I dislike Terms of Endearment intensely. That I was fully immersed in this world and invested in the characters lives is a testament to the movies strength. Its not perfect - there are times when the pacing is off and the epilogue tries too hard to end things on a positive note - but its effective and affecting. Fans of the genre will be pleased and everyone is advised to bring a package of Kleenexes to the theater. Youll need them.

Its utter predictability is entirely intentional. By Peter Rainer Film critic June 3 2016 Save for later Saved Me Before You stars Emilia Clarke (l.) and Sam Claflin (r.). Alex Bailey/Warner Bros. Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Youve got to hand it to the people who made ""Me Before You"" a four-hankie movie about a gawky working-class caregiver and the glamorous and wealthy quadriplegic she tends to. Every tear is jerked right on cue. Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") is Louisa ""Lou"" Clark who dresses up in florid outfits that appear to be culled from tag sales and dashing Will Traynor is played by the almost cartoonishly handsome Sam Claflin (""The Hunger Games""). These polar opposites become the be-all in each others lives. Of course.Adapted by Jojo Moyes from her bestseller and directed by Thea Sharrock a theater director making her movie debut ""Me Before You"" is the kind of weepie that signals its every move a mile away. Its utter predictability is entirely intentional. We are meant to bask in all the usual romance-novel tropes. Any surprise - any artistry - would just get in the way. But did Clarke have to play Lou as such an overbearing smileypuss? The only real acting in this movie comes from Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Wills aggrieved parents. They bring some ballast to this blubberfest. Grade C (Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and some suggestive material.)

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on June 03 2016 at 820 AM comments ""Lips that taste of tears they say"" wrote Dorothy Parker ""are the best for kissing."" Or so that poor melancholy wit desperately hoped. Still her sadly personal observation holds true for cinema as well. We may say we want happily-ever-after movies. Certainly thats what most studios provide. But think about the romances that move beyond easy embraces from classics like ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Now Voyager"" to millennial flicks like ""The Fault in Our Stars"" and ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl."" Many many salty kisses. Not a lot of happy endings. So now comes ""Me Before You."" And really no spoiler alerts necessary. Adapted from a best-selling novel about a pretty home health aide and a handsome millionaire with quadriplegia you know right off this isnt a standard rom-com. If only the filmmakers knew that too. ""Me Before You"" though plays things way too happy and a little too sappy. Determined to put a cheerful face on everything it takes the easiest way out mostly in the casting and direction of its heroine Louisa Clark. Given her grim duties on ""Game of Thrones"" (and the even grimmer reception given her ""Terminator Genisys"" adventure) its understandable that Emilia Clarke would enthusiastically sign up for this bright lively and flashy part. But Clark is so overwritten and Clarke so underdirected that she explodes in a flurry of eccentric quirks. Her wardrobe looks like a bomb went off in Cyndi Laupers closet. Her facial expressions are stuck somewhere between mugging madwoman and a mangy Muppet. But then Clarks not supposed to be a real person. Shes that new Hollywood cliche the manic pixie dream girl - or in this case the manic pixie nursemaid - here solely to pull the hero out of his (quite understandable) funk. Give the story credit (adapted here by the original novelist Jojo Moyes) for knowing that a suicidal young man with a severe disability needs more than a madcap girl and a cup of tea to set him right. At least ""Me Before You"" doesnt turn him into a grinning Romeo overnight. And director Thea Sharrock - best known for her classical-theater work -- has brought in sharp veterans Janet McTeer and Charles Dance to play Wills parents and Stephen Peacocke to play Nathan Wills hunky physical therapist. (Theres also a welcome cameo by Joanna Lumley as a tart-tongued gossip.) But Will is played by dull Sam Claflin (Finnick from the ""Hunger Games"" franchise) and he remains handsomely unmemorable. And while the film lingers on pretty Welsh backdrops the story takes a lot of cowardly shortcuts particularly when it comes to the hard facts of rich young Wills injuries. MORE A few words with Emilia Clarke Nathan takes care of all of the messy physical needs; we never see any scars or scary details and although Will and Clark share a few cuddles and kisses exactly what sexual function Will has left is decorously left very vague. The true physical challenges - and specific pleasures - of this relationship are deliberately left offscreen. No this is not ""Breaking the Waves"" nor even ""Coming Home"" nor should it have to be. But keeping any reality out of this love story does audiences - and people with handicaps - no favors. After all kisses do sometimes need to be flavored with a few tears. And romances - even big best-selling ones - are sweetest when theres a slightly bitter touch of real life. Ratings note The film contains strong language. Me Before You (PG-13) Warner Bros. (110 min.) Directed by Thea Sharrock. With Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin. Now playing in New Jersey.   Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com. Follow him on Twitter stephenwhitty.

Entertainment via AP) REVIEW Me Before You is a schmaltzy and offensive depiction of disability Add to ... JULIA COOPER Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jun. 03 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jun. 03 2016 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Thea Sharrock Written by Jojo Moyes Starring Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin Janet McTeer Classification PG Genre romance Year 2016 Country USA Language English Lou (Emilia Clarke) enters the sleek newly converted wing of an English castle where she will begin her first day as a caregiver to a man living with a disability (Sam ""Finnick from The Hunger Games"" Claflin as Will). She stops abruptly. Her toothy smile collapses on her face and her widening eyes betray terror. Just before meeting Will - an angry quadriplegic living with his upper-class parents in a small British town - Lou spies the toilet. It has been adapted to accommodate Will with a tall plastic back and armrests. Gape-mouthed and horrified at the thought of a disabled man needing to poop This is the heroine of Thea Sharrocks schmaltzy and offensive Me Before You (unfortunately opening this Friday). This film cost 20-million to make and at its heart is a glossy live-action Beauty and the Beast with a quadriplegic in the role of non-human animal. The film is adapted from Jojo Moyess 2012 bestselling ""romance"" novel and goes like this Will who had been living a posh life in London stripping assets for a living and chasing adrenalin highs gets in an accident and would rather die than live in the new iteration of his body.Along comes bright-eyed and bushy-tailed Lou who has no experience of caregiving but is a chipper antidote to Wills misery. He treats her like shes an idiot and makes fun of her quirky fashion sense all of which the film wants to suggest is because his disability makes him a cantankerous grump. Its more likely that his misogyny is a product of being a rich narcissist left wanting for nothing but hey isnt love strange?There are so few empathetic depictions onscreen of people whose bodies are different than what we call normal. This film is a squandered chance to illuminate the ways in which bodies function differently but feelings like ardour and lust are universal. Instead Me Before You is clearly disgusted by the needs of the quadriplegic body and Wills disability is aestheticized. It is as though the film itself is swaddled in soft cashmere.Through dialogue we hear that Wills pain and suffering is gruesome so debilitating that questions of suicide and assisted dying lie not far outside of the shot. And yet we see none of this ""ugly"" stuff. Wills insistence that his is not really a life worth living reads then as a cold and insidious insistence that in fact it is the disabled life that is not worth living.By contrast we can look to Hanya Yanagiharas 2015 novel A Little Life for a complex and affecting narrative of living with and through pain. Without shirking contentious questions of suicide and trauma it offers a better love story too.Clarke - already familiar to many as Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones - does her best to lift up the role of Lou. Shes got the comedic timing of a young Bridget Jones and there is something soothing in her lack of ambition. Shes working this caregiving job to support her underemployed family and is happy enough to do so but Will insists that Lou must live more boldly. Despite the fact that Lou is content with her life and her close-knit family bonds Will is certain that she is squandering her potential. This is where the films commentary on class divisions in England rears its righteous head and implies that Wills family is wealthy not because of any privilege but rather because they worked hard fuelled by a hungry ambition that Lous family just cant muster.Me Before You builds its melodrama so intensely that the films end is almost sure to make you cry. But dont let that trick you into thinking that the movie is good simply because it is affecting thats precisely the function of melodrama. And so despite its 20-million budget Me Before You is cheap; and just like a person who has more money than he knows what to do with this film equates wealth with value and vulnerability with death.

Pictures)Emilia Clarke gives a luminous buoyant performance in ""Me Before You"" lighting up the screen like a spotlight is following her every move.Clarke plays Louisa Clark a bubbly ultra-optimist who signs on to be a caregiver to Will Traynor (Sam Claflin magnetic) a well-to-do playboy who winds up a quadriplegic after a motorcycle accident.Traynor plans to end his life through an assisted suicide facility in Switzerland but Clark aims to give him a reason to live. Their relationship slowly blossoms but Jojo Moyes screenplay -- adapted from her own massively popular 2012 novel -- avoids cliched romance and disability trappings at every turn.And while this could easily wither into movie-of-the-week material director Thea Sharrock brings humanity truth and heart to the screen. By the time it becomes a first-class weepie its tears are earned.The third main character in the film is Clarks quirky fashion sense and her frilly sweaters colorful skirts playful leggings and marvelous footwear beam with a life of their own.But its Clarke who steals the show.Clarke who plays the Khaleesi on ""Game of Thrones"" stalled in a previous bid at big-screen stardom when last summers ""Terminator Genisys"" was terminated at the box office. But ""Me Before You"" should do the job She is absolutely radiant in the role charming the audience with the same wide-eyed optimism she does Traynor.Clarks sparkle is similar to when Julia Roberts graced the screen in ""Pretty Woman.""

In ""Me Before You"" Daenerys Targaryen from ""Game of Thrones"" is the daughter of Mr. Bates from ""Downton Abbey"" and she falls in love with Finnick Odair from ""The Hunger Games"" whose father is ... Tywin Lannister from ""Game of Thrones."" When Emilia Clarkes character meets Charles Dances character I couldnt help wishing he would say ""The mother of dragons in MY house?"" But that would be a ""Funny or Die"" clip and not a movie and we are here to talk about the movie and alas ""Me Before You"" is nowhere near as entertaining as the television programs and the film referenced above. Based on a beloved and bestselling novel and doing everything to make you cry short of flooding theaters with the overwhelming scent of onions ""Me Before You"" is a beautifully filmed and well-intentioned weeper marred by an unfortunate performance from one of the leads and a plot development that leaves us more angry and frustrated than moved in the final act. Emilia Clarke from ""Game of Thrones"" floors the gas pedal on Self-Consciously Adorable as Louisa aka ""Lou"" a painfully simple working-class girl in her mid-20s who dresses like a 7-year-old pretending to be a grown-up furrows her considerable eyebrows so frequently and so aggressively were afraid they might just leave her face and maintains the cheerful demeanor of a princess-to-be in a Disney cartoon. Sam Claflins Will had it all -- the looks the charm the great job the moneyed background (he grew up in an actual castle) the beautiful girlfriend -- until the rainy morning when he was yapping on his cell phone and he walked right into the path of a motorcycle and now hes a quadriplegic living on the grounds of his parents estate alienating one caregiver after another blasting metal music in his room and hating every second of his existence. Enter Lou as Wills latest caregiver and here come the plot references to ""My Fair Lady"" ""Educating Rita"" ""The Bucket List"" ""Pretty Woman"" (Lou even wears a red dress to a musical performance ala Julia Roberts) and even ""Dying Young"" (in which Ms. Roberts played a caregiver to a wealthy patient played by Campbell Scott). Will is rude to the point of cruelty. Lou keeps coming at him with flowers and enthusiasm and suggestions for fun activities they can do. Wills loving parents (Charles Dance and Janet McTeer) pace about their enormous home in their tasteful rich peoples clothes arguing about what to do about Wills state of mind. The soundtrack is peppered with songs containing lyrics almost literally describing what just transpired as we transition to the next scene. At one point Lou notices scars on Wills wrists indicating a suicide attempt. Am I wrong to wonder how a quadriplegic cut his own wrists? Did someone help him? Bigger problems with ""Me Before You"" include Lous boorish wet blanket of a boyfriend a self-absorbed clown who makes it REALLY easy for Lou to turn her eyes to Will. Also scenes in which the audience at a concert and the guests at a wedding reception are horrified by the mere presence of a man in a wheelchair seem way way over the top. Yes differently abled individuals must deal with ignorant reactions from some people. But in ""Me Before You"" the elite and the privileged stare at Will as if they have never seen anyone in a wheelchair and they cant believe he has the nerve to join them in society. And then theres Will himself. Granted its beyond our comprehension to fully understand what it must be like to be in the best of health one day and then unable to walk or move ones arms the next. Its a tragedy. Yet Will is in a situation that would be the envy of 99.9 percent of quadriplegic. The decisions he makes are more infuriating than debate-provoking more selfish than the selflessness with which theyre portrayed in the film. As tearjerkers go this one features a guy whos something of a jerk.  New Line Cinema and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures present a film directed by Thea Sharrock and written by JoJo Moyes based on her book. Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for thematic elements and some suggestive material). Opens Friday at local theaters.

Comments click to enlarge Me Before You Video Rated PG-13  110 minutes  2016 Adapted by Jojo Moyes from her own novel this juvenile romance stars Emilia Clarke (HBOs Game of Thrones) as a sunny working-class girl who becomes a professional caregiver and Sam Claflin (The Hunger Games) as the quadriplegic aristocrat who becomes her charge and eventually her Byronic lover. With her comically loud outfits and mile-wide grin Clarke overemotes so feverishly that she sometimes suggests a silent-movie gamine though eventually the mounting drama absorbs her outsize performance. I cant recommend this movie to anyone older than high school age but French-cinema fans might want to check out the laughably incongruous scene in which Claflin persuades Clarke to watch Of Gods and Men Xavier Beauvoiss harrowing metaphysical drama about a group of martyred Franciscan monks.

O. SCOTTJUNE 2 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin in ""Me Before You."" Credit Warner Bros. A recent screening of ""Me Before You"" concluded with audible sniffles and even a sob or two. Why not gales of laughter or quiet snores? These are the mysteries that trouble a critics uneasy mind. This floppy British romance directed by Thea Sharrock and adapted by Jojo Moyes from her best-selling novel sits at the point where tedium ridiculousness and heartfelt sentiment converge separated by an all-but-imperceptible distance. You cant really argue with someone elses tears. You can however find yourself mystified by them.Which is not to say that there is anything especially hard to figure out about this movie. On the contrary It makes a virtue of its absolute obviousness. The first time we see Louisa Clark -- known as Lou and played by Emilia Clarke -- we note her brightly colored tights and surmise that she is a quirky free spirit. And she is In contrast Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) is imperious and sarcastic both because he is an aristocrat (in an actual castle) and because an accident has left him mostly paralyzed from the neck down.Lou having been laid off from a job dispensing bogus nutritional advice to old ladies at a tea shop is hired by Wills mother (Janet McTeer) to care for him. ""Not the physical stuff"" Lou is assured. Those duties are taken care of by an affable Australian (Stephen Peacocke). Lous assignment is to be cheery and pleasant. To keep Will company and interrupt his brooding with chipper chattiness. To annoy him until he falls in love with her. Video Movie Review Me Before You The Times critic A. O. Scott reviews ""Me Before You."" By AINARA TIEFENTHALER on Publish Date June 2 2016. Photo by Alex Bailey/Warner Brothers. His part of the bargain is to soften in her presence and to introduce her to sophisticated pleasures like Mozart and movies with subtitles. Lou already has a boyfriend a self-centered fitness nut named Patrick (Matthew Lewis) but as soon as you see him you will know better than to expect a werewolf-versus-vampire rivalry for a young womans affections. This is not ""Twilight.""But ""Me Before You"" does live in the same ""Twilight""-fan-fiction neighborhood as ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" though without the spanking or the atrocious dialogue. (Not that the dialogue here is any good. Its just not especially memorable one way or the other.) The operative fantasy is of an ingenue who seduces and is seduced by a man who is rich powerful and also helpless in need of rescuing by the heroine even as she finds herself in his thrall.The ending of this movie though which I suppose Im honor-bound not to spoil is another matter altogether. It will be described in some quarters as tragic but this doesnt seem quite right. For one thing there has not been enough genuine dramatic conflict to give sad events the full cathartic weight of tragedy. For another the conclusion might not really be sad at all. Lou gets a lot of money and a fresh croissant. So maybe I had it all wrong and those tears were tears of joy.

Me Before You plays it safe review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies Me Before You plays it safe review Me Before You keeps things superficial with this three-hankie weeper. By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. June 2 2016Me Before YouStarring Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin Janet McTeer and Charles Dance. Directed by Thea Sharrock. 110 minutes. Opens Friday at major theatres. PGA Cinderella story right down to the prince the castle and the fancy shoes Me Before You keeps things simple and superficial considering that much of the plot turns on the thorny (and certainly topical) issue of medically assisted suicide.After endearingly goofy Lou (Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke) loses her job she decides to try her hand at being a hired companion to wealthy Will Traynor (The Hunger Games Sam Claflin) a handsome London hotshot now quadriplegic after an accident. The abrupt change in his life has made Will bitter and angry and since he sees no point in continuing this way hes made an appointment some months hence at a Swiss clinic to end his life.Article Continued BelowThis information is hardly a spoiler -- its evident where things are headed in the trailer. And it presents the biggest sticking point of the film the frankly offensive idea that death is preferable to life a wheelchair. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin get to know each other in Me Before You.  (MGM)  Claflin gives the better performance of the two leads with Clarke tending to overplay the quirks and sunny smiles of the working-class Lou although she delivers a spot-on speech about marriage that is somewhat redemptive.Lou mucks in with plenty of cheery chin-up attitude echoed in her eclectic wardrobe (those shoes) and is only temporarily blue when Will ices her out. If only she could somehow inspire the morose guy in the wheelchair to embrace life again.Naturally theres romance ahead as these two opposites find a common attraction (signalled by a shave and a haircut for Will) and its tough not to get caught up in the genuine tenderness Lou and Will seem to share. Some risk-taking could have nudged Me Before You beyond its The Fault in Our Stars sensibilities but screenwriter Jojo Moyes (who also wrote the bestseller) and director Thea Sharrock play it safe never breaking from the PG template for their tear-jerker. Not everyone will be rooting around for a fresh supply of tissues.Theres solid supporting work from Janet McTeer as Wills reserved mother and look for a fun cameo from a titan of classic British comedy TV plus Brendan Coyle (Mr. Bates from Downton Abbey) as Lous down-on-his-luck dad.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures MOVIE REVIEW ME BEFORE YOU Running time 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 (tasteful references to sexuality and assisted suicide). Imagine ""Pretty Woman"" if the main character wasnt a top-dollar prostitute but instead an impoverished eccentrically dressed knockout hired to cheer up a handsome paraplegic multimillionaire. Thats how ""Me Before You"" starts out -- with winning performances by ""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke and ""Hunger Games"" veteran Sam Claflin that are better than youd expect from the mawkish trailer. Unfortunately this ultra-glossy romantic drama derived from a best seller twists into very dark territory -- a drastic tonal shift that neither its stars nor debuting director Thea Sharrock a respected stage veteran manage with dramatic credibility. Doffing her blond ""Thrones"" wig for her naturally brunette hair and dressed in eyeball-gougingly ugly outfits Clarke plays the high-spirited Louisa who lives in a small English village where shes her familys sole support. When shes laid off from her job at a tea shop Lou (as she is known) obtains a well-paying position as chief morale officer for Claflins William who has become an embittered recluse since losing all mobility and feeling below his neck in an accident two years earlier. Lou cheerfully endures hostility and coldness from William at first but theres no serious doubt her smile will defrost her new employer who lives in a specially equipped wing of the family castle. Jojo Moyes adaptation of her own novel gives Clarke opportunities to shine as this faux ugly duckling (who somehow fishes a red designer gown out of her closet for her first outing with William) especially when she is briefly forced to take on added responsibilities when his actual caretaker is unavailable during one of Williams medical crises. Claflin (he and Clarke have great chemistry) adds dimension to what could have been a two-note role poignantly reacting to an announcement by his ex-girlfriend and his best friend that theyre getting married. Whats shaping up as sort of disability porn then throws some mighty cold water on Lou and Williams getting-to-love-you montages. (You might want to stop reading here if you want to avoid spoilers.) It turns out that even before Lou was hired William made a deal with his heartbroken parents (beautifully portrayed by Charles Dance and Janet McTeer). On an appointed day in the near future they will take him to what looks suspiciously like a high-end spa in Switzerland for an assisted suicide that William craves because he just cant face a life unlike the one as a swashbuckling financier that he had before the accident. Some advocates for the disabled are rightly outraged at the suggestion that even a wealthy handsome man in an (admittedly limited) relationship with a beautiful woman would prefer death to living with a disability. The three-hankie ""Me Before You"" seems less interested in Williams anguish than in whether Lou can change his mind -- or whether she will just have to settle for a generous bequest.

So it is unashamedly the kind of movie that our mothers used to enjoy in years past with a box of tissues at the ready. The beauty of this British opus is that everyone involved seems to be proud of its embrace of emotion romance and naivete. The movie does not just wade into a sea of sentimental material it dives in headfirst. This is refreshing. Few filmmakers dare to do this in the new millennium. The enthusiasts include the star performer Emilia Clarke of Game of Thrones fame. Clarke has already acknowledged that in contrast to her thoughts on her distance from her warrior princess Daenerys Targaryen in the fantasy Game of Thrones she feels a deep connection to the story and her role in Me Before You. In a beautifully wrought performance that roots her character in reality Clarke plays Louisa Clark a happy-go-lucky small-town English girl. Soon after we meet her Lou is hired as a caregiver by the richest people in town (played with grace by Janet McTeer and Charles Dance). Their son (Sam Claflin from The Hunger Games) is the aristocratic heir to their fortune and even their castle. But Claflins Will Traynor is now paralyzed from the neck down after a horrific accident. And he would prefer to die rather than remain in this state. Clarkes Lou tasks herself to changing his mind. Me Before You is based on the bestselling novel of the same name from English author Jojo Moyes who was enlisted to adapt her own book to the screen. As a result fans of the 2012 novel which sold six million copies can be comfortable knowing that changes were done in collaboration with the original writer. Critically for the character the heroines flashy thrift-store wardrobe is intact Me Before You was directed by a first-timer in features. But Englands Thea Sharrock is no neophyte. She has extensive experience in British theatre at a high level. In television she directed Tom Hiddleston in a well-regarded version of Shakespeares Henry V for the BBC/PBS series The Hollow Crown. Overlooking her one awkward misstep -- Clarkes Lou gushes out her already obvious motivations for livening up Will Traynors routine -- Sharrock is deft in giving us access to the central crisis. Some viewers may find the movie awkward in other ways however. Moyes novel walked a fine edge in regards to quality-of-life issues for people with physical challenges. So does the movie. Me Before You does not choose a path all should follow; instead it chronicles how these particular characters deal with their challenges. Not everyone will agree with the choices they make. For those who go with the movies flow Claflins performance is as strong as Clarkes. He brings a wicked wit that matches up with Clarkes breezy humour. Claflin also never minimizes what it must be like for an individual to lose so much while in the prime of life. So his characters choices never seem trivial or trite. Meanwhile the movie is handsomely filmed including on location at Pembroke Castle in Wales. Support performers are excellent including Brendan Coyle (from Downton Abbey) as Lous dad and Steve Peacocke as the Aussie therapist. On the emotional level spirits are high even when tragedy is at hand thanks to the boundless humour woven into the story. And yes Me Before You will jerks some tears maybe even from cynics.

USA TODAYSam Claflin and Emilia Clarke star in Me Before You.(Photo Alex Bailey)For those naturally prone to the movie cry -- the kind that leaves you in a weepy mess after The Notebook Love Story et al. -- crocodile tears await in the romantic drama Me Before You.But youre not a cold-hearted snake if they dont come. Because emotionally manipulative and melodramatic as it is Me Before You (1/2  out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters nationwide Friday) doesnt strike as concrete a bond as it should between a gruff yet hunky quadriplegic Will (Sam Claflin) and his quirky and loving caregiver Lou (Emilia Clarke).In their small English town shes a good-hearted sort whose flightiness doesnt help on the job front. After getting sacked from her bakery job and put on a financial guilt trip by her working-class dad (Brendan Coyle of Downton Abbey fame) Lou takes a flyer on a gig at the local castle to help out Will.USA TODAYEmilia Clarke Sam Claflin grapple with love life in Me Before YouOnce a banker on the rise he was left paralyzed after a motorcycle accident two years prior. Lou is hired mainly to be his friend though she has her work cut out for her since hes mentally prepared for an assisted suicide and tends to be cruel to anyone in range of his caustic wit. That doesnt deter the smiley positive-thinking Lou who puts together a list of things he needs to do before meeting his fate. Feelings grow between the two a shock to only those who just watch action films.Lou (Emilia Clarke left) and her sister (Jenna Coleman) hang out in Me Before You. (Photo Alex Bailey)Not one but two Ed Sheeran songs and some seriously milquetoast musical fare get audiences primed for the torrent of emotions to come though at least director Thea Sharrock doesnt go full Nicholas Sparks in her first feature film There is a rainstorm there is a kiss but no one gets soaking wet.Best known for being a no-nonsense dragon queen on Game of Thrones Clarke does well going the complete opposite way as the oddball Lou. The character flirts with being a young Bridget Jones type at first and wears an infinite number of butterfly-adorned clothes and weird legwear but Clarke shines as the insecure softie who winds up made of sterner stuff.USA TODAYMe Before You stars on pranks Thrones spoilersClaflins Will meanwhile goes from mountain-man beard to clean-shaven square jaw and that follicular journey matches his arc of absolute jerk to caring dude. Solid in the role he and Clarke do have some chemistry together but nothing thats bound to leave you wrecked one way or another by the end.Jojo Moyes adapted her own best-selling book which helps give Me Before You a singular inviting vibe instead of feeling like The Fault in Our Stars 2. That said she leans hard into her messaging -- ""Live boldly"" and ""Dont settle"" arent so much words to live by as mantras forcibly hashtagged onto your brain. Or your hankie. 253 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1sPxT94",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/06/02/review-me-before-you-movie/85263964/,200,mebeforeyou17,mebeforeyou,usatoday

Lugubrious tearjerkers lapped up by drooling female readers have proven to be quite a profitable cottage industry. Nicholas Sparks has become a multi-millionaire by writing 18 American romance novels that refuse to underestimate the ignorance and innocence of those gullible readers includingThe Notebook Dear John and Message in a Bottle. Critics hate him and he cries all the way to the bank. Following in his footsteps there is now Englands Jojo Moyes a girl who is catching up fast. Her tearjerker Me Before You has made it to the big screen with mountains of Kleenex to spare. Forgive me if I temporarily shelve my customary cynicism in favor of commerce. A first film by theatre director Thea Sharrock it goes down smooth as sherry. ME BEFORE YOU  (3/4 stars) Written by Jojo Moyes Directed by Thea Sharrock Starring Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin and Janet McTeer Running time 110 min. The films appeal is due largely to the charisma of its two leads Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke. Hes the impossibly handsome young actor who played Finnick Odair in the Hunger Games series as well as roles in one of the ghastly Pirates of the Caribbean clones. Shes a regular on the overrated TV series Game of Thrones. In real roles they easily prove theyre both better than the junk theyve been assigned so far. In the opening setup hes Will Traynor the privileged well-educated son of a rich aristocratic family who is making waves as a dashing banker and scheduled to marry his dream girl in a country wedding that dominates the society pages. Shes Lou Clark a poor girl who works as a waitress in a bake shop that suddenly goes belly up leaving her searching for a new job to help out with her familys badly needed income. Suddenly as things often happen in romance novels the page turns when Will preoccupied on his cellphone steps off a curb and gets slammed by a speeding motorcycle in an accident that dashes his hopes wrecks his future and turns him into a bitter depressed and joyless paraplegic. His spinal injury also leaves him vulnerable to infections and confined to a wheelchair--a predicament he vows he will end with suicide. Without experience but loaded with personality Lou is hired by his distraught mother (the great Janet McTeer) to spend each day in the Traynor family castle and become Wills companion and nurse. Resistant to her chatty ebullience Will is turned off by this annoying extrovert but is nevertheless amused by her outrageous costumes faux pas and classic screw-ups. Their class differences are obvious but eventually of course as their relationship grows he loosens up warms to her silliness and learns to laugh. By the time Will melts in the glow of Lous charm and devotion an unlikely duo has found true love. The conflict comes when they go away on a beach holiday in Majorca and Will is forced to decide if hes man enough to overcome his paralysis and marry Lou or make good on his threats of going to a beatific clinic in Switzerland where suicide is legal and he can end his misery? Will Lou save him or does Will carry out his threat leaving everyone in the film dissolved in tears? No spoilers but get ready to feel devastated disappointed or uplifted by the theme that ""Living boldly with love and courage is better than not living at all."" If he doesnt succumb to easy money and Hollywood blockbuster trash Mr. Claflin is headed for a major career as a leading man. He even smiles in Technicolor. Ms. Clarke sparkles but she plays every mood shift from sadness to joy with a cheerful exuberance that grows exhausting. Shes a symphony of facial tics wide-open grins and a picket-fence smile that is gooier than Julia Roberts. She even acts with her eyebrows. Me Before You is not without punishment but its so well made that it survives every drawback. I guess I was in just the right emotional frame of mind the day I saw it but what the hey; a little occasional unrequited love on the screen never hurt anybody including a critic.

Just get a load of Me Before You. I watched the film version of Jojo Moyes 2012 bestseller surrounded by women who laughed through their tears and vice versa. The few dudes in attendance sat stoically resigned to their fate or maybe holding back their feelings. Surprise Me Before You isnt an unduly painful endurance test.

Emilia Clarke is best known as the blond dragon-taming Khaleesi on Game of Thrones. But here she plays brunette plain-Jane Louisa ""Lou"" Clark from a rowdy working-class British family. Lou becomes the caretaker for blue-blood quadriplegic Will Traynor played with winning charm by Sam Claflin of The Hunger Games franchise. Will is an impossibly handsome London financier who was paralyzed two years ago when a motorcycle accident ended a lifestyle that would have qualified him for the best season ever of The Bachelor. His wealthy family owns the British castle right over the hill from Lous humble abode. Chatty dimpled Lou whose wardrobe of Minnie Mouse stripes and polka dots would send fashionistas into a shock coma is improbably hired by Wills mum (Janet McTeer restrained and remarkable) to distract her son from offing himself at an assisted-suicide clinic in Switzerland. Not since Julia Roberts tried to smile Campbell Scott back to life in 1991s dismal Dying Young has an actress had to grin like a maniacal cartoon character in the face of the Grim Reaper. Yet Clarke pulls it off exuding natural warmth and humor in a part constructed from artificial sweeteners. OK she could have twinkled less. But the actress is genuinely endearing as is the admirably dry-eyed and acid-tongued Claflin. He teaches Lou about Mozart and subtitled movies and admits to a weakness for Michael Bays Armageddon (he lost me there). Will thinks Lous clothes are ridiculous but falls -- as he must -- for the real her. A few moments allow both actors to register strongly. Im thinking of a scene in which Will whirls Lou around a dance floor in his wheelchair. Peering at her neckline he says ""you wouldnt let me near those breasts if I wasnt in this chair."" The two share a few PG-13 kisses as Lou tries to show Will the possibilities in  choosing life. But the movie keeps averting its eyes when things get uncomfortable about the tangle of sex and frustration. Like the book by Moyes who wrote the script the film glosses over suffering with beauty. The messier duties of caring for Will are handled by male nurse Nathan (Stephen Peacocke) also a looker. Everyone is gorgeous and impossible not to love. If I seem taken aback by what is really no more than typical Hollywood twaddle its because Me Before You is the feature film debut of Thea Sharrock a leading light in the British theater and the last person youd expect to go mucking around in paint-by-numbers tearjerking. A leading U.S. Disability Organization has criticized the film for implying that the millions of people with significant disabilities currently leading fulfilling rich lives might be better off committing suicide. I dont think Me Before You does that. But it also doesnt grapple  deeply enough with the core questions it raises settling for telling a sob story that will go down easy at the box office. Still you cant blame audiences too much for being seduced by two shining young stars in a movie romance that hits the spot bitter and sweet.

Entertainment shows Emilia Clarke in a scene from ""Me Before You."" (Alex Bailey/Warner Bros. Entertainment via AP) Review Me Before You evokes tears but lacks depth Wednesday June 1 2016 0902 PM By JOCELYN NOVECK AP National Writer Well I cried anyway. I cried even though halfway through ""Me Before You"" I swore to myself I wouldnt because the movie felt overly broad overly simplistic lacking depth both in characterization and in treatment of the serious issues it raises. At the end I still thought all those things ... but the tears came anyway. It seems that some movies -- particularly those featuring young passionate suffering people -- are destined to get the waterworks going no matter how well (or not) they tell their story. That story is already known of course to fans of the novel by Jojo Moyes who adapted her book here. Like the (better) 2014 tearjerker ""The Fault in Our Stars"" this film version directed by Thea Sharrock probably is a slam dunk for the books fans who will likely be crying from the first scene. For the rest of us its a bit of a harder sell. Certainly the couple at the center of the heartbreak is appealing; both Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") and Sam Claflin (""The Hunger Games"") have beautiful smiles. But especially in the case of Clarke that smile -- a very wide one -- is relied upon way too much with the camera often lingering for long seconds during which we could actually have been say learning something more about her character. Clarke plays Louisa an amiable cafe waitress in an English town. We meet her on the day she loses her job throwing her struggling extended family into turmoil. Louisa -- or Lou as shes called -- has few skills but manages to get an interview at the grand Traynor estate. It turns out the job entails caring for the son of the family Will. Weve met Will in the prologue; he was a dashing supremely handsome London banker with a taste for extreme sports when one day he left home (and his sexy blonde girlfriend) and was hit by a motorcycle paralyzing him from the neck down. After a brief interview with Wills mother (the excellent Janet McTeer) Lou gets the job. Her task will be to provide cheer since Wills medical needs are already tended to by a nurse (though the movie shows hardly any of this). But Will is bitter and mostly silent. He first greets Lou with a naughty ""My Left Foot"" impression then proceeds to either ignore her or toss barbs about her whimsically wacky wardrobe which includes leprechaun shoes (a trait of Lous that is cute until it gets annoying.) But Lou is determined and soon enough (too soon dramatically speaking) Will is submitting to the warmth of her smile. He introduces her to films with subtitles. She gets him to come outside in the sun. She takes him to the horse races. She even gets him to attend a fancy concert; like Julia Roberts at the opera in ""Pretty Woman"" its her first such experience and she cries. (Also like Roberts she wears a glamorous red dress.) Will attends Lous family birthday dinner. He even asks her to join him at the wedding of the former girlfriend who left him (it remains unexamined why Will would want to make this journey.) There love seems to bloom between the two. But Lou also discovers a truth that horrifies her Will has been exploring the possibility of assisted suicide for months. Devastated Lou resolves to show him that life is worth living. She brings him on an idyllic beach holiday. The choice Will ultimately makes wont be revealed here. The movie has been criticized by some in the disabled community for suggesting in their view that death might be better than life as a quadriplegic. In any case the filmmakers seem to have missed an opportunity to deal in a sophisticated way with a thorny important subject. Still youll probably cry anyway. Its that kind of film. ""Me Before You"" a Warner Bros. release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""thematic elements and some suggestive material."" Running time 110 minutes. Two stars out of four. MPAA definition of PG-13 Parents strongly cautioned. Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Emilia Clarke does a lot of eyebrow acting in Me Before You. As Louisa Clark a whimsically dressed young woman who accepts a job as caretaker of a quadriplegic young man to help with her familys dire finances Clarke is a fair distance away from dragons or Terminators. To convey her open-hearted high-spirited pluck she raises her eyebrows until theyre practically smashed together pushing them up and down her forehead to oscillate between manic delight and abashed squirms. Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) the quadriplegic young man regards her with the sardonic composure of someone secretly falling in love.These are not good performances exactly. Clarke is endearing but verges on mugging. Claflin is at his best when Will gives in to his competitive urges which happens exactly once. While at dinner with Louisas family and ridiculously one-note obstacle of a boyfriend Patrick (Matthew Lewis) who neglects her in favor of obsessive exercise Claflin displays a flash of the charming smarm he employed as Finnick Odair in the Hunger Games movies. The rest of the time Will mostly either broods or smiles sardonically as Clarke looks frazzled then surprised then frazzled again.But Clarke and Claflin still command attention not just because there are few characters in Me Before You and fewer with any depth. The movie holds so little visual interest than its leads faces are almost the entire show. Director Thea Sharrock manages exactly one strikingly beautiful shot The camera stays fixed on a close-up of Louisa and Will as they go for a dance-floor spin in his wheelchair her sitting on his lap the rest of the party spinning in a blur behind them.That a weepy romance should depend heavily on its stars is not a surprise. But it also depends on those stars playing characters who make a convincing engaging potential couple. These two feel more like a computer match complementing each other technically but not practically. Louisa is eternally optimistic but has been limited in her options by her familys financial situation necessitating that she stay in her hometown and contribute. Will feels robbed of his earlier vitality--he was injured two years ago in an accident hastily dramatized in the films opening scene--but perks up enough to nudge Louisa in the direction of subtitled films and Mozart concerts. This is supposed to be romantic but it seems like Will is clearing a very low bar set by Patrick--or more accurately by the filmmakers (including screenwriter Jojo Moyes adapting her own novel) who cant conceive of a single moment where Patrick is more than mildly polite to Louisa but expect the audience to buy him as her boyfriend of seven years. Wills slight condescension only looks attractive by comparison.The movie also reveals relatively early that Will is seriously considering an assisted-suicide procedure and has agreed to think on it for six months to appease his posh stricken parents (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance). This plot point has angered some disability activists but if they just sit down and watch the movie they might get bored and fall asleep. If they were still outraged upon waking it would be frankly kind of understandable. The movie deserves some credit for not demonizing assisted suicide but makes Will so unyielding that both the issue and the character become static. Its not an uncommon quality in a real life but it doesnt make for much of a movie. Me Before You is a first-level tearjerker the kind that expects people to cry when the characters are sad not because of any unspoken meaning underneath. It just goes through the motions and pipes in contemplative music because thats what these movies do.

(Photo Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.)Director Thea Sharrocks film based on the bestseller by Jojo Moyes (who also wrote the screenplay) is handsomely made with beautiful people doing inspirational things in the face of struggle that kind of thing. But the plot is filled with cliches and the attempt at the bigger picture -- the value of a life -- is muddy at best.

(Photo Alex Bailey)Thats how she lands at the mansion of the ultra-rich Traynor family whose son Will (Sam Claflin) is paralyzed from the shoulders down after a motorcycle hits him. Will enjoyed the life money offered taking part in all kinds of adventures and extreme sports. Now he cannot leave his chair and has a physical therapist Nathan (Stephen Peacocke) who tends to his physical needs.

Me Before You a three-hankie dose of charm and waterworks Some tearjerkers are briskly effective at getting the waterworks going though not in a way thats lastingly cathartic. Me Before You-adapted by Jojo Moyes from her enormously popular novel and directed by first-timer Thea Sharrock-is that kind of picture a harmless enough entry in the ""adorable mite tames surly masculine beast"" romantic-weeper genre hitting all the right beats with the clink of an expertly struck cowbell. Game of Thrones Emilia Clarke looking and sounding less like a mother of dragons than the kind of winsome cartoon mouse who uses a polka-dot toadstool for an umbrella plays Lou a young Englishwoman who has deferred her dreams of going to college-she needs to work to keep her family afloat. In desperation she takes a job as caretaker to a man who has recently been paralyzed in an accident. William (The Hunger Games Sam Claflin) used to be one of those guys who would ""live life to the fullest"" which in the movies terms means doing manly-man rich-dude-at-leisure things like performing daredevil waterskiing feats and diving off impossibly high cliffs into the surf below. Now stuck in a wheelchair and essentially a prisoner in the family castle William is sour and miserable and wishes to die. Until Lou comes skipping down the lane. At first William resists her sunny disposition and wardrobe of sweaters adorned with hearts. But her charm assault is formidable and its not long before this former crosspatch is bestowing kooky gifts like whimsical bumblebee legwear upon his lady love. In terms of bending men to her will Lou may not be so far off from Khaleesi after all. If you can tolerate this much cuteness Clarke and Claflin may grow on you-their banter becomes less adorably unbearable as the film goes on. And the bittersweet ending of Me Before You may make you cry even if an hour later you may not remember why. Cheerful and efficient this is the stripey tights of melodramas. -S.Z.

EntertainmentMovies Me Before You sweet but no heat Originally published June 2 2016 at 1200 am Updated June 2 2016 at 131 pm Sam Clafin and Emilia Clarke in ""Me Before You."" Movie review of ""Me Before You"" The film adaptation of Jojo Moyes ""Me Before You"" is sweet but its pop soundtrack distracts. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Kate ClarkSeattle Times staff reporter The Princess Leia buns and eclectic outfits Jojo Moyes wrote for Louisa ""Lou"" Clark in her novel ""Me Before You"" dont disappoint on screen. Lou (Emilia Clarke) is decked out in her black-and-white furry striped coat dresses patterned with butterflies and vegetables and a wild collection of brightly colored tights and shoes that resemble the bouquet of multicolored daisies she holds in one scene. Twenty-six-year-old Lou who lives in a picturesque British tourist town becomes a caretaker for Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) a wealthy local 30-something whos paralyzed from the neck down. Wills cynical sense of humor and outright rudeness doesnt faze Lou; soon the two seem to be in love with Lou determined to convince Will (who is contemplating assisted suicide) to keep on living. Unfortunately the story makes it seem as if Will because of his disability has no reason to keep living aside from maybe Lous antics. The screenplay of which Moyes is a co-writer doesnt deviate far from the popular novel. Under Thea Sharrocks direction Clarkes Lou is as adorable clumsy and endearing as her portrayal in the book and Claflins sarcasm provides a few necessary moments of comic relief. Movie Review 1/2   Me Before You with Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin Janet McTeer Charles Dance Matthew Lewis Stephen Peacocke. Directed by Thea Sharrock from a screenplay by Jojo Moyes based on Moyes novel. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and some suggestive material. Several theaters. If youre hoping to leave the theater happy well ... think ""The Fault in Our Stars"" plus 10 years and less chemistry. Overall the film is sweet but often loses impact in its most serious moments by blasting a happy pop soundtrack. Who wants to listen to Ed Sheeran while watching someone contemplate mortality?

"Me Before You review Emilia Clarke deserves better than bad romance - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Me Before You review Emilia Clarke deserves better than bad romance Trailer Me Before You Watch the official trailer for ""Me Before You."" (YouTube/Warner Bros. Pictures) Watch the official trailer for ""Me Before You."" (YouTube/Warner Bros. Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In many cases theres no sound defense for works of fiction that make millions weep. If there were ""The Bridges of Madison County"" and ""Miss Saigon"" would be in some way defensible.This brings us to ""Me Before You"" written by ex-journalist Jojo Moyes. Moyes came to her 2012 romance between a wealthy dashing quadriplegic and his maniacally upbeat caregiver with a confident reasonably witty prose style. In England especially the book turned into a monster of lucrative pathos. Now we have the film version adapted and streamlined by Moyes and directed by stage veteran Thea Sharrock. It stars Emilia Clarke as Louisa ""Lou"" Clark provincial English country girl hired on a six-month contract by the richest family in town to care for the recently paralyzed Will Traynor played by Sam Claflin.When Lou learns of Wills plans to end it all she doubles down to make him realize his life is not over simply because its not what it was. Meantime sheltered blinkered Lou whos dating the most obviously ill-suited boyfriend since the heyday of ""Bridget Joness Diary"" learns so much from Will How to enjoy a foreign language film for example. And what shes missed by never scuba diving off the coast of Mauritius. And what love really means. Various disability support groups have hated this thing from the first long before there was a movie version. (Or a sequel; Moyes followed up ""Me Before You"" with ""After You""). Because Traynor has decided at storys outset to commit suicide in a posh facility in Switzerland at the end of his six-month trial the narratives perceived by many to be a snuff romance novel. It is at that I suppose.MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOURMore critically to the movies overall resistibility Theres a thin crucial line in stories such as these and with protagonists such as Lou between life-affirming positivity and sociopathic exuberance. Clarke is seriously delightful on talk shows sharp and funny. On ""Game of Thrones"" in case you hadnt heard she has become a phenom as Daenerys Targaryen Khaleesi of the Dothraki Mother of Dragons the hostess with the mostest on the ball. The prospect of playing someone like Lou who doesnt deal with dragons or rape or nudity mustve been mighty appealing to Clarke. Shes more than actress enough to handle a role requiring both comic and dramatic chops.So what happened? In ""Me Before You"" Clarkes Lou zooms straight past adorable into the land of needy and pushy and enough already. As Lou and Will warm to each others company the side characters tactfully recede to the background Lous jolly working-class parents (Brendan Coyle and Samantha Spiro); Wills imperious but empathetic mother and father (Janet McTeer and Charles Dance); the strapping physical therapist (Stephen Peacocke) aiding Will Theyre all there for emotional support and conflicting bits of advice. The story belongs to Clarke and Claflin and it plays like ""Pretty Woman"" one scene ""Whose Life is It Anyway?"" the next. Even if you question what ""Me Before You"" says about life as a quadriplegic (i.e. its no life at all) the movie couldve made its argument more persuasively. Clarke has loads of talent but in ""Me Before You"" shes undermined by director Sharrocks technique and an endless slew of overeager reaction shots (Shes clumsy Shes twinkling) exacerbated by editor John Wilson. The romance remains a thing of cinematic emoticons.Maybe itll draw a huge audience but I doubt it.

Will (Sam Claflin) a quadriplegic is shaved by his companion Lou (Emilia Clarke). Despite their class differences a bond between them grows. Photo Alex Bailey Associated Press Me Before You is better than it had to be 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Hes handsome and rich and newly quadriplegic. Shes cute and spunky and totally broke and she takes a job as his companion -- not as his nurse but as someone for him to talk to. Predictably its rough going at the start but then things get better and over the course of a few months they develop a bond etc. You know this story. You know the emotions to expect and probably the order in which theyre presented and yet even so ... ""Me Before You"" is just a little better than it had to be. Its not so much better that it escapes being what it is a sort-of romance liberally sprinkled with moments of corniness and emotional dishonesty. But ultimately when it matters its truthful -- about the people depicted and who they are and what they face. It should be noted however that the movies depiction of disability and of the choices available to people with disabilities have become subjects of controversy within the disabled community and there have even been some protests and campaigns against the film. Solid decent qualities Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") is Lou a working-class girl in small-town England and the movie makes no bones about the fact that were young Will (Sam Claflin) not the victim of a terrible accident he would never have given Lou a second glance. Its actually rather interesting just how uninteresting Lou is. She is genuinely simple and not too bright with no ambition or passion but she has qualities of character -- not remarkable qualities but solid decent qualities that engage our attention. Clarke is entirely charming and winning in the role except for one small but nagging thing. She has too much facial tension as she speaks and it produces a commensurate tension in the audience. This is nothing you might particularly notice on a small screen but its something you cant miss when a face is blown up to 20 or 30 feet. George Clooney had a similar problem when he first started making movies. Hed wag his head as hed done for years on TV but suddenly entire audiences were getting motion sickness. He made the adjustment and went on to glory. If Clarke can just stop scrunching up her face she can do the same. The class aspect is a presence in ""Me Before You"" but not in the heavy-handed (and ultimately sentimental) way that was present in the French film ""Intouchables"" which had a similar story. In this film Lou just hasnt done anything. Shes never been anywhere. She has never even seen a movie with subtitles. And so introducing her to new things -- not for the sake of educating her but simply to show her new pleasures -- becomes a source of mild enjoyment for young Will. Within what seems to be (and mostly is) a sappy romantic frame Sam Claflin is able to do some nice things with Will and the movie ultimately doesnt let him down. He remains from beginning to end an intelligent person utterly realistic about his situation and we always feel that he is thinking -- that even when he is almost amused and almost happy he maintains a certain British refusal to be anything other than realistic. Cringe moments Claflins rigor and Clarkes charm are counterbalanced by cringe moments as when after years of unemployment Lous father (Brendan Coyle) gets a job as a maintenance man and the family goes into a paroxysm of joy. In such moments one gets the sense of the working class as imagined by the upper class the idea that poor people arent just willing and resigned to working hard but theyre absolutely ecstatic about it. Still unlike at least 90 percent of movies ""Me Before You"" gets better as it goes along and thats something. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

(Credit Warner Bros. UK) advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A small-town British woman falls for a wealthy man in a wheelchair.CAST Emilia Clarke Sam ClaflinRATED PG-13 (Suggested sexuality)LENGTH 150BOTTOM LINE As a romantic weepie not bad. As a drama about a disabled man possibly offensive. Hes wealthy handsome and grouchy. Shes working-class adorable and perpetually happy. Theyre the kind of match movies have been making for decades but in ""Me Before You"" they come with a twist Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) once a weekend athlete and daredevil is now a quadriplegic. This too is the kind of medical misfortune that movies like to throw at young lovers whether its cancer in ""The Fault in Our Stars"" or the vaguely defined illness in ""Love Story."" Those films may have been slightly exploitative and hugely manipulative but ""Me Before You"" adapted from Jojo Moyes best-seller borders on insensitive. As a romantic weepie it isnt bad. As a drama about a man with a disability however its potentially offensive. advertisement | advertise on newsday It starts out enjoyably enough introducing us to Emilia Clarke as Louisa Clark a walking ray of sunshine who favors daft little-girl outfits and puts everyone elses needs above her own. Its an unlikely role for the actress who plays the steel-spined Daenerys Targaryen on HBOs ""Game of Thrones"" but her aggressive cuteness is hard to resist. When Louisa is hired to care for Will even he cant keep up his misanthropic facade. Will introduces her to foreign films; she reintroduces him to the pleasures of fresh air and the company of others. PhotosBooks turned into moviesSUMMERS MUST-SEE MOVIES25 big movies out this summerCritics previewThe movies you have to see in 2016 Their budding romance isnt totally unconvincing but ""Me Before You"" paints a very pretty picture of Wills condition. Louisa is told early on that the truly difficult tasks -- anything involving a bathtub or a toilet -- will be handled by Wills aide Nathan (a very good Stephen Peacocke). Thats convenient as is Wills vast wealth. We cant help but wonder whether Louisa noble as she is would be quite so starry-eyed about this man under less attractive circumstances. Capably directed by first-timer Thea Sharrock from Moyes screenplay ""Me Before You"" takes a serious turn in its second half and addresses the fraught issue of assisted suicide. That debate is far too complex for this trivial movie which perhaps unintentionally says some very dismissive and discouraging things about the value of life in a wheelchair. For a movie about love ""Me Before You"" ends up feeling awfully heartless. 4 more love affairsBring plenty of Kleenex if you see ""Me Before You"" the romantic drama about an unemployed woman who becomes caretaker to a man left paralyzed after a motorcycle accident and falls for him. Here are four other films that opened the tear ducts with similar romantic plots. THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIVES (1946) -- Harold Russell who lost both of his hands during World War II delivered a heartfelt Oscar-winning performance as a handicapped veteran who cant accept that his fiancee (Cathy ODonnell) still loves him.THE MEN (1950) -- Marlon Brando made his film debut as a self-pitying war veteran who loses the use of his legs. Adjusting to civilian life become equally difficult for him and his bride-to-be (Teresa Wright).AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER (1957) -- Leo McCareys five-hankie weepie concerned shipboard lovers (Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr) whose plans to reunite six months later at the top of the Empire State Building are squelched when shes left wheelchair-bound after being struck by an automobile.COMING HOME (1978) -- Jane Fonda starred as a Marines wife who becomes romantically involved with a paraplegic veteran (Jon Voight) while her husband is fighting in Vietnam. The movie which earned Oscars for the two stars dealt frankly with the sexual aspect of the characters relationship.-- Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

"Review Me Before You a predictable tear-jerker - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Me Before You a predictable tear-jerkerBy Tony Hicks thicksbayreanewsgroup.comPosted 06/01/2016 125954 PM PDTUpdated 06/01/2016 055930 PM PDT As a joke -- or perhaps not -- the organizers of a recent screening of ""Me Before You"" gave out promotional boxes of tissues for the inevitable point at which the story forces you to blubber in anguish.That pretty much lays it all out right there. They made a movie meant to make you cry.Without giving too much away OK I experienced some mistiness (though I thought the poor woman behind me would require medical attention). ""Me Before You"" is indeed a tear-jerker as anyone who read the Jojo Moyes novel from which its adapted can tell you (Moyes also wrote the screenplay).I dont mind it when filmmakers try to yank my emotions all over a theater. But I do mind it when they do it in such a simple and predictable fashion that I cant think of one thing I found mildly surprising or particularly compelling. That shouldnt be blamed on the actors. ""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke is a joyous whirlwind as Louisa Clark a sunny twentysomething from a working-class English family whose fashion sense falls somewhere between a 1985 Cyndi Lauper video and a John Waters acid trip. Louisa becomes the caretaker for quadriplegic William Traynor (Sam Claflin) the dashing athletic heir to a vast fortune and a former financial whiz kid who lost the use of his limbs in a accident and along the way his will to live.Of course you can see where this is going.Advertisement Which is OK. Its kind of fun to almost believe there are people like Louisa in the world who will do anything short of self-degradation to try making this handsome sarcastic and gloomy fellow want to live again. Clarke plays it for all its worth while Claflin does his job slowly transforming from an angry lost cause full of self-pity to a man who can laugh again even as he has to decide whether he can accept a life on such different terms. But Moyes and director Thea Sharrock kept the love story too shallow to be really intriguing. They seem to have forgotten that great romantic films dont have to be pretty and have skimmed the story of any real human ugliness that would be inherent in such a scenario. They more often tell us about the conflicts instead of showing us. Even one semi-downer of a scene in which William suffers for finally having some real fun (at his exs wedding) is only superficially sad. Then William inexplicably recovers and moves on. ""Me Before You"" follows a simple blueprint of romantic tragedy satisfied with merely trying to manipulate audience emotions instead of digging deep and letting viewers experience the characters pain organically. It also could have explored much further a serious subject that more people face each day as right-to-die laws are passed all over the world. I wouldnt say the film trivializes the issue but it avoids asking the harder questions.Thats not to say ""Me Before You"" doesnt possess some charm. Louisas family and her clueless fitness-obsessed boyfriend Patrick (Matthew Lewis) provide comfortable comedy relief. And there seems to be real chemistry between Clark and Claflin both of whom do their best with what they have. I couldnt help but wonder what they could have done with better material.""Me Before You"" will induce some tears but the real crying shame is how much better this could have been.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67Me Before You   1/2Rating PG-13 (thematic elements and some suggestive material)Cast Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin Charles Dance Janet McTeer Matthew LewisDirector Thea SharrockRunning time 1 hours 50 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

(Alex Bailey/Warner Bros) BY Joe Dziemianowicz NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday June 1 2016 400 AM Title Me Before You Film Info Love blooms between a carefree young woman and the paralyzed man shes hired to care for. Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin (150). PG-13 for thematic elements and some suggestive material. Cable-TV dragon goddess Emilia Clarke doesnt need mythical fire-breathers around her to shine bonfire-bright. She does it all on her own thanks to her inner radiance. Its on full display in ""Me Before You."" Shes been naked on a regular basis in ""Game of Thrones."" She stays fully clothed in this rom-dram tearjerker -- and yet shes never been so exposed. Sam Claflin in a movie based on the book by Jojo Moyes. (Alex Bailey/Warner Bros) Based on a bestseller by English author Jojo Moyes who wrote the screenplay this is a time-honored story of opposites attracting. Blue-collar Louisa (Clarke) or Lou as shes known by her loving family becomes the caretaker for blue-blood quadriplegic Will Traynor (Sam Claflin of ""The Hunger Games""). His family owns the castle in a picturesque English town. 1 photos view gallery Emilia Clarkes hottest moments Characters arent drawn especially deep. Lou is walking sunshine. Shes ever-chipper just like her outlandish Crayola-colored outfits. Shes never even seen a foreign film let alone gone anywhere. Before the accident that left him paralyzed from the neck down Will ruled -- and traveled -- the world. Now hes dour sour and withdrawn. Game of Thrones is not anti-feminist says Emilia Clarke Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin go from an icy meeting to melting into romance. (Alex Bailey/Warner Bros) No rocket scientist is needed to discern that their icy meeting will melt into romance. Or that he changes her. Or that she changes him. But Will grapples with living in a body thats become his enemy. The film becomes a testament to the transcendent power of love -- but not in the way you expect. Thea Sharrock directs with a sure light touch in her big-screen debut. Claflin is affecting as the doomed Will. Janet McTeer is perfection as Wills devoted mother. But the film belongs to Clarke. Her warm and winning star turn lifts this checklist chick flick.

"Me Before You is the best kind of tearjerker (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Me Before You is the best kind of tearjerker (PG-13) Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin star in this adaptation of Jojo Moyes novel. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle cogleMiamiHerald.com5/31/2016 Editor rating 3 Some people just like to cry at the movies. If you are one of those people -- if you have for example actually committed to watching The Fault in Our Stars or The Notebook more than once either endeavor an act of incomprehensible madness -- then chances are you will enjoy Me Before You. And you will undoubtedly get a bit teary.Me Before You has been adapted for the screen by Jojo Moyes (One Plus One The Girl You Left Behind and Me Before Yous sequel After You) from her bestselling novel and so the screenplay is faithful to the source material with necessary omissions. Love stories are Moyes milieu but this one comes with a bite. Despite the amusing bits (and there are many) despite the budding ardor (predictable and crowd-pleasing) despite the rarely seen and irresistible smile of Emilia Clarke (who is not allowed moments of levity as the formidable Daenerys Targaryen the Mother of Dragons on Game of Thrones) Me Before You is a juicy ripe red apple of a romance with a razor blade embedded under its skin.Clarke plays the good-hearted but unambitious Louisa Clark who lives at home in an English village with her family and helps her working-class parents with the rent. When Lou loses her job at a bakery thats closing she applies for a well-paying post as a companion to wealthy handsome and bitter quadriplegic Will Traynor (Sam Claflin the charismatic Finnick Odair of The Hunger Games). Lou does not know how to take care of a quadriplegic but learns quickly shes not expected to Theres a nurse for that. Wills tense mother (Janet McTeer) stresses two things That Lou is there to keep the once-active Will company and to never ever leave him alone for more than a few minutes.First naturally theres distrust on his part and frustration on hers. The movie places less emphasis on the daunting class barrier separating them though it underscores their differences (when Will tells Lou ""You need to broaden your horizons"" he doesnt seem to realize that traveling the world or even to London takes money and Lou doesnt have it). Gradually though they do what people tend to do when theyre thrown together for long periods of time they soften toward each other. Then Lou discovers Wills real plan -- he is determined to commit legal suicide in Sweden. What else can she do but vow to show him a life with her is worth living no matter the constraints?Clarke whos almost unrecognizable here is a large part of what makes the film as engaging as it is; seeing her as the sartorially adventurous Lou wearing spotted pumps a fuzzy orange sweater and a wide grin is startling and weirdly mesmerizing. Claflin is an appealing leading man and the rest of the cast is a Whos Who of Popular British Actors including Brendon Coyle (Mr. Bates of Downton Abbey) as Lous out-of-work but genial dad; Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) as Wills father whose caddish instincts have been excised; and Matthew Lewis (Harry Potters heroic Neville Longbottom) as Lous boyfriend Patrick who prefers prepping for a triathlon to date night.Me Before You has already incited a few complaints about its portrayal of quadriplegics and its glossing over of the acrimonious subject of state-assisted suicide. The film never examines that debate fully and in the interest of time has cut Moyes side plot in which Lou investigates and gets to know the active supportive disabled community. But Me Before You is a sugar-coated romantic bauble not a gritty documentary. Giving into its pleasures is not for everyone but its message -- live boldly as the movies hashtag encourages -- is an admonition thats awfully hard to argue.Cast Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin Charles Dance Janet McTeer Matthew Lewis Brendan Coyle.Director Thea Sharrock.Screenwriter Jojo Moyes adapted from her novel.A Warner Bros. release.

Thea Sharrocks charming new Anglo-weepie Me Before You is a perfect case in point. It may not quite rise to the level of a classic three-hankie tearjerker but its proof that sometimes one or two hankies is more than enough to get the job done. Based on a best-selling 2012 novel by Jojo Moyes (she also penned the screenplay) the film will feel familiar to anyone whos sniffled through Love Story or The Fault in Our Stars. Its better than both. Game of Thrones Emilia Clarke stars as Louisa a bumbling small-town shopgirl who brightens the day of everyone she meets with her bottomless kindness irrepressible smile and quirky Pantone-palette wardrobe. Shes like Love Actually-era Keira Knightley crossed with a Hello Kitty doll. When the local bakery she works at shutters Louisa lands a job as a caretaker to Will a wealthy young London business hotshot who was paralyzed from the neck down in a traffic accident two years earlier. Since hes played by Sam Claflin (of The Hunger Games fame) hes also impossibly good-looking--even if his condition has left him bitterly depressed and cuttingly sarcastic in a wheelchair. You dont have to be Kreskin (or Nicholas Sparks for that matter) to know where this is headed--that these two opposites (hes a storm cloud shes all silver lining) will end up attracting and that love at least for a while will prove stronger than death. But youll forgive the movies cliches because of its surprisingly winning performances. Clarke may start off as a chipper thrift-store Cinderella and Claflin like a prickly Prince Charming but as the film goes on and the frost between them melts both actors give their stock roles unexpected emotional layers. As the saintly Louisa brings Will out of his self-pitying shell by watching foreign films with him whisking him off to the horse races and curling up next to him for deep late-night confessionals Clarkes sincerity doesnt just win Wills heart it wins ours too.  When she smiles the whole screen glows. If all of this seems too good to be true well it is. Will has found his adorable savior but he may not want to be saved. Even with Louisa by his side hell never be the man he was and still wants to be. Its the closest that Sharrock and Moyes come to deviating from the genres formula. But we dont go to romantic melodramas like this looking for surprises. We want to be resold on the power of love. Me Before You doesnt try to reinvent the wheel. Weve all seen some version of this movie before but that doesnt make it any less effective. It knows what it is and embraces it. Now if youll pardon me I have to go wipe something from my eye. Its allergies I swear.

What could have been a pleasurable two-hanky romance between a plucky working-class girl and a rich quadriplegic gets buried in whimsy and suffocated with a terminal case of the cutesies. Forget art or even craft This is the kind of movie that cant even get its shameless audience-pandering in order. It doesnt help that screenwriter Jojo Moyes (adapting her best-selling novel) and director Thea Sharrock (making her big-screen debut) make the heroine of the piece fairly insufferable Luisa has been written as a greatest-hits collection of two-dimensional female screen characters throughout the decades from the can-do shopgirls of the 1930s to the manic pixie dream girls of more recent vintage. (Plus this is the kind of movie that communicates her creative free spirit by having her dress in a kooky parade of bright colors and clashing patterns.) See Video Watch Emilia Clarke Sam Claflin Get Teary in First Trailer for Me Before You On top of that Sharrock has directed Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"" ""Terminator Genisys"") to express practically every emotion by touching her earlobes with her dimples. Whether shes giddily happy or devastated by grief her mouth stretches as wide as possible in scene after scene after scene. Luisa runs this gamut of emotions after shes employed as a caretaker for rich and handsome Will Traynor (Sam Claflin ""The Hunger Games Mockingjay""). Will used to be a London financier who climbed mountains and dove off cliffs and kept the kind of minimal all-white flat where the only color came from a duvet a surfboard and bar stools that were all the same shade of yellow. But then he got hit by a motorcycle crossing the street and was left mostly paralyzed from the collarbone down. Also Read Emilia Clarke on Scorching Game of Thrones Nude Scene That Aint No Body Double Stewing in a literal castle with his parents (played by Janet McTeer and Charles Dance) Will sulks about resisting Luisas attempts to engage him with the world. Hes got an actual nurse - Nathan played by Stephen Peacocke (""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"") - to handle anything thats actually medical or gross so Luisa spends days failing to get through to her charge. Until she does of course and he melts under her aggressively gamine ways. Its only later that Luisa learns that Will has attempted suicide and that he promised his parents to wait six months before traveling to Switzerland to legally end his life. Can Luisa charm Will into finding life worth living? One of the few areas in which ""Me Before You"" excels is the way it takes these end-of-life issues seriously and doesnt chicken out on discussing a serious subject. That one facet is too little and arrives too late though. The films main problem is that Clarke and Claflin have very little chemistry and ""Me Before You"" bends over backwards to make us believe that theyre perfect for each other. It would have been more believable for Luisa to wind up with Nathan or even with Patrick (Matthew Lewis the ""Harry Potter"" series) Luisas fitness-minded boyfriend who goes through the movie with ""Wrong Guy For Her"" over his head in neon. Also Read Jack Huston Emilia Clarke to Star in Thriller Above Suspicion This is a film thats oppressively cozy in a TV commercial way The cinematography (by Remi Adefarasin ""Pride and Prejudice and Zombies"") calls to mind ""Mom Jeans"" and every other ""SNL"" parody of ads aimed at women while the score alternates between toothless love ballads and Craig Armstrongs twinkly score which sounds like the music that plays under the list of side effects in a 60-second spot for prescription medications. Given the relative scarcity of big-screen love stories involving female protagonists ""Me Before You"" seems like a real missed opportunity. Instead its a date-night offering that will make heterosexual men everywhere say ""Next time Im picking the movie."" Email Whos Winning Game of Thrones Top 20 Power Rankings (Photos) In ""Game of Thrones"" the power struggle is constantly in flux. One episode a man could be on top of the world with a massive army behind him. The next week hes got a blade sticking out of his chest. With season 6 of ""Game of Thrones"" entering its second half we are ranking the characters in Westeros and Essos based on their power influence and potential to make a big splash later on down the road. HBO 20.) Theon Greyjoy Every attempt Theon makes to rally the ironborn will probably get him nothing but jokes about how he got castrated. Still his speech at least proved to Yara that he is a devoted ally and after all hes been through Theon needs someone to have his back.HBO19.) Olenna TyrellWesteros most fearless grandma has done a great job outwitting Cersei but Margaerys capture has left her vulnerable. She wants to save her granddaughter from a penance walk but is she setting herself up for tragedy by agreeing to a ceasefire with the Lannisters?HBO18.) Brienne of TarthBrienne has become Sansas confidante holding secrets about where Sansa got information concerning potential troops. When the Starks and Boltons do battle you can bet that she will also become Jon and Sansas top lieutenant. Despite this shes low on our rankings right now because her major personal storyline at the moment is her playing hard-to-get with Tormund.HBO17.) VarysThe eunuch has done a great job putting plans in motion and countering the moves by the Sons of the Harpy but hes finally met his match in Kinvara.HBO16.) Arya Stark A girl may claim to have no name but judging by her reaction to that mocking show that depicted her father and sister as buffoons Arya may still have the attachment to her past that the Faceless Men wish for her to disown. Until she proves herself worthy of joining their ranks or forges a new path for herself she remains at the whims of Jaqen and The Waif.HBO15.) Kinvara Say hello to the First Servant of the Lord of Light. She has the same confidence and grace that Melisandre once had before everything went to hell for Stannis. And Varys attempts to undermine her were gracefully dodged. Is she right that Daenerys is Azor Ahai?HBO14.) Petyr Baelish ""If you didnt know youre an idiot. If you did know youre my enemy."" With those words Sansa broke through Littlefingers defenses in a way that no one ever has before. He was able to impart some last bit of information to Sansa before leaving her sight for good but he will now have to manipulate the battle in the North from afar.HBO13.) Davos SeaworthWith Jon still gathering his wits about him Davos has become Sansas right hand man in their quest to take back the North. It may not be long before he becomes the next Lord Commander.HBO12.) Tyrion LannisterThe language and cultural barriers have made Tyrions job as Steward of Meereen almost as much of a nightmare as being Joffreys Hand was. But his plan to make a truce with the slavers seems to be working and that will at least buy them some more time to hold the door until Daenerys gets back.HBO11.) The Waif The Waif has just been wrecking Arya left and right since the new series started. She thinks Aryas not ready to join the Faceless Men and she may be right considering the unsure looks that were on her face in this episode. For having full control over the lives of Braavos unwitting populace The Waif is put one spot above The Imp.HBO10.) Cersei Lannister The Lioness wasnt present in this episode but she has put her plans to strike back at the Faith Militant in full motion. Its impressive that in spite of everything that has happened she has managed to make an unholy alliance with the Tyrells but how long will it last?HBO9.) Jorah MormontJorahs speech to his khalessi was truly moving. It seemed at first that we might be seeing the Andal for the last time as he gets the luxury of heading off to die offscreen. Instead hes been sent off on a race against time to find a cure for greyscale before it consumes him. He enters the top ten for finding a way to get back in Daenerys good graces.HBO8.) Jon SnowJon has taken a backseat to Sansa since they reunited but you cant blame him. Unlike the fans Jon took no pleasure in executing Olly and just wanted to be done with killing. He remains high on this list because he still has the wildlings at his command and all it takes is one big moment for Jon to snap out of his stupor and whip out Longclaw again.HBO7.) High Sparrow For a man who supposedly rejected worldly pleasures the Sparrow is enjoying a lot of power right now. He has the Tyrells and the Lannisters by the necks though they are starting to realize who the biggest threat in Kings Landing is right now.HBO6.) Bran Stark Hes not fully ready and he just lost his closest buddy but Bran is now in possession of an immeasurable power that could turn everything in Westeros on its head the power to influence the past through whispers. Also Read Game of Thrones Did Bran Stark Cause the Mad Kings Downfall?HBO5.) Yara Greyjoy Despite a rousing speech Yara did not have Daenerys ability to bring men to follow the will of a queen. That didnt faze her though as she promptly went out and took all of the Greyjoy ships for herself.HBO4.) Ramsay BoltonHe didnt appear in episode 5 but the Lord of Winterfells evil presence hangs over every scene in the north. He holds all the cards right now and the Starks will have to overcome the odds to defeat him.HBO3.) Euron Greyjoy Say hello to the new Lord of the Iron Islands. Euron has paid the price for Balons throne and now seeks to do the same with Yara and Theon. Not even the loss of his entire fleet fazes him.HBO2.) Daenerys Targaryen Dany did not do much on this episode but remains high on the list for bringing the Dothraki back under her sway. But while we saw the queens wrath in episode 4 episode 5 showed her capacity for forgiveness as she commanded Jorah to find a way to live while on the verge of tears at the thought of losing him.HBO1.) Sansa StarkIt is breathtaking how much Sansa has changed. The naive princess is now taking charge of reclaiming Winterfell and letting Littlefinger know just how badly he screwed her over by by handing her over to Ramsay. Once the most powerless girl in the series Sansa now seeks to be the Queen in the North.HBO Previous ; Next 1 of 21 Women are taking charge on ""Game of Thrones"" but powerful bad guys still sit high on our rankings In ""Game of Thrones"" the power struggle is constantly in flux. One episode a man could be on top of the world with a massive army behind him. The next week hes got a blade sticking out of his chest. With season 6 of ""Game of Thrones"" entering its second half we are ranking the characters in Westeros and Essos based on their power influence and potential to make a big splash later on down the road.

Daily Edition Login to download Me Before You Film Review 500 AM PDT 5/24/2016 by Sheri Linden FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A distractingly sparkly feel-good tearjerker. TWITTER 6/3/2016 Cinderella story meets end-of-life dialectic in a romance starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and based on Jojo Moyes popular novel. A bubbly broody love triangle in which death is the third party Me Before You stars Game of Thrones Emilia Clarke as the caregiver of a quadriplegic portrayed by The Hunger Games Sam Claflin. Brought together by need -- hers for a job his for a friend -- theyre chalk and cheese and therefore by the rules of the movie-romance game meant for each other. Theres no question that Jojo Moyes adaptation of her popular novel directed by Thea Sharrock has more on its mind than such storytelling conventions. But far too much of this high-gloss tearjerker proceeds as a by-the-numbers romantic fantasy nudging the viewer every step of the way. The chemistry between the leads and a few finely etched supporting turns provide welcome counterweight to the movies formulaic progression welcome especially for those who have seen their fair share of entries in the love-story-with-medical-complication subgenre. Those who havent -- teens and young adults -- will most appreciate the feature but all-ages fans of the book and of cryfests like The Fault in Our Stars (whose screenwriters had at one point been tapped for the adaptation) will be eagerly getting out their handkerchiefs. At the big-screen helm for the first time stage wunderkind Sharrock takes a straightforward approach relying on such familiar tools of the trade as the pop-song-backed montage and ping-pong cross-cutting in conversations. She reserves the films visual flourishes for its design elements and settings and the drama opens with one of its most striking images two lovers in a bed so white and fluffy it might be a cloud or a romance novel cover. Dashing go-getter Will Traynor (Claflin) waking in his London dream pad beside his girlfriend (Vanessa Kirby) is starting another glamorous day. The opening section sets up the yin-yang between thirtysomething Will and 26-year-old Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Clarke) with admirable economy. In contrast to his moneyed joie de vivre she still lives in the cramped home of her parents (Brendan Coyle and Samantha Spiro) and like many women in screen romances has a boyfriend (Matthew Lewis) whos cartoonishly wrong for her. Lous explosively colorful girlie getups announce her quirky vivacity -- costume designer Jill Taylor has a field day with fuzzy sweaters and polka-dot shoes -- but any ambitions attached to that creativity have fizzled. When Lou and Will meet hes almost completely paralyzed two years after an accident cut short his seemingly unstoppable upward trajectory. That Wills stoically suffering mother (Janet McTeer powerfully understated) hires the inexperienced Lou in the first place is a testament to either the womans desperation or her ability to see beyond a nicely played wardrobe malfunction to Lous compassion and resilience. With a physical therapist (Stephen Peacocke) tending to Wills hygiene Lou is expected to occupy a different realm of intimacy as a hired friend of sorts. ""You can work out your level of interaction"" his mother tells her. But the movie doesnt quite allow such leeway for the viewer instead underlining every exchange and reaction. In the castle that rises above Lous village and is Wills family home she becomes an Eliza Doolittle to his princely Henry Higgins. He encourages her to widen her horizons; first step watching movies with subtitles. The self-actualization goes two ways with Lou gradually predictably drawing Will out of the fortress -- literal and figurative -- where hes been biding his wheelchair-bound time in sullen despair. Alarmed by the jagged scar on his arm from a botched attempt at self-destruction Lou determines to make him fall in love with life again and cancel his pending date with assisted suicide in Switzerland. Cue the string of storybook excursions both local and far-flung each one higher on the aphrodisiac meter until the ultimate island getaway (Mallorca plays Mauritius). With their charm and good looks Clarke and Claflin give the duos sublimated sensuality an undeniable charge enhanced by the honeyed light of Remi Adefarasins camerawork. Clark overdoes Lous exuberance though; whatever emotional complexity and uncertainties the character had on the page get lost amid the performances insistent effervescence. And however superbly delivered Lous rant about unhappy marriages indicates a level of understanding thats at odds with her supposed lack of introspection. Within the extreme physical constraints of his role Claflin works a subtler palette giving Wills mourning for his former self an affecting depth beyond the screenplays all too obvious signposts. Both leads embody the class divide that their characters have crossed with Andrew McAlpines polished production design accentuating the difference between the spirited bustle of Lous home life and the quiet anguish of the Traynors well-appointed rooms. The pointedness of the dialogue and direction can when it isnt detracting from the story serve the pared-down supporting roles well heightening smartly restrained performances that convey whole backstories. Thats the case when Lous crucifix-wearing mother reacts to the idea of euthanasia when her father buoys her with encouraging words and especially in the potent silences between Wills coexisting parents played to perfection by McTeer and Charles Dance. A cameo by Joanna Lumley as a stranger spouting agreeably tart words of wisdom is entirely unnecessary. But its nonetheless a gratifying jolt of Lumley-ness as this villainless fairy tale draws toward its happily mawkish ever after. Distributors Warner Bros.

May 24 2016 | 0500AM PT Imagine ""The Intouchables"" with more romance and less chemistry crossbred with a far tamer version of ""Pretty Woman"" so lacking in eroticism that its PG-13 rating seems unduly harsh and youre halfway toward picturing Thea Sharrocks ""Me Before You."" Pairing a working-class British lass with an icy quadriplegic aristocrat whose heart shes been hired to melt ""Me Before You"" would seem to boast a cant-miss premise -- class divides and medical misfortune being the peanut butter-and-jelly of tear-jerking romance. But Sharrocks technically-sound yet workmanlike direction never sells the emotional peaks and troughs the characters are alternately too exaggerated and too buttoned-down to come to life and the final resolution pushes the film into morally provocative territory that it has neither the inclination nor the courage to confront. That said considering the popularity of Jojo Moyes bestselling source novel (she adapts her own work here) and Hollywoods bizarre reluctance to make the sort of big-hearted romantic dramas that would seem to be its most reliable date-night draws the film ought to do solid business burnishing the rising careers of its stars Emilia Clarke (""Game of Thrones"") and Sam Claflin (""The Hunger Games"" movies). Though Clarke is the clear protagonist Claflin is the star of the films first reel. Here hes cast as Will Traynor a debonair London financier from a family rich enough to own its own castle who spends his spare time skiing windsurfing cliff-diving and bedding flashy women. In spite of these high-risk pursuits hes horribly injured the one time he tries to play it safe Opting against taking his motorcycle to work on a rainy morning hes hit by a bike while crossing the street and left paralyzed. Two years later we find ourselves in an unnamed English country town backgrounded at all times by the looming Traynor castle in the distance. Twenty-six-year-old Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Clarke) has lived here all her life helping support her large extended family as a waitress. Shes burdened with a limp noodle of a boyfriend (Matthew Lewis) who ignores her to pursue his twin passions of running and entrepreneurship; to wit hes introduced running laps in his ""Young Entrepreneur of the Year"" shirt. Guileless naive and accident-prone Lou is such a ray of sunshine that her offer to wrap up a customers leftover sandwich elicits the sort of reaction youd usually see from recent lottery winners but shes thrown for a loop when her quaint tea shop closes down. Heading to the unemployment office shes assigned a lucrative temp position at the Traynor mansion. The job essentially is to be a paid companion for Will who now sports scraggly hair a beard and an arsenal of withering quips. As the script is a bit too quick to note her position doesnt require her to do any of the real heavy lifting that caring for a quadriplegic demands with bathroom and bathing duties handled by a hunky nurse (Stephen Peacocke). No as Wills imperious mother (Janet McTeer) and kindly father (Charles Dance) explain shes there to cheer him up. Like too many filmic depictions of good-hearted lower-class people Lou is clearly meant to be relatably ordinary but instead comes across as frustratingly dim if not emotionally stunted She is equally aghast by the notion that her caregiver job requires her to occasionally dispense medication as she is by the revelation that Will watches films that require subtitles. Yet in spite of her continually insane wardrobe and borderline ineptitude Will eventually warms up to Lou hoping to expand her provincial horizons and she starts to bring a bit of genuine cheer into his sterile abode. However Lou soon learns the real implications of her job Distraught by the loss of his old lifestyle and beset by chronic pain - in keeping with the films misguided gentility were often told of his suffering yet scarcely allowed to really feel it - Will plans to end his life at a dying-with-dignity facility in Switzerland. Hes promised his mother to spend six months weighing the decision and she hired Lou as part of a last-ditch campaign to help change his mind. Horrified Lou starts plotting a series of outings and luxury vacations to brighten Wills life. These are deep complicated issues the film wades into and it quickly winds up out of its depth. Aside from its inelegant way of addressing the politics of euthanasia -- with the con side represented by a character never previously identified as religious now prominently wearing a crucifix -- ""Me Before Yous"" admirable presentation of a disabled person as a swoon-worthy romantic lead collides awkwardly with its implicit suggestion that perhaps such a life isnt even worth living and the undercurrents of wish-fulfillment leave a sour taste. The skittish delicacy with which it tiptoes around the realities of quadriplegia doesnt help; 2014s romance ""The Fault in Our Stars"" was far bolder and more honest about the painful details of living with serious medical difficulties and that was a film aimed at teenagers. Claflin and Clarke are both effortlessly appealing actors yet neither of their performances really click. Clarke has a hugely expressive face but too often here she simply cycles back and forth between aggressively adorkable cutesiness and dewy-eyed pathos as if shes continually modeling for either a Kewpie doll or a marble statue of the Pieta. The range of Claflins character is likewise limited with his attitude toward Lou shifting on a dime from condescending distaste to condescending affection. Sharrock a veteran theater director making her filmmaking debut certainly maintains an air of sweetness throughout and several scenes throb with unexpected resonance. The dignified mortification on Wills face when Lou recruits a gang of blokes to lift his wheelchair out of the mud is affectingly underplayed and a late wedding scene hums with the sort of real romantic charge that goes missing elsewhere. But too many of the bigger moments play out with curious airlessness as on-the-nose music cues from Ed Sheeran and Imagine Dragons give heavy scenes a saggy atmosphere. But thats ""Me Before You"" in a nutshell A melodrama with soft-rock ballads where its beating heart should be. Film Review Me Before YouReviewed at Warner Bros. Studios Burbank Calif. May 20 2016.

Innocent says July 9 2016 at 437 pm Great movie but sad ending.. I thot the lady would get pragnt while on holiday and the gentel man would have a reason to live again Reply Abraham Escobedo Salas says July 4 2016 at 1012 pm I thought about this too happy to find honest reviews like yours. ""But too many of the bigger moments play out with curious airlessness as on-the-nose music cues from Ed Sheeran and Imagine Dragons give heavy scenes a saggy atmosphere. But thats ""Me Before You"" in a nutshell A melodrama with soft-rock ballads where its beating heart should be"" Totally agree. Reply Bobbie says June 26 2016 at 828 pm I saw the film and was glad I didnt read all the lousy reviews beforehand that I read afterwards. The negative reviews completely missed the depth. I thought it was about a much-debated topic of how much suffering or pain can an individual endure - and be asked to endure. I am not sure what I would do but its worth thinking about. I also thought it was a good bit on how some things money cannot buy - health sometimes. And Louisa was just an ordinary girl without much promise and took the job for the money - and I thought it was interesting how she evolved through the experience with Will. I thought it was incredibly moving and the reviewers themselves (that I read) just didnt get it. I did see where some disability groups have been saying the movie shows that a disabled life isnt worth living - I didnt get that at all but I respect their point of view. Someone cited Stephen Hawking - I would say they have a point and NO one has lived as long with ALS and he is still going. But somewhere I do think perhaps it is ones choice - though I understand the ethics and moral dilemmas are there. But in the film it was Wills choice as was poignantly demonstrated by how much it was not his parents nor Louisas wishes. Reply Iliyana says June 24 2016 at 1257 pm I saw this recently. I genuinely only went so I could see Emilia Clarke in a completely different in essence role than what were used to. It was quite good despite the fact I dont really like romantic films. Reply Rose Marie says June 23 2016 at 539 am I like the story very much. I dont like the ending though. The ending that I like is for Lou and Will to get married and live happily ever after. Reply Jake says June 20 2016 at 437 am Emilia Clarke should get an Oscar nod. Simply one of the best performances of the year Reply Jen says June 12 2016 at 445 pm I just loved it. Call me romantic or foolish but I loved it. It was a sweet tale of life love and loss. It was not a snuff movie. The end was incredibly sad and I felt the sentiment was well protrayed by the actors director and writer. Maybe people should go in with an open mind and heart and enjoy the film for what it was a beautiful tale of two people who would never be together. Any one going to see a romantic comedy with a cynicle heart is far more foolish than me. I just enjoyed what it was and came out happy. Reply RU Kidding says June 3 2016 at 414 am Im surprised that important plot points that illustrated Lous characters reticence to join the real world were entirely left out. And the one scene that wouldve most poignantly illustrated their bond was as well. Disappointing fluff and with Moyes adapting her own work confounding. Reply Sandra F says May 25 2016 at 110 am Or for a teenage girl with Reply Melissa Gatlin says May 24 2016 at 603 pm Actually its a snuff film for those that believe that those with disabilities should be euthanized. Reply LOL says May 24 2016 at 1142 am This is part of the subgenera of Illness/ Disabled Porn for millennial young women where a dorky girl gets to love and look after a malady-ridden hot stud. Reply Vince says May 24 2016 at 406 pm hit the nail on the god damn head there Reply James says June 20 2016 at 441 am Thats ridiculous it is ONE story. In no way did it say that all people must do this. See All 13 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content HBO President On Vinyls Demise On-Screen Violence -TCA Chelsea Vs.
