Comments Code Name The Cleaner Cedric the Entertainers starring vehicles have been mostly domestic comedies (The Honeymooners Johnson Family Vacation) so a knotty mystery is a change of pace. He wakes up in a hotel room with no memory of who he is lying next to a dead FBI agent and a suitcase full of money; after making off with the latter he falls back into his old identity as a janitor but keeps having flashbacks of taking part in a heart-thumping special ops maneuver. As a diner waitress who turns out to be an agent Lucy Liu makes a surprisingly sympatico love interest for Cedric and theres some pretty good improvised shtick from DeRay Davis as a wacky janitor. But these are small pleasures in a movie that never really generates any serious laughs. Les Mayfield directed. PG-13 91 min. By J.R.

With Cedric the Entertainer Lucy Liu. Director Les Mayfield (131).PG-13 Sexual content crude humor violence. At area theaters. Yep its January ... the month when a movies end-credit outtakes are guaranteed to be funnier than any scene from the actual film. In the loose final moments of ""Code Name The Cleaner"" we get the sense that if star Cedric the Entertainer had been left to his own devices he might have had a chance to live up to his name. Instead his outsize personality is wiped clean off the screen thanks to Les Mayfields abrasive direction of a dusty script that should have been tossed in the trash. Cedric plays Jake a janitor who wakes up in a hotel room one morning with a dead FBI agent next to him. If that isnt trouble enough he also has amnesia so he doesnt know if he should trust the gorgeous blond (Nicollette Sheridan) who says shes his wife or the cute waitress (Lucy Liu) who claims to be his girlfriend. He himself might be an undercover agent or just a lowly employee at a corrupt video game corporation. Either way hes clearly caught up in a tangled high-stakes mystery. Were also caught up in a mystery of massive proportions How do films this stale and generic continue to get made let alone with topflight talent? Cedric has been stealing scenes from bigger names for nearly a decade; he deserves better than a few amusingly-improvised minutes at the end of his own movie. And so do we.

"Cleaner Happily Hollywood Slop Is Unsightly Sadly washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Cleaner Happily Hollywood Slop Is Unsightly Sadly Cedric the Entertainer? Yes. Cedric the Entertainer Who Picks Good Projects? Hes not in ""The Cleaner."" (By Annabel Reyes -- New Line Productions) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 5 2007 Its a ritual as reliable as the ball dropping in Times Square Early each year Hollywood -- having spent Christmas cramming prestige pictures and Oscar bait into theaters in time to qualify for awards and critics lists -- delivers a collective ""gotcha"" unloading their dregs on moviegoers too desperate or too narcotized by holiday turkey to notice. Happy New Year everyone and welcome to The Dumps. Thats what the movie industry calls it ""the dumps"" which describes what Hollywood is doing and the mood it leaves audiences in. And ""Code Name The Cleaner"" and ""Happily NEver After"" the first dumps across the bow in 2007 stand as textbook examples of the phenomenon both in their aesthetic values (little to none) worldview (cynical) and utter disposability. You wont see them and even if you do you wont remember it the next day. Theyre the cinematic equivalents of the bad traffic jam unqualified torture at the time but utterly forgotten by the first martini. (Which reminds me Waiter) Of the two movies ""The Cleaner"" has the best chance of actually tempting people into theaters thanks to Cedric the Entertainer the hugely popular -- and just plain huge -- stand-up comedian. In this by-the-numbers action comedy he plays a humble janitor who awakes one day in a strange hotel room with a dead guy at his side; hes lost his memory and spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out why hes apparently involved with two women (Nicollette Sheridan and Lucy Liu) why he keeps having flashbacks of being an elite spy and why the FBI is after him. Aside from Cedrics admittedly appealing persona -- hes always watchable even in dreck like this -- theres absolutely nothing to recommend ""The Cleaner"" not the putative comedy (watch Cedric dance lasciviously with a lingerie-clad Sheridan) nor the action which kicks in only at the end and seems to be composed of martial arts stunts Jackie Chan deemed too cheesy. Advice Skip ""The Cleaner"" and watch ""The Original Kings of Comedy"" instead. Judging from the number of walkouts at a recent free screening of ""Happily NEver After"" this one takes the dubious prize for Worst Dump of the Week. This computer-animated fractured fairy tale can be described as a family film only in the sense that its a film the whole family will want to avoid. Sarah Michelle Gellar voices the character of Ella a gamine scullery maid who longs to be invited to the ball so she can meet the handsome prince. ""Happily NEver After"" which has been written and directed by People Youve NEver Heard Of seeks to turn the traditional Cinderella narrative on its head confecting a story in which the wicked stepmother takes over and the bad guys not the usual ""dorky ingenues and pretentious princes"" win the day. At least the premise of ""Happily NEver After"" showed promise Heaven knows kids could use a feminist revision of the usual tale that begins in passive victimhood and ends in marriage. The movie raises that issue -- but only a minute before reverting to slick snarky and un-subversive form. The cast is rounded out by Sigourney Weaver (channeling her fabulous performance in ""Holes"") as perhaps the first evil stepmother in Grimm history with junk in the trunk and Freddie Prinze Jr. as a palace servant who looks like a cross between alt-rocker Jeff Tweedy and a bit player from ""Shrek."" Advice Skip ""Happily NEver After"" and . . . oh just skip it. Code Name The Cleaner(84 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content crude humor and some violence. Happily NEver After(87 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for some mild action and rude humor.

Photo 2005 Annabel Reyes/New Line Productions Photo Annabel Reyes And now for Cedric the Building Custodian 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Code Name The Cleaner Comedy. Starring Cedric the Entertainer Lucy Liu Nicollette Sheridan and Will Patton. Directed by Les Mayfield. (PG-13. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Code Name The Cleaner"" isnt an especially ambitious film. The spy comedy falls somewhere between ""Lethal Weapon II"" and ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" on the plot believability index. But theres a level of improvisational humor that gives Cedric the Entertainers latest a slight edge over most lowbrow comedies. Although the finished product isnt great its more akin to a bad Steve Martin movie from the 1980s than bad Pauly Shore from the 1990s. We mean that as a compliment (sort of). Cedric has always been at his best when hes asked to act as little as possible. This isnt a product of being a bad actor -- its because scripts and characters limit his style of humor. His stand-up routine on ""The Kings of Comedy"" and constant riffing in ""Barbershop"" displayed Cedrics greatest skills as a comic. Movies where he doesnt play something close to his own goofy hip persona -- such as the strict and nerdy father in ""Johnson Family Vacation"" -- are usually painful to sit through. In that way the conventional and predictable story in ""The Cleaner"" often works to the films advantage. Director Les Mayfield fills the movie with a stale premise a score that could have come from a 1980s episode of ""Simon amp; Simon"" and ridiculous plot turns that border on insulting -- but hes smart enough to let Cedric wreak havoc through the production. (This becomes even more evident during the end-of-movie outtakes where the comic does one scene at least three ways.) Cedric plays Jake a janitor who suffers from amnesia and thinks hes a secret agent. The FBI and some mysterious bad guys want him with two beautiful women (Lucy Liu and Nicollette Sheridan) claiming to be his girlfriend and wife. Any more exposition is a waste of newspaper ink. The twists and turns in this movie arent particularly compelling -- if you average more than one completed word in the Jumble puzzle then youll see most of them a mile away -- and they dont really matter. Plot isnt any more important to ""Code Name The Cleaner"" than it is to a porn movie. Audiences are coming to see Cedric who is always likable and frequently spouts jokes that are original and on point. ""Im rich I live in a big house and Im married to a white woman"" Jake asks himself in the first few minutes. ""Am I Lionel Richie?"" The script doesnt give anyone else much to do and most of the supporting actors respond by overacting and generate zero laughs. But lesser-known comics DeRay Davis and Niecy Nash spell Cedric for a few minutes here and there in hilarious sketch-like rants as a fellow janitor and a security guard. Its worth noting that theres an insane amount of product placement in this movie to the point where ""The Cleaner"" should make money whether anybody goes to it or not. The good news is Cedric can make even eating Skittles sort of funny -- and he easily saves this movie from being a wreck. -- Advisory This movie contains adult language mild violence and a few scenes with sexual foreplay. Cedric never takes his shirt off but there is a picture of him in ice skating tights that many moviegoers might find disturbing.

"Cedrics act is far from entertaining - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Cedrics act is far from entertaining Cedric the Entertainer plays a janitor who thinks hes a spy in ""Code Name The Cleaner."" (new line cinema via krt) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  January 5 2007 Any movie that asks Lucy Liu to call Cedric the Entertainer her ""boo"" ought to be better than ""Code Name The Cleaner"" -- or worse. But its another standard-issue bad star-vehicle action-comedy this time for Cedric.He plays a janitor named Jake which is not a name Cedric appears to know how to play. The janitor thinks hes a spy -- ""James Bond on Red Bull"" he says (oh if only). He has no memory of anything but he woke up next to a dead FBI agent is apparently married to Nicollette Sheridan  and Lucy Liu (a waitress until suddenly shes not) is his mistress -- make that boo.So its ""Memento"" for dummies. But to this movies credit I couldnt follow it either. Gradually Jake realizes hes a major player in a weapon-of-mass-destruction conspiracy involving a video-game chip. Nobody is who they appear to be not even Cedric whos blander than ever.""The Cleaner"" is a title that easily applies to what his rising Hollywood star has done for the ""Entertainer"" part of Cedrics nom de fame he practically squeaks. There was probably a moment before he was doing goose voices with Oprah in ""Charlottes Web"" before he was hosting the Black Movie Awards  when Cedric would have needed a movie like ""Code Name The Cleaner."" He would have torn up the dumb sex jokes and lame race gags. This is the movie of a man in his lean years the early ones.Tummy and all Cedric is no longer lean. Now he looks as indifferent to being here as Liu and Sheridan do and when Nicollette Sheridan cant be bothered to have fun in a bra and panties somethings extremely wrong. Will Patton  as a software executive is unkempt and hammy but whats new about that? And straight-to-cable action veteran Mark Dacascos does get in a few high kicks as the corporate villain.You can tell who needs ""The Cleaner"" by how loud in it they are. Niecy Nash  one of the cops from the Comedy Central improv show ""Reno 911"" could rouse the dead. She has a small part as a building attendant with the hots for Cedric. He cant remember loving her up at a Christmas party. Now she requires a date and a classy one ""I dont want no damn nine-piece""DeRay Davis steals a few scenes as a motor-mouthed janitor with hip-hop aspirations. He bets he could out-street-cred Tupac and 50 Cent were he to rap in a coma. You probably have to hear his hyped-up delivery to find it as funny as it is. But he and Nash give this movie that sweet keepin-it-real desperation it needs. Neither of them is well-off or famous enough to waste the opportunity hence they all but shout ""This is a stick up"" in their scenes. Still they have got to start robbing better junk than this.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

When the closing-credit outtakes during ""Code Name The Cleaner"" prove almost wholly unfunny its doubly enlightening in terms of the haphazard exercise that preceded them inasmuch as Cedric the Entertainer is shown riffing through variations on most of his lines -- dovetailing with the movies general disregard for script or story. January is usually not the time to expect much high art among new releases but this is an especially limp star vehicle that delivers a few widely spaced moments of frivolity before what should be a quick mop-up trip to the DVD aisles. Director Les Mayfield has a relatively long roster of not terribly distinguished but occasionally profitable comedies to his credit the more recent including ""The Man"" and ""Blue Streak."" Here he almost entirely hands the reins to producer and star Cedric a talented fellow who cant generate enough mirth to breathe life into this stale spy spoof. Cedric plays Jake who awakens in a hotel room next to a dead FBI agent with no memory of who he is or how he got there. Stumbling out hes picked up by the beautiful Diane (Nicollette Sheridan) who professes to be his wife and whisks him away to a sprawling mansion. Surveying his circumstances Jake lets loose one of the movies few clever lines ""Am I Lionel Richie?"" Ah but those shadowy flashbacks in his head suggest that Jake might be some sort of spy and the fact that people are chasing him puts him in a classic Hitchcockian nightmare the everyman harboring some sought-after prize. Escaping Diane and her henchmen Jake hooks up with a waitress (Lucy Liu) who insists he is simply a janitor the blow to the head having infused him with delusions of grandeur. Working from a script credited to Robert Adetuyi and George Gallo Mayfield cant decide whether he wants to make a full-blown (if cut-rate by way of Vancouver) spy movie or a screwball comedy. As such the action periodically screeches to a halt so Cedric can engage in some bit of buffoonery (a Dutch dance number proves wooden in more ways than one) or another performer can step in to do the same. On that latter score both DeRay Davis and Niecy Nash as Jakes co-workers at least inject some life into this otherwise moribund affair albeit by delivering what are in essence stand-up interludes. These wackier ingredients prove especially difficult for Liu who wrestles more painfully than most with the stilted dialogue. On the plus side she gets to put some of those ""Kill Bill"" martial-arts chops to use and (along with Cedric) is bestowed one of the 15 producer credits which surely must be some kind of record for a project this modest in scope. Although theres a long history of outlandish action comedies those responsible for ""The Cleaner"" have failed to recognize the basic need to blend the disparate elements together instead of splicing two movies into one by making a cheap spy yarn and ad-libbing some comedy. Whether that was the precise formula its surely not new not improved and by no means potent enough to get the job done.

"Code Name The Cleaner | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; code-name-the-cleaner ) Code Name The Cleaner (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli It is accepted practice that a comedy even the most outrageous one must have some sort of skeletal plot structure. Most of these are nonsense and sometimes impede the viewers ability to enjoy the films humorous antics. Such is the case with Code Name The Cleaner a vehicle for Cedric the Entertainer that takes its amnesia/secret agent plotline so seriously that there are times when the laughter disappears for long stretches (until the screenplay remembers the movie is supposed to be funny and lets Cedric loose). The problem is while the thriller aspects of the movie are serviceable they arent good enough to form the basis of anything more serious than a sit-com and by spending as much time on them as Code Name The Cleaner does it makes the film at times seem drawn-out and tedious. From past experience viewers know that Cedric the Entertainer can be very funny. While there are times when Code Name The Cleaner highlights his comedic abilities there arent enough of them for the movie to rise above late-night cable fare (at best). Cedrics highlight reel from this movie is maybe about ten minutes long. That means theres well over an hour of filler. At times the movie has aspirations of straying into genuine thriller territory but its missing a few key ingredients like credibility and tension. Its like a bad episode of the old TV series Get Smart. However it does answer a less-than-pressing question what if The Bourne Identity was turned into a sit-com? When Jake Rodgers (Cedric the Entertainer) awakens on a bed in a hotel room he has no memory of how he got there whose dead body is lying next to him or even who he is. He flees the hotel although not before taking a briefcase full of money and finds the area around the hotel to be crawling with cops. A striking blond named Diane (Nicolette Sheridan) who claims to be his wife takes him ""home"" and begins doing everything in her power to revive his memory. Apparently he has knowledge of the location of a valuable microchip and a lot of people want to know where it is. Feeling that his ""wife"" may not be trustworthy Jake escapes her clutches and seeks out Gina (Lucy Liu) who may or may not have been Jakes girlfriend. Shes not to happy to see him and even less happy that he doesnt remember who she is but she agrees to help him. Meanwhile Dianes accomplice is revealed to be a federal agent (Callum Keith Rennie) and both of them work for the CEO of a video game company Eric Hauck (Mark Dacascos). With all the chasing thats going on Jake begins to wonder whether hes a secret agent and whether his amnesia is the result of something that happened to him on a mission. Theres only so much that a high-profile comedian can bring to a movie like this and theres no doubt that Cedric the Entertainer gives it a game try. As always however its the director and screenwriters who control where things are going and Cedric doesnt get much help from them. The script is sophomoric and the director has the kind of track record an established actor should be wary of. Les Mayfield has been at the helm for such timeless classics as Encino Man Flubber and American Outlaws. Expectations that he might make a better film with Code Name The Cleaner are misplaced. Lucy Liu is a nice sidekick and she works well with Cedric but shes the only one in the cast who doesnt embarrass herself. Nicolette Sheridan is painfully bad; based on this performance she would be well-advised to milk Desperate Housewives for as long as she can. (I remember her being funny in Noises Off but that was eons ago.) Callum Keith Rennie manages to be as boring a bad guy as one can imagine. And - talk about strange casting - the part of the Big Bad Boss is played by Mark Dacascos. The name might not mean much to many people but Food Network watchers will recognize him as The Chairman from Iron Chef America. One half expects to see Bobby Flay emerge from the shadows wielding a chefs knife. Allez cuisine I must admit there are far worse comedies out there many of which will be opening in the next eight weeks. This one is at least sporadically funny and didnt make me want to rush into the projection booth and sabotage the celluloid. Its tolerable although no better. Cedric provides an occasional highlight while Mayfield keeps piling on the garbage. Attending with low expectations and an abiding love of Cedric the Entertainer may represent the only way this movie can be enjoyed on any level.

By Christy Lemire updated 1/4/2007 22548 PM ET 2007-01-04T192548 Print Font + - Jimmy Kimmel once joked that Cedric the Entertainer chose that name for himself because it paid better than going by ""Cedric the Janitor."" Now Cedric is stuck playing a janitor in ""Code Name The Cleaner"" the kind of ridiculously silly movie that only comes out during the notorious dumping ground of the first week of January (if youll pardon the trash pun). The comedian stars as custodian Jake Rodgers who believes hes a super spy when he wakes up in a hotel room next to a dead FBI agent and a suitcase full of cash with no memory of who he is or how he got there. (Director Les Mayfield says the intention was to create a comic take on ""The Bourne Identity."" Somewhere Robert Ludlum is spinning in his grave.) Lucy Liu gets to show off her ""Charlies Angels"" fighting skills as Cedrics waitress girlfriend Gina and Nicolette Sheridan gets to show off her ""Desperate Housewives"" bod as Diane the seductress who may or may not be his wife. Except for a couple of Cedrics ad-libs which are funnier in the closing-credit outtakes than in the movie itself the whole thing is just lame and inane. Jake bumbles his way from one situation to the next with Gina looking for a secret computer chip from the video game company where he works which he may have hidden someplace before he got bonked on the head. Various generic baddies are on their tail looking for the chip too including a corrupt FBI agent (Callum Keith Rennie) and the video game companys slick CEO (Mark Dacascos). But he gets to have some fun too -- at least its presented as fun even though its not funny -- practicing his horrendous golf swing and ordering random stuff from the butler at the mansion he thinks is his. He also dresses up and performs as part of a clog-dancing group to sneak back into the hotel where the killing happened which is vaguely amusing because he just looks so goofy and out of place. In theory were supposed to be piecing together the mystery of who Jake is and what happened to him. But its hard to invest that kind of energy in this character and this film because its so painfully shallow. (Mayfield previously directed ""Encino Man"" ""Flubber"" and ""The Man"" and the script comes from Robert Adetuyi and George Gallo.) Whether Cedrics character is truly a highly trained special ops stud or just a regular guy whos played too many video games the memory of this movie will have left your brain before you walk out of the theater. If youre lucky. (c) 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed.
