At first glance the narrative trajectory might seem to be on a different vector from the one favored by most sports movies. Its about the impact of a loss on a team its players and the community. Ultimately however all the big moments in When the Game Stands Tall relate to individual game wins including the one at the climax. The critical defeat which occurs early in the proceedings serves as little more than a plot point and its ramifications are handled in a perfunctory manner laced with a lot of ""losing builds character""-type homilies. In the late summer of 2004 the De La Salle Spartans the varsity football team of a Concord California high school held the longest winning streak in organized football 151 games over 12 undefeated seasons. On September 4 De La Salle had the streak snapped after falling to the underdog Bellvue Wolverines. The loss stunned the sports world at the time and with the tenth anniversary of the momentous date approaching a film version of the event and its aftermath reaches screens. When the Game Stands Tall provides sufficient background for the 2004-05 season opener to bring the uninitiated up to speed. During the summer following the Spartans march to their 12th state title a star player is shot to death Coach Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caveziel) suffers a heart attack and most of the teams top talent departs for college glory. After the loss Ladouceur must seek to refocus his players so their legacy becomes greater than that of ""the boys who broke the streak."" Credit is due to director Thomas Carter for the pacing and execution of the football scenes. Carter understands how to used camera angles editing and judicious ""fast forwarding"" to draw the viewer into the action. Two matches in particular - a pivotal game against powerhouse Long Beach Poly and a state championship contest - are as energetic and exciting as any football recreation committed to film. However the films laudable assets stop where the sidelines begin. Dramatically When the Game Stands Tall is a mishmash of syrupy dialogue stock situations and trite characters. Its manipulative soap opera melodrama crossed with a Sunday morning sermon. The cast doesnt feature a roster of A-listers. Instead character actors and up-and-coming thespians fill the roles. Jim Caviezel who remains best known for his portrayal of Jesus for Mel Gibson gets top billing. Caviezel comes from the Kevin Costner school of acting which means he rarely emotes. He walks around with a blank expression and delivers his lines in a monotone. Perhaps thats an accurate representation of Coach Ladouceurs personality. Nevertheless theres too little energy in the performance which could have used a little more R. Lee Ermy and a little less Mr. Rogers. Laura Dern Michael Chiklis and Clancy Brown represent the films other veteran talent. Chiklis with his strong screen presence steals almost every scene he shares with Caviezel. Laura Dern has the thankless role of the supporting wife and Clancy Brown is the bullying father who wants his son to succeed so he can bask in the reflected glory. When it comes to movies about high school sports Hoosiers and Friday Night Lights remain touchstones that When the Game Stands Tall doesnt come close to reaching. Its inspirational moments come across as obvious watered-down copies of scenes from Rudy and a dozen similar films. Theres probably a good story to be found within the text but the narrative boxes it in. Complexity isnt desirable. When the Game Stands Tall is too intent upon tweaking our emotions that it loses sight of some potentially powerful issues about hero worship and how the pressure to succeed can be damaging. (To the extent that it addresses these subjects theyre clumsily handled.) Some viewers may react well to this material. Others will find themselves containing their gag reflexes.

In this fact-based tale of the trials and tribulations of Northern Californias De La Salle Spartans football team which had its historic 151-win streak suddenly and tragically interrupted in 2004 Jim Caviezel plays Bob Ladouceur the coach of infinite patience wisdom and caring who despite having a heart attack still managed to guide his emotional players to victory and maturity amid upheaval and self-doubt. ""Winning a lot of games is doable"" he says early on. ""Teaching kids theres more to life thats hard."" How does he do it? He has team meetings where he encourages his kids to stand up and read out their ""commitment cards"" in which they talk about what they want to achieve both athletically and personally. He teaches religion classes and asks his players to learn humility (De La Salle is a private Catholic academy.) He makes his players walk out onto the field holding hands which freaks out opposing teams. In other words coach isnt channeling Knute Rockne; hes channeling a higher power. This is Caviezel after all the nobly suffering Jesus of The Passion of the Christ but perhaps even more important the quiet caring battlefield angel of Terrence Malicks The Thin Red Line his breakthrough role. The effortless spirituality that Malick captured in Caviezel is once again evident in When the Game Stands Tall. But here its become inert unchanging -- not unlike the overly reverential film around it.A Despite some obligatory talk about Ladouceurs not always being there for his kids and his wife (played by Laura Dern here also reduced to a worshipful gaze) this is a character who is mostly infallible. His initial challengesA -- not just the heart attack but also the shocking murder of a star player who was headed to collegeA -- come off as temporary blips the spiritual questioning they prompt all too brief. As De La Salles team recovers from its early-season losses the film makes its way through the season giving us glimpses of Coach Ladouceurs inspirational speeches He always knows the right things to say the right advice to give. In one of the films more engaging scenes he takes his players to a Veterans Administration Medical Center where they can interact with patients whove lost limbs and are struggling to just live ordinary lives -- so that these kids can understand the true nature of loss. The lesson is learned but the dramas not there. Nothing has really built up to this moment and nothing builds from it.A Thats not entirely true. When the Game Stands Tall does build to some excellent football scenes particularly near the end as the Spartans face off against some intimidating rivals including one team considered bigger and better than they are. Full of feats of physical heroism -- a testament in the films vision to the players dedication to one another instead of to the game or to their own glory -- these scenes involve us in ways that much of the rest of the film refuses to.A The movie knows it too. Thats probably why it tries to give us some additional drama via the starting running backs (Alexander Ludwig) conflicted relationship to his overzealous gung-ho father (Clancy Brown). Its a conflict that feels welded on and never really registers as a real threat because the father isnt representative of anything Hes a straw man -- a lone jerk in a world thats uniformly supportive of these players and this team.A If movies have taught us one thing its that inspiration and victory particularly in sports is often cathartic built out of mistakes and pain. Thats the movie version of course not the real-life version. When Al Pacino gives that remarkable ""Lifes a game of inches"" speech in (the totally fictional) Any Given Sunday it becomes a confessional -- he voices both his own and his players need for redemption. Yes its a cliche but its a good cliche Without it all you have is a manual. The real-life story behind When the Game Stands Tall sounds amazing. But for all its exciting sports scenes the movie version falls flat as drama.

Given the tagline for When the Game Stands Tall why must an extraordinary story beget such an ordinary film? In isolation its too earnest a question to ask of a late-summer big-studio feel-good sports drama in 2014. This is no more than a popcorn flick that ticks off all the right boxes to satisfy as many as possible - and thats okay. The larger world of sports filmmaking in 2014 however is documentary-dominated and reaching levels of sophistication unseen just half a decade ago when Sandra Bullock won an Oscar for the rather traditional football story The Blind Side. So as moviegoers and sports fans grow more discerning about what they consume there should be no excuse for shoddy treatments of our beloved pastimes in the near future.The source material for When the Game Stands Tall seems rich with detail The movie is adapted from the 408-page book of the same name by Neil Hayes a sportswriter who covered Californias De La Salle Spartans high-school football team during their unprecedented 151-game winning streak. The 12-year ironman feat is no spoiler as viewers are dropped into the penultimate moments of win No. 151 in December 2003. What follows are the hardships and redemption that in the case of this true story comes after coach Bob Ladouceur suffers a heart attack a graduating player is gunned down and inevitably losing a few games.But whatever nuance that could be derived from the Spartans unique emotional hurdles is rendered generic by archetypal subplots worthy of a drinking game Theres the son of the coach who always needed a parent but instead got a coach; the hotshot receiver who is burdened by an aggressive obsessive football father; the underprivileged college-bound prospect who wont leave his sick mother; the lovable giant of a defensive tackle; the talented rookie in need of an attitude adjustment; even a Rudy-esque benchwarmer who punches above his weight in a pivotal moment.Jim Caviezel as coach Ladouceur doesnt get much to work with the script reducing the man to a two-dimensional motivational speaker awash in ""theres no I in Team"" platitudes. (One also cant help but picture Caviezels most famous role when he recites Luke 638 to the team.)Laura Dern is the highlight as the coachs wife. While Bev is no more than a supportive partner - and the only significant female character - Derns trademark affability will have her swimming in affecting mother-figure roles for years to come.How fascinating it would be to see the real-life coach Ladouceur and his players as interview subjects. In fact you can. There have been two documentaries made about the Spartans Perfect Effort (2007) an independent film and 151 The Greatest Streak (2004) an ESPN production scripted by the sportswriter Hayes.Are these must-watch documentaries? Judging from the grainy clips played against the credits of When the Game Stands Tall it seems safe to say no.But imagine a documentary about the Spartans made today. Thanks to the launch of ESPNs 30 for 30 project in 2009 scores of accomplished filmmakers have used the format - and Disneys money - to tell well-crafted stories with blockbuster production values. (The premiere episode was Kings Ransom Friday Night Lights director Peter Bergs take on Wayne Gretzkys trade from the Edmonton Oilers.)There is undoubtedly a trove of Spartans footage still to be unearthed with a bit of effort interviews newscasts game footage team photos - when you do something as extraordinary as win 151 straight games this millennium you dont go unnoticed.That effort wouldnt go unnoticed either. In the YouTube era the modern sports fan marvels at found footage of their favourite teams. They devour multiscreen live-streams of nightly games and check social media for real-time updates from players themselves. A realistic riveting documentary about the Spartans might not have the mass appeal of a fictional account but it would not be as niche an affair that such a production might have been mere years earlier. The inspirational sports film is certainly not dead as evidenced by the success of Moneyball in 2011. But that production took a Herculean writing effort from Aaron Sorkin and A-list acting from Brad Pitt to earn its Oscar nominations.In the case of When the Game Stands Tall telling the true story would have gone a long way to capturing what being inspired by a true story never could.

"Review When the Game Stands Tall is disingenuous and patronizing - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review When the Game Stands Tall is disingenuous and patronizing When the Game Stands Tall Tracy Bennett / TriStar Pictures Jim Caviezel Alexander Ludwig and Michael Chiklis in the movie ""When the Game Stands Tall."" Jim Caviezel Alexander Ludwig and Michael Chiklis in the movie ""When the Game Stands Tall."" (Tracy Bennett / TriStar Pictures) Robert Abele Jim Caviezel fails to capture Coach Bob Ladouceurs soulfulness in When the Game Stands Tall A true tale of high school football achievement becomes a strained by-the-numbers grab bag of uplift in the Christian sports drama ""When the Game Stands Tall.""At the small California Catholic high school De La Salle Coach Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caviezel) instills brotherhood over personal glory and perfect effort over winning at all costs. The result a record-setting streak of 151 straight victories. The movie focuses on the streaks end in 2003 -- two straight losses yikes -- and as you might imagine director Thomas Carter and writer Scott Marshall Smith (adapting a book about the team) struggle to make us care for a golden squad that isnt exactly an underdog. This is where the personal side dramas -- coachs heart attack a students tragic death a star players overbearing father -- are meant to imbue a sense of adversity but the effect is too diffuse the acting too overwrought and Carters direction too narratively restless to have any emotional effect.Caviezel meanwhile is too stiff to get at Ladouceurs soulfulness readily apparent in an end-credits video clip. After two hours of football-driven story being told ""Its not about the football"" at the end seems disingenuous and patronizing especially when tallying the potential brain damage from all the movie-glorified hitting. For that intersection between sports and manhood youre better off binge-watching the more effortlessly inspiring ""Friday Night Lights.""------------""When the Game Stands Tall.""

"When the Games Stands Tall cliched football biopic fumbles review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesWhen the Games Stands Tall cliched football biopic fumbles review When the Game Stands Tall is a cliched biopic of California high school football coach Bob Ladouceur starring The Passion of the Christs Jim Caviezel.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Aug. 21 2014When the Game Stands TallStarring Jim Caviezel Laura Dern Michael Chiklis Alexander Ludwig SerDarius Blain and Stephan James. Directed by Thomas Carter. 115 minutes. Opening Friday at GTA theatres. PGHigh school football can be described as a religion in many parts of America. Sappily melodramatic When the Game Stands Tall skips the middle man and blends both in a weak-willed cliched biopic of California coach Bob Ladouceur.Jim Caviezel (Jesus in Mel Gibsons The Passion of the Christ) whispers his way through the film as Ladouceur a performance so low key he appears close to nodding off. Or perhaps thats just us.Article Continued BelowLadouceurs unconventional coaching methods with the De La Salle High School Spartans football team were not about winning rather building responsible men who were true to their word and loyal to each other.Michael Chiklis and Jim Caviezel (centre left and right) coach the De La Salle High School Spartans in When the Game Stands Tall.Those lessons translated into the team walking onto the field hand-in-hand in a display of ""Spartans for life"" brotherhood at the start of each game something we are told instilled fear in their opponents. Fear of wetting their pants with laughter seems more likely.Yet the scene where the weeping players are overcome with grief isnt at the funeral of a slain teammate but in a locker room after they lose a game.Losing wasnt something the Spartans were even familiar with having basked in the longest unbroken years-long winning streak in American sports history with 151 games. Coach Ladouceur whose grandest show of emotion comes when he burns burgers on the grill quietly reminds the guys that the streak was never their goal. Try telling a bunch of teenage boys -- even these soda-swilling virginity-promising Spartans -- that winning isnt everything. Its all about the perfect effort.Aided by assistant coach Terry (Michael Chiklis a welcome emotional presence next to Caviezel) and wife Bev (Laura Dern the true moral centre of the piece) Ladouceur is devoted to the work of turning out well-rounded men on the football field while teaching passages from the Bible in his religious studies class. Ladouceur suddenly suffers a heart attack -- the coach duly chastised for smoking. But worse the team seems to have lost its mission focusing on gridiron glory rather than the off-the-field lessons the coach hopes to instill along with scripture verses about rewards for the humble.Their cockiness costs them and the Spartans experience their first loss a portent of more troubles ahead for the tree-lined suburban community where the white kids live which contrasts with the homes of black players (cue the hip-hop soundtrack).After a random shooting outside a raucous house party claims the life of star player T.K. Kelly (Stephan James) the coach delivers a soft-spoken eulogy his head framed in back-lit stained glass. The Spartans none of whom we feel much connection to even by the halfway part of the movie may not be able to rally to win again for T.K.Can the team come back? Will Ladouceurs son (Matthew Daddario) ever learn how to catch the football? Will Chris Ryan (Vancouvers Alexander Ludwig of TVs Vikings) break the record for career touchdowns? Will that make his creepily and violently demanding father Mickey (Clancy Brown of The Shawshank Redemption) back off?Director Thomas Carter (Coach Carter) goes about his task with all the subtlety of a blacksmith working at his anvil. When the Spartans face 100F temperatures on the field its talked about as often as the score in the play-by-play along with repeated shots of a thermometer. As for the on-field action when Carter avoids trickery the on-field shots are realistic and the play exciting. But he often opts for tight sped-up camerawork heightened by often-excessive crunching and thudding sound effects.The latest from Sonys faith-based imprint Affirm Films (Heaven is for Real Moms Night Out Soul Surfer) When the Game Stands Tall fumbles in several ways failing to make enough of a connection to convey its inspirational message.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Credit Tracy Bennett/TriStar Pictures You get Bible verses. You get platitudes. And in the football movie ""When the Game Stands Tall"" you get an overeager Foley artist who makes every physical contact on the gridiron sound like an explosion. On the other hand you get Jim Caviezel who from time to time makes you want to be a high school coach in your next life.Mr. Caviezel plays Bob Ladouceur a California coach who in real life took his team to an astounding 12-season 151-game winning streak beginning in the 1990s. Not far into the film the streak is broken with a humiliating loss and Coach Lad (everyone pronounces his last name LAD-uh-sur) has to teach his young men all kinds of character-building lessons.Thomas Carter the director whips us into a frenzy during the big winning-again-is-everything game as all sports underdog movies must. But in the end the only real impact is limited to a few scenes the sudden violent death of one player; Coach Lads speech at the funeral; and a private speech delivered by Coach Lads wife (Laura Dern wearing glasses) at home afterward. Even she never seems to have had an original thought pleading at one point ""Spend as much time with your family as you do the team."" ""When the Game Stands Tall"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Murder and cigarette use.

Rating PG (thematic material a scene of violence and brief smoking). BOTTOM LINE Worthwhile messages of teamwork and sacrifice but the stern humorless tone might make you tune out. CAST Jim Caviezel Michael Chiklis Laura Dern LENGTH 155 Winning isnt everything but its certainly the reason most people know De La Salle High School in Concord California. From 1992 to 2004 the Catholic schools football team the Spartans sustained an astounding 12-season 151-game run that locals called simply ""the streak."" ""When the Game Stands Tall"" Thomas Carters film about the Spartans focuses not on the streak however but its end. ""Dont let the game define who you are"" coach Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caviezel) tells his team. ""Let the way you live your lives do that."" Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Based on the book by Neil Hayes ""When the Game Stands Tall"" is unusual among sports movies for valuing teamwork brotherhood and sacrifice (and not merely paying lip-service to them). Ladouceur a onetime religious studies teacher could have made a mint by defecting to a major university. ""Thats not what I do"" he tells his wife Bev (Laura Dern). Instead he taught teenage athletes to value effort and dedication not results until he retired in 2013. ""When the Game Stands Tall"" undermines these noble sentiments by delivering them in a stern humorless sanctimonious tone. Caviezel who played the title role in ""The Passion of the Christ"" turns Ladouceur into another martyr-like figure. Joyless morose almost tortured the coach treats giddy fans like moneylenders and elated players like Judases. Only when his flock suffers does he come alive stepping between running back Chris Ryan (Alexander Ludwig) and his abusive father (Clancy Brown) or speaking at the funeral of real-life linebacker Terrence Kelly (Stephan James) murdered just days before entering the University of Oregon. Many of this movies characters are fictional and its pivotal moment -- a high-stakes game against Californias national champions Long Beach Polytechnic -- has been so drastically reimagined that it now bears no relation to the real event. (Full disclosure This miffed reviewer is a third-generation Poly alum.) Overall ""When the Game Stands Tall"" feels like a post-loss locker-room speech meaningful but less than inspirational. 240 MoviesWhen the Game Stands Tall trailer PLOT A winning high-school football team learns what it means to lose. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG (thematic material a scene of violence and brief smoking) CAST Jim Caviezel Michael Chiklis Laura Dern LENGTH 155 BOTTOM LINE Worthwhile messages of teamwork and sacrifice but the stern humorless tone might make you tune out.

Thats the message of the fact-based ""When the Game Stands Tall"" a by-the-book sports drama based on the storied De La Salle Spartans the high school football team whose 151-game winning streak achieved between 1992 and 2003 remains a national record. But rather than explaining how this private Catholic school in Concord Calif. and its coach Bob Ladouceur achieved this remarkable feat ""Game"" is more interested in what happened after the streak ended. As the movie opens in late 2003 the Spartans are about to win their 12th straight state championship. Yet when they do the victory is not received with a sense of gratitude humility or surprise but with the inevitability of a foregone conclusion. Then Ladouceur -- known as Coach Lad and played by Jim Caviezel with a tight-jawed stoicism that makes his Bible-thumping character disappointingly dull -- has a heart attack a star player (Stephan James) meets a tragic fate and the team loses the first game of the 2004 season. Their golden world it seems has come to an end. How the Spartans -- the individual players the team as a whole and the coach -- come back from these setbacks provides the substance of the movie whose moral is encapsulated in Coach Lads locker-room philosophy articulated ad nauseam Winning is less important than the ""perfect effort."" By that standard alone ""When the Game Stands Tall"" is a less than vigorous attempt to win over anyone besides the most die-hard consumers of sports cliches. How hard for example did screenwriter Scott Marshall Smith (whose script is based on a book by Neil Hayes) wrack his brain to come up with such lines as ""Its no longer about who the bigger faster stronger players are; its about who plays with more heart."" That sideline platitude familiar to anyone who has ever listened to a postgame interview with an athlete coach fan or color commentator is a mere drop in a Gatorade barrel of athletic bromides that are dumped over the heads of the audience during this film which as you might expect all comes down to one play. The fact that the audio mysteriously dropped out during the final two minutes of a preview screening mattered not a whit. The conclusion plays out like a kind of dumb show performed by helmeted mimes. Who needs to hear the climax when youve seen it a dozen times before? Whats more the blatant product placement by Dicks Sporting Goods whose brand and logo are splashed all over the movie -- including one scene just outside a store with characters carrying full shopping bags -- goes beyond unsubtle commercialism to distasteful pandering. Of course ""Game"" tries to be about more than football as all of these movies do. There are racial class and economic tensions between some of the teams black and white players including the coachs son (Matthew Daddario). He like his mother (Laura Dern) has issues with the emotionally distant coach. Accusations of cheating also crop up as does the theme of graceful losing although these subplots are ancillary to the movies main thrust. That would be the drive toward the goal line. Honor humility and that most overworked of organs -- heart -- all get to play a few minutes of this ""Game."" But when it comes down to fourth and goal the movie is more about moving the pigskin than moving the audience. Ironically ""When the Game Stands Tall"" isnt about keeping gridiron glory in perspective but about blowing it out of proportion.  1/2 PG. At area theaters.

So it goes in the sturdy crowd-pleasing When the Game Stands Tall a profile in saintliness puffed up from a true story the Northern California Catholic school whose football team enjoyed a 151-game winning streak in the early 2000s. Of course one of the lessons that coach Bob Ladouceur (a stoic Jim Caviezel) teaches on-screen is that winning isnt everything an assertion thats true in real life and even moving in Neil Hayess book about Ladouceur but seems ridiculous in a movie that only exists because those De La Salle High School teams won so often. Here where each football scene is juiced with Hollywood music and stunt work Coachs homilies play like a porn star stopping mid-thrust to tell us what really matters is the love in your heart. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - As the movie tells it Ladouceur stuffed his student jocks with life lessons and Bible verses inspiring them always to make the ""perfect effort"" rather than aspire to something so earthly as victory. (He also beseeches them to hit harder at the snap just as Jesus would have.) Scott Marshall Smiths script reduces to a confused parable the genuinely fascinating story of the real Ladouceurs ambivalence toward that streak -- and a bigger-than-football tragedy his team faced in 2004. Unlike the telling in Hayess book theres little arc here to what happens off the field. The coach realizes in the first act after a health scare that he has spent too much time on football and too little with his family. (Laura Dern nods sympathetically stuck in one of those wife roles that demands the actress do nothing but egg on a husband.) Still he keeps on with the job. His team suffers some setbacks but everything is righted in a couple training montages and Ladouceur never once experiences a moment of doubt ... or generates one of drama. Film Details When the Game Stands Tall RatingPG GenreDrama Running Time115 More Info Trailer Caviezel starred in The Passion of the Christ and in one scene here hes haloed in light like a Close Encounters alien disgorged from the mother ship. His Ladouceur seems to haunt our world without really being of it and he always seems to have a great truth in mind that he will make everyone around him find for themselves. That might work in teaching but it makes him a frustrating protagonist especially since Caviezel in a close-lipped performance so rarely connects to the other actors.By the end the big question is not whether his team will win but whether as it does so will the players sufficiently honor his teachings. At a low point talking to God Coach declares that its wrong for any of us ever to wonder why lives so often get wrecked by inscrutable tragedy ""We cannot ask these questions"" he says ""because to ask them is to question your divine benevolence."" When the Game Stands Tall often reminds us that ""Coach Lad"" is teaching his athletes to be men rather than pros; is it healthy to instruct them that its a mortal sin ever to question a figure of righteous authority? The movie is more effective as sports fantasy than as theology. Its especially compelling if you favor highly dramatized football action where each tackle sounds like a wooden ship crashing into an iceberg. Those sequences are exciting enough to win over sympathetic audiences and for those unmoved by the action itself theres always a sportscaster on hand jabbering about how each play connects to the movies themes and subplots. As in Ron Howards Rush this on-the-fly narration relieves the filmmakers of having to communicate effectively through well-composed and sharply edited shots and its easy to imagine this as the future of commercial movies -- maybe Vin Diesel can summarizes the Fast 7 chases for us as we watch. Some of the nonconcussive stuff works. Director Thomas Carter elicits ace performances from several of the young men in the cast especially Stephan James and SerDarius Bain. Both play graduating seniors who yearn for their bright futures and burn with pride for what theyve accomplished. Their characters schlep to De La Salle from a predominately African-American neighborhood in Richmond California. Their home lives are affectingly painted in several early scenes a pleasant surprise in a great-white coach flick for the faith-based crowd. Only one of the three principal black players on De La Salles team is depicted as the flashy showboat; Jessie Usher suffers the indignity of having to shout ""Ah heck no"" Refreshingly none of the three needs the coach to save them. (The white kids get routine father-son drama that will one day afford TNT viewers the chance to make a sandwich.)The film is most interesting when Carter and company break convention. To make a point about determination and teamwork the coach and his boys take a field trip to a VA hospital to meet with recovering veterans many of whom have lost limbs and are working through rigorous rehabilitation. The sequence is moving even as its hokey -- its rare to see the human toll of our Mideast wars in a Hollywood film yet the moral use of that toll here feels off. I dont expect the De La Salle squad to run off and enlist or to start picketing U.S. military engagements but shouldnt the suffering of our soldiers inspire something deeper than the will to play harder at a game the Lord doesnt want you to want to win? Or is that one of those questions its a sin to ask?When the Game Stands Tall feels as if it will connect with the audiences at which its aimed. If it doesnt and the movie doesnt make whatever money the studio is expecting Im sure everyone involved will get hearty you-did-your-best hugs from the executives What matters is effort not success Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Alan Scherstuhl Follow studiesincrap Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 755 a.m. MST August 22 2014Thomas Carters film follows what happens after the longest winning streak in American history comes to an end. The stories are interesting but Jim Caviezel is too low-key as the coach.Jim Caviezel in a scene from ""When The Game Stands Tall.""(Photo Mandalay Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 3 starsThe filmmakers wisely begin the film at the end of the winning streak.The football footage is outstanding.Caviezels performance is so underplayed it mutes the films impact.There is nothing particularly compelling about perfection.Not in a narrative sense anyway. ""When the Games Stands Tall"" is the story of the De La Salle High School football team which won 151 consecutive games from 1992 to 2004. Had director Thomas Carter whose film is based on the book by Neil Hayes simply chronicled the Streak as it was known it would have been one win after another.We like underdogs. Its kind of tough to make an inspirational film about a team thats killing every school it plays.Instead the movie begins at the end. After winning yet another state title the Spartans lost the opening game of the 2004 season. Carters film looks at the team as this group of players start over and its better for it.AZCENTRALDirector Thomas Carter breaks down GameNot great mind you. Carter has some trouble navigating a shift in perspective from one story to the next but the stories are interesting enough to cover that. Whats more troublesome is the performance of Jim Caviezel as Bob Ladouceur the Spartans coach. Theres no question that a soft-spoken person can be a great leader but Caviezel underplays Ladouceur to the point that you wonder how the players could even hear him much less be inspired by him.Theres plenty of story here. Graduating seniors ponder their college choices; not all will escape tragedy. Ladouceur will face challenges to his health as well as offers from big universities; his wife (Laura Dern) patiently helps him sort things out while his son (Matthew Daddario) cant hold onto the ball.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixMost entertaining if disturbing is the quest of Chris Ryan (Alexander Ludwig) to break the California record for career touchdowns. Hes not that into it but his father Mickey (Clancy Brown) is obsessed clearly living out his own thwarted dreams through his son. Mickeys passion is obscenely misguided but at least its there.Having Michael Chiklis as Terry Eidson Ladouceurs assistant coach on the sideline is both a blessing -- he brings an animated intensity to the practices and games -- and a curse as it draws more attention to Caviezels muted performance.The game footage is outstanding very realistic. Even when the outcome of games is never in question -- which is often -- its still exciting to watch.Carter makes an interesting choice at the end of the film. As the credits roll he inserts actual footage of the real Ladouceur addressing his team including some of the speeches depicted by the actors in the film. The coachs demeanor and delivery practically define the term ""quiet intensity.""Caviezels version of the coach settles for simply ""quiet."" Though it has plenty to recommend it ""When the Game Stands Tall"" misses the other half of that equation.Review When the Game Stands Tall 3 starsDirector Thomas Carter.Cast Jim Caviezel Alexander Ludwig Michael Chiklis.Rating PG for thematic material a scene of violence and brief smoking.AZCENTRALWhen the Game Stands Tall (2014) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsReach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Comments click to enlarge When the Game Stands Tall Video Rated PG  115 minutes  2014 Playing both sides against the middle this fact-based drama about high school football coach Bob Ladouceur and his De La Salle Spartans makes a commendable effort to invest the inspirational sports movie with some deeper meaning but simultaneously labors to keep all the genre cliches firmly in place. Ladouceur led the Concord California team through a record 151-game winning streak from 1992 through 2004; the movie chronicles the string of defeats that followed before the Spartans roar back with their hard-fought 2001 victory against Long Beach Polytechnic. (Yeah I know thats achronological but I told you its fact-based.) Along the way the jocks learn that teamwork is more important than individual glory and sports is about building character not muscles. Of course what really builds character is losing something the Spartans seldom did. Thomas Carter directed; with Jim Caviezel Michael Chiklis and Laura Dern. By J.R.

A high school football team overcomes loss. Director Thomas Carter (154). PG Violence. Area theaters. A football gridiron may be rectangular but this family movie sure is square. This fact-based tale is about the Richmond Calif. Spartans. When first glimpsed they have the longest winning streak in high school football -- 151 games -- but they dont realize that its tearing them apart. Despite the best efforts of Coach Ladoucer (Jim Caviezel) and his assistant (Michael Chiklis doing his best Jason Alexander impression) this successful team rising from a struggling blue-collar town has become complacent. They expect success but have forgotten that excellence means more than trophies. Jim Caviezel and Alexander Ludwig (r.) in When the Game Stands Tall (Tracy Bennett) Actual trouble arrives when ""Coach Lad"" suffers a heart attack and a recent grad is shot in a mixup on the wrong side of town. As a new season starts the Spartans lose the first game -- and it seems the magic touch. But it may come with a silver lining. Only by not caring about victory can they be true champions. If this logic seems a bit muddled the movie disguises it by keeping things moving at running-back speed. Theres an endless barrage of motivational buzzwords and training montages. When Coach Lad isnt pelting the team with platitudes hes leading them in Bible study or taking them to a VA hospital to learn the true meaning of sacrifice. Jim Caviezel (center right) and Michael Chiklis (center left) are coaches in When the Game Stands Tall. (Tracy Bennett) Caviezel (""The Passion of the Christ"") interestingly chooses to portray his humble self-sacrificing leader of boys-to-men in a quiet key. So instead of rousing speeches we get incomplete passes. But ""Hoosiers"" this aint. The redemptive final game has some nice plays and bone-crunching sound effects but no grit. Ultimately its a ho-hum bromide-filled production undeserving of a victory dance.

Photo Tracy Bennett Image 3 of 3 When Game Stands Tall review drama on De La Salle streak 1 / 3 Back to Gallery When the Game Stands Tall Sports drama. Starring Jim Caviezel Michael Chiklis Laura Dern and Matthew Daddario. Directed by Thomas Carter. (PG. 115 minutes.) Outside of humans invaded by body snatchers and presidents whose nations are threatened by an asteroid has there been a more stoic big screen performance than Jim Caviezel as Bob Ladouceur in ""When the Game Stands Tall""? The De La Salle High football coach and his Concord teams struggles after ending a 151-game win streak are grist for a surprisingly moody and very solid sports film. More in the tone of the big screen ""Friday Night Lights"" than ""Rudy"" or ""The Blind Side"" it succeeds as mainstream entertainment without relying on a conventional storybook framework. Based on a book by former Contra Costa Times sports writer Neil Hayes the film contains quite a few Hollywood compromises - including a couple of main characters who are flat-out made up to heighten the third-act drama. And yet the movie remains relatable bypassing most of the teams historic athletic achievements and exploring how champions deal with loss. Shepherding the project with confidence is director Thomas Carter whose experience with high school sports entertainment dates back to the late 1970s when he played Hayward in TVs ""The White Shadow."" Carter also directed ""Coach Carter"" which like ""When the Game Stands Tall"" spends time on the tough streets of Richmond. ""Game"" is the more nuanced of the two movies and by far a better piece of cinema. The film begins at the end of De La Salles 2003 season the last in the Spartans unbeaten run showing both the spoils and the burden of what was simply called ""The Streak."" After an inevitable loss an unfair share of that burden falls on one group of athletes including Ladouceurs son Danny (Matthew Daddario) and fictitious team leader Chris Ryan (Alexander Ludwig). The coach faces additional challenges; health issues distance from his family and the tragedy of real-life De La Salle murder victim Terrance Kelly. Caviezels portrayal of Ladouceur borders on unintentional humor; for the first 38 minutes before he breaks into a smile during a barbecue he appears to be playing a Terminator. Tensions between father and son seem forced and illogical. A subplot involving Chris Ryan and his ridiculously overbearing dad is included only so the movie can have a villain. And its a tough to choose the more distracting product placement Nike or Dicks Sporting Goods. (Dicks actually winds its way into the plot but we see several Nike swooshes at a funeral. So well call it a tie.) But the greater narrative always remains on track often leading to unexpected places. Carter and his solid film crew use handheld camera techniques during the dramatic scenes then film the on-field action with a crisp coherence. The players at times seem to be making superhuman moves as if theyre Madden NFL characters being played by a kid with a remote control. But theres no shaky cam or quick edits to dilute the moment whether its a well-earned victory or painful loss. (One note for Bay Area prep football fans The bulk of the movie was filmed in New Orleans so dont bother looking for yourself in the crowd.) ""When the Game Stands Tall"" ventures beyond the constraints of a simple feel-good story. The Kelly subplot is handled respectfully sticking more closely to the facts than other parts of the film. A visit by the team to a Veterans Administration hospital is a particularly successful scene simultaneously stoking audience emotions while offering some grittier-than-usual sights by PG-rated high school sports film standards. Many sports movies include scenes where coaches say that winning isnt everything ... and then they win everything. ""When the Game Stands Tall"" spends its entire 115 minutes proving that statement true. (One small accuracy gripe for Bay Area-born crowds No high school house party in Richmond would have been playing Montell Jordan in 2003. Mafiosos maybe. The Frontline definitely. But not ""This is How We Do It."") Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet When The Game Stands Tall the latest inspirational extracurricular-activity story from director Thomas Carter (Coach Carter Save The Last Dance) offers a welcome tweak on the underdog sports formula. Its central characters--the players and coaches of the De La Salle Spartans high school football team--arent scrappy nobodies making an unlikely bid for a championship trophy but top-ranked elites struggling to rebuild their confidence after losing their first game in 12 years. It is in other words a movie about humility a theme Scott Marshall Smiths script approaches mostly in religious terms complete with chapter-and-verse quotations and a Job figure who comes in the form of future University Of Oregon recruiting bust Cam Colvin (SerDarius Blain). Fittingly the movies qualities are modest ones Its largely underplayed and hoorah-free with head coach Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caviezel) rarely raising his voice above a soft indoor murmur; its slick-looking--full of diffusion filters inky shadows and artificial lens flares--but hardly ostentatious; and its Christian overtones feel true to life with coachspeak (""perfect effort"") and the New Testament serving as a lingua franca for the characters who come from different denominations and have differing social backgrounds and values. Of course the problem with this kind of modesty is that its difficult to get excited about it; its easier to appreciate what When The Games Stands Tall doesnt do than it is to admire what it does. Ladouceurs restrained air makes him a credibly paternal leader but it also makes him emotionally opaque which wouldnt be a problem if he werent continually telling his players not to bottle up their emotions. Late in the movie when he speaks of his failings as a husband and father it comes across as disingenuous--not on the part of his character but on the part of the film which mostly avoids emotional tension and argument. (The one exception is Mickey Ryan the archetypal overbearing sports dad played by Clancy Brown.)Douglas Sirk definitive stylist of the Hollywood melodrama famously joked that ""life is the most melodramatic story of all"" and When The Game Stands Tall--which is set in 2004 when the real-life Spartans not only lost their winning streak but also had to deal with Ladouceurs health problems and the murder of a star player--is full of turns that would be called convoluted if they were wholly fictional. It seems as though in order to restrain the storys inherent melodrama Carter and Smith have erred on the side of too much modesty. For all the pains the movie takes to explain why someone shouldnt play football--to win to be a star to defeat others--it never bothers to explain why someone should play the game. Its a collection of well-intentioned absences with no defining presence to speak of.

Photo TriStar Pictures MOVIE REVIEW When the Game Stands Tall Running time 115 minutes. Rated PG (violence smoking adult situations). At the Empire the Orpheum the Lincoln Square others. When the Game Stands Tall"" is nearly as good as the average episode of TVs ""Friday Nights Lights"" which makes it better than most movies and one of the better sports films of recent years. Patient and low-key ""When the Game Stands Tall"" looks at a hotshot high school football team that after a 151-game win streak lost its mojo via off-field crises. Jim Caviezel wields the clipboard as soft-spoken Bob Ladouceur whose De La Salle Spartans grow worryingly cocky during their win streak and forget how many times the letter ""I"" appears in the word ""team."" His message Its not about the football its about growing up. So its a veterans hospital not the gridiron that provides the backdrop to the key scene of the film Meeting amputees teaches the teens what theyve forgotten. One player says sometimes his legs hurt so much that he wishes he couldnt feel them. ""No you dont"" a paralyzed veteran softly chides him. There are warriors and there are warriors. Jim Caviezel coaches Alexander Ludwig from the sidelines.Photo TriStar Pictures A football film suffers from an inherent contradiction that this sincere heartwarming film grapples with more honestly than most. True theres more to life than football but then again nobody wants to watch a movie about studying for your SATs. One minute during the game against the most fearsome opponent of the year Coach tells an assistant to put in second-string players if the starters are too beaten-up to continue ""I dont care if it costs us the game"" he says. And yet when a player says hes not leaving the game except on a stretcher director Thomas Carter doesnt realize hes negating the moral. Nevertheless in a film that whose earnestness and occasional Bible references have bought it throwaway status from its distributor Carter proves able to find a fresh way to end a sports movie Not with a big score but with a moment of humility. I call that more satisfying than an 80-yard touchdown.

The religion of high-school football commingles with plain old-fashioned religion in ""When the Game Stands Tall"" an inspirational sports drama (from Sonys inhouse faith-based label Affirm Films) that goes long on rectitudinous sermonizing but comes up short on gridiron thrills or genuine love for the game. Save for a couple of fine performances relegated to the sidelines no one really brings their ""A"" game to this lazily executed late-summer programmer -- a ""Friday Night Lights"" for the Sunday-school crowd graced by little of the storytelling craft and skillful emotional manipulation that have distinguished the recent wave of superior Disney sports pics. After an opening weekend that may see a bump from church-group sales expect ""Game"" to do most of its rushing and passing on home screens. Like most entries in this particular genre ""When the Game Stands Tall"" traffics in the usual tropes of scrappy heroes and come-from-behind victories -- except that in this case the underdogs are more like alpha dogs and they dont go from last to first so much as from first to second and back again. But then theres more to life than just winning -- a mantra the movie announces with such frequency and fervor that if you dont leave the theater with it ringing in your head you should head straight for the nearest ear doctor. When our story begins in the fall of 2003 the De La Salle High School Spartans of tree-lined Concord Calif. are coming to the end of yet another undefeated season that has left them with the longest unbroken winning streak -- 151 games -- in American sports history. But dark clouds loom on the horizon A large chunk of the teams starting lineup is due to graduate in the spring and the underclassmen waiting to take their places seem to lack a certain team spirit. ""The streak was never our goal"" says the Spartans mild-mannered coach Bob Ladouceur (Jim Caviezel) a religious studies teacher at this private Catholic enclave who preaches the gospel of good sportsmanship (with a bit of Luke and Matthew thrown in for good measure) and rarely opens his mouth without some similarly honeyed homily dropping out of it. Its not giving much away to say that De La Salles streak does come to an ignominious end but not before good Coach L. almost meets his maker due to a massive coronary (prefigured in a mark of director Thomas Carters ham-fisted style by multiple closeups of Ladouceurs cigarette stash). Five stents later Ladouceur is good as new but somehow the Spartans mojo isnt quite working. Some of the cocky new players dont seem to understand that theres no ""I"" in ""team"" and everyone is shattered when beloved linebacker Terrance T.K. Kelly (Stephan James) is killed in a random act of urban violence (foreshadowed by risibly cliche images of malt-liquor-swilling revelers bumping and grinding to Montell Jordan). Still ""When the Game Stands Tall"" has already been on the screen for nearly an hour by the time the Spartans finally lose during an away game against a national-championship Seattle team -- the proverbial inciting incident that most screenplay manuals tell you to include no later than page 15. A shot at redemption hovers in the form of a ballyhooed game against a Long Beach team with a 330-pound offensive tackle. But as this sluggish film winds its way toward that inevitable showdown it generates little in the way of rooting interest. In adapting Neil Hayes nonfiction book screenwriter Scott Marshall Smith (""Men of Honor"") and David Zelon (who receives a story credit with Smith) have painted nearly every character into a blandly stereotypical corner whether its the golden-boy running back (Alexander Ludwig) with a hard-driving booster dad (a snarling mustache-twirling Clancy Brown); Ladouceurs own wide-receiver son (Matthew Daddario) on hand mainly to grouse things like ""When I needed a dad I got a coach and now when I need a coach you want to be a dad""; and Ladouceur himself the kind of secular saint who tosses lucrative college coaching offers into the trash bin as if they were yesterdays fish wrap. (Doing by far the best work in the film Michael Chiklis and Laura Dern manage to suggest glimmers of inner lives as respectively Ladouceurs longtime assistant coach and acquiescent wife.) Carter a proficient journeyman director who did a modestly more energetic job with 2005s high-school basketball drama ""Coach Carter"" never seems to get inside the world of the movie. His football scenes lack any visceral bone-crunching impact and when he ventures off the field the movie fails to foster the sense of family and community that drive the best sports dramas. Carters leafy NoCal suburbs and their adjacent war-torn ghettos have all the neighborhood feel of the Warner Bros. backlot. Even a better director though might have been at a loss to solve a problem like Caviezel. When the real Ladouceur appears in documentary footage under the movies end credits he seems a stern but folksy avuncular figure a bit like a more athletic Garrison Keillor. But Caviezel turns him into a dour ascetic who scarcely cracks a smile and suffers profoundly for each of his players who fails to grasp the true meaning of ""Those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will be exalted."" Its a comically self-serious turn but at least its interesting in a way that little else in ""When the Game Stands Tall"" manages to be. It is sometimes said that a great actor can take dross and make it sound like Shakespeare. Here Caviezel takes ""Hoosiers"" and plays it as though he were still nailed to the cross.

Sharon says September 1 2014 at 808 pm The movie was so inspiring and worth while for all generations to see. The message of team work working for someone other than yourself was enjoyable to watch. I had no idea this coach existed and he certainly was the right man for the job of inspiring his team to live better lives. I thought the movie had a storyline and wasnt held together with exploding bombs and dogging bullets. acrobatic leaps and no plot. I told two other people about the movie and they both went to see it and enjoyed it as much as I did............. Reply Orla says August 24 2014 at 649 am Apparently the said ""Critics"" knew nothing about the true story behind the movie who coach Bob is and what his personalities are. What a pity. He just cant accept anything different from his imagination anything with Caviezel in it Reply SavhCaro says August 23 2014 at 1058 am Did you READ the book as research before you saw this movie? You would know that Jim Caviezels take on Coach Lad was perfect. When making a movie about a REAL LIVE PERSON you make it about a real live person.....not a character made up in some writers head. You totally missed the whole point of this movie. It was what Coach Lad did in his own quiet way to instill a sense of responsibility to those around you.....which is sadly lacking in todays society. Love responsibility and respect are powerful motivators. That is what this movie is about......it just happened to be what happened to a real football team and the winning just was a result of what Coach Lad taught these young men. As shown in the movie he chose to stay in the high school setting where he could do the most good for young men.....not a college or NFL team. Money amp; prestige are not everyones goal in life..... Reply Jim Harf says August 23 2014 at 1040 am Agenda driven review offered up by a guy who made up his mind before even seeing the film. Written to appease (and humor) himself and his secularist buddies Foundas reminds his readers that film ""critics"" are often nothing more than political mouthpieces for the liberals they strive to cater to. My guess is that the reviews for any number of Matt Damon ""think pieces"" lead with terms like ""visionary"" and ""genius"" as a way to curry favor with the social classes this dude runs with. With such an obvious dislike for anything outside his own tastes is it any wonder readership for the magazine the guy represents is so low in circulation? Reply Ben Novak says August 22 2014 at 916 am A lot of critics hated ""Top Gun"" too. So much for opinions. Moviegoers should see the film and make individual judgements. Reply Jackie Twodat Jackson says August 22 2014 at 845 am The movie was excellent. The message is beautiful something that this critic seems to miss while trying to be wordy and seems to have a grudge against some of its cast. Maybe he isnt into good positive movies. It seems the critic missed the whole theme of this movie. Sorry movie critic but your wrong on this one. Ask my family positive experience and.they enjoyed it very much. Reply bernadette nickson says August 22 2014 at 724 am Jim Caviezel is certainly still ""Nailed to the cross"" of this ""blandly steriotypical"" anti-christian reviewer.and his rectitudinous sermonizing review. Reply The world can be tough and nasty and people need inspiration says August 21 2014 at 341 pm I hope a lot of folks see the film like it and live better lives because of its message.

Which for its own sake is both good and bad.Its a positive thing that De La Salle High School football coach Bob Ladouceurs message is broadcast loud and clear Great teams are more than the sum of their parts. Play for the man next to you. Never give up. Character counts. Leave it all on the field.Those are borderline cliches to be sure but thats how the football team from the Catholic school in Concord does things. Its an admirable ethos and if record-breaking 151-game win streaks count it works. Its difficult to see this film and if one believes half of what it portrays not feel inspired by how ""Coach Lad"" and his staff spread their collective message.Still from a sports-movie point of view something feels a bit off. Its not the typical claw-your-way-to-top story arc we expect of the best of them. Not that they have to. But De La Salle -- at least in 2004 the year in which the film is set -- started at the top. They were excellent from the get-go and that puts the film at an immediate disadvantage when it comes to winning over an audience. The question then becomes When youre the best and things go south how do the best respond? And is that worthy of an overtly dramatic movie that struggles with credibility? Can being the best and hitting some bumps in the road before regaining the crown inspire moviegoers to root for the so-called comeback?Advertisement Films based on real-life events have mountains to climb that others dont especially when so many of the characters and the people who love them are still around. Even if they accept that a certain amount of ""When the Game Stands Tall"" is hype will moviegoers root for a big comeback when the team in question has to ""overcome"" losing only two games after ""The Streak"" of not losing for 12 years? That would be almost laughable if not for the enormous expectations that come with playing for a program that routinely has perfect seasons. There were some major obstacles to be sure and these are set up early in the story. First theres the temporary loss of Ladouceur who suffers a heart attack shortly after theyve won game No. 151 the 2003 section championship. Then in August 2004 one of their own is tragically shot the day before he leaves for college and just weeks before the 2004 season is to begin. But though compassion-inducing those problems arent necessarily alien to dozens of high school football programs especially in inner cities. So the clawing up is really a matter of clawing back up and its less sympathetic when the team hasnt been an underdog in years. Jim Caviezel as Bob Ladouceur (center right) and Michael Chiklis as Terry Eidson (center left) in When the Game Stands Tall. (Tracy Bennett/Sony Pictures) ( Tracy Bennett ) Ladouceur is played stoically by Jim Caviezel (""The Passion of the Christ"" and TVs ""Person of Interest""). The film follows Ladouceurs quest to build quality young men through disciplined football while battling the demands of time constraints pushy parents outside job offers media pressure health problems and finally a team shocked not only by the shooting death of one of its best but losing two straight games they werent supposed to lose. Yes they lost two whole games. Then again for De La Salle losing twice isnt the same as it might be elsewhere. Caviezel -- who at times sounds a lot like Tom Skerritts character in ""Top Gun"" -- plays a great Coach Lad ... if Coach Lad is indeed silently and constantly dramatic always on-point and absolutely inflexible in his approach even at the cost of massive personal sacrifice. Which makes a great character on film but cant help but make someone wonder how close it comes to reality (and makes it worth sitting through the credits to get a look at the real Ladouceur who seems capable of the occasional smile). The same goes for Laura Dern who is mostly wasted as the coachs wife Bev Ladouceur whose main job seems to be pointing out the obvious to her husband.Heres where I confess to not having the objectivity of other reviewers. I have family who played sports at De La Salle. I grew up knowing lots of people who played for the Spartans. I know people who worked on the movie. I worked with Neil Hayes who wrote the book on which the movie is based. I have been friends with sportswriters who have covered the team and have enjoyed entertaining chats with Terry Eidson (the assistant coach portrayed in a light and funny manner by Michael Chiklis who provides an accurate depiction and provides a much-needed balance to Caviezels intense Ladouceur). I live close enough to the football field to hear the team practice from my yard.And truth be told I found the movie mildly disappointing. And not as someone unhappy about the creative license taken with the storyline or who was chosen to portray the real-life characters. Thats Hollywood. But I walked out of the theater feeling like Id seen an extremely glossy docudrama. That said the football scenes are realistic and full of adrenaline -- the Spartans fatigue and heat issues in a pivotal game are captured well by director Thomas Carter (""Coach Carter"" ""Save the Last Dance""). Also it would be difficult to overstate the inherent drama of Terrance Kelly -- one of the countrys best high school players and seemingly all around good guy -- being killed pretty much randomly the night before he was to escape the nasty streets of Richmond for what many believed would be a slam-dunk successful college career. But beyond the big-picture ideas the film itself struggled to answer its own questions. The classic father-son conflicted subplot involving Ladouceurs son Danny (Matthew Daddario) was obvious and seemed forced to add to the coachs challenges. I kept waiting for difficult star Tayshon Lanear (Jessie Usher) to erupt given his bountiful screen time and the difficulties he supposedly represented. There were a few obvious miscues (the portrayal of the media was beyond ridiculous).Even if the De La Salle High School football program is a great story on its own merits -- and it really is -- the Hollywood treatment doesnt breed the kind of sympathy or interest a feature film requires. To enjoy this film requires the viewer to focus on the positive message -- that theres more to high school football than numbers on a scoreboard. It was obvious De La Salle doesnt need the hype. Yet maybe the message does. Which Coach Ladouceur and the real Spartan insiders would likely have said all along.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/bayareanewsgroup.tonyhicks or Twitter.com/tonyhicks67.WHEN THE GAME STANDS TALL   1/2Rating PG for thematic material a scene of violence and brief smokingCast Jim Caviezel Alexander Ludwig Michael Chiklis Laura Dern Clancy Brown SerDarius Blain Stephan JamesDirector Thomas Carter based on a book by Neil HayesRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Sunnyvale Plans for housing project at Butchers Corner taking shapeRedwood City San Jose man sentenced to 30 days in jail for leading police on chaseRedwood City One dead in Highway 101 crash Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.
