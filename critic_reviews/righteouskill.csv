Comments Righteous Kill Robert De Niro and Al Pacino working together for the first time since Heat (1995) are veteran New York City cops trying to track down a vigilante serial killer. Watching these old pros play longtime buddies is a pleasure especially since theyre together in most scenes. But this thriller by Jon Avnet (88 Minutes) is mostly by the numbers and its surprise ending though effective feels somewhat forced. Avnet explores some dark corollaries between police work and sadomasochism but theyre eventually shunted aside by the plot machinations. With Carla Gugino Curtis Jackson Brian Denehy John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg. 100 min.

(Ken regan) By Jason Matloff Globe Correspondent / September 12 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + Say it aint so Bobby and Al.Much has been made about how Robert De Niro and Al Pacino seem to have stopped caring about making great movies but keep working anyway. As hard as that may be for diehard fans to accept their lackluster performances in director Jon Avnets misbegotten crime thriller ""Righteous Kill"" support the rap.De Niro and Pacino play veteran New York City detectives who are tired of watching criminals get away with rape murder and other heinous acts because of judicial loopholes. Lucky for them the worst of the thugs start showing up dead thanks to an apparently like-minded serial killer who also leaves a poem alongside each corpse. Its as if TVs Dexter failed Poetry 101. Also on the case is a rough-sex-loving crime-scene specialist (Carla Gugino) and two up-and-coming police officers (John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg) who are convinced the killer is a cop.If it sounds interesting it isnt. The script by Russell Gewirtz (""Inside Man"") is convoluted and often silly; an amusing exchange about the cartoon ""Underdog"" ultimately feels like Tarantino lite and Avnet (""Fried Green Tomatoes"") manages to make New York exteriors (the ones that werent filmed in Bridgeport Conn.) appear bland and un-cinematic. De Niro scowls his way through most of the movie and though Pacino starts out strong he ultimately cant restrain himself and hams up the ending. The pairs mythic collaboration in Michael Manns ""Heat"" is a distant memory.Attention Martin Scorsese Paul Thomas Anderson or even Tarantino Please come calling with some juicy comeback or Oscar-worthy part. Because when actors are as great as De Niro and Pacino watching them in a movie like ""Righteous Kill"" is deadly. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

"Righteous Kill | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; righteous-kill ) Righteous Kill (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Righteous Kill is the third movie in which screen icons Robert De Niro and Al Pacino both appear but only the second in which they share screen time. 13 years ago Michael Mann scored a coup by filming the first scene with these two sitting opposite one another. Now director Jon Avnet rather than accepting sloppy seconds has attempted to one-up Mann by having De Niro and Pacino share not only a handful of scenes but pairing them on-screen for almost every scene in a 100-minute motion picture. Unfortunately the hook of having the two Corleones together is just about the only reason to see this otherwise lackluster police thriller. The script and direction are what one might expect from any of a number of similarly written productions that bypass theaters on the expressway to cable and/or DVD. Its only the star power of the leads that accords Righteous Kill the honor of a 2000+ theater release when it deserves a more ignominious fate. Detectives Turk (De Niro) and Rooster (Pacino) have been friends and partners for many years. Their latest case has them hunting a serial killer/vigilante whose victims are violent criminals who get off on technicalities. Neither Turk nor Rooster is terribly motivated to find this man since they sympathize with him. In fact the movies framing device which features De Niro ""confessing"" into a video camera a suggests that he may be the killer. Keeping Turk and Rooster honest are Detectives Perez (John Leguizamo) and Riley (Donnie Wahlberg) who are also working the case. One of the most apparent problems with Righteous Kill is that theres not a lot of story to begin with. We get copious amounts of dialogue between Turk and Rooster but theres not a lot of substance in the words. The ending which includes a revelation that I guess is supposed to be a twist (although savvy viewers will see it coming) is ludicrous and recalls the ridiculous climax to the previous Pacino/Avnet collaboration 88 Minutes. The film also resorts to the weariest of clichA(c)s the bad guy holds the good guy at gun point and explains everything to him. Avnet and screenwriter Russell Gerwitz try their best at misdirection by employing as many red herrings as possible but its really not that difficult to guess where the movie is going. The script simply isnt smart enough to keep viewers guessing unless theyre not paying attention. One of my complaints about Heat was the blandness of the centerpiece De Niro/Pacino scene. One could make the same comment about Righteous Kill. The actors scenes are ordinary and the roles could have been filled by anyone. Neither De Niro nor Pacino does a bad job; they both earn their paychecks. But this will not go down on either of their filmographies as a performance to remember. Theres no intensity. Theyre both in comfortable territory and nothing in the screenplay challenges them to let it all hang out. One could argue that it has been about a decade since either actor has turned in a compelling dramatic performance so perhaps it shouldnt be a surprise that no one will be mentioning Oscars in association with Righteous Kill. Still one cant help but be disappointed that after having overcome the considerable logistical and financial hurdles of bringing these two men together the result is so forgettable. Certainly Avnet must shoulder some of the blame. 88 Minutes showed that he has little feel for thrillers and while Righteous Kill is neither as over-the-top nor as blatantly cheesy the director does nothing to improve upon the tepid material or make it interesting for reasons other than De Niro and Pacino. The actors while not in top form speak their lines with more conviction than those words and phrases deserve. As the film drags into its second hour one wonders what about the script attracted them to this project. This isnt just generic material; its generic material with a dumb ending and the director is a journeyman not a craftsman. For fans of police and crime thrillers Righteous Kill was a much anticipated title on the fall schedule. Its failure to live up to even modest expectations is a blow. Theres nothing righteous to be found here.

Pacino. Together again at last. Well you can stop salivating right this minute because this first reunion for the two key Hollywood actors of their generation since the diner scene in Michael Manns Heat puts them in the sort of schlocky crime flick which would have gone straight to video had it not been for their involvement. Aptly cast as two weary NYPD detectives on the verge of retirement the two play to a good cop/bad cop template as Al (a sprightly 68) delivers concerned emollience and Bob (a fit 65) parades his anger-management issues in the face of a serial-killer investigation where evidence suggests a police insider enacting their own brand of justice on sundry scumbags. As the procedural moves along entirely functional lines inserts of grainy faux-video footage shows Bob confessing to said slayings...Forget any pretensions to moral complexity this dispiriting affair is more a matter of tired plot-spinning vainly trying to disguise a blatantly predictable final twist. It offers the two stars plenty of screen-time together yet gives them only low-voltage banter to work with. Admittedly theyve both been worse; Pacino tones down the windmilling arms and volatile intonation while De Niro produces some variation on his recent rictus smirk but theres little here apart from a few grace notes and sly asides to suggest former heavyweights at work. They look like jobbing veteran actors picking up another payday in some routine cop filler and Avnets busily clueless direction offers them and the clunky writing little help. Pacino. De Niro.

It was terrible.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 27 2008JohnFeaturedI am a huge Pacino fan (got everything he has done on video/dvd) but I could not take this movie seriously as the two leads were too old for the parts they were playing as was Brian Dennehy who played their boss. I am not being ageist I am 52 but seeing DeNiro having rough sex with his much younger lover and Pacino with his motor bike and a couple of leggy blondes just to prove how virile they were was a bit sad. The plot was easy to work out and the film would not get the exposure it did without the participation of these legends I will be happy to be as fit and active as these guys when I am their age but unfortunately they just looked so much older than everyone round about them.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 14 2008critiqueFeaturedVery average police thriller enlivened by the two screen legends clearly not in Heat`s class but nowhere near as bad as some reviewers have enjoyed painting it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 10 2008SHEFeaturedI am surprised by the really negative comments. Admittedly I did see the twist and the ending was not about big fireworks however I love Pacino and De Niro and I was gripped by the film despite knowing the twist.

Ok the finale was a touch weak and the two leads have wrinkles aplenty but their performances were very sparky the mood of the film well delivered and the premise pretty good.

De Niro and Pacino still have big screen presence and worked intuitively well together. The film had a genuine tension throughout good atmosphere and some great satire.

By David Denby Viggo Mortensen in a Western directed by Ed Harris.   Credit MARY ELLEN MARK/COURTESY WARNER BROS. Viggo Mortensen square-jawed dimpled and fit is a reserved man but hes very present in the here and now (women tend to find him irresistible). Ed Harris can be spiritually intense and as remote as an Antarctic explorer. As actors they have different kinds of appeal but theyre touching and funny together in ""Appaloosa"" as two men who share a gift for silence. Virgil Cole (Harris) and his ""deputy"" Everett Hitch (Mortensen) are guns for hire in the Old West--longtime partners who communicate mainly by glances nods a few gnomic words and a deepening stillness that can suddenly explode into violence. In 1882 they ride into Appaloosa a New Mexico frontier town and offer their services to the inhabitants who are terrorized by a rapacious landowner and gang leader (Jeremy Irons). They may be for hire but they fight on the weaker side because it pleases them to do so. Noblesse oblige. Harris who directed wrote the screenplay with Robert Knott from Robert B. Parkers 2005 novel and they have structured the picture as a traditional Western. (There are echoes of John Ford Howard Hawks Fred Zinnemann and many others.) The men are divided into protectors and predators and the movie features a series of confrontations in which the moral issues are clearly settled. ""Appaloosa"" is not as ambitious as last years ""310 to Yuma"" which provided an expansive social portrait of the Arizona territory after the Civil War but it has a distinctive humor and a fresh character in Allie French (Renee Zellweger). At first Allie seems to be the usual refined lady from the East she wears silk dresses pours coffee smiles and plays the piano (a little). But she shifts her loyalties among a group of men some of them unsavory. A ""bad"" woman in town the prostitute Katie (Ariadna Gil) understands her well enough. ""Mostly the men worry about love"" Katie says meaning that women in the West have to worry about staying alive. Allie looking for a protector claims Virgil breaking up the mens chaste straightback-mountain love story. But the relation between man and woman the movie suggests will never be as pure as the male bond. The Western has been stirring to life in recent years not only because it offers an escape from the modern world but also because it offers an escape from modern movie technology. From the opening scenes we know that ""Appaloosa"" wont be a fantasia in which the performers get tossed around by digital salad forks. Harris and his cinematographer Dean Semler shot the film near Santa Fe and they calmly lay out a vast terrain of gray-brown buttes and valleys with endless blue sky above. Harris respects the genres pictorial grandeur its regard for honor its solemn conventions; this movie is grounded. Fear has sucked the life out of the sun-bleached town with its adobe and wood buildings its drab bar its underemployed prostitute. (Hitch changes that last situation.) Theres no law no newspaper and when a trial has to be mounted a judge brought in from out of town turns the affair into farce. The Old West melancholy and lonely comes off as a bleak and scary place. There may be no law but Virgil Cole certainly embodies authority. ""Appaloosa"" is in part a story about hero worship. Hitch who narrates tells us that hes been to West Point and fought in the Civil War and against the Indians but he got out of soldiering because it didnt allow for much ""expansion of the soul."" Its not clear how working for a gunslinger expands the soul but Hitch is convincingly obsessed with his boss. Mortensen his eyes partly hidden under a round-brimmed hat has a dandys wide mustache and spadelike beard and he cocks his head at odd angles and stares at Ed Harriss character as if he were a god in boots. Virgil is fearless violent indomitable; hes also a bit crazy and Hitch takes care of him reining him in now and then. Harris has an unreachable-American-hero quality; hes still the blue-eyed icon of resolve that he first revealed in his performance as John Glenn in ""The Right Stuff"" (1983). The planes of his face seem lengthened under his black hat. Hes clean-shaven a sign of fanaticism in a country of scraggly beards. Of all the cinematic genres the Western has stayed closest to its silent-movie roots. Gary Cooper never said much in his cowboy roles though as he got older his aura of tragic stoicism became better than speech. Clint Eastwood in his spaghetti-Western days spoke so slowly that he could just as easily have etched his sentiments in stone. ""Appaloosa"" turns the inarticulateness of the Western hero into an elaborate joke. Virgil a self-made man carries a small volume of Emerson around with him and puzzles out ""Self-Reliance"" but at work in the middle of some tense moment he depends on Hitch to help out when the words dont come to him. ""Commiserate"" Hitch says filling in the blank when Virgil offers mock sympathy to a mean cowboy. Even Jeremy Ironss gangster pitches in. ""Sequestered?"" he asks with annoyance naming his own situation when Virgil holds him in jail for trial. Harriss view is that the small-town Old West is struggling to realize itself its a civilization that hasnt been articulated yet; it has values but no words no goods. In a strange and wonderful scene local Indians after a raiding party on Allie and some friends exchange her captured corset for a horse on the assumption that such an oddity must be a thing of great value. Virgil is pleased by Allies refinement though Hitch of course is discomforted by the way she pulls Virgil away from him. When it turns out that she takes her corset off more than she should the two men are baffled; to them women are either wives or whores and Allie is a little of both. Harris conveys the confusion of the two with considerable delicacy. As a woman of mixed morals Zellweger has a touchingly desperate quality as if a smile would make all her betrayals go away but her part is thinly written--there isnt enough script for her to create a full character. In all ""Appaloosa"" is good as far as it goes--everything in it feels true--but I wish that Harris had pushed his ideas further. At the end the movie reverts to traditional Western themes loyalty obligation the defining duel. During that last gunfight you can feel the air going out of your response though the formal closure of the movie--the ritual push on to a new frontier new challenges--offers its own kind of happiness. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro acting together as aging N.Y.P.D. detectives in ""Righteous Kill"" are anything but quiet. Indeed they send up a howling wind of boasts profane stories lewd jokes denunciations of criminals mutual expressions of admiration and reassurances of their own virtue as cops. Ive heard more enlightening dialogue in an Upper Broadway bar at closing time but the two go at it furiously as if raw humor and mawkishness were somehow the soul of humanity. The movie written by Russell Gewirtz and directed by Jon Avnet sends the men racing around town (though parts were shot in New York theres not much feel for the place) in one of those plots about a serial killer who leaves clues behind. This killer eliminates bad guys--pimps child murderers--and deposits poems at the scene of his crime. Suspicion is thrown on one character but it turns out that an elaborate trick has been played on us. This ruse however brings us not the elation of seeing a mystery solved but the chagrin of having been cheaply taken in. Trying to cover the holes in the story Avnet who also made the execrable ""88 Minutes"" also starring Pacino (how could he have worked with this director twice?) chops the episodes up into fragments runs dialogue over unconnected visual material and ends sequences before their meaning is made clear and through it all the stars keep banging away at their lines like two subway cars that dont quite fit on the tracks. The movie is hectic exhausting and baffling. Its an embarrassment and not just because Pacino with his pouchy eyes looks much too worn to be chasing killers and De Niro is patently too heavy-spirited for the lovely teasing Carla Gugino with whom his character is having some sort of ""hot"" sadomasochistic affair. (They stage mock rapes in her apartment.) Its an embarrassment because the two greats carry enormous amounts of movie lore around with them and we keep waiting for the moods to settle down enough for some of the old associations to resonate and it never happens. Pacino the cutup lets his voice go high and throws his arms up while De Niro scowling and pulling down the corners of his mouth seems permanently disgusted. It should be a sign of life that they havent turned into softies but if theyre going to keep playing tough guys they have to work with better material than this.

During the opening minutes of the film -- an occasionally effective mash-up of Ghost The Sixth Sense and The Frighteners -- Gervais as Bertram Pincus DDS is nearly mute as a dentist who enjoys his work because it allows him the peace and quiet that comes with sticking cotton balls into his patients mouths. Hes but a ""sad little man"" says one observer; ""a fucking prick"" says another. But after briefly dying on an operating table he sees dead people. And the dead of course bring Bertram to life especially Greg Kinnears tuxedoed Frank offed while shouting down the Realtor who revealed his affair. Frank latches onto Bertram in the desperate hope that the dentist can bust up his widows (Tea Leoni) remarriage. If it sounds all so pale and predictable it is. Director and co-writer David Koepp more or less remaking his 1999 film Stir of Echoes with a romantic-comedys dopey grin this time does little to break with the genres conventions. But Ghost Town dead on arrival throughout much of its first half picks up as it slows down -- when it ditches the decidedly dreary romantic slap-shtick of the living and focuses however briefly on the needy aching dead. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky) HOUNDDOG Having lurched through a gauntlet of Sundance jeers recuts and release delays writer-director Deborah Kampmeiers Hounddog -- at least as far as the press notes indicate (urgently) -- now exists as a version different from the one that met such derision. One imagines however that the song -- both the hip-swiveler of the title and the Southern Gothic story of FUBAR families innocence and yes child rape that it brackets -- remains more or less the same. Dakota Fanning plays 12-year-old Lewellen and while the role will test the patience of even the staunchest survival-parable lovers Fannings extraordinary poise finally trumps precocity. ""Im gonna kill my daddy one day"" she declares in the first scene and why not? Played by David Morse hes an inconstant brute with a wardrobe full of wife beaters in case there was any doubt. The symbolism is as clobbering as the blows that send Lewellens maybe-mommy (Robin Wright Penn) reeling Snakes abound notably in a grotesque crotch-slithering dream sequence. Shot in mellow green and gold Hounddog manages an engaging summer sweetness in its early scenes as Lewellen plots to obtain a ticket to a local Elvis concert but in the wake of the inadvertent betrayal that leads to her now-notorious rape (a sequence that ironically seems to have lost the horrific impact it needs) the film turns listless. By the time Lewellen gets tutored in the white girl blues by a band of magical Negroes it has fulfilled its risible potential. (Culver Plaza; Sunset 5; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Michelle Orange) IGOR A cartoon to which my 5-year-old responded with an ""I dont want to talk about it"" when I asked how he liked this atrocious-looking alleged comedy about an evil scientists assistants attempt to out-evil the boss and the competition to become beloved throughout the dreary land of Malaria. And this from a kid who was as excited about Igor as he was Star Wars Clone Wars the latter an unhealthy obsession since diapers. (His mother offered only an irritated scowl followed by a brief how-could-they rant about the movies heretical use of Annie iconography.) Alas what a dispiriting wreck from the director of direct-to-video animated Disney sequels (Anthony Leondis) and the writer of a handful of American Dad episodes (Chris McKenna) -- which right there should have been warning enough. Not sure who Igors intended audience is With its copious references to murder and mayhem its a touch too scary and far too boring for the wee ones and decidedly too messy and far too boring for their parents. Steve Buscemi as a cranky immortal cat and Sean Hayes as a jarred (bird) brain on wheels are the sidekicks who should have starred; instead its John Cusack as the tiny Igor with big dreams and Molly Shannon as the big monster with enormous aspirations -- to become a spoiled actress. So bad its scary. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky) MY BEST FRIENDS GIRL was not screened in advance of our publication deadline but a review will appear here next week.

Sep. 13 600pm THE PINK CONSPIRACY Sputtering along on fumes that would barely have sustained an 11-minute Love American Style vignette The Pink Conspiracys solitary gag posits female bonding as a process so deeply malevolent it might give the most embittered misogynist pause. Sadly the filmmakers dont know what to do with their ridiculous conceit except to run it into the ground. Theres neither much venom nor irony in lovable nebbish Dave (Bradley Snedeker) discovering that every women hes ever known belongs to a sinister coven dedicated to making his life unbearable. Snedeker is a blandly endearing presence but he has little to do beyond looking befuddled or pissed off while stumbling through scene after ineptly executed scene in which various ex-girlfriends stand around delivering stiff line readings about their dislike of the male gender and Dave in particular. None of it makes a great deal of sense but thats the least of the movies problems. The Pink Conspiracys sexual battle royale is as innocuous as it is pointless no one seems to believe a word theyre saying and the jokes frequently hover in that dark space where testicles are kicked and boogers are lovingly smeared on faces. You can pardon co-writers/directors Marc Clebanoff and Brian Scott Miller for having nothing to say about male paranoia or female anger but its harder to forgive an anti-chick flick without even the courage of its convictions. (Grande 4-Plex) (Lance Goldenberg)  GO  THE POOL Leaving Milwaukee to tell an indigenous tale of life on Indias west coast director/DP Chris Smith (American Movie) inevitably brings an outsiders eye. Instead of a collection of souvenir-tchotchke exotic vistas The Pool is an album of observed human minutiae of kids hustling rupees by reselling plastic bags and the touching curiosity that passes between the subcontinents young men and women. The exposition occurs incidentally slipped into a bustling schedule of repetitive chores. The protagonists are two overemployed country boys teenage Venkatesh and 11-year-old Jhangir (played by local nonprofessional actors) transplanted to the provincial capital to earn a living. Bits of ""business"" anchor a succession of task-oriented scenes (beds turned down water from the well street food gobbled on the fly); this heightened consciousness of objects and obligations ballasts the drama-light class-conscious fable with tactile life. Venkatesh spends his rare off-hours shimmying up a tree to contemplate the water of a posh houses swimming pool -- and the girl beside it -- with inchoate longing; its his Gatsby green light. He gets behind the walls working for the sullen patriarch (Nana Patekar) never more expressive than when halving a green coconut or spinning the childs top that itself practically gives a supporting performance. (Nuart) (Nick Pinkerton) RIGHTEOUS KILL Where once the decline of Robert De Niros and Al Pacinos prodigious talent inspired howls of anguish and impassioned critical essays its a sad state of affairs when the best news about Righteous Kill the cop thriller that stars them both is that it isnt awful. New York City tough-guy detectives Turk (De Niro) and Rooster (Pacino) are investigating a serial killer whos bumping off heinous criminals acquitted by the judicial system but suspicion soon turns to the detectives themselves. Screenwriter Russell Gewirtzs first script was another New York crime drama Spike Lees crackerjack Inside Man which featured a slew of well-drawn characters as clever as the storys twists. But Righteous Kill (directed by journeyman Jon Avnet) jettisons most of the wit for macho bluster and a surprise you can see coming down the turnpike. While theres no point in commenting that De Niro and Pacino are playing calcified versions of their once-great selves at least Pacino is more reserved than usual -- a welcome change. But between the films police-procedural minutiae and trite thematic concerns (the weight of Catholic guilt the thin moral line between cop and crook) Righteous Kill isnt so much bad as it is played out. No wonder the films faded stars seem to fit right in. (Citywide) (Tim Grierson)  GO  SAVE ME The plot of Save Me sounds like a ripped-from-the-headlines gay play circa five years ago but the film itself subverts expectation. Mark (Chad Allen) is a young New Mexico man whos crashing from a crystal meth-fueled sex binge when his brother sends him to a remote desert ministry house run by Gayle (Judith Light) and Ted (Stephen Lang) two devout Christians whose mutual calling is to turn queer boys straight via the Word. A couple of Bible-study classes later Mark has forsaken meth (with improbable ease) found the Lord and begun a budding relationship with the star resident Scott (Robert Gant). Seeing Mark and Scott interact causes the already taut-necked Gayle to grow even more tense and when she blows its high melodrama but also a rather wrenching sight. Directed here by Robert Cary (Ira and Abby) Light best known for her TV-sitcom work turns a cliche -- the zealot with a secret pain of her own -- into an achingly sad woman; its one of the years best performances (from a script by Lights husband Robert Desiderio). Allen Gant and the ever-generous Lang match her nicely and though Save Me never quite surmounts its schematic scenario scene by scene beat by beat its pretty damn good. (Sunset 5) (Chuck Wilson)  GO  TAKE OUT Youll hopefully think twice before giving the Chinese-food deliveryman a lousy tip after experiencing a nerve-racking day in the life of Ming Ding (wonderfully understated first-timer Charles Jang) an illegal immigrant in Manhattan who struggles to send money home to his wife and child. Woken up and thwacked with a hammer by a gang of loan sharks who helped smuggle him into the U.S. Ming has until the end of the day to pay them 800 in juice -- a daunting feat for a guy whos lucky to earn a tenth of that delivering broccoli and bean curd. Starkly shot in voyeuristically detached DV verite by Greg the Bunny co-creator Sean Baker (who co-directs the film with Shih-Ching Tsou) Mings race to make up the difference in tips after borrowing from friends and family has a compellingly hypnotic effect Only the faces behind the apartment doors seem to change. But beyond the bickering yuppies condescending complainers and ""that bitch at 845 West End"" a seamless supporting cast of pros and amateurs and scenes shot in a real takeout restaurant during business hours -- plus a palpable sense of levity amid the humility -- make for some of the most authentic neorealism this side of De Sica. This is as exceptional as microbudget cinema gets. (Fallbrook 7; Playhouse 7; Sunset 5) (Aaron Hillis) TYLER PERRYS THE FAMILY THAT PREYS ""Youre a woman scorned with no prenup. Thats a recipe for good livin?"" is just one of the zingers Kathy Bates gets to deliver as Charlotte Cartwright a rich Southern matriarch whose son (Cole Hauser) is having an affair with Andrea (Sanaa Lathan) the social-climbing daughter of Charlottes Bible-waving best friend Alice (Alfre Woodard). Money long ago corrupted the Cartwrights and now its corrupting Andrea whose cheating ways eventually get her a sock in the face from her absurdly naive husband (Rockmond Dunbar) -- a moment of domestic violence that the usually high-minded Tyler Perry appears to condone. Set in an unnamed modern city this snail-paced film might as well take place in the 1950s since it seems to have been inspired by one those Hollywood melodramas in which one company employs the entire town and the only places free of corruption are the church and the local diner. Although juicy secrets spill out on cue in the third act whats memorable here is the sparkling chemistry between Bates and Woodard whose scenes together are a pleasure to watch even as one thinks that their next outing should be to co-teach a master class titled ""How To Rise Above Cliche."" (Citywide) (Chuck Wilson) GO  YELLA The gifted German filmmaker Christian Petzold (Wolfsburg The State I Am In) wrote and directed this tightly controlled metaphysical horror movie which begins with an upwardly mobile corporate accountant and her if-I-cant-have-you-nobody-can ex-husband careening off a bridge and plunging into the icy waters of the Elbe. Miraculously Yella (played by the excellent Petzold regular Nina Hoss) manages to extract herself from the wreckage and skip town just in time to start her new job in Hanover where -- in between embezzlement schemes and hostile takeovers -- she finds herself stalked by the specter of her possibly dead ex. In Hollywood these would doubtless be the makings of a cookie-cutter woman-in-distress shocker -- a supernatural Sleeping With the Enemy. But Petzold whose avowed inspiration was Herk Harveys Lawrence Kansas-lensed cult classic Carnival of Souls is less interested in ectoplasmic apparitions than in the equally disembodied eeriness of poker-faced power brokering and glass-and-steel boardrooms. (Hardly accidental is Yellas journey from the former East Germany to the new West.) Like Laurent Cantets Time Out and Nicolas Klotzs recent Heartbeat Detector its a corporate ghost story in which the undead are scarcely -- and scarily -- indistinguishable from the living.

In Righteous Kill which pairs the two for the first time since Heat (1995) theyre New York cops on the trail of a serial killer. And De Niro who may or may not be that killer (Im giving nothing away Its the films central mystery) doesnt do anything he hasnt done 100 times before. The corners of his mouth turn down in disgust he spits out profanities like half-chewed peppercorns and his eyes turn cold and dead. Is he working to stay in character as a Dirty Harry cop who despises criminal scum or is he just acting out his resentment at being stuck in such a gruesomely obvious and inept piece of trash? If De Niro with his frozen frown is Mr. Dyspepsia then Pacino is Mr. Peppy grinning like a madman as he drops his dated hipsterisms (""Get it oan""). Its not much fun to see these two reduced to Mad TV parodies of themselves. In the right movie theyd stop coasting on their legends long enough to remind us how they became them.

(AP Photo/Overture Films Ken Regan)  NO SALES  Photo Ken Regan AP Movie review Righteous Kill a disappointment 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Righteous Kill Drama. Starring Robert De Niro Al Pacino Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson and Carla Gugino. Directed by Jon Avnet. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are together again. The previous two movies that they co-starred in ""The Godfather Part II"" and ""Heat"" are legitimate classics. What could possibly go wrong? ""Righteous Kill"" is difficult to watch and not just because of the occasional gory murder or De Niro sex romp. This police procedural has all the originality and style of an episode of ""Walker Texas Ranger"" - without the benefit of a fun kickboxing sequence. In the end neither actor can muster the energy to rise above the subpar material. Even Pacino who has spent the past decade and a half acting at 130 decibels barely bothers to raise his voice. Its a shame in part because the expectations are so high. With no scenes together in the first ""Godfather"" sequel De Niro and Pacinos only shared screen time was their coffee shop meeting in ""Heat"" which was six electrifying minutes of nuance and quiet tension that helped cement both actors as legends. It was the cinematic equivalent of Hearns versus Hagler. ""Righteous Kill"" is a relatively harmless movie that becomes killing-a-mockingbird sinful for what it does to its leads. Its one thing when De Niro collects a paycheck for ""The Adventures of Rocky amp; Bullwinkle"" or Pacino screams his way through ""Two for the Money."" But by appearing onscreen together with their history the actors are making an implied promise to the moviegoer that they wont phone it in. And yet theres nothing in this 100-minute film that approaches either actors best work. The movie begins with a montage featuring De Niros Turk and Pacinos Rooster shooting at targets lifting weights arguing with an umpire and even playing chess Bobby Fischer-style against multiple opponents. Theyre hard-nosed New York cops stereotypes of the characters that they helped make famous. De Niros detective in particular is an homage to himself calling three people a ""mutt"" in the first hour. A serial killer who targets acquitted criminals is loose and an early video of Turk confessing to the murders makes him the prime suspect from the standpoint of the audience. Why is he confessing? How did he become so corrupt? Or is there another explanation? Filmmaker Jon Avnet handles these questions as if hes directing Shaggy and Thelma in an episode of ""Scooby-Doo"" not two of the most revered actors of our generation. ""Inside Man"" screenwriter Russell Gewirtz gives De Niro and Pacino a few good lines including a pop-culture discussion about ""The Brady Bunch"" that would seem at home in a Quentin Tarantino movie. But Gewirtz also writes a predictable and cliched story with a killer who leaves really bad poems on the body of his victims (""The old man who the children trust. Unable to control his lust. Ashes to ashes dust to dust."") and bad guys who are so one-dimensionally evil that you wonder why the makeup people didnt give each one a fake mustache to twirl. The pacing is all wrong from the beginning and the actors do little to escape the caricatures laid out for them in the script. Pacino seems to be trying slightly harder in the sidekick role but his understated demeanor starts to feel forced. Somewhere deep inside his nicotine-stained lungs theres a ""hoo-wah"" thats dying to escape. (It doesnt help that De Niro and Pacino at 65 and 68 seem to have lost much of their physical presence. Its almost ridiculous when one of them tries to rough up Curtis Jackson a.k.a. 50 Cent who plays a drug dealer. Imagine if it was Wilford Brimley and Hume Cronyn beating up South African drug smugglers in ""Lethal Weapon II."") The supporting actors dont fare much better with a couple of exceptions. Carla Gugino does a good Linda Fiorentino impression as Turks nymphomaniac girlfriend and Donnie Wahlberg has a few standout moments as a fellow detective.

"Righteous Kill Deniro and Pacino far from riveting | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesRighteous Kill Deniro and Pacino far from rivetingDe Niro and Pacino together at last. This should be cause for celebration.By Bruce DeMaraentertainment reporterFri. Sept. 12 2008  (out of 4)Starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Directed by Jon Avnet 101 minutes. At major theatres. 14A  Article Continued BelowDe Niro and Pacino together at last. This should be cause for celebration.Sure they were both in the cast of The Godfather II back in 1974 though never on screen at the same time.Then along came 1995s Heat with De Niro playing the crook and Pacino playing the cop. They shared but a scant few minutes in the same frame in the films finale.This time they share loads of screen time as New York police detectives Turk and Rooster (nicknames never properly explained) on the trail of a vigilante serial killer whos wasting bad guys whove escaped justice while leaving bits of Grade 5-level poetry by their bloodied corpses.Does this plotline have a familiar ring? Are we the audience going to be taxed yet again with the moral conundrum of whether its right or wrong to kill people who clearly had it coming? Apparently so.Fortunately we have two actors whose body of work suggests they could recite the proverbial telephone directory and leave us riveted to our seats right?Not really.A doughy De Niro delivers the same performance - i.e. pursed-lipped barely contained intensity - hes been mailing in over the past couple of years.(Brief flashes of his bare un-buff torso are almost harder to watch than the plentiful gore.)A jowly Pacino avoids the hammy excesses that have made many of his recent roles eye-rollers. But neither does he define his character sharply enough to make him compelling or interesting.The power couples onscreen chemistry which should be the films strongest calling card is merely adequate a major disappointment for those expecting a tug o war between screen titans.Brian Dennehy is wasted as the cranky police lieutenant whose job is to bust their chops.John Leguizamo who invariably brings an engaging frisson to everything he does is similarly underwhelming. Donnie Wahlberg as his partner has played so many cop roles since the heyday of New Kids on the Block he should be just about ready to qualify for a police pension.Carla Gugino as a crime scene investigator and De Niros seriously kinky love interest is at least watchable.""Shes got my sperm count so low I have to sit to take a pee"" De Niros character brags/bemoans as we shudder involuntarily.Russell Gewirtzs script throws up plenty of red herrings beginning with the opening confessional video of De Niros Det. Fisk seemingly taking the rap for the bloody carnage to follow. But the climax in which the real killer is exposed doesnt really work or even make a whole lot of sense.In the end were stuck with a plot about as creaky as a porch swing on a windy day.Director Jon Avnet captures some sense of the camaraderie behind the brotherhood of cops. But the films pacing which alternates between too frenetic one moment and too ponderous the next and Avnets failure to coax stronger performances from De Niro and Pacino make Righteous Kill ultimately about as exciting as traffic school.

ABOUT THE MOVIERighteous Kill 1/2 (out of four)Stars Robert De Niro Al Pacino John Leguizamo Donnie Wahlberg 50 CentDirector Jon AvnetDistributor Overture FilmsRating R for violence pervasive language some sexuality and brief drug useRunning time1 hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Righteous Kill is an overwrought police thriller that feels like a second-rate episode of Law amp; Order. Its major distinction the presence of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Sure those big-screen powerhouses are a draw but you need a gripping story too. (Because they work so closely perhaps a one-name moniker is called for a la Brangelina De Cino? Paniro?) Kill has a few decent lines of dialogue which Paniro deftly deliver but the pace lags and the story of a vigilante killer in New York City lacks the requisite suspense. Thanks to flaws in the judicial system a child murderer a pedophile priest and a drug-dealing gangster are among more than a dozen criminals freed to roam the streets. A self-styled avenging angel decides to kill the evildoers before they can inflict more harm. The killer likes to let police in on his motives so he leaves behind a hackneyed poem. Pacino and De Niro 30-year NYPD partners are on the case. And so is a younger hungrier and better-educated pair of cops (John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg). Suspicions eventually turn to the force and scenes of Paniro talking to NYPD shrinks or going before an investigative board attempt to provide atmosphere to whats really just a by-the-book psychological thriller. By the time the movie reaches its protracted conclusion it feels like a slog. Pacino has a few funny lines as does Leguizamo but not nearly enough to save the film from collapsing under the weight of its own self-righteous tedium.

The Oscar-winning actors who with each passing year are looking more and more like money-grubbing has-beens are co-starring together for the first time after appearing in separate sequences of ""The Godfather Part 2"" and jointly in two scenes of ""Heat"" 13 years ago. Seeing them work together as a pair of geriatric trash-talking NYPD detectives - partners for 30 years - is about as exciting as watching them share an early-bird special at the Tribeca Grill. In what amounts to a cruel unintended parody of both actors many earlier police roles - their characters names are actually Turk and Rooster - they plant evidence to send away a child killer for a crime he didnt commit. This act is somehow connected to a string of serial killings that include a pedophile priest whom De Niros character knew as a child. From the outset there are a series of flash-forwards leading us to believe De Niro is the serial killer. And indeed Pacino suggests to another pair of detectives (John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg) that a cop may be responsible for the killings each of which is accompanied by a note containing a terrible limerick. Although De Niro strenuously mugs to suggest otherwise any reasonably intelligent third-grader could figure out the actual culprit though showing this dud to a third-grader would constitute child abuse. The films casual regard for plausibility is illustrated by a Harlem drug lord/rap mogul (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson) who sells product directly to a lawyer whom our boys try to turn into an informant with disastrous results. No more credible is Carla Gugino as a crime scene investigator and De Niros (thankfully off-screen) lover or Brian Dennehy as their boss who is given to saying things like ""Im not going back to Far Rockaway because you two f - - - ed up."" Credited screenwriter Russell Gewirtz (""Inside Man"") challenges his esteemed stars to keep a straight face with such gems as ""We gotta find out who did this."" ""If we can nail him who knows how far up the ladder it goes."" ""Where I come from theres nothing wrong with shooting people if the right people get shot."" For Pacino who holds back the ham until the absurd climax this soul-deadening dreck actually represents a slight step up. The same incompetent director and producer Jon Avnet and Avi Lerner were responsible for the worst film of his career ""88 Minutes"" released earlier this year. ""Righteous Kill"" reportedly received a 40 percent production subsidy (including the stars salaries) from the State of Connecticut where most of it was shot. If New York City cant sue for slander perhaps Connecticut can be charged with exporting toxic waste. RIGHTEOUS KILL Overbaked hams. Running time 100 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity).

Overture Films hide caption toggle caption Overture Films Hug it out Curtis Jackson (aka 50 Cent from left) Pacino and De Niro find they need a moment to regroup. Overture Films Heres a theory Al Pacino agreed to work with director Jon Avnet again after last years frantic idiotic thriller 88 Minutes because the director promised him that in Righteous Kill he wouldnt have to do anything fast. In contrast to his blustering increasingly frenetic costar Robert De Niro (playing the other half of a homicide-detective team) Pacino gets loads of time for reaction shots. He sits quietly while rival officers Donnie Wahlberg and John Leguizamo are puffing up their chests. He offers a cool voice of reason when a drug dealer (50 Cent) lets his temper flare. In short Pacinos the relaxed half of the above-the-title team stealing focus by strolling through scenes his partner is forced to take at a gallop -- and who wouldnt sign on for that? I also have a theory as to why De Niro agreed to co-star as publicity for the coming 2009 video-game version of Heat a Pacino-De Niro crime drama that actually managed to generate a little heat. What I cant come up with though is a theory that explains the slack morally ambiguous decidedly sub-Dexter serial-killer-cop story thats been cooked up for them. The film lets you know right at the start that one of the stars -- their characters names are Turk and Rooster for what thats worth -- has anointed himself a sort of antisocial safety net for New York City killing bad guys who slip through the legal system and (for reasons known only to screenwriter Russell Gewirtz) leaving terrible poetry near their corpses. Theres a lot of fairly obvious subterfuge in the films staging of both crimes and investigations which mostly serves to alert you to the fact that somethings up -- meaning you get to the films entirely predictable (and lackadaisical) conclusion long before the filmmakers are ready to reveal it. None of which would matter much if there were better chemistry between the stars but they strike more sparks with the forensics specialist -- Carla Gugino who gets Pacino to talk kinky and expects De Niro to do a lot more than talk -- than they do with each other.

There are at least 13 ways of looking at these blackbirds. They are indelibly the young Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone the seasoned faces of American conflict and compromise and the most authoritative actors of their generation. If there were a Mount Rushmore of actors surely their profiles would be chiseled in granite next to those of Marlon Brando and Jimmy Stewart. Is it possible that Righteous Kill is only the third time De Niro and Pacino have shared a movie marquee and only the second they have shared scenes? They were both in The Godfather Part II though not at the same time and both in Heat where De Niro was the unhurried criminal and Pacino the harried cop on his tail. Unlike Heat there is no clash of the titans in Righteous Kill a twisty turny and ultimately silly thriller from Inside Mans Russell Gewirtz. The actors play veteran NYPD cops and longtime partners - who may be criminals. To the brass in the precinct Turk (De Niro) and Rooster (Pacino) are the Righteous Brothers go-to guys for uncrackable cases. Like the one of an apparent serial killer a vigilante targeting accused pedophiles who got exonerated for lack of evidence. Because the murderer leaves doggerel at the murder site he is dubbed ""the poetry killer."" But to the young turks in the department the old turks are ""like Lennon and McCartney"" a team so tight that there must be some friction. Somethings eating Turk a man of action. Somethings too easy about Rooster a man of talk. In director Jon Avnets frenetically edited closeups Turk goes about his business. He outhustles a drug kingpin named Spider (50 Cent in a small but memorable role). He enjoys a rough quickie with crime-scene investigator Karen (Carla Gugino criminally beautiful - and criminally underutilized). Essentially Roosters role is to crow and cast suspicion on his partner. For most moviegoers the films chief appeal is as a showcase for De Niros minimalist behavior and Pacinos maximalist performance. De Niro whose creased face increasingly resembles that of a spud with a very large mole recedes so deeply into Turks troubled character that he fails to engage the audience. For this broadly directed entertainment his acting is admirably subtle perhaps too much so. Pacino whose black olive eyes dance above a satanic smile is De Niros opposite his dervish energy enlivening this frequently tedious affair. While De Niro telegraphs his mood Pacino that unapologetic showman semaphores it. His performance should come with the caption Its Easter. Enjoy the ham. Righteous Kill  (out of four stars) Directed by Jon Avnet. With Robert De Niro Al Pacino Carla Gugino Brian Dennehy and John Leguizamo. Running time 1 hour 40 mins.

How not to dig into the experience of seeing two of cinemas greatest legends working side by side? Well first we could focus on the plot New York detectives Turk (De Niro) and Rooster (Pacino) are hunting a killer who targets felons and fiends whove beaten the system. From the outset a grainy videotape reveals the killer to be Turk a plaid-coat-wearing seething hothead. But in flashbacks we see him and leather-coat-clad laid-back Rooster investigating the crimes - and circling ever closer to Turks secret. A pair of younger cops (John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg) team with them and are convinced the perp is one of their own. It could even be Karen (Carla Gugino) a fellow detective with a taste for the rough stuff and messy relationships with other cops. Yet Turk keeps having ever-more-personal connections to the murders. And if these kills are righteous should he even be held accountable? The script by Russell Gewirtz (""Inside Man"") is late-night-cable bad and director Jon Avnet (""88 Minutes"") provides no sense of New York. His stars personify the city in a way few actors do so to not present them - and the ""Serpico""-meets-""Taxi Driver"" scenario - melding with the mean streets is a loss. Of the supporting performances Gugino Leguizamo and Wahlberg offer solid turns but are let down by dialogue like ""Is it killin time - or is he just killing time?"" Plus the movie thinks its twisty but no one with eyes will be surprised by the revelations. Which brings us to the Big Guns. Is it surprising that this is the project that brought Pacino and De Niro together after the separate story lines of ""The Godfather Part II"" and limited scenes in ""Heat""? Absolutely. However though each have done similar thrillers from the first moment of ""Righteous Kill"" - the icons side by side at a shooting range - this matchup is undeniably cool even if their characters have silly nicknames and the closest they get to depth is Pacino making spaghetti while listening to opera. The Oscar winners bring back the qualities that made them great before they (accidentally or not) began parodying themselves and those qualities. When De Niros hair-trigger sneer slides into a disgusted frown before a psycho smile bends his eyes into half moons you can see 35 years of wild men in there. As Pacino slouches through the precinct letting a wisecrack slide out the corner of his mouth he casts out all the shouting devils from his over-the-top performances. New York will always love em. But ""Righteous Kill"" doesnt deserve em. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie Review Righteous Kill - 2 stars out of 5 - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie Review Righteous Kill - 2 stars out of 5 Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Pacino and DeNiro team up one more time for Righteous Kill a somnambulant thriller that might have been better titled No City for Old Men. Its a decaffeinated serial-killer cop-drama directed with lots of close-ups and not a lot of style by Al Pacinos 88 Minutes collaborator Jon Avnet.The two Godfather and Heat vets play aged impatient NYPD detectives long in the tooth and fed up with seeing the murderers rapists and others they put so much effort and hate into getting off the streets released by stickler judges and soft-headed juries. Turk ( Robert DeNiro) has the volcanic manner of a guy half his age -- ""a pit bull on crack"" exploding in rage at youth softball games at suspects at lawyers. Hes into the rough stuff with his sometime girlfriend a crime-scene investigator (Carla Gugino) whose taste for violent sex delivers a few unintentional laughs. And Turks the one whose videotaped ""confession"" frames the picture serves as its narration. ""Ive killed 14 people"" he growls at the camera and we can believe it. ""Think of me as a street sweeper.""Rooster (Pacino) is his fast-talking partner of 30 years. Theyre like an old married couple. Instead of sex they connect at the firing range. And unlike old marrieds they still talk -- incessantly. They banter about Underdogs role in creating a generation of drug addicts their work and the case that theyre assigned to. Somebody is killing guys they arrested and leaving little poems behind. ""He took what women had to give. He had no right to live.""A younger pair of detectives ( John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg) start to smell a rat -- ""Its a cop Its a cop Its a cop"" Avnet as he proved with 88 Minutes is lousy at creating and building suspense at giving us a thriller that promises thrills. How he landed in this corner of film after starting out with Fried Green Tomatoes is this movies only mystery.But theres pleasure in watching two faces weve seen for 40 years take on roles theyve aged past and do it with verve even if the dialogue is so trite that were treated to variations of ""You gonna do this thing?"" Rapper 50 Cent plays a drug dealer badly. But Brian Dennehy also entirely too old to be playing their lieutenant (they all would have been promoted beyond these ranks years ago) more than holds his own with The O-Boys.Its too bad Righteous Kill doesnt make use of all this experience in the characters and the actors playing them. Everybody involved has earned a more righteous movie and righteous director than this.rmooreorlandosentinel.com Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel Juvenile Delinquency Crime Crime Law and Justice Death Homicide Righteous Kill (movie) Health Pulse ShootingAll SectionsNewsSportsBusinessClassifiedEntertainmentTravel86deg","http://www.orlandosentinel.com/entertainment/orl-movie-review-righteous-kill,0,2440339.story",200,righteouskill23,righteouskill,orlandosentinel

After occupying separate timeframes in ""The Godfather Part II"" and sharing just a few minutes of ""Heat"" two iconic actors finally get a significant chunk of screen time together -- if not the material they deserve -- in ""Righteous Kill"" the third and by no small margin the weakest crime picture to topline Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. At once groaningly predictable and needlessly convoluted this gimmicky yarn about New York cops trailing a vigilante in their midst could nonetheless make a sufficient B.O. killing assuming Overture Films can tempt auds with a dream pairing that promises more than it delivers. ""Righteous Kill"" primes the viewer to suspect a red herring from its miscalculated opening scene a scratchy black-and-white videotape of an aging homicide detective (De Niro) known to his fellow officers as Turk openly confessing that hes committed 14 murders during his 30-plus years with the NYPD. As Turk says in his defense these 14 victims -- a pimp a drug dealer a rapist a pedophile priest and various other scourges on society who had successfully eluded prosecution -- all had it coming. (The killers highly literate m.o. is to leave a sinister poem at every crime scene; talk about poetic justice.) The screenplay by Russell Gewirtz (""Inside Man"") lurches back and forth in time as Turk in a voiceover that tries too hard to spin world-weary cynicism into pulp profundity details the murders and his colleagues attempts to solve them. As played by De Niro with his trademark short fuse and staccato expletives Turk is all too easily provoked to violence; hes kept in line by his longtime partner Rooster (Pacino) whose early dialogue consists almost entirely of telling his more hot-headed pal to relax. Rounding out the team are gorgeous crime-scene investigator Karen Corelli (Carla Gugino) with whom Turk has vigorous sex on the side and ambitious up-and-comers Ted Riley (Donnie Wahlberg) and Simon Perez (John Leguizamo) who quickly convince themselves that only a fellow cop -- specifically Turk -- could have executed these lowlifes. As early as the 20-minute mark its clear enough where all this is headed so its unfortunate that the film takes roughly another 75 minutes to get there. Unable or unwilling to match the visceral chops and moral provocations of superior serial-killer chillers ""Righteous Kill"" is content to be a twisty genre exercise; its like ""Seven"" as reimagined by M. Night Shyamalan. And so despite the easy instinctive rapport between De Niro and Pacino who are both very much at home playing rough-edged men of action -- and who settle almost immediately into pleasurable buddy-comedy rhythms that bespeak decades of trust earned in the line of duty -- pic provides a meager showcase for the combustible duo. If the sight of these two thesps onscreen cant help but generate a frisson of excitement ""Righteous Kill"" ultimately makes a good case for keeping them apart Theres no sense of the doomed spiritual kinship that seemed to bind the actors across time and space in their previous films and Gewirtzs tortuous scenario allows them little breathing room. Elsewhere Gugino brings an appealing toughness to the much-coveted Karen whos often on the receiving end of lewd banter from her male peers and Trilby Glover shows some sparkle as a coke-snorting lawyer who goes undercover for Turk and Rooster. The fine Melissa Leo however is wasted in a throwaway role as a grief-stricken mother. Though likely to enjoy a longer friendlier reception than ""88 Minutes"" pic reps another head-scratching collaboration between Pacino and director Jon Avnet (one of the 12 producers credited here). With d.p. Denis Lenoir and editor Paul Hirsch Avnet has assembled an erratic tech package bogged down by portentous slow-mo tinted flashbacks and other stylistic distractions. Bridgeport Conn. doubles unpersuasively as a weirdly underpopulated Manhattan despite some shooting in Brooklyn Queens and Harlem.
