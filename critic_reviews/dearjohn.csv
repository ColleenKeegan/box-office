Scott Garfield/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Scott Garfield/Sony Pictures Dear John Director Lasse HallstromGenre Drama RomanceRunning Time 105 minutes Rated PG-13 Violence sensuality With Channing Tatum Amanda Seyfreid Richard Jenkins Henry Thomas Watch Clips You Scare Me Its Almost Over Tell Me Everything To say that someone dies in a film based on a Nicholas Sparks novel hardly qualifies as a spoiler Tragic untimely deaths are the authors stock in trade particularly those that lead his characters to re-evaluate the nature of life and how to live it -- or love and how to give it. In fact for a writer known for soulful romance Sparks displays a prodigious morbid streak throughout his work. So when I confirm that someone does die in Dear John it should be no more surprising than revealing that not everyone survives a Shakespearean tragedy. Unfortunately theres a lot more flatlining in this movie than the cast. Chief among the lifeless is the performance of Channing Tatum as the titular John. While his abs perform admirably in the many surfboard-toting scenes on the beaches of Charleston S.C. his line readings are similarly stiff and flat. Its on those beaches while on leave from his tour of duty as an Army Special Forces sergeant that he meets the doe-eyed golden-hearted Savannah (Amanda Seyfried). His co-star is sincere and able enough as a young woman caught up in a whirlwind romance but no one looks good trying to play off a blank wall. This applies not only to Seyfried but to Henry Thomas otherwise moving as the father of an autistic child whom Savannah nannys and to the always reliable Richard Jenkins as Johns emotionally distant father. After two blissful weeks at the beach (and the first in an endless series of wispy montages) Savannah heads back to school while John is deployed to undisclosed overseas locations. He promises to come back to her she promises to wait and they both promise to write. These letters are the only contact that John and Savannah have through much of the film so they become the backbone of the movie. There are only so many ways to make letter-writing cinematic and director Lasse Hallstrom explores them all pens moving purposefully across paper anxious visits to mailboxes and mailbags voiceovers reciting letters as the camera focuses on the readers face then cutting away to the actions being described. What starts as a charming anachronism -- pens paper and the postal service in an impersonal digital age -- becomes tedious as Hallstrom is reduced to interminable repetitive montages covering the many months that the pair are apart -- months that are extended by the Sept. 11 attacks which prompt John to re-enlist. When Savannah lonely and unable to take the distance anymore finally breaks down and writes a real ""Dear John"" letter it comes as a relief that the device has finally met its end. The inevitable emotionally wrenching final act is then left for Tatums John to carry. Unlike Ryan Gosling who was able in another Sparks adaptation The Notebook to lift the material above its inherent maudlin sentimentality Tatum simply seems bewildered. Worse Jamie Lindens indecisive script refuses to commit to either the novels relatively challenging ending or a more conventional Hollywood revision. Instead it attempts to avoid offense through a watered-down ambiguity that like so much of the film lacks both passion and pulse.

Theres some coy intimate relations and seriously articulate lets-make-the-world-a-better place chats. She tells him she wants to set up a summer camp for kids with autism; hes only got a year left to serve. They promise to write. Its all looking peachy. At which point you expect one of them to pipe up Gee arent we meant to be like elegantly doomed or something?Enter 9/11 rudely upsetting the course of true love. He re-enlists for another tour she waits. War death illness this film has its fair share of all three. Which never mind anything so complicated as grief or post-traumatic stress provide ample opportunity for great swells of goodness and beatific smiles; even the Dear John letter of the title is written in an act of heroic self-sacrifice.

To cut through the shameless syrup of their source material adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels require that real heat be generated between love-torn leads. Tatum and Seyfried exhibit the same chemistry Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams shared in 2004s The Notebook -- the most profitable page-to-screen transition in the Sparks oeuvre -- and Dear Johnclosely follows that films template the South Carolina setting the romance between a prole guy and rich gal separation by war putting pen to paper mental impairments (autism in Dear John Alzheimers inThe Notebook) casting one of the stars of Mean Girlsas the female lead. Director Lasse Hallstrom who cut his teeth crafting mini-melodramas in Abba videos deals with the inevitable emotional contrivances (mild 9/11-sploitation diseases ex machina) matter of factly. The biggest surprise here is Tatum whose butch reticence has never been put to better use His saddest farewell isnt to his lady but to a man even more uncommunicative than he is. (Melissa Anderson) (Citywide) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - GO  AJAMI A contemporary crime drama edged with Greek tragedy Ajami is an untidy despairing oddly exhilarating joint venture by writer-directors Scandar Copti an Israeli Arab and Yaron Shani an Israeli Jew. Set on the tinderbox margins of a rundown quarter of the Tel Aviv-adjacent city of Jaffa the movies multiple plots and unwieldy mostly nonpro ensemble of Arabs and Jews might better lend themselves to a television series. Yet it teems with life energized by fierce formal ambitions. Barely held together by chapter headings the action -- which opens in the middle of its converging storylines with a mistaken drive-by shooting -- switches dizzyingly between time place and point of view and the fact that you cant tell one kind of Semite from another works its own sadly ironic magic. The bleak future Ajami projects for peace within and across Israels borders can be hard to bear but this sympathetically humanist movie takes its place among a new generation of Middle Eastern films which measures the terrible toll of war not only in dead bodies but also in the very fabric of everyday life for Arabs as well as Jews. (Ella Taylor) (Monica 4-Plex Music Hall Town Center)GO  THE MOST DANGEROUS MAN IN AMERICA DANIEL ELLSBERG AND THE PENTAGON PAPERS Daniel Ellsberg was an ex-Marine trusted analyst and Cold Warrior under Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara who ""from the entrails of a bureaucratic war machine"" -- per a latter-day peacenik cohort -- converted to antiwar dove. Leaking 7000 Xeroxed pages of the Pentagon Papers study to newspapers Ellsberg gave the world an alternate history of five administrations policies in Southeast Asia and spurred a breached White House into paranoiac espionage ending in presidential resignation. Ellsberg has been resurrected as an ""eternal left"" hero in recent times publishing a memoir in 2002 and being played by James Spader in a 2003 TV movie. Filmmakers Judith Ehrlich and Rick Goldsmith approach their subject as though burnishing an icon -- he withstands the homage well. In old age Ellsberg is still an articulate interviewee; seen in his years of infamy he resembles a wiry amalgam of the Cassavetes regulars. The impressive roll call of assembled talking heads includes ""Plumber"" Egil ""Bud"" Krogh who authorized the burgling of Ellsbergs psychiatrists office; and Anthony Russo Ellsbergs recently deceased accomplice and RAND Co. co-worker. Most Dangerous Man makes a few distracting embellishments -- reenactments (some shabbily animated) melodramatic cloak-and-dagger scoring -- but in the main its a professional job standing above the crowd of politico documentaries that proliferate like kudzu over art-house screens.

The fearsome north face of the Eiger mountain became the object of national socialist obsession during the 30s. An Olympic gold medal was promised to its first summit party -- preferably to be of good blond Aryan stock and the Nazi press glorified those alpinists who tried. Though as a newspaper editor says in this dramatization of an epic real-life attempt ""those two dont care about the politics"" referring to the rustic Bavarian mountaineers who quit the Wehrmacht to make the attempt -- after bicycling 700 kilometers to Switzerland with their gear Benno Furmann and Florian Lukas play the impetuous pair. Embellishing the story is a journalist from their home village Luise (Johanna Wokalek) who provides a love interest and tears. Climbers who know the famous tale neednt be warned of spoilers Shot on location the film is slow realistic and excruciating in its latter stages. The difference between a 50- and 60-meter rope is life and death; a lost mitten means debilitating frostbite. There are no helmets GPS units or cell phones to use to call for rescue. This isnt a companion to climbing drama Vertical Limit but rather to the documentary Touching the Void. (The train-tunnel ""gallery"" windows drilled through the Nordwand are also familiar from Clint Eastwoods The Eiger Sanction.) Director Philipp Stolzl makes the movie a tad more political (i.e. anti-Nazi) than it needs to be but Furmanns stoic performance reduces the story to its harsh true fundamentals. Of the risks in climbing (as in life) he says ""You can be the best but its still a lottery.""(Brian Miller) (Citywide) ORDER OF CHAOS If you thought tax attorneys were all wonky pencil-pushers writer-director Vince Vielufs overheated psychological thriller aims to disabuse you of that notion. Mild-mannered straight-arrow John (Rhys Coiro) is towing the company line and about to land a big account when he meets his new co-worker Rick (Milo Ventimiglia) an ultraconfident bad boy who decides John needs to loosen up and stop letting people boss him around. Before you can say bad influence Rick has John partying all hours of the night fraternizing with loose women and mouthing off to his icy fiancee (Samantha Mathis). But of course Ricks motives are far from altruistic. For a little while Order of Chaos is merely dim-witted malarkey as Vieluf strains to orchestrate an edgy Bret Easton Ellis-style decadence -- editor Jennifer Mayer seems to have been paid by the flash cut -- but soon it becomes painfully clear that the filmmaker actually envisions this mano-a-mano revenge tale as some sort of tortured commentary on the corruption of the American Dream. As suave devilish Rick Ventimiglia seems to be channeling late-80s Tom Cruise while Coiro succeeds in being unconvincing as both a timid wimp and later a paranoid hedonist. All in all Order of Chaos is about as scintillating as an audit -- with slightly more nudity. (Tim Grierson) (Sunset 5)PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS THE LIGHTING THIEF was not screened in advance of our publication deadline but a review will appear here next week.RED RIDING TRILOGY Now a 305-minute triptych film Red Riding originated in the novels of David Peace who looked back without nostalgia to the Yorkshire of his youth. Peaces four Red Riding books set between 1974 and 1983 tell four compact overlapping narratives of crime and punishment -- rarely of the guilty. Adapted by screenwriter Tony Grisoni Red Riding Trilogys three episodes are each handled by a different noteworthy U.K. director. Julian Jarrolds 1974 concerns Eddie Dunford (Andrew Garfield) who has moved home from the south for Dads funeral and a job as a junior crime reporter. He starts to cover the disappearances of local girls and decries something rotten in Yorkshire as his investigations dont jive with the conviction of a local half-wit. 1980 the best freestanding film by a wide margin takes place during the last at-large days of the Yorkshire Ripper who held North England in suspense for five years and 13 murders. Peter Hunter (Paddy Considine) is a Manchester internal affairs man sent across the moors to review the failed search for The Ripper and Hunters outsider status allows director James Marsh several face-offs between conceited contained Considine and the resentful Yorkies. But any spell cast is diffused by weak cleanup man Anand Tuckers whiffed 1983 returning to 1974s crime(s) in smeary digital video. Another missing child triggers flashbacks and David Morrisseys career copper remembers his conscience while picking up Dunford and Hunters loose threads. A bathetic conclusion previews what we can anticipate from Ridley Scotts announced American remake. (Nick Pinkerton)(Nuart)TERRIBLY HAPPY After waving a gun around at home young Copenhagen cop Robert Hansen (Jakob Cedergren) is shipped to the South Jutland flatlands to cool off as marshal of a small town. Surprising no one who has watched such a migration onscreen before he finds amused villagers with a highly developed talent for collusion and a tendency to become familiar with their new impartial authority. Within minutes a married woman Ingerlise with a concussed Rita Rudner affect sidles into his office and delivers a spiel thats part blowzy flirtation and part ambiguous report of spousal abuse. The paunchy cowboy-hatted wife beater Jorgen has the run of the place dark deeds unfold on the marshy outskirts and everyones okay with it. Hansen peers out cautiously from his innocent stubble-dusted face as if afraid of being found out as director Henrik Ruben Genzs simmering stew sees a man who made one violent mistake be ruined anew by genially corrupt yokels. Cedergren is a little too bland but that works with Hansens air of haplessness and sets him apart from the colorful locals. Hansens self-inflicted reckoning is a horizon visible throughout the movie and the bog outside of town is a thudding but effective metaphor for willful repression. That quagmire where incriminating items (like cars and bodies) may be secretly dumped poses the double-edged-sword solution to Hansens despair over the past Just forget about it. (Nicolas Rapold) (Sunset 5 Playhouse 7) WAITING FOR ARMAGEDDON ""When I look at whats happening in the Middle East"" says an interviewee in Waiting for Armageddon ""I dont look at it with the hope that things will work out."" Moments later rhapsodizing about floating in post-Rapture clouds alongside Christ while earthbound sinners writhe in torment he chuckles ""Itll be a lot of fun to watch."" Co-directed by Kate Davis Franco Sacchi and David Heilbroner Armageddon is Doc Filmmaking 101 -- establishing shot talking head repeat. What makes it compelling is the juxtaposition of the filmmakers professional detachment with the chilling words and smug attitudes of their right-wing Evangelical Christian subjects who hang themselves with their own religious/ideological rope. (Christs love compassion and mercy go unmentioned here by his followers.) Armageddon efficiently glides from churches both small and mega to the homes of its subjects over to Israel with a tour group of true (and gallingly bigoted) believers as it unravels the Evangelical crowds perverse reasons for supporting Israel. It traces the political roots of the movement to a Democrat outlines said movements power bases (school boards corporations political offices) and their numbers (an estimated 50 million) and lets level-headed theologians refute bloodlust interpretations of scripture. But those refutations are little comfort against the manifest power of American entitlement and religious superiority fueling final-days fantasies against which the film winds up being a sobering warning. (Ernest Hardy) (Downtown Independent)THE WOLFMAN The Wolfman has it all -- mist drifting over moonlit moors; Geraldine Chaplin as a Gypsy fortune-teller; a dark gloomy castle full of cobwebs and family secrets; effective fake-out scares complete with crisply jarring sound; a bombastic score and a soundtrack overstuffed with creepy whispers. Benicio Del Toro stars in this lushly art-designed 19th-century period film but his beefcake-gone-bad magnetism is not enough to justify sitting through a movie thats full of sound fury and unintentional camp -- and is still bafflingly inert. After acclaimed actor Lawrence Talbot (Del Toro) receives a letter from his brothers fiancee (Emily Blunt) informing him of his siblings disappearance he hightails it from the New York stage to the sprawling home of his estranged family only to be greeted by the news that his brothers badly mutilated body has been recovered. A bonehead move that the script passes off as heroism (lots of those) soon results in Talbot being bitten by the creature who killed his brother. Blood gore and a laughably bad insane-asylum sequence ensue. Some father-son conflict (papa Talbot is played by Anthony Hopkins alternately hammy and sleepwalking through the part) juices the film a bit but not enough to save it.

By Peter Rainer Film critic February 5 2010 Save for later Saved Channing Tatum left and Amanda Seyfried are shown in a scene from Dear John. Scott Garfield / Sony Screen Gems / AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Dear John"" directed by Lasse Hallstrom is the latest movie adapted from a novel by Nicholas Sparks and remixes many of the requisite gooey ingredients - star-crossed lovers terminal illness romantic beachside gambols a crate load of hankies. ""The Notebook"" starring Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams was the template for this sort of thing and ""Dear John"" barely reworks the formula. Channing Tatum plays John Tyree a Special Forces soldier who falls in love with moony idealistic Savannah played by Amanda Seyfried while on leave visiting his autistic father (Richard Jenkins) in South Carolina. (He cooks lasagna without fail every Sunday so you know somethings odd.) Savannah is on spring break from college John is hoping to finish his tour of duty in a year so they can live happily ever after. Then 9/11 intervenes. Lots of letters are dispatched between these two lovebirds which is a testament not only to their enduring ardor but also to the postal system which unfailingly reaches John in top-secret hideaways in from the look of it Africa Iraq and Afghanistan. Halfway through the movie I decided a better title for this weepie contraption would be ""The Hurt Letter."" Tatum is stolid and semi-expressive Seyfried widens her eyes to saucer-size. Weep on.

Of course John meets a girl shes Savannah and played by the lovely Amanda Seyfried. To say John and Savannah fall in love would be a spoiler only for people for have never been to the movies. Seyfried always makes the movies shes in better including Mamma Mia. But Id prefer a second dose of Abba music attacking my eardrums to watching Dear John which indecently exploits 9/11 and throws in autism and canver for unscrupulous measure. Lasse Hallstrom directed Whats Eating Gilbert Grape My Life As a Dog The Cider House Rules The Hoax and other movies that would suggest he was hogtied and threatened to participate in Dear John.

Things were perfect between us at the start during those two gloriously romantic weeks on a South Carolina beach with Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried. There was so much potential. So much sun-dappled hand-holding. So many like totally hot kisses. How beautiful they were John the strapping Special Forces hunk and Savannah his doe-eyed coed sweetheart. Remember? I could have spent the whole movie there locked in their soft embrace reveling in the earnest endearing sappiness of it all. It felt like true love for a while so luminously shot (by Terry Stacey) and blushingly directed (by Lasse Hallstrom) almost as though the whole thing was based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. Oh wait a sec -- it was. When you introduced me to Johns dad (Richard Jenkins) he was a bit awkward socially -- you explained why later -- but so quiet and gentle and true always tending his coin collection or baking up lasagnas for Sunday dinner. Looking back on it I think I enjoyed the time spent with him more than anything else in the film. I loved that man. Loved how tenderly his scenes played out through the end. Cried like a baby. Crying again now. Yikes Im blurring the ink here -- I kind of ruined that heart dotting the ""i"" in ""crying."" Can you read it all right? The saddest part it is you had me. I was yours. I was so not going to dump you but then you went ahead and sent John back to the Army and Savannah back to college and they started doing this annoying epistolary back and forth over endless montages. And I can only handle so many montages before I shut down completely. Also sending letters is fine and all when its just Anthony Hopkins and Anne Bancroft swapping antiquarian book tips but there is not much point throwing Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried into a movie together if they cant devote every waking minute to making out. For a while I thought they were never going to get it on again That was the beginning of the end I guess -- the point where it all unraveled for me. Everything just piddled away after that the years passing without much character development and only a few little twists. The love we shared in our first half hour together just wasnt enough to carry us. Look I knew what I was getting into with you. Im a big girl. Ive been around and I know your type you and all those other smooth-talking Sparks adaptations. (Im still on the rebound from The Notebook.) I knew my heart would flutter with infatuation; I knew your script would get all fuzzy and redemptive; I knew if I let you youd drown me in saline. You promised only a slim plot tidy morals and lovers with quaking loins. It was fun while it lasted. But its time to move on my dearest Dear John. You and I are toast.

When John goes back to his army unit and Savannah goes back to her dorm they write each other letters -- hence the title of this perfunctory weepie a determinedly uninteresting sanded-down prettied-up adaptation of Nicholas Sparks already taste-tested 2006 best selling novel of the same name. But since the phrase ""Dear John"" also traditionally refers to the kind of letter a girl writes a boy when she wants to break up with him readers and non-readers alike wont be surprised when romantic heartbreak alters the course of this tremulous saga. Lasse Hallstrom (The Cider House Rules) directs with a softness that makes even combat look tranquil. The subplot about autism is its own topical distraction as it is in the book. Sos cancer. You might think thats enough of an assortment plate of issues to work with but the producers thought otherwise This may be the rare adaptation of a mass-market best-seller that adds complications in rather than cuts them out. As a result screenwriter and coproducer Jamie Linden (We Are Marshall) is kept busy writing stilted speeches for John to deliver likening himself to a coin minted in the U.S. Army. Johns dad (Richard Jenkins) you see collects coins. In such an overworked project (with a premise-busting epilogue that appears to have been added at the last minute) Tatum (G.I. Joe) and Seyfried (Mamma Mia) are all the more welcome. Fresh comely and unpretentious they bring real warmth and believability to the early scenes of young love. Ironically they make the bond between John and Savannah look so natural that the ""dear John"" turn in their relationship makes even less sense than it does in the book. But that dear reader is something to ask the author not this weightless movie.

Once was more than enough. The fault is entirely mine. A pure and uncomplicated love story glacially steadfast in your every movement youre just too good for me. Besides I need my space right now. I would normally apologize for such trite excuses but since your narrative heart clearly warms to any cliche I trust you wont be troubled by mine. Okay perhaps you deserve a fuller explanation. First I dont mean to be a snob but as movies go your heritage is suspect - born from a novel by Nicholas Sparks a scribbler who specializes in sloppy amour then brought to the screen by Lasse Hallstrom a once-respected director whos lately misplaced his better instincts. Of course thats no reason to condemn you. I was willing to show patience to play along and I did just that.Consider your opening boy-meets-girl gambit on a beach in the spring of 2001. He - that would be John - is a soldier on leave a strong/silent Green Beret sort of hero. Shes a Southern belle but really did you have to call her Savannah? Right quick you have them making goo-eyes and kissing in the rain and after the customary fun-and-frolic montage scored to the usual sappy soundtrack falling hard for each other. Now Im not thrilled by that kind of cinematic behaviour but nor am I entirely put off by it. On any movie date wait and see is my critical motto.So I waited and I saw. For example I saw your unctuous little plot details - like the happy coincidence that the guy has an autistic father and the gal has a dream of starting a summer camp for autistic kids. I saw the inevitable separation scene when you packed him back to the army and her to college whereupon the spring of 2001 turns into 9/11 when well his Green Beret doings get a lot more urgent (although no more specific).Then to my astonishment I saw how you had the kids exchanging letters actual snail mail that keep getting bundled up and delivered to the front like it was back in the days of the Battle of the Bulge. For a second I started looking for Nazis. Cmon its the millennium its the electronic age where soldiers everywhere fight with one finger on the trigger of their gun and the other on the send button of their cell phone. I mean an old-fashioned love story is one thing but dumb-ass anachronisms are quite another.And dont accuse me of any lack of fidelity. Indeed along with watching I was waiting ever so faithfully. And waiting and waiting for loves complication for you to do anything to accelerate a narrative pace that had become as lugubrious as that damn snail mail. But when the complication finally came it (you) lacked all sincerity and felt - how can I politely put this - bogus.I attach no blame to your lead performers. Like any actor the ripped Channing Tatum and the doe-eyed Amanda Seyfried are mere slaves to your script whose ending (altered from the novel) I nearly choked on. Speaking of endings let this missive be ours. Pure and simple as you are so much better than realitys messy takes on love I have no doubt you will find many willing soulmates elsewhere. But it aint me babe it aint me youre ... hey need we belabour this?

"Review Dear John a tear-jerker with some style - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Chandra Levy Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Dear John a tear-jerker with some styleBy Randy Myersrmyersbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 02/05/2010 120000 AM PSTClick photo to enlarge Channing Tatum (right) and Amanda Seyfried star in Screen Gems romantic drama DEAR JOHN. <<1>> Movie showtimes info Slide Show Best Movies of 2009 44-inch Chest Dear John District 13 Ultimatium From Paris With Love The Last Station A Prophet Interviews with the stars hot new trailers Nicholas Sparks might well be touted as a novelist but in practice hes more like a maestro of tear-jerkers. If you ever need a good torrential cry hes the guy guaranteed to whip any man woman or teen into an embarrassing emotional state.""Dear John""with the too-pretty-for-words screen pairing of Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried marks Sparks latest book-to-film romance and it exerts a power to reduce tough guys like Mike Tyson to blubbering fools.Ranked on the cinematic Sparks spectrum it falls short of ""The Notebook"" a more powerful story that featured the dreamy union of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. But its a vast improvement over his previous sentimental film odyssey the sappy and annoying ""Nights in Rodanthe"" which made us cry all right -- for squandering 97 minutes watching tripe. More movie news reviews <a href=""http//scripts.bayareanewsgroup.com/scripts/feed2js/feed2js.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Ffeeds.contracostatimes.com%2Fmngi%2Frss%2FCustomRssServlet%2F571%2F201110.xmlamp;num=10amp;del=yamp;rel=yamp;html=y"">View RSS feed</a> ""Dear John"" follows the Sparks playbook to a T dishing out a romance about two decent slightly flawed characters who fall madly in love only to find their beautifully toned bodies pushed painfully apart due to circumstances and obligations beyond their control.In this case the romance crusher is a mean old war which drives a huge wedge in the budding relationship between John (Tatum) a taciturn but vulnerable Special Forces soldier and Savannah (Seyfried) the lovely and caring rich student he meets on a South Carolina beach. With her spring-break clock ticking and his leave running on empty we know the mismatched lovebirds will need to fight to keep romance afloat. So they write love letters and through the outpouring from their pens they get to know each other better until ""... yes there is always an ""until"" in stories like these.Advertisement As expected the plot machinations in ""Dear John"" as in any other Sparks enterprise for that matter are unabashedly earnest and manipulative. And while many cynics will sneer about that a softy like me says ""Bring it on.""Look at it this way If a chef cooks up a foolproof recipe why not serve it for the willing masses to devour? ""Dear John"" succeeds where Sparks duds like ""Rodanthe"" crumbled because it harnesses fresher talents to pull off a comforting tale about the enduring power of love.It helps enormously that a bunch of A-listers including director Lasse Hallstrom (""The Cider House Rules"") hit the right tone.Tatum (""Fighting"") exhibits a range that cuts far deeper than his chiseled features. Who would have imagined that after his wooden performance in junk such as ""G.I. Joe The Rise of Cobra"" he could emote and cry yes cry so convincingly? His is a breakout performance. The same is true of Seyfried (""Mamma Mia"" and HBOs ""Big Love"") who makes Savannah such a doe-eyed and compassionate sweetheart that youll want to date her too.But the most convincing performance comes from veteran character actor Richard Jenkins (an Oscar nominee for ""The Visitor""). As Tatums mentally disabled dad Jenkins never falters -- giving a rich and tender portrayal that doesnt hit a false note. Be prepared to have those hankies ready for one particular father-son exchange certain to make you well up.Scenes like that remind us how ""Dear John"" is unafraid of wearing its heart on its sleeve. Some will hate it because of that. But if youre a sucker for romantic dramas ""Dear John"" will earn your approval along with those tears.Online ExtraTo watch the trailer online go to www.mercurynews.com/movies""Dear John""H1/2Rating PG-13 (for some sensuality and violence)Cast Channing Tatum Amanda Seyfried Richard Jenkins and Henry ThomasDirector Lasse HallstromWriter Jamie LindenRunning time 1 hour 45 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Starring Channing Tatum Amanda Seyfried Henry Thomas Richard Jenkins Scott Porter Leslea Fisher Cullen Moss Mary Rachel Dudley Michael Harding June Letourneau Director Lasse Hallstrom Running time 148 Release Opened Feb 5 2010  Editorial Review Nothing to write home aboutBy Michael OSullivanFriday Feb. 05 2010Dear Nicholas SparksTheres no easy way to say this. But with ""Dear John"" the latest of the five films made so far from your sentimental best-selling novels I think our relationship is in trouble.I could almost have forgiven you for some of your earlier indiscretions. ""A Walk to Remember"" for instance from 2002 may have been mawkish as heck but at least it had Mandy Moore. Ditto for 2004s syrup-laden ""The Notebook"" which featured strong performances by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams.Its not as if theres anything wrong with the stars of ""Dear John"" a story of young love and heartbreak centering on the long-distance romance and postal correspondence between a young soldier stationed in the Middle East and the collegiate dream girl hes known for all of two weeks. As John and Savannah Channing Tatum and Amanda Seyfried make their whirlwind courtship about as believable as any spring fling could be. The first chunk of the film takes place in a South Carolina beach town during her spring break and his military leave. Under the sensitive direction of Swedish filmmaker Lasse Halstrom (""My Life as a Dog"") the two share an effortless chemistry. Their connection like a warm sea breeze never feels forced.I wish I could say the same thing about Johns agoraphobic coin-collecting father (Richard Jenkins). Sure I loved the actor in ""The Visitor"" but his character here -- who its hinted suffers from something like Aspergers syndrome -- seems mannered and bordering on twitchy.Considering that did you really need a second disabled character?Savannahs next-door neighbor an autistic kid named Allen (played at various ages by Braeden Reed and Luke Benward) comes across here as little more than a literary device. And quite frankly more than a little manipulative. Are you deliberately playing with my already overworked heartstrings?I absolutely loved Allens long-suffering father Tim played by Henry Thomas (Elliott from ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial""). Hes turned into a strong actor.Then you went and ruined things.No Im not upset by what eventually happens. You set me up for that by calling the darn thing ""Dear John."" After all weve been through Ive come to expect melodramatic plot developments in your work (separation fatal illness a hurricane).Rather its the excuse you came up with for Savannahs actions. I dont know how else to say this but it feels like well a lie. Even Seyfried who otherwise makes a credible love interest couldnt convince me -- or by the sound of the audiences nervous laughter anyone else in the theater -- that she had to do what she did.Sorry I just dont buy it.I am going to give you one last chance though. Its just too hard to totally hate a movie that celebrates letter writing. In this age of texting tweeting and Facebooking hook-ups I cant be too hard on anything -- or anyone -- that makes such a strenuous case for the old-fashioned power of pen and paper to make or break a love connection.YoursMichaelContains some sensuality fistfighting and scenes of battlefield violence.

But the motion picture theyre in is another story.       Photo Even more than eight years later its not a great idea to use 9/11 as a device to juice up the old plot about the soldier dumped by letter as they do in ""Dear John"" the latest four-handkerchief romance inspired by the works of Nicholas Sparks. I actually liked ""The Notebook"" and didnt mind ""A Walk To Remember"" or even ""Nights in Rodanthe"" all that much. But the uneasy combination of the World Trade Center Sparks and schmaltzmeister director Lasse Hallstrom (""Chocolat"") pushed me perilously close to nausea and diabetic shock not to mention deep sleep. Fans of Channing Tatums heavily muscled shoulders Amanda Seyfrieds dazzling smile and picture-postcard views of South Carolina are welcome to add a star or two. PHOTOS AMANDA SEYFRIEDS STYLE Tatum is John a Green Beret on leave who falls in love with Seyfrieds Savannah during her spring break from college around the turn of the 21st century (though it takes a while to figure out exactly when this movie is taking place). John and Savannah exchange trite love letters (which are read aloud) as he travels the worlds hot spots via montage sequences -- waiting for his hitch to run out so he can return home to his cutie. To make a long and tedious story short Osama bin Laden throws a wrench into Johns plans and he stays in the service. Savannah sheds many tears. Our hero eventually receives a ""Dear John"" letter from Savannah informing him shes engaged to another man. No sooner has he finished burning all her love letters than John is wounded in combat and after recovering re-enlists. Five years later he meets up with Savannah again through a truly shameless series of plot twists and coincidences that involve two deaths and a coin collection. Tatum and Seyfried (""Mamma Mia"") are very likable performers who try hard but they dont get much help from Hallstroms lethargic direction especially in the desultory battle sequence. Jamie Lindens paper-thin script also does no favors to Richard Jenkins (""The Visitor"") as Tatums reclusive father. And Henry Thomas (""E.T."") is saddled with the impossible role of Seyfrieds best friend a divorce with an autistic son. ""Dear John"" is the sort of movie that gives tearjerkers a bad name. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next City of Light tale heavy on racism Read Next City of Light tale heavy on racism Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 44665 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21991 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16058 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Dear John Sappy tale turns gooey puddle on screen | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDear John Sappy tale turns gooey puddle on screenMuch has been made of Hollywoods seemingly endless capacity to make movies targeted at 17-year-old boys.Amanda Seyfried and Channing Tatum can do little to save Dear John.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Feb. 5 2010(out of 4)Starring Channing Tatum Amanda Seyfried and Richard Jenkins. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom. 105 minutes. At major theatres. PGMuch has been made of Hollywoods seemingly endless capacity to make movies targeted at 17-year-old boys. Dear John is a flick directed squarely at adolescent girls - a sappy version of the old letters-from-the-trenches weepers of the 1940s that hobbles along despite the best effort of its cast and a director who ought to know better.Lasse Hallstrom (The Shipping News; Chocolat) gives Dear John its beautiful look making the most of the gorgeous Spanish moss-strewn Charleston location. But the flaccid backbone of the piece the sappy story by Nicholas Sparks (The Notebook; Nights in Rodanthe) cant hold up the picture which melts into a gooey directionless puddle before the first reel is out.Article Continued BelowChanning Tatum plays John a brooding U.S. soldier home on leave in 2000 when he meets gorgeous Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) a sweet girl whose only flaw seems to be cursing - in her head.The two fall for each other during his two weeks home. He even takes her to meet his dad (Six Feet Unders Richard Jenkins) an obsessive child-like coin collector with a touch of Rain Man about him.Jenkins is far and away the best thing about Dear John delivering a moving performance as a man trapped inside himself and terrified to be there.John and Savannahs mostly chaste love blossoms until hes shipped out to a series of anonymous outposts. Far away from WiFi and BlackBerrys the couple gets the job of keeping in touch done the old-fashioned way - they write letters.But world events extend their separation as 9/11 means John feels an obligation to extend his tour of duty. Savannah keeps the home fires burning in a variety of ways. John gets a whole bunch of letters that begin ""Dear John."" Montages pass the time while a teen-friendly soundtrack from Snow Patrol helps nudge along a movie with no discernable plot.Seyfried who has a recurring role on HBOs Big Love and held her own with a big-name cast in Mamma Mia fares better than Tatum in this formula flick. If this moping tense dude is the best she can do better Savannah throw away her pen.

For the answer just meander--no need for running or walking--to your local multiplex. Thats where ""Dear John"" based on the Nicholas Sparks novel of the same name will be meandering on its downward path from sweetly tender to terminally turgid. ENLARGE Amanda Seyfried as Savannah in Dear John. Sony Pictures The story begins in the spring of 2001 when a hunky boy meets a golden girl on a picturesque pier sticking out from the South Carolina coast into the Atlantic Ocean. His name is--exactly right--and hes played by the model-turned-actor Channing Tatum. Her name is Savannah--though she comes from Charleston--and Amanda Seyfried plays her as a perfect empath; Savannah reacts with love and understanding to the tiniest twitch of the muscles on his handsome face. This is good because John a special-forces soldier home on leave is not what youd call voluble. In the Nicholas Sparks tradition hes an old-fashioned American archetype strong and silent and combative only in self-defense. But thats good too because the director Lasse Hallstrom working from a screenplay by Jamie Linden treats the lovers first encounters in an enjoyably old-fashioned way with palpable affection and not a trace of irony. Its as if these scenes had been lifted from a World War II love story. He must go back to his unit she must go back to school and they both must be patient until his tour of duty ends in only a year. But 9/11 intervenes John responds to the terrorist attack by re-upping and their love must now be sustained by mail. This is good and not so good. The downside is obvious. Epistolary romance in the movies means listening to letters in voice-over rather than studying live flesh in close-up. The upside is Mr. Sparkss abiding belief in the power of the written word--he wrote ""The Notebook"" which made a really fine movie as well as ""Message in a Bottle."" This film goes so far as to explain in a helpful montage set almost a decade ago exactly how snail mail works You put your envelope in a mailbox--or give it to a fellow soldier--the envelope goes to a post office a machine sorts it and then sends it on its way to the addressee. Whats not good at all is how the story loses energy and interest when Savannah is off screen and John is slogging his way through several low-rent combat sequences. They get together again of course; Mr. Sparks is a specialist in poignant reunions. But Johns prolonged absence has made the course of true love disagreeably bumpy and the perplexities of the hero and heroine are compounded by the limitations of the performances. Though Ms. Seyfried is a lovely actress her inexperience shows in her climactic scenes which arent written very well to begin with while Mr. Tatums stolid reserve decays into dull passivity. A wealth of experience allows Richard Jenkins to transcend the limitations of his role as Johns severely repressed but loving father an obsessive coin collector who manifests symptoms of Aspergers Syndrome. Hes not alone in his struggle to prevail over adversity. Other characters must deal with autism and lymphoma in a movie that suffers from Convenient Disease Syndrome. ENLARGE John Travolta is the CIA agent Charlie Wax in From Paris With Love. Lionsgate From Paris With Love Be forewarned that the title of ""From Paris With Love"" is ironic. Weapons are the only love objects in this action-comedy of chaos (long on the chaotic action short on the comedy). John Travolta is Charlie Wax a loose cannon--and later a loose bazooka--whos a special agent of the CIA. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is James Reese a low-level CIA operative who works out of the American embassy in Paris. James lives a peaceful Parisian life with a beautiful French girlfriend until Charlie bursts upon the scene and makes him a reluctant sidekick. The pretext for the mayhem that ensues is a terrorist plot but the movie is really about pressing Mr. Travolta who does show up for the damnedest paydays into yet another of those gleefully manic roles (increasingly long on the manic and short on the glee) that he did so brilliantly in ""Pulp Fiction."" The director Pierre Morel (he did the hugely popular ""Taken"") stages most of the action at a breakneck--and breakbrain--pace while poking ponderous fun at the conventions of the action-adventure genre. (The script such as it is was written by Adi Hasak.) At one point cocaine rains from the punctured ceiling of a Chinese restaurant. At another dead bodies rain from the top of a spiral staircase. One strenuously extended shootout in a mannequin factory does double duty as an homage to Stanley Kubricks ""Killers Kiss."" Still the action is ponderous too. Mr. Morel is no Kubrick or Tarantino just as Mr. Travoltas caricature of John Travolta is no Travolta. ENLARGE Emma Bell plays Parker in Frozen. Anchor Bay Films Frozen Adam Greens ""Frozen"" explores a tiny idea exhaustively and I mean exhaustively. Three young snowboarders--two guys and a girl--manage to get stranded on a chair lift overnight though it could be longer. No one knows theyre there dangling high above the snow with no way to get down and the lift will be closed until the following weekend. Will they survive the bitter cold plus other perils that the mountain has in store? More to the point will we survive the tedium of watching a trio of frightened kids who say things like ""This is so messed up"" and ""This is so retarded""? In fact Mr. Green a director of low-budget horror flicks has found more for them to talk about--memories of grammar school regrets about dating the worst ways to die. And the terrified trio played by Kevin Zegers Shawn Ashmore and Emma Bell find more to do than dangle. But theyre much less compelling than the wolves that lurk below them. Wolves may also have regrets about their dating choices but they keep them to themselves. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD Focus ENLARGE The Letter (1940) If you accept the summary verdict of Netflix which fortunately makes the film available this drama ""stars Bette Davis in one of her nastiest roles."" Its much more interesting than that though and one of Daviss best roles. She plays Leslie Crosbie the wife of a rubber-plantation owner in Singapore. Leslie shoots a man to death and claims she did it in self-defense but a letter in her own hand threatens to prove otherwise. William Wyler directed from a script that Howard Koch adapted from a Somerset Maugham play. With James Stephenson Herbert Marshall Frieda Inescort and Gale Sondergaard. ENLARGE A Letter to Three Wives (1949) Joseph L. Mankiewicz won a pair of Oscars for writing as well as directing this satirical comedy in which three married women on vacation from suburbia receive a letter from Addie Ross the town seductress who claims that shes running off with one of their husbands. Which one? To answer that question each of the wives examines or exhumes her marriage. Theyre played by Jeanne Crain Linda Darnell and Ann Sothern. The supporting cast includes Paul Douglas whos sensational; Kirk Douglas Florence Bates Connie Gilchrist and Thelma Ritter. An uncredited Celeste Holm provides Addie Rosss voice. ENLARGE Letters From Iwo Jima (2006) In one sense Clint Eastwoods film is a companion piece to his ""Flags of Our Fathers"" which dramatized Americas horrifically costly battle for the small Pacific island in World War II It chronicles the battle in Japanese with English subtitles from the Japanese point of view. In a larger sense its the second and artistically superior half of a single epic film that springs from a single act of compassionate imagination--depicting the Japanese soldiers not as anonymous Others but as men who might be but for their faces and uniforms the GIs and officers of American war movies. --Joe Morgenstern Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday February 4 2010 406 PM Title Dear John The basic necessities of a romantic tearjerker are right there in the description love and loss (and then in the best-case scenario love again). And thats what youll get -- no less but not much more -- in Lasse Hallstroms earnest adaptation of Nicholas Sparks novel ""Dear John.""First we meet our Star-Crossed Couple college student Savannah (Amanda Seyfried) and Special Forces soldier John (Channing Tatum). Then we swoon as this gorgeous pair fall in love after a chance encounter on a South Carolina beach in early 2001. They promise to write regularly until John returns in a year.But soon enough we come up against the Obstacles. The first is Johns re-enlistment after 9/11 which leaves Savannah alone and worried. The second is the inevitable Dear John letter in which she tells her soul mate that she is about to marry someone else. All thats left is the Potential Reunion but you wont find any spoilers here.This is not a movie for those who care that Savannah has no reasonable explanation for leaving John. Coincidences well-timed illnesses and inexplicable decisions are freely employed. You have to be willing to go with Sparks flow tolerating his formula as part of the package. Youll also have to accept that Johns personality is mostly confined to his pecs. That may not sound like much of a complaint but the truth is that Tatum can and should do more. Ryan Gosling proved a romantic hero can be portrayed intelligently in ""The Notebook"" which helped make it Sparks most successful big-screen adaptation by far. Still the leads do have a strong chemistry and Seyfried brings a spunky confidence to her role. The small supporting cast is equally appealing with Richard Jenkins and Henry Thomas doing fine work as Johns father and Savannahs neighbor respectively. So if youre looking for the next Oscar winner -- or even the next ""Notebook"" -- you wont find it here. But if youre just hoping for a little easy escapism bring your tissues and leave your high standards at home.

"Review Dear John - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Review Dear JohnThis adaptation of a Nicholas Sparks romance isnt always true to the letter of life.February 05 2010|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic Dear Reader Im so sorry gulp but ""Dear John"" is like a very bad relationship with a very beautiful someone You want it to work you truly do but the pain the guilt the boredom the CW soundtrack . . . . And I wish I could say its not them its me but I really think its them. The films very beautiful someones are the ab-riffic Channing Tatum as John whom director Lasse HallstrAPm wisely keeps either shirtless or in tight tees for most of the film and that golden girl Amanda Seyfried ("" Big Love"" ""Mamma Mia"") as Savannah with her Rapunzel locks dazzling smile and anime eyes. As if that werent enough sunshine cinematographer Terry Stacey has saturated every soft-focus frame with even more beauty. But if anything""Dear John"" proves beyond doubt that too often beauty really is only skin deep. Based on yet another Nicholas Sparks bestselling romance the author who gave us ""The Notebook"" and ""Message in a Bottle"" (what is it with this guy and paper?) the story begins with a chance encounter on a South Carolina beach sometime in the late 90s when a handsome stranger John jumps off a pier to save a . . . purse. ""My life is in there"" Savannah wails or at least some priceless cosmetics and hair products but thats just a guess. Hes a stoic soldier boy on leave visiting his dad a completely squandered Richard Jenkins whose work is pretty close to flawless most of the time and shes a beautiful rich girl (is that redundant?) home for spring break filling her time with beach parties and charity work I kid you not shes just that good. After two blissful weeks filled with a lot of longing looks and lingering kisses and a promise of that forever kind of love Johns off to war and Savannah is back at college. So begins the Dear John Dear Savannah letters which provide us with most of the details of their relationship and the requisite separation that any decent romantic drama needs to create that ""will they ever get together?"" tension. What we dont really have is an actual film but a very long music video with lots of montages of John and Savannah ""moments"" as they read their letters in absentia which means neither the fans nor the foes of ""The Notebook"" are likely to be satisfied. Its a disappointment coming from the Swedish filmmaker whos given us much better particularly 1999s critically praised ""The Cider House Rules"" based on the John Irving novel and starring Tobey Maguire and Michael Caine and his other Oscar-nominated film ""My Life as a Dog."" Since they dont call the film ""Dear John"" for nothing there are many bumps and breakups for the couple to suffer through what with the distance and his bad temper and her temptations. There are side stories as there always are in this case its autism -- Jenkins as Johns high-functioning coin collecting emotionally distant undiagnosed father and ""E.T.s"" Henry Thomas as the single dad in the beach house next door to Savannah whose son Alan (played by a 6-year-old autistic boy Braeden Reed) is autistic. To keep the theme going Savannah dreams of opening a camp for special needs kids after she graduates as I mentioned shes just that good. Meanwhile Johns pre- 9/11 war is set in some unidentified desert country. But just when hes about to finish his tour of duty as a special forces Green Beret and come back home to Savannah as he promised the towers come down on the TV in the background and the whole duty country dilemma surfaces but surprisingly virtually no emotion. Indeed much is made in the production notes about how HallstrAPm and screenwriter Jamie Linden (the solid ""We Are Marshall"") wanted to stay away from the overly sentimental which is Hollywood code for ""schmaltzy."" They do a good job of it so you can pretty much leave the tissues at home. Unfortunately they never fill that void so theres no real depth or texture to the characters of any sort sentimental or otherwise and I say that as someone who can be brought to tears by a Hallmark commercial. Thats yet another waste. The 24-year-old Seyfried has proven acting chops -- particularly as the oldest daughter of the suburban polygamists in HBOs excellent ""Big Love"" and opposite Meryl Streep in ""Mamma Mia"" -- and there are a few moments in ""Dear John"" that hint at something more in Tatum than his chiseled "" G.I. Joe"" good looks. The lesson in all of this? If the letter starts with ""Dear John"" dont bother reading. Just stuff it back in the envelope and return to sender. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWhos in the Drivers Seat?March 26 2000A Run for the RosesFebruary 16 2000MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewFilmEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-dear-john5-2010feb05,0,3494194.story",200,dearjohn19,dearjohn,latimes

ABOUT THE MOVIEDear John  stars out of fourStarsChanning Tatum Amanda Seyfried Richard Jenkins Henry ThomasDirector Lasse HallstromDistributor Sony PicturesRating PG-13 for some sensuality and violenceRunning time 1 hour 42 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Correspond with Dear John at your own peril. This adaptation of the Nicholas Sparks novel is more sentimental than a factory full of Valentines Day cards and more manipulative than a conniving matchmaker. VIDEO Watch the trailer Channing Tatum (G.I. Joe) and Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia) play John and Savannah a star-crossed couple who must contend with a litany of hurdles handicaps and contrived obstacles to prove their ardor. They are impeded by wars disease and family trauma -- all before they reach 30. They meet when John -- a Special Forces soldier on a two-week leave in South Carolina -- dives off a pier into the Atlantic Ocean to salvage Savannahs submerged purse. The dialogue by screenwriter Jamie Linden is markedly uninspired. Savannah mutters to friends about her handbag ""This is my life in here"" and then repeats the observation minutes later to John."" Within a few days he becomes her life. The brooding John lightens up and falls hard for Savannah a sweet girl who he accurately points out seems devoid of any faults. John however is dogged by a reputation as a hothead. His stint in the Army has set him straight but hes often annoyed by his dutiful tight-lipped father (Richard Jenkins). We later find out courtesy of the perceptive Savannah that Johns father may be autistic. Its testimony to Jenkins range and gravitas that he takes a small and undeveloped part and gives it heft. We have no sense of his character save for his idiosyncrasies. We never learn his back story have no idea where Johns mother went or if his dad even holds a job. We just know he loves collecting coins. Coins figure prominently in this tale. John gives a little speech referring to himself as a minted coin with two holes once in an early voice-over and then again in a letter. This is either very lazy writing or an effort to milk as much emotion as possible from an already strained metaphor. Besides indulging in redundancy director Lasse Hallstrom (Chocolat) skims the surface with his characters giving them each one defining characteristic. John is a brave soldier. Savannah loves horses. Its hard to get swept up in a tale so superficial. Hallstrom creates little more than a picture-postcard image of romance complete with the beach at sunset and tastefully shot embraces. The couples signature signoff ""Ill see you soon then"" is repeated half a dozen times -- in case we missed their heartfelt affection. When John returns to active duty he and Savannah pledge to communicate often. A flurry of letter-writing segues to the dreaded correspondence montage. This prolonged scene details the elaborate route a letter travels from writer to its final destination. The sight of stamped envelopes being sorted hardly makes the pulse race. Its ideal purpose would be as a sleep aid. Tatum and Seyfried are beautiful to watch and Hallstrom shoots them to best advantage. John looks at Savannah with his sexy piercing eyes while she returns the favor with her dreamy gaze. Its hard to say who has the more luscious pair of lips. But nothing that comes out of them will leave much of an impression. Youre more likely to roll your eyes than swoon over this slow-moving and far-fetched love story.

They enjoy two passionate weeks before returning for active duty.While John is billeted in top-secret military zones they exchange letters about life after his tour of duty ends. But what will happen to the lovers when a certain event in September 2001 rocks the world?Compelling premise good director (Lasse HallstrAPm) two solid performances from immensely attractive and sensitive leads. So why does Dear John which begins promisingly dwindle instead of build as if focused on the wrong end of the hourglass?My best guess is that reading the letters in a book is more emotionally powerful than hearing the actors voice-overs illustrated with images of them in dorm room and bunker. HallstrAPm fails to visually connect them when they are separated.Split-screen shots of them joined though distant or flashbacks to their time together might have been schmaltzy but they would have visually underlined the connection despite separation. When Tatum and Seyfried no longer share the screen generating heat the movie grows as cold and lumpy as yesterdays she-crab soup.The film has two curious subplots and supporting performances that feel tacked on rather than organically part of it.Autism is to Dear John what Alzheimers was to The Notebook an impediment to the lovers connection (as if distance werent enough). And also a condition to which one of the characters is dedicated to improving.Johns father played by Richard Jenkins is a socially phobic man. Savannah suggests to John that his father may be mildly autistic. She knows a little about autism as the son of her neighbor Tim (Henry Thomas) is diagnosed with it.War. Duty. Long-distance loves. Socially challenged friends and family members. You watch Dear John and you stop thinking characters and start thinking plot mechanics. Whats the next hurdle Sparks will place on the obstacle course of his true lovers?Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillnews.com.

(Scott Garfield) By Janice Page Globe Staff / February 5 2010 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message(80 character limit) Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Everything most moviegoers need to know about ""Dear John can be summed up in the seven words ""Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks.Its surprisingly beside the point that the film is directed by Lasse Hallstrom once the capable chaperone of ""My Life as a Dog ""Whats Eating Gilbert Grape ""Chocolat and ""The Cider House Rules. Hallstroms veteran creative hand barely shows up at all in ""Dear John. In fact theres good reason to suspect that the movie was actually directed by the South Carolina Tourism Board; that would explain why all the focus is on luscious sunsets shoreline frolics stately plantations and kisses in the shimmering rain. Many scenes are also enhanced by Channing Tatums copper-toned abs and pecs which practically deserve their own casting credits.Tatum a former Abercrombie amp; Fitch model who clearly hasnt let his gym membership lapse plays John Tyree a troublemaker turned soldier still prone to impulsive and explosive behavior but open to being tamed. While on leave back home in spring 2001 John meets saintly refined college cutie Savannah Curtis (Amanda Seyfried best known for roles in ""Mamma Mia and HBOs ""Big Love). Theres predictable attraction in the clash of opposites he Tarzan she Jane. If only screenwriter Jamie Linden (""We Are Marshall) could write dialogue half as good as that.Savannahs friends (including Henry Thomas as a protective neighbor) have mixed reactions to the budding romance. Eventually John brings her home to meet his reclusive father (Richard Jenkins mesmerizing as usual) who takes to her immediately despite a developmental disorder that keeps him from embracing much beyond his handily metaphorical rare coin collection. When the young lovers part as planned - she heads back to classes; he returns to his unit overseas - they agree to write each other faithfully until Johns tour of duty is up in a year.Cue the follow-that-mail montage.As anyone familiar with Sparkss best-selling novels knows this is the point at which everything must fall apart. It does in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks when John reenlists and Savannah seemingly runs out of patience before his military service is done.Her ""Dear John letter is cryptic Shes moving on and marrying someone else. His response is to burn her letters and sign on for more and more dangerous missions even after hes seriously wounded.Its not until years later when he returns home for a funeral that there is closure. Details wont be revealed here; what little surprise this calculated tear-jerker has should be preserved. But if youve seen any other big-screen adaptations of Sparkss novels - ""Message in a Bottle ""A Walk to Remember ""The Notebook ""Nights in Rodanthe - you wont be too shocked by the road ""Dear John travels or where it winds up.Unfortunately for Tatum and Seyfried Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams did a far more convincing version of this same basic dance in ""The Notebook. But that wont stop Sparks or Hollywood from remaking it several more times. Janice Page can be reached at jpageglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/ae/movies/blog.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Reduced to its basic elements the romantic fiction of Nicholas Sparks reads like a generic personal ad ""Single white character loves sunsets horses full moons and walks on the beach. Terminal illness inevitable but bittersweet."" Just a few minor tweaks away from other gauzy Sparks adaptations like A Walk To Remember and The Notebook Dear John offers the legal minimum number of changes required to let it be considered a different movie. But in a piece of reheated melodrama like this one it matters whos doing the heating. And for Dear John that task falls to Lasse Hallstrom the once-great director of My Life As A Dog and Whats Eating Gilbert Grape who later settled into a career turning out polite middlebrow prize-grubbers for the Weinstein brothers like The Cider House Rules Chocolat and Casanova. His approach to the material is tasteful and restrained to a fault. Part of the problem is Channing Tatum an actor with the strengths and faults of early Sylvester Stallone He can be a charming palooka as in Fighting and A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints or a block of wood albeit one carved by Gods hands. Tatum stars as a soft-spoken Army Special Forces soldier taking two weeks leave in Charleston South Carolina in the summer of 2001 before getting shipped out to far-flung places. He falls in love with college student Amanda Seyfried and when their whirlwind courtship ends they vow to write to each other until he leaves the service. Then 9/11 happens a relatively brief tour of duty turns into an indefinite commitment and the dreaded titular letter becomes inevitable. Two young lovers half a world away from each other separated by war their passions kept flickering in prose This is inherently potent stuff even before not one but two autistic family members get thrown into the mix. But those two weeks Tatum and Seyfried spend together really have to sell the movie and thats where Hallstrom could have used some of the florid over-the-top theatrics that Nick Cassavetes for better or worse brought to The Notebook. Hallstroms gentler touch reveals itself in a tender subplot involving Tatums coin-obsessed father (a typically excellent Richard Jenkins) but Dear John doesnt need classing up. It needs some hot-blooded emotion. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review From Paris With Love Next Movie Review Videocracy Dont miss a story--follow The A.V.

Dear John Bad Director Lasse Hallstrom. Cast Channing Tatum Amanda Seyfried Richard Jenkins. Rating PG-13 for some sensuality and violence. RELATED Seyfried From Big Love to big-screen love Movies based on bestsellers Chick flicks Movies about Iraq and the Middle East You can practically hear their cries from here as the story of John and Savannah unfolds the tears welling up as the couple decides . . . wait is that a new episode of ""iCarly""? OMG OMG OMG Youre not missing much here. ""Dear John"" is another movie based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. Others include ""The Notebook"" and ""Nights in Rodanthe"" so you know what youre getting from the start - more sap than youll find in all the trees in Vermont. What ""Dear John"" does have going for it however is Amanda Seyfried one of the children of polygamists in HBOs ""Big Love"" and Meryl Streeps daughter in ""Mamma Mia"" She deserves better than this certainly but shes a winning presence nonetheless. Seyfried plays Savannah a college student in North Carolina who is hanging out on a pier one summer and drops her purse into the ocean. As it happens John (Channing Tatum) a soldier on leave has been surfing. He dives off the pier into the water retrieves the purse and a romance is born. John goes back to Savannahs beach house where shes having a party and meets her friends including Tim (Henry Thomas) who has an autistic son. John and Savannah begin dating falling in love over the two weeks hes home hanging out at the beach and eating Sunday lasagna with Johns unusual father (Richard Jenkins always good and no exception here). When John goes back to active duty he and Savannah promise to write each other. Then 9/11 happens and John is torn Savannah has said she would wait for him while he finishes his hitch in the Army. But the rest of his unit is inspired to re-enlist. He decides to also against Savannahs wishes and after a romantic night spent together on a short leave he heads back to battle. Time passes between her letters. John grows concerned and well not to spoil things but the movie is called ""Dear John"" after all. The story takes a few turns after that as director Lasse Hallstrom follows their lives. To say more would spoil too much of the story but youre safe in assuming that the melodrama is laid on thick. John and Savanna fall for each other so quickly that we dont really know that much about them; character development is not exactly at a premium here. A troubled past is hinted at for John while Savannah seems too good to be true. But thats just the impression we get. Nothing is really spelled out to confirm it. ""Dear John"" takes emotional shortcuts at seemingly every turn. Tatum is stoic pretty much throughout. Seyfried is allowed to stretch a little more though not much. But shes engaging enough that you want to see her in a more complex role a movie in which shes allowed to challenge herself. Alas ""Dear John"" isnt it.

"Dear John | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review Dear John Brian Lowry Chief TV Critic blowryontv 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr February 2 2010 | 1200PM PT Nicholas Sparks formula of life-altering love receives the youth-edition treatment. Novelist Nicholas Sparks formula of life-altering love -- invariably faced with some grand operatic impediment -- receives the youth-edition treatment in ""Dear John"" an almost painfully earnest romance that throws the Sept. 11 terror attacks between its Romeo and Juliet. Mostly the movie provides ample opportunity to admire Channing Tatums broad shoulders and Amanda Seyfrieds incandescent smile but the narrative device that keeps them connected while geographically apart doesnt work especially well onscreen. The result amounts to a handsome Lifetime movie that could do some modest business before taking its place on the lower shelves of the Sparks bibliography. Other Sparks adaptations have offered the somewhat rare allure of seeing characters experience transformative love (""Nights in Rodanthe"" ""Message in a Bottle"") in middle age after theyve experienced pain and disappointments. Here Special Forces soldier John (Tatum) meets fresh-faced student Savannah (Seyfried) on spring break triggering a whirlwind affair (""Two weeks together. Thats all it took"" she writes him) and the inevitable ""uh-oh"" effect -- inasmuch as he talks about leaving the service in a years time to be with her but the period is the spring of 2001. As a consequence the fall of the World Trade Center towers becomes the unanticipated sticking point to John and Savannahs plans as the two remain in contact via a series of letters which are generally read to accompaniment from gauzy musical montages. While director Lasse Hallstrom and writer Jamie Linden do what they can to make these sequences pop the pic takes on a drowsy quality during its extended midsection from which it never fully recovers. Theres also too little support for the square-jawed Tatum (in a mild departure from the action roles hes played) and Seyfried the ""Big Love"" co-star who made a conspicuous splash in ""Mamma Mia"" Richard Jenkins is somewhat handcuffed in portraying Johns emotionally stunted father -- who occupies his days collecting coins -- with Henry Thomas as a friend of Savannahs family; still the truth is that theres not much to augment the central duo and even she disappears for stretches when the two are separated. Ultimately the story feels as if its killing time before throwing the next hurdle at the couple seizing on a favorite Sparks theme that in matters of love life isnt fair. Then theres the added burden that the term ""?Dear John letter"" possesses a secondary meaning albeit one that originated several wars ago. Such nuance will likely be lost on the younger audience that has exhibited a powerful appetite for star-crossed romances but even for them ""Dear John"" feels a trifle earthbound and sober. To accommodate that crowd Sparks might want to skip current events next time and begin studying up on vampires.
