Crowdpleasing and oh-so-predictable ""The Express"" is a muscular movie with social conscience that portrays Ernie Davis -- the first African-American collegian to win college footballs coveted Heisman Trophy -- as the heir to Martin Luther King and Jackie Robinson. Rob Browns performance in the title role is solid and static but Dennis Quaids portrayal of coach Ben Schwartzwalder provides a convincing metaphor for a nation going through a crisis of conscience. The sports theme may define the pics aud but emotional content could provide a crossover punch. Of course its not as if helmer Gary Fleder has a tough argument to make. That blacks were an oddity either in professional or college football as recently as the late 1950s seems as anachronistic as black-and-white TV. And anyone expecting Fleder (""Kiss the Girls"" ""Runaway Jury"") to walk the sidelines of righteous indignation in telling Davis story would probably expect an onside kick by a team up by 30. Fleders most electrifying sequences portray Schwartzwalders unbeaten 1959 Syracuse U. team playing West Virginia and Texas -- not exactly two bastions of tolerance -- with a level of racist vitriol pouring out of the stands that is a topical reminder of Americas racial heart of darkness. ""Keep your helmets on at all times"" Schwartzwalder warns his players during the West Virginia game. Whether its to conceal skin color or protect from flying bottles isnt clear. Terrific editing by William Steinkamp and Padraic McKinley intermarries the onfield action flashbacks to Davis Southern boyhood a smattering of period footage and a great deal of stylized visualization to a degree that distracts from the very basic sports-movie arc of the story Even as a shy boy who stutters (played by Justin Martin) Davis is a prodigy. Elevated to the Varsity by Schwartzwalder during his freshman year Davis thrives under the grueling regime enforced by his coach. ""I bet about now youre wondering what happened to that nice gentleman who came to your house and asked you to play for Syracuse"" says a sweaty Jack Buckley (the terrific funny Omar Benson Miller). Davis agonies will not all be on the field of course but his talent triumphs even over the most racist of his teammates -- such as the belligerent Bob Lundy (Geoff Stults). Fortunately theres also a great deal of humor in the Charles Leavitt script much of it playing off the presumptions and biases of the time. The great Jim Brown has just graduated having been Schwartzwalders greatest star and a thorn in his side. Is it a new trend Schwartzwalder asks an assistant or just his bad luck that the best prospect on his list is a black kid. ""Its a new trend"" the assistant quips signifying a changed era in sports and one Schwartzwalder had better get used to. He does. The development of the coachs character makes ""The Express"" a romance of sorts. Raised by his grandfather (the always brilliant Charles S. Dutton) Davis is vulnerable to exploitation by a father-like figure but the relationship he develops with Schwartzwalder is far more complex nurtured by a common love of the game distanced by the politics of their time. ""The Express"" may have football as its locomotive but theres a long train of national sorrow hope and promise coming up behind. Production values are major league.

"Express doesnt stray from safe playbook - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Express doesnt stray from safe playbook Rob Brown (right with Dennis Quaid) stars as Ernie Davis the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. (Chuck hodes) By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / October 10 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + If we continue to need tales of improbably successful athletics programs and life stories of professional athletes to lift us up (and surely weve had enough already) we also need the movies themselves to be distinguishable from each other. But Hollywood has a way of working its magic in reverse so that all the triumph in a story (an over-the-hill quarterback or pitcher comes back; the Podunk team wins a national championship) becomes cynically generic.""The Express"" which opens today joins the club. This movie is especially egregious since it bundles the civil rights era garden-variety bigotry and the achievements of Ernie Davis the first African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. Davis never played a game in the NFL dying of leukemia a year after signing a contract with the Cleveland Browns. His life may be sad but its inspiring. The drama depicting it is brutally dull two hours of motivational talks (""I never set out to be the best Negro running back. I set out to be the best running back"") stiff performances and game sequences.The movie kicks off like a dutiful term paper. In a voice-over Rob Brown the flat but likable actor who plays Davis tells us how many lines compose a football field and how there are ""lines that run deeper through this country and that arent part of any game."" Its 1949 Pennsylvania and young Davis (Justin Martin) is accosted on train tracks by a gang of 12 white boys. They mock his stutter and abuse him with slurs. But a flash twinkles in little Ernies eyes and he takes off running. God may have made him fast the movie basically says but racism made him faster.Daviss estranged mother (Aunjanue Ellis) moves him to Elmira N.Y. And starting in 1957 coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid pouting and peacocking) will make Davis better yet. Jim Brown (Darrin Dewitt Henson) drops by on a recruitment mission to tell him so. Brown has just signed a deal to play for the NFL in Cleveland and Schwartzwalder prevails upon his problematic superstar player to talk Davis into coming to play for Syracuse. The movie hints at the complexity of Browns natural truculence and the chip racism left on his shoulder. But ""The Express"" ultimately settles for making him a big glass of tall dark and handsome a neutered personality deployed to spout platitudes.There is so much ripe material here for a socially or historically curious movie. Davis gets to Syracuse while racial conflict roils the South but what was a northern campus like during the civil rights movement besides a living Woolworths catalog? The filmmakers are more interested in making a safely commercial football drama that doesnt deviate from the genres shorthand imagery and plot points.Its entirely possible Davis was a perfect national sensation that he played great Heisman-winning football and then he never did anything else with his days beyond play football and serve as a credit to his race. But he couldnt have been as bland as ""The Express"" makes him out to be. Aside from managing to get made at all the movie doesnt do Daviss legacy any favors by giving us the store-brand version of his life. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

But its largely been depicted as a fringe activity for peacenik hippy throwbacks not average working Joes.Pineapple Express has its fair share of burn-outs not least James Francos dealer Saul. But our hero is legal process server Dale (Seth Rogen above) whose daily grind is sweetened by judicious application of the kind leaf. This routine is cruelly shattered however when Dale witnesses a murder and is forced to go on the run with only the babbling perma-stoned Saul for company.Written by the Superbad team of Rogen Evan Goldberg and Judd Apatow Pineapple Express is a knowing throwback to 70s stoners-on-the-run comedies replete with dirty cops gangsters and manic slapstick violence. But as directed by indie guru David Gordon Green the film also displays considerable sweetness a lightness of touch and a depth of character that set it far above its forebears. At its heart the film stands as an impassioned love letter to the jazz baccy. A brief midway moment of hazy regret- Were useless when were high- is quickly brushed aside followed by an upbeat scene in which our heroes sell drugs to minors. It climaxes with a marathon shoot-out in a weed warehouse. But theres still time for a gloriously unexpected coda a moment of quiet reflection and narrative ingenuity that confirms Pineapple Express as the finest comedy of the year.

By Peter Rainer August 9 2008 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Pineapple Express Fresh off the Judd Apatow assembly line comes ""Brideshead Revisited."" Oops. Wait. Scratch that. ""Pineapple Express"" is what I meant to say. But heres one bit of incongruity you might appreciate. This goony so-so comedy about two pothead buddies was directed by David Gordon Green a filmmaker previously known for his artsy low-budget low-grossing fare about the sensitivities of young adults. Is Apatow in the business of anointing starving artists?Whatever his motives his product line is becoming predictable which may of course be the whole point. Its not just the actors who are interchangeable but the plots too. The omnipresent Seth Rogen is with us once again. Playing Dale Denton a chubster who earns his living as a process server and spends his off-hours romancing Angie (Amber Heard) whos still in high school Rogen is lucky - or maybe its unlucky - to be paired with James Franco who livens things up and steals almost every scene theyre in. Francos Saul Silver is a hippie-dippie dealer whose prize possession is a high-grade form of marijuana called Pineapple Express. When the two guys end up pursued by a drug lord and his goons they bond. In Apatow movies bonding is always a biggie. In fact there hasnt been this much male bonding since the heyday of the western.As these things go ""Pineapple Express"" is fitfully amusing but not up to the level of say Cheech and Chongs ""Up in Smoke."" But I should point out that this R-rated movie is replete with shootings stabbings and gougings - all of which are supposed to be blackly comic but struck me as just black. Gore and yucks are not an easy combination to pull off and Team Apatow simply do not have the skills. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The gross-out gore is probably in the movie to connect with the core teen male audience. But watching a guy being stabbed and sliced doesnt sit well on the stomach especially when were supposed to be laughing. If Apatow wants to indulge in this sort of thing why doesnt he just make a horror-film parody? (Rated R for pervasive language drug use sexual references and violence.)

"Pineapple Express stars James Franco Seth Rogen - Chicago Tribune Life amp; Style Life amp; Style Pineapple Express stars James Franco Seth Rogen Michael PhillipsTribune critic In its gleefully befogged first hour "" Pineapple Express"" seems to be onto something new Its a marijuana comedy that keeps shuffling genres like a stoned blackjack dealer. James Franco is blissfully funny as Saul the supplier who finds himself running for his barely cognizant life with steady customer Dale played by Seth Rogen. Dales a 25-year-old dating a high school senior. (He proudly sports a high school girls wristwatch.) Theyre running because Dale witnessed a drug-related murder and then dropped a precious joint at the scene of the crime. Unsure whether theyre in a comedy or a drama Gary Cole and Rosie Perez play the ruthless criminals who want the witness dead. The films title refers to a particularly rare and exquisite brand of weed.At its sharpest the script by Rogen and Evan Goldberg who co-wrote ""Superbad"" recalls what made ""Superbad"" worth seeing the sidewinding conversational riffs the why-am-I-laughing? wordplay. When Dale explains to his dealer that hes a process server he replies ""Youre a servant? Like a butler?"" As written that line could go either way but Franco--fully invested in this dopers doper--makes it sing. Its tempting to say Franco knocks such stupid retorts out of the park but that would imply a certain degree of focus and drive utterly lacking in Saul. Not since the cinematic cannabis heyday of Jeff Spicoli (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" 1982) and ""Withnail amp; I"" (1987) has a fully baked stoner come to such worthy comic life on-screen. Then around the midpoint ""Pineapple Express"" falls apart and keeps falling and the comedy spiced with considerable unevenly effective violence in that first hour goes out the window and in comes all the gore and the bone-crunching. The director is David Gordon Green who made one of my favorite films this year ""Snow Angels."" His work (which includes the poetic ""George Washington"") has never been easily confined to one category or mood. But theres probably not a director alive who could make sense of this scripts queasy blend of jokes and slaughter. Green shoots the fight sequences with rough edges and hand-held realism intact and the realism is ... well real. An early smackdown between Rogen and Danny McBrides belligerent idiot Red ends with the trashing of a perfectly good apartment; the scene grinds on well past its usefulness and the injuries grow more wince-inducing and before long youre thinking back on ""Freebie and the Bean"" another comedy that kept morphing into an accidental and deliberately acrid action picture.For all that Francos on-screen rapport with Rogen is a fine thing. Certain lines keep coming back to me lines that couldve come only from truly talented writers. ""Hey I can see through my leg hole"" is one; Franco says it after he kicks through his own windshield during a vehicular chase sequence. Also theres a throwaway bit with Franco attempting to buzz Rogen into his apartment that approaches perfection--the quintessence of pot humor honoring the tradition of the ""Daves not here"" routine (Cheech amp; Chong for the uninitiated). ""Pineapple Express"" could care less about perfection; its mood swings and genre change-ups are deliberately messy. Few comedies recently have started so well and ended so poorly. Whether that first half is enough is entirely up to your receptivity to another pair of jolly Judd Apatow-sanctioned boy-mentaking time to smell the roses even as people are trying to kill them. mjphillipstribune.comSMPAA rating R (for pervasive language drug use sexual references and violence).

This is an endearingly slovenly profane movie with bursts of startling violence but its all played for nyuk-nyuk laughs and it has been directed with more care than it might initially appear by David Gordon Green (Snow Angels George Washington) here making his first genuine bid for mainstream success. Working once again with his usual cinematographer Tim Orr Green brands Pineapple Express with his personal stamp via a somewhat languid pace and occasional detours into pointless but lyrical bits of business such as a sequence in which a group of schoolkids smoke some dope and dance little celebratory jigs. But Pineapple Express feels most like another raucous entry in the canon of the Superbad pack of producer Judd Apatow (Knocked Up The 40 Year-Old Virgin) and actor-screenwriter Seth Rogen. Rogen plays Dale a slacker-ish process server with an 18-year-old girlfriend (Amber Heard) and a pot habit fueled by his ingratiating dealer Saul (James Franco). The films title refers to a new kind of weed Saul has just received marijuana so rare its almost a shame to smoke it he says. Its like killing a unicorn. But they go ahead and light up anyway resulting in a chain of events that finds the shaggy pair on the run from a murderous drug lord (Gary Cole) and a trigger-happy cop (Rosie Perez) on his payroll. There are only about 30 minutes of actual plot in Pineapple Express. The bulk of the movie simply pits the actors in pot-fueled riffs (a lot of the dialogue was improvised on the set) and follows wherever they happen to take them. The appeal of funny stoners prancing around onscreen has its limits Theres a reason for example why Jeff Spicoli was not the central character in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. But Pineapple Express never outstays its welcome because Rogen and Franco the latter obviously relishing the rare opportunity to play comedy have a natural rapport that keeps you engaged even when theyre sitting around watching 227 on TV. Their relationship which is slyly structured as a subversive romance (Im totally glad I dipped in your ink Saul tells Dale about their budding friendship) follows the Apatow tradition of countering the coarseness of the material with an underlying tenderness. Dale and Saul grow on you as people not just potheads The weed just makes them funnier. As usual in an Apatow comedy too all the supporting players get their turn to shine whether its Danny McBrides meaty supporting role as a friend of Saul who is dragged into their crisis (it is McBride who gets to utter the line You just got killed by a Daewoo Lanos [expletive]) or Ed Begley Jr. as the shotgun-toting father of Dales underage girlfriend. He too gets a few memorable bits of dialogue although it cant be repeated here. Yes Pineapple Express is exceedingly crude but its never mean or lewd and for all the drugs and gore in it the movie is also strangely unrelentingly sweet even when its characters are bleeding to death after having been shot in the stomach.

"Pineapple Express reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Pineapple Express reviewed. Pineapple Express reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Aug. 6 2008 1157 AM Bud Movie Pineapple Express has its moments but its kind of harsh. By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about Pineapple Express click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Pineapple Express Pineapple Express is this summers precise equivalent to Superbad a Judd Apatow-produced buddy comedy directed by a proxy from the indie world (last time around it was The Daytrippers Greg Mottola; this time its All the Real Girls David Gordon Green). Both movies follow three marginally functional man-boys through a day and night of substance-abuse-related mayhem. The two movies were even released in the same part of the season as a dog-days follow-up to the big Apatow comedy of early summer (in 2007 Knocked Up; this year Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Laugh for laugh Pineapple Express is way funnier than Superbad. It may be the funniest mainstream comedy released so far this year (not that that means much when youve got The Love Guru pulling down your average). But my problem with the movie is the same that I had with its 2007 twin Its a moral thing. The swath of destruction these boys leave in their wake--and Pineapple Express unlike its predecessor boasts a significant body count--seems disproportionate to the prevailing mood of dopey fun. Must every boys night out culminate in exploding vehicles multiple gunshot wounds and piles of sadistically dispatched villains? Whatever happened to heading out to White Castle for sliders? Advertisement So much stoner humor rests on the simple fact that when youre high accomplishing the most mundane task feels like a cognitive milestone. Hence the slider quest of the first Harold and Kumar movie or Anna Faris bewildering trek across Los Angeles in the unaccountably ignored Smiley Face. But Seth Rogen and James Franco as the permanently zonked heroes of Pineapple Express are saddled with problems that would stress out even the unbaked among us. Rogen plays Dale Denton a process server in his mid-20s with little ambition beyond toking up and hanging with his barely legal girlfriend. On the way to deliver a subpoena to a drug boss named Ted Jones (Gary Cole) Dale witnesses a murder and flees in a panic to the house of his dimwitted dealer Saul Silver (Franco). Dale leaves his joint behind at the crime scene and Ted immediately pegs the weed as ""Pineapple Express"" a strain so rare that only he supplies it. Thus are Saul and Dale marked for destruction along with Sauls middleman Red (Danny McBride). The shaggy script (by Apatow Rogen and Evan Goldberg) careens deliriously from couchbound bull sessions to hyperviolent set pieces. The former are often hysterical especially an early scene in which the needy Saul ropes Dale into smoking a state-of-the-art ""cross-joint"" while he holds forth on the work of his ""second-favorite civil engineer"" and the glories of Pineapple Express (""It smells like Gods vagina ... smoking this is sort of like killing a unicorn""). Similar to Brad Pitt Franco may be a great character actor trapped in a leading mans body. He drooped as a listless hunk in the Spider-Man movies the historical romance Flyboys and that TV biopic of James Dean. But his Saul Silver is a wonder a pajama-clad philosopher nearly dumb enough to qualify as a holy fool. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Rogens acerbic and bumbling but ultimately warmhearted Dale isnt exactly a stretch from the character hes been playing ever since Freaks and Geeks--himself I guess--but he reliably delivers the Rogen goods. And Danny McBride as the blustering cowardly Red (imagine Falstaff in a mullet and a frayed kimono) is a genuine comic discovery. Indeed McBride ought to have been discovered earlier this summer as a lovelorn tae kwon do instructor in the barely seen indie comedy The Foot Fist Way. But between this attention-grabbing role and his appearance next week in Ben Stillers Tropic Thunder he should be commanding his own goofy franchise in a matter of months. David Gordon Green and his fine cinematographer Tim Orr whose previous films have been long on poetic voice-over and contemplative landscape-gazing have no idea how to direct an action sequence--and why should they? The nearly 20-minute shoot-em-up that concludes this film involving car crashes bombs Korean ninjas and light-saber duels with marijuana grow lights makes no visual sense. But worse it makes no sense in the movie as a whole. Why at the end of a movie thats all about the minimalist pleasures of friendship (in one lovely dialogue-free scene Dale and Saul play leapfrog in the woods and marvel at a caterpillar) do we need an extended tribute to Tarantino-style ""comic"" gore? I guess the sight of Seth Rogen holding up a square-inch segment of his own ear cartilage does provide a frisson of queasy hilarity. But the casual bloodthirstiness of the last reel--particularly the dreadful end met by one endearing thug--seems out of keeping with the movies essential sweetness a far cry from Sauls trademark sign off ""Peace out.""

"Pineapple Express One toke over the line | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesPineapple Express One toke over the lineThe problem with stoner comedies it seems to me is not so much the content as the viewing conditions.By Peter HowellMovie CriticWed. Aug. 6 2008Starring James Franco Seth Rogen Danny R. McBride Rosie Perez Gary Cole Ed Begley Jr. and Nora Dunn. Directed by David Gordon Green. At major theatres. 111 minutes. 18AThe problem with stoner comedies it seems to me is not so much the content as the viewing conditions.In a perfect world herbal humour would be enjoyed in a theatre converted into a giant bong where chronic doses could be wafted to willing nostrils via the ventilation system. Unfortunately such far-sighted cinema is limited by cost and legal concerns.Which leaves us at a disadvantage appraising movies like Pineapple Express where its clear that the tokers onscreen are having a far better time than we sober judges in the seats.Whatever is in the titular bud that Seth Rogen and James Franco are inhaling - Pineapple Express weed is described as so rare and so good smoking it is like ""killing a unicorn"" - their enjoyment of it is almost selfish since theyre getting laughs that we are denied. (This goes in spades for the nod to Reefer Madness that opens the film which looks like a bad YouTube video that escaped from cyberspace.)Article Continued BelowThis being the latest issue from the Judd Apatow giggle factory however you need not worry about being locked into one style of yuks. Apatow is big on hybrid humour and so apparently is his unlikely directorial disciple David Gordon Green who normally makes the type of grim indie dramas that win raves at Sundance and then head straight for the discount-DVD bins.Pineapple Express is both a stoner laugher and a bloody crime satire about duelling drug lords and crooked cops. The body count is large and the violence is quite nasty which means that while youre getting high on life you could also be brought low by scenes of seriously gratuitous violence. Harold and Kumar busted out of Guantanamo Bay with far less mayhem. Luckily Francos character Saul is one of those sweet summer discoveries that makes you willing to forgive the films many flaws. Hes a sleepy-eyed Socrates in striped pants the kind of guy who looks danger in the eye and offers it a beer some bud or an out-there bromide. Hes consistently hilarious and worth the price of admission.Saul dispenses drugs to Rogens Dale a process server whose brazen methods are at odds with his relatively conservative demeanour. Hes most comfortable in a tie and even when hes as glazed as a doughnut he still frets about getting into trouble.A justifiable concern because while enjoying a private pharmaceutical moment in a parked car Dale witnesses a messy mob hit by psycho drug lord Ted Jones (Gary Cole) in cahoots with bad cop Carol Brazier (Rosie Perez). Dale is so rattled by this that he beats a hasty and noisy retreat flipping his incriminating Pineapple Express roach to the ground as he squeals away. In one of the most imaginative uses yet of a movie MacGuffin the weeds uniqueness lets Jones trace it back to delightful doper Saul and the chase is on.Pity similar invention isnt exhibited in the rest of the film which gets bloodier as the chuckle count plummets. Apatow and Green introduce yet another major subplot involving Dales high school girlfriend Angie (Amber Heard) that could be a movie unto itself. Angie is more mature than Dale even though shes younger than him. Her uptight parents (a well-cast Ed Begley Jr. and Nora Dunn) dont approve of Dale especially when he gets the family caught up in his mobster hijinks.Hijinks that include the Rasputin-like behaviour of Red (Danny R. McBride) Sauls dodgy chum who is too stunned (or baked) to notice that a body full of bullets usually results in death. There hasnt been a corpse with this much personality since Shaun of the Dead.As Pineapple Express floats to its frightfully violent end it becomes all the more obvious Apatow and Green are just throwing whatever they can at the screen to see what will get either a laugh or a grimace. More likely the latter since youll likely leave the theatre wondering if you saw a comedy or a Sam Peckinpah movie.Couldnt Apatow and Green just have followed Sauls lead inhaled a little harder and kept us all smiling?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

At this time of year all films start blending into one something about a comic book superhero with arrested-development issues who saves the world while making pee-pee jokes. Produced by Judd Apatow. Our current entry Pineapple Express is more of the blow-em-up slap-happy same. Forget its similarities to earlier summer fare. This is one of two action films this month with mammoth John Woo-movie-like explosions in parody form; next weeks Tropic Thunder is the other. It is also the second movie this week in which a major plot point is an older mans promise to meet with his student girlfriends parents. (Cf. Elegy a romantic drama that has nothing else in common with Pineapple Express.) Finally its the third picture this summer and the eighth in the past 14 months that was produced written or otherwise perpetrated by Apatow. Take a deep breath Knocked Up Superbad Walk Hard Drillbit Taylor Forgetting Sarah Marshall You Dont Mess With the Zohan Step Brothers Pineapple Express. The actual inexhaustible force behind the new movie is Seth Rogen the 26-year-old comedy prodigy (in a 45-year-old accountants body) who has starred in Knocked Up Superbad and Pineapple Express; co-wrote the last two plus Drillbit Taylor with his longtime pal Evan Goldberg as well as co-producing them; and presumably on weekends provided voices for the animated films Horton Hears a Who and Kung Fu Panda and for the Hogsqueal character in The Spiderwick Chronicles. The characters he plays may be slackers but in real life this guy is organized. Working from Apatows notion to graft an action-movie plot on a dope-movie premise Rogen and Goldberg came up with a concoction that synthesizes the standard thrills of the first genre while exceeding the usual humor quotient of the second. Granted thats not the toughest job and Pineapple Express aims for nothing more than rowdy fun. Still director David Gordon Green -- who has made some terrific indie movies about isolated youths (George Washington Snow Angels) and probably took this job cause he wanted to make a movie more than a handful of people would see -- mixes all the ingredients to create a comedy that brings a nicely deflating note of realism to action-film mayhem as well as being one of the few drug movies you dont have to be high to enjoy. Rogen is Dale Denton who works as a process server and plays at being the wise older beau to high-school senior Angie (Amber Heard). But his vocation is dope-smoking which makes his dealer Saul (James Franco) if not Dales best friend then surely his most trusted business acquaintance. Its after a visit to Saul for some amazing weed known as Pineapple Express that Dale parks outside the home of his next subpoena victim Ted Jones (Gary Cole). BLAM go some guns SPLAT goes the body of an Asian man against the second-floor window and CRUNCH ZOOM goes Dales car in escape mode. (CRUNCH because hes smashed two adjacent vehicles trying to make his getaway.) In his panic he dropped the marijuana cigarette he was toking -- evidence that sends Ted and his gang tearing after Saul. The rest of the picture is a bunch of knowing giggly riffs on action cliches in the hundreds of movies spawned by Lethal Weapon. The gag here is that the two heroes engaged in the movies requisite action scenes -- the hand-to-hand combat the car chase the climactic military-style battle ending in a giant explosion -- are klutzy boobs. Dale and Saul have the need and instinct to fight drive and run but none of the skills. One sequence the movies lamest is either a demonstration of this theory or an undercutting commentary on it. As they stagger through the woods searching for a cell phone Saul has tossed away Rogen and Franco take a stab at a slapstick routine but possess neither the precision nor the physical resilience to make it funny. (Nor the luck Franco needed three stitches after he bumped into a tree.) The actors flounder like two Stooges in desperate need of a third.

Saul Silver (James Franco left) Red (Danny McBride center) and Dale Denton (Seth Rogen right) run for their lives in Columbia Pictures action-comedy Pineapple Express. Photo Dale Robinette Pineapple looks stoned behind the camera too 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Thats the problem with trying to create a good stoner comedy. To get the tone right the writers actors and probably the director need to be really baked throughout the creative process. But once they reach that point they cant focus for more than one or two scenes at a time. Pretty soon the dialogue is filled with non sequiturs the narrative starts to drag and the production suffers from fits of short-term memory loss. What was I saying? Oh yeah ""Pineapple Express"" the latest movie in producer Judd Apatows hostile takeover of Hollywood (its like ""Red Dawn"" except with chubbier Wolverines) is extremely humorous at times but also very uneven. Much as in the recent Tenacious D stoner comedy that only 12 people saw the pre-credits sequence is the best part. Probably the aspect that makes this film different is the inclusion of 1970s-style action sequences a concept that is explored only in fits and starts. Its a funny mostly harmless and entertaining film with a bad case of dry mouth. The movie begins in the 1930s with a private in the Army smoking Pineapple Express a super-stony strain of pot thats being grown in an underground lab. ""I feel like a slice of butter melting over a big ole pile of flapjacks. Yeah"" says the experiment subject played by Bill Hader in one of the movies multiple standout cameos. After a few more minutes of hilarity we move to the present day where process server Dale (Apatow regular Seth Rogen) meets with his super-friendly drug dealer Saul (James Franco). After Dale witnesses a shooting the two stoners and their cache of Pineapple Express get wrapped into a crime comedy-drama thats two parts Cheech and Chong and one part ""To Live and Die in L.A.."" Its reminiscent in tone of Doug Limans underrated druggie dramedy ""Go"" except this movie is way less tightly paced and has almost no major female characters. Rogen contributes his usual decent effort and young director David Gordon Green herds all the cats well. But the real standout here is Palo Alto native Franco who plays Saul as a really sweet guy who probably needs to cut back on his own product buy some pants that arent pajama bottoms and find a nice girl who will let him be a stay-at-home dad. He gets many of the best lines. (""Its almost a sin to smoke this"" he says the first time he lights up some Express. ""Its like killing a unicorn."") Franco is the one constant in ""Pineapple Express."" Usually with these types of films you figure that theres a producer or a key grip or at very least one of the craft service people who is remaining sober so the production maintains continuity. On ""Pineapple Express"" it must have been bong hits all around from the moment everyone walked onto the set. Normally reliable actors break character entire chunks of dialogue seem to be missing and plot threads are abandoned. Even the action parts seem to come and go on the whim of everyones mood that day. Unlike the equally funny but much more cleverly structured ""Hot Fuzz"" the ""Pineapple Express"" filmmakers seem to forget for huge stretches of time that theyre making an action picture. (Everyone was apparently so distracted by all the Fruit Roll-Ups lying around that they even forgot to call Jonah Hill for his obligatory Apatow film cameo.) But when the movie is good its memorably hilarious. A car chase that takes place with the drivers foot thrust through the front window generates several building laughs. And credit goes to screenwriters Rogen and Evan Goldberg for writing the first comedy of any kind - bombed or sober - to name-drop Golden Gate Bridge engineer M.M. OShaughnessy in a joke. Its also funny to see the normally reserved Ed Begley Jr. throw a few f-bombs and show that he can handle a shotgun. Now Hollywood will think twice about double-parking in front of his Prius. -- Advisory This film contains violence profanity drug use and some poor pot-smoking etiquette including getting the end of the joint soggy leaving roaches behind that still have a little weed in them (but are too small to light again) and much bogarting.

""Its almost a shame to smoke it. Its like killing a unicorn.""A stoner comedy with a Superbad template and a penchant for jokey graphic violence by way of Tarantino (bloody ears bleeding guts) Pineapple Express is the latest lowbrow screwball gross and goofy romp to roll off the Judd Apatow assembly line. Lets see - Step Brothers Forgetting Sarah Marshall Drillbit Taylor You Dont Mess With the Zohan . . . I think its the writer-producers 88th movie this year. The film which teams the sublimely spaced-out Franco with Apatow cohort and Knocked Up star Seth Rogen - the duo are like Abbott and Costello saturated in THC - also marks a departure for director Green. A writer and director of serious seriously accomplished indies (George Washington All the Real Girls Snow Angels) the filmmaker gets to orchestrate big Hollywood stunts (a car chase a warehouse shoot-out) and parody our cultures obsession with firearms. (At least I think all that firearm fetishism is parody.) Rogen plays Dale Denton a dedicated pothead who tools around town serving subpoenas - while toking weed and listening to talk radio. Life is good He has a beautiful girlfriend (Amber Heard) even if he has to rationalize the fact shes still in high school. And he has a great dealer Saul a guy who wears pajamas all day watches Room 227 reruns and doles out doobies for a living. The trouble starts when Dale having dropped by Sauls for a bag of Pineapple Express - and having shared a uniquely designed joint with his dealer - gets back into his car and witnesses a murder. A uniformed officer (Rosie Perez) and a guy (Gary Cole) who turns out to be a drug kingpin (and Sauls supplier) take turns firing at an Asian man. The killers see that Dale has witnessed the shooting and so the chase is on. What follows is a bunch of Looney Tune set pieces a campout/freakout in the woods a stolen police car and a furious fight scene that ends in the comic duct-taping of doofus character actor Danny McBride. And then theres Dales long-planned visit to meet his girlfriends parents (Ed Begley Jr. and Nora Dunn). Needless to say with thugs dopers and cops on his heels the woefully stoned Dales parley with the parentals does not go as planned. Like last summers Apatow entry Superbad his Pineapple Express is very much about male friendship buddies and bonding. The movies too long - and the violence and mayhem are unexpectedly harsh and heavy - but Francos inspired looped performance is right up there in the annals of reefer filmdom with Jeff Bridges the Dude in The Big Lebowski. Like Francos Saul says in an altogether different context ""The monkeys out of the bottle man.""Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Pineapple Express. (R) Columbia (112 min.) Directed by David Gordon Green. With James Franco Seth Rogen. Opens Wednesday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO STARS ""Pineapple Express"" has guys getting kicked in the crotch dope smoking car crashes other guys getting kicked in the crotch dope dealing car chases still more guys getting kicked in the crotch underage dope smoking and dealing and fatal car accidents. But where are the jokes? The characters? The story? Dude wheres my movie? Of course ""Pineapple Express"" is a stoner film and they have an illogic all their own. Two best buds party on sling copious amounts of hipster slang and stay stubbornly slow on the uptake. In pictures like this trips to White Castle -- and other most excellent adventures -- are mere sideshows. But its still not much of a film. Theres a reason why these movies generally do much better on home video than they do in theaters -- and its not just because their target audience sometimes finds it hard to leave the futon. Its that theyre funniest at 2 in the morning taken in small shared doses after a long party. Seen alone at 7 in the evening on nothing stronger than a quart of cola they dont quite connect. The story stars Seth Rogen -- whose sloppy shambling schlub act is beginning to wear thin -- as a drug-using process server with a barely legal high-school girlfriend. (Because of course what pretty 18-year-old wouldnt fall hard for Seth Rogen?) But then he accidentally witnesses a gangland hit and he and his dope dealer have to flee. Think of it as ""Some Like It Baked."" Any thought you give it though will probably be more than what the filmmakers have. The sloppy script (which Rogen co-wrote) aspires to nothing more than old Cheech and Chong routines built around frustrating circuitous conversations. The story is just as misdirected with both off-putting details (do they really have to have one hero selling pot to children or Rogen trolling high-school hallways?) and insincere sermons about drug use. The one bright spot in all of this is James Franco who gets the best part as the dope pusher. Franco has been doing surprising work for a while now and in unexpected places (he brought some true tortured anguish to Harry Osbourne in the ""Spider-Man"" films). Here he gives Saul a strangely childlike charm -- even without the herb he seems like the kind of guy whod spend an hour staring at a caterpillar. Too bad the movie eventually morphs into a relatively straight-forward action picture with ninja assassins and as they used to say on ""SCTV"" things that ""blowed up real good."" (In that way its a little like next weeks better ""Tropic Thunder"" which also slips into ""Rambo"" mode -- if every actor secretly wants to be a rock star sometimes it seems as if every comic secretly wants to be Sly Stallone.) Franco is wonderful though as is Danny McBride an actor I havent liked before (and who also shows up in ""Tropic Thunder"") but has a mad and unpredictable quality here. And although I sat through most of the screening only smiling faintly I have to say that the three young men behind me laughed often. When they werent knocking over the big tall boys of beer theyd smuggled into the preview. And while I really dont want to suggest you might enjoy this movie more if you followed their behavior ... Rating note The film contains drug use strong language and gory violence. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

The L.A. rocker sporting a red-tinged Mohawk hairdo appeared in a crowded Manhattan courtroom to face charges that could have cost him up to a year in the clink. He was caught copping 100 worth of heroin at a Lower East Side housing project in June. Cops stopped Weiland 32 as he stood near a ""No Trespassing"" sign at an Avenue D housing project and were dumbfounded when he explained ""No Im not visiting anyone. I just bought drugs."" Weiland recently reunited with the popular Stone Temple Pilots to prepare for a summer tour faces a month in jail if he doesnt keep up his four-times-a-week outpatient treatments and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Hes currently on probation in California for similar drug-possession charges.

Seth Rogen and James Franco are certainly that in ""Pineapple Express"" dudes who can be chronically entertaining until the last joint is passed. However the buzzkill comes when the rest of the movie intrudes. Watching good buds riff wears out its welcome after a half hour and thats where a story really comes in handy. But when ""Pineapple"" goes from ganja to genre it sours. Rogen is Dale Denton whose film noir-ish name fits his job as an L.A. process server. His 18-year-old girlfriend (Amber Heard) is a high school senior something 25-year-old Dale is fine with as long as he doesnt have to meet her parents. So he goes to hang with Saul (Franco) his pajama-pants-wearing dealer whos as potted as his livelihood. After Dale witnesses a murder he fears Sauls distinctive ""Pineapple Express"" weed will provide the killers a road map right to them. The dudes have reason to be paranoid so they hit the road - though not too far since they need to protect Dales girlfriend and mainly keep lighting up. Seth Rogen and James Franco smoke it up in Pineapple Express Deliberately shambling and irritatingly amateur this movie proves that when Rogen hit it big with ""Knocked Up"" and got on the Judd Apatow express he dug out every script he and co-writing buddy Evan Goldberg had. Some were good like last years ""Superbad"" (produced by Apatow who has a producer and story credit on ""PE"") and some needed polish which indie director David Gordon Green doesnt provide here. Sometimes that pays off as in a refreshingly off-kilter car chase. And Rogen and Franco - co-stars on Apatows great short-lived TV series ""Freaks and Geeks"" - can ramble on about nothing and itll be 20 times funnier than overscripted monstrosities like ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" or ""The Love Guru."" But to be blunt the movies aspiration to be the little doobie brother of ""The Big Lebowski"" doesnt click (a black-and-white prelude set in a 1937 military pot-testing lab is a very Coen brothers touch.) Having movie guys crack up in smoke has long been decriminalized but the much-too-muchness of ""Pineapple"" makes you hunger for less not more. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Seth Rogen from left James Franco and Danny McBride run for their lives in Pineapple Express. Photo DARREN MICHAELS The Pineapple Express 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Pineapple Express is lets be blunt a stoner movie. Its named for a type of weed so splendiferous and rare that lighting it up is like ""killing a unicorn."" Nurtured in a magical meteorological current that runs between Hawaii and Canada it is says its dealer ""the dopest dope I ever smoked."" He compares it to a remote metaphysical cavity of unknown location. Then he smokes it with a customer. They share a three-tipped T-shaped fattie called a ""cross-joint"" which he heralds as ""the future -- the apex of the vortex of joint engineering."" When he compares the inventor of the cross-joint with the guy who designed Madison Square Garden its clear that Pineapple Express is not your hippie uncles stoner movie Unless Im wrong Cheech amp; Chong never gave a shout-out to civil engineers. There are other differences between this and previous examples of the genre -- including 2008s The Wackness and Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay. They both had their moments -- and they both followed two pothead man-friends on life-defining quests -- but neither one offers the giddy chemistry and blissed-out comic highs of James Franco and Seth Rogen as Pineapples stumblebum users. Franco is Saul the dealer an amiable longhair who loves his Bubbe; Rogen is Dale the buyer a process server in a heinous tan suit. Together they stole my heart. One day Dale buys a quarter bag of the aforementioned amazing weed from Saul. He then goes off to serve papers on a fellow named Ted Jones (Gary Cole) showing up just in time to witness Ted and corrupt cop Carol (Rosie Perez) murder an Asian henchman for the regions No. 2 drug dealer. Ted it turns out is No. 1. Dale drops his joint and splits. Ted finds it and identifies it as Pineapple Express which Ted sold to one person Red (Danny McBride). Red sold it to one person Saul. Saul sold it to one person Dale. Uh-oh. Fans of last summers Superbad will spot the dirty thumbprints of screenwriter-producers Rogen Evan Goldberg and Judd Aptatow. If Superbad was a raucous adenoidal vision quest this one is its older smokier bloodier companion piece. Like everything Apatow touches its profane yet sentimental full of naughty words and misty platonic boy-bonding. The new element here is David Gordon Green a director best known for literate indie downers such as Snow Angels and Undertow. Green is obviously at ease with on-screen violence another element that differentiates Pineapple Express from most other gentle-junkie movies. People die. Injuries ooze. Body parts deform. (""My ear You killed my ear"" Close-up of mangled cartilage.) The single best line in the movie is also one of the cruelest ""You just got killed by a Daewoo Lanos (my friend)"" And a yellow one at that. The whole thing unspools with the archest self-awareness layering buddy-flick road-movie and action-comedy motifs on a genial pothead farce with unexpectedly murderous consequences. Our two hazy bumblers embark on wild car chases and bone-crunching fight scenes their moments of death and pathos set to grinding electric guitar. Is it a spoof? You bet its a spoof One character gets shot seven times and lives to crow about it in a gloriously absurd diner scene that closes the film. You neednt be a pothead to enjoy Pineapple Express -- the movie; I mean the movie -- and Dale does have his moment of clarity when he realizes hes ""not very functional"" when hes high. That said this isnt Reefer Madness. Its a film in which one grown man dates a teenager two grown men sell weed to schoolkids and a whole bunch of grown men vigorously circumvent American drug laws. But most of the time I laughed my head off and I was sober as a judge. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals The Mel Brooks Collection on Blu-ray for 25 + pickup at Best Buy GNC Mega Men Sport 90-Count Multivitamins for 9 + free shipping SanDisk 128GB Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive for 20 + pickup at...

If you believe so (and I do) you could rightly point to a handful of factors. The comedies he produces overflow with raunch -- with dialogue so nasty its downright skanky and with skank-outrage behavior to match. In addition to being obscene as hell his films are thrillingly and madly literate a jumble of pop culture scholasticism and white-boy hip-hop jargon that is intricate enough to erase the line between stoopid and genius. And at a time when Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise cant be guaranteed to open a film Apatow has created a revenge-of-the-nerds alternate universe in which an actor who looks like Seth Rogen can become a movie star. But theres an additional factor of subversion at play. Knocked Up was just a glorified sitcom but starting with the inspired Superbad and then with the underrated Forgetting Sarah Marshall Apatow has presided over movies that have no plots -- that spill forward with casual abandon wandering down blind alleys and turning those alleys into full-blown highways which twist and turn with the rambling stoned logic of 70s movies. Pineapple Express does that quite literally since its the tale of two happy seemingly harmless potheads who get caught in a world of murderous crime. Dale Denton (Rogen) is a process server (he delivers subpoenas for a living) but basically he spends his days driving around and getting high smoking the dope he buys from his trusted dealer Saul Silver (James Franco) a long-haired slacker in an ancient Jaws T-shirt and striped pajamas who is so perpetually blasted he can never see past the next moment. (This is either a state of wreckage or a state of grace depending on your vantage.) For a while as the two sit around Sauls living room trying out his latest shipment of a super-dynamite weed called Pineapple Express the movie is amusing in a verbally dissociated been-there-toked-that way. Rogen and Franco make an amiably wacked comedy team -- its like watching a buddy film with Albert Brooks and Joe Dallesandro. But then Dale heads off from Sauls apartment bag of dope in hand and when hes parked in front of another dealers home (its Sauls supplier in fact) he witnesses a murder. Before long the two are being pursued by hitmen cops and God knows who else and the film turns crazy and bloody violent -- without ever quite violating its goofy stoner vibe. Pineapple Express is a fitfully amusing tale of drugs and crooks and general dilapidation but the more it goes on and the loopier it gets the less it connects with experience. It becomes Apatows hash-bar version of a cynical action joyride. The director David Gordon Green is the last filmmaker on earth one would have expected to work with Apatow -- hes a creator of somberly beautiful and austere American art films (Snow Angels All the Real Girls) -- but he brings the movie his own loping run-on style which turns out to be a perfect expression of the stoner rhythm. Green knows whats funny about potheads Theyre always trying to think and act straight. Saul is a sweet kid who worries about his ""bubbe"" (i.e. grandma) and Franco through his slurry daze makes him an amusing hipster-autodidact -- he knows just how to hit a five-dollar word like trifecta. And the more weed Dale smokes the more Rogen gives him a demented clarity. Dale another of Apatows sheepish man-kids is dating a high school senior (Amber Heard) which would be gross if the film didnt see it as a pathetic expression of arrested development. As Red the suppliers middleman who becomes the comrade of our heroes Danny McBride is the McLovin of the group with a quizzical cluelessness that hilariously shreds his pretense of ""danger."" Theres one excruciatingly funny sequence in which Saul literally in the drivers seat is cruising along at top speed with his foot smashed through the windshield the perfect stoned action posture. But as Pineapple Express turns into a deranged vehicle of slapstick mayhem with people getting smashed in the head with coffeepots its charm begins to ebb away. The movie wants to be a jolly dope spree turned nightmare -- just because youre paranoid doesnt mean that vicious thugs arent trying to dismember you -- but it ends up subverting its own subversion arriving at a place that can only be called conventional.

Probably someone did when Cheech and Chong first lit up in ""Up in Smoke"" (1978) and repeated it again and again straight on through to the current Harold and Kumar romps. ""Pineapple Express"" puts ""the bud"" in the buddy flick. We dont mean beer. And while this R-rated comedy is oh so lite it also builds to some endearingly goofball conclusions about friendship and maybe just maybe responsibility. Though theres a hazy quality to the latter. Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg (""Superbad"") with producer Judd Apatow in on the storys inception the action comedy finds customer Dale (Rogen) and toasted dealer Saul (James Franco) on the lam from a drug kingpin and his cop accomplice (Gary Cole and Rosie Perez). A process server with a bag of tricks and some odd costumes in the trunk of his car Dale thought he was just going to deliver a subpoena. Instead he witnesses a gang murder. He panics tosses his smoldering joint. The impossibly rare weed of the title leads back to Saul and him. Because mortal danger doesnt break a habit the duos getaway is less than focused and often funny. They inhale they bicker they ruminate fuzzily. Saul spends time wondering what he should do with his aged grandmother. Dale hopes to become a talk-radio personality. The 25-five-year-old is trying to keep his high school girlfriend happy without really coming through for her. Dale and Saul werent exactly friends at the start of their misadventure. The script is savvy about the depth or shallowness of those cordial relationships built on illicit exchange. Dale is clearer. Saul who should be were he a businessman is emotionally confused. Yet when Dales volatile relationship conversations come -- and of course they do -- you can guess which carries more truth and hurt feelings the phoner with his girlfriend or the one with hapless Saul. Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson play two hit men with an equally fraught friendship. Rogen delivers his best lines as throwaways. Franco is sweet if a little faux when it comes to capturing the stoner fog. Danny McBride does scene-stealing work as Red middleman between Saul and drug lord Ted. This summers McLovin Red brings a cumulative super-odd hilarity to the movie. ""Pineapple Express"" begins with a black-and-white prologue set in the 40s. Forget alien abductions and their conspiracies this is the real skinny on clandestine operations. Still the films earliest curve ball took place long before the movie started production. Director David Gordon Green a critical darling on the festival circuit is known for his regionally pungent dramas like ""All the Real Girls"" and most recently ""Snow Angels."" Fans of Greens aesthetic will recognize it most in a scene in which he and go-to cinematographer Tim Orr capture Dale and Saul toking joking and all manner of nonsense in a wooded area. Its funny sad and very careless. Its also got a strange joy to it. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Once more Seth Rogens red-rimmed half-shut eyes peek out from beneath his tousled Jewfro. No longer schlepping home electronics (The 40 Year Old Virgin) or dicking around with a porn website (Knocked Up) hes got a real job now--as a process server. Its a gig his Dale Denton likes because it allows him plenty of time to smoke weed in his car visit his high-school girlfriend and play dress-up. (Dale pays homage to Chevy Chases Fletch by delivering subpoenas to a doctor while swaddled in surgical scrubs.)Joining Rogen again years after NBC flunked their Freaks and Geeks in the midst of its one majestic season is James Franco once more cast as his pal and pusher. Francos Saul Silver is the worlds loneliest dope dealer who spends his hours giggling to 227 reruns and hanging with his bubbe at the retirement home. Hes a mensch this one offering the latest and greatest in marijuana hybrids Pineapple Express which smells ""like Gods vagina"" and smokes ""like killing a unicorn."" Its this very strain of sticky icky that eventually lands the tandem in trouble as Dale witnesses a murder committed by a dealer (Gary Cole the master of deadpan dumbass cool) and a corrupt cop (Rosie Perez)--and leaves behind a roach that Coles character can ID by taste and smell. In short order the dopes are on the run dodging bullets wrecking cars . . . and falling in love with each other as men are wont to do in Apatow productions.But thats just superficial stuff the noise and nonsense of a plot thats beside the point. Pineapple Express is indeed a savvy nod to 1980s action comedies down to the Huey Lewis original that plays over the end credits. But its greatest achievements lie in the tossed-off non sequiturs the pop-culture (and Scott Baio) allusions and the unexpected respites in the midst of all the bang-bang-boom. Though the screenplay was penned by Rogen and pal Evan Goldberg--the duo whose Superbad was super so-so and super long--much credit must also be given to director David Gordon Green a heretofore beloved arthouse craftsman whose last few films suggested an ache to bust out of the indieplex.The insertion of Green into the now-familiar mix transforms Pineapple Express from the inevitable into the unexpected. Green and longtime cinematographer Tim Orr dont act like theyre making an action movie; as far as they appear to be concerned this is an idyllic romance occasionally interrupted by fisticuffs gunplay or car chases--all of which are rendered with a realists eye for detail no matter how violently grim or glazed-eye goofy. The Pineapple Express trailer had all the warning signs of a kingdom out of control--the Superbad boys unleashed in a maddening haze of pot smoke Cheech and Chong locked and loaded. Instead Green and Orr bring surprising elegance to the proceedings. A scene during which Rogen and Franco play leapfrog in the woods is textbook Malick--a wondrous poetic detour in a film thats eventually nothing but left turns.Dale and Saul begin the film as strangers who do little more than conduct the occasional business transaction. But in a film mostly bereft of women theirs becomes a full-blown love affair built upon accidental proposals (""Imagine I gave you a handjob . . . got you a handjob"") that blossom into dry humping. Even their fights are foreplay especially a brilliantly staged brawl pitting Dale and Saul against the dope-pushing middleman named Red--played by Danny McBride who delivers gibberish with an authoritys conviction. Three men whove never thrown a single punch in their entire lives brutally lay into each other usually with a flick or kick to the nuts. The Rogen-Apatow collaboration has come a long way from the ""You know I know youre gay"" riffing in Virgin; at last theyre out of the closet.And dont be fooled by its head-shop appeal Pineapple Express like Knocked Up but ultimately much much better is a stoners movie that ultimately decides its time to put down the Bong Mitzvah (a water pipe purchased in Tel Aviv natch) and get shit done. ""We are not very functional when were high"" Dale tells Saul as theyre on the verge of a more-or-less breakup; he dreams not of serving subpoenas but of hosting a talk-radio show. The thought appalls Saul who earlier was convinced that a car tuned to talk radio had committed suicide. But Saul has dreams too ""I want to design septic tanks for playgrounds."" At last a Judd Apatow production worth memorizing.

"Pineapple Express | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pineapple-express ) Pineapple Express (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli It has been said that the only way to truly enjoy a stoner comedy is to smoke a joint before watching it. Considering the quality of some of the movies wedded to this genre Im tempted to believe that. Thankfully Pineapple Express is an exception. The humor in this movie is smart enough that even a moderate level of intoxication or inebriation is not necessary to enjoy it. Sure some of the jokes fall flat and others never get off the ground but there are enough genuinely funny moments to be found in the slightly-too-long 111 minutes to make it a pleasant way to pass an afternoon or evening. The primary audience for this film might be those who partake from time to time but its not the only audience. Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a process server. His idea of a good day is to deliver a few summons some a few joints and spend a few minutes with his high school girlfriend Angie (Amber Heard). Dale isnt what one calls a social guy - his best friend is his drug dealer Saul (James Franco). One unfortunate evening Dale witnesses a murder while on his way to deliver a summons. The killers a drug lord (Gary Cole) and a crooked female cop (Rosie Perez) see a need to eliminate Dale. After obtaining a roach he leaves behind at the scene tracking him becomes simple. His marijuana of choice is called ""Pineapple Express"" and theres only one dealer in the area Saul. Pretty soon Dale and Saul are on the run from a group of not-too-bright hitmen. Comic timing is everything in a movie like this and actors Seth Rogen and James Franco exhibit it. Perhaps the surprise is how good director David Gordon Green is with the material. Green whose impeccable indie credentials include George Washington and All the Real Girls would not seem to be the best choice for this stoner/male bonding comedy but he ""gets"" it and delivers. A lot of the best humor comes from double-takes one-liners and other less flamboyant gestures and Green and his actors sail through these moments with seeming effortlessness. Of course theres some over-the-top coarse stuff as well and thats handled with equal adeptness. Part of the reason Pineapple Express works is due to the screenplay (by Rogen and Evan Goldberg with an assist from Judd Apatow) but one can still imagine an inept cast and crew making a mess out of it. Pineapple Express is the movie that Harold and Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay could have been had it focused a little less on the scatological least-common-denominator humor. This movie shows that stoner comedies dont have to be laid back and lazy even though some of their characters might be. Even though this movie comes out of Judd Apatows shop theres no nudity upsetting Apatows goal to put a penis in every flick. Lack of overt sex and nudity nothwithstanding the movie earns its R-rating with plenty of raunchy language blatant innuendo and violence. For those who dont think gore can be funny consider the scene in Pulp Fiction where Vincent splatters brains all over the inside of a car. That kind of comedy has a place here. Many of the Apatow crews previous efforts have been romantic comedies. Pineapple Express is not at least not in the strictest sense. Instead its a buddy movie but it has fun italicizing the homoerotic undertones that characterize many such films. When you consider it a lot of buddy films arent fundamentally that different from romantic comedies. The relationships are often developed in the same fashion only with male bonding replacing sexual chemistry. Pineapple Express recognizes this and has some fun with the concept. Dale and Saul may not be gay but they sure act like it upon occasion. Pineapple Express takes some chances and gets some laughs through unconventional casting choices. Seth Rogen has proven his comic chops recently but James Franco lately having spent a lot of his screen time in Spider-Man movies is not what one immediately thinks of as a higher functioning Jay (as in ""Jay and Silent Bob""). Then theres Rosie Perez as a corrupt cop with a memorable and off-the-wall cameo for Ed Begley Jr. Pineapple Express is a little too long and the big action set piece toward the end is too bloated for an otherwise tightly focused motion picture. These arent big complaints however. In the end the film is solid entertainment in the Midnight Run vein.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint An improbable jumble of bumbling romance frenetic bloodshed giddy slapstick cockeyed cannabis jokes and a pair of half-wasted stoners as crime-fighting heroes ""Pineapple Express"" is the unlikeliest comedy of the summer. Its also going to be one of the best-loved. Action comedies usually fly by at a manic car-smashing pace but this shaggy-dog story (by star Seth Rogen and his ""Superbad"" writing partner Evan Goldberg) ambles from one absurd turn of affairs to the next while paying plenty of attention to giggly character notes. Its buddy-buddy elements are the emotional bedrock supporting the films considerable action shenanigans. This time the stakes arent financial but emotional. How the characters feel about each other at the fadeout matters more than who makes off with a bundle of loot. Rogen brings his teddy bear amiability to the role of Dale Denton a Los Angeles legal-process server who ambles through his humdrum workday in a cumulus cloud of cannabis. ""Youre a servant?"" marvels his dope dealer Saul Silver (James Franco blissfully zonked in every scene). ""Like a chauffeur? A butler?"" Francos performance is inspired. You can almost see empty thought balloons floating over his characters head. Saul who conducts his business behind a multi-locked door is a rather isolated dude just bright enough to suspect that people like him for the mind-blowing product he sells rather than for himself. He invites the likable Dale to hang around hoping to kindle a friendship over a cross-shaped superjoint though Dale would rather finish his deliveries and catch up with his impossibly hot 18-year-old girlfriend. His next stop turns Dale into a mob-murder witness and a man on the run. The killer finds Dales castoff joint traces the uniquely potent weed back to Saul and comes after the duo with a cadre of comically menacing goons. PINEAPPLE EXPRESS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language drug use sexual references and violence. What follows is a succession of chases as the fugitives make their escape with the spur-of-the-moment randomness of the truly stoned. While their survival is the dramatic mainspring of the story the emotional bedrock is how the small quirky details of their personalities mesh to launch an unexpected friendship. Sauls puppy-dog neediness whittles away at Dales kvetchy defenses and director David Gordon Greens delight at the rapport between his two stars is contagious. The bulky Rogen and slender Franco have an offbeat chemistry thats utterly engaging. Be aware though that this is one unapologetically violent movie. The R-rated action is pitched at a level of fun alarming sadism -- the ridiculously cruel bloodshed intends to thrill and it succeeds a running parody of sledgehammer crime thrillers. Rogens Dale serves as a bemused Greek chorus commenting on the action as it erupts all around him. The destruction escalates from trashing the apartment of a boastful drug connection (Danny McBride the films comedic ace in the hole) to a climax as kaboom-filled as any breakneck summer multiplex release. Green twists the tone expertly however; even the most bruising fight sequences feel like explosions of high spirits. The bicker-and-bond allegiance that emerges between Rogen Franco and McBride may be illogical but its a treat nevertheless. Its a rare thriller that ends with the idea that intimacy is lifes greatest treasure but this one does and its likely to put a lump in your throat even as you chuckle.

In that vein Pineapple Express definitely has a minor feel a not-quite-finished-and-nobody-cares vibe as befits its stoner story line. For a movie with a high action content (and body count oddly enough) it meanders along happily stumbling from one scene to another. You dont have to be high to enjoy it although who knows maybe it wouldnt hurt. Whatever the case its a different kind of movie for the Apatow clan (hes one of the producers). Although it is like many of his films a small-scale Freaks and Geeks reunion the director David Gordon Green is known for such indie fare as All the Real Girls and Snow Angels. Bringing him aboard is like asking Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth to join the Rolling Stones. You take a chance that hell lose whatever spark made you love him in the first place but theres also the possibility hell shake up the well-oiled machine. Its somewhat more of the latter than the former in this case but its not as if Green has shaken the genre to its core. He does however take the film to different more violent places. Seth Rogen stars as Dale Denton pretty much the same character from Apatow films that weve grown to love only this time he has a job. Which doesnt mean hes the picture of ambition. Hes a process server dating a barely legal high-school girl. One possible impediment to his life journey He gets high all the time. He is in fact firing up a joint when he happens to see Gary Cole aided by cop Rosie Perez shoot a guy in the back of the head. Yes. Shoot a guy in the back of the head. In a Judd Apatow comedy. Its not as if comedy and violence cant mix - 48 Hrs. is a great film and has plenty of both - but it is jarring. Particularly for Dale who naturally scurries over to the home of his marijuana dealer Saul Silver (James Franco). Saul supplied him with some ultra-high-grade pot called Pineapple Express - so rare that Cole can figure out from the joint Dale tossed at the crime scene who sold it to him. From there its a surprisingly violent chase film with Coles bad guys after Dale and Saul who are as spectacularly inept at fleeing as they are at everything else. Theyre sometimes joined by Red (Danny McBride of The Foot Fist Way and the upcoming Tropic Thunder - hes suddenly showing up everywhere) a man about as loyal as he is smart - not very. Some of the set pieces such as Dale and Sauls desperate adventures selling marijuana to middle-schoolers (few taboos are safe from these guys) or Dales relationship with his girlfriend and her family (Ed Begley Jr. has a blast literally as her dad) are hilarious. But the film rests as these films always do on an unlikely underlying sweetness. When it starts Dale and Sauls relationship is mostly business supply (Saul) and demand (Dale). By the end when theyre battered bruised and bong-hit it has become something more. Rogen is by now both comfortable and reliable in the sort-of schlubby everyman role; some of his biggest laughs come from disembodied lines heard while his character is off-screen reacting to Saul. And Franco eyes rarely ever more than half open captures the itll-all-work-out wait-Im-paranoid stoner attitude perfectly. Then theres McBride his Southern accent loud and proud selling out friends and enemies alike with an offhand glee that he makes believable. Hes a welcome addition to the fold. But the story meanders too much to really grab you in the way that Knocked Up or Superbad do. Sure youll laugh. Its funny. But your memories soon will be fuzzy a little out of whack and the next thing youll know youll have eaten an entire bag of Doritos. Or at least wish you had.

"In drug-addled Pineapple Express theres a lot to take in - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In drug-addled Pineapple Express theres a lot to take in Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / August 6 2008 The recipe for ""Pineapple Express"" is simple if thoroughly bizarre. Take one writer-producer (Judd Apatow) and one writer-star (Seth Rogen) known for bright raunchy hit comedies like ""Knocked Up"" and ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" Add one sensitive regional filmmaker (David Gordon Green of ""George Washington"" and ""All the Real Girls"") determined to have his Hollywood moment. Fold in that filmmakers unexpected love of 1980s action trash; really indefensible stuff like ""Tango amp; Cash."" Roll it all up in a big righteous Cheech and Chong doob and smoke it.Itd be nice to report that the results represent a new kind of fusion cinema or at the very least two hours of you-got-peanut-butter-on-my-chocolate inspiration. Disappointingly ""Pineapple Express"" is less than the sum of its ingredients even if its still a good stupid time at the movies. The intentional sloppiness makes for a nice change of pace in a summer of gleaming superhero machinery but in the end sloppy is sloppy.The films high point (nudge nudge) is probably the all-stops-out performance by James Franco heretofore best known as the cleanly pressed if psychotic Harry Osborn of the ""Spider-Man"" movies. Franco plays Saul Silver a pot dealer who exists in a constant state of addled hippie enthusiasm. (The title refers to his latest brand of awesome herb.) His customer and sort-of best friend is Dale Denton (Rogen) a teddy-bear burn-out who has an actual job (process server) and girlfriend (a high school beauty played by Amber Heard whom the movie introduces then mostly ignores).The first 20 minutes coast along on the fumes of Rogens established likability and the surprise of seeing Franco playing Sean Penns role from ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High."" The dialogue consists of amusingly stoned riffage fed by a deep love of junk nostalgia Eddy Grants ""Electric Avenue"" on the radio ""The Jeffersons"" on Sauls TV. This movie has the pop-culture munchies.Then the plot kicks in Dale witnesses a gangland rub-out by local drug kingpin Ted Jones (Gary Cole looking appropriately Mr. Big circa 1983) and his lady-cop lover and accomplice (Rosie Perez). Dale and Saul have to go on the lam and figure out how to survive which basically means they drive to the woods and fall asleep.The movie wont let them be though. Jones sends in a pair of over-caffeinated thugs played by Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson - Abbott and Costello doing a remake of ""Pulp Fiction."" Theres also Sauls supplier Red (dorky mullethead Danny R. McBride of the recent ""The Foot Fist Way"") whos sympathetic to the heroes even as hes selling them out to the bad guys. In one very funny sequence Saul and Dale have an epic fight with Red that trashes his crummy little house and the film suddenly seems as if its breaking out of its own frame.That scene effectively balances comedy and hellacious violence; other scenes not so much. There are high-speed car chases and bloody shoot-outs severed ears and shotgunned feet all filtered through Greens indie-dozy sensibility which in turn is filtered through Apatow and Rogens smart frat-boy anarchy. Thats too much filtering The results are tasteless in more than one sense.It is fun to see Rogen play at being the action hero though and his climactic punch-up with Cole is refreshingly ugly the way fights are in the real world but rarely in the movies. Franco is consistently funny as a guy who doesnt find reality interesting enough to check in very often. Green even pulls off a few excellent sight gags the most cheering of which involves Saul trying to kick out the Slurpee-covered windshield of a stolen police car at 60 miles per hour.What doesnt work is the scripts insistence that Dale and Saul strengthen their emotional bond over the course of the movie. Apatows films have a thing for straight-guy romance - for the way buddies can fall out and make up - and ""Pineapple Express"" at times plays like ""Superbad"" with live ammunition.Thats finally one element too many. Guys youre asking us to swallow a pot farce a buddy thriller an action parody and a touching tale of two men on the run? You must be high.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY If the guys from Superbad smoked too much weed in college never got their diplomas and continued to find themselves in absurd situations they might grow up to become the paranoid pothead trio in Pineapple Express (   1/2 out of four). This bawdy stoner comedy about a couple days in the life of three foolish dudes feels like a relative of last summers hit about a trio of inept guys. Fans of Superbad will enjoy Pineapple Express. Its a similar sweet-silly buddy comedy where everything that can go wrong does. A scene with a stolen police car that leads to a pot-fueled chase is side-splittingly funny. Where alcohol infused many of the antics in Superbad Pineapple Express is decidedly smoke-enshrouded. Descending from a comic tradition begun by Cheech and Chong and continued by Bill and Ted and Harold and Kumar the two at the center of all the dopey business dont exactly have names that reek of cool. Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) is a process server with a decidedly lazy streak. His dealer Saul Silver (James Franco) offers him a rare new strain of marijuana called Pineapple Express. This super-powerful blend is so special and rare ""its almost a shame to smoke it"" Saul says. ""Its like killing a unicorn."" This exchange between dealer and druggie leads to a series of unfortunate events that culminates in a cartoonish shootout. Rogen and Franco have great comic chemistry. The initial scenes in Francos apartment are absurdly funny and establish their whacked-out friendship. Franco is a revelation. We knew Rogen was funny but Franco is hilarious. He is the perfect stoned buffoon as he waxes about an oddly constructed ""cross joint."" ""This is the future. This is like the apex of the vortex of joint technology. This is what your grandchildren are going to be smoking."" Also prankishly funny is Sauls double-crossing buddy Red played by Danny McBride whose star is on the rise after his turns as a lame-brained tae kwon do instructor in The Foot Fist Way and a crazed explosives expert in the upcoming Tropic Thunder. Producer Judd Apatow excels at this sort of raunchy but good-natured post-adolescent tale and has wisely allied himself with smart quirky filmmakers. Director David Gordon Green whose last film was the somber character study Snow Angels shows a definite talent for gut-busting comedy. You dont have to be in an altered state to appreciate the ludicrous humor. The laughs -- mostly crude profane and drug-addled -- are almost non-stop. (Rated R for pervasive language drug use sexual references and language. Running time 1 hour 51 minutes. Opens in some theaters tonight and nationwide Wednesday.)

But so does most pot. _ By David Edelstein Published Aug 4 2008 ShareThis (Photo Darren Michaels/Courtesy of Columbia Pictures) The latest gagfest from the Judd Apatow Boys Club Factory Pineapple Express throws gross-out violence into the usual mix of substance abuse and raunch; its like an R-rated Three Stooges comedy with Moe ripping bloody chunks from Larrys scalp and poking out Curlys eyes. Seth Rogen who co-wrote the film with Evan Goldberg is Dale Denton a pothead process-server who witnesses a (brain-spattering) drug-related murder and lams it with his addled dealer Saul (James Franco). Theres a what-the-hell nihilistic quality to all the doping and slapstick and gore that can bedepending on your mood and biochemistryvery appealing. But Pineapple Express unlike Rogen and Goldbergs triumphant last effort Superbad is a tad deficient in the human-feeling department. Its empty and formulaic with plotting thats lazy even by stoner-comedy standards. Without all the yuck-o sight gags it would be a huge bummer. With them of course it will be a gargantuan dog-days hit; the audience I saw it with (mostly real people not press) got a contact high from all the head-bashing and bone-crunching. I cackled a fair bit too. Theres a fight between Rogen and Danny McBride as the infantile dealers dealer (one rung below the homicidal kingpin) thats great fun if you like watching fat spazzes throw each other over furniture. And Franco is fabulous. In loose striped pants his hair long and floppy he shows off his radiant good nature; even his irritability carries a wisp of childlike wonder. Some bad decadesheroin overdoses the crack-cocaine epidemictook a lot of the whoopee out of drug humor and its nice to be able to laugh again at people hacking up the contents of their lungs over humongous doobies. Good times. BACKSTORY When the red-band trailer for Pineapple Express leaked to YouTube Entertainment Weekly flooded the zone posting back-to-back articles suggesting that Apatow himself was the leaker and that Sony pulled it out of fear that the clip seemed to be endorsing marijuana use to minors. If you type in your name date of birth and Zip Code you can enter the restricted section of the official site and watch for yourself. How inflammatory is it? We see drugs with paraphernalia a blissful Rogen driving while smoking pot a midwestern woman dropping the F-bomb and most memorably Franco comparing the smell of pot to the scent of Gods vagina. Its too bad the supposedly turbocharged grass that Dale and Saul smoke (its called Pineapple Express) unleashes no special powers; its doesnt seem much different from the Hawaiian stuff that screwed up my sophomore year of college. In any case the Apatow Factory takes an opportunistic attitude toward drugs Wring as many gags out of them as possible then make it clear that the heroes must set aside their bongs and spliffs and take responsibility for their (and their dependents) lives. (It was entertaining to watch right-wing moralists tie themselves in knots over Knocked Up Its pro-lifenever mind the promiscuity and drugs) In Pineapple Express the dysfunctional hero summons the will to descend on the underground lair of the kingpin (Gary Cole) and his spunky bad-cop sidekick (Rosie Perez) to save the life of his friend so in 90 minutes we go from Cheech and Chong to Die Hard. In Knocked Up Rogens unself-conscious jabber had a hilarious charge The more he rationalized his inadequacies the lower your jaw dropped. Here that jabber feels like shtickand with all the echoes of Albert Brooks secondhand shtick. Dale has a very cute blonde high-school girlfriend but its even harder to fathom her attraction to him than it was Katherine Heigls. This is a very insular universe arrested in some creepy (but financially bounteous) pubescent twilight zone. When Dale carries the limp Saul from a burning building (it echoes Superbads climax) its anyones guess if Rogen and Goldberg mean to underline or parody the homoeroticism of buddy pictures. The director David Gordon Green makes a gung ho leap here from glacial indie art pictures (George Washington Snow Angels) to the land of mainstream slob-comedy; the only distinctive touch he brings is wide-screen framing which means a lot of dead space on the sides. But apart from a promising prologue with Bill Hader as a thirties marijuana test subject the whole movie is dead space. In Hot Fuzz the British team of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead) mixed parody and gore in ways that made wheezy action-movie conventions feel invigoratingly strange. But Wright and Peggs comedy is rooted in a real place. Apatow and Rogens hails from a never-never land where fat stoners can play with guns and hit the bulls-eye. Elegy is a spare melancholy film that is so far in spirit from its source Philip Roths The Dying Animal that Im tempted to say we should abandon altogether the idea of adapting Roth. (Id suggest Charlie Kaufman take a stab except he made us watch him jump through hoops over Susan Orlean ) Its not that Roths novels are too solipsistic; its that their solipsism is a Versailles-size hall of mirrorsendlessly doubling back and endlessly refracted. The Dying Animalthe third book to feature David Kepesh who first appeared in The Professor of Desire (1977)is a brief (for Roth) masterpiece that for all its twists and flashbacks and cultural musings reads as if its coming out in one urgent breath. The narrator has fancied himself carnality incarnate with sex his revenge against the America of his youth (still in a Puritan stranglehold) and against death. (He is that explicit.) Now in his sixties his body failing his sex drive more fierce than ever hes going back in his mind to the anti-puritanical 1960s when he asserted his freedom by ditching his wife and son and taking student lover after student lover. His latest Consuela might be his lastin any case shes the first hes terrified of losing before he gets her into the sack. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Dale Robinette/Columbia Pictures hide caption toggle caption Dale Robinette/Columbia Pictures But on one extraordinarily awful day the two run from corrupt police officers and narrowly escape explosions. Dale Robinette/Columbia Pictures Even if stoner comedies Apatow comedies and R-rated comedy-thrillers arent really your thing you may still be won over by James Franco in Pineapple Express. His hair a shaggy mane his clothes rumpled and mismatched his eyes glazed and bloodshot -- and nonetheless puppy-dog plaintive -- he could hardly be scruffier as the perpetually stoned Saul Silver. Or more affably adorably appealing. Francos Saul gets introduced to the audience in a drug deal so laid-back it almost doesnt happen He offers stoned process-server Dale Denton (Seth Rogen) a taste of the titular weed and they both promptly get lost in a smoky breeze-shooting haze. Pineapple Express see is a blend of high-grade marijuana so rare that smoking it seems almost a shame to Saul -- ""like killing a unicorn"" -- and in his addled state the very fact that hes sharing it makes him certain that he and Dale must have become close friends. The dope is also rare enough that a smoldering joint Dale drops in panic -- as he witnesses a murder committed by a drug lord and a crooked cop -- gets traced back to Saul. Which means the two have to go on the lam thereafter. Hilarity and a good deal of violence ensue. And while the violence is what separates this film from the stoner comedies that preceded it this summer (as well as the Cheech amp; Chong epics of yesteryear) its generally as comic as it is distressing whether it involves an earlobe being shot off or a deliriously clumsy fistfight among three stoners -- none of whom has ever before thrown a punch. Director David Gordon Green whos previously specialized in indie dramas of a far more serious stripe proves adept at knockabout farce. He also brings an artists eye to scenic composition in a genre not really known for cinematic deftness. An isolated barn looks as striking here as it would in a film by Terrence Malick -- never mind that whats happening inside that barn is slapstick of a sort Blake Edwards would appreciate. Pineapple Express is probably the most artful of the Apatow Factory comedies so far but thats not to suggest it doesnt take being sweetly dumb just as seriously as the rest. What fun would a comedy about dope be after all if it werent dopey?

Putting a violent spin on the ""Superbad"" formula (envelope-pushing raunch plus unexpectedly sweet affirmations of male friendship) ""Pineapple Express"" emerges as a fitfully funny tonally trippy but not entirely satisfying effort from the Judd Apatow comic fraternity. Featuring Seth Rogen and a scene-stealing James Franco as two pot-addled losers on the run from a ruthless dealer director David Gordon Greens first mainstream venture is an unruly literally half-baked hybrid of bloody hijinks and stoner laughs. A well-earned R rating shouldnt keep auds from riding this ""Express"" train to a quick summer high with endless potential for dope-enhanced viewing on DVD. In a considerable departure from such melancholy mood-pieces as ""George Washington"" and ""All the Real Girls"" indie auteur Green here displays a thoroughly commercial sensibility that nonetheless benefits from his knack for tonal experimentation and strong visual sense. This is certainly one of the better-looking efforts to come off the Apatow assembly line composed in crisp widescreen images by d.p. Tim Orr whose poetic lensing in Greens previous films helped earn the director comparisons to Terrence Malick. But production values are somewhat beside the point when the movie in question is more ""Harold amp; Kumar"" than ""Badlands."" Scripted by the ""Superbad"" team of Rogen and Evan Goldberg this rambunctious paean to pot retains the trademark Apatow sweetness even as it careens from messy vulgarisms to even messier violence. As chubby schlub Dale Denton Rogen offers a slightly more presentable version of the chubby schlub he played in ""Knocked Up."" When hes not delivering court subpoenas or romancing barely legal high schooler Angie (Amber Heard) Dale buys weed from Saul Silver (Franco) -- a long-haired layabout who in an amusingly protracted sequence of smoking and shooting the breeze with Dale immediately wins over the audience with his affable perpetually stoned demeanor and often hilarious non sequiturs. While Dale tries to keep the relationship strictly professional Saul likes his client enough to sell him some Pineapple Express a high-grade form of marijuana so rare that in Sauls words ""its almost a shame to smoke it; its like killing a unicorn."" So rare in fact that when Dale witnesses a murder committed by evil drug lord Ted Jones (Gary Cole) and leaves behind a joint while fleeing the scene Ted almost immediately traces the half-smoked doobie back to Saul. Now on the run from Teds goons (Kevin Corrigan and Craig Robinson) Dale and Saul embark on a long weird pot-fueled odyssey that serves up plenty of slapstick antics and gruesome misadventures in between requisite bouts of male bonding. From a fierce scuffle with Sauls traitorous buddy Red (Danny McBride) to a mortifying first encounter with Angies parents (Ed Begley Jr. Nora Dunn) Green repeatedly pushes druggy banter and awkward exchanges past the point of discomfort into full-throttle aggression; in addition to its many nasty instances of stabbing shooting groin-kicking and head-smashing the pic offers perhaps the most graphic case of ear mutilation since ""Reservoir Dogs."" Beyond that neither the comedy nor the carnage warrant further Quentin Tarantino comparisons. Some choice lines aside too much of the humor is predicated on the notion that watching others get high is inherently funny (unless the viewer happens to be in a similar state its not). And while its genre-blurring may seem audacious by studio standards in the end ""Pineapple Express"" still feels too safe too constrained by buddy-comedy uplift to have any real bite. Ironically the stakes seemed higher the test of the central duos bond more wrenching in the far less eventful ""Superbad."" At the same time the pics feel-good aura is undeniably part of its appeal rooted in the chemistry of its two leads. As the more rational stressed-out Dale Rogen makes a perfectly panicky foil to Franco who delivers a hugely likable turn as a genial bum whos lonely at heart and loyal to the core. McBride also scores laughs as the corruptible but surprisingly resilient Red. Pic comes saddled with a cautionary warning against pot -- specifically its effects on the arrested male adolescents that will make up its target demo -- that feels both appropriate and a bit disingenuous. Aside from some playful scene transitions and a 1937-set prologue shot in lustrous black-and-white the pro tech package shows little of Greens signature retro style.
