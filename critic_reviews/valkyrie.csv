Cruise plays Col. Claus von Stauffenberg a Good German famous to his countrymen for his resistance to the Nazi mandate but less known among Americans. Trained as a loyal soldier the well-bred officers disgust at his Fuhrers leadership deepened following severe wounds suffered during battle in Tunisia where he lost a hand and an eye. And the assassination plan and subsequent government transition that Stauffenberg devised with help from a network of dissident army officers and political leaders was an audacious blend of suspenseful daring and wonkish political strategy. History confirms of course that the July 20 1944 operation failed when a bomb planted in Hitlers presence did too little damage; the Nazi leader survived with minor scratches army loyalists quelled the coup and Stauffenberg suffered the consequences along with scores of others. But Valkyrie as field-commanded by director Bryan Singer succeeds on its own terms as a handsome hybrid of conspiracy thriller and history lesson of Mission Impossible and The Day of the Jackal. The movie (with an uncluttered screenplay by Singers old pal Usual Suspects scripter Christopher McQuarrie along with Nathan Alexander) is less interested in why these men Stauffenberg in particular decided to take such risks than in staging how they might have looked when they met in tight secretive groups to plot and smoke cigarettes. But they do look good devising a new world order in rooms often lit with a touch of amber and outdoor scenes almost always shaded in the metallic palette of guns and steel. The mechanics of the actual plot are pretty amazing. Singer has assembled a top-notch international cast -- with Tom Wilkinson Bill Nighy Kenneth Branagh Terence Stamp and Eddie Izzard among the British invasion -- and given them leave to speak their lines with the accents they brought from home. And in the middle standing straight as a Top Gun ace is Tom Cruise that quintessentially self-constructed American movie star speaking in quintessential American tones as he declares ""We have to kill Hitler."" Cue the trumpets. B Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

But help is at hand in Valkyrie Tom Cruise doesnt  just set out to beat the Boche but to save the great British Sunday.Its surprising that Hollywood never got around to making an all-star epic about the plot of July 1944 in which a group of disgruntled generals led by the aristocratic von Stauffenberg (Cruise) attempted to off the Fuhrer and rescue Germanys reputation. The failure of the assassination plan and the attempted coup that followed marked the end of organised Germanic resistance to Hitlers regime.Director Bryan Singer takes a staunchly old-school approach assembling a cast of reliable British thesps and dividing the action between swastika-adorned wood-panelled offices and rainswept shadowy Berlin streets. The period is exactingly recreated with the camera lingering lovingly over leather jackboots snarling dogs and those fetishistic immaculately starched uniforms. Valkyrie has serious flaws the script by Nathan Alexander and Singers longtime compadre Christopher McQuarrie takes an age to get going and steers clear of any moral ambiguity. Too many of the prestigious cast -  notably Kenneth Branagh and token female Carice van Houten -  are underused and the accents are simply ludicrous with Cruises mid-American drawl sitting awkwardly alongside Branaghs cultured RP and the Fuhrers Teutonic whine. But as old-fashioned historical escapism goes this is solid compelling stuff.

Its a very straightforward film about a bonafide historical event. Some critics have called the film boring. If the actors and script had leaned more towards the sensational; the critics more than likely would have said it was over the top. It is neither but rather strikes a nice balance between drama and realism. Ive never been a Tom Cruise fan; but I try to give any performer a chance to show what he can do. This may be the best work Tom Cruise has ever done. The whole cast was excellent; as were the other aspects of the film. Some of the settings were gorgeous; and for the most part seemed quite authentic. They should since many of them were filmed in actual historical locations. The greatest movie ever made ? Why no but good enough that it entered my Top Ten today. The whole cast and crew have my sincere respect and admiration. A single tear trickled from my eye as I witnessed the inevitable fate of the rebel soldiers.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyMar 5 2009MichaelFeaturedOne of the best films Ive seen in a long time.

Historical accuracy and controversy aside the film was interesting enough in that it offered a different kind of WW2 film than we usually get from Hollywood. Germans are typically confined to the bad guy roles in WW2 films so it was a refreshing change to see them portray the heroes this time around. However as a film Valkyrie was let down by a lack of action or suspense. Perhaps developing the supporting characters and making more of the previous attempts on Hitlers life would have helped. (Where did Ken Branagh disappear to?) There was a lot more discussing of plans than actually carrying them out. This film is not MI-4 as the trailer led me to believe. Still... it was nice to learn about a little known piece of history.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 8 2009joFeaturedI think most of you have forgoten this is a movie review pagewe all have our own opinions on the warand most of us didnt live through itthe only thing I have to say about it all is I totally agree with mr vallence (i assume he is an older man as he seems to think like the older generation who lived through it all and actually heard of these things over the ""wireless"")my grand father was over in normandy and my grandma went through the war with three children who all remember it as well as aunts and uncles (one off my grandads brothers married a german girl he met days before the war endedhe was in germany at the time as a soldier who had landed at d-day)so I do know how people from that time feel about these ""heros"".Anyways this is MY thoughts on the FILM.cant stand tom average actorthought he did well in this part but still a little sitff.It started of well and then became slightly boring for awhilewhen they got round to doing the biussiness it picked up again.the support cast were great but as some1 has said already not used anywhere near enoughI was looking forward to seeing kenneth on the big screen againthe plot was true to the reallity and yes I agree with others german language would have been better as in downfall but it would put the majority off(there were only 15 of us there as it was)but they could have at least done ""the accent""this is only my opinion of the film and I AM NOT BARRY NORMANS DAUGHTER just to clarrify things as this film (as all war movies)has stirred up old wounds and opinionsits good to see that people still care about what happened and still have enough rage and opinions to carry on like this as it is 60 years ago but it should not be forgotton or swept under the carpet thats when it will happen againI just wish that we could ""forgive the germans"" as they are only people like us and the majority of the real villians of the war are deadFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 7 2009billFeaturedthe best film i have ever seen ever. Have no clue why some idiots criticise this for accents ect this film is amazing. It made me cry at the end when they were all shot and hung it made me cry. It also has action and i loved this film. Who cares at the accents or actors. Were hardly going to get some old german people to try blow up Adolf Hitler because most Germans would/nt dream of it. This film makes you realise just how brave and selfless some people are in the world. Knowing if you mess this up then you die is so selfless as he only thought of others. They never should have died they should have been praised. One problem with this though. If you kill Hitler you die so why not when you see him you pull out a gun and shoot him till all your bullets go because it wouldve been worth it. Oh well  Stauffenberg was the bravest man ever he if i were him i never would have done it what a brave man. This is simply an amzing film with an amzing cast well done to everyone involved with the making of Valkyrie. 5 stars out of 5 from me.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyFeb 7 2009billFeaturedthe best film i have ever seen ever.

When you are making a film about Nazi Germany I really feel that it should be done in German with subtitles. English speaking actors talking in American amp; English accents simply does not cut it.

I see a lot of idealism in some of the postings. Idealism is one thing and reality very often quite different. Idealism says to protest what is wrong. Reality is you get fired youre sprayed with tear gas or water cannon youre shot dead at Kent State you and your family are sent to the Gulag (if youre not all shot). Reality is all that and smaller things that may hurt even more (believe it or not) like your friends/coworkers suddenly not saying ""good morning"" ""how ya doin"" ""Manchester really got trashed on Sunday"" or just looking the other way when you near them. Idealism may rule the mind but survival rules the body. In any court of law the threat to society is what must ultimately be decided upon. The threat of an adult performing the same act whether its carjacking armed robbery rape driving drunk systemic or spur-of-the-moment murder or even littering is higher than the threat of a child repeating it. Adults have had years in which to practice these acts. Very many of them live a lifestyle that demands they act in a certain manner and so they do. The real threat to society is not the performer of the act but the idea of the act being a sane way to live. For instance I lose control of my vehicle hit a light pole and knock it down. It is immaterial whether I lose control because of black ice on the road or a child darts out onto the road or Im talking on my phone. I have performed the act of hitting the pole. Of course the idea that hitting light poles with my car is something to do every day or every now and then is patently insane. The rabid Nazi is one of these people. Addicted to the glitz and glamour of absolute power they were as helpless as any using crack addict. Those ones were insane. Do you honestly think that todays courts would not send someone for psychiatric evaluation if they dressed up like a Nazi goose-stepping though town shooting and yelling that Jews and Gypsies were the cause of all our problems? Of course they would. Food for thought Is the real rabid Nazi any less insane than the fake rabid Nazi that I just described? I dont think so. The greatest impact the Allies had on ensuring Nazism would not rear its ugly head again was to rebuild Germany after the war. Churchill was right about 10 million things but he was very much wrong in wanting to turn Germany into an agricultural nation. We all know where feudalism got us. I could facetiously say that Nazism is Feudalism in black leather. How does all this fit in this forum regarding the film Valkyrie? We have crack addicts in our individual national societies today but they are not the sum of all Britons or of all Americans or of all Canadians. Neither were the rabid Nazis the sum of all Germans. One of the many difference between us is that Nazi Germany was (news flash) run by rabid Nazis. Can you imagine our nation being run by crack addicts? The details would be different but the substance would be the same (no pun intended). Whether you have a thick head or not try to understand the idea - Not all (fill-in-the-blank) are bad.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor January 2 2009 Save for later Saved Valkyrie Tom Cruise plays a rebel German officer trying to assassinate Hitler. Paramount pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The long-delayed release of the much-troubled ""Valkyrie"" starring Tom Cruise as the man who would off Hitler promised a stinker of epic proportions. Sadly it lacks the classic awfulness that might have lifted it into the pantheon of Truly Bad Movies. Instead what we have here is a garden variety bad movie of which there have been all too many lately.To begin with Can anybody buy Cruise as someone named Col. Claus von Stauffenberg? His full name - inhale deeply - was Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. He was the German aristocrat who fed up with the Fuhrer - though not apparently with the Reich - engineered a cadre of rebel German officers in 1944 to assassinate Hitler and take control of Berlin using Hitlers own national emergency reserve army.Since we already know how this is going to turn out the success of the film depends heavily on the engineering of director Bryan Singer and screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander. It depends most of all on Cruise who not only stars but also put together the project under the banner of his company United Artists. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Since von Stauffenberg is badly injured in Tunisia at the start of the film - losing his right arm two fingers of his left hand and his left eye - Cruise is suitably outfitted with a prosthetic arm and black eye patch that afford him ample chances to ham it up. On the other hand he doesnt trouble to affect a German accent or even a British one. He sounds like a clean-cut American dude. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Valkyrie This is a bit jarring since the cast is rounded out by a gaggle of Brits playing Germans with British accents. I realize this is an old theatrical convention and probably things would sound a lot worse if everyone was trying to sound like Werner Klemperer. Still the realism of the enterprise is consistently undercut by the duelling US versus. English intonations (which at times seems to be what the war is really all about). One by one von Stauffenbergs enablers parade before us as enacted by Bill Nighy Terence Stamp Tom Wilkinson Eddie Izzard and Kenneth Branagh (as Maj.-Gen. Henning von Tresckow who tries to kill the Fuhrer with some booby-trapped French liqueur. What no schnapps?). Hitler on the skids and played with suitably creepy understatement by David Bamber does without the Britishisms. Such are the privileges of the damned.The uniforms in this movie are a lot crisper than the storytelling which doesnt really crank into high gear until near the end. But theres something disreputable about turning such a complex true story into essentially just another routine World War II action picture. Singer doesnt really engage the ambiguities of his material. For example how could one be against Hitler while at the same time be a champion of the Reich? Would von Stauffenbergs assassination attempt have occurred if the Germans at that time were winning? We never hear of the conviction among some of the plotters that by killing Hitler they would align Germany with the Allies against the Soviets.Im not saying ""Valkyrie"" should have been suitable for the History Channel. But surely there is some middle ground between a history lesson and mindless action-adventure. The people who made ""Valkyrie"" not only didnt find that ground; they werent even looking for it. They were too busy rummaging through old uniforms and old movies. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for violence and brief strong language.)

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Christmas Week Movies 2008 Seven films to while away the holiday from Brad Pitts Benjamin Button to Tom Cruises Valkyrie Share Tweet Prev 7 of 7 Next View All At the Movies Valkyrie By Richard SchickelWednesday Dec. 24 2008 Frank Connor / United Artists Common sense tells us -- or ought to tell us -- not to believe the pre-release gossip that accretes around expensive commercially chancy movies starring actors who have found themselves on the tabloid hit lists. Case in point Valkyrie. It is the true story of the June 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler which is largely unknown to todays popular audience and which involves a lot of high-ranking German officers standing around in their smart uniforms discussing their plans. In recent years the only movies about World War II that seem to gain any traction with moviegoers involve the Holocaust which is morally fine but which also greatly limits our understanding of the vastest and most desperate megadrama of the twentieth century. The other apparent problem with the film is that it stars Tom Cruise whose sudden fall from favor can be dated from the moment he chose to hop up and down on Oprahs couch in a manner judged to be unseemly by the junk press whose own seemliness is as I understand it always beyond reproach. All of this however reckons without the suspenseful polish of the actual film directed by Bryan Singer he of The Usual Suspects and Superman Returns. Im not going to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie. But in its way it is a thoughtful and entertaining one especially in comparison with the pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season. And that says nothing of the measured passion and intelligence Cruise brings to his portrayal of Claus von Stauffenberg the lead conspirator in the plot to place a bomb in close proximity to the Fuhrer at a staff meeting at Wolfs Lair his closely guarded semisecret headquarters in East Prussia. Stauffenberg is not a natural fit for Cruise even though the actors range and expertise have been consistently underrated probably because most critics cant see beyond his extraordinary good looks. Here he is called upon to play the scion of one of Germans oldest aristocratic families a devout Roman Catholic and a brave stiff-backed solider who served on virtually every front during the war and lost an arm and an eye in North Africa yet continued his career as a staff officer. What turned him against the Nazis was not genocide -- the Holocaust is not mentioned in this film -- but the brutality he witnessed at the front particularly as practiced by SS troops in Russia. These depredations he felt dishonored the German military tradition an opinion in which he was not alone. Many Prussian officers (played in the movie by a raft of English actors including Kenneth Branagh Bill Nighy and Terence Stamp) shared it. And so Stauffenberg attempted twice to bomb Hitler. The first try was totally aborted; the second might well have succeeded he managed to arm and place a briefcase containing a bomb at Hitlers feet. But he left the room and another officer moved the briefcase in order to peer more closely at a map. As a result Hitler suffered only a mild wound. By the time Stuaffenberg had flown back to Berlin where he intended to command an insurrection by the citys home guard his role and that of his colleagues was beginning to be exposed. By the end of the day he and others were shot by firing squads his last words being ""Long live our sacred Germany."" Obviously this is a fated story its end known to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of wartime history. But Singer has shot his film in a formal almost elegant style -- it looks and feels like a lot of old wartime movies set in tortured Europe -- and working from a script by Christopher McQuarre and Nathan Alexander he does a very good job of maintaining suspense mainly by concentrating on details in particular the psychologies of all the conspirators. Theres a degree of reluctance in some of them and a degree of incompetence too but they exhibit a heartening bravery and dutifulness. Somehow against the odds we are drawn to them. Cruise does not quite look his part and I would guess the historic Stauffenberg carried himself with more aristocratic stiffness than he chooses to display. That said he provides what any movie of this kind requires -- someone to root for. I suppose its possible that the younger movie audience will regard Valkyrie as an irrelevancy too distant in time place and attitudes to attract their attention. But setting demographic prejudice aside it is a well-made film that raises timeless questions about the demands of military duty when they are placed in conflict with higher principles. Have we not in recent years seen American soldiers wrestling -- in less melodramatic form -- with that issue?

Claus von Stauffenberg in ""Valkyrie"" rings hollow.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post On July 20 1944 an attempt was made on Adolf Hitlers life at his headquarters on the Eastern Front. It was the second try (another fell apart the prior spring) by a group of German officers part of the Resistance movement that had taken root in the early 1940s. In the chaos the assassination looked as if it had been successful. The chief perpetrator reported seeing a body draped with Hitlers coat as he and his aide made their getaway. Alas the Fuhrer did not die at Wolfs Lair that day but in a bunker less than a year later having committed suicide. Bryan Singer the director of ""Valkyrie"" knew the challenge inherent in his project how to create a thriller in which the outcome is so well known? ""Valkyrie"" proves that knowing theres a hurdle ahead doesnt guarantee clearing it. They have delivered a big (i.e. expensive) period piece with muted effect about a grand scheme that didnt achieve its aim. Maybe theres an irony in that but ""Valkyrie"" leaves audiences with ""what if"" scenarios. What if this lesser-known chapter of German resistance had been more deeply captured? What if the moral conflicts running through this movie about love of country and revolt said more about Germany war and yes genocide? Tom Cruise plays Col. Claus von Stauffenberg a Bavarian aristocrat whose military career was forged in the wake of the Treaty of Versailles. A German voice-over and English subtitles give way to Stauffenberg ruminating in English on the national disaster Hitler has become for Germany. At the time 1943 Stauffenberg is stationed in Tunisia where he loses an eye his right hand and fingers on his left. Cruises character wears an eye patch occasionally switching to a glass eye. Well-regarded Stauffenberg was made chief of staff in the General Army Staff in Berlin. In early July 1944 he was made chief of the General Staff of the Reserve Army. Operation Valkyrie was the name Hitler gave a plan for reinstating Nazi control of the government should an attempt on his life prove successful. It was also the code name Stauffenberg and others gave their plan of action. The coup detat would piggyback onto Hitlers Operation Valkyrie. Cruise detractors will blame the movies flatness on the star. Because his company United Artists is releasing the film they are partially right. But the problem belongs chiefly to the screenplay. Cruise gives his finest turns portraying characters whose likability is complicated by circumstance and their own flaws. ""Collateral"" ""Magnolia"" and even ""Jerry Maguire"" come readily to mind. A German national who served during the Third Reichs rise before having a change of conscience would seem in keeping for gray characters. But writers Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander dont brave the contradictions. Their Stauffenberg who is more cipher than man forces Cruise into an earnest performance. Hes all sense of urgency but it rings hallow. Others in the impressive cast including Tom Wilkinson Kenneth Branagh and Bill Nighy (as Gen. Friedrich Olbricht) fare only marginally better. Terence Stamp delivers a nicely contained Ludwig Beck who was to become head of the new government. Wilkinson is adept at serving up a mix of smarm and calculation as Stauffenbergs commander in Berlin Gen. Friedrich Fromm. A key player in the plots to kill Hitler was Maj. Gen. Henning von Tresckow. Yet he gets short shrift and Branagh seems wasted. The final act takes place in the Benderblock where Stauffenberg has returned. (Since 1980 the building has housed the Memorial to the German Resistance.) Scenes unfold in that period of high confusion. Was Hitler dead? Could Valkyrie be launched? Like so much that has come before these moments strain to make a climax out of events that should have already claimed if not our minds at least our hearts.

Comments Valkyrie Rated PG-13  120 minutes Every good caper movie offers an assortment of vividly rendered conspirators a requirement unfulfilled by the German postage stamps who populate this World War II adventure. Tom Cruise stars as Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg the Nazi officer who led a plot to assassinate Hitler in July 1944; the movies long-delayed release and the idea of Cruise stomping around in jackboots and an eyepatch have invited endless ridicule but at least hes fully invested in the project which is more than one can say for the mercenary Brits propping him up (Kenneth Branagh Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson Terence Stamp). As a suspense movie this works pretty well director Bryan Singer (X-Men The Usual Suspects) maintains a crisp pace as the plotters set out to kill the fuhrer with a briefcase bomb and the historical details of the botched coup which exploited one of Hitlers own contingency plans to mobilize the army reserves and disarm the SS are inherently interesting.

In this image released by MGM Tom Cruise portrays Claus von Stauffenberg left and Carice Van Houten portrays his wife Nina in ""Valkyrie."" Photo AP/MGM Frank Connor. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald Tom Cruise is not the only reason Bryan Singers ambitious film about a real-life plot to murder Adolf Hitler doesnt live up to expectations. But the fact that the exceptionally American Cruise is never believable as German officer Claus von Stauffenberg remains the most difficult issue for the movie to overcome. And that eye patch -- historically accurate or not -- only makes matters worse. The real Stauffenberg was a Roman Catholic aristocrat who grew increasingly disillusioned with the war and plotted to destroy the Nazi Party with a large cabal of other high-ranking officers. (The movie makes it seem as though you couldnt walk two goose steps across the Fatherland without running into an officer eager to commit high treason which has the unfortunate effect of lessening the suspense.) The big cast is also part of the problem. The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander introduces a seemingly endless series of characters but theres no time to flesh any of them out enough to make you worry about their fate. Instead the talky script spends its time detailing the complicated plot to kill Hitler which Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators hope will culminate when a suitcase bomb goes off in the Fuhrers private bunker. Even the worst history student knows there was no successful attempt on Hitlers life (though there were quite a few of them). Still knowing a storys end at the beginning doesnt prevent a filmmaker from eking out narrative tension. We all know the Titanic sank like a stone and James Cameron had us biting our nails anyway. But in Valkyrie we get a steady recitation of whats going to happen next. The film improves once the assassination attempt goes awry but the audience is never truly invested in the actions of these heroic men.

No I said we didnt know the Fatherland was up in arms but if I may say Its probably not a good idea for the German people in this particular instance to get all exercised over someones religion. Im just sayin. Anyway Valkyrie is a two-hour monument to the self-sacrifice of German soldiers under the Third Reich. Doesnt casting Tom Cruise ensure its message will be heard around the worldespecially in countries that hate Nazis more than Scientologists? Germany should be delighted. Even if they can count the number of actual Germans in the film on one hand havent movie Nazis been a lovely reparation for the Battle of Britain? The number of U.K. actors employed every year (especially here with Nazis galore) is a gift that keeps on giving to the British theater. The movie itself is nowhere near as embarrassing as early reports suggested. Directed by Bryan Singer in a break from his gayish superhero movies its a low-key procedural with a dollop of suspensealthough perhaps not enough to make up for the foregone conclusion. After an ill-advised prologue in which Cruise speaks the actual language (much mirth among the German TV folks) the star reverts to his standard middle-American tones; he looks stalwart and unfussy in his crisp uniform with his cute little eye patch. The Brits who scurry around himBill Nighy Tom Wilkinson Eddie Izzard Kenneth Branagh Terence Stampnever convince us they wouldnt rather have a pint of bitter over a stein of helles and some wurst but they go through the Heil Hitler motions with stiff upper lips. Valkyrie doesnt whip you up like that Jewish vigilante avenger picture Defiance but in this season of throat-grabbing Holocaust movies its gentlemanliness is most welcome. -- David Edelstein Related Stories Featured In Great Moments in Eye Patches (1/5/09) Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick Kanye West Wants Apple to Hurry Up and Buy Tidal Already 6 Things We Learned About HBOas New Series Insecure Teen Wolfs Tyler Posey Apologizes For His Fake Coming Out TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.

By Anthony Lane Share Tweet Table of Contents Tom Cruise as Claus von Stauffenberg a colonel who tried to assassinate Hitler. Credit Illustration by Tom Bachtell Of the many historical questions raised by ""Valkyrie"" the most pressing is this if General Erich Fellgiebel the head of the German Army Signal Corps really had looked and behaved like Eddie Izzard just how grave a threat would the Nazis have presented to world peace? In Bryan Singers new film Izzard clearly enjoying every stride in his polished knee-high boots does indeed play the officer in question who oversaw communications going into and out of the Wolfsschanze or Wolfs Lair the Fuhrers woodland redoubt. It was in his Lair that the Wolf came closest to being savaged by his own pack. There had been schemes against Adolf Hitler before but it was not until the Stauffenberg plot that the motive the means and the opportunity cohered. The only thing missing was luck. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg by then the chief of staff of the Reserve Army was good-looking high-born much decorated and bereft of one hand and one eye lost in action in North Africa. In short he was a warring Teuton straight out of central casting complete with piratical eye patch and that is why central casting was right to go directly to Tom Cruise. He carries the movie although once you dig beneath the uniform there isnt much for him to get a handle on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did not in who he was. Singer and his screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie last worked together on ""The Usual Suspects"" and there are passages here that recall the suavity of the earlier film (which remains Singers best). The plan is for Stauffenberg to carry a briefcase bomb into the fortified bunker where he will be meeting Hitler and then to sidle out before it blows. At the last minute the heat of the day--July 20 1944--causes a move to a flimsier hut and in one brilliant travelling shot we see Cruises eyes flick sideways to the huts open windows which can only weaken the blast. Then in a cloakroom as he struggles to plug the fuses into the explosive his single hand betrays him and the briefcase threatens to slide from his grasp the intimate semi-comic desperation of this is exquisitely painful to watch and were it allied to a larger sense of the labyrinthine as it was in ""The Usual Suspects"" the whole movie would coil neatly into a ball of suspense. Instead of which it unravels. The problem is not that we know the outcome. (The bomb went off but the Fuhrers injuries were light.) We know that de Gaulle likewise never fell to an assassin but that didnt stop ""The Day of the Jackal"" from getting under your skin. The problem is the buildup. Valkyrie was the name of a plan which Hitler himself approved to mobilize the military reserve in the event of a coup. The plotters tried to use this to their advantage spreading rumors of an S.S. coup immediately after the bombing and thus duping the Army into supporting their cause; how they expected to reveal the bluff and still enjoy the Armys support is anyones guess. (Thats what you get when aristocrats with a conscience run the show. Valkyrie didnt lack courage or commitment. It lacked N.C.O.s.) Singer does his best to unpick this tangle but it remains highly confusing and he is not helped by his decision to recruit an entire battalion of veteran British performers. Character acting is of course one of the four things that the British still do supremely well the others being soldiering tailoring and getting drunk in public but you can have too much of a good thing and there were points in ""Valkyrie"" when I felt that I was watching a slightly outre installment of the Harry Potter series. General Friedrich Olbricht was one of the prime movers in the conspiracy but Bill Nighy playing him in clear-rimmed spectacles is his usual self--funny quivering and borderline fey. I found it hard to picture him receiving the Iron Cross. And how about Terence Stamp as General Beck? Or the ever-perplexed Tom Wilkinson as General Friedrich Fromm a human hog? These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis. No wonder Eddie Izzard feels at home. The one exception is David Bamber who assumes the role of the Fuhrer and delivers not a rant but a low-toned portrait of a paranoiac his gaze pre-shadowed with suspicion; its as though he were waiting for the bomb already priming himself for revenge. When it came it was vicious some two hundred people were executed. Stauffenberg set the noblest of moral examples but what makes ""Valkyrie"" more depressing than exciting is that it forces you to ask against your judgment what exactly he achieved. Nobody watching the start of ""Waltz with Bashir"" a new animated film from Israel could foresee the subtlety to come. The opening scene snaps the audience awake but it doesnt go easy on the symbolism. A pack of dogs--twenty-six in all--with jaws and eyeballs of a murderous gold pound along a city street. Which particular aggressor we wonder do they stand for? Heres the first twist they dont. They come from a nightmare suffered by a man named Boaz who in 1982 was serving in the Israeli Army. One night his unit approached a village that was harboring Palestinian militants; the local hounds acted as an early-warning system so it was Boazs job to shoot them with a silenced rifle. Guess how many he killed. We know this because Boaz--a real guy not a fictional character--tells the story. He tells it to Ari Folman the director of ""Waltz with Bashir"" who has made a movie so unusual that it overflows any box in which you try to contain it. Call it an adult psycho-documentary combat cartoon and youre halfway there. Folman himself appears throughout the story lightly stylized for the sake of graphic simplicity. He listens over a drink to Boazs recollections but regrets that he cant help. ""Im just a filmmaker"" he says. ""Films can be therapeutic"" Boaz replies. What I liked about ""Waltz with Bashir"" is that it confronts so much and whatever Boaz says resolves so little. You come out feeling more troubled in mind than when you went in and with considerable scarring to your minds eye. As a nineteen-year-old Folman himself was part of the Israeli Defense Forces that went into Lebanon. He is triggered by Boazs memories into realizing to his consternation that he has none of his own. He was present he knows at the notorious occasion in September 1982 on which Christian Phalangists entered the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps in West Beirut (whose entry points were controlled by the I.D.F.) and carried out a massacre of the civilians inside but nothing of that time has until now stayed in his head. This makes sense the worse the trauma and the guilt the deeper it lurks under the volcano and only when Ari meets up with Boaz does the lava begin to flow. He is soon visited by his own dream--an ominous vision of himself and his comrades rising naked from the sea off the coast of Beirut. This is one of many fluid images that stream through the film ranging from spits of rain on a car window to a giant woman who backstrokes in the ocean cradling another friend of Aris on her bosom. These harrowed men seem to believe that they were born out of amniotic peace into a new horror where the dominant liquid was blood. You could argue that the film has no business forging such beauty out of savage facts. What comfort is it to the relatives of the Sabra and Shatila victims you might ask that a few conscripts who stood by and did nothing are now free to articulate and even to lyricize their internal pain? My suspicion is that Folman is all too aware of that charge. That is why whatever the rapture that laps at his work its basic rhythm is hard and halting. (Much of the dialogue is pure questioning ""Shooting? At who?"" ""How do I know?"") Ari goes from one old colleague to the next probing them for what actually occurred on those September nights. We learn of the single foe with a grenade launcher who took on Israelis in an orchard and turned out to be a kid; of the soldier who doused himself in patchouli so that his fellows could trace him in the dark; and of another Ori who kept the worst violence at bay by telling himself that he was simply watching a movie. At the end of ""Waltz with Bashir"" we suddenly switch to normal film genuine news footage from the refugee camps. The screen is filled with the dead including a child. I know what Folman wants to do here but it strikes me as a mistake. He has already admitted via Oris tale that a camera can both present us with suffering and shield us from it (that is the paradox of TV) and what is more we have spent the past ninety minutes coming to terms with the style and the conviction of his filmmaking. His chosen idiom with its jagged lines and its unforgettable coloring--sick yellows and bruised browns like a black eye--has proved more than adequate to the summoning of things that he like some of his countrymen had fought to forget. Why scorn it now? When reality bites is that the time for the artist to lay down his brush?  Share Tweet Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Paramount Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Dec. 25 2008 1159 p.m. ET If time flowed backward for me as it does for Brad Pitt in ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" I would have been almost three hours younger by the time the end credits rolled around. No such luck on that score but David Finchers majestic fantasy left me happier than I could have imagined Id be. Eric Roths screenplay inspired by a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald turns on a single device. A baby is born old -- not just old but downright senescent -- and youthens as he grows. Yet the film which co-stars Cate Blanchett quickly outgrows any sense of gimmickry and matures into a one-of-a-kind meditation on mortality times inexorable passage and the fleeting sweetness of love. Watch a scene from the film ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" starring Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett. Video courtesy of Paramount Pictures. Time is of the essence in more ways than one. The production takes its time and uses it wisely in tracking Benjamins development from an ugly incubus through a teenage codger to a middle-aged 26-year-old whos certainly spry but still too old for Ms. Blanchetts Daisy. She is Bens contemporary a friend from their New Orleans childhood whos become an impossibly ravishing ballet dancer. Not until he grows 15 years younger and she grows 15 years older however are they right for each other physically as well as spiritually. ""My God"" Daisy says at one point in their mid-40s ""look at you -- youre perfect."" Its a charming laugh line since he has finally emerged as a fully recognizable Brad Pitt. And what a remarkable presence the actor is not just during that golden era but before and after when he has only his voice and eyes with which to fashion Bens character while the wonders of digital technology and age-confounding makeup provide his body and face. Its a great performance by any measure but let me count some of the other ways that Mr. Finchers film is remarkable. Ms. Blanchetts performance to be sure; shes breathtaking in a long red dress dancing in a fog-shrouded gazebo; otherwise shes simply dazzling and deeply affecting. A supporting cast that includes Tilda Swinton Taraji P. Henson Jason Flemyng and Jared Harris. Alexandre Desplats score as exquisite and evocative as the Scott Joplin concert waltz woven through it. Claudio Mirandas sumptuous cinematography Donald Graham Burts art direction and production design and Jacqueline Wests costumes. ""Benjamin Button"" is all of a visionary piece and its a soul-filling vision. Waltz With Bashir Ari Folmans ""Waltz With Bashir"" is an absolute stunner a feature-length animated documentary from Israel in which the force of moving drawings amplifies eerily powerful accounts of war shaky remembrance and rock-solid repression. See a clip from the film ""Waltz With Bashir."" Video courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics. The film begins with the riveting image of vicious orange-eyed dogs coursing through the blue-black streets of nighttime Tel Aviv. By the time its over those dogs denizens of one ex-soldiers recurrent nightmare have been connected to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and to Israels indirect responsibility for a Christian militias massacre of Palestinian refugees. Connections were what Mr. Folman was after. A veteran of that war he made the film as an experiment in self-therapy after realizing how little he recalled of an experience that should have been as unforgettable as it was terrible. At bottom ""Waltz With Bashir"" -- the title relates to the battle rapture of an Israeli soldier in Beirut -- is a conventional documentary in which the filmmaker tries to elicit information from real-life countrymen who went to war with him. Yet it breaks with convention in two ways. The more obvious one is stylistic -- the testimony we hear often flattened and matter-of-fact is heightened by the sensational sometimes surreal animation. The other break is substantive and shocking. If connections were the goal disconnections are the discovery. Mr. Folmans witnesses dont remember their time in Lebanon any more reliably than he does so his self-therapy proves a failure. But his signal success lies in charting the human minds gift for keeping bad memories at bay. War is hell as everyone claims to know but heres a baleful new perspective on the subject. Wars are fought the film tells us then literally forgotten. Valkyrie Two dramatic arcs intersect in ""Valkyrie"" a big old-fashioned action adventure starring Tom Cruise as Claus von Stauffenberg the aristocratic German army colonel who in 1944 led the July 20 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler. In addition to the plot itself theres the arc of Mr. Cruises career from ""Risky Business"" to the riskier business of embodying an authentic German hero in a lavish English-language production with limited suspense; the audience -- at least some of it -- knows that the plot failed. So how does the film work? Well enough in the end. Mr. Cruises performance turns out to be brisk and reasonably plausible though unexceptional while the production as a whole succeeds as an elaborate procedural impressively staged in historical locations. See a clip from the film ""Valkyrie."" Video courtesy of United Artists. The director was Bryan Singer best known for ""The Usual Suspects""; he worked from a script by his writer on that film Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander. Newton Thomas Sigel did the stunning cinematography and Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb collaborated on the splendid production design. Mr. Singer comes as close as anyone could to sustaining the illusion of action when nothing is happening and nothing much happens for quite a while apart from the hatching of Stauffenbergs plot and the exchange of meaningful glances. (My favorite moment of throbbing inertia comes when someone says hes going to lunch and the announcement is met by a tympani roll.) Once the plotters plunge into action though ""Valkyrie"" becomes both an exciting thriller and a useful history lesson. Younger members of the audience may not have known that the Nazi armys officer corps contained nests of determined resistance to Hitlers madness. Revolutionary Road ""Revolutionary Road"" was adapted from Richard Yatess highly regarded novel about stifling conformity in 1950s suburbia. The movie is stifling all right and depressing in the bargain. The road of the title is the address of April and Frank Wheeler the couple played by Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio; its also the figurative road that April wants them to follow an escape route from suburban life to the freedom of expatriate life in Paris. The best scene is the opening one when April and Frank first meet at a Manhattan party and he cheerfully admits that he has no idea what he wants to do with his life. In fact Frank is a black hole that sucks up whatever energy the movie musters. (Ms. Winslet has several powerful scenes and Zoe Kazan finds variety and spontaneity in the minor role of Franks sexual playmate at the office.) The pompous direction was inflicted by Sam Mendes who seems to regard the 1950s as a foreign country. Last Chance Harvey ""Last Chance Harvey"" is a good chance to see two superb actors having their way with wafer-thin material. Dustin Hoffmans Harvey and Emma Thompsons Kate meet by chance in London. Chance in this case means the laborious workings of an anti-surprise script; in scene after scene the outcome is clear from the start. The title also refers to Harveys plight. Long divorced and newly jobless he has flown in from New York for the wedding of his almost-estranged daughter and sees Kate as his last shot at a happy life. See a clip from ""Last Chance Harvey."" For a while Joel Hopkinss romantic comedy is little more than bright banter and naked contrivance. Parallel passages follow the equally lonely Harvey and Kate (she works in customer relations at Heathrow airport) as they dont meet again then almost do then do. But the film catches fire when Harvey brings Kate to the wedding reception. Thats where Mr. Hoffman seizes a good moment that the script has given him and turns it into a speech thats worth the price of admission. Suddenly the actors art transforms contrivance into the defining moment of a mans life. Marley amp; Me The Marley of ""Marley amp; Me"" is by his owners account the worlds worst dog. This is far from the worlds worst dog movie -- youd have to be made of granite to resist all the charms of a free-spirited 100-pound Lab. Yet the production manages against heavy odds to make its canine star an incorrigible bore. The problem is bad parenting. Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston are John and Jenny Grogan a husband and wife who supposedly learn life lessons from Marley as their family grows through the years. What lessons though? They never seem to grasp the concept that dogs must be trained. Find related TV listings at LocateTV. Bedtime Stories Disneys ""Bedtime Stories"" looks cute in the trailers thanks to a bug-eyed computer-generated guinea pig named Bugsy. Be forewarned though. Bugsy is only a shill for a particularly crude and disjointed Adam Sandler comedy. If you listen carefully to the strains of ""When You Wish Upon a Star"" during the Disney corporate intro you may hear Walt moaning in his grave. See a clip from ""Bedtime Stories."" Mr. Sandler is no stranger to crudity; its intrinsic to his slob esthetic. ""Im like the stink on your feet"" he says in this one ""Ill always be around."" Hes Skeeter Bronson a hotel handyman who tells his niece and nephew bedtime stories that have a magical way of coming true. (Theyre garishly overproduced stories that mimic ""Star Wars"" assorted Westerns and ""Spartacus."") Still the crudity here isnt confined to a few fart jokes. As a PG-rated film opening on Christmas Day under the Disney banner ""Bedtime Stories"" would seem to promise fairly wholesome family entertainment. What it delivers is the glitzy allure of a hotel setting smarmy double entendres Ferrari lust Beverly Hills bling and pneumatic babes -- one of the characters is a surrogate Paris Hilton. The real bug-eyed guinea pigs will be the little kids in the audience.

Whos Blogging >> Links to this article By Philip Kennicott Washington Post Staff Writer Thursday December 25 2008; Page Expectations for ""Valkyrie"" Tom Cruises history-based thriller about the July 20 1944 attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler were low. The subject matter couldnt be more serious and Cruises career hasnt exactly been a steadily accumulation of gravitas. Gone but not forgotten are the days of Oprah couch-jumping and Matt Lauer tongue-lashing. And his professed faith in Scientology makes him a lightning rod especially in Germany where ""Valkyrie"" was filmed and is the subject of considerable controversy. Worst of all though was damning criticism from Berthold Schenk von Stauffenberg son of the films hero Claus von Stauffenberg who told Cruise to keep his grubby Hollywood mitts off dear old dad -- and go home. This StoryValkyrieHoliday Movie GuideHollywoods Losing Battle Creating a Nicer Nazi Cruise did neither. Against all expectations -- and much to the relief of MGM where Cruise is now a boss of United Artists -- he has fashioned a successful if not exceptional film. Directed by Bryan Singer ""Valkyrie"" is a brutally efficient bit of storytelling and it makes no unforced errors. Visually it is tightly controlled to the point of claustrophobia a grim study in battleship gray and the dreary palette of fascism. It is admirably free of any Spielbergian effort to squeeze sentimentality or inspirational lessons out of what is a complicated and morally complex story. With fine performances from Kenneth Branagh Bill Nighy and Terrence Stamp it is a well-cast ensemble piece. And even Cruise whom many doubted could carry off the aristocratic elan of the blue-blooded von Stauffenberg manages his part respectably with a combination of ramrod posture starched costumes and minimalist acting. So why isnt it possible to be more enthusiastic about this film? Why does it feel as if something sinister is lurking beneath its polished surface? Screenwriters Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander seem to have followed the account of the plot as laid out in William Shirers ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" with only minimal changes and some understandable condensation. Von Stauffenberg a fast-rising golden boy of the German army is introduced at the moment he is wounded in North Africa. He overcomes the loss of an arm two fingers and one eye and continues his ascent in military circles. But his disillusionment with Hitler and Hitlers disastrous two-front war leads him to join -- and quickly take leadership of -- one of the more determined circles of anti-Hitler conspirators. The history is mostly accurate but not complete. And that is part of the problem. The most disturbing loss is any sense of von Stauffenbergs life before the movie opens. He was the hero of the assassination plot but he was not a committed anti-Nazi until very late in the game. Many anti-Hitler conspirators werent so much against Nazism with its vile racial and militarist policies as they were against Hitlers disastrous leadership of the war. Von Stauffenberg was not only untroubled by Hitlers nationalism and early aggression he helped further it as a loyal soldier. It was only later when he learned more about the master he served with military punctiliousness that he saw the light. Most of that is left out of the film. As is any clear sense of how late in the war the plot came. Although there is a scene early in the film in which von Stauffenbergs family takes refuge in an air-raid shelter theres little evidence of the pragmatic (and self-serving) motivation of many of the conspirators. Germany was in danger of imminent collapse and they hoped to avoid the humiliation of invasion and occupation. Even more problematic than the loss of historical context is the weird lack of humanity in the film. Machines rule in this tremendously mechanistic film. Planes cars telephones teletypes ticker tapes and guns create a weird cacophony of mechanical sounds. Voices sometimes even at critical moments of dialogue are sometimes inaudible against the howling background of machine-generated noise. Like the machines it focuses on so intently the film is rigorous and relentless with very little human in it. Two tears trickle down two checks which is about the sum total of emotional display other than the usual staples of military life frustration anger determination courage. Whats going on here? On one level the film shows a dark truth of the plot It was a military plot generated within military circles which is to say that it was fueled by many of the same forces that Hitler had harnessed to become FA1/4hrer. Cruises von Stauffenberg is not so much the aristocratic Catholic educated Stauffenberg of German legend; he is rather a German military man of the old school a human machine affectless beyond his passion for the mission. But perhaps theres something else. The name ""Valkyrie"" refers to a set of preexisting plans to use the army to quell rebellion which the plotters tailored and attempted to use for their own ends. It was borrowed from German literature and more immediately from Richard Wagner who used it as the title of one of his operas. And it is in ""Die WalkA1/4re"" that Wotan a god with an eye patch appears. ""Valkyrie"" the movie makes much of von Stauffenbergs missing eye and eye patch. Is there a not-so-subtle reference to Wotan here? Wotan was the last of the old gods and the one whose behind-the-scenes scheming precipitates the downfall of the old order. And so Cruise as von Stauffenberg is a Wotan figure and the film with its almost futurist celebration of man as a mechanical animal celebrates the disciplined determined even-tempered man. A man who is struggling to take down the old order. Its hard to know whether this film is channeling Nietzsche or L. Ron Hubbard. Those who harbor dark fears of Scientology may want to watch the details closely Does the film downplay von Stauffenbergs Christianity or acknowledge it in passing? Does it equate the conspirators with some kind of secret order with cult-like tendencies? Or is all of that entirely too much to read into a Tom Cruise film? ""Valkyrie"" is so austere so strangely inhuman in its depiction of heroism that you cant help but admire it as an entertainment juggernaut and fret about it too for its celebration of a very limited ideal of human behavior. Youd have to believe the worst about Tom Cruise and the makers of ""Valkyrie"" to believe that their film is an allegory for something darker. But then weve grown used to thinking the worst about Tom Cruise even as he rises to the top once again. Valkyrie (120 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence and strong language. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments powered by Web-Wide News Alerts Get MyWebpost Get The Posts take on whatever youre reading -- anywhere on the Web.

In this image released by MGM Tom Cruise portrays Claus von Stauffenberg left and Carice Van Houten portrays his wife Nina in ""Valkyrie."" Photo Frank Connor AP Movie review Valkyrie 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Valkyrie Drama. Starring Tom Cruise Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy. Directed by Bryan Singer. (PG-13. 115 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres nothing inherently laughable about the spectacle of Tom Cruise with an eye patch and a missing hand strutting around in a German colonels uniform. But neither is there anything about him that truly suggests Claus von Stauffenberg leader of the 1944 conspiracy to decapitate the Nazi government and stage a coup detat. Think of ""Valkyrie"" as a reasonably entertaining drama about the time Tom Cruise tried to kill Hitler. Do that and it becomes possible to enjoy the movie. Cruise is an intense actor but the intensity tends to remain the same from performance to performance. The intensity of Ethan Hunt in the ""Mission Impossible"" series is a lot like that of the father who wants his kids to survive in ""War of the Worlds"" or that of the fellow in ""The Last Samurai"" or the futuristic cop in ""Minority Report."" Its the intensity of a man who narrows his eyes grits his teeth and says ""Yes. I can do that."" Its the focus and attack of a man who has never seen an obstacle he could not overcome - maybe because he has never really been up against anything truly monumental. Cruises can-do determination rubs some people the wrong way. Not me. I like it. Its his own thing and it belongs in movies. But importing the Cruise persona into von Stauffenberg makes no sense. Nothing in Cruises performance suggests a handsome aristocrat who has recently had his hand blown off and an eye blown out in battle. Nothing about him suggests Old World weariness the spiritual toll of a protracted war or a hatred for the monsters who have destroyed his country. When Cruise silently assesses the situation and decides yes he will do this he will risk everything for the Fatherland he seems more like an actor contemplating a risky stunt Yes yes I will jump off the bridge wearing an invisible harness with wires attached. And if the insurance people give you any trouble tell them to call my agent at CAA and well see whos running this shoot The history itself is the main appeal here. Von Stauffenberg (Cruise) is brought into the inner circle of senior statesmen and military leaders contemplating some action against Hitler but nothing he hears has even a remote chance of success. Its von Stauffenberg who devises a plan that might work. His great inspiration is to use ""Valkyrie"" - the governments emergency contingent in case of a coup detat - as the actual means of the coup detat. The plan 1) Kill Hitler 2) announce that the SS has killed the Fuhrer and is attempting a coup and 3) use Valkyrie to arrest the entire SS and install a new government. Not a bad plan. ""Valkyrie"" will probably most interest those with a knowledge of the history and yet it might best be experienced by those who have never seen a documentary on the History Channel and have no idea whats going to happen next. Key scenes have a built-in tension and yet for some reason director Bryan Singer seems to rush through the actual assassination attempt. He could have stretched that for greater impact. Overall ""Valkyrie"" has the aura of a prestige project that never achieves its desired level. Major actors appear not only in supporting roles - Tom Wilkinson as the duplicitous Gen. Fromm and Bill Nighy as the vacillating Gen. Olbricht - but also in featured parts Eddie Izzard Kenneth Branagh and Terence Stamp as conspirators and Thomas Kretschmann as the officer sent to crush them. These actors took these parts believing ""Valkyrie"" was going to amount to something. Really even with Cruise as von Stauffenberg. Isnt faith a beautiful thing? One final word about the accents used here Cruise speaks in his normal American accent which makes sense since Germans speak in their normal German accents. But most of the other actors have English accents and hearing them for a moment one thinks theyre playing English characters. Theyre not. Then theres Kretschmann who is German speaking English with a German accent. Someone (like the director) should have gotten the cast together on this. Its not confusing but its distracting. -- Advisory Violence and scenes of Tom Cruise pretending to put in a glass eye.

Good Films Good Director Vincente AmorimGenre DramaRunning Time 96 min Unrated Nazis Nazis everywhere you look ... must be Oscar season where most of the Nazis will have British accents. Tom Cruise is positively surrounded by Brits in Valkyrie as he plays with a flat American accent Col. Claus von Stauffenberg a high-ranking German officer who masterminded a plot to assassinate Hitler. We meet him a few years earlier though in North Africa in a sequence loaded with explosions and divebombing fighter planes. This sequence is all over the movies trailers because its action in a war movie that otherwise mostly involves people talking urgently into telephones. Directed by Bryan Singer who made the X-Men movies Valkyrie does look good and there is a certain intrigue in watching how von Stauffenbergs plot went wrong -- I dont think Im spoiling anything here; Hitler was not assassinated. But as action movies go Valkyrie is pretty short on action. Thats not true of Defiance the story of the Bielski partisans in the eastern part of what was once Poland now known as Belarus. These Jewish partisans armed themselves and managed to hide more than a thousand Jews for several years in densely wooded territory. Its an inspiring story if one that doesnt need quite as much poetic inspiration as Ed Zwicks movie insists on giving it with dialogue thats too often ornate and parable-inflected. This is not out of keeping with Zwicks other war movies -- Glory and The Last Samurai among them -- but in Defiance it has the effect of pushing a striking true story in the direction of hokey Hollywood ones. Oddly what you miss in both Defiance and Valkyrie despite all the chest-thumping warriors is inner conflict. Both films feature protagonists who arent very interesting because they have not an instant of self-doubt. Theyre saintly fighting evil ... figures in historical pageants not characters in a drama. You want drama go to a dramatist. English playwright C.P. Taylor wrote a play called Good that caused quite a stir with its portrayal of a liberal German professor in the 1930s. Played by Viggo Mortensen in the movie the professor is summoned by a Nazi official and is startled to discover that a novel he wrote years ago -- about a loving husband who helps his terminally ill wife end her suffering -- has found favor with the Third Reich. In soothing tones the chairman of the Nazi Party Censorship Committee praises the books approach to the issue of whether individuals have an absolute right to life and then leads the professor a little further down a dangerous path urging him to write a paper articulating his views. This says the official will ensure that ""humanity"" remains at the center of the partys agenda. The implications in hindsight are obvious to the audience but this is early in the Nazi era -- 1937 -- and the uses to which his paper on euthanasia might be put by the Reich slip by the frightened professor. He agrees to write the paper and -- reluctantly -- to join the Nazi Party. By going along the professor finds himself prospering but each seemingly inconsequential choice he makes gets him in deeper. The plot in Good is more or less a dramatization of the notion that ""the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" The movie Good is pretty schematic in laying out that notion -- betraying its theatrical roots perhaps. Its also a little drawn out. But it demonstrates the surprising power of character flaws in drama. How else to explain that the portrayal of a good man who does nothing in Good should prove more dramatically compelling than the stories in Valkyrie and Defiance of good men who did good?

ABOUT THE MOVIE  (out of four)Stars Tom Cruise Kenneth Branaugh Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson Terence Stamp Eddie Izzard Carice van HoutenDirector Bryan SingerDistributor MGMRating PG-13 for violence and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hoursOpens Thursday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Valkyrie is a World War II thriller without enough thrills. The story based on a real-life attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler starts slowly and then takes off about halfway in. But even during scenes of intense action the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing. One of the most misguided aspects is casting Tom Cruise in the lead role. While the supporting cast includes some of the best European -- mainly British -- actors in strong performances Cruise is unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted Col. Claus von Stauffenberg. With his modern Yank-speak Cruise sounds disturbingly American detracting substantially from a believable portrayal of a German officer. Though the other military brass involved -- played by Tom Wilkinson Kenneth Branaugh Terence Stamp Bill Nighy and Eddie Izzard -- are believable none of the characters are well-developed. Its hard to feel the requisite understanding or compassion for any of the players since we know so little about them. The near-miss assassination plan which involves Stauffenberg transporting a bomb in a suitcase was an ambitious effort by a group of rebel officers. The action becomes more engrossing during the films second half but one expects more depth and nuance given its pedigree. Director Bryan Singer and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie last teamed up on the intriguing multifaceted The Usual Suspects from 1995. With Valkyrie they have taken an inherently intriguing plot and streamlined it into oblivion.

"Valkyrie That plot failed; so does this one | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesValkyrie That plot failed; so does this oneThe bedevilling thing about making movies based on history is engaging an audience that knows exactly how it will end. Which is not to say it cant work. By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterWed. Dec. 24 2008Starring Tom Cruise Kenneth Branagh Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp. Directed by Bryan Singer. 120 minutes. At major theatres. PG The bedevilling thing about making movies based on history is engaging an audience that knows exactly how it will end. Which is not to say it cant work. We knew the boat was going down from the get-go in Titanic yet James Camerons suspenseful romantic epic not only carried us along it broke box office records doing it.The same cant be said for Valkyrie where history tells us the 1944 plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler by a band of German officers will fail.The fault rests partly with the script and a slow awkward initial half-hour the movie never recovers from but more with star Tom Cruise who sinks this historical thriller as surely as an iceberg in the North Atlantic took out the Titanic.Article Continued BelowCruise has mistakenly chosen to convey plot leader Col. Claus von Stauffenbergs military bearing and strength of will with acting so rigid and wooden its painful to watch. The contrast with the German officers played by a superb supporting cast - Kenneth Branagh Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp among them - only makes Cruise look worse. Its like watching a stiff-legged colt try to keep up with a stable of thoroughbreds. After losing an eye hand and several fingers in an air raid in North Africa an already disillusioned von Stauffenberg returns to Germany even more determined to stop Hitlers destruction of Europe and campaign of mass murder. Von Stauffenberg joins a German resistance group that plans to assassinate Hitler and suggests they seize power after his death and install a new chancellor by implementing the Nazi governments own orders to mobilize the reserve army in the event of the Third Reichs collapse - Operation Valkyrie.The early setup tends to drag - even an initial Hitler assassination attempt moves at a dull pace - and its not until the plot to bomb Hitlers Wolfs Lair bunker is well underway that the tension ratchets up and this becomes a decent thriller.What saves Valkyrie itself from bombing is the heavy lifting done by Branagh and the others. Nighys Gen. Friedrich Olbricht is a twitchy weakling given to indecision and awkward smiles. Terence Stamps Gen. Ludwig Beck is the groups patrician counsellor calm and aristocratic helping them deal with conflicts between the need to remove Hitler and the deeply ingrained loyalty oath they swore. And Tom Wilkinson as Gen. Friedrich Fromm is as canny and craven as any army careerist has ever been.Much has been made of the fact that with the exception of Cruise the leading cast all have British accents; only Brit David Bamber adopts a German accent for Hitler whom he plays as a wearily befuddled old-looking man. But the English accents work and dont detract from the historical aspect of the movie; Cruises flat Middle American voice doesnt despite his speaking German in the first few moments of the film.Visually Valkyrie is a stylish film with solid work from director Bryan Singer although his Usual Suspects partner screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie has penned an uneven effort. While some scenes snap with smart dialogue (""The SS will pull you apart like warm bread"" Eddie Izzards Erich Fellgiebel warns) other lines drew laughs at a recent screening. ""Well draw straws for that job"" von Stauffenberg intones when asked who will convince Hitler to sign the changes to the Valkyrie document.Once the assassination attempt begins Valkyrie shifts into high gear with an onslaught of near misses fumbles false information and intrigue often propelled to nerve-jangling intensity with shrieking telephones or clattering teletype machines.Like the coup whose story it tells Valkyrie is a near miss failing to sweep us along for what should have been a dramatic ride.Read more about GermanyThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Deck the halls with scheming Nazis--and withered arthritic babies and seething suburban housewives. Those are the grim bundles waiting under the Hollywood tree this recessional holiday season. Its somehow appropriate to the economic moment that the three big Christmas-week releases-- Valkyrie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Revolutionary Road--are about grand failures of one kind or another. Theres the failed plot to assassinate Hitler in Valkyrie the failure of the human body (even a backward-aging one) to conquer time in Button and the Titanic-sized failure of Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprios marriage in Revolutionary Road. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Advertisement It might be argued that all three movies not only depict failure but enact it. Valkyrie the first film out of United Artists Studios since Tom Cruise became the studios sole head last summer has been something of a cursed production dogged by rumors of reshoots and perpetually changing release dates. Its director Bryan Singer talks big but he has to be anxious about the films reception after the universally shrugged-at Superman Returns (2006). And as Slates Stephen Metcalf suggests in his glorious reading of Tom Cruise-as-market-bubble the notion of the stolidly perky Cruise playing a one-eyed one-handed would-be Hitler assassin is just inherently funny. Given all these obstacles Valkyrie comes off surprisingly well. The first half-hour or so does proffer some unintended chuckles as the script strains unnecessarily to provide its hero Col. Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) with background character and motivation. Motivation?? We dont need to learn about the source of Stauffenbergs war wounds (he loses an eye and a hand in a North African bombing raid) or his love for his wife (Carice van Houten) to understand that he wants to kill Hitler. We get it. On with the Hitler-killing Once Singer dispenses with the introductory pathos and gets to the nuts and bolts of Stauffenbergs plan Valkyrie becomes an admirably modest and compact suspense thriller. Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators in the German army (played by the plummily British likes of Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Terence Stamp) arrange to smuggle an explosive-laden briefcase into a meeting with the chancellor. They also secretly make changes to a succession plan Hitler has had drawn up in the event of his death (occasioning one of the films few intentionally funny lines ""Now all you have to do is get Hitler to sign it""). For a thriller with a thoroughly foreordained outcome Valkyrie does a pretty good job at making the viewers palms sweat. Especially so soon after the tedious pieties of The Reader Im not sure I want more from my Nazi holiday viewing than that. Revolutionary Road(Dreamworks) Sam Mendes adaptation of the 1961 novel by Richard Yates hasnt a hair out of place. Its a textbook example of a well-crafted movie beautifully shot impeccably acted and structured like an elegant three-act play. (You can almost imagine the red velvet curtain descending at the end of each act.) So why does the movie feel as pleasantly deadening as the midcentury Connecticut suburb where it takes place? It certainly isnt Kates or Leos fault. Winslet is as ever divine as the repressed April Wheeler who gave up her dreams of becoming an actress to marry Frank (DiCaprio). And while DiCaprio lacks Winslets emotional reach as an actor hes perfectly cast as the cocky self-deluded Frank who commutes to an office job he hates in order to support their two children. Bored stiff by their emotionally sterile life April suggests they shake things up by moving the whole family to Paris. This prospect briefly rekindles the Wheelers marriage until ... well lets just say the last scene isnt a happy family picnic atop the Eiffel Tower. Advertisement Maybe this movies curious emptiness has to do precisely with the actors appeal their matinee-scale beauty and charisma. Yates novel used implied interior monologue--what Flaubert called ""free indirect style""--to indicate the vast gulf between how April and Frank thought of themselves (as thwarted bohemians) and what they really were (fearful middle-aged suburbanites). Without that layer of built-in irony the Wheelers protestations that theyre too good for the life theyre trapped in seem straightforwardly true and what should be a bleak social satire instead reads as a banal melodrama. When April miserably informs her husband that for all their aspirations ""Were just like everybody else"" the audience reflexively protests ""No youre not Youre Kate and Leo He gave his life for you at the end of Titanicfor Gods sake"" The couples on-screen history is part of what gives the Wheelers their undeniable chemistry (even if most of Frank and Aprils chemistry is used to formulate the vitriol they hurl at one another). But that same history--Leo proclaiming himself ""king of the world"" Kates arms outstretched at the prow--is a part of what keeps us on the outside of the Wheelers story unable to find the small-time schemers in the faces of these larger-than-life stars. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button(Warner Bros.) adapted by David Fincher from an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story is the lengthiest and most ambitious of all the Christmas releases yet its the one I have the least to say about. Two hours and 55 minutes is a long time to sustain a mood of puckish whimsy especially when the frame-story narrator is a dying old woman (Cate Blanchett in age makeup) lying immobilized on a hospital bed. Fincher is a technical magician He can convincingly (digitally?) create the illusion that Benjamin Button (Brad Pitt) is aging in reverse; that he--and we--are caught in the middle of a World War II naval battle; and that Cate Blanchett a 39-year-old mother of three is an airborne teenage ballerina. But Finchers magic cant transform him from the coldly dispassionate misanthropist of Se7en Fight Club and Zodiac into a sentimental humanist and it cant turn Brad Pitt into the kind of actor who can carry a movie like this. Dont get me wrong Pitts great in character roles as a comic grotesque or an unrepentant scoundrel. (See Burn After Reading or for that matter Fight Club.) But as a passive introspective leading man like Benjamin hes just dull. Theres not enough going on behind those deep-blue peepers to justify a Forrest Gump-esque jaunt through 80-plus years of American history (though it is amusing to watch that familiar chiseled Pitt face emerge from layers of excellent age makeup). The melancholy final scenes have Blanchett as Benjamins true love Daisy caring for her once-husband as he gradually regresses to babyhood and she approaches old age. This vision of two lives criss-crossing as they ebb finally achieves a profundity the rest of the movie strains for but it comes about two hours and 25 minutes too late.

"Valkyrie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; valkyrie ) Valkyrie (United States/Germany 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Going into this film I wondered whether the filmmakers would succeed at generating tension out of an event whose outcome is so well-known. Even those with only a rudimentary knowledge of history are aware that Hitler did not die as the result of an assassination attempt; students of World War II know the ins and outs of the July 20 1944 plot that ended with more than 5000 arrests and 200 executions. Yet director Bryan Singer has capably crafted this war thriller in such a way that one occasionally forgets the foregone conclusion and becomes wrapped up in the excitement of the moment. Valkyrie covers a span of roughly 18 months from early 1943 until the fatal final day. The film which is fictionalized but follows the known historical facts reasonably faithfully provides a window into the inner workings of the military resistance - those highly-placed Nazi officers who were seeking Hitlers death or ouster. Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) an up-and-comer despite (or perhaps because of) suffering serious wounds in Africa while with the Tenth Panzer Division is recruited into the resistance by its leader Major General Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) and his compatriot General Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy). Its not a ""tough sell"" for Stauffenberg - he has already decided that the moral thing is to preserve the German race by dispatching the leader. He is introduced to other key members of the resistance including former General Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp) and the would-be Chancellor replacement Carl Goerdeler (Kevin McNally). When Tresckow is sent to the front Stauffenberg is placed in charge of the resistance. The plot to assassinate Hitler is a complex scheme that requires not only detonating a bomb close enough to the Fuhrer to kill him but a means by which the S.S. can be cut off and arrested before taking charge. Stauffenberg believes he has the solution something called ""Operation Valkyrie."" Its an emergency plan for the mobilization of the reserve army that could be used to provide the military backing for a coup. Theres a complication however. The undisputed head of the reserves General Freidrich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) must be convinced to cooperate and he is notoriously unwilling to commit to any course of action that is not clearly in his best interests. Nevertheless with the plan in place actions move toward the first assassination attempt. The film contains its share of high-tension scenes including one in which Stauffenberg persuades Hitler (David Bamber) to sign off on his revised version of Operation Valkyrie; the sequence when the bomb is planted and detonated; and the subsequent ""Battle for Berlin"" where nary a shot is fired. The film marks a fascinating aspect of history that is all-too-often neglected in less thorough explorations of World War Two. It is curious to note however that the most famous casualty of the July 20 assassination attempt Field Marshal Rommel (who was mistakenly implicated and committed suicide as a result) is not mentioned in the movie. The oversight is likely the result of time constraints although it would have shown how far and wide the net was spread to wipe out resistance within the military. Valkyrie despite being a more straightforward thriller is less gripping than Downfall the most recent film in which Hitler had significant screen time. David Bambers physical resemblance to the dictator is effective enough for the few scenes in which he appears but it goes without saying that he doesnt come close to Bruno Ganzs startling portrayal in Downfall. Tom Cruise is solid as Stauffenberg. Maybe its partially the result of the eye patch but the actor is quickly buried in the character which is a feat in Cruises case since he is one of the few working celebrities who almost always seems bigger than the parts he plays. The supporting cast comprised primarily of British actors (Kenneth Branagh Tom Wilkinson Bill Nighy) is as good as one would expect from such a group. And Carice von Houten most recently seen as the protagonist in Black Book - another World War II thriller - is gorgeous as Stauffenbergs wife. (Its worth noting that another Black Book cast member Waldemar Kobus is also in Valkyrie. In the former movie he played a piggish Nazi officer. Here hes a police chief who collaborates with the resistance.) Verisimilitude is always a key element of a World War II movie and Valkyrie goes all out. Many scenes were filmed on location in Berlin and in those instances when a place no longer existed it was meticulously recreated. As a result Singer succeeds in the all-important task of transporting audiences back in time. As movies about the Nazi regime go this one is a strong and successful recreation of one aspect of the war that does not receive much screen time. There may not be many white-knuckle moments in this thriller but its to the filmmakers credit that we are nevertheless engrossed from start to finish even though we know how this will all end up.

""Can I count you in?"" Thats certainly what Tom Cruise is hoping this yuletide for audiences to plunk down their dollars and join the movie star and his (mostly) British friends as they goose-step around with great urgency conspiring to assassinate one intensely paranoid dictator. But the history books have already supplied Valkyries spoiler the 1943-44 plot by this group of German officers and aristocrats to kill Adolf Hitler failed. The Fuhrer did his own self in in 1945 when it became apparent that he had lost the war. And so director Bryan Singer - working from a busy screenplay cowritten by his Usual Suspects collaborator Christopher McQuarrie - is faced with a daunting challenge How to keep the suspense taut the action absorbing when it turns out that Col. Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) and his nervous Nazi gang bungled the coup? Talk about impossible missions. Whats surprising about Valkyrie though after the bad press the release-date changes the turmoil at Cruises boutique studio United Artists and the production flaps in Germany (where Scientology Cruises religion of choice is deemed a cult) is that the film isnt half bad. Its certainly not the unwitting laugh riot that many (me included) expected. Shot in a style that harks back to 40s thrillers (lots of close-ups and askew angles) and featuring serious-minded character work by Kenneth Branagh Eddie Izzard Bill Nighy Terence Stamp and Tom Wilkinson Valkyrie manages to drum up a fair degree of tension. That it ultimately becomes too much to follow - resistance leaders squabbling co-conspirators dropping the ball or losing their nerve missed phone calls smuggled missives last-minute changes of plan - well a diagram with the cast of characters their job descriptions and allegiances would be a handy item for some enterprising soul to sell at the multiplex door. Singer showed an interest in things-Third Reichian with the creepy drama Apt Pupil (a Nazi war criminal in hiding) and his first X-Men (a concentration camp scene). Here he goes all out re-creating Hitlers hideaway in the Bavarian Alps staging bustling comings and goings in Berlin and Munich the cities imposing edifices emblazoned with swastikas. Vintage Luftwaffe planes carry important men and important documents while big Mercedes pick up and disgorge stern-visaged SS higher-ups. The director lets his actors talk in their respective accents the Brits British Cruise in his clipped American Carice van Houten (from Paul Verhoevens World War II thriller Black Book) in Dutch-tinged English. Van Houten plays Nina von Stauffenberg wife of the colonel mother to his children. Its hard to say what she thinks of her husbands plot to topple the Fuhrer and his regime - theres not a lot of quality time between the two. Valkyrie which takes its title from a Hitler emergency plan craftily co-opted by the conspirators begins with the profoundly disillusioned colonel writing in his journal on the sands of Tunisia. It is here in early 43 that von Stauffenberg lost his confidence in his leader - and lost his eye his right hand and several fingers on his left. This makes things tricky when a few months later he is required to trigger bomb mechanisms concealed in liquor bottles or leather briefcases. But thats not the least of his troubles. Keeping track of whos doing what whos not doing what they said theyd do whos doing something else altogether whos aborting this assassination attempt and why are they aborting that one - well whats a noble Nazi going to do?Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Claus von Stauffenberg has filled some fans with dread. Never fear Cruise doesnt embarrass himself nor does his presence distort the story into an exercise in movie star ego. Cruise doesnt attempt a German accent and the sterling acting company around him (including Kenneth Branagh Tom Wilkinson Bill Nighy and Eddie Izzard) meet him more than halfway speaking their lines with a soft mid-Atlantic diction. Cruise is left to do what he does so well acting as the courageous point man in an against-all-odds mission. In the final months of World War II a group of dissident German leaders decided that only by assassinating Hitler and seizing control of the government could they hope to secure a truce with the advancing Allies. Von Stauffenberg a veteran of a catastrophic campaign in North Africa (rendered in a stupendous early battle scene) returns to the Fatherland minus an eye and an arm. Convalescing in Berlin he determines to join the resistance movement kill the Fuhrer and end the Nazi regime. Singer who directed the first two X-Men movies and the most recent ""Superman"" reunites with his ""Usual Suspects"" screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie to create a thriller that sticks scrupulously to the facts. Cruise is the marquee draw but hes not the whole story. While Von Stauffenberg is driven by idealism his co-conspirators have a variety of motives not all pure for wanting Hitler dead. They work at cross-purposes and with shifting alliances while trying to keep their secrets in the midst of secret police and traitors. The film is gorgeously made evoking a Germany when even the rural pine trees seemed to stand at attention row on row. Singer has a masterful touch with composition creating tension simply by the way he places his actors around a room. And even though we know how it turned out the assassination plot remains a gripping tale. Students of history will know what became of most of the plotters but the film gives us plenty of cause to worry about the fate of Von Stauffenbergs wife Nina (""Black Books"" stunning Carice van Houten) pregnant with their fifth child. ""Valkyrie"" is a military thriller of high rank.

Or delighted depending. Whatever the case Valkyrie is a pretty good movie certainly not the train wreck many expected (or in some cases seemed to hope for). Cruise plays Col. Claus von Stauffenberg a German officer in World War II whose disgust at the way the fighting has played out lands him leading troops in Tunisia. Injured in battle losing an eye his right hand and two fingers on his left he soon joins up with others in an attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler. A large number of people are involved - a real-life fact meaning that Cruise while a sort of first among equals isnt involved in a star vehicle here. Its more of an ensemble and given the cast is better for it. Not that Cruise is bad. Hes not - and although he has the lone American accent heard here what would be better a fake German one? An early attempt to kill Hitler (there were several) goes awry. But soon von Stauffenberg along with Maj.-Gen. Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) Gen. Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy) and former Gen. Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp) are plotting again with the tacit approval of fence-sitting Gen. Friedrich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson). Von Stauffenberg hits on the idea of perverting Operation Valkyrie in which the reserve army is to take over Berlin so that the plotters might use it to further control of the country after Hitler is dead. He handles the assassination attempt on Hitler himself. Director Bryan Singer keeps the pace fast and although we know the ultimate outcome its easy to get caught up in the excitement of what-if thinking. Communication lines are cut thanks to Gen. Erich Fellgiebel (Eddie Izzard) so for several hours the group thinks it has succeeded. (The scene in which women working in a military telegraph office learn of Hitlers supposed demise before the lines are cut is outstanding.) Only later will the truth play out. Cruise is capable if bland. Branagh is good as von Tresckow false confidence masking near panic. Best of all is Wilkinson whose Fromm vacillates his loyalty lying wherever its likely to keep him alive the longest. The most telling scenes are set in Hitlers residence. (David Bamber plays der Fhrer.) The body language of the other men is chilling - no one speaks without hesitation terrified of the consequences should they say the wrong thing. History catches up with them of course and with Hitler. Valkyrie is not a great film but it is effective in telling a chapter of that history low expectations notwithstanding.

"Valkyrie stars Tom Cruise Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Valkyrie stars Tom Cruise Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson Michael PhillipsTribune critic Judging by Mark Twains comment about the music of Richard Wagner (""better than it sounds"") if Twain were around to see ""Valkyrie"" hed likely say its better than it seems.Faint praise for an interesting film with an asterisk the asterisk being Tom Cruise. Director Bryan Singers drama about a plot to assassinate Hitler--the one that came closest to succeeding on July 20 1944--scrubs its protagonist clean for the purposes of pop movie salesmanship. Singer made ""The Usual Suspects""; he knows a thing or two about keeping hushed conversations in enclosed rooms nice and tense. Working here from a script by Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander the film focuses on a handful of key German officers who joined the scattered resistance and went to work on a plan to eliminate the Fuhrer. These men had the idea to put themselves in charge as a Reserve Army government replacing the Third Reich after Hitlers death. ""Operation Valkyrie"" named for the riders of Wagners ""Ring Cycle"" was the name. Going into this film you know how things are going to come out. Hitler will not be assassinated. Still with actors as good as Tom Wilkinson Bill Nighy Thomas Kretschmann and Kenneth Branagh in supporting roles this ensemble piece avoids the usual action-movie triumphalism. It is after all a chronicle of failure.The aristocratic intellectual Col. Claus von Stauffenberg the assassination plots crucial player is played by Cruise and honestly he isnt bad in the role. Singer keeps him in check. Cruise however betrays some nervousness about being upstaged by so many sterling British character men. His counterstrategy keep the voice low keep the American dialect as neutral as possible and keep the bearing ramrod-straight. All the same Cruise cannot suggest the aristocratic hauteur or the steely authority needed in this role. Watching ""Valkyrie"" (which begins with a tense well-staged battle scene in 1943 Tunisia in which Stauffenberg nearly dies) you wonder why the German officer were rooting for is an American while most of the other Germans are British except Wilkinson who is English but really does seem like a Nazi. Theres also the matter of Stauffenberg himself. This cultured aesthete turned against his supreme commander for various reasons and his revulsion regarding the Final Solution may well have been one of them. Yet his letters to his wife years earlier contain various indications of ingrained anti-Semitism. ""Poland contained many Jews"" goes one bit of correspondence ""many people of mixed blood ... who are only happy when they are dominated."" As Alex Ross wrote in a 1997 Slate review of a Stauffenberg biography ""Stauffenbergs attitude toward Jews can be sensed in this inscrutable sentence from a resistance manifesto We want a New Order which makes all Germans supporters of the state and guarantees them law and justice but we scorn the lie of equality and we bow before the hierarchies established by nature. """"Valkyrie"" is not about Stauffenbergs change of heart. Its a procedural often absorbing rarely surprising about a briefcase bomb and a near-miss. Yet theres no question the film feels dodgy and vague when it comes to the personalities and ideology of the men onscreen. Does a big-budget project designed to turn a profit on its risky investment have an obligation to tell the whole truth about a historical figure? Of course not. But telling more of the truth wouldve made for a more provocative experience.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating PG-13 (for violence and brief strong language).Running time 200.Opening Dec. 25.Starring Tom Cruise (Col.

Born into aristocracy in 1907 he was a soldier by the age of 19--and by most accounts a warrior with the soul of a poet (he was especially smitten with the work of Stefan George a family friend) whod briefly considered becoming an architect before deciding ""Right duty first."" Hence his quick ascension through the ranks as befitting a soldier born in a castle.Depending upon which account you get Stauffenberg was either against the Nazis from the get-go or merely a distant detractor at first; in his book The History of the German Resistance 1933-1945 historian Peter Hoffmann (who receives a prominent thanks in Valkyries end credits) suggests that perhaps the country-firster even ""welcomed and supported the Nazi regime"" as he never spoke openly of his contempt for Hitlers National Socialists. But history offers myriad interpretations Several stories have Stauffenberg himself never a member of the party plotting to kill Hitler as early as 1942 after hed witnessed the mass murders committed by the Nazis during the invasion of the Soviet Union; others suggest he wasnt on his way to becoming a committed co-conspirator until April 1943 when during a stint in Africa his regiment was attacked by British bombers whose machine guns robbed the good soldier of his left eye his right hand and two fingers on his left.That attack is where Valkyrie director Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie--the tandem previously responsible for The Usual Suspects--begin their telling of Stauffenbergs attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler in the summer of 1944. (Nathan Alexander is also credited as a writer.) The lieutenant-colonel played by Tom Cruise argues with a superior about how alls lost out here in the sand and insists that its time to retreat. A moment later his higher-up is dead; so too are most of Stauffenbergs men. And so he is reborn a sworn enemy of the Fuhrer.But what truly fueled Stauffenbergs desire to kill Hitler--his breeding that bleeding or just his fear of the approaching Allies who were already in France--is a question for which Valkyrie has little interest. This is no more of a character study than Cruises Mission Impossible franchise was a three-part examination into the soul and psyche of Ethan Hunt. It pops up corn and serves it in a crystal bowl; this is cineplex hooey a footnote in history rendered shiny and wide-screen in order to prove that Cruise studio chief and actor is in control and that Singer can do more than men-in-tights movies.The intentions are noble to make a hero out of the forgotten man who tried to seize control of Germany in order to broker a truce with the Allies. But Valkyrie doesnt spend much time memorializing Stauffenberg; this isnt really Oscar fare even though its based-on-a-true-story baggage period clothing location setting and reputable A-list cast suggest as much. What to do with a movie that is impossible to spoil (you do know the ending right?) and winds up with the hero being assassinated by a coward? (Didnt work out very well for that Jesse James movie last year either--I mean the ending was right there in the title.)Well the supporting performances are uniformly top-notch by all actors wearing uniforms--especially Bill Nighy as General Friedrich Olbricht the true ringleader of the plot but also its Achilles heel at crucial moments. Nighy and Tom Wilkinson as the equally craven but also crueler General Friedrich Fromm bring gravitas to Valkyrie--kind of like Philip Seymour Hoffman in MI III who seemed to have filmed his scenes with one hand in the ATM. Nighy and Wilkinson are playing opposite ends of Valkyries spectrum Where Olbricht is brazen about his attempts to use Germanys reserve army to seize Berlin from the SS (Operation Valkyrie ahem) Fromm pretends he doesnt know whats going on as though silent compliance would somehow spare him from a Fuhrer whod take his own life months later. Kenneth Branagh and Eddie Izzard as compatriots in the conspiracy are more or less the Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg of Valkyrie which is to say ""perfectly fine"" and ""absolutely inconsequential.""As for Cruise his Stauffenberg has prompted twice now guessing games with friends and colleagues as to who would have been better in the role. Viggo Mortensens name keeps popping up for the sole reason that hes never bigger than his parts (and his range extends further than from A to A.) But Cruise is all we see here--Ethan Hunt in an eye patch pretending hes missing some fingers. (All hes really missing is the form-fitting mask.) Even when saying goodbye to his wife and kids for a final time Stauffenberg never seems like a man for whom theres anything at stake--maybe missed dinner reservations. Valkyrie feels like another installment in the never-ending franchise--not just the action-movie one but the Tom Cruise one. Like the operation itself its a good idea--just not well-executed.

(Courtesy of United Artists) Joe Neumaier Wednesday December 24 2008 501 PM A German officer plots to kill Hitler to save Germanys honor. With Tom Cruise Bill Nighy. Director Bryan Singer. (200) R Violence. At area theraters. If there are Nazis fighting other Nazis in a movie and its still boring somethings gone horribly wrong. ""Valkyrie"" has battalions of script problems and represents a whole new front in Tom Cruises never-ending public relations war but first and foremost theres the tedium. ""Valkyrie"" is like watching someone build a bomb and then never getting to see it explode. An overly feisty Cruise plays German Army officer Col. Claus von Stauffenberg whose negative view of Adolf Hitlers Nazi regime is set even before an attack in Tunisia blows off one hand several fingers on the other and his left eye. Returning to the Fatherland von Stauffenberg joins a movement to assassinate Hitler end his atrocities and if possible still win World War II. Von Stauffenberg proposes using Operation Valkyrie a plan that consists of a secret force ordered to contain civil disobedience in case Allied attacks isolate Hitler. All the conspirators need to do is freeze up the high command and get a well-placed explosive near the Fuhrer. Director Bryan Singer and his ""Usual Suspects"" writer Christopher McQuarrie try to jumble the puzzle by having the anti-Hitler officers (Kenneth Branagh Bill Nighy Terence Stamp Eddie Izzard) be a squabbling paranoid bunch. Singer ramps up the true storys plotting in an ill-fated attempt to keep reality from stomping on the excitement. Cruise - who can occasionally still surprise as ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Collateral"" showed - doesnt do himself any favors here. His penchant for disfiguring or masking his famous face (""Vanilla Sky"" ""Minority Report"") has hit the silly point yet hes still too showy to disappear into the role. Plus he may be the poofiest-haired Nazi in history. Despite a few intermittent thrills the lame ""Valkyrie"" ultimately leaves you wishing for that one big boom.

It happened in a July 20 1944 plot launched by a German colonel. ""Valkyrie"" refers not to the bombing attack but to what it precipitated a contingency signed by Hitler himself in case of an SS coup. And who better to play a one-eyed Euro- aristocrat named Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg than Syracuses own Tom Cruise? Alas though the actor who at age 46 - a decade older than his character - is still as fit as a rooster he has no more command presence than a high school quarterback. In the 70s a movie like this would have been wall-to-wall with alcoholics like Richard Burton and Robert Shaw. Cruise is still both too pretty and too American to play the kind of warrior who after losing seven fingers and an eye in a bombing raid goes back to work without complaint. The hodgepodge of nationalities in the casting (Kenneth Branagh Terence Stamp Tom Wilkinson and Thomas Kretschmann are on hand) as well as the way the plot advances by hushed conversations is much in the mold of 1960s movies in which serious men smoke cigarettes and move pieces on the chessboard of history. Cruise and pals dont bother to do anything but their native accents (wise move by director Bryan Singer - things could otherwise have turned into ""Fahr and Away"") as they conspire to terminate Hitler. More Valkyrie Director Stands By Cruise PopQuiz Tom Cruise An early scene in which Stauffenberg tries to get the Fuhrer to sign some revisions to the plan crackles with tension. Theres also a fine moment when the devout Catholic Stauffenberg prays for guidance in a church - where part of the roof appears to have been blown off. ""Valkyrie"" doesnt lack for suspense or stakes; you want to see how close the plot comes and why it fails. In a time when a whole movie can be built around such footnotes to footnotes to history as whether Richard Nixon will get around to sort of apologizing for Watergate during a TV interview the dizzying importance of whats happening here is always very apparent. The handling of the story - of opera-loving gentlemen who met secretly by twos in lavatories and forests to make risky but exciting propositions to each other - has a degree of camp and it can be lax on the details. Would Stauffenberg really chat so freely about high treason to everyone who wanders within earshot? And whats with pronouncing ""Goebbels"" ""Go Bells""? But the Third Reich was soaked in theater; the legends the flags the redoubts they themselves dubbed ""the Wolfs Lair"" and ""the Eagles Nest."" Given that it takes only a tweak to turn its leaders back into gleaming heel-clicking supervillains as they were for decades until the recent movie trend of giving WWII the art-house treatment. ""Any problem on earth can be solved with the careful application of high explosives"" says one character. Maybe not but it would be nice if so. Like many of the earlier WW II action yarns this one has a more than grudging respect for the steely codes of the German - not Nazi - spirit the thing that causes a man who realizes the game is over to briskly call out ""Id like a pistol please. For personal reasons."" The washed-out look the murderous da-DUNT score and the supporting cast (Stamp and Bill Nighy as a blanching co-conspirator are particularly good as is the perpetually weaselly Tom Hollander as an Adolphile who senses something is up) are all keenly chosen. The full story of ""Valkyrie"" has never received the full Hollywood feature treatment before. It was overdue. Its thrilling to consider how close this group of iron-willed patriots came to bringing about Hitlerdammerung. kyle.smithnypost.com VALKYRIE A few good men. Running time 120 minutes.

Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler. December 25 2008 ""Valkyrie"" Col. Claus von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise) attempts to assassinate Adolf Hitler. (MGM) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic An unfussy adult and stoic Tom Cruise anchors the World War II thriller Valkyrie. In a compact performance of nerve and rare glimpses of emotion Cruise is a leading man who takes us through a complex story and ennobles and personalizes events that have now almost faded into history.This Bryan Singer film is about the most famous attempt by Germans to kill the Fuehrer who led the world into war and Germany into horror. And it is about the man at the center of that conspiracy Claus von Stauffenberg. He was an army officer from German nobility that rare man with the resolve ""tenacity and determination "" historian Roger Moorhouse says in his book Killing Hitler to carry out an attempted coup to ""save Germany."" Valkyrie introduces the principals -- civilians struggling to find a way to seize control of government from a military dictatorship Wehrmacht officers appalled by the ""stain"" the mass murderer Hitler had brought to the Army.""We have to show the world that not all of us were like him"" longtime plotter Major General Henning von Tresckow ( Kenneth Branagh) reminds the others. Despite taking an oath of loyalty to Adolph Hitler himself Army officers were willing to attempt assassinations especially after the war turned unwinnable. Von Stauffenberg a Nazi hater early on lost an eye a hand and fingers in service to his country. But he was driven to feel he had one last duty he could perform for Germany.Singer (The Usual Suspects X-Men) ably handles the storys ticking-clock elements the many attempts that failed the rising stakes as the conspirators risk discovery and certain execution. The final attempt is filmed crisply in a way that hides the outcome even as the coup unfolds. Christopher McQuarries script gives us distinct personalities even if weve never heard of them. Theres the dithering general (Bill Nighy) the brave figurehead (Terrence Stamp) the opportunist in charge of the Home Guard (Tom Wilkinson) and the mysterious ""inside man"" ( Eddie Izzard) who may or may not help when the chips are down.But the movie sorely needs that conversion moment the ""kill everyone"" orders that tarred the army with the same civilian-murdering brush that the SS had. What resistance there was in the German military was born in those massacres. The film introduces von Stauffenbergs wife (Carice van Houten of Black Book) and small children letting us see what he has at stake. But it lacks the sense of desperation as they raced the clock trying to separate the nation and its people from the public face that the world was united to destroy.The historian David McCullough has often said that we must remember that the people taking part in great events dont have our gift of hindsight. They dont know how things will turn out. That informs Cruises performance as Stauffenberg. He isnt a fatalist sprinting toward his doom. He is pragmatic a poker-faced gambler willing to risk all because hes sure of himself and his abilities and he likes his odds.In Cruises hands von Stauffenberg comes off as a very human window into this history and this engrossing and involving movie.

After a long takeoff ""Valkyrie"" finally takes flight as a thriller in its second half but never soars very high. Bryan Singers long-awaited account of the near-miss assassination of Adolf Hitler by a ring of rebel German army officers on July 20 1944 has visual splendor galore but is a cold work lacking in the requisite tension and suspense. This second production from Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner at United Artists will do better than the first ""Lions for Lambs"" but is a decidedly odd choice for Christmas Day release and looks destined for just so-so commercial returns. Cruise himself is a bit stiff but still adequate as Col. Claus von Stauffenberg the handsome aristocratic officer whose disenchantment with Nazism the Fuehrer and the war finds sympathetic ears among a sizable number of military bigwigs at a time when the tide has turned against Germany in the East and an Allied invasion is expected imminently in the West. Well-carpentered script by Christopher McQuarrie reuniting with Singer for the first time since their joint career breakthrough on ""The Usual Suspects"" and Nathan Alexander must inevitably wrestle with the ""Day of the Jackal"" issue of the known failure of the central plot. Allowing for the need to compress and streamline events the scribes have hewed pretty closely to the facts but havent injected sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters. As if the filmmakers felt the need to placate modern viewers who might wonder why they should emotionally indulge Nazi authority figures the opening is swathed in Stauffenbergs feelings about how Hitler and the SS are a ""stain"" on the German army and his coincidentally contemporary desire for a ""change"" in the countrys leadership. Shortly after entering these sentiments into his diary while serving in Tunisia in 1943 Stauffenberg is badly injured and loses his right arm the last two fingers of his left hand and his left eye; with a black eyepatch he still looks quite dashing even if executing a Nazi salute with a prosthetic arm might appear rather irreverent. Slowly letting his insurrectionist sympathies show Stauffenberg is introduced to a circle of powerful men many of them old-school army officers whose conservative notions are closer to those of the Kaiser of their youth than to the rabid ideology of Hitler and the SS. Script unfortunately erases many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men notably the urgent belief of some that with Hitler gone they could join with the United States and Britain to beat back the Soviet Union and prevent the Bolshevization of Germany. What is perhaps most amazing about the plot is that so many people were involved and yet it was never detected with any certainty. Among the central figures Major-Gen. Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh) first seen trying to kill Hitler by sneaking a bomb onto the Fuehrers plane; retired Gen. Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp) a longtime Hitler opponent at the center of the military-civilian conspiracy; Gen. Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy) another veteran resistance figure still in a position of authority; Gen. Erich Fellgiebel (Eddie Izzard) whose role in charge of communications at Hitlers Wolfs Lair compound in East Prussia would be crucial to the plots chances; and the most equivocal figure Gen. Friedrich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson) commander in chief of the reserve army in Berlin and a cagey operator who artfully turns a blind eye to the conspirators activities while remaining cautiously loyal to the Reich. As it finally takes shape the plan hinges not just on eliminating the Fuehrer but on implementing a coup in Berlin. To this end Stauffenberg has the brilliant idea of turning Operation Valkyrie the code name for a measure enabling the reserve army to take control of Berlin in a national emergency to their own purposes. Stauffenberg thanks to his access will place a bomb in a briefcase underneath the large conference table during a briefing at Wolfs Lair while his associates in the capital will implement the government takeover as Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin. An ambitious plan to be certain one in which details large and small go wrong. Putting it on the screen in a clean classically derived style Singer is careful to make sure everything is clear to the viewer and emphasizes the sometimes daunting physical reality of things such as the difficulty Stauffenberg with only three fingers has in cutting the thick metal wire necessary to set the bombs fuse. Once Stauffenberg has set off the explosion and cleverly slips away convinced Hitler couldnt possibly have survived the pictures grip strengthens somewhat as the coup initially delayed ultimately stumbles forward. Due to interrupted lines no one in Berlin knows if Hitler is alive or dead and the films single haunting scene shows a room full of female communications operators slowly raising their hands one by one to indicate to their supervisor that they have received some news -- the Fuehrer is dead. It isnt long before evidence to the contrary comes through. The reserve army which has rounded up the SS and gone to arrest Goebbels (whose name Cruise for some reason makes rhyme with ""nobles"") is told to stand down and the tables are turned on the conspirators after a few heady hours. And Germany has nine months of devastation to look forward to. Storys fascination ironies missed opportunities implications and what-if aspects invest ""Valkyrie"" with automatic appeal for anyone interested in history in general and World War II in particular. But a nagging feeling persists throughout that the film should be more gripping than it is and that the men involved could have been revealed with more complexity and dimension. Cruise makes Stauffenberg a stalwart flawed and honorable man but reveals little sense of his stellar intellectual artistic and family background. The stars neutral Yank accent contrasts with the British voices that surround him but truth be told it is more the Anglo intonations coming out of the German characters that sound oddly disconcerting. Of the character actors Wilkinson most impresses with his robust presentation of an intriguingly Janus-like figure. David Bamber carries off a pretty plausible portrait of the declining Hitler in a handful of scenes. Although it would have looked like inappropriate stunt casting in this context the suspicion nonetheless persists that the contemporary English-speaking actor who would make the most interesting screen Hitler is former Singer cohort Kevin Spacey. Pics standout elements are the locations and the superb production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb which convey a palpable sense of legendary historical sites such as the War Ministry Wolfs Lair Hitlers Berghof residence and the Benderblock (the executions of Stauffenberg and others were lensed at the actual spot). A couple Junkers three-engine planes of the sort used by Hitler are impressively employed and attention to detail is felt down the line. Newton Thomas Sigels lensing has a restrained elegance and John Ottman once again doubles adroitly as editor and composer. The conspiracy has inspired at least four previous pictures two German productions of the mid-1950s the 1990 American telefilm ""The Plot to Kill Hitler"" which starred the late Brad Davis as Stauffenberg and the widely praised 2004 German TV production ""Stauffenberg"" with Sebastian Koch in the title role.
