Now the midmorning midden of childrens cartoons that proved a source of comedic cinematic gold a couple of years ago with George of the Jungle has been mined for a clinker called Inspector Gadget. Too bad because this Disney comedy wastes a lot of good talent from stars like Matthew Broderick Rupert Everett and Joely Fisher to supporting players like Dabney Coleman and Michelle Trachtenberg to the armies of technical wizards enlisted to make convincing its tale of a bumbling bionic policeman. But truth to tell watching Inspector Gadget is like watching a human Swiss Army knife for nearly an hour and a half. Its a remarkable gizmo but do you really want to spend a whole lot of time with a not-too-bright hardware store Frankstein creation that can light cigars with his thumb pick locks with other fingers extend his legs and neck shoot a grappling hook to the top of a skyscraper and produce a helicopter from his head? Most of what passes for attitude and sass in Inspector Gadget directed by David Kellog whose credits include Jerry Seinfeld commercials for American Express comes from the Gadgetmobile with the voice of D. L. Hughley. This vehicle is equipped with eyes a mind of its own a stock of brand-name sodas burgers and candy and a willingness to let Inspector Gadget (Mr. Broderick) know that as sleuths go he is strictly a rookie. As usual Mr. Broderick brings an endearing combination of intelligence wit and naivete to his portrayal of John Brown a security guard eager for a job on the Riverton police force who is transformed into Inspector Gadget after being blown up in an effort to capture the evil magnate Sanford Scolex (Mr. Everett). But even Mr. Broderick can go only so far with the films noisy childish material. Scolex accompanied by his hulking henchman Sikes (Michael G. Hagerty) and abetted by robotic devices has invaded the laboratory of kindly Artemus Bradford (Rene Auberjonois) killed the old scientist and made off with the mind-controlled robotic foot he has developed. Poor Brown who lives with his bright niece Penny (Ms. Trachtenberg) is all but killed trying to thwart Scolexs getaway but with the help of the woman of his dreams Artemuss scholarly daughter Brenda (Ms. Fisher) Brown is restored to function as a robocop. The surly police chief (Mr. Coleman) who regards the new Inspector Gadget as a cross between Columbo and Nintendo is not amused and assigns him to school crossing guard duties and rescuing cats from trees with his extended arms. But Inspector Gadget has vowed to bring the killer of Artemus Bradford to justice and so he will even if it means doing battle with his nasty doppelganger Robogadget (Mr. Broderick again) a creation of the megalomaniacal Scolex who plans world domination with an army of androids who need no food or sleep and never say no. The outcomes of Inspector Gadget in terms of justice and romance are never for a moment in doubt. The material is familiar and a few genuine jokes including a Minion Recovery Group filled with henchmen from other films like Mr. T Odd Job and Jaws are tossed to the adults like raw meat to starving lions. But in the end the elaborate gimmickry of Inspector Gadget cannot conceal its very ordinary storytelling. Inspector Gadget is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes a few mild sexual innuendos and jokes and violence that should not unhinge regular moviegoers. INSPECTOR GADGET Directed by David Kellogg; written by Kerry Ehrin and Zak Penn based on characters created by Andy Heyward Jean Chalopin and Bruno Bianchi; director of photography Adam Greenberg; edited by Thom Noble and Alan Cody; music by John Debney; production designers Michael White and Leslie Dilley; produced by Jordan Kerner Roger Birnbaum and Mr. Heyward; released by Walt Disney Pictures.

Based on a cartoon series this latest attempt to launch a Disney kiddie franchise stars Matthew Broderick as Inspector Gadget a half-human half-android crime fighter who issues a trademark command of ""Go go gadget ... magnifying glass"" (or whatever it is he needs) to convert his limbs digits and trusty fedora into every imaginable gizmoid contraption. His thumb opens into a cigarette lighter his fingers sport a skeleton key and bubble wand and helicopter blades whirl right out of his hat. Hes like a pop-up-book fusion of Edward Scissorhands RoboCop and a Swiss Army knife. The trouble is each feat of animatronic wizardry lasts for about five seconds. (You only wish that Rupert Everetts mincingly grotesque performance as the villain lasted that long.) Chasing down some bad guys Gadget will sprout say a pair of spring-wired stilt legs and the movie then cuts to a boring close-up of Matthew Brodericks face as hes ""running."" The entire image of this kitchen-magician dream robot comes at us in little jolts and spasms that have the zappy self-contained rhythm of a fast-food tie-in commercial. In a Disney romp like Flubber goofy and dumb as it was Robin Williams whos practically a special effect himself knew how to dance and joke around his ricocheting Jell-O costar. Broderick on the other hand simply looks flabbergasted. He does finally lighten up a bit as Gadgets evil twin a ""bad"" robot whose nightmare choppers make him resemble one of those rubber Richard Nixon masks. His gadgets including some major machine guns go by with similar perfunctory flash but Broderick at least looks like hes getting a kick out of them.

Don Adams A new standard for wretched excess is established by ""Inspector Gadget"" a joyless and charmless disaster in which state-of-the-art special effects are squandered on pain-in-the-backside folly. Loosely based on the 1980s TV cartoon series about a bumbling bionic crime-fighter this live-action misadventure isnt likely to spark renewed interest in its source material. Nor is it likely to improve Disneys B.O. batting average after its recent run of non-animated underachievers. Pic is written acted and directed in a style broad enough to indicate that the presumptive target audience consists of young moppets with extremely short attention spans. But many preschoolers may be upset if not frightened by the shrill sound and fury. Like many other live-action pics drawn from videogames and TV cartoons this misfire grossly overestimates the novelty value of turning human beings into special effects. And perhaps more than any other would-be summer blockbuster in recent memory ""Inspector Gadget"" proves that if you dont have engaging characters or an entertaining story you run the risk of eliciting a collective sigh of ""So what?"" Matthew Broderick stars as John Brown an idealistic security guard who longs to join the police force of Riverton City. While working at a technological research facility he springs into action when intruders kill scientist Artemus Bradford (Rene Auberjonois) and flee with their victims latest invention. Brown pursues the culprits -- evil billionaire Sanford Scolex (Rupert Everett) and his flunky (Michael G. Hagerty) -- who counterattack by tossing an explosive into Browns car. Scolex loses a hand in the resulting conflagration. But thats nothing compared with what happens to the security guard. Indeed there isnt much left of our hero when hes wheeled into the hospital. So Brenda Bradford (Joely Fisher) Artemus daughter resorts to drastic measures. Applying the experimental technology designed by her father she implants several thousand handy-dandy devices in the dying security guard giving him a new lease on life as a gizmo-enhanced cyborg and renaming him Inspector Gadget -- an entirely appropriate moniker for a guy who can extend his hydraulic arms across rooms sprout Rollerblades from his feet and detach his ear to use as a long-distance surveillance device. Gadget is assigned to the Riverton City police department whose cynical chief (Dabney Coleman) is unimpressed by the prospect of employing ""Columbo and Nintendo all rolled into one."" Even so Gadget resolves to find the killers of Brendas father. And his determination grows all the more intense when -- now heres a novel plot twist -- he falls in love with the lovely scientist. Meanwhile Scolex -- who gleefully nicknames himself Claw after replacing his severed hand with steel pincers -- schemes to exploit the late Artemus innovations. As a kind of warm-up exercise he designs a robotic copy of Brenda. But he really hits his stride when he constructs an evil doppelganger of Inspector Gadget -- RoboGadget (also played by Broderick). In one of the pics few genuinely clever scenes RoboGadget stalks through Riverton City on massively extended legs terrorizing citizens and wreaking havoc with all the ferocity of a certain giant lizard who recently co-starred with Broderick. Here and elsewhere its obvious that the production team invested a prodigious amount of time money and effort in replicating the fantastical sci-fi elements of the ""Inspector Gadget"" cartoons. Tech values are lavish across the board and the pic is full of such spectacular thingamajigs as the Gadgetmobile (voiced by D.L. Hughley) a sentient high-speed vehicle that looks like something left over from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" But none of this is likely to overwhelm audiences in an age when even the most wondrous computer-generated imagery is taken for granted. Under the frantic direction of first-time feature helmer David Kellogg the film careens from scene to scene like a Ritalin-deprived problem child. The acrid stench of desperation permeates the enterprise as actors struggle to convince the audience -- and quite possibly themselves -- that louder and broader somehow equals funnier. Broderick makes a game effort but overdoes the gee-whiz ingenuousness. Everett is disappointingly pedestrian as the villain of the piece but at least he evinces restraint as he goes through the motions. Other members of the cast pop their eyes flutter their hands and make silly faces all in the vain hope of wringing laughs from Kerry Ehrin and Zak Penns pathetically unfunny script. Even with an interminable closing-credits crawl ""Inspector Gadget"" clocks in at 77 minutes making it one of this decades shortest major studio releases. Unfortunately some pictures can never really be short enough.

Starring Matthew Broderick and Rupert Everett. Directed by David Kellogg. (Rated PG. At Bay Area theaters. 90 minutes.) Technology finally freaks out in the mechanical man at the heart of ""Inspector Gadget."" He could be the poster boy for Y2K. The new live-action feature from Disney is in its own way just as much of a cartoon as ""Tarzan."" Its almost as much of a wonder too. It is one of two special-effects extravaganzas along with ""The Haunting"" that open today. The mechanical shenanigans begin with a delightful version of the Disney logo. The eponymous hero is a meek security guard with dreams of becoming a law-enforcement officer. When he is blown up and reassembled as the technological whiz Inspector Gadget he gets his wish. He is not exactly a Man of Steel. More like his dorky cousin. In this fable there are echoes of other comic-book heroes -- his jive-talking automobile with its cool bouncy moves is a parody of the Batmobile and he has a magic command like Captain Marvels ""Shazam."" Other figures from our collective childhood come to mind -- most prominently the Tin Man who finds his heart. As with that character from ""The Wizard of Oz"" it is the human element that counts. Interestingly in the making of this film it is the human element that counts too. While it is a spectacle of animatronics digital graphics and other special effects the actors are never overwhelmed by them as personalities. Matthew Broderick as Inspector Gadget displays a right-on repertoire of physical comedy with his comic- book body language. The usually silky-toned Rupert Everett does an interesting change of pace as the campy villain Claw (""one word like Madonna""). The 90-minute film goes by in an eye-popping flash of quick scenes. They make their point and move on which shouldnt be a surprise considering director David Kelloggs TV commercial expertise. Each visual punch line gets its laugh and then is immediately topped by another. Security guard John Brown (Broderick) stumbles onto a plot by the villainous Sanford Scolez who will become Claw and is blasted to pieces. This Humpty Dumpty is put back together by Brenda the scientist (Joely Fisher) as a prototype cyber-police officer. When the rebuilt John Brown dons the Gadget Suit -- a neat raincoat nebbishy necktie and narrow- brimmed hat -- and says the magic words he sprouts mechanical appurtenances. Springs pop out of the soles of his shoes his fingers turn into appliances and his arms stretch. In a nice little touch Inspector Gadgets head sounds like a rattle when he nods. The film becomes of matter of dueling mad scientists. Scolez who lost his hand when a bowling ball fell out of the sky (dont ask) creates Inspector Gadgets evil twin -- the teeth are the giveaway -- to wreak havoc instead of doing good. Fisher who will be playing Sally Bowles in the tour of the musical ""Cabaret"" also gets to show another face as Brendas evil twin. Anyone who saw Broderick dance in the stage version of ""How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying"" will not be surprised by his moves. Everett who may have the most beautiful voice in movies today here shows some of the almost whispered concentration he used as Oberon in ""A Midsummer Nights Dream"" but adds some unexpected squawks. He seems relieved to have a chance to camp it up. Andy Dick plays Igor to Everetts Dr. Frankenstein. A nod to televisions ""Six Million Dollar Man"" provides a neat joke for Dabney Coleman as the police chief. Cheri Oteri has a nice turn as the perky mayor who never misses a photo op D.L. Hughley is the hipster voice of the Gadgetmobile and Michelle Trachtenberg is Penny who along with her dog always figures everything out. Be sure to stick around for the credits and catch the Minion Recovery Group led by Michael Hagerty as another Claw accomplice. There is a dazzling high-speed race through the streets of Pittsburgh where the film was shot. At times ""Inspector Gadget"" goes by in such a whirlwind that the viewers head will be spinning too. ..
