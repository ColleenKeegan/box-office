By David Denby Freida Pinto and James Franco with Caesar whos the prime primate?   Credit Illustration by STEVE BRODNER Among the trillions of binary digits skittering across screens this summer a vibrant minority have been gathered into a shrewd coherent and fully felt movie. Im speaking of the expertly crafted ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" by far the best spectacle movie of the season and one of the few films to use digital technology for nuanced dramatic effect. ""Planet"" of course draws on the old species-reversal conceit worked out by Pierre Boulle in his 1963 novel ""La Planete des Singes"" a book that launched a cluster of movies and television shows most notably Franklin J. Schaffners ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968). In that mock epic the manacled nearly naked Charlton Heston is rated an interesting specimen by a variety of simian overlords. The new movie draws not only on Boulles outrageous idea but on some of the most enduringly suggestive fables we know. It begins as a benevolent version of the Frankenstein story. Will (James Franco trying harder than usual) a young genetic engineer working for a San Francisco biotech company creates a serum that reverses brain damage. (He wants to treat his father Charles--played movingly by John Lithgow--who has Alzheimers.) The company tests the serum on apes one of which goes mad and has to be destroyed. But Will takes home the apes baby Caesar who has inherited his moms supercharged gray matter and he and Charles raise him as a pet. Caesar swings through the house leaping up and down stairs and throwing himself in and out of the attic but he sits quietly at the dinner table too. He listens he grunts he eats he makes signs. Hes a darling little ape but theres a joke buried in our wonderment we all anthropomorphize our pets finding spirit even conscience in beautiful collies in cool blue-eyed Siamese cats in potbellied pigs. Out of affection we see what we want to see of ourselves. But Caesar really is like us in many ways. He plays and chatters like a chimp but like a child he needs protection and reassurance and then--a fellow-primate to the rescue--he rushes to the defense of Charles his ailing ""grandfather"" when hes attacked by a neighbor. An empathic ape The screenwriters Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver and the director Rupert Wyatt create many small gestures glances and pauses that anchor the improbable turns of the story. At one point Charles confused holds a fork by the wrong end and Caesar slowly gently takes it out of his hand and turns it around. The scene is ineffably absurdly touching the sweetest expression of family love seen in recent films. Pierre Boulles novel was sardonic even maliciously satirical--science fiction with a tickle. But ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" discovers a new emotion what youd have to call interspecies pathos. Andy Serkis who was the emaciated depraved ground-hugging Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy plays Caesar--that is he lends his body and face covered with reflective markers to image-makers who then employing the techniques of motion capture create a digitized simulacrum of an ape but an ape that has unrivalled flexibility and expressiveness. The filmmakers have pulled off a stunning paradox Caesar is much more human than an entirely digitized creation and much more apish than an actual ape--faster stronger more exuberant in his knuckle-dragging chin-thrusting lunging glory. Caesar becomes an adolescent; hormones kick in and he turns violent doing bongo numbers on his enemies with his fists. At last digital fantasy means something we are not watching a dull-brained superhero banging off walls like a fly in a bottle; we are watching an animal with suddenly enhanced powers who still behaves recognizably like an animal. But a juiced-up ape can become something more than fun for us--he can shock us with his power even inspire terror. Theres a premonition early in the film when a leashed German shepherd barks at Caesar he roars back at the dog and then climbing into Wills car surly and sad he signs with his hands that he feels like a pet--its a complaint a question and a challenge. A second fable moves into place. The violent Caesar gets sent to an ape compound where hes forced through steel mazes prodded and stun-gunned. The imprisonment is unbearable he experiences the humiliation that a mere dumb animal would never feel. Gorillas orangutans and other chimps live with him in the compound and Caesar quickly becomes a leader of apes. For a while the movie turns into the latest version of ""Escape from Alcatraz"" reaching its climax in a single syllable a roaring ""No""--Caesars first word a refusal that caused the audience when I saw the movie to go ape. Caesar spreads the serum to the other animals and what starts as a prison revolt quickly becomes a species revolt. The changes in the apes intelligence are so vivid that we experience the alterations as a stirring birth--the origins of revolutionary consciousness--even though it is we humans in the end who will get overthrown. In a truly creepy moment Caesar goes back to the house in which he was raised and stares silently at Will and his girlfriend (Freida Pinto) in bed together. The scene marks a sexy return to Boulles idea for apes human behavior becomes an object of avid curiosity and study. And we wonder Whos the prime primate at the top of the species hierarchy? The position is suddenly up for grabs. Digitized acting (if thats the right phrase) should be as warmly recognized as any other kind of acting. When Will arrives at the pen intending to take Caesar home the ape sees the leash in Wills hands and sorrowfully but firmly closes the door of the cell--staying behind with his own kind forever. To register the moment Serkis lengthens his jaw in sullen resolve turns his back and gives Caesar a regretful shudder--the scene is almost tragic. Throughout the movie the filmmakers capture tiny changes in mood and physical appearance and the grand effects are startling. Finally the apes break free running all over San Francisco busting into the biotech companys corporate headquarters and liberating the remaining apes in Wills lab. For once the riot of movement is exhilarating rather than just extravagant. Ive seen dozens of digital creatures and endless cars smashing through windows but when the freed apes like water bursting through a dam pour through the buildings glass walls at different levels the image is a pop epiphany of freedom. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is spectacle with a kick the transcendence of the normal in creatures so like ourselves is both an entertainment and a needling rebuke to human vanity. Digital is here to stay but this terrific movie tells us that its time to move on from the current cliches. The superheroes and the thundering plastic toys need to be tossed into the back of the closet where they belong. If invention wild and free yet tied to emotion and philosophical speculation is given a chance digital filmmaking could have a more brilliant future than any we can now imagine. Lawyer friends tell me that the plain tiffs who bring test cases the suits that change laws--overturning discriminatory statutes for instance--are often cranky obsessional people (not debonair dinner guests at all) and the same is often true of whistle-blowers who try sometimes without success to alert the world to grand-scale larcenous behavior. The documentary ""Chasing Madoff"" written and directed by Jeff Prosserman is devoted to one such awkward person--Harry Markopolos who was working as a portfolio manager in a Boston options-trading firm when in 1999 his colleague Frank Casey handed him some of Bernard Madoffs monthly statements. Casey challenged Markopolos to use the statements to reverse-engineer the investment model that could produce such extraordinary results. Within five minutes Markopolos sensed that the returns had to be fictional and he became sure of it when he plotted on a graph the rising quarterly gains year after year and wound up with a virtually straight forty-five-degree angle. The options market simply doesnt work that way Madoff had to be running a Ponzi scheme with controlled returns steadying the flow. Exposing Madoff became Markopoloss intellectual and moral quest his mania his life. Much of ""Chasing Madoff"" is recreated scenes with Markopolos in the present clumsily walking through actions that he took years ago all of this interspersed with interviews. The hero has a colorless off-rhythm voice dead eyes disorderly hair. Hes not we gather an imaginative man but a religious Greek Orthodox and a former Army officer hes propelled by a strong sense of rectitude an ethos of duty. Markopolos got nowhere with his repeated complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission and fared no better with investment heavies in New York many of whom he and Casey say knew that Madoffs operation was fishy but were loath to pull the plug on an outfit from which so many powerful people had made serious money. The movie ends in bitterness. Unable to prevent catastrophe the most honorable man in this entire affair--an outcast among frauds and the cannily acquiescent--considers himself a failure.

Aficionados will note that the plot echoes elements of Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) the fourth movie in an already etiolated series. There are also some in-jokes with the 1968 original even glimpsed on a TV screen at one point. Crucially though the events are seen from the point of view of the chimpanzee Caesar a CGI creature infused with an uncanny nascent humanity by performance-capture master Andy Serkis. The nature of the human/ ape conflict has changed too with the racial discrimination so topical in the civil rights era of the late 60s supplanted by contemporary fears about scientists who play God by experimenting on inferior species.The chimp-based research into brain tissue regeneration conducted by scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) for pharmaceutical company GenSys does have a human element; his once musically talented father Charles (John Lithgow) now has Alzheimers. Even so Rodman concedes that the anarchic aggression displayed by the lab chimps dosed with experimental drug ALZ-112 means that they must be destroyed. However when the unborn child of chimp Bright Eyes survives this cull Will takes him home names him Caeser and continues his discredited research in secret. As Wills father regains his faculties Caeser grows from an inquisitive infant into a strong super-intelligent adult chimp one with human emotions but also a dangerous aggressive streak. On the insistence of beautiful primatologist Caroline (Freida Pinto) Will exiles Caesar to the San Bruno Primate Sanctuary where neglect by its owner Landon (Brian Cox) and the cruelties meted out by his son Dodge (Tom Felton) provoke the chimp into fomenting an ape rebellion. Once free the weapon-wielding apes invade the streets of San Francisco terrorising and killing its human inhabitants.Despite a quantum leap from his low-budget British prison movie The Escapist to this 90 million blockbuster director Rupert Wyatt stages the climactic battle on the citys Golden Gate Bridge - a stunning set-piece featuring hundreds of life-like apes - with remarkable assurance. He also strives to match the philosophical seriousness of the first Apes film but his handling of the underdeveloped characters is never as convincing as the visual effects work. Also particularly in the ferocious battle scenes there is far too much special pleading on behalf of the selectively violent apes.

I wonder whether the film is mostly comprised of British actors playing Americans excluding Franco and John Lithgow because they were all cheap compared to well known Americans playing the same roles. Most of the budget seems to have gone on the CGI apes (and certainly most of the manpower is in this area if you sit through the massive list of CGI artists and ancillary workers in the end credits). Cox goes through the motions Felton reprises his spoilt brat act from Harry Potter and Pinto is more wooden than the giant redwoods in the film. The film though belongs to Serkis and Franco who are superb. It sadly has the ongoing franchise opener ending written all over it with more questions left open than answered. Worth seeing.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 13 2011EvieFeaturedI honestly wanted to like this film but couldnt get over the feeling that I was watching computer generated chimps and the cast were acting to empty space. Theres not one memorable line in the movie that is not already in the trailer. It fails to build the tension so its only slightly less boring when the apes finally go ape-sht. I really liked The Escapist but it seems on this film the director was out of his depth. He should watch a JJ Abrams film or two before he attempts another blockbusterFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 13 2011MarsellusFeaturedBest film of Summer 2011. Franco is good but (oddly) the main actor in the film is a completely animated thing. Although its clear were not looking at a real ape the SFX are still amazing; the colour of the eyes the texture of the hair and the life-like facial expressions. The original Apes films suffered from lack of budget and poor makeup effects (I still enjoyed them though). This new version has the budget and necessary effects to tell the story the way it should be told. There are a few updates and changes here and there but this film is essentially a remake/reboot of Conquest. Fingers crossed it makes enough at the box office to warrant a sequel.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 13 2011RobertFeaturedPretty good.

But it does appear hardly necessary. After all the cult-adored 1968 movie starring Charlton Heston and Roddy McDowall as man and humanoid chimp begat many a sequel. It also led to a television series (and a misbegotten reboot by Tim Burton in 2001). Yet here comes the prequel. And its an engaging one at that. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" -- starring James Franco Freida Pinto and Andy Serkis -- recounts how the humanoid apes of the original film came to be. Bioethics will be damned in this animals- wronged fable that ever so mildly poses questions about nature versus nurture versus genetic tinkering. Cages will be rattled. Humans will face an ultra-bright adversary and suffer from our own hubris. San Franciscos Golden Gate Bridge will serve as the site (and metaphor?) for the clash of thoughtful ape with unruly well- armed man. (Forget the opposable thumb; lets talk about the trigger finger.) Franco stars as Will Rodman researcher for Gen-Sys a pharmaceutical company. John Lithgow portrays the father whose memory is blinkering. But the movies truer stars are Serkis who portrays the whiz-chimp Caesar once hes grown and the special effects masters at WETA Digital who utilize motion-capture technology to deliver Serkis performance and relate Caesars many moods. Are the FXd apes perfect? Not exactly. But theyre a fascinating amalgam of creatures that arent pure ape. And they represent a more evolved filmmaking option than wrangling animals on a set. Directed by Brit Rupert Wyatt ""Rise"" begins with a few visceral PG-13 flourishes. There is a vivid repressed-memory flashback of a research chimpanzee at Gen-Sys. Then theres an adrenalized and amusing bit that depicts what happens when enthusiasm -- corporate and personal -- gets out ahead of proper science. After a seeming breakthrough Rodman gives Gen-Sys funders a pitch for his project. Meanwhile things at the lab are getting a little chaotic. A chimpanzee is going ape. The sequence promises to balance the serious and the slightly silly. More often than not ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" keeps that pledge. At times the script trucks in too much cookie-cutter malfeasance. A neighbor has anger- management issues. A corporate honcho rushes a drug that hasnt been properly tested. A primate-shelter employee lords his power over the caged. But two of the baddies are made better with underplayed performances by Brian Cox as the head of the shelter and father of the miscreant Dodge (Tom Felton of Draco Malfoy fame) and David Oyelowo as Gen-Sys top exec. Lovely Pinto (""Slumdog Millionaire"") arrives as Caroline veterinarian speaker of nagging ethical quandaries and Wills love interest. ""I love chimpanzees but I fear them"" she says agog at Caesars intelligence. Written by married team Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver the movie has some plot-point missteps. But it seldom puts the brakes on a story that moves toward a furious ape-human rumble not in a jungle but atop the Golden Gate Bridge. So who will be Caesars Brutus? ""Rise"" provides a candidate.

(And not just because one of its stars is Freida Pinto an actress making a career of cardboard thespianism.) Constructed around the reliable premise that if you slather on the spectacle audiences wont notice the scripts idiocies -- otherwise known as the Avatar effect -- this so-called origin picture is no more than a narrative outline padded with moderately special effects a teaser for the sequels that will surely follow. What is less clear is whether this Project Nim for the masses is sufficiently supersized to satisfy our jaded visual appetites. Opting for James Franco over 3-D (few budgets can stretch to both) the filmmakers leave him stranded opposite blue screens and a bland veterinary love interest (Pinto) his cheeky charisma obliterated by the movies rampaging simians. Playing Will Rodman a San Francisco geneticist with a dementia-stricken father (John Lithgow) Franco has never been so lost He seems to know hes being outperformed by every computer-generated chimp on-screen. Researching a drug for Alzheimers Will is forced to shut down his animal testing when one of his apes goes ballistic in the lab. Swiftly euthanizing the beast he smuggles its baby out of the facility unaware that it has inherited the drugs effects from its mother. Installed in Wills attic and answering to the name Caesar the animal is soon exhibiting intelligence far beyond its pay grade; eight years later looking like a 30-year-old construction worker and treated like an adoptive son Caesar (realized in motion capture by the brilliant Andy Serkis) is using silverware and sign language and coordinating preppy separates. In other words hes already smarter than the films scriptwriters. When the inevitable happens and Caesars true nature surfaces its off to primate prison under the sadistic stewardship of Brian Cox and Tom Felton (reprising his Draco Malfoy scowl perhaps because hes saddled with spouting the most iconic line from the 1968 Planet of the Apes). By the time Caesar joins forces with a circus orangutan and subdues an ugly monkey cursed with poxy skin and a milky eye he has risen to the top of the moth-eaten pack and the stage is set for revolution. i Geneticists Caroline (Freida Pinto) and Will (James Franco) spend most of the film watching helplessly as their own creations do them in -- thereby granting Pinto and Franco the unique dishonor of being out-acted by fake animals. 20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption 20th Century Fox Geneticists Caroline (Freida Pinto) and Will (James Franco) spend most of the film watching helplessly as their own creations do them in -- thereby granting Pinto and Franco the unique dishonor of being out-acted by fake animals. 20th Century Fox A creature feature of disappointing stupidity -- what woman in her right mind would date a guy joined at the hip to a giant leashed ape? -- Rise of the Planet of the Apes replaces the sociopolitical underpinnings of the original film and its sequels with a limp warning about the evils of animal testing. Those early movies may look cheesy now but the guys in the monkey suits at least gave Charlton Heston something solid to respond to. The stars of this incarnation like the sick chimps of 28 Days Later are just barreling balls of unspecified quadruped fury swarming over the Golden Gate Bridge and tossing manhole covers like discuses. For all we know they could be protesting the lack of primate roles on network television. Directed by an overwhelmed Rupert Wyatt (the talented force behind the tiny gem The Escapist) Rise is most memorable for its uncanny ability to breathe life into Caesar. Evincing more visible intelligence than any of his human co-stars aside from Lithgow Caesar is disquietingly lifelike. Yet this very success may also be the films most alienating feature and I am grateful to the colleague at the screening I attended who reminded me of the phenomenon known as the ""uncanny valley."" Coined by robotics professor Masahiro Mori to describe our revulsion to replicas that look almost -- but not quite -- human the phenomenon looms larger with each new generation of computer effects. Ten years ago as the nonhuman in AI Artificial Intelligence a flesh-and-blood boy broke our hearts; it remains to be seen whether the reverse can do the same.

Those words memorably uttered by Charlton Heston in the original 1968 Planet of the Apes began a contentious interspecies dialogue that was to persist through four cinematic sequels two short-lived TV series one attempted (and best forgotten) 2001 reboot and now another Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Hestons iconic line recurs in this movie though with the context largely reversed This time out the human speaker is a brutal jailer (Tom Felton) and the insulted ape his sympathetic captive. James Franco is nearly as listless as he was while handing out Academy Awards earlier this year Though Rise of the Planet of the Apes does not fit directly into the mythos of the earlier films it takes its cues from the third and fourth installments (Escape from and Conquest of respectively). In them advanced chimps from the far future played by Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter time-warped to the present where they gave birth to a baby Caesar who would eventually grow up to lead the ape rebellion--a variation of the self-contained time loop later adopted by the Terminator franchise. In the new film directed by Rupert Wyatt Caesar is again the protagonist and head-ape-to-be though his origins are somewhat more humble. A pharmaceutical chemist named Will Rodman (James Franco) has been testing a new anti-Alzheimers gene therapy on chimpanzees who undergo astonishing cognitive enhancements as a result. Alas just as he is selling his corporate board of directors on the need to conduct human trials his star subject a chimp named ""Bright Eyes"" rampages violently into the boardroom and is shot dead by security. The board needless to say is not amused and Wills project is canceled. He soon discovers though that Bright Eyes has left behind a newborn son whom he takes home and names Caesar. The young chimp has inherited his mothers augmented intelligence and the first third or so of the movie frequently has a bit of a hokey Bedtime for Bonzo vibe as Will takes Caesar for a romp among Bay Area redwoods and Caesar helps Will get a date with a comely veterinarian (Freida Pinto). But ominous musical spikes suggest rougher times lie ahead and sure enough Caesar gradually becomes aware that he is a chimp apart neither pet nor person. Following an altercation with a preternaturally obnoxious neighbor he is collected by Animal Control and remitted to the custody of a corrupt keeper (Brian Cox) and his snidely sadistic sidekick (Felton). It is only a matter of time before Caesar releases himself on his own recognizance along with a platoon of other imprisoned--and appropriately P.O.d--primates. More On Summer FilmsUniversalThe Science of Apes Could Simians Get Scary Smart?Universal5 Lessons from Life-Switching Films Like The Change-UpWBThe Summer of Retro Sci-FiWBAre The Smurfs Sexist?ParamountThe 9 Strangest Harry Potter Controversies To a striking degree Rise of the Planet of the Apes is half good and half bad and the primary dividing line is by genus. To begin with the good Caesar and his fellow chimps orangutans and gorillas are marvels of motion-capture--that is CGI based on the movements of human actors. (Joe Letteri whos won multiple special-effects Oscars most recently for Avatar handled the translation from flesh to pixel.) Caesar himself is ""played"" by Andy Serkis who owns perhaps the most peculiar niche in the film industry having performed the same role for The Lord of the Rings Gollum and the 2005 version of King Kong. Caesar is by far the most expressive character in the film by turns playful and touching in the first domestic act; confused and forlorn at the outset of his captivity; and stoic and resolute as he takes fate into his own long-fingered hands. The films ""prison"" scenes in particular offer a cunning twist on the genre as Caesar gradually establishes himself as the Ape Who Can Get Things Done on the Inside. When Caesar and his legions ultimately liberate themselves the ensuing action sequences are for once not a letdown. A scene of simians silhouetted against the nighttime sky and another of leaves falling on a sunny suburban street as the ape army marches through the foliage above are among the more evocative of the summer season. Were treated to apes bursting through windows apes loping across rooftops and over stopped cars apes brandishing fence-pickets as spears and hurling discus-like manhole covers. When it comes the climactic confrontation with police on the Golden Gate Bridge is clever in conception and sharp in execution. Alas the apes human counterparts let them down from the very start. In what is billed as the films lead role Franco is nearly as listless as he was while handing out Academy Awards earlier this year. Indeed there are stretches when his Will seems less a character than a narrative device offering a tiresome series of expository voiceovers. As we watch Caesar display feats of extraordinary intelligence Will explains to a tape recorder--remember hes a scientist--that Caesar is extraordinarily intelligent; as Wills dad recovers from Alzheimers thanks to his sons revolutionary treatment Will informs the tape recorder that his dad is recovering etc. etc. These explanatory interludes are so flat and unnecessary that it occasionally seems the filmmakers suspect their audience too is in need of gene therapy to improve memory and cognition. Nor do things improve as one works through the cast. John Lithgow is perfectly reliable as the Dad With Alzheimers but David Oyelowo barely achieves caricature as the Greedy Pharmaceutical Exec and Pinto makes almost no impression at all as the Underwritten Girlfriend. As the nasty zookeep Felton freshly retired from a decade of playing Draco Malfoy does little more than establish himself as Hollywoods go-to guy for adolescent sneering. And Im at rather a loss regarding why Cox is in the film at all. In the performers defense the script (by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver) though agile enough when the apes are onscreen stumbles nearly every time human dialogue or motivation are required and treats the real-life ramifications of say owning a chimpanzee or conducting drug trials (you dont actually move to human subjects after a successful test on a single animal) with studious contempt. Wyatts direction too is sloppy and unfocused--a particular disappointment given that his previous feature was the humane meticulously observed prison-break film The Escapist. Following the climax on the Golden Gate the movie concludes on a note that is ambiguous in virtually every respect--moral narrative--save for advertising its desperate desire that a sequel be greenlighted. Whether or not these magnificent apes can wrest the Earth from human control will have to wait for prospective future installments. Better perhaps if theyd take over Hollywood instead.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

What about ""Rocky""?But back to the matter at hand - or paw. Since the only really good ""Planet of the Apes"" movie was the 1968 original with Charlton Heston Ive always wondered why filmmakers cant just leave well enough alone. The current foray is rationalized in those same production notes ""The film was impossible to make until the technology invented for Avatar and now advanced to a new dimension caught up to the idea behind the movie."" Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? In other words having a guy traipse around in a phony-looking monkey suit just doesnt cut it anymore. What the world has been waiting for is Andy Serkis - Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and Kong in ""King Kong"" - traipsing around via performance capture technology. He plays Caesar the supersmart chimpanzee whose education apparently does not include a single ""Planet of the Apes"" movie. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? He got his smarts because Big Pharma scientist Will Rodman (Franco) hoping to reverse the dementia of his musician father (a fine John Lithgow) has developed a virus that might restore damaged human brain tissue. Caesar is the offspring of one of Wills simian experimental subjects whose violent rampaging causes the trials to be shut down. Will does the only sensible thing - he takes orphan baby Caesar home to live with him and his dad. (By the way this movie would work very well on a double bill with ""Project Nim"" the recent documentary about the homeschooled chimp. Chimps seem to be all the rage now. Is it because so many of the humans in movies these days act like monkeys anyway? Might as well opt for the real deal.)Franco isnt very convincing as a brooding scientist - he might have benefited from some performance capture technology or at least better dialogue. (The screenwriters are Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa.) This is the kind of movie where the characters are always saying things like ""What are you saying?"" Plot points are continually reiterated. Obviously director Rupert Wyatt doesnt think we in the audience are as smart as Caesar. It all comes to a head when Caesar leads an ape revolt that spills out onto the Golden Gate Bridge. I thought there might be a ""Kong""-like moment when Caesar declares his love for the comely primatologist played by Freida Pinto but no such luck. Instead were left hanging in that twilight zone where fade-out morphs into sequel. Thanks but Ive already passed on this ""Apes"" series the first time around. Grade C- (Rated PG-13 for violence terror some sexuality and brief strong language.)

"Rise of the Planet of the Apes review Fine effects arent enough |       NJ.com comments Rise of the Planet of the Apes review Fine effects arent enough Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 05 2011 at 802 AM View/Post Comments Twentieth Century FoxModern technology enabled the makers of aRise of the Planet of the Apesa to create amazingly lifelike CGI chimpanzees. Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" isnt a bad movie -- it has one surprisingly fine performance and its action sequences are excellent -- but it seems to have been made by people who dont really like the original ""Planet of the Apes."" Or dont understand it. If you dont know the original story -- well then you shouldnt be reading this. Go off and get the DVD now. Watch it and exult in the marvelous set design the atonal Jerry Goldsmith score and Charlton Heston in all his clenched-jaw glory. But if you know that film you know that its entire point is that man is the villain. We are the animals (as Dr. Zaius points out) who foul our own nests and kill our brothers. We are the ones who have destroyed this world and lost our right to dominion over its animals. In the new film though disaster comes because man is a creature of empathy working on a cure for Alzheimers. Except it turns out to be fatal to humans; the only animal it helps (too much) is the ape. So the villain in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is -- well who? Sure theres an evil big-pharm guy who sees dollar signs in those patents. But the main character is a scientist whos only trying to ease suffering. There is no real villain and no moral. Theres just a sci-fi movie with some neat effects. Actually the effects are extraordinary. Andy Serkis who has made a career out of motion-capture work (his is the face beneath the CGI visages of Peter Jacksons Gollum and King Kong) is marvelous as Caesar the IQ-assisted chimp. Hes the one creating the wounded feelings behind that software -- and hes wonderful. Less wonderful are his fully human co-stars. James Franco no matter how many degrees he amasses in real life will never convince as a brilliant research scientist. And Freida Pinto plays one of those movie girlfriends who seems to be there simply to prove that the hero isnt gay. The script at its worst stoops to having her pause before a cataclysmic battle give Franco a kiss and whisper ""Be careful."" If you have popcorn you may want to throw it. The scene that follows is quite good as the apes take over the Golden Gate Bridge. All the action scenes are good in fact from the initial capture of the chimps to their final breakout from a primate center. (The movie plays a little bit like ""Project Nim The Revenge."") What isnt here are any of the joys of the classic film. Of course those joys faded over the years; by the time of the finale ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes"" the budget had sunk to TV-movie levels. And the first remake -- the Tim Burton ""Planet of the Apes"" from 2001 -- didnt cry out for sequels. So Fox -- which has always been particularly determined when it comes to its franchises -- has begun again. And you can guess how it will go. The next film will show humans dying en masse a scientist looking for a cure and the apes gaining strength. The third will have a final battle that leaves the apes triumphant but over a shattered Earth. Theres no mystery as to how any of this new series will play out. The only question is -- wholl actually want to see it? Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Rise of the Planet of the Apes (PG-13) Fox (105 min.) Directed by Rupert Wyatt. With James Franco Freida Pinto. Now playing in New Jersey.

(AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox Joe Lederer) WETA Digital In this image released by Twentieth Century Fox Caesar the chimp a CG animal portrayed by Andy Serkis and James Franco are shown in a scene from ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes ."" (AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox) The 800-pound gorilla in any discussion of ""Planet of the Apes"" is racism. The original movie was a classic role reversal in which a privileged white American astronaut found himself treated like a slave by ""damn dirty apes."" The origin story ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" makes the metaphor more overt as ostensibly inferior beings revolt against their masters.Its faint praise to say that this is the best of the ""Planet of the Apes"" movies because the evolution of special effects and makeup was predictable. But the unexpected strength of the film is its heart.In modern San Francisco chemist Will Rodman (James Franco) is working on a cure for Alzheimers disease which has hobbled his musician father (John Lithgow). A new serum seems to enhance brain cells in laboratory chimpanzees but when one of them goes on a violent rampage to protect the newborn baby shes been hiding lab boss Steven Jacobs (David Oyelowo) shutters the project and Will smuggles the baby chimp to his home. Unauthorized injections of the drug work wonders on the curious chimp that Will dubs Caesar (performance-captured by Andy Serkis who modeled Gollum for ""The Lord of the Rings""). The serum also seems to cure Wills father but as in ""Flowers for Algernon"" the intelligence boost in humans is temporary and after Caesar springs to the defense of the faltering old man the chimp is imprisoned in a primate center supervised by John Landon (Brian Cox) but controlled by his sadistic son Dodge (Tom Felton who played Draco Malfoy in the ""Harry Potter"" movies).Once wimpy Will and his extraneous girlfriend (Freida Pinto) are pushed out of the picture the movie rises. Caesar gets his mitts on a batch of the serum and doses the other inmates. After a vivid dramatization of the primate pecking order supersmart Caesar leads a ""Spartacus""-style slave revolt. The final third of the flick is a fantastic creature feature as a rainbow coalition of mighty apes goes bananas on the bourgeoisie. Actually ""Rise of the Plant of the Apes"" is not nearly as campy as it could have been. There are some nods to the original film but not much overt humor or social observation. Its a character-driven drama with Caesar seizing the day.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 05 2011 1201AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Way back in 1968 that famous last shot from Planet of the Apes - the Statue of Liberty reduced to a historic ruin - hinted at the unholy mess that led to the simians taking charge of the human zoo. Since then several sequels have pressed the yarn forward always lamely but no one has thought to move it back to trace the implication of that final shot. Until now. In this image released by Twentieth Century Fox Caesar the chimp a CG animal portrayed by Andy Serkis and James Franco are shown in a scene from ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes ."" The prequel ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes "" opening in U.S. theaters Friday features chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans crafted through performance-capture. Twentieth Century Fox/AP video Video Planet of the Apes rises at box office Multimedia Rise of the Planet of the Apes the official trailer Cast members James Franco and Freida Pinto pose at the premiere of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" at the Graumans Chinese theatre in Hollywood California July 28 2011. Mario Anzuoni/AP video Video Rise of the Planet of the Apes premiere Welcome to the prequel along with some happy news. Hollywood has shown a relatively deft touch with ""origin stories"" and this is no exception. The running time is efficient the direction is clean the story is simple but resonant the effects are understated yet impressive and the near-wordless star of the show puts on an acting clinic. Damned if the risen one doesnt lift us out of our seats. Opening with a stark close-up of an apes expressive eyes the movie is quick to suggest its dominant point of view. But cleverly enough that perspective takes a while to settle in. Instead early on we seem to be in the familiar territory of the misguided scientist guilty as ever of hubris as he strives to mess with the natural order. Will (James Franco) has isolated a ""benign virus"" that by restoring damaged brain cells could be a cure for Alzheimers disease - the very ailment afflicting his once-dear and now-dotty dad (John Lithgow). The drug is sure working wonders on Bright Eyes the smartest ape in the lab until ... oops those are some nastily aggressive side effects. The project is killed along with the animals but wouldnt you just know it Seems Bright Eyes had a baby. Of course Will furtively adopts the tyke whom he lovingly raises in the confines of his San Francisco home after giving him the rather prophetic name of Caesar. Yep expect repercussions. So far this is stock stuff. But the genre begins a subtle shift from mad scientist into more sociological terrain a tale of the noble savage trapped between competing cultures. Maturing into a brilliantly precocious teen capable of communicating in signs and comprehending speech Caesar is the wild child civilized yet confused. Hes trapped in a kind of no-apes land neither pet nor child no longer animal yet not quite human. This is where Andy Serkis with his ""performance capture"" wedded to the CGI effects begins his silent tour de force - the perplexed Caesar is quite touching. Then the narrative plates shift again. When Caesar too vigorously defends his ""grandpa"" from an obnoxious neighbour the authorities pack him off to the Primate Control Centre - essentially a jail where he is caged with all those lesser apes. Neatly that tale of the wild child in civilization gets stood on its head - now the imprisoned Caesar is the civilized man in the jungle and finding that his superior intelligence is no match either for the violent strength of his fellow creatures or the cruel bigotry of the keepers. Another shift. Cue The Great Escape as Caesar re-acculturates to his new surroundings learning from the brutes even while teaching them. To a ""circus orangutan"" with a rudimentary schooling in signs he exchanges this morsel of wisdom ""Apes alone weak apes together strong."" Well goodbye evolution hello revolution and on to the final genre transition when the sociological gives way to the political The masses breaking out of their shackles to answer the cry of freedom. So through its several changes the movie evolves right along with the apes and director Rupert Wyatt handles it all in a straightforward no-nonsense style - never elegant but always to the point. On screen almost continually his lead actor is a huge help. Serkiss facial expressions are themselves a study in metamorphosis and a veritable plot summary eliding from trust to confusion to fear to sorrow to anger to resolve. Its quite the star turn. En route some fun can be had playing spot the homage to the original picture - theyre embedded throughout. Even the trite location of the climax atop the Golden Gate Bridge works out fairly well. After all those giant girders and spans make for a perfect jungle gym. Advantage primates. And dont leave before the credits. Their rolling is interrupted by a very brief scene that not only adds crucial info but also doubles as the movie-in-miniature - it too is quick its simple and it says a lot without speaking a word.

Photo AP They probably should have called it ""Beneath the Dignity of the Planet of the Apes"" but ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is tolerable if youll just keep in mind that the original feature was an overachieving B-movie. In this origins story James Francos career evolves in reverse (last year he was in ""127 Hours;"" call this one ""27 IQ"") as he plays a San Francisco researcher searching for a cure for Alzheimers which afflicts his dad (John Lithgow). Not only does his ""112 virus"" cure the degenerative disease but it also supercharges normal brains. After a misunderstanding about the virus effects at the lab while testing it on chimps though the boss Jacobs (David Oyelowo) demands that Will (Franco) stop using the stuff. Instead Will takes home a super-intelligent baby chimp names him Caesar and uses his superior mental gifts exactly the way I would to hit on Freida Pinto. (Shes the ""Slumdog Millionaire"" girl and as a vet who treats Caesar she gets to spend the movie doing nothing except standing next to Franco looking like Freida Pinto which ought to be enough but somehow isnt. Three years from Best Picture to Best Human Scenery? Depressing.) Caesar who is 3 when the couple meets grows to be as big as a man by age 8. During this five-year-period it apparently never occurs to the girl to ask ""Will how is it that we came to be living with a chimp who could give Stephen Hawking some tutoring?"" Nor do the neighbors file complaint even though one of them has already had a scary encounter with the beast. Nor does Will tell his boss that the 112 virus has fully cured his dads Alzheimers and that consequently the firm has the rights to the worlds most valuable drug. Meanwhile the boss -- who is meant to be a villain but is as boring as a week at the DMV -- suddenly changes from being overly cautious about drug testing to absurdly careless. When Caesar nearly kills a neighbor though hes off to the local animal shelter where the chief (Brian Cox) tells Will that the chimp will be kept in a bucolic wonderland. Instead Caesar is shoved in a fetid cage and teased by a nasty guard (Tom Felton a k a Draco Malfoy) who doesnt know who hes dealing with and has ""first victim"" written all over him. Yet it takes the movie a good 45 minutes to catch up to the audience. During that time we are treated to endless scenes of Caesar in his cage Caesar getting into scraps with other apes and Caesar distributing chocolate chip cookies to other beasts. Come on guys pick up the pace I paid for hairy mayhem not Chips Ahoy. Why the guard -- a twerp who looks like your average Kinkos employee not a sadist whose brutality is responsible for changing the fate of the Earth -- gets so much screen time is a mystery. Especially when the movies got the ably villainous Brian Cox who once played Hannibal Lecter sitting around nearby. And neither Felton nor anybody else should ever say ""Get your paw off me you damn dirty ape"" with a straight face. At least no actor whose name doesnt rhyme with Harlton Cheston. Caesar and the other apes in captivity are surly maladjusted vaguely Marxist and forever trying to organize themselves -- theyre a lot like graduate students -- but when they finally pull together you can almost forgive the dullness of everything thats come before. At last the primates run amok in San Francisco and roar over the Golden Gate Bridge while behind them guns are blazing helicopters are whirling and Will is wandering into the spray of bullets asking if anybodys seen his lost buddy. (Pintos line during the pandemonium ""Be careful."") The monkeys dont seem to want anything except to live in the redwood forest and maybe an apology for the 1976 version of ""King Kong."" But as they settle down and establish themselves as the alpha species I couldnt quite summon much terror. Could they really be any worse than the real-life government of the state of California? kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Starr report Read Next Starr report Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46507 How Hillary blew her big moment 22547 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 19791 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Starring James Franco Freida Pinto Director Rupert Wyatt Release Opened Aug 5 2011  Editorial Review The humans play second bananasBy Michael OSullivanFriday Aug 05 2011First the good news. ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" the much-anticipated prequel to the sci-fi movie franchise of the late 60s and early 70s about a world ruled by apes gets one thing exactly right. The apes which we see on the cusp of world domination are both terrifying and sympathetic. Thats not an easy trick. Yet its critical to this origin story which charts the ascent of a hyper-intelligent chimp named Caesar (Andy Serkis in motion-capture CGI) to the role of leader of an ape underground after suffering abuse at the hands of a sadistic handler at a primate shelter (Tom Felton). As rendered by computer animators instead of actors in makeup Caesar and his simian followers are both relatable and scary as heck. Now for the bad news. The filmmakers seem to have spent so much attention and presumably money on getting the primates right that they completely forgot about the people. Led by a mumble-mouthed James Franco (see also Oscar-hosting performance) in the role of Will Rodman a research scientist whose experimental Alzheimers cure leads to a sudden jump in one young lab chimps IQ the cast of human actors is uniformly weak. John Lithgow is especially embarrassing as Wills dodderingly senile father but the list of offenders - and their acting offenses - is long. At one end of the dramatic spectrum is Freida Pinto whos almost invisible as Wills veterinarian girlfriend. At the other end theres David Oyelowo who chews the scenery and spits it out as Wills money-grubbing pharmaceutical-company boss. Brian Cox is somewhere in between. As the director of the animal shelter where the apes foment their revolution after Caesar is sent there for attacking a human Cox exudes smarmily sinister incompetence but little else. As for Felton his characters malevolence is even more over the top than the actors work in the ""Harry Potter"" movies where he played the maleficent Draco Malfoy. Heres a movie mixing live action and CGI in which the humans are the least interesting thing about it. Not to mention the least plausible. While the film succeeds in making those apes frightening - and believably emotive at least in a way that their flesh-and-blood counterparts are not - theyre less than fully present. As often happens with CGI they come frighteningly close to being just right. But the nearer they get to it the more were aware that theyre not quite there. The hair the eyes the skin the facial expressions Its all uncanny but it misses the mark by millimeters. Roddy McDowell - Serkiss 1968 predecessor - was paradoxically more real even in his stiff rubber mask. So for that matter was Helena Bonham Carter in her more technically sophisticated 2001 makeup. As for the story itself its adequately well told and by ""Planet of the Apes"" standards plausible. The action is thrilling at times especially in a climactic confrontation that takes place between the apes and the humans on the Golden Gate Bridge whose cables and girders provide a frenzied army of orangutans chimps and gorillas a setting for a beautifully choreographed battle royal. Recent news developments in the world of troubled chimp-human relations - notably the ""Project Nim"" documentary and the 2009 mauling of a woman by a pet chimp - also lend the film a shiver of contemporary verisimilitude. There are of course a few nods to the old series along the way. You didnt think you would get through this without someone saying ""Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape"" did you? Hearing that line again is fun but its also an unfortunate reminder that ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" is far from a classic.Contains some intense violence and scary scenes of apes going berserk.

The chimps gorillas and orangutans of the new Rise of the Planet of the Apes dont just move like the real deal; their faces flash with flickers of emotion and thought which is of course the menace they ultimately pose. Conjured through the ever-expanding magic of performance-capture technology the apes are easily the most compelling elements of Apes.Oddly enough Rise has less in common with the five original Apes movies or the unfortunate 2001 Tim Burton remake than with a fine new documentary. In Project Nim a razor-sharp chimp endures a tragic arc as a series of clueless humans (and a couple of responsible caregivers) try to teach him how to sign and live as a domesticated animal. Confused and abused the chimp emerges as the noblest figure of the bunch.Think of Rise of the Planet of the Apes as Nims Revenge. A well-meaning San Francisco research scientist (James Franco shining as the movies only interesting human specimen) is in search of an Alzheimers cure. He adopts a baby chimp destined for laboratory death; the chimps late mother named Bright Eyes in one of many strained nods to the original Apes was Research Exhibit A and has passed on her advanced intelligence to little Caesar. Soon Caesar is a sullen teen with a bad identity crisis; like Nim hes also too big and unpredictable for mixed company.Andy Serkis the go-to performance-capture actor featured in Peter Jacksons Lord of the Rings and King Kong ventures gives Caesar an emotional fluidity that somehow feels more than human. When Caesar enters a sort of primate prison overseen by a couple of straw-man bullies (Brian Cox and Tom Felton) he starts scheming with his fellow inmates. These mute richly developed characters make for the movies most thrilling scenes From the moment Caesar starts signing with the orangutan across the way you know the inevitable prison break is right around the corner. Most movie humans would be lucky to have these levels of pathos.Directed by Rupert Wyatt Rise of the Planet of the Apes handles its exposition-heavy task with enough dexterity to make a few plot implausibilities forgivable. Remember the original Apes handled the origins question with a climactic shot of the Statue of Liberty buried in sand (""You maniacs""). Rise has to fill in the details miracle drugs a subsequent contagion outbreak logistics that leave a few loose ends dangling. Theres a certain realism dilemma here that Planet of the Apes never had to worry about.Theres also the tiresome summer-action necessity of finishing things off with an overlong combat sequence this one set on the Golden Gate Bridge. Wyatt atones elsewhere particularly in the sequences set in Muir Woods National Monument. Its a natural special effect all towering redwoods and shafts of sunlight which speaks for a paradise soon to be lost. The danger on this Planet isnt nature red in tooth and claw. Its the humans compelled to monkey around with the lives of ancestors.Rise of the Planet of the ApesB+ Starring James Franco Freida Pinto Andy Serkis John Lithgow Brian Cox Tom Felton and David Oyelowo.

Photo WETA Digital 20th Century Fox Rise of the Planet of the Apes review 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Rise of the Planet of the Apes Science fiction. Starring James Franco and Andy Serkis. Directed by Rupert Wyatt. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Twice over the course of the movie ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" makes a reference to the original ""Planet of the Apes"" which was a sensation in 1968 and is still familiar enough for audiences today to get the joke. That original film occupies a small but unassailable place in the collective imagination and it doesnt matter that every remake and spin-off since has been unwatchable forgettable or both. The ""Damned dirty ape"" line will always get a laugh - and not only because we recognize it or because Charlton Heston was one of the great over-actors. We laugh because we remember and appreciate that degree of intensity the pristine outrage in the midst of extremity that makes a moment last over 40 years. Nothing in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" will last 40 years. If it lasts 40 days in theaters that would be amazing. It is not what could be fairly called a bad movie but neither is it fine enough to be a good one with its lineup of dull characters and a limp story that functions like a conveyor belt. Viewers get on know where its heading and thats where it goes. Yes it goes somewhere but there are no surprises. Related Stories Mediocre Rise is no top banana Review Rise of the Planet of the Apes ""Rise"" needed two or three great plot ideas. Instead it has one James Franco looking only slightly less stoned than he did at the Oscars plays a brilliant medical researcher who develops an Alzheimers drug that he is testing on chimpanzees and oh boy are those chimps getting intelligent. After his findings are unfairly discredited he brings a baby chimp home and raises it as his pet/son. The rest of the movie concerns the challenges facing a chimp caught between two worlds too much of an ape to fit in with people and too smart to spend his life eating bananas and scratching himself. Now if you just read that last sentence with attention you already know one big problem with this movie. Franco is not the star. He is the co-star. He plays a guy who feels a lot and cares a lot but more or less just stands around. Indeed if Franco ever runs for president of the United States this is his ""Bedtime for Bonzo"" because here he is playing second fiddle to a chimpanzee. (Even worse a motion-capture chimpanzee played by Andy Serkis.) The chimps existential angst and emerging love for his people become the storys entire focus. That focus is not entirely satisfying. This is supposed to be a ""Planet of the Apes"" movie after all and what the audience wants is for amazing things to happen and for it all to mean something in the end. Instead our attention is directed at the chimpanzees emotional life and were expected to find in that animals inner turbulence meaning in the chaos he eventually wreaks. To which one might say OK. Yes. Sure. But so what? As for the amazing things theyre diverting enough. Audiences in the San Francisco Bay Area (and others who know it well) will get a kick out of seeing familiar locations such as downtown the Golden Gate Bridge and Muir Woods alive with chimps - and to see news of it reported in The San Francisco Chronicle. Director Rupert Wyatt also benefits from the cinematography of Andrew Lesnie who brings a painters understanding of natural light and color to scenes that have no right to be beautiful but are as in the long shot of chimps swinging through two rows of trees down a suburban street. But mainly this intermittently entertaining but often dull movie becomes an occasion to do something you maybe havent gotten around to yet but ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" will inspire you. That is to miss Charlton Heston. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

By Joe Morgenstern August 5 2011 ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" traces the roots of the venerable franchise back to a single resident of contemporary San Francisco a supersmart simian named Caesar. In the process the film which Rupert Wyatt directed from an audacious screenplay by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver rises above its dramatic deficits boosts the collective IQ of this summers movies and swings into flights of kinetic fantasy that blow the collective mind. (If you think youve had it with special effects wait till you see Caesar and his ape army battling our befuddled species on the Golden Gate Bridge.) ENLARGE The chimpanzee Caesar leads an army in Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Twentieth Century Fox The story takes a while though an intriguing while to hit its stride. James Franco is Will Rodman a hard-charging scientist trying to find a cure for Alzheimers. The drug he comes up with seems to do the trick and then some--for his father Charles (an affecting performance by John Lithgow) whos suffering from the disease and for a baby chimpanzee whose mother was involved disastrously in the drug trials. Charles starts playing Bach like a latter-day Glenn Gould and little Caesar as Will chooses to call him shows every sign of becoming a world-class brainiac. The drug it turns out boosts intelligence exponentially though there are complications. If there werent apes might never have risen en masse and Charlton Heston whos seen in a fleeting clip on TV might have found litter on the beach instead of the Statue of Liberty. This is a Frankenstein myth for our time set at first in the gleaming laboratories of a large pharmaceutical corporation. Surprisingly though its also a family saga thats funny and intense as well as refreshingly irony-free. Will becomes the loving parent Caesar lost not to mention the cause of all sorts of grief to both species while Caesar becomes the hero of a movie that truly is about a chimp struggling to grow into the fullness of his powers. Just as the action sequences couldnt have been done without digital technology the heros nuanced characterization couldnt have been achieved without a motion-capture performance by Andy Serkis who manages wordlessly--well almost--to render unto Caesar almost as wide a range of feelings as he revealed with the help of words when he played the madly malign little Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings."" A good thing too because Wills range seems narrower notwithstanding Mr. Francos efforts and most of the other human characters are stick figures clothed in zestful cliches. Freida Pinto doesnt even get to do zest as Caroline a primatologist who falls in love with Will or maybe with Will and Caesar alike. Her role consists mainly of issuing warnings. ""This is wrong Will"" she says at one point. ""Youre trying to control things that dont want to be controlled."" And later ""There are some things that cant be changed."" Ill issue a mild warning of my own--dont judge the film on neatness. The plot keeps jumping chimplike between San Francisco and a preposterously huge primate shelter in nearby San Bruno with a lyrical interlude in Marin Countys redwood forest. The script is unconcerned with what Will and Caroline do when Caesar isnt looking and Will seems oblivious for the longest time to the question of finding a habitat for Caesar thats more suitable than a converted attic. Judged though as the action extravaganza it means to be ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" wins high marks for originality and takes top honors for spectacle. (The senior visual effects supervisor was Joe Letteri who won four Oscars for his work on ""Avatar"" ""The Lord of the Rings"" films and ""King Kong."" Andrew Lesnie was the cinematographer.) Its not just how many apes fill the screen--zombie movies marshal digital hordes as a matter of course--but what they do as a phalanx led by Caesar and as astonishingly specific individuals. The primate shelter becomes the scene of an epic jailbreak. Swarming chimps turn San Francisco into a surreal circus. The opposing forces on the bridge could be Cossacks (our side) versus revolutionaries with a superhuman--all right nonhuman--gift for martial acrobatics. The film was shot in two dimensions with no need of a third and comes and goes in not much more than an hour and a half if you subtract the extremely long closing credits. Thats revolutionary too a summer spectacular both thrilling and brief. The Change-Up Watch a clip from from ""The Change-Up"" starring Jason Bateman Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde. ENLARGE Jason Bateman and Leslie Mann in The Change-Up. Universal Studios Lets give this ghastly studio comedy a Truthiness in Advertising award if nothing else. In the movie Jason Batemans earnest lawyer and family man Dave gets a faceful of feces while changing a diaper. The trailers dont fully capture the moment but at least they suggest it with a quick cut to a brown smudge that should serve as a vulgarity alert. Or for the target audience a vulgarity guarantee since thats what the production is peddling and what it delivers. The pretext is a shopworn plot in which Dave and his best friend Mitch a heedless hedonist played by Ryan Reynolds magically switch bodies. The transfer occurs when the two men talk about envying each others lives while relieving themselves in a public fountain. This leads to reasonably clever situations every now and then--both actors do their best with hollow roles--and to some insight into how Dave and Mitch are seen by others. But the main attraction is how far the film will go in grossing us out and it goes so far that you may quickly identify with Daves baby son who keeps banging his head against the side of his crib. (Thats supposed to be funny like every other dumb and offensive thing in the movie including two ways to spoil sex with beautiful women.) The director was David Dobkin who did a raunchy and genuinely funny movie called ""Wedding Crashers"" six years ago. He worked from a script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore; they wrote the hilarious ""The Hangover"" two years ago. Olivia Wilde is Sabrina an alluring law associate. Leslie Mann suffers in more ways than one as Jamie Daves wife. Talented people all and either prisoners of the studio system which will do anything it takes to reach an audience or willing players in a soiled playpen. The Whistle Blower Watch a clip from ""The Whistleblower"" about a Nebraska cop played by Rachel Weisz who outed the U.N. for covering up a sex scandal. Ive watched with fascination and dismay as Rachel Weisz and the woman she plays Kathy Bolkovac have hit the talk-show circuit on behalf of this film about sex traffickers in wartime Bosnia. Fascination because both women are so intelligent and articulate and the story they describe is so compelling but also dismay because the screen version is so clumsily didactic and flat. Ms. Bolkovac was a police officer in Nebraska when she signed a lucrative contract to become a peacekeeper with the United Nations. Unfortunately for her the arrangement made her an employee of a U.N. contractor rather than a U.N. functionary with appropriate power and international agencies along with local cops proved to be complicit in the prostitution rings she endeavored to break up. Unfortunately for the film which describes itself as having been inspired by actual events the first-time director Larysa Kondracki and her screenplay collaborator Eilis Kirwan took their most obvious inspiration from the tricks and tropes of other films. Ms. Weisz is always a strong presence but her talents are wasted here on a naive heroine--the fictional Kathy is exceedingly slow to grasp the extent of the corruption--and a narrative style that turns the horror of the prostitutes plight into harrowing melodrama. Vanessa Redgrave is a spectral presence in the strangely truncated role of Kathys mentor. Bellflower Watch a clip from ""Bellflower"" a film about two friends who spend all their free time building flame-throwers and weapons of mass destruction in hopes that a global apocalypse will occur and clear the runway for their imaginary gang ""Mother Medusa"". A daring feature debut by Evan Glodell ""Bellflower"" looks like it was shot with the digital equivalent of a Brownie box camera and generates an almost palpable aura of anxiety. In addition to directing from his own screenplay Mr. Glodell portrays Woodrow an eerily cheerful young man who with his buddy Aiden (Tyler Dawson) plays at preparing for the apocalypse popularized by Mel Gibsons ""Mad Max."" Woodrow and Aiden arent mad in any literal sense of the word theyre simply obsessed by the scruffy mythology to the point of building their own flamethrower and modifying an old muscle car so that flames bellow forth from its stacks. Then playtime turns sinister and violent. While the flames may be an expression of repressed sexuality the movie as a whole is anything but pat. Its a dark vision neither readily described nor dismissed of friends with no stable selves living bleak lives that make no sense. DVD FOCUS Monkey Business (1931) ENLARGE The Marx Brothers of course in one of their funniest comedies. Groucho Harpo Chico and Zeppo are stowaways on an ocean liner. Theres no plot to speak of only steady-state chaos that involves among many other things rival gangsters and the brothers efforts to avoid the captain and crew. The cast includes Thelma Todd and Tom Kennedy. This was the first Marx Brothers film to be written for the screen (by S.J. Perelman of The New Yorker magazine fame Will B. Johnstone and Arthur Sheekman). The director was Norman Z. McLeod. Charly (1968) Cliff Robertson won an Oscar for his role as the mentally challenged Charly Gordon who thanks to experimental surgery becomes a genius with an IQ thats off the charts. The productions mawkishness is off the charts too. No one tells the hero that the loftiness of his intellect wont last and the movie milks the cheesy tragedy for all its worth. Claire Bloom is Charlys teacher. The cast includes Lilia Skala Ruth White and Dick Van Patten. Ravi Shankar did the music. Ralph Nelson directed from Stirling Silliphants adaptation of ""Flowers for Algernon"" a short story by Daniel Keyes. Swept From the Sea (1997) Rachel Weisz is Amy a pagan water spirit and radiant outcast in Beeban Kidrons romantic fantasy based loosely on a Joseph Conrad short story. Amy exults in pelting rain (her lipstick survives some of the worst weather since ""Wuthering Heights"") and hides humble treasures from the sea in her own secret grotto. Vincent Perez is the hot-eyed Yanko an outcast too and the seas greatest gift to Amy. Sometimes ""Swept From the Sea"" teeters on the brink of self-parody. Yet the film has the courage of its florid convictions. It sweeps you up and carries you away.
