Fearing an invasion of post-Columbus proportions the locals call on arrogant General Crawl to amass his anti-alien brigade. Only one character a kid called Lom  is prepared to help Chuck evade capture. Planet 51 posits notions of colonialism cultural division and xenophobia to unremarkable effect. Its also one hell of a magpie movie  - thats to say it comes over as a mix of ideas characters designs and scenes that recall Shrek (hardly surprising given that the film is penned by Shrek writer Joe Stillman) The Cat in the Hat Toy Story Alien Star Wars and ET. This below-par sci-fi animation is no threat to the similarly themed and infinitely superior Battle for Terra (released February 12) but theres enough of a storyline here to keep younger space cadets moderately settled.

Only if youre on Planet Denial Updated  | Review  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Ilion Animation Studio Sony Pictures Friend of the Earthling Lem (Justin Long) helps Chuck. By Claudia Puig USA TODAY When the computer-animated space adventure Planet 51 resorts to silly bathroom humor just 15 minutes after the opening credits we know were in for a sorry experience. The idea had promise The story is set on a distant planet populated by conventional-thinking beings that act a lot like Americans in the late 50s. They may be the color of split-pea soup and sport antennae but philosophically theyre a lot like the folks in Leave It to Beaver. While the Cold War era with its rampant paranoia was an ideal setting for ""B"" movies about alien invasions this insipid and disjointed comedy features an odd mashup of disparate time periods. The music of the 50s exists alongside the hippie ethos of the 60s and their hovering spacecrafts borrow liberally from Woodies to classic Cadillacs to VW vans with psychedelic insignias. References to Star Wars E.T. and Alien might resonate with some of the young audience. 2001 A Space Odyssey allusions could go right over their heads. But whose idea was it to include a Singin in the Rain homage? Into this world crash-lands Capt. Chuck Baker (Dwayne Johnson) a carrot-topped astronaut who is an insult to everyone who ever ventured to outer space including the chimps. Hes a cross between Beauty and the Beasts lame-brained Gaston and The Mary Tyler Moore Shows smarmy Ted Baxter. Hes eager to get back to Earth for the Kids Choice Awards so he can get slimed. Of course this is a bald bid for youthful laughs but its not very funny. Chuck brags about having ""the right stuff"" and is jealous of John Glenn. Why the filmmakers chose to make an ostensibly brave explorer such a moronic doofus is mystifying. Chuck turns to Lem (Justin Long) to help him return to Earth. Strangely neither the astronaut nor Lem an astronomy buff shows any interest or curiosity in each others worlds. The planets armed forces come out in full force. Forced mayhem and uninteresting frenzy ensues. Joe Stillman who wrote the witty and endearing Shrek and Shrek 2 is credited as co-writer. Perhaps others got in and mucked about with the screenplay. This has the directionless recycled feel of a script by committee. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Hes speaking about the amphibianesque creatures on Planet 51 which resembles a cartoon version of the Happy Days set with bulbous cars streamlined diners and a dim-witted populace enamored of scary alien invasion movies.An uninspired computer-animated feature that may satisfy undiscriminating pipsqueaks and nearly no one else Planet 51 is a low-IQ E.T. in reverse with the human visitor a square-jawed American spaceman by the name of Charles ""Chuck"" Baker (the voice of Dwayne Johnson) befriended by a green-skinned antenna-topped kid. When the Earthlings presence becomes known the army and the masses go into a panic.Notable for its rip-offs (generous souls can call them homages) of (and to) WALL-E 2001 A Space Odyssey Star Wars The Day the Earth Stood Still Alien The Terminator and Grease this soulless exercise in kiddie entertainment also boasts the larynxes of Justin Long (as the teen hero Lem) Jessica Biel (his next-door neighbor and crush-object Neera) Gary Oldman (a pompous general) and John Cleese (a monocle-sporting professor).Like humans convinced that the end is nigh and that aliens - or Roland Emmerich - are about to wreak apocalyptic havoc the Planet 51ers wander around in dread of an invasion of UFOs. So when the way-off-his-trajectory Capt. Baker lands loud and pointless freakouts ensue. There are chases there are shoot-outs there are misunderstandings and missed opportunities for reconciliation.There are opportunities aplenty too to use the rest room and concession stands.Written by a Shrek contributor (Joe Stillman) and directed by Jorge Blanco working with his Madrid-based Ilion Animation Studios team Planet 51 has a bright color palette and next to no distinguishing features. The weirdest design element is the ""hair"" on the creatures heads Between their antennae sprout thick green-yellow clumps that look like little bananas.Planet 51 home of the plantain-heads.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Not only are the emerald-colored extraterrestrials in ""Planet 51 terrified by the appearance of a human astronaut on their home turf theyre imprisoned in a cruddy reductive version of ""Happy Days and forced to spout inane dialogue. Young children and adults with high pain thresholds will enjoy the movie during its brief pause on the way to your On Demand menu.The planet of the title is home to a complacent race of noseless humanoids who speak English and whose culture has made it up to the ""Grease era of drive-in restaurants and cheesy sci-fi invasion movies.

Hes taken in by teenage misfit Lem (Justin Long) who hides him from a warlike general (Gary Oldman) and a mad scientist (John Cleese) after the humans brain.""Planet 51 is a cargo-cult movie - a piece of pop-culture flotsam that exists by scavenging pieces of other better films. The astronaut has a pet robot that should fascinate Pixars lawyers Its an uncanny fusion of WALL-E and Eve. Theres the expected visual call-out to ""E.T. (silhouettes against the moon) and pet dogs that are peppy pint-size versions of the beast in ""Alien (the best gag in the movie). As a whole ""Planet 51 plays like a debased inversion of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still the 1951 original of which is still probably the best first sci-fi movie for kids.This telling is fast shiny short and cheerful and it does give small minds some cultural relativism along with their popcorn. (Wait who are the aliens here?) Its also obnoxiously written with too many cutesy-dirty double-entendres that are meant to appeal to the grown-ups but that only make the movie seem cringingly infantile. Screenwriter Joe Stillman worked on the first two ""Shrek movies but his more telling credit may be ""Beavis and Butt-head Do America.""Planet 51 is most interesting as an attempt by the Spanish CGI company Ilion Animation to bootstrap its way into the big leagues by hiring Hollywood talent to write the script and perform the roles. The actors are all perfectly adequate (though Id love to know what went through Cleeses head) but no one at Pixar or DreamWorks Animation will lose sleep after seeing the brightly cluttered visuals here.

(Emilio Pereda/Paola Ardizzoni) BY Joe Neumaier Elizabeth Weitzman DAILY NEWS MOVIE CRITICS Thursday November 19 2009 634 PM Broken Embraces3 starsA director remembers his great love. At the Sunshine Lincoln Plaza (207). R sexuality language drugs. In Spanish with subtitles.Pedro Almodovars latest is perfectly titled its a big swoony kiss that doesnt quite connect with the passion he intends. But fans of the Spanish auteur--or his muse Penelope Cruz--will find plenty to love. This heady mix of melodrama mystery and dark comedy concerns itself mostly with the past when director Harry Caine (Lluis Homar) fell for his leading lady (Cruz) incurring the wrath of her lover (Jose Luis Gomez). Their affair spun out into a web that has entangled everyone since leaving Harry a broken man emotionally and physically.The notable lack of chemistry between Cruz and Homar is a crucial absence in a film about all-consuming romance. And though each part is great fun to watch the whole feels unfinished. Still Almodovars delirious love for movies remains visible in every carefully-composed frame. For cinephiles at least that shared passion will be enough. Elizabeth WeitzmanPlanet 512 starsAnimated adventures about an astronaut stuck on an alien world. With the voices of Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson Jessica Biel. (135) PG-13. At area theaters.A comic homage to 1950s sci-fi in which suburbia was invaded by spacemen this sharp-looking but unimaginative adventure hasnt the wit of similar kiddie flicks like ""Monsters Vs. Aliens."" Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson gives a muscular voice performance as an Earthling who crash-lands on a planet where hes feared and chased. A green-skinned alien (Justin Long) helps the astronaut and to return the favor the poor-mans Buzz Lightyear helps the kid win over his antennaed love (Jessica Biel). John Cleese and Gary Oldman are the scientist and the military muscle respectively. Movie references abound but theres not enough humor to fuel even 90 minutes. One example The filmmakers never even bother to explain why their alien world echoes the Eisenhower era.Joe NeumaierRed Cliff3 starsEpic about a momentous Chinese battle. With Tony Leung. Director John Woo. (228). R Violence. At the Beekman and Landmark Sunshine.After several soulless Hollywood actioners Hong Kong director John Woo (""A Better Tomorrow"" ""Hard Boiled"" ""The Killer"") widens his scope for this gripping battle epic about a massive Chinese dynastic war during the second century AD. Tony Leung is an oasis of calm as a savvy viceroy facing a feared general (Zhang Fengyi) whos trying to outthink and out-fight two rebel forces. Overlong but ambitious Woo proves hes as good at tactical maneuvers as he is at close-quarters combat. J.N.Mammoth1 starA married couple struggles with their relationship. With Michelle Williams Gael Garcia Bernal. (206) Unrated Sexuality. At the IFC Center.The overlapping stories the emotional disconnect the heavy-handed symbolism -- no its not a movie from the makers of ""Babel"" its a mumbling stammering copycat drama from Swedish director Lukas Moodysson. A wealthy SoHo couple (lovely Michelle Williams irritating Gael Garcia Bernal) long for each other as he goes to Thailand to make a videogame-business deal but finds willing sexual conquests as she suffers through her work as a surgeon. Their daughter no surprise is closer to her earthy nanny whose own son in the Philippines might as well have a target on his head. Williams can be so much better than the material here allows her to be. A mammoth shame.J.N.Staten Island2 starsThriller about a vengeful mobster. At the Village East (136). R violence language.We can appreciate James DeMonacos desire to shine a light on Staten Island which he fairly complains gets lost in Manhattans shadow. If only hed made a movie good enough to earn his overlooked borough some deserved attention. Unfortunately a clever opening promises more originality than he delivers. Though hes got a strong cast theyre wasted in silly roles like a moronic septic tank cleaner (Ethan Hawke) who robs a Staten Island mob boss (Vincent DOnofrio) and a deaf deli worker (Seymour Cassel) whose silences are naturally golden.DeMonaco deserves credit for wanting to do something different. But what starts out as a witty tweak on tired mobster movies eventually collapses into those very same cliches. E.W.

Green-skinned Lem voiced by Justin Long befriends misplaced astronaut Chuck Baker voiced by Dwayne Johnson in the animated feature ""Planet 51."" Photo COLUMBIA PICTURES  ASSOCIATED PRESS Planet 51 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Glipforg is such a nice quiet town -- straight out of the 1950s with fresh-faced teens backyard barbecues and pupils crouching under their desks during air-raid drills at school. Then again the fresh-faced teens have green skin and floppy antennae. The barbecue grill levitates meat. And the kids doing the duck-and-cover are preparing for a massive human invasion. Welcome to Planet 51 -- and Planet 51 an innocuous computerized bauble set on a distant orb where the asparagus-colored population so thoroughly brainwashed by alien-invasion movies goes into paranoiac civil-defense mode when United States astronaut Chuck Baker happens to plop his lander near a picket fence. Deplaning to the tune of Thus spake Zarathustra Chuck (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) steps on a squeeze toy and promptly wigs out. The indigenous burger-flippers wig out too. Pretty much the whole planet wigs out except for Lem (Justin Long) a nice boy who works at the local observatory and Lems buddies Skiff (Seann William Scott) and Eckle (Freddie Benedict). Meanwhile the entire Glipforg military-industrial complex is busy hunting down Captain Baker -- theyre convinced he wants to eat their brains among other things -- and frantically mobilizing for a galactic blitzkrieg. ""The battle for our world has begun"" announces General Grawl (Gary Oldman) a puff-chested hawk just begging for an interspecies smackdown. Dont worry; he gets it. Along the way Chuck Lem and their little green friends amuse themselves with references to so many science-fiction movies that it all beings to feel like the huckster room at a Star Wars convention. The films large assortment of filmmakers (director Jorge Blanco co-directors Marcos Martinez and Javier Adad screenwriter Joe Stillman) dutifully break up the action with quick lessons on friendship courage and the breadth of the universe. Johnson -- Le Rock himself -- seems to be having a gas as the misplaced astronaut proving once again why he dominates the family-comedy genre. Both the ego-flapping blowhard and the self-effacing klutz come naturally to him He makes a fine clown even in his voice work. Among his cast mates John Cleese stands out as a tiny malignant scientist but Jessica Biel sounds rightly bored as Lems politically active love interest. The movie as a whole isnt exactly ground-breaking and some of the humor tanks. But it has enough action laughs and candy-hued visuals to satisfy the target audience without plunging grown-ups into despair. My two 9-year-old companions were thoroughly entertained. I was partially entertained. Not a bad outcome all in all. One final thing pants. Except for Captain Bakers there are none. While female Glipforgians prance around in cat-eye glasses and starchy dresses the males wear nothing more than shirts. Their smooth crotches suggest an undisclosed location -- an Area 51 -- for genitalia which wouldnt merit attention in a kids flick were it not for one truly hilarious moment near the end. It involves Chuck a cotton sheet and a group of surprised trouser-less aliens and it is just blue enough for an MPAA upgrade to PG.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 19 2009 247PM EST Last updated Friday Apr. 02 2010 227AM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Planet 51 Directed by Jorge Blanco Written by Joe Stillman Starring Dwayne Johnson Justin Long Jessica Biel Classification PG ""The unknown is not something to be afraid of. The unknown can be your friend"" is the kid-friendly moral to the story of Planet 51 . Well you cant argue with the preaching but how about a little practice? With one exception everything about this animated flick seems reassuringly borrowed and thoroughly familiar and so soothingly ""known."" That makes it the filmic equivalent of the old ""Do as I say not as I do"" Daddy routine the sort of lecture that any savvy eight-year-old sees right through thereby learning a lesson as valuable as it is unintended. Little Johnny now you can define ""hypocrisy"" and even use it in a sentence. Hey welcome to the world of grown-ups. Perhaps Im just being a grown-up myself too cranky and harsh. If so its only because the above-mentioned exception - a nifty reversal of the usual scary alien premise - is bursting with potential that never gets realized. But more of that later. First we start on the distant planet in question populated by amiable green critters sporting wavy antennae and a Day-Glo society right out of fifties America. Darned if the place isnt a galactic Pleasantville - same soda shops and pop songs and cookie-cutter suburbs and paranoid provincialism. Thats not to say there arent a few indigenous differences but they dont amount to much - cars hover it rains pebbles teenagers offer each other ""high fours"" and a struggling minority of wannabe hippies wave placards reading ""Make like not war."" Okay the opening is pretty cute. Then comes the reversal The planet is invaded by an alien intruder and the enemy is us. Chuck the astronaut (the voice of Dwayne Johnson) lands his craft in someones front yard plants the Stars and Stripes beside a white picket fence and by his mere presence scares the bejabbers out of the natives at least before they get restless. Certainly a more clever writer than Joe Stillman (a Shrek alumnus) could generate some real satiric mileage from this premise adjusted for a kiddie audience but mileage nonetheless. And obviously the best animation knows how to take a split-level approach to both its humour and its themes - one story for the young another for the young-at-heart. But not here. Instead having established its fresh conceit the script simply heads off into stale territory complete with the inevitable borrowings from Spielberg and Kubrick and any number of B-movie staples from our own Eisenhower past. So as luck would have it Chuck has his first close encounter with Lem the open-minded teen (Justin Long) whereupon both alien and local discover they share a facility with the Queens English and a taste for oxygenated air. Off goes Chucks life-preserving helmet; then off goes Chuck to the kids bedroom the preferred hiding place for every E.T. Meanwhile outside in Planet 51s xenophobic climate brawny General Growl (Gary Oldman) and his Dr. Strangelove accomplice (John Cleese) have declared that ""the battle for our world has begun."" In short the chase is on although not without a side-trip or two down lovers lane. You see Chucks new friend Lem has an eye for the spunky gal with those pre-hippie habits (Jessica Biel). And Chucks old friend Rover the robot has a nose for rock samples and big trouble and any native who offers him an affectionate pat on his metallic head. A modest prediction Expect Rover to safely make the return journey to the shelves of your neighbourhood Toys R Us touching down just in time for a festive Christmas. By now with nowhere to go except toward that incongruous moral the story is getting thin on the ground obliging director Jorge Blanco to pad with the usual plush stuffing - bland action and busy edits. When the end does arrive the children of Planet 51 like children everywhere prove themselves quicker studies than their myopic parents and come to realize that in a universe as vast as the imagination differences must not be feared but appreciated. Alas watching all this back here on the third rock from the sun our poor kids may be a tad confused wondering what to believe when the message embraces variety but the messenger is the same old same old.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Planet 51 Free Video Rated PG  91 minutes  2009 In this 2009 digital animation a NASA astronaut (visually reminiscent of Toy Storys Buzz Lightyear and given voice by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) arrives on a distant planet and is dumbfounded to find it inhabited by a tiny green race of picket-fence bourgeois paranoids. Theyre meant as a parody of Americans during the Cold War but the script lacks wit and the in-joke references to cinematic sci-fi classics will soar over little kids heads without pleasing many adults.

Movie Information Planet 51RatingShowtimes | Official site | TrailerDirector Jorge BlancoActorsThe voices of Dwayne Johnson Jessica Biel Justin Long Gary Oldman and John CleeseRun time 91 minutesMPAA rating PG (mild sci-fi action and some suggestive humor)SynopsisAn astronaut lands on the titular planet sending the little green natives into a panic.More movies from GuideLive.comHow fun then and thought-provoking for kids to turn the tables in Planet 51. In this animated film an astronaut (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) is the oblivious alien planting an American flag on manicured grass not far from where the astonished little green natives are having their family backyard barbecue.Dont strain your brain with details of how the inhabitants not only speak English but are living behind the white picket fences of American suburbia in the 1950s complete with a bubble-pop soundtrack.Just take a hovercraft ride with the clever script by Joe Stillman. The Oscar-nominated scribe behind Shrek and Shrek 2 borrows imagery from Alien (for a comically vicious alien dog) and Wall-E (for a wordless American probe named Rover obsessed with collecting rocks).Green teen Lem (voiced by Justin Long) has a few difficulties Should he challenge the authorities and help the astronaut get back to his capsule? How can he win the heart of Neera (Jessica Biel) the girl next door?As mayhem inevitably ensues Stillman works in an E.T. sight gag - our astronaut aloft on an aliens bicycle in the shadow of the moon - and Singin in the Rain - Rover dancing happily around a lamppost as he discovers that it rains rocks on the planet.The plot and characterizations may be too predictable for this to become a classic but the initial twist is terrific and sci-fi fans should get a chuckle out of the title itself Its a riff on Area 51 the nickname for a mysterious military base that UFO believers have long suspected holds secret information about aliens.In another nice touch the cliche of big bad general (Gary Oldman) turns out to be well-meaning and worthy of redemption.Definitely a planet worth a visit. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Photo As fresh as the latest issue of The Saturday Evening Post ""Planet 51"" occupies the same comedy galaxy as Planet Andy Rooney. ""Singin in the Rain"" references? John Glenn? Cold War duck-and-cover drills? What time capsule yielded this script? This animated spoof of 50s alien-invasion movies takes place on a planet populated by avocado-colored critters that combine the cuddliness of your average iguana with the warmth of polyurethane. At least your kids wont be begging to go to the toy store afterward. The creatures live in a ""Back to the Future""-ish 50s-styled world in which the hovercraft look like mid-century American muscle cars and the movies are about invading alien men -- ""Humaniacs."" American astronaut Chuck Baker (Dwayne Johnson whose voice is blandness on steroids) lands on the planet offering warmed-over Buzz Lightyear shtick (posing heroically plotting wacky schemes). He takes things to inanity and beyond supplying humorless pop-culture name-checking where the jokes should be e.g. ""Do you have any frappuccino?"" and ""In space no one can hear you scream."" Watching Chuck try to amuse the aliens by quoting from ""The Right Stuff"" and ""Star Wars"" is bad enough; the quotes from ""The Terminator"" dont even make sense nor could I figure out why the movie stops to allow Chuck to boogie to a Muzaked redacted ""Greased Lightning."" Chucks mission (to get back to his spaceship within three days) keeps getting interrupted by say his giving tango lessons to a friendly alien nerd named Lem (Justin Long another vocally undistinguished actor) whos thinking about maybe someday asking out the girl next door (Jessica Biel). Their dull but chaste relationship is at least free of the weird inappropriateness of a few scenes. A buddy of Lems terrified of the human invader hands Lem a cork for self-defense in case the astronauts interested in body-cavity exploration. Later there will be a joke about a naked man and the strange place where his ""antenna"" is located. Also hanging around soaking up screen time are some hippie aliens (their hovercraft is a VW bus complete with clouds of interior smoke and guitar-strumming protesters) and Chucks dog-size robot probe which skitters around collecting rocks and failing to be as endearing as Wall-E. Led by a paranoid Dr. Mengele-like scientist (John Cleese) and an equally hostile general (Gary Oldman) the green men threaten to crack open Chucks brain and that of anyone who has been contaminated by close contact with him thus presumed to be a ""zombie."" The jokes are far too weak for adults or children at least on this planet while the satirical subtext that is the sole point of potential interest is a jumble. ""Planet 51"" at first mocks the idea that these peaceful ordinary aliens with their barbecues and picket fences are anything to fear then presents some of the little monsters as scary and violent little creeps who indeed want to do harm to anything they dont understand. Yet the moral at the end is that we should all be more tolerant of different cultures. Is that really true though if the culture youre trying to tolerate is trying to open your skull with a circular saw? kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Flop-secret Read Next Flop-secret Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 39913 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20579 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 13459 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Movie review Planet 51 with Jessica Biel Dwayne Johnson Justin Long washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Planet 51 Movie review Planet 51 with Jessica Biel Dwayne Johnson Justin Long Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 20 2009 ""Planet 51"" is cute. Cute however is a double-edged sword. The animated movie succeeds as a gently wry twist on ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" in which the ""alien"" is a human astronaut (Dwayne Johnson) who gets stuck on a planet of little green men and has to enlist the help of a plucky youngster Lem (Justin Long) to get home. But its no great beauty. Thats not just because of some unnecessarily coarse humor. Johnsons character Capt. Charles Baker uses the euphemism ""fricking"" and theres a sight gag about his er ""antenna"" when he jumps naked off an examination table. And Lems friend Skiff (Seann William Scott) proposes an unorthodox use for a champagne cork as a means of protection from the dreaded anal probe that he supposes Baker is going to use on him. Yeah. Like most little kids have even heard of that form of cultural outreach. Of course the aliens -- who like Donald Duck wear shirts but no pants -- are as squeaky clean as a Ken doll from the waist down. So the joke doesnt even make sense. Thats the thing. ""Planet 51"" wants to be a kids cartoon but its written like its for grown-ups. One of the films recurring gags is that the residents of this planet are still stuck in their version of the 1950s while Baker is from today. (The films title can be read as both a play on Area 51 and a reference to the decade in which it seems to be set.) The standard attire for Lem -- Get it? Lunar excursion module? -- is a bowling shirt. ""Cars"" are wood-paneled hovercraft. And telephones are still rotary-dial. Cute. But over the heads of most young audience members who wont know the 1950s from the 1940s. Or the 1960s for that matter. Neither apparently do the filmmakers (writer Joe Stillman and directors Jorge Blanco Javier Abad and Marcos Martinez). One of the movies characters is a long-haired hippie alien named Glar (Alan Marriott) whos protesting the militarys bellicose response to Bakers arrival. Glar a rival for the affections of Lems love interest Neera (Jessica Biel) drives around the town of Glipforg in a psychedelic-painted UFO that looks suspiciously like a VW van on the way to Woodstock. Again this makes no sense in a movie whose soundtrack features 50s hits ""Lollipop"" and ""Mr. Sandman."" But does any of this really matter? The ""E.T."" template is a safe one. At this point who hasnt seen the movie either on cable DVD or when it first came out? So ""Planet 51s"" table-turning premise -- and recycled warm fuzzies about embracing the Other -- is guaranteed to get at least a few laughs. In the end though ""Planet 51"" may bear less similarity to that 1982 movie than to a much more recent film not coincidentally also starring a funny-looking guy with green skin and antennae. Writing in the New York Times magazine about the influence of ""Shrek"" on subsequent kids movies A.O. Scott notes how that animated 2001 feature ""set the template for 21st-century family entertainment."" ""License a lot of pop songs"" he writes of the now-sure-fire formula ""lock in merchandising opportunities recruit A-list celebrities to read a script full of winking allusions and semi-rude jokes for the grown-ups and hokey morals for the kids and watch the money pour in."" ""Planet 51"" is cute but its no ""Shrek.""  1/2 PG. At area theaters. Contains sci-fi action and suggestive humor. 90 minutes.

"Planet 51 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Star WarsMOVIE REVIEW Planet 51Dwayne Johnson Jessica Biel and Justin Long cant rescue this animated tale.November 20 2009|By Glenn Whipp PLANET 51 Lem left wants to help Chuck escape. (Ilion Animation Studios...)The action in the new kids flick ""Planet 51"" takes place on an alternate-universe version of Earth where Shrek-green humanoids live out SoCal-accented happy days complete with Googie architecture white picket fences and Little Richard playing on the radio. The big news among the populace is the premiere of ""Humaniacs III"" the latest in a popular movie series about human invaders who ""eat brains for dinner."" So when American astronaut Chuck Baker (voiced by Dwayne Johnson) emerges from his lunar module humming Strauss ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" the little green people freak out fearing theyll be turned into zombies. Chuck expecting to claim a deserted planet for the U.S. of A goes into hiding too. Now all he wants to do is phone home to Mission Control and get back to where he once belonged -- although where exactly Chuck belongs is never specified. The debut of Madrid-based Ilion Animation Studios ""Planet 51"" displays an almost criminal lack of curiosity about the small details that would bring its story to life. Instead the bland humor-free narrative focuses on the efforts of nerdy humanoid teen Lem (Justin Long) to believe in himself long enough to win the girl next door (Jessica Biel) and help Chuck escape. Its a missed opportunity. The premise is OK enough even if it is like one of those old ""Star Trek"" episodes in which Kirk and crew would land on a planet whose culture was modeled on the Roman Empire or Chicagos Gangland. Instead of spinning its spoof of 1950s sci-fi paranoia in new directions the movie trades in potty humor and tired sendups of ""The Terminator"" and ""Star Wars."" If as Chuck suggests the 60s are about to take hold on Planet 51 we just hope someone writes a protest song about this movie. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement MORE STORIES ABOUTStar WarsMovieStar TrekEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-planet20-2009nov20,0,2898709.story",200,planet5114,planet51,latimes

Share Tweet Through the same mysterious alchemy that gave the moviegoing public back-to-back CGI insect adventures (A Bugs Life and Antz) deep-sea fish adventures (Finding Nemo and Shark Tale) and films about escaped zoo animals returning to nature (Madagascar and The Wild) 2009 has produced two films about peaceful alien civilizations disrupted by human invaders. The first Mays Battle For Terra was a cheaply animated but heady ponderous think-piece about the nature of humanity and the causes of war. The second the new comic adventure Planet 51 is Terras opposite in every way. Its visuals are far more sophisticated; its concepts far less so. Planet 51 makes a few brief gestures in the direction of Terras ideas but largely its a jellybean of a movie bright colorful sugary and with no real content. On a planet stuck in a kitschy version of the 50s dippy teen every-alien Lem (Justin Long) has an easygoing life until a smarmy pink biped from another planet lands a ship on his neighbors lawn and tries to claim it in the name of something called America. Since Lems society has a 50s-era obsession with sci-fi pulp entertainment the media and military completely freak out assuming human astronaut Captain Baker (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is necessarily a mind-controlling brain-devouring planet-conquering monster. When a starchy general (Gary Oldman) and a kooky mad scientist (John Cleese) attempt to capture Baker Lem grits his teeth and tries to do the right thing by helping him even though hes a dimwitted manipulative douche. The humans-are-the-aliens turnaround is amusing but theres no theme or thought to the movie just a series of soft-pedaled jokes. Screenwriter Joe Stillman worked on Shrek and Shrek 2 and he piles on the Shrek-esque sight gags without any sense that he understands anything he evokes Its fitfully funny to see atomic-age ""duck and cover"" drills space-age-paranoia movies and a protest-leading stoner hippie in an alien setting but on a world that doesnt have atomic weapons space exploration pot or Vietnam its all just shallow unimaginatively borrowed iconography. Nothing about the story goes any deeper than ""Hey remember that? Here it is again with green skin and tentacles"" Granted theyre well-animated tentacles The whole film has a beautifully soft rounded luminous design with a lot of Shrek-like attention to jokey detail. But the characters are irritatingly inconsistent--Baker in particular is by turns brave cowardly smart idiotic deluded and insightful as the weak witticism of the moment demands--and the whole film doesnt have a brain in its head. Or rather it has the colorful creative right brain to Battle For Terras dryly analytical left brain. If only the two could be squashed into a single movie thats pretty and ambitious.

Fearing the brain-eating ""humaniacs"" they see at the movies the Planet 51ers naturally view spaceman Chuck (voiced by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) as a monster--except timid green teen Lem (Justin Long) who saves Chuck from the mob ""Mom can I keep him?"" Handsome doofus Chuck is a chip off the Buzz Lightyear block but Planet 51 lacks the Pixar polish (particularly in its writing)--still its not a bad knockoff. The alternate-reality Cold War-era design is cute towns laid out like crop circles; women wearing beehives neatly coiffed above their antennae; and saucer-shaped cars wobbling inches from the pavement. Sounds picture-perfect but before the alien can go home Lem must thwart a paranoid general (Gary Oldman) and win the girl next door (Jessica Biel) which means that Chuck must act as his preeningly unreliable life coach. Fortunately many chases and pratfalls attend their journey. The biggest laughs come from a neighborhood dog modeled on the beast in Alien that pees acid and from the robotic six-wheeled NASA rover thats strongly reminiscent of WALL-E. An awkward European-American co-production Planet 51mainly succeeds at reminding you of all the better movies that inspired it.

A high concept gets low execution in ""Planet 51"" a lame-brained toon that even kids will recognize as an insipid goof on sci-fi conventions. Any number of things have been and could still be done with the idea of picturing a space-voyaging Earthling as a scary alien from the point of view of another planets inhabitants but theres nothing funny provocative or involving about what ""Shrek"" co-writer Joe Stillman and the team from Madrid-based Ilion Animation Studios do with the notion here. Sony release will serve as family-aud holiday season filler until bigger titles arrive. One can only speculate that too many cooks were part of the problem as this meager effort credits three directors four idea men and 13 executive producers. It isnt even that the central concept is bad An American astronaut arrives on a planet he believes is uninhabited only to find a civilization startlingly similar to 50s small-town Middle America right down to the paranoia about imminent alien invasion. The problem doesnt lie in the reversal of the cliche but in the fact that the picture trades in nothing but them. The astronaut Capt. Charles ""Chuck"" Baker (voice by Dwayne Johnson) is a red-headed red-blooded he-man while the locals beginning with lowly planetarium worker Lem (Justin Long) are mostly dweeby types who resemble ""Shrek""-green humans who make up in moppy hair and forehead antennae what they lack in noses. Chuck and Lem initially freak each other out before the latter helps protect the former from zealous know-nothings led by imperious Gen. Grawl (Gary Oldman) and so-smart-hes-crazy Professor Kipple (John Cleese) who cant wait to separate Chuck from his brain for scientific purposes. Beginning with the way Chuck and Lem blithely toss off as a curious coincidence the fact that they happen to speak the same language their utter lack of curiosity about each other and their respective worlds is ridiculous; even ""Jimmy Neutron"" which ""Planet 51"" rather resembles in its look and setting took a greater interest in the society it depicts than this does. Instead the picture devotes itself to tiresomely repetitive scenes of frenzied jeopardy accompanied by music that shifts gears every 15 seconds to underline whatever response is desired and larded with refs to famous antecedents (""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" ""2001"" ""Star Wars"" ""E.T."" ""Alien"" et al.) and an innocuous putative romance between Lem and neighbor Neera (Jessica Biel). Pic quickly grows aggravating because its clear theres no imagination in play only the recycling of familiar motifs and the attempted generation of Pavlovian responses based on expected character behavior and generic action. But it might have been worse Its defects could have been magnified by 3D.
