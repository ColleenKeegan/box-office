The estimable Andrews still straight of spine and perfect of pitch (though sadly a tad raspy since recovering from throat surgery) gets revenge of sorts by playing Henry Higgins to young Anne Hathaways Eliza in ""The Princess Diaries"" Garry Marshalls bumpy but endearing girls fairy tale. Based on Meg Cabots ""Bridget Joness Diary""-style novel for teens ""Diaries"" presents Mia Thermopolis a shy San Francisco teen whose life is turned upside down when her royal grandma (Andrews) suddenly announces that Mia is heir to the throne of Genovia. This news is as Mia says ""bigger than orthodonture"" and kicks off a whirlwind of ""princess lessons"" in which she learns to sit straight eat politely read Virginia Woolf and ultimately believe in herself. ""The Princess Diaries""    With Julie Andrews Anne Hathaway Hector Elizondo Heather Matarazzo. Directed by Garry Marshall from a screenplay by Gina Wendkos based on the novel by Meg Cabot. 111 minutes. Rated G. Various theaters. All this sounds a bit dreary and Marshall -- who made countless teens yearn to be hookers with ""Pretty Woman"" -- hardly seems the type to pull it off. And I could have done without Mias teen-queen makeover which made her look alarmingly like a junior Julia Roberts. But Andrews tucks the film into her carpet bag and walks away with it. Whether trilling ""Goodbye trolley people"" to a gaggle of cable-car riders or dancing a marvelously subtle tango with Hector Elizondo shes pure screen royalty.

Starring Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews. Directed by Garry Marshall. (G. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Garry Marshalls ""The Princess Diaries"" is a little like his movie ""Beaches"" in that its about a friendship between two girls. And its more than a little like his big hit ""Pretty Woman"" Its about a young lady rough around the edges who takes lessons in decorum to be transformed into a princess. Its like both those Marshall films and yet its better a lot better. Indeed ""The Princess Diaries"" may be Marshalls best movie. Here the sweetness of spirit that has governed his work -- that made ""Beaches"" too corny and ""Pretty Woman"" a prostitution romp clueless and distasteful -- no longer seems incongruous. Instead we get something nice a sweet movie from a sweet director. ENJOYABLE FOR KIDS PARENTS In making this family film one never senses that Marshall is slumming. If anything he has found his calling. ""The Princess Diaries"" is entertaining and pleasing for children and parents and not in the schizophrenic way of most kids movies which toss naughty in-jokes over the kiddies heads. This time parents and children can watch the same movie and enjoy it for the same reasons. The picture stars newcomer Anne Hathaway who starts off the film looking hopelessly ungainly. She plays Mia a gangly klutzy San Franciscan  who has bad posture and cant do a thing with her hair. She and her best friend played by the luminous and strangely lovely Heather Matarazzo (""Welcome to the Dollhouse"") enjoy the comradeship of outcasts. Marshall uses San Francisco locations in the time-honored tradition with Golden Gate Bridge vistas and shots of people walking up steep hills. It makes for an ideal world in which to place this modern fairy tale about an average 15-year-old girl who finds out that she is heir to the throne of a small European kingdom. The reigning queen of Genovia is played by Julie Andrews looking as gracious and lovely as she did at this years Oscars. The queen knows that if she doesnt persuade her granddaughter to accept the throne Genovia will be swallowed by a neighboring country. But Mia at first isnt interested. Its the only sour note in the film -- the brattiness of Mia early on when she cant appreciate her good luck. REGALES WITH REGAL REACTION Most of the comic situations turn on the princess ungainliness -- her first formal dinner is a slapstick disaster -- but the laughs surprisingly dont come from watching Hathaways clumsiness but Andrews pained reactions. The queen is Andrews best showcase in years making ideal use of the actress distinctive brittleness and warmth. Hathaway is not a natural comic but her acting has a truthfulness that gives ""The Princess Diaries"" its emotional core. She is also a chameleon who from the most unpromising of beginnings blossoms before our eyes into near- Audrey Hepburn-level loveliness. AUTHENTIC RELATIONSHIP As the princess grows into her role she is no longer the awkward girl who made her best friend feel so safe. Hathaways scenes with Matarazzo have the authentic ring of young adolescence two scared kids trying to hold on to their friendship talking things over. In addition to its other virtues ""The Princess Diaries"" has a real-live pop star in its cast though its not one anybody under 25 has probably heard of Mandy Moore in the obligatory role of Mias high school nemesis.

More than a decade later ""Pretty Woman"" director Garry Marshall hasnt forgotten the thrill of female transubstantiation - or of box office gratification In the girl-empowering fairy tale The Princess Diaries a gawky teenager (played by newcomer Anne Hathaway) morphs into a royal highness under the attentive ministrations of her grandmother (played by Julie Andrews - My Fair Lady herself) who turns out to be a rich queen ready to turn over the keys to the kingdom of Genovia. That country may be as fictional as the Marx Brothers Fredonia but a girls wish that someday someone will acknowledge her essential regal female self is a powerful fact. And this charming if unnecessarily coronation-length production gets the duckling-to-swan ambivalence just right. Hathaways Mia Thermopolis favors sparkly blue nail polish and lives in San Francisco with her hippie-artist mother (Caroline Goodall) unaware that her late father was an actual prince. Shes an interesting misfit more akin to the heroine of MTVs Daria than to the outcast teen girls of ""Six Feet Under"" or ""Ghost World"" and in scenes with Mia and her friends (including Heather Matarazzo as her geek-rebel confidante) and tormenters (especially Mandy Moore as a snooty Miss Popularity) Marshall conveys the sense of relentless torment secret princesses endure every day. He directs Gina Wendkos girl-wise script (based on the novel by Meg Cabot) with avuncular affection and by his standards a minimum of court jestering and he encourages moments of appropriate delirium among his large cast. (Sandra Ohs every moment as a school vice principal is heaven.) Best of all Julie Andrews reigns her formidable antiPoppins-ish dignity its own form of hilarity.

"USATODAY.com - Girls will royally enjoy The Princess Diaries Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 08/02/2001 - Updated 0217 PM ET Girls will royally enjoy The Princess Diaries By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY The Princess Diaries (out of four) Stars Anne Hathaway Julie Andrews Mandy Moore Director Garry Marshall Distributor Disney Rating G Scooters soy nuts and Dr. Martens clodhoppers. Theres no mistaking the schoolgirls enrolled in The Princess Diaries for anything but 21st century models. One classmate even has her own backup singers. She may be played by pop starlet Mandy Moore but its doubtful Diana Ross got away with such diva antics in senior high. Despite appearances however the Disney fantasy is a mostly enchanting even smart throwback to the studios one-time fondness for youthful female fantasies. Remember Hayley Mills in The Parent Trap or Jodie Foster in Freaky Friday? Read more Video The Princess Diaries trailer Lets put it this way Diaries will be adored by 10-year-old girls who think theyre 14 going on 18 thanks to a comic gem of a performance by Anne Hathaway. As the gawky San Francisco teen who learns shes the heir to the throne of a small European nation shes lovely and funny at the same time -- not as easy as it looks. Moms meanwhile will delight in recalling their adolescent anxieties and firsts. First kiss first car first cup of tea with the queen of Genovia. Thats where the pictures crown jewel comes in. As Hathaways estranged grandmother a glorious-as-ever Julie Andrews proves she doesnt have to be hoisted in the air like Mary Poppins to float through a Disney film. Her graceful entrance is enough to make you curtsy with joy. The queen takes the ugly duckling under her wing and teaches her about manners public speaking and etiquette. If the pair grow cozier and prim granny loosens up as a result all the better. Andrews also bestows upon Hathaway the greatest gift of all -- the ultimate makeover. Director Garry Marshall (Pretty Woman) is in too great a rush to get to the magic moment. Good riddance to those bushy brows though. Theres a reason Larry Miller as a self-promoting stylist refers to the unruly critters as ""Frida"" and ""Kahlo."" Grooming is barely half the battle thank goodness especially after the once-frizzy Hathaway comes out looking like a post-spa Julia Roberts with an impish pinch of Joan Cusack. Once word of her princess status gets out she must cope with media snoops a jealous best friend and the shallow boy of her dreams. Hathaways true Prince Charming is a mousy musician with Oasis bangs who worships her from afar and Marshall stretches out her love woes like a wad of overchewed bubblegum. While Hathaway waffles over her royal fate what we really want to see is her and Andrews as they finally share a warm weepy embrace. Marshall wisely waits just long enough to grant our wish. Like its heroine The Princess Diaries isnt always perfect. But it fills an empty spot in the hearts of girls of all ages who have been pining all summer for a movie like this.

The mediocre conditions in the once-royal land of live-action family movies are hardly improved by ""The Princess Diaries."" Based on the Meg Cabot novel that appeared last fall and was quickly ushered into the summer schedule by Disney -- which once upon a time wrote the book on the family-film form -- this is barely a step above the Mouses ""Wonderful World of Disney"" stable of TV pics. While Julie Andrews comports herself with unflappable class as the queen of tiny mythical Euro principality Genovia and co-star Anne Hathaway is a mildly enjoyable Eliza Doolittle to Andrews Henry Higgins the entire project under helmer Garry Marshall exudes a pre-fab quality. As one of the only G-rated studio releases of the year pic will have a run at a potentially large tot-to-early teen girl audience but only average returns should be expected though the ancillary train may earn a queenly sum. Awkward Mia just wants to get through the 10th grade. Her gawkiness in everything from debate class to softball at the tony private Grove School in San Francisco is beyond the pale especially when we observe that her after-school job is as a rock-climbing instructor at a trendy indoor gym. The only two people she can lean on are loyal gal pal Lilly (Heather Matarazzo) and her own artist mom Helen (Caroline Goodall) who has converted an old fire station into the most tantalizing and least imaginatively filmed home in any movie this year. Otherwise Mia is the target of the bullying darts of reigning school cheerleader-bitch Lana (Mandy Moore) and her minions. However the local arrival of Queen Clarisse forces the revelation of a secret that mom Helen has kept from Mia Helens ex-husband the recently deceased Philippe was next in line for the Genovian throne making his only child Mia the rightful heir. No way stutters Mia is she ruling a whole country but this is Julie Andrews shes dealing with and soon the girl is deep into etiquette training. Marshall and screenwriter Gina Wendkos often waste the charming comic tone and observations of Cabots book especially here where the reformation of Mia is depicted almost off-handedly. Wendkos script dutifully installs roadblocks in Mias path but her future as princess is never in doubt; its in her training where the comedy should lie but virtually never does. Instead energy is wasted on a series of bland repetitive scenes at school where the taunting of Mia goes on and on where Mia goes for the wrong guy (Erik Von Detten) and ignores Mr. Right (Robert Schwartzman) and where the San Francisco media learning of Mias secret attacks her with waves of cameras and microphones. Thus the pic loses the irony of Andrews once herself Eliza Doolittle schooling Hathaway who shows a few instincts for physical comedy. Andrews is ideal casting and refreshingly assured as is Hector Elizondo as the queens discreet security man who befriends Mia. Matarazzo plays Lilly as if her Dawn Wiener in ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" had adjusted a bit more socially but not enough for the boiling anger to subside. For some reason S.F. mayor Willie Brown drops in for a credited cameo thats all of one line; even odder Larry Miller drops in for an uncredited cameo of several scenes worth as royal makeover artist Paolo. Per the norm with Marshalls productions the look is polished and ultra-straight while the soundtrack is pockmarked with desperate-sounding jokey inserts that suggest having been included in post-production.
