Media San Francisco Chronicle Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore Family action comedy. Directed by Brad Peyton. With the voices of Bette Midler Nick Nolte James Marsden and Christina Applegate. (PG. 82 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The super-spy James Bond parody has been done to death at the movies already - with children guinea pigs Pixar superheroes and Mike Myers in a chest toupee. Now along comes ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" a zippy new example of the form that exploits every cliche with abundant good cheer and an admirable unapologetic ridiculousness. Its a film about talking cats and dogs and as such it includes a fair portion of butt-sniffing jokes. This is a fact. Its also a sequel to a lackluster 2001 movie ""Cats amp; Dogs"" which organized stilted jokes and awkward computer effects around a lame plot involving a villainous scheme to distribute tainted fake snow to the masses. On the backs of mice. While Jeff Goldblum writhed in chains. These too are facts. But theres a ray of hope for crummy movies The sequel cant get much worse. In this case its considerably better adapting the 007 template in a story of a crazed bald cat named Kitty Galore (voiced by a hissing chichi Bette Midler) and her malevolent plot to conquer the world.

Pictures Review Cats amp; Dogs sequel better than 1st 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Its brilliant in its simplicity She just needs to broadcast certain high-pitched sounds and the planets entire dog population will launch into vicious attack mode. People will have no choice but to stick them all in kennels. Kitty will then move in subduing defenseless humans. (As she puts it ""I will enslave all mankind"") Why would she do such a thing? Because her owners rejected her when she lost all her fur in a depilatory accident thats why. Cats and dogs thus unite to defeat Kitty overcoming an ancient and bitter rivalry in order to share classified intel and roam San Francisco for the truth. On the dog side impulsive Diggs (James Marsden) gruff mentor Butch (Nick Nolte) and smooth-boss beagle Lou (Neil Patrick Harris) last seen as a wriggling puppy. On the cat side spy puss Catherine (Christina Applegate). The lone winged vertebrate is Katt Williams as Seamus a breathtakingly stupid pigeon. Chris ODonnell still human plays a cop. Bond references abound as well they should. The hideouts are subterranean the gizmos are awesome and Roger Moore voices a bow-tied cat named Lazenby. Theres a henchman with shiny metal teeth. The brassy music grooves and swoons over slinky opening credits and the climax is almost as drawn out and convoluted as the genre demands. Grown-ups in the audience will also enjoy clever riffs on distinctly non-Bond subjects including kitties stoned on catnip and a fluffy Persian send-up of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in which Sean Hayes returns as the diabolical Mr. Tinkles. ""Cats amp; Dogs The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" comes with its own pet treat a short raucous 3-D Warner Bros. cartoon starring Road Runner Wile E. Coyote and a decent length of Acme Bungee Cord. Felines and canines can reach detente but those two animals will never get along.

""Cats amp; Dogs"" is a mangy moth-eaten affair that barks up the wrong trees on both the narrative and technical sides. Obsessed far more with high-tech espionage paraphernalia routine scenes of destruction and anti-cat propaganda than with creating an involving storyline or appealing characters either two- or four-legged this comically intended battle of the species is family entertainment for families that will buy anything. Premise alone has drawing power and emphasis on electronic gear wont hurt with the ""Spy Kids"" crowd meaning that Warner Bros. should be able to draw sizable numbers at first but shouldnt count upon heavy repeat biz or word-of-mouth to maintain a strong B.O. pace. Its amazing that six years after ""Babe"" no film has come along to rival let alone match it in the talking animal department. Commercially speaking the new ""Dr. Dolittle"" films have probably come the closest and ""Stuart Little"" was reasonably effective in combining critters with humans despite an animated feel. Disneys ""Dalmatians"" pictures unfortunately declined to have the dogs speak when their animated predecessor dictated that they really should have and this latest attempt is so mechanical looking in spots that you often wish it had been done as the animated picture it was originally intended to be. The initial miscalculations however are all in the script by first-time scenarists John Requa and Glenn Ficarra. Instead of creating something like a turf war in which the interests of dogs and cats could be mentally and emotionally weighed film offers an intangible and it has to be said ludicrous situation in which physically ugly fascist-style cats intend to take over the world. Not only does this rep a turnoff for cat lovers from the outset but it renders moot the main line of the pictures ad copy -- ""Who Will You Root For?"" Theres no choice. Initial hostilities are actually instigated by a hound who chases a feline all around a suburban neighborhood until deservedly being catnapped. For some reason this incident provokes the assemblage of international canine superagents dedicated to fighting ""the great cat menace"" a movement run by a flat-faced white Persian kitty named Mr. Tinkles out of a Xanadu-like mansion. Unexpectedly recruited to the canine cause is Lou a Beagle puppy recently adopted by the Brody family. Dad (Jeff Goldblum) is a perennially distracted scientist who spends all his time in his home lab researching a cure for humans allergies to dogs. Thoroughly neglected are his wife (Elizabeth Perkins) and son Scott (Alexander Pollock) the latter a dour kid whose only defining trait is how lousy he is at soccer. As the would-be allergy cure holds great importance to both sides the Brody household becomes the front line of the war which sees Mr. Tinkles send in feline ninja fighters and a Russian agent as part of a plan that long thereafter climaxes in another catnapping -- this time of the Brodys -- and in a weird attempt to make the entire world allergic to dogs by sending out an army of infected mice to spread the infectant. But no vested interest is generated in any of this since nothing remotely real is at stake and there are no characters to warm up to. The human beings are total write-offs -- Goldblum decked out in unattractive sideburns and goatee is forever ducking in and out of his lab Perkins has nothing to do and Pollock is mostly glum -while the cats are uniformly mean sneaky and duplicitous. Still Sean Hayes injects a measure of wit into some of Mr. Tinkles more disdainful lines and co-writer Ficarra has a bit of fun voicing the condescending Russian commando. That leaves the dogs and only two of them are drawn with any particular dimension Lou and Butch the ground forces leader. Alec Baldwin endows the latter with a gruff stoicism born of experience while Tobey Maguire makes the former amiable enough even if the script hardly makes the pup a very inspiring central hero. In conception and execution it feels like a big mistake to have designed extreme physical action capable only by cartoon figures then to have forced ""real"" animals to enact it. Of course ""anything"" is possible now through a combination of actual and virtual creatures but to have purportedly real dogs and cats flying through the air flinging weapons at each other and enacting ""Crouching Tiger"" and ""Matrix""-style martial arts contorts them in unnatural ways and makes them look weird and unappealing. Some blatantly mechanical-looking pooches dont help either. Additionally the existence of an alternate reality in which animals can talk with one another without humans knowing about it requires a certain consistency of approach a notion ""Cats amp; Dogs"" both flaunts and disregards. The point of reference here is not only ""Babe"" but the ""Toy Story"" features in which the characters were so cleverly put through their paces in ways that never interfered with their status as inanimate toys from the human p.o.v. Here the existence of a whole infrastructure of scientific equipment and animal military operations is too prominent and elaborate to be explained away somehow; part of the delight of many animal stories lies in the thought of the creatures getting away with so much under the nose of human beings but that line is not walked skillfully here. To be sure there is a great deal of technical know-how at work in this picture but it is not applied in a way thats much fun.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Starring Jeff Goldblum. Featuring the voices of Alec Baldwin Sean Hayes Tobey Maguire and Susan Sarandon. Directed by Lawrence Guterman. (PG. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The best way to enjoy ""Cats amp; Dogs"" like puppy love is to go into it with lowered expectations. Sad but true. ""Cats amp; Dogs"" is of course the live-action computer-goosed comedy about the war between humankinds two most cherished house pets. We already know about the war the very tiresome one at that between their masters cat lovers and dog lovers. Fortunately thats not the issue here. In some quarters -- especially among those who saw the preview trailer -- this movie might have been one of the most anticipated of the summer. That may be part of the problem. I wanted to love this movie too. After all I saw the trailer. Then I saw the whole thing and sat there waiting for it to take off. And sat there. And sat there. Not that ""Cats"" is a dog. It is never less than interesting. But who wants interesting from a movie called ""Cats amp; Dogs""? It needs to grab the audience by the scruff of the neck and shake it. The trailer was all quick hits. This movie may be too much in love with its own cleverness. The setup goes on forever. It sure has a lot of explaining to do. Then finally it becomes a game of ""Can you top this?"" Thank heavens for Alec Baldwin and Sean Hayes. We dont see them but we hear them and theyre sly comic lifesavers. The basic idea is delightful. At the feet of humans and unknown to them cats and dogs live in an alternative universe of spies and counteragents. The cats are out to take over the universe. The dogs are out to stop them. Humans meanwhile go on as they always do clueless. Pets assume ""animal behavior"" when a human appears -- wetting down fire hydrants digging up lawns -- to throw them off the scent. The principal clueless human is played by Jeff Goldblum the familiar figure of the preoccupied scientist and neglectful dad. Hes looking for a cure for animal allergies -- that is for people who are allergic to animals. Covered with wires and doodads he sticks himself with gunk from an injector gun and sniffs cats. He knows hes not a good soccer dad but by golly he tries to pretend hes interested. ""Cats amp; Dogs"" takes place at the heart of the American dream the suburban family home. From the moment a cat retrieves the newspaper and starts scratching it apart we know these felines are going to be a handful. ""We got a serious problem"" says the shepherd Butch in the hard-boiled voice of Baldwin. Butch has been around the block a few times. He will mentor the innocent-appearing new beagle Lou (Tobey Maguire) whom he calls Kid. Butchs doghouse is chockablock with state-of-the-art electronic equipment. It puts him in touch with the nerve center of the anti-cat movement. The evil cats are led by the Napoleonic Mr. Tinkles a pet in the mansion of a comatose tycoon. Mr. Tinkles who has a diabolical plot to make humans allergic to dogs is voiced by Hayes who plays Jack on ""Will amp; Grace."" Things have been moving along rather dutifully. Now it gets interesting. Mr. Tinkles is a snippy white-haired Persian who must endure the tycoons endlessly upbeat housekeeper-nurse who thinks dressing cats up in bonnets is cute. Tinkles justifiably hates her. The dying tycoon attached to an oxygen tank and then to a wheelchair has more than a passing resemblance to Dr. Strangelove which brings up a curious point. Basically this childrens movie is a parody of the conventions of the spy thriller. Didnt it occur to anybody that spy thrillers are an adult form of movie? Kids by and large are not interested in them with the huge exception of Robert Rodriguezs ""Spy Kids."" That movie puts kids at the center of the action not sitting around wondering exactly what all these funny animals are up to anyway. ""Cats amp; Dogs"" makes a great deal of its ""real"" world of live-action animals and humans. The movie gets funnier and wilder the less ""real"" and more cartoonish the animals become especially by the final showdown when Tinkles impersonates his master gliding into factory headquarters a kind of super training facility. Until a certain point the animals talk only among themselves and put a lid on it whenever humans are around. Late in the game one of the creatures will finally speak directly to a human and it is a wonderful moment. Theres no question that many of the spy cats and dog agents are amusing. Susan Sarandon is a very intriguing stray saluki hound. Ninja cat warriors with green eyes for computerized night vision drop from the skies. A kitty infiltrator innocently brought into the house has an incongruously big voice (provided by one of the screenwriters Glenn Ficarra) and a Russian accent. ""You fight like a poodle"" the kitty sneers.

"CNN.com - Review Cats amp; Dogs a tired animal act - July 4 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW Lots of technology little entertainment Review Cats amp; Dogs a tired animal act By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- ""Cats amp; Dogs"" is a shrieking blitzkrieg of flash and movement in which household pets comically square off against each other in a high-tech turf war. Though its furry cast members are sometimes cute the movie systematically converts ""Babes"" tender talking-animals appeal into just another soulless gadget-fest. Think ""Tomb Raider"" on four legs. If you dare. Unlike ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" (last months talking-animal picture) the focus here is on digital effects rather than sweetly detailed characters with a lot of big-name performers supplying voices to the battling creatures. Although the humans in the cast are secondary participants Jeff Goldblum ""stars"" as Professor Brody the typical Goldblum scientist who goes bug-eyed when he breathlessly reels off theories to people who have no idea what hes talking about. The good professor works in his suburban home laboratory trying to perfect a vaccine for folks who are allergic to dogs. Since he uses himself as a guinea pig hes often covered in unsightly hives and attached to monitors. Hes also got a supportive long-suffering wife (Elizabeth Perkins) and a son Scott (Alexander Pollock).

"USATODAY.com - Cats amp; Dogs do make a mess Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 07/03/2001 - Updated 0937 AM ET Cats amp; Dogs do make a mess By Mike Clark USA TODAY Cats amp; Dogs (out of four) Stars Elizabeth Perkins Jeff Goldblum Sean Hayes Susan Sarandon Director Lawrence Guterman Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG for animal action In the early 90s Elizabeth Perkins made a wonderful David Letterman appearance with a home movie devoted to her cats unique peccadillo. Whenever she would whistle the theme to The Andy Griffith Show her playfully pesky pet would bop in from the next room to bite her toes. Now thats charming a hard concept to apply to Cats amp; Dogs. Read more Related Review Mike Clark gives Cats amp; Dogs two stars Readers say felines win by a whisker More reader response Fighting like cats and dogs Video Who do you love more? Cats amp; Dogs trailer Photo gallery Animals on film The film stars Perkins and a depressive Jeff Goldblum as her husband another suburban crackpot scientist who must be mighty well paid to live in such nice suburban digs. (Think Honey I shrunk the beagle.) This is more live-action kiddie fare in which special effects enable dogs (the heroes) and cats (the villains) to mouth words like Babe the pig whos obviously better than either at picking his screen projects. A ""power-mad Persian cat"" named Mr. Tinkles (voice of Will amp; Graces Sean Hayes) organizes a massive feline world movement against the guard dogs whove been protecting the human race. By any rational standard the payoff in this wannabe ""action pic"" is about half as good as the worst Bond movie youve ever seen. The movie however might be seen as a treat by people who cant bring themselves to knock a film featuring furry friends. Its really a migraine-inducing furniture-upending jumble. The worst Disney comedies of the 60s primed us to accept perhaps unwillingly the sight of pets destroying houses -- without being pound-bound by nightfall. But do Goldblum and Perkins have to smile so goofily after the destruction to their house? Compounding the problems are self-conscious attempts at humor such as a stray Saluki hound (voiced by Susan Sarandon) calling herself ""domestically challenged""; Charlton Heston in doggie voiceover heading a U.N.-type canine conference; and the soundtrack playing the Mission Impossible theme and an Ennio Morricone spaghetti-western knockoff during suspense scenes. Until a painfully belated but funny subplot involving mice perks up the finale this family entertainment hard sell lags far behind even Dr. Dolittle 2. Youre likely to find a more favorable review only on this films alternative version of CNN (Canine News Network).

Posted July 20 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT A formidable arsenal of computer-assisted puppets and live animals has been assembled to demonstrate that feline-versus-canine competition is a threat to world peace. Or so goes the lightheartedly silly premise of this fanciful comedy with animal-voice contributions from Tobey Maguire Susan Sarandon and Alec Baldwin. Theres just one problem The plot and script sag like worn-out chew toys. Not only isnt this Babe its not even SNLs Toonces the driving cat.
