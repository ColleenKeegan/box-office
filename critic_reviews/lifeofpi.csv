Against all the odds Ang Lees epic 3D adaptation might just unite the two camps fans will lap up the films dedication to capturing the spirit of Martels words while doubters may well find themselves - slowly grudgingly - persuaded by the films astonishing visual confidence and narrative force.Three actors (notably teenager Suraj Sharma) play Pi the middle-class lad from Pondicherry whose adolescent explorations of faith are interrupted when the container ship hes travelling on goes down in the Pacific. Everyone on board is drowned except for Pi and four denizens of his fathers zoo among them a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The question is how long boy and tiger can coexist miles from land and fresh water and with precious little hope of rescue.A word of warning for the traditionalists Life of Pi is a film steeped in CGI and there are very few shots here without some kind of process element. But this isnt some sort of sickly soupy digital phantasmagoria Lee handles the special effects and especially the 3D with absolute surety creating moments of jaw-dropping eye-ravishing beauty. Finding Neverland writer David Magees script isnt quite so successful mostly he manages to avoid both syrupy sentiment and hazy magical thinking but a late diversion onto an island randomly populated by meerkats feels jarringly out of place while some of the voiceover is a little heavy-handed.But it all comes together in a blunt but forceful finale as the scales fall from our eyes and all our doubts are cleverly addressed. Its here that Lee stamps his claim on Martels work most forcefully and all that rampant visual excess comes into sharp focus. For Lee this isnt just a story about God life death and our place in the world - its about cinema too and how in the modern age its inextricably interlinked with everything we feel and experience. Its a remarkable moment in a remarkable film flawed yes but marvellously ambitious and unforgettably gorgeous to look at.

The story itself is an amazing one with twists in all the right places a dose of sadness in the plot but triumph too. You really feel for Pi thanks to the way the story is told and the direction in the film. The social effects are brilliant too - very convincing as you will quite honestly think its all real. My only tip would be to make sure you keep listening and concentrate at the end section. Its quite important but really ties the whole story together; if you dont get it you might not get that nice feeling of all the loose ends coming together as I did.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJan 10 2013PaulaFeaturedThis film suprised me and not just because I havent gotten around to reading the book (yet).

Everyone knows Ang Lee is a great director and he really does the best he can especially visually. However the lead actor lacks depth and isnt convincing at all plus theres a syrupy script with its quasi-religious themes.

Life of Pi the book is definitely meant for adults as far as I know and the film though family-friendly to a certain extent is not what I would have considered an entertaining film for children in the first place. Richard Parker would never eat Pi of course. Pi is a far too nice and too sweet and too kind and too decent young man for that dont you think so?

It is long slow and dull. Apart from the whale at night scene the 3D really doesnt add much if anything to the film. Where to start? The plot is dull and never really explains the finding God and redemption theme. There are a number of sub plots like the Love of his life girl left behind that arent really developed and the meerkat island feels like something the Beatles would have come up with after a bad LSD trip. Sorry some people might find this enlightening but I found it really rather dull. Maybe like the Julia Roberts ""Eat Pray Love"" disaster flick some books are best left unfilmed.

The effects are quite wonderful even as we saw them in 2D but the beginning and end where the protagonist sets up then explains his story both laced with religio-babble betray an anxiety - justified as it turns out - about the narratives ability to convey the story - and meta-story.

Based on the novel by Yann Martel a young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. (Video amp; Photo 20th Century Fox) By Joe Morgenstern Nov. 22 2012 720 p.m. ET Hunger says the desperate hero in ""Life of Pi"" ""can change everything you think you knew about yourself."" So too can the ineffably beautiful images of Ang Lees film change what you think you knew about the appeal of monodramas (although the hero isnt really alone in the unfolding tale); about water (not what it is or what it can do but how it can look) and about the relatively new fast-evolving field of computer-generated imagery. Mr. Lees film is stronger as a visual experience--especially in 3-D--than an emotional one but it has a final plot twist that may also change what you thought you knew about the ancient art of storytelling. By now the commanding graphics of the trailers and print ads have established the premise of the narrative which was adapted by David Magee from Yann Martels celebrated novel. Following a shipwreck a young Indian named Pi Patel played remarkably well by Suraj Sharma finds himself sharing a lifeboat with a huge Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. How the two of them got there is the stuff of the preface which covers Pis childhood as the son of a Pondicherry zoo owner in an agreeably whimsical style that evokes ""Amelie"" then depicts the mid-Pacific disaster zoo animals and all with--high compliment coming--the intensity of ""The Black Stallion."" Another part of the preface slow and somewhat clumsy but essential to honoring the book involves a writer played by Rafe Spall interviewing the adult Pi who is portrayed by the always superb Irrfan Khan. ENLARGE Suraj Sharma Twentieth Century Fox Once the ship has been wrecked and sunk by an epic storm long stretches of the action are confined to the lifeboat (where the tiger as many have noted with reference to Alfred Hitchcocks ""Lifeboat"" plays the Tallulah Bankhead role). Pi does manage to build a fragile raft to keep his distance from his toothy companion for as long as he can. Still the all-too-intimate relationship between (vegetarian) man and (carnivorous) beast lies at the heart of the film and has its spiritual resonances as well as its practical and logistical fascinations. Spiritual resonances were what attracted the interviewer to his subject in the first place; specifically someone describing Pis ordeal as ""a story that would make you believe in God."" Maybe yes maybe no but at the very least the story makes you ponder such questions as the mutual empathy of souls Richard Parkers not excluded; the human will to survive and humanitys place in the global skein of life. One deeply moving moment comes when Pi a Hindu who has studied the Muslim and Christian faiths catches a fish kills it weeps for having killed it and says through his tears ""Thank you Lord Vishnu thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives."" Yet its the spectacle of Pis journey that makes the most lasting impression. Man and beast must work out an armed truce--first out of need then out of unstated respect. The tigers weapons are his teeth and claws; the man has his brain. ""Maybe Richard Parker cant be tamed"" Pi tells himself ""but with Gods will he can be trained."" Theres much more to marvel at in this production a whale breaching in the night immensely phosphorescent; a carnivorous island literally crawling with little meerkats (and almost submerged by a tsunami of symbolism); an assault by squadrons of flying fish and most marvelous of all the ocean. Has anyone before Ang Lee rethought the visual essence of water? What he and his cinematographer Claudio Miranda have done in several sequences is to treat water like a mirror a radiant medium that floats the lifeboat and its passengers on a glassy surface or to render it invisible a magical absence that suspends living creatures in a state of ecstatic grace. Ive waited until now to discuss the nature of the tiger which--or more properly who since hes such a vivid character--is the real thing in certain sequences but mainly a creature spawned by computers with bits and bytes where his strands of DNA ought to be. In one sense this fully believable CGI creation is a wonder of technology and a tribute to the current state of the animation arts. Yet the greater significance of Richard Parker is that hes fully integrated into the film and a tribute to the directors virtuosity. In ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" Mr. Lee pulled off a similar feat of integration--not with a tiger despite the title but with Chinese wire fighting that matched the elegance of the production as a whole. Here working from an intricately literary source he has visualized convincingly and completely a magical world in which a dying man clings to his planet and a tiger burns bright night and day. ENLARGE Anthony Hopkins as Alfred Hitchcock. Fox Searchlight Hitchcock ""Hitchcock"" rings false from start to finish. This lifeless botch was directed by Sacha Gervasi from John J. McLaughlins adaptation of a Stephen Rebello book about the making of ""Psycho."" Anthony Hopkins plays the legendary director whose reputation took some lurid hits in a recent TV movie that had him treating Tippi Hedren very badly during filming of ""The Birds."" The first time we see Mr. Hopkins as Hitch hes standing on the set of an ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" episode teacup in hand. ""Oh good evening"" he says straight to the camera as was Hitchcocks wont and the casting of a fine actor as a peerless filmmaker promises to be fun--a stunt certainly but maybe an enjoyable one. Watch a clip from the film ""Hitchcock."" A love story between filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) and wife Alma Reville (Helen Mirren) during the filming of ""Psycho"" in 1959. Also starring Toni Collette. (Photo amp; Video Fox Searchlight) No such luck though. For openers Mr. Hopkins dials down the distinctive eccentricity of Hitchcocks accent which was so archly raffish or raffishly arch that it sometimes sounded like a speech impediment. Apart from a lovely private dance that this Hitchcock does in a theater lobby during the premiere of ""Psycho"" theres little joy in the portrayal that follows. And no wonder since the writing devoid of wit let alone wisdom reduces its subject to a little cluster of behaviors Hitchcock gorging boozing leering like a lecher peering like a peeping Tom while doubting the fidelity of his ever-faithful wife Alma. (Shes played by Helen Mirren who at least gets to focus her formidable energy on a good angry speech about his misplaced suspicions.) Alma more than her husband is the films reason for being. Hes full of self-doubt as ""Psycho"" goes into production ""Am I making a terrible mistake? What if its another Vertigo?"" (That line has an unintentional layer of irony since the British magazine Sight and Sound in the fullness of its unwisdom recently named ""Vertigo"" the best movie of all time.) ""Hitchcock"" is populated by faux-zircon representations of Hollywood power brokers of the period--a bland Lew Wasserman a defanged Barney Balaban--but the power behind Hitch is clearly his wife who not only shores up his sagging ego but takes his place on the set when hes too sick to direct and figures out during postproduction in the ""Psycho"" editing room how to save the shower scene. Now no one doubts the central role that Alma played in Hitchs life but the shower scene was never in need of saving and was surely not saved in postproduction by Alma or anyone else. (She did legend has it spot a moment when Janet Leigh blinked as the supposedly dead heroine and the offending frames were excised.) The dominant quality of Hitchcocks personality as an artist and a man was his drive for control and nowhere did that quality express itself more effectively than in the intricate planning of the shower scene that preceded the actual shooting. ""Hitchcock"" slashes that truth to tatters in the course of a larger crime against biography. ENLARGE The Easter Bunny and Santa Claus DreamWorks Animation Rise of the Guardians As ""Life of Pi"" demonstrates the sky is no longer the limit for computer animation. Watch ""Rise of the Guardians"" a computer-animated feature in vivid 3-D and youre caught up in soaring motion that knows no physical bounds. Whats more the kinetic energy is matched by stunning design and the story features multiple mythical heroes in a kid-friendly variant of ""The Avengers."" Still the movie may provoke a case of motion sickness--not the kind that causes nausea but a CGI-induced condition that leaves you slightly sick of all the swoopings swirlings and incessant chases and wishing everyone would occasionally settle down. Watch a clip from the animated film ""Rise of the Guardians."" When evil spirit Pitch (Jude Law) assaults Earth the Immortal Guardians team up to protect the innocence of children around the world. Also starring Chris Pine. (Photo amp; Video Paramount) The villain of the piece is a boogeyman named Pitch as in pitch black; hes voiced with amusing unctuousness by Jude Law. Pitchs push for global dominance is met by an ad hoc alliance of four prominent guardians of childrens welfare a surprising Santa brawny and tattooed with Alec Baldwin doing a hilarious Russian accent; an Easter Bunny whos closer to a kangaroo what with his boomerang and Hugh Jackmans Aussie accent; an iridescent and hummingbird-flighty Tooth Fairy whos given an endearingly earnest voice by Isla Fisher and shape-shifting Sandman whos mute--hes the Harpo of the group. A new recruit Jack Frost ( Chris Pine) is a winsome young flake with an identity crisis. ""Rise of the Guardians"" suffers from something akin to Jacks plight. From moment to moment it can be beguiling as in the intersection of Jack Frost a little boy named Jamie and the toy bunny the boy once loved. Yet the movie lacks a resonant center. The script seems to have been written by committee with members lobbying for each major character and the action set in vast environments all over the map spreads itself so thin that a surfeit of motion vitiates emotion. Think globally and dramatize locally should have been the watchword. DVD Focus ENLARGE Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (2000) When Ang Lees landmark martial-arts romance opened more than a decade ago I wrote that watching it felt like paradise regained--the kind of movie paradise we experienced as kids confronted by enchanting images bedazzling colors and miraculous beings who were exempt from the rules that govern everyday life. Chow Yun-fat is Li Mu Bai a master swordsman who has laid down his sword after decades of chivalric struggle. Michelle Yeoh is Yu Shu Lien the woman he loves. Zhang Ziyi is Jen Yu a pretty impulsive aristocrat who also happens to be a sword-fighter of almost mythic though covert ability. ENLARGE Tabu and Irfan Khan. Everett Collection The Namesake (2006) Irrfan Khan gives a magnificent performance opposite the Indian star Tabu; they play husband and wife who after an arranged marriage fly from New Delhi to the U.S. where they manage to raise an almost thoroughly American son--the namesake of the title--with the singular moniker of Gogol Ganguli. ( Kal Penn gives Gogol a charming goofiness that yields to endearing manhood.) Mira Nair directed this unusually pleasurable film which was adapted from the debut novel of the same name by Jhumpa Lahiri. (Mr. Khan also made an indelible impression as the nasty police inspector in ""Slumdog Millionaire."") ENLARGE Lust Caution Lust Caution(2007) Ang Lee meets Alfred Hitchcock in Mr. Lees long seductive yet almost thrill-free thriller set in Shanghai during the Japanese occupation of China in World War II. The heroine Wong Chia Chih (an impressive screen debut by Tang Wei) is a movie fan with a gift for acting that she discovered as a college student. Since her story resonates with ""Notorious"" and ""Suspicion"" were treated to fleeting Hitchcock clips. (The plot is also similar to Paul Verhoevens zestful ""Black Book."") The cast includes Tony Leung Chiu-wai the Hong Kong actor who was so hypnotically soulful in ""In the Mood for Love.""

"Life of Pi | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; life-of-pi ) Life of Pi (United States 2012) November 21 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Life of Pi is a curious juxtaposition of the mundane and the majestic; a film that strives for something grander than what it perhaps achieves. At times the simple story - one of spirituality and survival - exudes a quiet hypnotic power but there are also instances when it strikes a jarringly wrong note particularly toward the end. The good in Life of Pi easily outweighs the bad but it could be claimed that the production is more remarkable because of superlative special effects than because of its strength of narrative emotional impact or allegorical complexity. The movie like the book is divided into three segments. The first introduces us to the central character Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) whose name is short for ""Piscene"" but who changes it because it sounds too much like ""pissing."" We are given a brief primer of his early life and an exploration of his views of faith a morphing philosophy that includes elements of Hinduism Christianity and Islam. Essentially he simply wants to ""know"" God so he cherry-picks various aspects of different religions to create his own iteration. In India Pis family owns a zoo so he becomes comfortable around the animals although he learns a harsh lesson about the true nature of tigers when his father (Adil Hussain) forces him to watch an adult male Bengal Robert Parker make a meal of a live goat. Eventually economic issues force the Patel family to emigrate to Canada. They as well as the zoos animal occupants are packed aboard a freighter that makes the ocean crossing. In rough seas near the Marinas Trench the ship sinks. The only survivors are Pi and four animals. The shipwreck occurs roughly 45 minutes into the proceedings. The next hour which comprises the second segment of the movie explores the difficulties of crossing the Pacific on a 20-foot long lifeboat. Three of the four animals - a zebra a hyena and an orangutan - are quickly devoured by the fourth Richard Parker. Pi abandons the lifeboat for an improvised raft he engineers (which is tethered to the boat) but circumstances eventually force him to forge an uneasy co-existence with the tiger. To do that he has to prove himself to be the alpha male so he wont be attacked. The movies third segment which has a tacked-on feel offers an ""alternative"" narrative of Pis sea adventures. The problem with this part of the movie is that it is not dramatized. Instead of presenting us with a visual re-interpretation of events it offers Pi in a hospital bed telling this story which is fine for a book but not satisfying in a visual medium like film. This results in a profound sense of anticlimax. If a key principle of movies is ""show dont tell"" this is violated by Life of Pis third act. The movies structure neuters suspense by bookending the tale with scenes in modern-day Canada that feature a middle-aged Pi (Irrfan Khan) telling his story to a Canadian author (Rafe Spall). Theres never any question of whether Pi will survive his ordeal - just a question of how bad things will get and how he will manage to co-exist with the tiger. During the course of the story there are occasional breaks to allow the modern-day Pi to provide some commentary but these are infrequent enough that they dont interfere with the flow of the story. Unsurprisingly the most compelling portions of the movie encapsulate the scenes detailing Pis lifeboat ordeal. At its best Life of Pi rivals other recent ""survival"" stories like 127 Hours and Cast Away. Theres an undeniable fascination associated with exploring how Pis relationship with Richard Parker evolves. The film doesnt make the mistake of anthropomorphizing the tiger. He remains a predator to the end and only becomes Pis ""friend"" in the young mans mind. In a way hes like Wilson was to Tom Hanks character in Cast Away - the much-needed companion who staves off loneliness. The special effects used to craft Richard Parker are nothing short of amazing. At no point does one doubt that this is a living breathing tiger. In all likelihood the animal is CGI (its unthinkable that a real tiger would be used in many of these scenes and the creature is too fluid and lifelike to be animatronic). And although Richard Parker is the most obvious example of top-notch computer design its not the only one. The most spectacular instance involves a whale that explodes skyward from the ocean during a scene of eerie breathtaking beauty. The shipwreck is also impressive although director Ang Lee doesnt attempt to outdo James Cameron in this department. Thematically Life of Pi is as much about faith as it is about survival arguing that faith is necessary to survival. Pi believes it is the will of god that allows him to stay alive for more than 200 days at sea. His beliefs are not traditional - early in the film his father chides him for attempting to follow so many different religions - but he would describe himself as deeply spiritual. His journey is the will of god and like Job he doggedly accepts every setback without cursing the divine being to whom he prays. Director Ang Lee who accepted this project after a number of other high profile filmmakers departed has a more successful relationship with special effects than he had with Hulk but Life of Pi plays more to his strengths as a filmmaker focusing on exploring the internal life of a character. Lee wisely selects an unknown actor Suraj Sharma for the title role. With no other screen associations to his name theres no difficulty identifying him as anyone other than Pi. For someone without previous professional acting experience Sharma acquits himself admirably and manages not to be upstaged by either the tiger or the sea. The cast is comprised largely of faces who will not be overly familiar to mainstream American audience (although Irrfan Khan and Tabu are well-known to Bollywood movie viewers). Originally Lee cast Tobey Maguire as the writer to whom Pi tells his story but Maguires scenes were eventually re-filmed with Rafe Spall in the part because Lee felt it would be too jarring for viewers to see a high-profile actor in a small role. Life of Pi is a gorgeous movie; the decision to film and release it in 3-D may hurt it with more sophisticated viewers who have largely abandoned the format as cheap and gimmicky. Lee uses 3-D more overtly than some recent filmmakers but he avoids too many ""showy"" shots. There are also questions about whether the lack of vibrant color in some scenes is a deliberate stylistic choice or a 3-D artifact. My impression is that on balance 3-D neither adds nor detracts from the overall experience; its a question of individual preference. Life of Pi is difficult to market. Theres no easy way to sell a story in which half the movie is spent alone with a man and a tiger floating around the Pacific on a boat. Lees success as a filmmaker is that he makes this relationship as interesting as one between two human beings and uses the lack of dialogue as a strength. Life of Pi has a weak ending (more disappointing than disastrous) but the strange approach taken to the ""alternative"" story in no way detracts from the surehandedness with which the ""primary"" one is told. Theres an audience out there for this movie but the question is whether they will find it.

Last year Martin Scorsese showed how 3-D could be beautiful not just kinetic in ""Hugo"" and now Ang Lee has made the most visually stunning 3-D film yet with ""Life of Pi."" That just about defines the entire value of ""Life of Pi"" and its probably the only thing it will be remembered for. Otherwise ""Life of Pi"" is not nearly as successful It has the obviousness of a parable but none of the succinctness. Its a slow-moving fable with enough story and substance to make for one amazing Imax short. Instead the material is stretched beyond its limits into a long repetitive and often stagnant 127-minute feature film. Too bad but first lets talk about the animals. ""Life of Pi"" based on Yann Martels novel is framed as the recollection of a man whose father was a zookeeper in India and over the opening credits the camera takes us inside that zoo. One of the striking aspects of 3-D is the way it gives us bodies in space. We can see what actors really look like and in the case of animals we can see details of their bodies and their movements that somehow elude the usual two-dimensional process. Its simply gorgeous and fascinating to watch a succession of elephants zebras and giraffes. Had Lee chosen to linger in this zoo for a half hour few in the audience would complain. Alas we cant stay in the zoo. We must return to modern-day Canada where the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) is greeting a stranger into his home a writer who has wanted to meet him. As played by Rafe Spall the writer is shy tentative and weird - with the demeanor of an ineffectual serial killer if such a thing can be imagined - and he has arrived because he has heard that Pi has a great story. As in a story that will cause the writer to believe in the existence of God.

Photo 20th Century Fox Life of Pi infinity and beyond 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Right away ""Life of Pi"" grounds itself on loose soil. Why would Pi want to talk to this guy? OK maybe he would. Anythings possible. Better question Why would anyone in the audience want to listen? The movie doesnt give us a single reason to care about the writers spiritual quest nor does it in any way establish Pi as someone worthy of our attention. For the first half hour we see flashbacks to Pis early life and nothing in it is remarkable. As far as anyone watching is concerned some random guy is telling us his life story in painstaking detail. Our pain his detail. Things finally kick into gear when Pis family decides to move to Canada taking all their animals with them aboard a passenger ship. Suddenly there is a terrible storm and Pi ends up on a life raft with several animals including most notably a Bengal tiger. Easily two-thirds of ""Life of Pi"" takes place on that life boat as Pi tries to negotiate his relationship with an irritable and very hungry carnivore. Its an evolving relationship but one without much in the way of nuance and so for more than an hour the movie floats in place. There are compensations - a magnificent night sky the vast expanse of water and an island filled with nothing but meerkats. Meerkats are wonderful creatures tiny busy and watchful with a tendency to stand upright and with a perpetually stern expression that makes them look very concerned and extremely silly. Its a pleasure to see them in 3-D. There are other pleasures like that in ""Life of Pi"" all of them incidental all of them adding up to a movie that cant be dismissed because there is too much in it but cant be embraced because its all spread too thin.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.JUST WATCHEDAng Lees unusual Life of PiReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAng Lees unusual Life of Pi 0143Story highlights""Life of Pi"" is based on Yann Martels Man Booker prize-winning novelThe story centers on a young Indian boy named Piscine Molitor Patel and a tigerThe film is directed by Ang LeeThere are several reasons why Yann Martels Man Booker prize-winning novel ""Life of Pi"" was considered unfilmable when it was published in 2001. That most of the story takes place on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific Ocean surely didnt help. That the shipwrecked hero a young Indian boy named Piscine Molitor Patel -- ""Pi"" for short -- didnt have another human soul to talk to for 200 days presented another significant challenge. But the most glaring problem facing any aspiring filmmaker would have to be Richard Parker the full-grown 450-pound Bengal tiger who shares the lifeboat with Pi. Well its amazing what they can do with special effects these days Richard Parker is such a fabulous and fully realized creation perhaps nothing is unfilmable now? We dont usually think of ""Brokeback Mountain"" director Ang Lee as an effects filmmaker but he gave us the romantic swordplay above swaying bamboo forests in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and less happily ""Hulk"" bouncing across the desert like a rubber ball. Here hes embraced 3-D and its a masterstroke. The slightly artificial quality that comes with this technology -- even wearing the spectacles puts a barrier between the movie and reality -- complements Pis magical realist yarn and Claudio Mirandas luminous glossy color-saturated cinematography gives the movie a picture book look. No surprise really that 3-D is ideally suited to lunging tigers and pitching sea. But its more than that. In this story Pi must remain acutely aware of distance the distance between him and the big cat the restricted space of the lifeboat and the overwhelming open horizons of the ocean all around him. Underneath too. Some of the loveliest most magical images plunge beneath the surface to reveal the myriad marine creatures separated from Pi by nothing more than an inch or two of wood. And at night the water reflecting the deep glimmering stars. This is stereoscopic CGI image-making as pure visual poetry a demonstration of what the medium can do in the right hands that is worthy of comparison with ""Avatar"" and ""Hugo.""So how does Pi find himself in this unusual predicament? Thats prosaic in comparison and the first act is not quite as nimble as it might have been (theres a necessary framing device but also a redundant romantic interlude concocted by screenwriter David Magee for reasons that have more to do with conventional Hollywood wisdom than the demands of this particular tale). Its only when Pis world is turned upside down that the film really finds its sea legs. Interesting to note that the movie revises and pretty much demolishes the tiger-taming tips Martel came up with -- worth bearing in mind should you ever find yourself in close proximity to a man-eater for a prolonged period of time. The movies Pi (Suraj Sharma) is considerably more circumspect than the novels and understandably so -- Richard Parker is more ferocious in the flesh than he was on the page. The tension is welcome and also a discreet approach to violence which should make the movie accessible to children. Even then to his credit Ang Lee is never tempted to domesticate this cat except briefly when both boy and beast are starving and at deaths door. Its at this point that the movie conjures its most surreal and outlandish episode an alluring strange interlude on a floating island that doesnt quite catch the horror in the novels description. If this climax feels a shade hurried the poignant coda is written and acted with immense delicacy by Irrfan Khan and Rafe Spall. This transcendent fable carries a real sting in its tail. Ang Lee has made a bold and wondrous movie one of his best.

Based on the Man Booker Prize-winning novel by Canadas Yann Martel the film leaves its options open and hopes that our minds will be too.You may or may not leave a viewing of Life of Pi with an enhanced appreciation of mankinds delicate relationship with animals and nature. Your belief (or disbelief) in an all-powerful deity may be confirmed or quashed. Your definition of ""truth"" may need revising.But if you dont believe in Richard Parker and the role he plays in making Martels story leap from page to screen then Lee will have failed.He and his team dont leave anything to chance. The tiger is a seamless composite of a real animal (a feline named King) and a lot of magic pixels. Its one of the most marvelous special effects in recent memory all the more so because Lee insisted the animal not be the least bit cuddly. It is ferocious as wild animals tend to be.No less impressive are such wonders as the school of flying fish that zooms past the lifeboat carrying Richard Parker and his human companion Pi (Suraj Sharma). The fish seem to land in our laps thanks to 3D which for once doesnt seem like a gimmick.Claudio Mirandas luminous camera set to Mychael Dannas intoxicating score captures all manner of wild delights. The film opens with a montage of birds and beasts from hummingbirds to zebras leading into a story that links India with Canada. The montage inspires awe as does a later scene with meerkats on a remote island. And dont forget the elemental images the sleepy fat clouds mirrored on an unbroken sea during days of calm; the raging of wind and water during stormy times.As splendid as all this nature photography is it would seem like a National Geographic special without a good story to go along with it. And Martels shaggy cat tale finds excellent empathy in the hands of Lee and screenwriter David Magee (Finding Neverland).The film substitutes Montreal for the books Toronto the place where a middle-aged Pi (Irrfan Khan serene) is regaling a curious writer (Rafe Spall) with a saga the writer has heard ""would make me believe in God."" Pi explains not only his mathematical name (its actually a romantic reference to a French swimming pool) but also his fame how he came to Canada from India by way of a 227-day ordeal at sea in the company of a Bengal tiger.Flashbacks show Pis idyllic early days as the child of a zookeeper (Adil Hussain) in Pondicherry a distinctive place known as ""the French part of India."" Young Pi (Ayush Tandon) is more than open to experiences both corporeal and spiritual hes dangerously fascinated with the wild animals his father cares for and he embraces all manner of religion.When his Hindu father expresses dismay about his sons beliefs Pi argues that having multiple faiths means ""we get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just one.""Devotion to any kind of deity is put to the test when the family decides to emigrate to Canada by ship taking the zoo with it. A terrible storm leaves Pi adrift in a lifeboat alone except for a few terrified smaller animals (the law of the jungle soon takes hold) and one very large and ferocious tiger.The angry tabby is the aforementioned Richard Parker and the life-or-death task of 17-year-old Pi is to learn to share very limited space and resources with the beast.Much of the film concerns this fraught relationship and it requires us to believe not only in the realness of Richard Parker but in the mind heart and soul of Pi who is beautifully rendered by newcomer Suraj Sharma.Cautionary words from Pis father (""Hes an animal not a playmate"") blend with his own observations (""My fear of him keeps me alert"") as he negotiates a living arrangement that acts as metaphor for the eternal man/animal divide.Its the most remarkable relationship the Taiwanese-born Lee has yet brought to screen and this from a man who gave us the difficult unions of Brokeback Mountain Sense and Sensibility and Lust Caution.Like the book Life of Pi leaves us puzzling over what weve seen and heard. But never for a moment do we doubt the films expressive storytelling imagery and sense of wonder.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Life of Pi (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Life of Pi (PG) Lofty themes in a mesmerizing tale about a boy and a tiger Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | coglemiamiherald.com11/21/2012 Editor rating 3.5 Just like Yann Martels Man Booker Prize-winning novel Ang Lees Life of Pi works seamlessly on two levels. With grace imagination and stunning visual acuity it explores Martels twin themes of faith and the power of storytelling. Its also a thrilling action adventure shot in 3D so artful you may never again complain about the technique being wasted or employed only to raise ticket prices. The film centers on Pi Patel (Irrfan Khan The Amazing Spider-Man) who is telling his story of survival to a Toronto writer (Rafe Spall). This story Pi assures the writer will make him believe in God. Pi grew up in Pondicherry India where his family owned a zoo. Pis father is proudly nonreligious preferring the realities of science to the mysteries of faith but the notion of spirituality preoccupies young Pi (Ayush Tandon). He sets out to explore every religion open to a boy in Pondicherry which is how he becomes a Hindu-Catholic-Muslim much to the amusement of his family. Pi is equally fascinated by the pitiless ferocity of Richard Parker the zoos Bengal tiger (the big cat got his name from a paperwork mistake). Pi is smart enough to fear Richard Parker -- especially after his father forces a bloody lesson on him about the unsentimental brutality of nature -- but hes still intrigued by the idea of connecting with the tiger. Does Richard Parker have a soul? Or is he merely a predator destined only to kill to stay alive? Then Pis family decides to emigrate to Canada and boards a freighter with most of the animals which have been sold to zoos in North America. During a violent storm the boat sinks in a harrowing scene so intense it will leave you limp and wrung-out. The teenage Pi (Suraj Sharma) awakened by the noise of the wind and crumbling ship escapes in one of the life rafts with an injured zebra a hyena an orangutan -- and Richard Parker. How Pi survives on the raft with Richard Parker makes up the bulk of the film which follows the unlikely castaways as they float across the Pacific Ocean encountering wonder terror thirst starvation death compassion maybe even the hand of God himself. Life of Pi is a fable about belief to be sure but the way in which it deals with such lofty themes is immediate and never overly pedantic. Lee doesnt spend too much time allowing Pi to reflect on his situation. Instead he uses the elder Pis voiceover to put actions into perspective and paces his film with swift authority. This is a film that moves inexorably forward even as it jumps back and forth from past to present. Lee whose last film was the disappointing Taking Woodstock has excelled in the past at adapting films from fiction -- Brokeback Mountain Sense and Sensibility The Ice Storm -- and with the technology to make Life of Pi come alive now available he has created breathtaking visuals from the lush Pondicherry zoo to the open seas where boy and tiger alternately battle for power and co-exist in uneasy and short-lived truces. Not everything looks real exactly but the films more fantastical moments -- such as when Pis raft floats above an ocean glowing with phosphorescence -- mirror the fable-like nature of Martels story. Dont wait for Netflix. Life of Pi demands to be seen on the biggest screen you can find. As for the animals they are so flawlessly rendered you might be persuaded they were real if not for the insurance risks of putting young Sharma on a raft with an actual tiger. The fearsome Richard Parker looks no more like a CGI creation than the actor looks like a CGI boy. When Lee turns his camera on Richard Parkers eyes we look deep too to see whats inside. If there is no soul there at least there is one in this mesmerizing movie. Cast Irrfan Khan Suraj Sharma Rafe Spall Gerard Depardieu. Director Ang Lee. Screenwriter David Magee.

The dangerous animals look beautiful. The terrible storms look beautiful. The crashing ocean waves the twinkling stars the wondrous carnivorous island on which the hero at one point lands -- pure gorgeousness shimmering with all the wow that superlative 3-D technology has to offer. All that luster reflects how devoted director Ang Lee is to his latest undertaking an adaptation of Yann Martels best-seller about a 16-year-old Indian boy named Pi who survives a shipwreck and crosses the Pacific in a lifeboat. Pi does so alone -- except for the temporary company of a zebra an orangutan and a hyena and the ongoing companionship of a Royal Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. As millions of readers know the heros full name is Piscine Molitor Patel. His father owned a zoo and the whole family is emigrating (with all the animals) on a ship to Canada when disaster hits. Telling you this gives away nothing since in the screenplay by David Magee (Finding Neverland) the particulars are shared from the outset by the middle-aged Pi (a dignified gentle Irrfan Khan) who recounts his tale to a visitor in his home. (As that slack-jawed guest Rafe Spall wears a glazed expression of wonder seen in the close-up study of his little teeth -- which becomes a distraction.) As adult Pi spins his yarn we begin to see that it is mostly the story of a boy and a tiger in a boat for a long time. And about the fantastical things that happen throughout the boys ordeal. And about how the boy thinks about God while hes on that boat surrounded by endless water. (Raised a Hindu Pi also embraces Christianity and Islam; Martels book is nothing if not a cant-we-all-get-along prayer for religious tolerance.) The story is very nice. So is newcomer Suraj Sharma as the teenage Pi. But both he and the movie kept this viewer at a distance my spiritual self unroused. Watching the directors first 3-D project I found myself drifting off thinking ""How did Ang Lee make that CG tiger look so excellently tiger-y? How did he make the stars so twinkly?"" And then I thought ""Gee the director has worked so hard on this and so meticulously. What craftsmanship"" But thats not the same thing as being swept away. Martels bigger theme is about the narratives we all tell to keep ourselves afloat -- whoppers and prayers diversions and dreams. Lees bigger theme isnt God or survival but the awesome adventure of making the imaginary visible the adventure of making movies.

Fortunately this movie adaption fares better than the unfilmable Clout Atlas. By Peter Rainer Film critic November 21 2012 Save for later Saved Life of Pi stars Suraj Sharma. Courtesy of 20th Century Fox          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Published in 2001 Yann Martels Booker Prize-winning novel ""Life of Pi"" was instantly deemed unfilmable. And so like that other ""unfilmable"" novel ""Cloud Atlas"" it has of course been turned into a movie - with rather happier results.The reason for the trepidation is obvious Much of the action takes place on a 27-foot lifeboat inhabited by a teenage Indian boy and a 450-pound Bengal tiger. Since as one of the films producers has put it they didnt want their leading man eaten during production a team of CGI wizards have fashioned what must be the most realistic computer-generated animal ever seen.Ang Lee directing from a script by David Magee is extraordinarily versatile. ""The Ice Storm"" ""Sense and Sensibility"" ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" ""The Hulk"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" - the only common linkages here are Lees contemplative sensibility. In that sense the 3-D ""Life of Pi"" isnt all that much of a leap for Lee except technologically. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Theres plenty of downtime aboard that raft in which to dramatize the meaning of life not to mention how to avoid becoming tiger bait. The 50 best movies of all time Video 11-21-12 Life of Pi review Monitor Movie Guide Piscine or Pi as he dubs himself grows up in India in the paradisiacal former French colony of Pondicherry where his father operates a zoo. When hard times hit the decision is made to decamp to Canada and sell the animals but a violent storm upturns the cargo ship en route and all are lost - animals family - save Pi (played as a teenager by newcomer Suraj Sharma) and an orangutan a zebra a hyena and that tiger to whom Pi gives the name Richard Parker.The events leading up to the shipwreck have a light and cockeyed comic tone. Young Pi raised in a not-very-strict Hindu household tries his hand at Christianity and Islam as well. Hes an ecumenical free spirit who sees all religions as equally affirming. His survival skills owe something to his cloud-borne spiritedness. Without it he probably would not have lasted a day at sea.Lee uses the 3-D effects with gentle sophistication flying fish glowing jellyfish an island of meerkats a humpback whale swathed in plankton - all are luminously rendered. And yet after a while the sameness of Pis survivalist escapades and a certain touchy-feeliness in the voice-over narration (supplied by the adult Pi and played by the marvelous Irrfan Khan in a framing device) began to weigh on me. The huge success of the novel may have something to do with its extra-literary reputation as a book of wisdom a quasi-religious tome. (Sort of like ""The Little Prince."")Lee may in the end be too balanced a filmmaker to give ""Life of Pi"" the extra spin of lyric delirium it sorely needs. Its a sane movie about an essentially deranged situation. Grade B (Rated PG for emotional thematic content throughout and some scary action sequences and peril.)

Comments click to enlarge Life of Pi Rated PG  125 minutes  2012 Ang Lees signature style--tasteful measured and devoid of personality--translates surprisingly well to 3-D the unfussy deep-focus compositions draw you into the world of the story inviting you to explore different fields of playing space within the frame. The aesthetic is a good fit for this fairy tale (adapted from Yann Martels best-selling novel) in which an unlikely series of events leaves an Indian boy and a Bengal tiger stranded in a sailboat on the Pacific. The movie is engaging enough though all the best visuals have been lifted from more imaginative movies--Cast Away and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button being two of the more obvious points of reference. As always in Lees films the onscreen behavior seems more like a collection of Oscar-groping dramatic reflexes than any recognizable human experience.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Nov. 21 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Mar. 01 2013 646PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ang Lee Written by David Magee Starring Suraj Sharma Irrfan Khan Country USA Language English Every once in a long while the right director comes across the right project at just the right moment and things so often discordant fall into perfect harmony. The director has mastered the shiny technology the story needs - without that mastery the book could never make the transition from page to screen. Just as important the story offers the director the deeper themes he craves - without such depth the film could never make its own leap from entertainment to art. When this happens this rare confluence the cinematic bar seems to wiggle free from its fixed notch. And the bar gets raised along with our spirits because were reminded of how joyous movie-watching can be the sheer and transporting wonder. Suraj Sharma stars in Life of Pi AP video Video Life of Pi hits the big screen Film Life of Pi official trailer So it is with Ang Lee and Life of Pi.Yann Martels Booker-winning novel is itself a clever confluence of many elements Its a ripping lost-at-sea yarn; its a Kipling-esque fable about a boy and a tiger; its a tragic insurance report; its a meditation on reason versus religion psychology versus myth; and its a story about the nature of storytelling an exercise in magic realism where the magic competes with the realism over the question of belief. Thats a whole lot for one book and you would think way too much for one movie. Yet heres the marvel Lee doesnt just capture the novel; he enhances it. How?Two big reasons but more about that later. For now lets quickly summarize the narrative which unfolds in the memory of a wise man who endured. In his Montreal kitchen the middle-aged Pi (Irrfan Khan) recounts his strange tale to a writer-friend. He begins with his childhood in French India an impressionable boy living at the zoo managed by his unimpressionable father. He moves on to their planned emigration family and animals alike on board a Japanese freighter bound for Canada. But the ship sinks in a violent storm. Pi then a teenager finds sanctuary on a lifeboat where hes joined by the only other survivor Richard Parker in name a ferocious Bengal tiger in truth. He concludes with the denouement where investigators from the freighters insurance company query him in a Mexican hospital.Enter Lee whose resume points to a crucial pair of skills for the task. In Sense and Sensibility The Ice Storm and Brokeback Mountain he proved himself acutely sensitive to family dynamics and their underlying psychodrama. But in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon he flashed his visual flair and kinetic gifts. Quickly and efficiently then Lee is able to sketch the dynamics of the childhood section especially the quiet yet palpable tension between father and son. Entranced by all religious mythologies little Pi embraces an ultra-holy trinity of beliefs - Hinduism Christianity Islam theyve all got great stories to tell. By contrast Dad is a scientist and a rationalist. ""Why not start with reason?"" he argues and then feeding a terrified goat to the ravenous Bengal cat reasonably demonstrates to his delicate boy that ""A tiger is not your friend."" The lesson is learned and the themes are introduced - rather dramatically so is Richard Parker.Of course the sea tale is the extended centrepiece of the movie and thanks to Lees adroit handling of cinemas newest tools - for once technology is a slave to plot and not vice versa - these sequences explode off the screen. His use of 3-D is dazzling the best and most organic in any film to date. The storm Mountainous waves reach out to engulf us while underwater roiling currents writhe and seethe. The morning after In the dawns light the becalmed ocean is a vast mirror with white clouds dancing on its still surface. The days and weeks after Beguiling scene follows beguiling scene as the phosphorescent sea glows under moonbeams as whales breach and sharks circle and an entire air force of silver fish flies.And dont forget Richard Parker the virtual tiger. Here the paradox of computer-generated imagery precisely complements the thematic paradox in the novel - that magic makes for the most compelling realism or in the case of CGI that the wizardry of a wired computer makes for a really credible flesh-and-blood beast convincingly ferocious and undeniably scary but vulnerable and poignant too. Yet none of this would work without the human counterpoint to these technical marvels and this is where Suraj Sharma shines as Pi the survivalist. Perhaps because hes a neophyte actor theres a wide-eyed purity to his performance which makes him an ideal surrogate for the equally wide-eyed audience. Like us hes simultaneously trapped in and awed by the unfolding spectacle.The denouement as brisk as the prelude brings that spectacle back to earth again. There in the narrow eyes of the insurance investigators a fable cannot be a report a lifeboat cannot be an ark and Richard Parker certainly cannot be a tiger. So mythic drama gives way to psychological drama and the two stories compete for our belief. Embedded in the ending is a choice. But in the beginning was the word which as pronounced by the wise creator of tales promised a yarn that ""would make you believe in God."" Maybe maybe not but for those who pray at a lesser altar this much is sure Lifeof Pi will definitely restore your faith in the divine magic of the movies.

"Ang Lees Pi is a marvel - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Ang Lees Pi is a marvel Share Tweet Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 11.21.12 | 400 PM Ang Lees ""Life of Pi"" is a wonder of contradictions. Its a movie about the magnificence and danger of the natural world in which most of that ""nature"" has been created inside a computer. Its a globe-spanning visually rhapsodic epic about a mere two characters one human and one not. Its a 3-D extravaganza that mostly takes place inside a 20-foot boat. The film really shouldnt work at all. The last time a talented director tackled an ""unfilmable"" novel we got Peter Jacksons ""The Lovely Bones"" -- as complete a train wreck as can be imagined. But ""Life of Pi"" works or at least the part that matters does -- the long central section in which the young castaway Pi (played with earnest presence by newcomer Suraj Sharma) drifts across the Pacific Ocean in a lifeboat with a tiger whose name as a result of bureaucratic serendipity is Richard Parker. He is not a cuddly tiger and for much of the story he is very very hungry. The films about nothing less than mans smallness -- and resilience -- in the face of the animal appetites of existence. Related Links Find showtimes and theaters for Life of Pi Find showtimes and theaters for Life of Pi 3D (A side note and best to get it out of the way at the start As the many readers of Yann Martels 2001 bestseller know a zebra a hyena and an orangutan are also initially on the lifeboat after the ship -- carrying Pis family and the contents of their Pondicherry India zoo to a new life in Canada -- goes down in a raging storm. Those other animals dont last long. While the details arent as horrific as they are on the page theyre still grimly realistic enough to have caused cries of real distress in the younger members of the screening I attended while making a mockery of the MPAAs blunderbuss approach to movie ratings. Just so you know A PG does not automatically mean a family film. I repeat This is not a ""family film"" as the commercial movie industry understands the term. Older and more thoughtful kids will have their nerves tested and their sensibilities expanded -- as will their parents -- but you should seriously consider leaving the under-10s at home. Here endeth the lecture.) Advertisement - Continue Reading Below As in the book this fantastic tale of survival is framed by the older Pi (the fine actor Irrfan Khan his bearing more modestly weary than usual) narrating the story to a young British writer (Rafe Spall) in his Montreal living room. The setting is warm and mundane intentionally ordinary and it highlights the fable-like nature of Pis journey. Boy tiger boat sea It could be a passage out of Homer a chapter in the ""Arabian Nights"" a painting on a cave wall. As a filmmaker Lee seems to alternate between naturalism (""The Ice Storm"" ""Brokeback Mountain"") and rapturous otherworlds (""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" even 2008s ""Lust Caution""). Really hes just a master at creating unique cinematic planets and so it is here. Once were down to the hero and Richard Parker on the boat ""Life of Pi"" settles into a series of dazzling visual variations -- on ocean and aloneness reason and wildness mind and sinew -- using all the artifice that highly-paid digital craftsmanship can muster. There are sequences to astonish a sideways storm of flying fish a whale heaving up from a phosphorescent midnight sea a titanic second gale. Lee uses 3-D intelligently and inventively not so much to convey the vastness of the distant horizons as to dramatize the tight and ever-shifting playing field of the lifeboat. By the time the story beaches us temporarily on an island with eerie secrets its as though weve sailed right off the map. Here be monsters in other words. The moral of ""Life of Pi"" though -- and its as fuzzily articulated on the screen as in Martels novel -- is that the monsters of our waking world can be infinitely worse. Toward the end of the movie Pi tells the young writer an alternate version of what may have unfolded on the lifeboat -- this one delivered by the character directly to the camera without the fancy pixels -- and were invited to ask ourselves which version we prefer. Not ""believe"" but ""prefer"" and the distinction is critical. The book has strained ideas about spirituality with the young Pi dialing through the worlds major religions in search of meaning and a promise that his story has the power to make the young writer ""believe in God."" Perhaps. Martels message (Im guessing here) is that divine mercy can be found in the saving limitlessness of our imaginations but that seems an unexpectedly small prize to fall out of the Cracker Jack box of this story. Reducing ""Life of Pi"" to a homily does it a disservice. Lee gives the framing story short shrift and concentrates on visualizing the inner tale with as much detail and power as possible. Yes Richard Parker is a creature of computer animation (except for a handful of shots) but that lushness of detail every black and orange hair ruffling in the digital ocean breeze heightens the films sense of hypernatural clarity. If Martel puts his faith in human imagination Lee trusts in the machines that allow us to share one persons visions with a larger audience out there in the dark. ""Life of Pi"" even more so on the screen is a dream to help us keep the nightmares at bay. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A central plot point in Life Of Pi--the film adaptation of Yann Martels bestselling book--centers on the philosophical question of whether animals have souls. The title character a self-possessed Indian boy believes they do and that people can tell by looking deep into their eyes. His zookeeper father feels differently; in his opinion any depth in an animals eyes is just human emotion reflected back at the viewer. This conundrum--essentially the question of whether to interpret the world spiritually or cynically--becomes the backbone of the plot. But it also works into a choice that the characters present directly to the viewers about whether they want to take that plot literally or metaphorically whether to focus on the films body or accept its soul. The choice is harder than it was in Martels book because here the body is more compelling by far. Pi grows up in his fathers zoo until his father decides to sell the animals and move his family abroad. When their transport ship sinks Pi (played as a teenager by Suraj Sharma) ends up adrift at sea on a lifeboat populated by an assortment of animals including a full-grown Bengal tiger. Director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; Brokeback Mountain) executes all this with dizzying overwhelming verve The shipwreck in particular is a dazzling sequence particularly traumatic in 3-D and Lee stylizes a great deal of the more mundane storytelling as well. As with so much about Pi its strikingly beautiful but consciously artificial. And so is the meat of the story which has Sharma repeatedly desperately trying to come to terms with his lifeboat companion in some way that doesnt kill either of them. For much of the film the metaphors at work are largely submerged in the immediacy of Sharmas breathless intense fight for survival spaced out by moments of overwhelming visual richness provided by the changing environment around him. But the larger messages about spirituality often seem forced and its more compelling to focus on Lees visceral cinematic experience than on the larger fuzzier messages Martels story conveys about humanitys connection with God. The tigers soul might make for a deeper more compelling bit of fiction but Lee renders its body so lavishly and lovingly that its hard to get past that surface.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday November 21 2012 600 AM Title Life of Pi Film Info PG Mild violence shipwreck. Area theaters. In 3-D. Wrestling with spirituality onscreen can be exhausting even when it comes with historical insight (""Kundun"") thought-provoking questions (""A Serious Man"") or intriguing revisionism (""The Last Temptation of Christ""). The deeply effective eye-popping spiritual adventure film ""Life of Pi"" though winds up being wholly rewarding even as the toughest parts of its metaphorical journey are at its beginning and end. Director Ang Lees film from Yann Martels 2001 novel is told in flashback. A man named Piscine ""Pi"" Patel (Irrfan Khan) tells a writer friend a story he says will make him believe in God. After seeing Pis childhood as the son of a zoo owner in India we meet him as a teenager (played by Suraj Sharma) and the zoos carnivorous Bengal tiger named ""Richard Parker"" (hes given a human name due to a clerical error). As the family is transporting their animals by sea from India to Winnipeg Canada a storm sinks the ship to the ocean floor. Pis family most of their animals and the crew are drowned. But Pi not in his quarters at a crucial moment is able to hang onto a large lifeboat. He is not alone on it though. Richard Parker is there too as is a sickly orangutan and a vicious hyena. Natural instinct reduces their number to just two. Then comes a roundelay of predatory impulse and survival that is as exciting as anything on screens this year. First Pi takes refuge on a makeshift raft next to the boat then the tiger does then the two forge a wary co-existence together. There is a hallucinatory side trip but mostly Pi and the tiger spend months facing each other conquering fear and happening upon unexpected wonder. Though the films setup trudges and its closing is too pat that hour or so on the raft is something special and few would dive into the storys soul as Lee does. Working from a script by David Magee the ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" filmmaker grounds the film while reaching outward. The adult Pi says hes a man of all religions and the film maintains a similar interconnectedness. The movie features transformative 3-D visuals and a CGI tiger so beautiful tactile and lifelike its reality is never in doubt. But Lees greatest accomplishment is to blend his heros inner adventure with his external one. He keeps the parable simple without fearing larger poetic ideas.

Starring Suraj Sharma Irrfan Khan Adil Hussain Director Ang Lee Running time 207 Release Opened Nov 21 2012  Editorial Review A spellbinding 3-D journeyBy Ann HornadayWednesday November 21 2012In a year when 3-D has added little or nothing to the films it nominally enhanced (does anyone think ""Spider-Man"" needed an extra dimension?) ""Life of Pi"" arrives just in time to breathe life and possibility into an otherwise moribund marketing gimmick. By design this adaptation of Yann Martels 2003 novel takes viewers on an epic journey -- in this case the 200-day odyssey of its title character and his unconventional travel companion -- but it also plunges them into a story and the myriad sub-stories it contains. Like a lyrical extravagantly hued childrens pop-up book ""Life of Pi"" both draws the audience in and encourages it to settle back the better to enjoy its virtually nonstop display of daring wonder and cinematic virtuosity. If the story goes ""poof"" almost as soon as the covers close thats probably due to the depth of the source material rather than the movie itself. The story of Piscine Patel also known as Pi ""Life of Pi"" begins with an Edenic panorama of his youth which was spent in a small zoo run by his father in the cosmopolitan former French colony of Pondicherry India. (Pi is played as a youth by Ayush Tandon and as a teenager by Suraj Sharma.) In the languorous compound he shares with zebras flamingos hummingbirds and hippos Pi pursues an idyllic youth and adolescence the latter of which is spent discovering love reading Dostoevski questioning the existence of God and debating religion with his nonbelieving father. When the Patels decide to move to Canada taking the animals with them on a Japanese cargo ship the trip is interrupted by a ruinous storm resulting in Pi being thrown overboard his only salvation a lifeboat that he must share with the zoos ferocious Bengal tiger Richard Parker. Pis journey with Richard Parker forms the main spine of ""Life of Pi"" which director Ang Lee infuses with the graphic stylized boldness of illustration and moments of dazzling poetry and intimacy. Proving that digital 3-D photography need not sacrifice detail and brightness like it once did Lee re-imagines Martels story with a vibrant multicolored palette the images and staging suggesting a state-of-the art cinematic fairy tale rather than a whiz-bang technical achievement. The films fable-like quality is altogether appropriate for a movie that at its core interrogates the very notion of faith from Pis porous ecumenism to his cautiously hopeful detente with nature at its most threatening. As if that primal standoff isnt enough ""Life of Pi"" is intercut with a present-day story line in which an unnamed writer (Rafe Spall) listens to the tale being recounted by the grown-up Pi played by Irrfan Khan(familiar to ""In Treatment"" fans as Sunil) throwing the events into more question and giving the entire enterprise the feeling of a series of narrative nesting dolls. Viewers dont have to agree wholeheartedly with the films allegorical views on God and religion to surrender to the sheer beauty of ""Life of Pi"" which Lee deploys with rapturous extravagance from that early sequence set in the zoo to hallucinatory scenes of flying fish a nighttime starscape and phosphorescent jellyfish that Pi and Richard Parker encounter while adrift on the high seas. To be sure there are scenes of cruelty and terror in ""Life of Pi"" as well made all the more difficult by the filmmakers near-consistent refusal to anthropomorphize his four-legged subjects (this is after all a film that regards projection with skepticism). But for every wrenching moment there are sequences of unimaginable poetry mysticism and even magic. For the potency of its images ""Life of Pi"" has a strangely limited shelf life in the consciousness once its over. Perhaps its a reflection of just how good movies are this season -- from ""Argo"" and ""Lincoln"" to ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and ""Anna Karenina"" -- but for some reason theres an evanescent ""Well that happened"" aspect to this particular tall tale-slash-spectacle. Still ""Life of Pi"" is spellbinding while it lasts. Lees film can be appreciated as many things -- a post-Darwinian meditation on coexistence as the key to survival a reflection on the spiritual nature of suffering and transcendence a beguiling bait-and-switch on the vagaries of belief itself. Mostly though ""Life of Pi"" is a trip -- in every transporting liberating mind-bending sense of the word.Contains emotional thematic material throughout and some scary action sequences and peril.

Ang Lees ""Life of Pi"" is the best-looking film Ive seen this year and possibly so far this century. Its so hypnotically beautiful that people will be using it to calibrate their new TV monitors. Deploying 3-D more effectively than any movie since ""Avatar"" it boasts computer-generated effects especially a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker that are truly jaw-dropping. Part Indian travelogue part nature documentary part adventure and part multicultural religious allegory the fantastical and New Age-y ""Life of Pi"" is a family-friendly art film that like so much expensive Hollywood product these days seems to be aimed primarily at an international audience. To describe it in somewhat flippant (but not totally inaccurate) showbiz shorthand basically this is ""Cast Away"" in a lifeboat substituting a shipwrecked Indian teenager and Richard Parker for Tom Hanks and the volleyball he names Wilson. Suraj Sharma the 17-year-old newcomer who plays Pi(scine) Patel -- who is orphaned when a Japanese freighter taking his family to Canada goes down in a scary storm -- does a fine job and gets better as the film goes along. But even at his best Sharma doesnt have sufficient acting chops -- or enough Hanks-like charisma -- to hold the screen alone for more than 70 minutes with the CGI Richard Parker (as well as a zebra a hyena an orangutan and a rat who quickly become food for the ravenous tiger). We know from the outset that Pi will survive as the story is narrated as part of a series of whimsical flashbacks narrated by the middle-aged Pi (the soulful Indian actor Irrfan Khan). Hes relating his tale to a fictional version of author Yann Martel (Rafe Spall) who in real life turned ""Life of Pi"" into an international best seller. Another problem is that to keep the film safely in PG-rated territory its clear even before the shipwreck that no blood will be spilled. The camera discreetly pulls away when Pis dad demonstrates Richard Parkers carnivorous nature to his incautious son by feeding the tiger a live goat. A certain tedium inevitably begins to set in even as Pi sets out to train Richard Parker on the lifeboat with both of them struggling to survive for 227 days. And a sequence where this odd couple finds a brief respite on an island populated by meerkats seems like a concept that worked better on the printed page. ""Life of Pi"" certainly has lots of thrilling moments but even Lees best work -- ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" is the main exception -- tends to move at a pace thats relatively languorous even by American indie standards. Lee and his screenwriter David Magee straddle a fine line between magical realism and fantasy that may not go down all that well with American audiences drawn in by all that eye candy. Im comfortable with recommending ""Life of Pi"" as a spectacular visual experience -- the night scenes are especially stunning and I really wish this film were being offered on IMAX screens. But fair warning Theres a late twist that made me feel like the filmmakers pulled the rug out from under me.

Steven Freekinsaid on Thursday January 10 2013 55937 PMAng Lees Life of Pi was Jaw Dropping Eye Popping Heart Stomping Pulse Pounding Mind Blowing epic movie of the year Wow a great emotional and spiritual roller coaster ride like never before. Patrick Wellssaid on Wednesday December 19 2012 43900 AMTizzy calm yourself. While the ""liberal nut bag Democrat"" line was way overboard and extremely insulting Jim had a very good point before that and I say all of this as a ""nut bag"" Democrat ;). Too often nowadays we get comments like Justins where close minded people completely tune out stories with any religious or spiritual themes not realizing that spirituality is a universally important theme no matter what religion you belong to or if you are a theist or even atheist. Spirituality extends to exploration of the human condition and even religious themes can be viewed as metaphors for the everyday struggles that everyone goes through in this life. Its a shame that there are so many closed minded atheists these days who are so quick to tune out true artistry and themes and metaphors that could very well help them in their lives. Mathewsaid on Tuesday December 18 2012 100255 PMJustin I dont really see a reason for trepidation when it comes to the spiritual themes of the film. Especially since the conclusion made is inherently tied to the acceptance of these being stories and the nature of unreliable narrators. This is one of a very few films/novels that approaches spirituality and the place of religion in modern culture without a heavy hand and with a great deal of thought. Its a meditation and if anything concludes with a sentiment that is akin with Buddhism. Theres no threat here and Im someone who is extremely vigilant towards spiritual/religious themes leading art. This is philosophy and no way tied to dogma and a beautiful place to start a conversation. Tizzysaid on Sunday December 16 2012 111103 PMJim calm down. Youre making a fool of yourself. Justin is allowed to have his opinion without you spouting off like a crazy person and calling him a ""liberal nut bag Democrat"". Just so you know Im a Republican and people like you make me sick. Aron Toplitskysaid on Sunday December 09 2012 101519 PMRichard this is one of the best movies Ive seen in a long time Im the kind of guy who never gets teary eyes from a movie yet this film affected me. Jim Hackettsaid on Saturday December 08 2012 91550 PMJustin. So you must think that no story or movie should have any reference to any religion even if thats part of the story. Really. Jim Hackettsaid on Saturday December 08 2012 70936 PMJustin this a movie created and a story that has some religious content. Are you suggesting that because you may not believe in Catholic religion the Hindu or Muslim religions that no one can ever make a movie that refers to any religion. Obviously you are a liberal nut bag democrat that wants everyone to believe only what you want them to believe. God Bless you and enlighten you on your journey. Justin Hamakersaid on Wednesday November 21 2012 22348 AMI am very torn about Life of Pi. I found the story to be immensely interesting and the visuals are extraordinary. However I was turned off by the spiritual and religious themes of the movie. Still I would rather see movies like Life of Pi over another retread sequel or spinoff.

Cast Suraj Sharma Irrfan Khan Adil Hussain. Rating PG for emotional thematic content throughout and some scary action sequences and peril. RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Director Ang Lee on making Life of Pi By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Wed Nov 21 2012 126 PM Nine out of 10 times when someone says ""Youve never seen anything like this in a movie"" its bunk.Not so with ""Life of Pi."" Director Ang Lee has cracked the 3-D riddle in his film about a teenager trapped aboard a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger making the most of spectacular effects since a certain lesser movie that involved blue creatures and bad dialogue topped the all-time box-office record. (OK OK ""Avatar"" pretty much the definition of all hat and no cowboy when it comes to using effects in movies.)The look of the film is jaw-dropping at times beautiful to behold. If the story based on the popular novel by Yann Martel cant quite keep pace with the look of the film (and alas it cant) it will take you awhile to notice.Thats partly due to newcomer Suraj Sharma as Pi at least the version of him we see for much of the film. Hes captivating as a boy trying to survive but also to live up to his beliefs. As you know if youve read the novel Pi is trapped on a lifeboat with a massive Bengal tiger named Richard Parker one who is not shy about making a meal out of just about anything that moves (as we learn in graphic detail). Pi must learn to keep himself alive and given his spiritual nature keep Richard Parker alive too.A framing device in which the adult Pi tells his story to a writer might have been unnecessary if not for the performance of Irrfan Khan perfectly capturing the calm of a grown-up version of a boy who manages to become a Hindu Muslim and Christian. His faith will serve him well on the lifeboat and later in life.We first meet Pi as a boy (played by Ayush Tandon) in Pondicherry India where his parents own a zoo. They decide to move to Canada and travel on a boat that capsizes in a storm. Pi is a teenager by this time winding up in a lifeboat the only human survivor. A few other animals make it to the boat too but theres that tiger ...Pis journey is as much spiritual as anything else. By the end of the film that spirituality becomes a little heavy-handed though not off-putting.Whats striking about the film in addition to the effects is the calm with which Lee tells the story. Hes patient sure of himself at every turn and Sharma is the perfect choice for that sensibility. ""Life of Pi"" isnt the best movie youll see this year but itll certainly be the best-looking and something more besides. > Join the DiscussionView/Add Comments  >> Posting a comment to our website allows you to join in on the conversation.

"Review Life of Pi is a masterpiece by Ang Lee - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Life of Pi is a masterpiece by Ang LeeThe directors stunning use of 3-D the intriguing story of survival and the big issues it raises and Suraj Sharmas deft acting all add up.November 20 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Ang Lees ""Life of Pi"" asks that we take a leap of faith along with a boy named Pi Patel and a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker as an angry ocean and the ironies of fate set them adrift. Their struggle for survival is as elegant as it is epic with the director creating a grand adventure so cinematically bold and a spiritual voyage so quietly profound that if not for the risk to the castaways you might wish their passage from India would never end. There are always moral crosscurrents in Lees most provocative work but so magical and mystical is this parable its as if the filmmaker has found the philosophers stone.Yann Martels Man Booker Prize-winning novel on which the film is based constructed many trials for the 17-year-old Pi on his way to becoming a man. It is a richly drawn interior work much of it spent inside Pis mind or awash in his memories. Lee and screenwriter David Magee have managed to stay true to the source without being constrained by it as so often happens in adaptations. Indeed Lee has enhanced the novels power employing 3-D and CGI technology with such originality that there are moments when the ocean seems to float around you. And when a certain tiger roars you may well jump.As magnetic as Lees boundary-breaking visuals are that wouldnt be enough to carry the film if it were not anchored by such an electrifying tale. The core is the 227 days Pi spends in the lifeboat where the rational and the religious vie for his soul and the tiger for his life. But the film as the book did before it wants you to understand the complicated and conflicted species being examined here.GRAPHICA Tricks to turning pages into framesTo set up the existential quandaries to come the film uses a framing device only hinted at in the novel. A writer (Rafe Spall) has tracked down the 40ish Pi (Irrfan Khan) in Montreal because hes heard the shipwreck story might make a book. Their conversations weave the narrative together but the literalness of the writers presence in this otherwise lyrical film is its weakest link.Pi obliges the writer with Khan an excellent choice as narrator unlocking first the early days in Pondicherry India and the family-run zoo where he grew up. As the memories flow images of the zoo fill the screen. Giraffes tear at leaves pink flamingos high-step across a pond hippos play a sloth clings to a tree. It looks like a paradise and surely was one for the two Patel brothers Ravi and Piscine a a name that in grade school would become a taunt until a dramatic demonstration of the irrational number pi on the chalkboard stopped it. And so Pi he became (Ayush Tandon plays the 11-year-old). He is a curious boy equally interested in unraveling the enigma of God and the tiger Richard Parker. His father teaches him the tigers true nature in graphic fashion; God comes from the clerics of Hinduism Catholicism and Islam. Pi is ecumenical in his beliefs which becomes a thematic undercurrent in the film.Political shifts blow through Pondicherry like a bad wind and after a bit more back story a including Pis first love a the Patels and many of the animals are aboard a Japanese freighter headed for Canada with hopes of a better life. There are boys of varying ages cast in the title role but the Pi that matters most is 18-year-old newcomer Suraj Sharma who gives the character an emotional depth that matches the Mariana Trench where Pis world is torn asunder.VIDEO Life of Pi trailerFear becomes Pis first ally when a storm rips at the ship. The will to survive will kick in later. Hes thrown into one of the lifeboats and in the chaos that follows some of the zoos menagerie join him a a frantic zebra a fussy orangutan a frenzied hyena and Richard Parker who boards despite Pis best efforts to keep him at bay. Their face-off and the ambivalence Pi feels toward the beast a both drawn to him and fearing him a will be another recurring theme.You might think spending the bulk of a film in a lifeboat would soon lose its intrigue. But when there are wild animals unpredictable seas and diminishing rations there is no time for things to get boring. The strongest survive a nothing new there a but how it comes down to the final two and whether they will find a way through their considerable differences is where the film works its magic. At some point the situation demands that Pi come to terms with Richard Parker and God and this is where the film is at its lightest and darkest managing to keep the entertainment quotient on par with the esoteric. A floating island filled with meerkats accomplishes this in particularly fine fashion.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESLife of Pi Bill Westenhofer discusses tiger special...January 17 2013Ang Lee Suraj Sharma became each others lifeboat in PiDecember 17 2012Suraj Sharmas amazing turn of events in Ang Lees Life of...November 16 2012With Life of Pi Ang Lee devises a new mathSeptember 29 2012See the trailer for Life of Pi [Video]July 25 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowFilmNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-life-of-pi-review-ang-lee-20121121,0,902072.story",200,lifeofpi22,lifeofpi,latimes

Working with animals (even the CG variety) and children can also be rough going. Lee blithely faces these hurdles and still another shooting the movie in three dimensions.All these gambles pay off handsomely. Lees exquisite adaptation of Yann Martels 2001 best seller is a visual feast that leaves an indelible impression. Vibrantly rendered 3-D adds to the films otherworldly quality.STORY Ang Lee brings Life of Pi to the screenMORE Why Tobey Maguire didnt make the cutVIDEO Ang Lees moviemaking odysseyA teenage boy is stranded somewhere on the Pacific Ocean in a small lifeboat with a menacing tiger aboard. What could be more challenging -- for director and innocent main character?Lee is a master at epic filmmaking as beautifully illustrated in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. He is also brilliant at evoking emotional resonance as he demonstrated in Brokeback Mountain.Lee cast Suraj Sharma -- who is making his film debut -- in the lead role of teenage Pi Patel. Alone on the open sea for a good portion of the film Sharma proves to be a natural talent.Pi short for Piscine the French word for swimming pool was named by a father who loved all things aquatic though he never swam.Pi is fascinated by world religions and also the dangerous beauty of one of the animals in his familys Pondicherry zoo a tiger oddly named Richard Parker.When Pis parents decide to move -- along with their menagerie -- from India to Canada tragedy ensues. Their ship is caught in a powerful tempest featuring the most harrowing water-logged disaster scenes since Titanic.Scenes in which Pi struggles to survive on a storm-tossed sea are thoroughly riveting as are amazing underwater sequences in which the zoo animals struggle mightily. Pi somehow survives along with Richard Parker.During Pis long oceanic voyage the film is buoyantly riveting. Its a compelling personal odyssey of survival amid grandly spectacular vistas. A tentative bond between boy and hungry tiger seems oddly natural in this extreme storm-lashed setting.It is only in the storys expository framing device that the overall flow is marred. Interviews between an adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) and a struggling writer (Rafe Spall) come off plodding in comparison to the sumptuous adventure on the high seas. These passages work better as a literary device than a cinematic one.Otherwise Lee takes the best from Martells novel and blends religion and zoology (the adult Pis dual college majors) in artful ways. Pi encounters a captivating array of sea creatures while shipwrecked magnificent whales glorious flying fish and iridescent underwater life. He also cries out to God for deliverance.As mighty waves crash and even when the sea is nearly becalmed Life of Pi is a spectacular high-seas epic that employs technology brilliantly and underscores the power of a vividly told story.Life of Pi Clip Flying FishSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Pi (Suraj Sharma) and the tiger battle over the days catch. 84 CONNECTTWEET 6 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/UGgwz8,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/QmTcQSyMFqk/,200,lifeofpi23,lifeofpi,usatoday

Cool if youre talking goats and turtles; less cool if the animal you decide you want to pet is a Bengal tiger. ""Hes an animal not a playmate"" his terrified father shouts. ""Animals have souls"" the boy replies gently. ""I have seen it in their eyes."" Fast forward a few years and Pi will get a chance to test that theory when his family closes the zoo and is accompanying the animals on a sea voyage to their new home in Canada. A terrible storm swamps their freighter and it starts to sink. Thinking of the animals Pi races below deck to free them and sees zebras swimming past him. He barely manages to escape himself. As the freighter goes down he clings to debris fashioning a sort of raft so that he can survive a truly horrifying night. Then dawn comes and there appear to be no other survivors. Pi is relieved to spy an empty lifeboat nearby -- only to discover its not as empty as it looked. Thus begins a tale that on the page was widely viewed as part religious allegory part animal fable part rip-roaring adventure. Although theres talk of gods in a framing device -- because inquisitive Pi qualifies as a devout Hindu Christian and Muslim -- the challenge for director Ang Lee and his human star Suraj Sharma was to bring the adventure part to persuasive life. And do they ever finessing survival questions just as they occur to you and personalizing in intimate ways both boy and tiger. ""We were both raised in a zoo by the same master"" Pi murmurs to his fierce companion. ""Now we have been orphaned left to face our ultimate master together."" i Pi takes in the bioluminescent wonders of the sea. Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Twentieth Century Fox Pi takes in the bioluminescent wonders of the sea. Twentieth Century Fox Lee conjures exquisite images -- an underwater shot of the freighter going down a dense school of flying fish glinting in the sun phosphorescent jellyfish lighting up the night as a majestic whale surfaces inches from the boat. And of course theres that magnificent orange-and-black beast at the films center. Hes Ang Lees crouching tiger hidden digitizers as it were During filming there was often a boy on the boat and occasionally a tiger on the boat just not at the same time. But there isnt a single image of them together that youre likely to question while watching the film. The script I did question; it takes awhile to get going and it feels strangely flat at the very end. But in between Lee is very skillfully employing cinemas most advanced digital techniques in the service of an adventure yarn that is gloriously old-fashioned -- and often just glorious.

So its mystifying that this director--at ease among the po-faced quiet of closeted cowboys and forlorn martial artists--should turn up now at the helm of a gushingly spiritual survival tale one with the Oprah Winfrey stamp of approval. Life of Pi isnt a perfect match The story concerns an Indian teen (Suraj Sharma a high-energy find) who after having lived through a shipwreck that sweeps away his entire family and most of their zoo animals finds himself stranded on a lifeboat with a ferocious Bengal tiger. A few other creatures onboard dont last long and soon man and cat are squaring off over limited territory waiting for a weak moment. As with Yann Martels 2001 novel the movie bonks you over the head with symbolism the calm ocean becoming a mirror that reflects the essence of were-all-in-it-together mutuality and respect. But theres a completely different reason to applaud Lees evolution into an Avatar-style effects man His suspense sequences are fantastic. Apparently a Hitchcockian technician has waited patiently to emerge from the guy behind The Ice Storm; every rope-tugging stratagem of our hero and snarling swipe of the tiger is buffed to an ingenious sheen the sharks quietly swirling around them like spectators. The movie works on a bedrock level that many ostensible action films forget. Let New Age viewers in your crowd get misty-eyed--theres plenty here for anyone.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 429pm on Tuesday Nov. 20 2012 Tuesday Nov. 20 2012 Tuesday Nov. 20 2012 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Science and spirit technology and transcendence may sometimes be at war but in Life of Pi -- Ang Lees spectacular take on the popular Yann Martel novel -- they instead make for graceful dance partners.The story of a boy who finds his faith challenged after being stranded at sea with only wild animals for company is made stunningly real by the latest developments in computer graphics and 3-D cinematography. The result is that a story that many might have considered best kept on the printed page comes rapturously alive on screen.Life of Pi is told in flashback with the adult Piscine Molitor Patel (Irrfan Khan) an Indian immigrant living in Montreal recounting his incredible life to a dispirited author (Rafe Spall) on the hunt for something to write about. And the tale he tells is an unbelievable one.Back in India Patels idiosyncratic dad (Adil Hussain) not only had a touch of the poet in him -- naming his son after a Parisian swimming-pool complex the Piscine Molitor -- but also ran a small zoo. Life is pretty good for the Patels especially young Piscine (Suraj Sharma) who calls himself Pi. He is one of the most clever kids in his class and often wonders about the Big Questions. He declares at one point that hes Hindu Muslim and Christian much to the consternation of his Hindu mom nonbelieving dad and not particularly interested brother (Ayan Khan).Then Pis world is turned upside down when the family decides to move to Canada bringing their menagerie with them on what would be a slow tortuous journey across the Pacific. Tragedy strikes when a violent storm sinks the ship killing nearly everyone on board. Pi manages to make his way onto a lifeboat -- as do several of the animals including a Bengal tiger cheekily named Richard Parker a wounded zebra an orangutan and a snarling hyena in an especially bad mood (not that you can blame him).If handled badly this is when Life of Pi could have veered into silliness. But Lee along with scriptwriter David Magee (Finding Neverland) and cinematographer Claudio Miranda (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button TRON Legacy) manage to keep the fantastic credible.This is no Dr. Doolittle or Noah and his docile herds. With both the hyena and the tiger hungry and aggressive there are moments of dread panic and terror that may be too intense for some younger viewers. At this point you stop wondering whats real and whats CGI and start ducking.Yet there is beauty amid the isolation as well. When schools of fluorescent fish light up the sea underneath a weary Pi its a wondrous splash of visual splendor in a movie filled with them.Student-turned-actor Sharma in his first role deserves major kudos as he carries the entire movie on his slim shoulders having only animals God and green-screen technology to talk to through much of the film. Lee also should be congratulated for taking a long-gestating project (director M. Night Shyamalan was once supposed to make it) and using a cast of unknowns despite the pressure of having to have star power in a big-budget Hollywood movie. (Lee did shoot scenes with Tobey Maguire as the writer but cut them and reportedly purposely recast the part with someone less famous.)Exactly what happened to Pi on his misadventure and how it affected him may make for lively discussion around the turkey this holiday season. But there should be no argument that Lee has made one of the years most impressive films.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Less romantic is Pis father a zookeeper. ""What youre seeing"" he counters ""are your own emotions reflected back at you."" Either way theres something thrillingly alive inside that tiger even though hes largely generated by motion-capture animation. That process continues to advance beyond early experiments like ""The Polar Express"" and this majestic animal -- arguably the star of the film -- has an almost palpable warmth. Youd never guess that among his creators is the studio Rhythm and Hues which also gave us the Geico gecko.

Pi Patel (played as a young man by Suraj Sharma an appealing first-timer) calls the tiger Richard Parker (its a clerical mix-up that stuck) and the two will soon become closely acquainted. After their cruise ship to America sinks in a massive storm they must share a tiny lifeboat. What follows is a tale of bare-bones survival but also Pis attempt to find meaning and beauty beyond mere animal existence. Directed by Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain"") and based on Yann Martels novel ""Life of Pi"" is an absolutely gorgeous movie aglow with color and filled with wraparound 3-D effects. At times though the whimsical visuals trivialize the knotty parable at this films center which slowly emerges as an older Pi (Irrfan Khan) tells his unlikely story to an unnamed visitor (Rafe Spall). There are many mysteries here but Lee seems unwilling to let them linger preferring instead to wrap them up simply and sweetly. ""Life of Pi"" doesnt pack the cosmic punch it could. But its wonderful to look at and theres more to it than meets the eye. 217 VideoTrailer Life of Pi PLOT A young man is stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Suraj Sharma Irrfan Khan Rafe Spall LENGTH 206 BOTTOM LINE That motion-capture tiger is a thing of beauty and so is this entire film.

Life of Pi Life of Pi an absorbing adventure By Calvin Wilson calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com314-340-8346 Calvin Wilson Nov 20 2012 (...) 20th Century Fox Suraj Sharma stars as Pi Patel in ""Life of Pi."" Richard Parker sounds like the name of an investment banker clad in a sleek suit and carrying an expensive attache case. Its a highly unlikely moniker for the tiger to whom it belongs yet somehow it fits. His purposeful no-nonsense stride is among the more striking features of ""Life of Pi"" a film that might just as easily have been named for the tiger as for the character who idolizes him.That character Pi -- a zookeepers son played as a young man by Suraj Sharma -- is certain that theres more to Richard Parker than a creature driven by instinct. Looking in the tigers eyes Pi senses a connection. But can the feeling possibly be mutual?Pi and Richard Parker get the opportunity to know each other a lot better when a storm at sea makes them unwilling companions. As they float along on a lifeboat Pi is all too aware that hed make a great meal for the tiger. And Richard Parker is no doubt thinking the same thing. Based on the novel by Yann Martel ""Life of Pi"" is at its most absorbing once it leaves civilization behind and focuses on the title characters struggle to survive. In that regard it recalls ""Cast Away"" the 2000 film that starred Tom Hanks as a thoroughly modern American stranded on a remote island. Working from a screenplay by David Magee director Ang Lee (""Brokeback Mountain"") takes advantage of 3-D technology to create an experience at once epic and intimate. This has to be one of the most vivid films in memory.But it wouldnt work as wonderfully without Sharma who imbues Pis setbacks and successes with breathtaking immediacy. His performance contributes to a poignancy often missing in 3-D extravaganzas.

Its no shock that Ang Lee brings to his high seas adventure graceful and refined aesthetics devoid of any unique signature or pressing emotion as the director has long since proved himself to be a skillful big-studio craftsman without an imprimatur to call his own. Here that anonymity results in slavish proficient devotion to his source material Yann Martels 2001 novel.The story concerns the religious upbringing of Pi (newcomer Suraj Sharma) in India his unbelievable experiences surviving a shipwreck aboard a life raft also occupied by an enormous Bengal tiger and his post-rescue efforts to convince Japanese officials that his tale is true--a three-part structure thats framed by the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) recounting his tale to the nameless Writer (Rafe Spall). A struggling Caucasian American novelist who has been told that Pis saga will convince him of Gods existence the Writer--who looks like he just came from a Banana Republic modeling shoot--is a colonialist appropriator of Pis story which he plans to turn into his own novel. Lee however ignores such thorny sociopolitical dynamics opting instead to couch this framework as merely further proof of the divine magic of storytelling.That last message is during the finale spelled out with head-smacking literalness by the adult Pi who as embodied by Khan delivers every line like its more important than the last. Yet before it reaches that apex of obviousness Life of Pi first concentrates on its protagonists youthful search for the Almighty. That path takes him to his parents Hinduism then to Christ and finally to Allah (he also tells the Writer that he teaches some Judaism seemingly to assuage any suspicions of anti-Semitism) and finds that faith need not be confined to one strict dogma.Film Details Life of Pi RatingPG GenreAction/Adventure Running Time126 More Info When his zoo operator father (Adil Hussain) decries this behavior as a sign of indecisiveness rather than open-mindedness the sentiment rings starkly true but as Lees film is first and foremost a pantheistic creature interested in championing a vague brand of devotion Pi is never portrayed as anything less than a darling admirable little holy man. That comes to a head when Pi attempts to feed dads giant tiger--named oh-so adorably Richard Parker--and is scolded for not recognizing that beasts are wild and have no souls. Pi refuses to believe that even once the Canada-bound ocean liner that he and his family are on sinks and Pi finds himself joined on a small rowboat with a wounded zebra a kindly orangutan a nasty hyena and ferocious Parker.Lee stages the freighters demise with a thrilling immediacy taking full advantage of 3-D and culminates with a shot of an underwater Pi gazing at the vessel as it descends to the bottom its lights twinkling like flickering eyes. The moment boasts a stunningly beautiful multidimensionality.Such flair becomes more overt during Pis time with Parker out in the vast blue nowhere a middle section that Lee stages with intensity aided in part by animal CG that never feels artificial or corny. Flesh-and-blood Sharmas performance isnt quite as adept though his evocation of Pis fears of death and determination to endure is sturdy enough for the characters plight to feel emotionally genuine if not dramatically tense. Because the films structure makes clear that Pi survives this ordeal his contentious rapport with Richard Parker feels like a strained Jungle Book-ish metaphor. Lees imagery props up this action delighting with rhapsodic colors overblown foreground/background contrasts and luxurious computer-generated visions including the appearance of a humpback whale leaping against a starry expanse that has the sort of overblown glowing majesty fit for a dorm rooms black-light-enhanced velvet wall tapestry.Alas though one can sometimes sink into Life of Pi on a sensory level the storys relentless articulation of its thematic aims proves a buzz kill. The nadir comes in the homestretch when Pis story is met with disbelief by his rescuers and in order to satisfy their bureaucratic perspectives he concocts a tamer version of events He was trapped on the boat with a wounded sailor a murderous cook and his mother. The make-you-go-hmm point of this last passage according to adult Pi is that because neither account changes the basic facts (regardless the ship sank his family died and he survived) the particulars are unimportant--and thus like the Bible one should always choose to believe in the ""better story.""Because Lee doesnt dramatize Pis human-counterpart report however its tough for viewers to determine which is ""better."" Through its melodramatic underlined-meaningful final conversations between Pi and the Writer the film spoon-feeds rather than enlightens.

"Life of Pi movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Sea changes in Life of Pi   Ang Lee deploys a boatload of CGI 3-D to bring Yann Martels fanciful novel to lifeNovember 20 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie critic""Life of Pi"" Yann Martels beautiful little book about a young man and the sea and a tiger has transformed into a big imposing and often lovely 3-D experience. If the results are less about poetry and wonder than the digital and cinematic engineering designed to evoke those things with this story -- so very very unlikely to succeed in any other medium -- ""good"" is achievement enough.The guiding hand belongs to Ang Lee a director of versatile tastes catlike patience and a restrained sort of showmanship. Already much attention has been paid to the computer-generated Bengal tiger and its lifelike yet dimensionally expressive qualities. The cat a deadly beauty goes by the name Richard Parker formerly a resident of the Pondicherry India zoo where young Piscine Militor Patel self-nicknamed Pi has grown up among all sorts of animals.At age 17 the spiritually inclined Pi sets sail with his family on a Japanese freighter across the Pacific for Canada accompanying a slew of zoo creatures being sold to North American zoos. Terrible weather. The cargo ship sinks. Many die -- all in fact except Pi and the fearsome Richard Parker along with a zebra a hyena an orangutan and a few bugs. The young man clings to life in his uneasily shared 26-foot lifeboat. And the adventures and astonishments keep on coming.For a while the story suggests a tightly confined interspecies version of ""And Then There Were None."" Working from a script shrewdly adapted (though radically toned down in its protagonists religious quests) by David Magee Lee proceeds through Martels tall tale with an eye toward making the worst of what happens (beast-on-beast violence and snacking and more) a matter of suggestion or elision. At the same time Lee makes effective ""gotcha"" use of the 3-D format saving the gotchas for two or three key alarming points in the story.Some of the sights are splendidly realized notably a flying-fish sequence that spells lifesaving sustenance for Pi and Richard Parker as well as a genuinely accomplished use of digital effects technology. The ocean at night in the blinding midday sun a windless glassy mirror one minute a hellacious stormy nightmare the next Working with his cinematographer Claudio Miranda Lee creates a visual palette disinterested in documentary realism. This film is after slightly overbright and unrealistic vibrancy in addition to the biggest whale youve ever seen and a mysterious island to rival anything in ""Mysterious Island."" The tiger may not be a living breathing tiger but the digital creation thereof makes for the most persuasive purr and growl in a lifeboat since Tallulah Bankhead met Alfred Hitchcock.I admire the film a great deal which isnt the same as falling for it hook line and sinker. The young actor playing the teenage Pi Suraj Sharma is perfectly fine but an hour or two after seeing ""Life of Pi"" his performance was already lost in the waves of the films other more obviously formidable selling points. It wouldve been nearly impossible (and certainly for the humans extremely dangerous) to film ""Life of Pi"" without a surfeit of digital trickery.But in order to figure out why I liked the film without loving it I went back to one of my favorite human/animal adventure films Carroll Ballards exquisite ""The Black Stallion."" And there I was lost all over again in the island sequences between young Kelly Reno and the horse. Nothing in ""Life of Pi"" is dull or sloppy but the storys breathing room -- despite all that vastness and all those days and weeks on the water -- is scarce indeed.Lee brings serious craftsmanship and dramatic clarity to ""Life of Pi"" along with a near-constant deployment of 21st-century digital wow This is why the film works and why audiences I suspect will devour it the way they devoured Martels prose much as a starving hyena tears into an unfortunate zebra to name one grisly yet discreet depiction in ""Life of Pi"" -- discreet enough to retain a PG rating.mjphillipstribune.comLife of Pi -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG (for emotional thematic content throughout and some scary action sequences and peril).Running time 206Opens Wednesday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesAng Lee wins second directing Oscar for Life of PiFebruary 24 2013Ang Lee talks about risks and spirituality of ""Life of Pi""November 23 2012Ang Lees Life of Pi in 3D opens NY film festivalSeptember 28 2012Ang Lees ""Life of Pi"" in 3D opens NY film festivalSeptember 28 2012A perilous journey for Life of Pi director Ang LeeNovember 16 2012Find More Stories AboutAng LeeYann MartelSuraj SharmaTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1119-life-of-pi-20121121,0,5033539.column",200,lifeofpi30,lifeofpi,chicagotribune

Celebrities Who Have Left Scientology Life of Pi Life of Pi Credit Rhythm amp; Hues By Peter Travers November 20 2012 More News Travers Life Of Pi Is a 3D Masterpiece All Stories >> Yann Martels 2001 book a bestseller that has since morphed into a passionate global cult concerns an Indian boy trapped for 227 days at sea in a lifeboat with a starving Bengal tiger. How do you transform the literal and metaphorical sides of the tale into cinema? You call Ang Lee the Oscar-winning director of Brokeback Mountain who turns the book into a magnificent and moving film. Lees use of 3D to tell the story is absolutely thrilling. Like Hugo from Martin Scorsese Life of Pi puts 3D in the hands of a worldclass film artist. Lee uses 3D with the delicacy and lyricism of a poet. You dont just watch this movie you live it. More News Travers Life Of Pi Is a 3D Masterpiece All Stories >> Every sight and sound is astounding especially when you consider that the tiger is a digital creation. That puts enormous pressure on the actor who must react to a beast that isnt there. To play Pi Lee chose the inexperienced Suraj Sharma then 17 who returns the favor by giving a fine fearless performance that consistently rings true. Pis journey is perilous from the moment his zookeeper parents (Adil Hussain and Tabu) leave the serenity of their lives in Pondicherry India and board a ship to Canada to start a new life. Pi who claims to be Hindu Christian and Muslim finds his faith tested when the ship goes down - in a scene of beauty and terror - drowning everyone but Pi a zebra an orangutan a shrieking hyena and the tiger named Richard Parker for the hunter who captured him. Sharing one lifeboat reminds Pi of a lesson he learned on land about the mistake of treating a wild animal as human. The code of survival of the fittest leaves Richard Parker alone on the lifeboat forcing Pi to shift for himself on a raft he ties alongside. Working from a fluid script by David Magee (Finding Neverland) Lee frames the film with the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) telling his story to a Canadian writer (Rafe Spall). Khan (Slumdog Millionaire The Namesake) is a supremely gifted actor who uses his expressive eyes to suggest a haunting and brutal alternative to what we are seeing. His presence is crucial in this PG-rated film that shields a family audience from the full extent of Pis torment. And yet Lee with the indispensable help of cinematographer Claudio Miranda invades the mind through eyes that are dazzled.

Fox/Rhythm amp; Hues The typical thing about an Ang Lee movie is that theres no such thing as a typical Ang Lee movie. His first few small films -- particularly the breakthrough ""The Wedding Banquet"" -- focused on family. Then ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" exploded with martial-arts magic. And ""Brokeback Mountain"" told its own quietly tragic love story. Hes a director whos made films about 1970s suburban adultery Civil War atrocities Woodstock and the Hulk. So please dont waste time making any assumptions about his new ""Life of Pi."" Except assume that like everything he does its going to be carefully thought out beautifully shot and full of emotion. Based on the magical best-seller ""Life of Pi"" is the story of an Indian teenager traveling on a Canada-bound freighter with his family -- and his familys zoo. The ship sinks in a catastrophic storm and the boy just manages to swim to a lifeboat. Then a Bengal tiger clambers in after him. Their journey together is many things. A bit of William Blake certainly. Also Job as the boy -- Pi -- rails at the heavens. Mostly though its an examination of faith as the boy (who embraces Catholicism Hinduism and Islam alike and will probably get to Judaism and Buddhism eventually too) looks for a purpose in all this. His questioning is part of an interesting trend this year in which films flirt with the mystic (but cant quite commit to the divine). Like ""Flight"" like ""Cloud Atlas"" ""Life of Pi"" suggests that there are no true accidents in our sometimes sad and cluttered lives -- just grand designs it takes a while for us to understand. Yet Who or What might be behind those designs -- thats something the films are reluctant to name. That can be a tricky artistic approach both for secular audiences who dont believe awful disasters are part of some cosmic plan (why couldnt Providence simply not have sunk that freighter in the first place?) and devout ones who wish the films would just come out of the closet and declare an old-fashioned belief in God. But however wishy-washy the storys theology may sometimes be Lees mastery of imagery is superb as he effortlessly shows off what technology means in the hands of a true artist. Apart from one or two dodgy shots of meerkats the computer-generated images are both realistic and heightened. And the 3-D really does add an extra dimension as Lee plays with depth and reflections to make swimmers appear as if theyre diving into a clear-blue sky or floating across an inky universe of stars. Lee is working with a directors worst fears here -- an untried young actor (the very good Suraj Sharma) a wild animal (though computer-animated) and the roiling sea. Yet he manages all three (while adding 3-D just so he can juggle an extra ball). And he never takes his eye off the real points of the story which are first a belief in the need to submit oneself to the caprices of an unknowable force -- whether you call it God or life itself -- and to accept them. And second a realization that any story you tell yourself afterward to explain what happened is just that a story. Still as different as ""Life of Pi"" is from Lees other works its of a piece with them. Like ""The Wedding Banquet"" its about the lessons imparted from father to son. Like ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Lust Caution"" its about huge inescapable emotions that can wash over us like waves. Like the much-maligned ""Hulk"" its about breaking long-standing visual rules and using the screen in different ways. And like everything he does its about getting it right. And making it beautiful.

By David Denby Lifeboat Suraj Sharma and the tiger in Ang Lees movie.   Credit Illustration by Victo Ngai The four-hundred-and-fifty-pound Bengal tiger that appears in Ang Lees ""Life of Pi"" is of course a digital beast. You cannot train a tiger to act although the great Stella Adler did a good job with Marlon Brando. In ""Pi"" the re-created cat is fast beautiful and hungry. Fearful symmetry indeed. Hes palpable enough--snarling and frightening except when hes half-dying of thirst. The centerpiece of Lees adaptation of Yann Martels prize-winning 2001 novel is a long confrontation on a lifeboat between the tiger and a teen-age Indian boy named Pi (Suraj Sharma) which turns into a wary cohabitation. The story is improbable (were meant to see it as a fable even as we watch it) but Lee has filmed it with so much moment-by-moment physical detail and so bounteous a celebration of the natural world that ""Life of Pi"" becomes one of the great adventure films. You cant fight the kind of overwhelming sensuous feast that is possible only in the cinema; you just let it sweep you away as the yawning chasms and purple-and-green forests of ""Avatar"" did. It takes a while however for ""Life of Pi"" to reach that level of enchantment. Lee is a generous intelligent and patient director and he has made some wonderful movies including ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" But I wondered during the longueurs of his previous two films--""Lust Caution"" and ""Taking Woodstock""--if his narrative sense wasnt failing. ""Taking Woodstock"" just felt slight but the red-and-ebony Shanghai spy movie ""Lust Caution"" was a lamentable case a great idea but filled with pointless elaboration and unnecessary sequences. In ""Pi"" Lee is if anything too patient too faithful to his source. He holds to Martels metafictional frame. In Montreal a young uninspired novelist (Rafe Spall) begins a conversation with the now middle-aged Pi (Irrfan Khan) an emigre who teaches religion and says that he once had an astounding adventure. The professor talks the novelist listens and the movie slowly gets going. We see Pis boyhood in the city of Pondicherry on the Bay of Bengal which was formerly a French colony. Pi was a bold youth and an experimenter who was almost promiscuous in his religious appetites--he was born a Hindu but took up Christianity and then Islam. His tough father--the essence of this-world realism--disapproved of his sons curiosity. His mother fed his imagination his love of stories and beauty. This part of the movie is sweet-tempered but overly methodical even ponderous a product of Lees determination to pay utmost respect to a culture different from the ones he knows in Taiwan and America. (Lee wants to honor Martels tone as well as his narrative strategy but perhaps filmmakers should stop using India as a source of higher spirituality--its a genteel form of exploitation and one thats increasingly misleading. Where is the surging high-tech entrepreneurial nation of the past twenty years?) Pis family owns a zoo and decides to move with some of the animals to Canada and at last the movie proper arrives. On the journey across the Pacific the old Japanese freighter carrying them is wrecked in a storm. The animals washed out of the hold flail around in the tumultuous seas. Pi falls into a lifeboat where he is joined by a wounded zebra an orangutan a hyena and popping out from beneath a canvas covering a tiger who owing to a clerical error is called Richard Parker. ""Welcome to Pis Ark"" the boy exclaims but the group is less a peaceable kingdom sailing toward rebirth than a bunch of irregulars locked in a remorseless struggle for survival. Soon enough Pi and Richard Parker are the only passengers left on board. As the animal sleeps Pi makes a small raft which he attaches to the boat by a rope. He sometimes camps out on the raft which is dangerous but less dangerous than a tigers jaws. The movie becomes a survivalist mini-epic in the spirit of ""Robinson Crusoe."" Desperate ingenuity and sheer reflex lead to one memorable scene after another such as when a stowaway rat crawls into Pis hair and he flings it at Richard Parker who catches it with his teeth and swallows it in one gulp. This central part of the movie is perfectly paced; Lee alternates periods of sleep and calculation with frantic activity including another big storm and Pis improvised attempts to stave off Richard Parker with whatever he has at hand--a spar a knife a nervous spray of urine to mark his turf. Throughout the ocean scenes have a glowing magical look. We accept that Lee has gone past strict realism that hes heightened the beauty and the strangeness of the South Pacific. The boat is bombarded by hundreds of flying fish and surrounded by bioluminescent creatures that undulate in the water at night like candles in a procession. Suraj Sharma--a Delhi schoolboy who has never acted before--has a handsome face large expressive eyes and an easy way with the camera; hes intensely sympathetic. He decides that he must learn to live with Richard Parker so he trains the beast with lumps of fish and a whistle that he finds in the boat. By keeping the tiger alive he will concentrate enough to keep himself alive. The movies great triumph is that Lee and his technicians never anthropomorphize the animal. This is no sentimental boy-meets-big-cat story. Richard Parker is a member of a different species; hes not interested in affectionate ties with a skinny teen-ager who has kept him from dying. Thats a genuine and bracing insight. But I could have done without the boys search for God and other mighty significances. Secularist audiences in general have trouble with ""quest"" movies and literature (Hermann Hesse Paulo Coelho) in which a single meaning is somehow to be sought and wrested from the teeming universe. There are many searches many meanings most of them partial. As Wallace Shawn said thirty years ago in ""My Dinner with Andre"" something no more miraculous than a cup of coffee is enough transcendence for one day. ""Life of Pi"" at its best celebrates the idiosyncratic wonders and dangers of raw ravaging nature and Lee wrings more than enough meaning from the excitement of that spectacle; we need nothing higher. David O. Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is pretty much a miscalculation from beginning to end. Russells hero is a young history teacher Pat (Bradley Cooper) who is released from a Baltimore hospital after eight months of treatment for bipolar disorder. At home with his parents in Philadelphia he talks non-stop about his wife who has left him. In the middle of the night he breaks a window by throwing a copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"" through it then wakes up Mom and Dad to complain about the books plot. Im not quarrelling with his literary judgment (he might have disposed of ""The Old Man and the Sea"" too) but the trouble is that Pat isnt much more than a manic self-absorbed chatterbox. Whats supposed to be clinically wrong with him as a man is inseparable from what is merely infantile in him as a character. Were not much interested in Pat--he doesnt have an idea in his head just a lot of words--and Bradley Cooper goes at the part with burning eyes and great speeding rants. Russell doubles down on the noise by making Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) an obsessive too. Hes a furiously superstitious sports nut who makes wild bets on games and is always in a foul temper. As Pats mother (Jacki Weaver) tries to keep the peace every family scene turns into a fight. Russell made a good satirical comedy--""Flirting with Disaster"" (1996)--in which the babble of self-conscious people was buoyantly funny. But ""Playbook"" just feels worked up--an exercise in which actors can blow off steam. The crowded family living room resembles a coop with outraged chickens pecking for an advantage. Russell adds to Pats complications with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a young widow from the neighborhood. Tiffany is demanding needy and abrupt but also smart and she throws Pat off his monomaniacal rhythm. She chases after him hugs him then hauls off and smacks him across the face. Tiffany may be a little strange though we dont believe her for a second when she says that in her grief she ""had sex with everyone in my office."" Lawrence is tough and proud and always plays strong and the remark doesnt track with anything we see onscreen. ""Playbook"" turns into a stuttering romantic comedy of sorts. Pat keeps talking in his head to his wife (who is barely in the movie) and we irritably wait for him to notice that the woman whos attracted to him with her smoky voice sapling body and fierce directness is worth the trouble to any man sane or otherwise.

Director Ang Lee proves doubters wrong.  |  out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune November 21 2012 -- 327pm Video (3629)  ""Life of Pi"" ""Anna Karenina"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" get rave reviews from Star Tribune movie critic Colin Covert. Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Piscine Molitor Patel has a tiger by the tail. The zookeepers son has just survived the sinking of a freighter containing his familys menagerie when another castaway struggles aboard the lifeboat. Its a full-grown Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Can they follow the currents across the Pacific to land? Can 16-year-old Pi find the courage intelligence and cunning to survive until they do? ""Life of Pi"" the 2001 bestseller by Yann Martel made this saga of loss struggle faith and self-discovery into a publishing phenomenon but its wayward plot grand themes and claustrophobic scope seemed to doom any efforts to put it onscreen. Now it has been done triumphantly. Ang Lees thrillingly audacious film transforms this inconceivable premise into visual poetry high adventure and sheer enchantment. With digital effects of unsurpassed brilliance it compels us to believe that the tiger is a living breathing beast. The ocean scenes sometimes computer-created sometimes shot on an immense wave tank merge seamlessly. The beautifully composed 3-D cinematography by Claudio Miranda (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") draws us into Pis world as if by magnetic force. Yet the production is never about film magic for its own sake. Each scene advances the story and deepens Pis character building toward a climax of intellectual and spiritual elation. Lee is one of our greatest humanist filmmakers and this is the film he was born to make. The mystical/theatrical exuberance of ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" the deep personal drama of ""The Ice Storm"" and the special-effects focus of ""Hulk"" were the ideal proving grounds for ""Pi"" which must succeed on all three levels if it is to work at all. Lee directs with breathless ingenuity guiding his star first-time actor Suraj Sharma to a performance of unaffected authenticity and charm. The superb Irrfan Khan (""Slumdog Millionaire"") carries much of the film as the adult Pi. As he tells the fantastic tale to a nameless writer (Rafe Spall) he is utterly properly matter-of-fact. If he had narrated with a twinkle in his eye this modern fairy tale would have drifted into whimsy. The film was shot chronologically so Sharma could shed weight throughout Pis ordeal. In the latter scenes where hunger exhaustion loneliness lunacy and despair fill Pis head with surreal visions Sharma looks genuinely ecstatic. Anyone who shares his journey will be equally captivated. . Suraj Sharma stars as the title character in ""Life of Pi.""

Call the boy Pi and the Bengal tiger Richard Parker trap them on a small lifeboat in unchartered Pacific waters set up a boy-vs.-beast battle for territory and survival and you have the essence of Yann Martels Life of Pi winner of the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 2002. No question its a (literally) ripping yarn full of desperation heroism and a certain spectral awe. But what director would be seized by the folly or genius to make a movie about a human and a wild beast? Paging Ang Lee. In his Life of Pi which tonight opens the New York Film Festival in a thunderclap announcing the shock of the new the Taiwan-born American director piles visual miracle atop emotional epiphany. From its first image of a small bear hugging a tree as a hummingbird fluttering above it -- and seemingly flies through the movie house -- the movie declares its intention to astound the viewer with the hitherto untapped properties of 3-D. Pi builds on the innovations in stereoscopy triumphantly heralded by James Camerons Avatar and the advances in motion-capture technology evident in Rise of the Planet of the Apes to create a tactile spectacular world of wonder. Viewers see a flock of flying fish attack the boat or the tiger tangle with a vicious hyena and blink thinking this cant be happening; then they open their eyes in amazement to realize it is happening. (READ Corlisss review of Avatar) A techno-brat like Robert Zemeckis might have been attracted to this tale of the teenage Pi (Suraj Sharma) the only human survivor of a shipwreck that took the lives of his family stranded on an immense ocean in a confined space with a wild creature who could kill him with one swipe of a paw. Zemeckis has used motion-capture for childrens fables (The Polar Express) and Dark Age dramas (Beowulf) and in his last live-action film Cast Away put Tom Hanks through an ordeal of desert-island isolation. But Lee in a quieter way is just as headstrong a pioneer. To tell him that a film project is impossible is just a way of getting him interested in it. Having come to the University of Illinois for college and made his first films in New York City Lee plunged himself into another alien culture by directing Jane Austens comedy of brittle manners Sense and Sensibility. He reinvented the martial-arts epic with Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and earned an Oscar for his gay-cowboy romance Brokeback Mountain. (READ Richard Schickels review of Ang Lees Brokeback Mountain) Making a film about a teenager who is Noah Robinson Crusoe and Siegfried (without Roy) who encounters all manner of sea life plus an orangutan a hyena and about a million meerkats and whose mortal enemy and sole companion is an adult tiger had a uniquely high degree of difficulty. A decade ago a Life of Pi movie could not have been imagined let alone realized -- unless Lee had employed a severely sedated tiger or summoned an endless supply of lookalike actors to play Pi and replace the ones whom a more energetic beast would have clawed or devoured. Now thanks to advances in technique and a new generation of artist-tinkerers it can be done. Life of Pi from a script by David Magee isnt all storm-and-fang; it has recognizable Ang Lee elements. The tensions in a loving family familiar from Sense and Sensibility are reprised here in the relationship of young Pi (played at age 12 by Ayush Tandon) to his father (Adil Hussain) who owns a zoo in the Indian city of Pondicherry and mother (Indian indie icon Tabu). The prickly love stories at the heart of Lees The Ice Storm Brokeback Mountain and Lust Caution get a more tender tentative play in the friendship of young Pi and a girl (Shravanthi Sainath) he meets at a dance class. (READ Corlisss review of Ang Lees Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) When Pis father is obliged to sell the Pondicherry zoo he books his family and the animals on a Japanese cargo ship headed for Canada; the storm that sinks the ship kills his parents and disperses the creatures -- another amazing sequence -- launches Pi on cross-Pacific journey that lasts seven months. That trek has its analog in Lees own itinerary which has taken him from Taiwan to the U.S. to Britain and finally back to his homeland where he built a huge tank for the sea scenes. Pis quest which tests his spirit no less than his resolve will lead him through three religions and a climactic enlightenment -- all of which the adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) describes to the Canadian writer (Rafe Spall) who hears his story. Those present-day scenes are the movies only sign of clumsiness though Khan tells the tale with a poised poignance. To prepare for this daunting challenge -- a no-star production whose budget that according to Anne Thompson of Thompson on Hollywood ""far exceeded its planned 70 million cost"" -- Lee created a 70-minute ""pre-viz"" of the movies central section on the life raft (we cant wait to see it as an extra on the Life of Pi DVD) then led a team of digital sorcerers to bring the tiger to vivid life on the boat. When Sharma at todays New York Film Festival press conference was asked about spending months with a tiger replied ""It was pretty lonely on the boat. There was no tiger."" Yet the creature is as mean majestic and as palpable as the one painted by Henri Rousseau in Tiger in a Tropical Storm (Surprised) -- a title that applies equally here. (READ Corlisss review of Ang Lees Lust Caution) The difference is that in Life of Pi its the audience that is slack-jawed. On Lees Pacific the surface is a shimmering mirror; it reflects the sky so clearly that Pi seems to be both underwater and above the clouds. At times Lee follows the hallucinations of the malnourished boy -- as in an underwater montage where fish form a mosaic of his faraway girlfriends face. The cinematography of Claudio Miranda (The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) has the pellucid immediacy of a fever dream. Instead of the ecstatic soaring of the cross-species lovers in Avatar this dream or nightmare is taking place in the remotest part of what we call Earth. We see dire and divine events unfold through Pis troubled spirit and at times through the eye of the tiger. (READ How Rise of the Planet of the Apes revolutionized the action movie) To compare Life of Pi with Avatar is not to suggest that Lees movie will challenge the Cameron movie for all-time box office supremacy. But Pi is a giant leap forward outward and upward in expanding the resources of the evolving medium of movies. Magical realism was rarely so magical and never before so real.

A majestic whale breathtakingly leaps from a placid sea turning the waters treacherous. A crouching Bengal tiger stares piercingly into our eyes then lets loose a bloodcurdling roar.Virtually every scene in Lees mostly successful adaptation of Yann Martels 2001 award-winning best-selling novel -- about a 16-year-old boy nicknamed Pi adrift at sea for 227 days with a surly tiger -- is awe-inspiring and beautiful. But as lavish and startling as that imagery and those sensations are ""Pi"" has rocky moments too. One of its central narrative structures comes across as clumsy and artificial and the overall pace is languid even slow. But since this is this is a technical marvel of epic proportions those are minor misgivings. ""Pi"" might not be perfect but you have to see it to believe it. Its no surprise the visual banquet comes from the Oscar-winning Lee. The directors resume is rife with contemplative fare that he poetically and sensitively has brought to life -- from the colorful tapestry he embroidered in the sensual and tragic ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" to the stark repressed emotional and physical terrain his characters navigated in ""Brokeback Mountain.""Advertisement With ""Life of Pi"" Lee outdoes himself visually without a doubt setting a new standard for 3-D a technology Hollywood has mostly abused with crass recklessness. In ""Pi"" the special effects are seamlessly woven into Martels densely allegorical fabric a story wrangled on-screen by screenwriter David Magee (""Finding Neverland""). Lee has taken on material that -- much like David Mitchells ingenious and audacious ""Cloud Atlas"" -- had been considered unfilmable. Since the bulk of the story involves a teen and a tiger perilously stuck on a boat its a tough feat to pull off on film. To successfully transfer ""Pi"" to the big screen landmark state-of-the-art CGI effects were essential with 3-D as an added stimulant. Here the 3-D enhances rather than distracts. Thats exactly how 3-D should be used deployed not just because it looks cool.On face value the swirl of effects gussies up a relatively simple plot about the ordeal Piscine Molitor Patel (impressive newcomer Suraj Sharma) endures at sea with a tiger named Richard Parker. Pi -- as hes nicknamed -- is a curious and young religious explorer who becomes caught in the unenviable position in the Pacific when the ship hes traveling on with his parents is wrecked.We realize immediately that Pi survives his ordeal since an older version of himself (Bollywood star Irrfan Khan) provides narration. The older Pi is now living in Canada and as in the book he imparts his inspiring story to a writer (Rafe Spall) dealing with writers block. It is in these vital sequences between scribe and teller that ""Pi"" and Lee stumble.While this narrative conceit is integral to the theme of Martels work -- about how stories and faith can be life preservers we cling to in order to survive -- it comes across on-screen as stilted and stagey. The result is a more muted finale that doesnt have the powerful emotional punch it should.The rest of the film is more alive and elemental including in the way Lee colorfully illustrates Pis entrancing youthful days in Pondicherry India where his dad runs a zoo. Lee also creates a gripping shipwreck but the main attractions are those days and nights Pi spends with Richard Parker -- a remarkable creation.It is in those moments where Lee is completely in sync with the material. But youll have to see for yourself. And make sure thats not at home on DVD but seated in a theater wearing 3-D glasses with the willingness to surrender to Lees deliberately paced yet luminous and magical journey.You can contact Randy Myers at rmyersbayareanewsgroup.com and follow him at Twitter.com/soitsrandy and at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.RandyMyers.Life of Pi    1/2Rating PG (for emotional thematic contact throughout and some scary action sequences and peril)Cast Suraj Sherma Irrfan Khan Tabu Rafe Spall Gerard DepardieuDirector Ang LeeRunning time 2 hours 7 minutesYou can contact Randy Myers at rmyersbayareanewsgroup.com and follow him at Twitter.com/soitsrandy and at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.RandyMyers.Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

Where you identify that line in art and in yourself is likely to determine how well you tolerate this movie. As readers of the book already know ""Life of Pi"" can be described as a spiritual odyssey or a shaggy dog story (in which the dog is a tiger with a human name). Lee something of a stylistic chameleon whose previous work includes ""Brokeback Mountain"" ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""The Ice Storm"" cranks up the dial in both directions; this picture is part Bhagavad Gita and part Hallmark card from Deepak Chopra.Many viewers will be enthralled with the sheer gorgeous spectacle on display here and understandably so. Most early reviews have been glowing although nothing on Gods green earth glows with the radioactive fervor of this movie. ""Life of Pi"" is doubtless one of the biggest films of the last several years in terms of cost ambition and visual imagination and will obviously play a role in the years Oscar race. (Any year that encompasses both ""Life of Pi"" and ""Lincoln"" destroys the notion that all prestige Hollywood pictures present the same worldview or strike the same tone.) Personally though I wanted out of that damn lifeboat long before the tiger and his companion reached their final destination. I felt like Id been invited to a seven-course dinner and all seven turned out to be cake - and then the host insisted on delivering a lecture about how cake would bring me closer to God.There can be no question that ""Life of Pi"" is a spectacular visual experience clear winner of this years ""Avatar""-meets-""Hugo"" prize for pure wow factor. It features colors more dazzling than any found in nature and uses cutting-edge 3-D technology to help frame and tell the story not just as a staging ground for stunts. One gorgeous tableau follows another with Lee cinematographer Claudio Miranda and production designer David Gropman constantly upping the ante in search of revelatory phantasmagorical moments of pure cinema. Several gorgeous sequences that would have been all but impossible to stage until recently are piled on top of each other A howling storm at sea shot from an array of impossible angles; a breaching humpback whale encrusted with bioluminescent plankton; a sinister glowing island of meerkats who seem to have escaped from some nightmarish sequel to ""Horton Hears a Who.""Overall though I felt as if Lee and his collaborators were taking an unsustainable short cut to the land of maximum wonder. ""Life of Pi"" tries to get you to that state of quasi-orgasmic mind-blowing metaphysical whateverness found in the latter stages of Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" but by way of a charming somewhat insipid fairy tale rather than an ambiguous science-fiction masterpiece. In fairness the meaty middle of this movie when a teenage Indian boy named Pi Patel (first-time actor Suraj Sharma) finds himself orphaned and alone in the middle of the ocean with an outlandish menagerie of companions - an orangutan a zebra a hyena and Richard Parker the aforementioned 450-pound Bengal tiger - is a gripping and startling survival tale for all its fancy. Its all the fussy whimsical architecture around that central story that causes the problem. You Might Also Like Before we get to Pis life-or-death struggle to coexist with Richard Parker on that lifeboat we see him both as an adult and a child. The adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) living in Canada sometime in the future tells his story to a visiting American writer (Rafe Spall) promising that it will make him believe in God. (Did not have that effect on me.) And then we enter Pis implausibly idyllic childhood back in the Frenchified Indian city of Pondicherry where his father operates a zoo and the whole setting has a pronounced Eden-before-the-Fall feeling. (I dont suppose that either Martel or Lee is trying to render India in strictly realistic terms but Id love to know whether Indians find this Technicolor-storybook presentation of their country endearing or irritating.)Pi has named himself after the famous mathematical constant which is both a transcendent and an irrational number in preference to his birth name Piscine which is the French word for ""swimming pool."" Im damned if I know why any of that is important but its exactly the sort of detail whimsical and seemingly symbolic on which ""Life of Pi"" rests. (Screenwriter David Magee has truncated the story considerably while sticking pretty closely to Martels tone and the order of events.) Raised in a Hindu family thats not especially devout Pi also embraces Christianity and Islam declining to see any contradiction between these competing views of the divine. We are supposed to believe it seems that the combination of naivety and sophistication required to follow incompatible faiths will also allow him to survive alongside Richard Parker on the open ocean. Sharma a game and appealing physical performer is the only actor who leaves any impression largely because the dazzling effects and the 3-D camerawork are the stars of the show. The rowboat and the water in ""Life of Pi"" are real - much of this film was shot in a gigantic Taiwanese water tank often used for aquatic photography - but Richard Parker the tiger Pis principal antagonist and best friend is mostly a digital creation. That sums things up at least for me. Its tempting to compare ""Life of Pi"" to ""Cloud Atlas"" if only because both are big expensive effects-driven movies with spiritual pretensions and metaphorical layers of meaning. But I dont think theyre similar at all in the end. ""Cloud Atlas"" is a flawed messy passionate film about people as they hopelessly try to ask and answer the biggest questions. ""Life of Pi"" is a cleaner prettier sweeter and altogether more likable film about a tiger who isnt there. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

It takes place largely on a lifeboat adrift in the South Pacific that carries radically mismatched buddies a skinny 16-year-old Indian vegetarian with the odd name Pi (Suraj Sharma) and a man-eating Bengal tiger with the even odder name Richard Parker. The lifeboat isnt entirely lifelike mind you. The waters aquamarine is more like ultra-ultramarine the sea a mirror in which clouds above seem to mingle with sharks dorados luminous jellyfish even whales below. Later on an island thats mysteriously alive the orange of the tiger burns especially bright in the chlorophyll-green forest of the ebony-black night. Life of Pi looks neither natural nor egregiously fake but vivid as if a knob had been turned way up on the color of each objects spirit and the real world into a sort of pantheistic storybook. And thats exactly the right look for what it is a tale told by the older Pi (Irrfan Khan) to a writer (Rafe Spall) who has sought him out after hearing that Pi had a story to make him believe in God. Im not sure how I felt about God at the end of Life of Pi but I fervently believed in the magic of movies. Some of that magic comes from the 3-D which Lee shows off in the first seconds of the credit sequence. In an Indian zoo owned by Pis parents the camera lingers on paintings of animals on walls that bear a striking resemblance to cave paintingsand then look out the animals 3-D counterparts are suddenly comin at ya. Those cave painters would freak out. But theres also something old-fashioned about Lees frames. He holds the shots for a long time longer than any major American studio head would let him if not for that marvelously immersive technology. Armed with 3-D Lee can slow the storytelling down without worrying about modern audiences getting antsy. And he has Mychael Dannas score one of Dannas East-West hybrids (Persian flutes and gamelan weaving in and out of Romantic orchestrations) providing a sense of flux when the images are static. That lifeboat goes nowhere fast. Pis god (God gods) is (are) also in flux Hes a polymath a Hindu who thanks Lord Vishnu for introducing him to Christ while rolling out his prayer mat to honor Allah. This kid subscribes to everythingand this in the face of his fathers blunt reliance on reason and insistence that creatures like the tiger (which gazes into Pis eyes and sees only lunch) have no souls. Pis own faith in the Higher Power(s) gets the test of his or anyones life when the ship bound for North America bearing his family and their animals (theyre emigrating) goes down along with most of the living things onboard. The audience meanwhile witnesses the uplifting arrival of the god of cinema. In one fluid motion a zebra (it must be CGI but who can tell?) leaps crazily into the lifeboat and lands with a terrible backbreaking thud. Theres an orangutan grieving for a lost child and hiding under a tarpaulin is the pieces real villain a madly carnivorous hyena. Richard Parker swims aboard and carnage ensuesthough far less explicit than the corresponding passages of Yann Martels novel. Left alone with each other and their dwindling supplies of food Pi and Parker achieve a tense detente though let it be said that Lee like Martel goes all out to avoid even a whiff of family-friendly anthropomorphosizing. Despite that name Richard Parker remains an animal in circumstances known to turn the most civilized human into a beast. Dread forestalls dearness. Life of Pi evokes Melvilles mordant answer to the Transcendentalists in Moby-Dick You might sit astride a mast and feel a oneness with nature but fall into the sea and youll be quickly digested. Even those clunky interludes with the grown-up Pi and the interviewer (poor Spall with so little to play) end up paying off. The movie has a sting in its tail that puts what youve seen in a startlingly harsh context. It turns out Lee has more affinity for Pi the yarn-spinner than for any of his other heroes. His movies (Lust Caution; Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon; Hulk; Brokeback Mountain; Taking Woodstock) center on emotions that cant be suppressed and finally burst forthbut the meticulousness of his framing and color-coordination (or that mythical cowboy iconography in Brokeback Mountain) make his work seem one step removed as if in a terrarium. In Life of Pi he finally has a story in which that very distance is the source of the emotion. Pi has designed his own terrarium to keep from staring directly into the abyss. Its not denial. Its faith in something else the transformative power of storytelling. The film is transcendent. Life of Pi Directed by Ang Lee. Twentieth Century Fox. PG. E-mail filmcriticnewyorkmag.com.

""Who trusted God was love indeed/And love Creations final law/Tho Nature red in tooth and claw/With ravine shriekd against his creed"" - Alfred Lord Tennyson. ""Im on a Boat"" - Foursquare. Talk about high expectations. ""This story will make you believe in God"" narrator Irrfan Khan promises listener Rafe Spall. The former a relaxed middle-aged man with sadness in his eyes making some lunch in his nondescript Canadian home. The latter a blocked novelist following a tip on a tale too good not to write about (and perhaps too good to be true.) We open in Pondicherry a former French section of India and its colors and architecture burst off the screen. Director Ang Lee uses every corner of the frame to create an outstanding tapestry of images quickly assuaging any fears that the use of 3-D is an exhibitors cash grab. (Most will agree this is the best use of stereo since Martin Scorseses ""Hugo"" or perhaps ever.) Our young hero is named Piscine Patel named for a particularly gorgeous French swimming pool but after schoolyard torments he changes his name to Pi. He ceremonial self-appellation math jokes included is one of a number of marvelous joyous sequences in the emotionally resonant first act. The Patel family owns a zoo and this closeness to animals is a part of Pis upbringing. Pondicherry is a diverse neighborhood so hes exposed not only to his inherited Hinduism but Catholicism and Islam as well. He is a boy that is receptive to the notion of God but cannot choose which faith to go with. He therefore takes aspects of them all to the mild consternation of his secular humanist father. Pis childhood faith-shopping is quite beautiful and respectful and something quite under-discussed in cinema. Some may question what this lengthy prologue has to do with the bulk of the film but tonally it is key to setting the course of the story. The Patel familys finances force them to pull up stakes and sail for Canada taking their zoo animals with them. Pi a teenager now and a little bit defiant allows his sense of invincibility to take him out to the ships deck during a major storm. Turns out this works in his favor as he is one of the few creatures to survive. He finds himself on a lifeboat with an injured zebra an orangutan a rat an angry hyena and the gorgeous and regal Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The tigers name is explained in the story but it is actually a reference to well known victims/survivors of shipwrecks. Eventually it is just the two of them in the boat well the three of them if you count God and you should as ""Life of Pi"" is one of the more vehemently pro-faith films youll see that doesnt star Kirk Cameron. The God of ""Life of Pi"" is tough to pin down. One image of Pi in silhouette against the magic hour sky as he shouts ""No"" to the fighting beasts is a postcard from Deist thought. There are no loaves but man are there multiplying (and flying) fishes. But the bulk of the picture studies the Hindu belief of animals having souls. The way Lee photographs Richard Parkers deep penetrating eyes leaves little doubt but theres enough fight in the film and its portrayal of animal instinct and indifference to let the opposing view make its case. Pi and Richard Parker have the standard survivalist struggles variants of those you can find in everything from ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" to Peter Weirs ""The Way Back."" The spin here is Lees visual exuberance and alacrity. Unlike ""127 Hours"" there are few cutaways into Pis mind making Lees achievement perhaps even more extraordinary. There isnt a dull moment in the film and there are about 300 worthy of a ""wow."" Unfortunately much of the dialogue (both spoken or narrated) is a tad too earnest for my taste. When moments of levity do come they are as welcome as a pail of rainwater at sea. ""Life of Pi"" is also one of those movies that has to end by telling you what a great movie you saw. This device works in say Milos Formans ""Amadeus"" because yes that is indeed a thick juicy story with outrageous characters and fascinating reversals. ""Life of Pi"" is a gorgeously filmed fictional tone poem about a guy and a tiger on a boat thinking about God. Not quite the same. Though I consider myself a secular humanist I dont begrudge or shun artists of faith who put their devotion into their work. Ill cite Denys Arcands ""Jesus of Montreal"" and Xavier Beauvois ""Of Gods of Men"" as two films I adore and those are just the ones in French. ""Life of Pi"" however doesnt quite reach a sublime level. At the third act twist where things become a bit fantastic it comes apart and then ultimately whimpers off like a drenched cat. The flat ending is quite a letdown especially in comparison to just how much the rest of the film resonates. If you come to ""Life of Pi"" looking for answers I think you will be very disappointed. (Or if you do find answers you are a very easy mark.) As filmmaking however it is a knockout and there are moments one in particular only a jerk would spoil that should be included in every ""iconic images in cinema"" moments for the rest of time. In short get on the boat and drift a while.

A literal crouching tiger is merely one of many visual wonders in Ang Lees ""Life of Pi"" a gently transporting work of all-ages entertainment that melds a harrowing high-seas adventure with a dreamy meditation on the very nature of storytelling. Summoning the most advanced digital-filmmaking technology to deliver the most old-fashioned kind of audience satisfaction this exquisitely beautiful adaptation of Yann Martels castaway saga has a sui generis quality thats never less than beguiling even if its fable-like construction and impeccable artistry come up a bit short in terms of truly gripping elemental drama. Following its opening-night world premiere at the New York Film Festival the Nov. 21-slated Fox release should find itself in exceedingly friendly B.O. waters at home and abroad. That the film was lensed in 3D should further boost its prospects and discerning viewers will be pleased to note that the format has been used here to artistically as well as commercially productive ends. Published in 2001 Martels Booker Prize-winning bestseller was widely deemed unfilmable due to its allegorical thrust and more crucially its prolonged focus on a teenage boy and a tiger spending 227 days adrift in the Pacific. Fortunately Lee and scribe David Magee (""Finding Neverland"") have extracted the books inherently cinematic qualities turning Martels vivid wildlife descriptions into a feast for the eyes; the films sheer beauty is so overwhelming so vibrant in its use of color as to become almost cloying at times. The visual lushness is apparent from the opening shots of Pondicherry India a former French colony where Santosh Patel (Adil Hussain) and his wife (Tabu) operate a zoo. The younger of their two sons is Piscine (played by Gautam Belur and Ayush Tandon at ages 5 and 11 respectively) a bright curious child whose sense of mischief is tempered by his unusual reverence for God. The humorous highlights of the boys upbringing -- how he wisely shortens his name to Pi and becomes a devout Hindu Christian and Muslim -- are recounted by his middle-aged modern-day counterpart (Irrfan Khan). Dreamlike dissolves help ease the scripts shifts between past and present which feel clunky and prosaic even as they lay the groundwork for the slippery metaphysical questions that will arise later. Fortunately the framing device disappears almost entirely at the 40-minute mark as the story proper starts and the picture truly begins to cast a spell. Having decided to sell the zoo and move to Canada the Patels find themselves along with a few remaining animals aboard a Japanese freighter that swiftly capsizes in a thunderstorm leaving 17-year-old Pi (Suraj Sharma) the sole human survivor as he manages to climb into a lifeboat. Its an astonishing sequence rendered all the more so by the lucidity of the direction; rather than resorting to herky-jerky lensing and editing Lee uses relatively long takes smooth cuts and seamlessly integrated f/x to navigate the viewer through the action. Even as the waves heave and roll (to especially fearsome effect in 3D) the film finds room for isolated moments of haunting poetry such as the sight of the ships ghostly white lights descending into the abyss. Once the storm retreats Pi realizes a few zoo denizens have made it onto the lifeboat although the food chain soon dictates that the only remaining animal onboard is a ferocious 450-pound Bengal tiger incongruously named Richard Parker. Pi realizes hes going to have to tame the tiger a thinly veiled metaphor for his own inner beast and as the days stretch into weeks and months the relationship between these two unlikely companions shifts movingly and almost imperceptibly from mutual wariness into something as close to love as the laws of interspecies friendship can allow. Despite such severe dramatic limitations theres no shortage of incident and surprise even when Lee isnt rattling the audience with shots of the tiger lunging at the camera. The films engrossing often amusing midsection amounts to a practical illustration of survival-at-sea strategies as Pi constructs a raft that provides some physical distance and protection from Richard Parker and finds ways to supplement his dwindling store of water and rations. Sharma a non-pro making a terrifically engaging screen debut underwent considerable weight fluctuations for the role and he compellingly manifests Pis physical sufferings while maintaining a persuasive rapport with his four-legged co-star (achieved almost entirely through CGI and modeled after four actual Bengal tigers). Lee and d.p. Claudio Miranda approach the technical challenges with similarly intense commitment. Shooting in the worlds largest self-generating wave tank (with a capacity of 1.7 million gallons) they turn their visual restrictions into virtues. The nimbly circling camera is forever finding compelling angles on the action sometimes bobbing gently above and below the waters surface conveying a sense of perpetual motion that might test some of the more sensitive stomachs in the audience. Yet the images just as often have a classical stillness and grandeur as in a scene of bioluminescent fish illuminating the water at night or an otherworldly shot of the boat gliding atop the oceans smooth glassy surface. In these moments ""Life of Pi"" embodies its protagonists spiritual devotion infusing a tale of peril isolation and loss with a genuine sense of grace and awe at the majesty of creation. The overall effect of such exalted yet artificially achieved visuals is to loose the boundaries of conventional realism and steer the picture into a magically heightened realm immersing the viewer in the story without losing sight of the fact that a story in fact is all it is. For all the splendor of the craftsmanship on display from David Gropmans eye-popping production design to Mychael Dannas Indian-inflected score whats missing is a certain in-the-moment urgency. Compressing nearly eight months into roughly 75 minutes of screentime is a tricky task and one never gets a sense of the agonizing duration of Pis experience especially since the film tastefully sidesteps most of the raw physically extreme details that made the novel so visceral. As much as it teems with color and creativity ""Life of Pi"" could have used a bit more grit substance and a touch of the grotesque. Even its warm-hearted plea for religious faith feels in the end like so much pantheistic fairy dust. The film was reviewed from an unfinished print (identical to the version that will play NYFF) with complete end credits and excellent sound and picture quality apart from some infrequent aspect-ratio disparities that will likely be finessed before release.

TWITTER Ang Lee achieves an admirable sense of wonder in this tall tale about a shipwrecked teenager stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger. Technology employed by sensitive hands brings to vivid life a work that would have been inconceivable onscreen until very recently in Life of Pi. Ang Lee that great chameleon among contemporary directors achieves an admirable sense of wonder in this tall tale about a shipwrecked teenager stranded on a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger a yarn that has been adapted from the compellingly peculiar best-seller with its beguiling preposterousness intact. Like the venerable all-purpose entertainments of Hollywoods classical era this exceptionally beautiful 3D production should prove accessible to and embraceable by all manner of audiences signaling substantial commercial possibilities domestically and probably even more so internationally. The Fox release is having its world premiere as the opening-night attraction at the 50th New York Film Festival with general release set for Nov. 21. PHOTOS Fall Movie Preview 2012 Major New Releases From Spielberg Jackson Tarantino the Wachowskis Burton and More Yann Martels 2001 novel was one of those out-of-the-blue one-shots a book with a madly fanciful premise so deftly handled that it won the Man Booker Prize and sold 7 million copies. Part survival story part youthful fable part grade-school spiritual rumination and assessment of humanitys place in the animal kingdom its man versus nature with a quizzically philosophical spin thats easy to digest even for kids. Its not surprising that it took producer Gil Netter a decade to get the film made as technology would not have permitted it to be realized at least in anything close to its current form until the past few years. Shot on location in India as well as in a giant tank in Taiwan where the open-water effects scenes were made Life of Pi is an unusual example of anything-is-possible technology put at the service of a humanistic and intimate story rather than something that smacks of a manufactured product. VIDEO New Life of Pi Trailer Features Irrfan Khan and Rafe Spall The first enchantment is the town of Pondicherry a former French colony in southern India that looks like paradise on Earth nowhere more so than at the zoo run by the father of young Pi. The nimble and faithful script by David Magee (Finding Neverland) packs a good deal of character and cultural background into the first half-hour humorously sketching the odd watery and mathematical implications of the protagonists name; neatly relating his unconflicted adoption of Hinduism Christianity and Islam at age 12; portraying the warm family life he enjoys with his parents and older brother; and topped off with a taste of budding first love. But hard times prompt his father to announce a move to Canada where he will sell all the animals. A full hour is set at sea beginning with a nocturnal storm and horrible shipwreck. When the air clears the only survivors sharing space on a 27-foot lifeboat are Pi an injured zebra a maniacal hyena a dour orangutan a rat and -- hidden from sight for a spell under a tarp -- a large tiger. Hunger and the law of the jungle assure that the population onboard is shortly reduced to two. To nonreaders of the novel incredulity over Pis ability to co-exist with the tiger -- which goes by the name of Richard Parker -- is carefully addressed and its essential that Pi proves adept at fashioning a makeshift raft that connects to the tigers lair by a rope. Still 227 days is a very long time to keep fed and maintain your wits on the open sea for both man and beast and this floating journey is marked by ordeal (this must be the first film to present the spectacle of a seasick tiger) and such startling sights as a sudden flurry of flying fish luminous jellyfish setting the nighttime sea aglow a breaching whale and another enormous storm that looks to spell the end for Pi and Richard Parker. But the final half-hour offers an other-worldly pit stop before coming to roost in a framing story in which the adult Pi tells his tall tale to a wide-eyed writer in a literary conceit that at the very end spells things out rather too explicitly. VIDEO Life of Pi Trailer Wows With a Mighty Storm and 3D Adventure Meticulous care is evident in every aspect of the film. All three actors playing Pi are outstanding. The lions (or tigers) share of the burden falls on 17-year-old Suraj Sharma the only human on view for half the time obliged to act in a vacuum and convincingly represent all the physical demands. Lee looked at 3000 candidates for the role (deliberately avoiding Bollywood talent) and found an unknown whose emotional facility is quite impressive. Ayush Tandon is captivating as the sponge that is young Pi but absolutely imperative to the films success are the heart lucidity and gravity Irrfan Khan provides as the grown-up Pi looking back at his experience. Gerard Depardieu is in briefly to embody hulking menace as a nasty French cook aboard the ill-fated cargo ship. STORY Tobey Maguire Cut From Oscar Contender Life of Pi Creating a plausible ever-changing physical world was the first and overarching technical challenge met by the effects team. The extra step here was rendering a tiger that would be believable in every way from its violent movements and threatening stares to its desperate moments when soaked through and starving it attempts to claw its way back onboard the small boat. With one passing exception -- a long shot of the tiger making its way through a sea of meerkats thats a bit off -- the representation of Richard Parker is extraordinarily lifelike. The leap of faith required for Lee to believe this could be put up onscreen in a credible way was necessarily considerable. His fingerprints are at once invisible and yet all over the film in the tact intelligence curiosity and confidence that characterizes the undertaking. At all times the film shot by Claudio Miranda and with production design by David Gropman is ravishing to look at and the 3D work is discreetly powerful. Mychael Danna composed the emotionally fluent score. Venue New York Film Festival (opening night) Opens Wednesday Nov. 21 (Fox) Production Fox 2000 Haishang Films Gil Netter Prod.

Much of the story narrated by its spiritually minded protagonist contains prolonged philosophical discussions and remains tethered to an extremely minimalist setting. That Ang Lee has managed to turn the limitations of his source material into his adaptations greatest strength makes ""Life of Pi"" a significant achievement for the filmmaker in spite of blatant problems with structure dialogue and other surface issues. ""Life of Pi"" succeeds in its most audacious moments and struggles whenever it returns to familiar ground. David Magees generally faithful screenplay deepens the sensationalistic imagery of the novels opening setting with enjoyably ostentatious 3D that instantly leaves an impression. The title sequence is set in the lavish Indian zoo where the inquisitive Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) is raised by his secular father. From the first 30 seconds of the film when a hummingbird hovers before our eyes and a sloth seemingly dangles off the screen ""Life of Pi"" announces Lees intention to craft astonishing visions. READ MORE New York Film Festival Highlights From The Press Conference For Instant Oscar Frontrunner Life of Pi But when the movie flashes forward a number of years to find an adult Pi (Irrfan Khan) living comfortably in Canada and recounting his incredible experience to a wide-eyed journalist Rafe Spall) ""Life of Pi"" introduces a sloppy framing device that instantly drags the exposition into problematic territory. Notwithstanding Pis constant voiceover Lees insistence on returning to Pis austere living room throughout his tale constantly interrupts the allure of a significantly engaging parable. Whenever Lee abandons the contemporary setting the movie successfully funnels its thematic conceits into an involving high seas epic. At its core ""Life of Pi"" revolves around one mans ongoing attempt to reconcile his spiritual tendencies with an awareness of natures inherently chaotic state (in the book the character double-majored in zoology and religious studies). The early scenes that establish the adolescent Pis burgeoning interest in world religions despite his strict fathers disdain move swiftly along aided by the exotic backdrop the zoo provides. Once the family decides to leave the zoo and set sail for Canada with their menagerie in tow ""Life of Pi"" enters into a fantasy realm enhanced by the surrounding waves which eventually subsume the weak ship. With phenomenal underwater footage that realizes the pandemonium of wild animals run loose on a slippery vessel the intense and supremely well-crafted scene of the ships demise is perhaps the best of its kind since ""Titanic."" Its the first of several disorienting moments of lyrical beautiful to transcend the clumsy screenplay. Once aboard his lifeboat with a handful of animals including the fierce tiger curiously named Richard Parker Pi struggles to survive the restless sea while forming an odd symbiotic relationship with the starving beast. From this point forward the main scenario forms Lees most spectacular achievement since ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" -- ironically enough theres more tiger in this movie than that one and hes a magnificently realized screen presence -- and the movie certainly represents Lees grandest directorial achievement since ""Brokeback Mountain."" With Pi and the tiger trapped on their tiny craft ""Life of Pi"" settles into a contained drama thats enlivened with storybook imagery. Heavily reliant on CGI from the team behind ""Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" Pis saga includes more than just a daunting tiger. The grandiose critters he encounters at sea include massive schools of fish colossal whales and jellyfish that light up the ocean in the dark of night. For reasons only revealed later on ""Life of Pi"" contains a tremendously involving degree of magical realism that enhances the harsh fairy tale quality of the adventure. The movies visuals frequently transcend the plot. In one instance Pis cosmic hallucination of land and sea creatures morphing together against a starry backdrop easily outdoes all the soul-searching dialogue (""God I am your vessel"" Pi shouts to the heavens in one of several cases where the script overstates his crisis of faith). Anchored by newcomer Sharma in the lead role ""Life of Pi"" is better at conveying the young mans mounting despair than his lingering optimism. With ongoing reminders that his plight represents something beyond its superficial definition Lees film constantly undoes its own spell particularly in the painfully obvious closing act. But its still a wild ride to get there. Considering its flaws the number of elements that do connect not only stand out but actively sustain the movies appeal. Unlike ""Castaway"" or other tales of marooned victims struggling against natures indifference ""Life of Pi"" manages to inspire the same kind of awe that at other times it overstates to cheesy effect. In its finer moments however Lee translates the books prose into grand visual conceits meant for the big screen. Posited as a story that ""will make you believe in god"" instead it has the power to confirm ones faith in the cinematic experience. Criticwire grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? An appropriate choice to open the 50th edition of the New York Film Festival ""Life of Pi"" is being released nationwide tomorrow by 20th Century Fox. It seems destined to fill the ""Hugo"" slot during this years awards season for its status as a heavily effects-driven and sentimentally involving epic and an even greater shot at awards acclaim due to the popularity of the book. Conversely the awards season is already very crowded and the film may have a hard time maintaining its long-term box office viability with the flood of contenders filling theaters next month.
