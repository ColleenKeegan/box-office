In 2004 Bnei Sakhnin a poorly funded northern Israel soccer club made up of Arabs Jews and foreigners won the prestigious State Cup and vaulted into the esteemed Premiere League along the way becoming a symbol of Middle East coexistence. Director Browne (A League of Ordinary Gentlemen) opens with this euphoric victory but truly trains his gaze on the subsequent year when elevated expectations internal bickering and mounting losses threatened to sabotage the squads potential for fostering harmony in the hostile region. Throughout the teams struggles on the pitch generate tension but the films most potent conflicts are off the field whether it be captain Abbas Suans attempts to live up to his nation-healing responsibility or the way in which Arab and Jewish fans are drawn to root for their own. The resulting portrait is a cautionary rejoinder to typical sports-movie uplift elucidating how athletics remain a dangerously precarious foundation upon which to construct lasting peace. (Nick Schager) (Music Hall) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - KITES Indian-made and trilingual in Hindi Spanish and English Kites is set and was mostly shot in the American Southwest -- although in its backlit visual overkill complete with neon reflected in rain-drenched streets it more closely resembles some of the most overwrought Hong Kong gangster romances of the late 1980s. Jay (Hrithik Roshan one of Hindi cinemas most engaging leading men) rolls off a freight train with a gaping bullet wound and a lot of backstory to unload. A con artist not as amoral as he thinks he is Jay makes the mistake of falling hard for Natasha (Barbara Mori) the fiancee of a spoiled young Sin City prince of crime setting up an impossibly beautiful lovers-on-the-run scenario that director Anurag Basu shoots like a series of windswept fashion videos. Even with the lights of the Vegas Strip forming a gauzy halo behind his tousled head Roshan is a master at low-keying his enormous charm and shrugging off his blinding handsomeness. Mori a Mexican telenovela star is almost a match for him Shes a dead ringer for Megan Fox but warmer less calculating in her sexiness. Not even the incoherent mishmash of plot (mostly faux Leone by way of Tarantino and Rodriguez with periodic car-flipping chase sequences) can entirely dim the appeal of this match-up between a blue-eyed Punjabi and a blue-eyed Mexican of almost equal comeliness. Kites will be released Stateside both in this original 130-minute subtitled version and in a shorter dubbed ""remix"" prepared by noted Bollywood aficionado Brett Ratner. You have been warned. (David Chute) (Beverly Center Culver Plaza Fallbrook)PRINCE OF PERSIA THE SANDS OF TIME Prince of Persia The Sands of Times story hinges on a dagger that can rewind time a narrative conceit that doubles as a taunt to those who endure this cacophonous frivolous adaptation of Ubisofts Arabian Nights-themed video-game series. Bruckheimered to the hilt with the same rollicking period-piece cheesiness that typified the producers (and studio Disneys) Pirates of the Caribbean franchise this Aladdin-indebted summer spectacle charts the efforts of noble prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) to clear his name after hes fingered for his fathers assassination a mission aided by a feisty princess (Clash of the Titans beauty Gemma Arterton) and a magic blade that fueled by divine sand gives those who wield it the ability to travel one minute back in time. Though too sweet and amicable a presence to radiate genuine ass-kicking machismo Gyllenhaal carries out his heros parkour derring-do with proficiency but director Mike Newell is ill-suited to steward such sword-and-sandals adventure. Bogged down by more leaden ripped-from-the-headlines allusions than this flippant fable can withstand most courtesy of a hammy Alfred Molina its merely a cash-my-paycheck-dammit film embodied by a disinterested Sir Ben Kingsley whose bald head and jet-black goatee position his stodgy scoundrel as a mini-me Ming the Merciless. (Nick Schager) (Citywide)SEX AND THE CITY 2 Sarah Jessica Parker is now 45 years old and frankly I cannot stomach another moment of the simpering mincing hair-tossing eyelash-batting little-girl shtick shes been pulling ever since L.A. Story. While her BFFs struggle on with work-life challenges (Miranda) child-care dilemmas (Charlotte) and cougar body maintenance (Samantha) Carrie Bradshaw carries the movies big-ticket question How do you hang on to your marital bling once the newlywed bliss is over especially if you dont want children and your husband has turned into a homebody? Why talk it to death in ever-decreasing circles of inconsequential angst then head for Abu Dhabi. There await the four Fs -- fashion food furnishings and fornication -- plus scads of cringe-making Middle Eastern stereotypes wrapped in a nominal shout-out to oppressed Arab women who guess what like Versace and suffer from hot flashes just like us. Having raked in 400 million for the first SATC Michael Patrick King can write his own ticket which may explain why SATC2 runs a crushing 146 minutes of not very funny gag lines wrapped in episodic miniscenes that generate more embarrassment than sympathy. I get that ""dignity be damned"" is some kind of feminist mantra for King. But its one thing to create pop icons as beloved as Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern were in the late 1970s. Its quite another to drag them well into middle age dress them like mutton passing as lamb and lumber them with female troubles culled straight from the mommy and single-lady blogs.

Sep. 13 600pm SHREK FOREVER AFTER In this fourth and final installation in the Shrek franchise our green hero feels emasculated by the grind of domesticity (marriage fatherhood) and worn down by the demands of celebrity. His failure to realize that his is indeed a wonderful life leads him to utter a wish for just one day to cavort in his old life of swampy bachelorhood. The wish is granted by the conniving Rumpelstiltskin whose enforcement of contractual fine-print lands Shrek in a brutal parallel universe in which Rumpelstiltskin rules the kingdom of Far Far Away with an army of witches as his muscle. There Fiona (in Xena mode) leads an underground resistance movement Donkey has no memory of Shrek but still steals almost every scene hes in and an obese Puss walks away with whatever scenes Donkey doesnt. It takes the film a deadly long time to kick in and when it does it largely retreads formula ironic use of pop standards musical numbers with contemporary choreography played for maximum laughs risque one-liners. By the middle of the second act Forever After finally finds its groove becoming mildly amusing (the actors -- Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz Antonio Banderas -- are in fine form) but never rising to the inspired heights of the original. And the 3-D effects are so weak as to bring nothing to the table. (Ernest Hardy) (Citywide)SURVIVAL OF THE DEAD The sixth installment in George A. Romeros long-running horror serial (est. 1967) follows Sarge Crockett (Alan Van Sprang) as he leads his gone-rogue unit of National Guardsmen from the zombie-pestilent mainland to ""Plum Island Delaware."" There the returned departed are feuded over by two family-armies led by Irish patriarchs. Once ashore the island seemingly preserved in the 1880s Romero piles on plotlines and Western tropes six-shooters an Anthony Mann Oedipal ranch hand a bona fide scalping and a homo-flirty mentor-student rapport between Van Sprang and Devon Bostick an orphaned teen he picked up. Bosticks character allows 70-year-old Romero to continue his uncomprehending fascination with gadget-addicted Millennials talking about things ""on the Net"" which made Diary of the Dead excruciating assurance that Survival could only possibly be the second-worst Dead movie. Romeros own embrace of new technology includes silly CGI violence like a noggin blown clean away leaving the scalp to plop on the neck stump or zombie eyeballs sproinging out of sockets like novelty glasses. The script reunites the writer-directors familiar preoccupations with the family-as-hell creeping Catholicism and stock rednecks. The inevitable all-you-can-eat orgy of zombies pulling stringy mouthfuls away from red wet rib cages may satisfy gorehounds but big set pieces showing how atrophied Romeros cutting and tactical framing have become is depressing to anyone who has valued his films for more than just splatter.

Craig Blankenhorn/Warner Bros/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of A sequel to ""Sex and the City""? I dont mean to offend all you ""SATC"" fanatics but do we really need to prolong the agony? Its not that Im against chick flicks. I actually rather like them especially when as in the case of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" the chicks are expert performers and not simply standing around quipping campily and modeling for the boudoir. Chick flicks are often more fascinating than guy films at least to this guy because they offer a window into a world that is usually kept out of the movies.But there are windows and then there are windows. The turquoise-tinted one in ""SATC2"" could use a deep scrub. I realize that gaudy fantasy is essential to this franchise but why does the fantasy have to be so stunted? Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Things begin semipromisingly as the ladies - bestselling author Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) mother-of-two Charlotte (Kristin Davis) workaholic lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and man-eater Samantha (Kim Cattrall) - attend a gay wedding featuring Liza Minnelli as headliner. This sequence is so purposefully over the top in displaying its camp credentials that it functions as a winking piece of self-satire. Nothing that follows has the same loony spritz. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Sex and the City 2 movie review Writer-director Michael Patrick King probably doesnt need to worry though since no doubt his audience will contentedly experience ""SATC2"" as a reunion with old friends - as opposed to you know a good movie. But just in case King has provided a story line that has the women traipsing about Abu Dhabi (actually Morocco) courtesy of a smitten sheikh. The palatial resplendence of their 20000 per night hotel with its endless pastel corridors and aquamarine pools resembles a Harlequin Romance fever dream. But have no fear Even in these climes the women cant hack happiness.Carrie for example had been having marital issues back in New York with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) and wouldnt you know it runs into an old boyfriend (John Corbett) in a shopping bazaar in Abu Dhabi. (When she expresses astonishment I expected him to answer ""Havent you read the script?"") Charlotte is worried her husband (Evan Handler) is dallying with their hot new nanny. (Chick flick rule No. 1 Do not hire hot nannies.) Miranda is acting as the groups game warden. Samantha meanwhile is having difficulty managing her rabid concupiscence in a Muslim country where kissing in public is apparently punishable by law.If King had any wit he would have included a scene where a burka-clad Samantha performs the dance of the seven veils for one of her many smitten studs. Instead he gives us a nutty-dumb sequence where the cocktail-infused quartet belt out ""I Am Woman"" in a karaoke bar.Near the end before the ladies beat a hasty retreat from Abu Dhabi they enjoy a clandestine sisterhood confab with some giggly Muslim women. Were meant to recognize that femaleness is the great leveler but really if you bother to take this scene seriously its patronizing. Just because well-to-do Muslim women wear Prada under all that anonymous outerwear doesnt mean theyre stark raving feminists. The Muslim women in ""SATC2"" are props in the froth.Come to think of it so are Carrie Charlotte Samantha and Miranda.

Now ""Sex and the City 2"" reveals what Islamic women want. Call this sequel callow garish ghastly grisly or grotesque--and it is all of those things plus borderline-interminable at 146 minutes. During a visit to Abu Dhabi though Carrie Samantha Miranda and Charlotte discover that the chadors worn by their Muslim sisters conceal--you guessed it--the glories of this years fashion collection. So much for a clash of civilizations. In this sequel to ""Sex and the City"" Carrie Bradshaw and the gang travel to Abu Dhabi. This dismal comedy provokes a crash of expectations however modest they may have been after the first theatrical version of the HBO series. Its a silly symphony of big anxious smiles and big nervous laughs. (In a film for the cognitively challenged everything but the tacky wardrobe is several sizes too big.) Its a cinematic dairy farm milking every close-up and every gag whether about menopause (the four friends are forever young only in reruns) or about a glamorous Irish nannys bouncy breasts. Its an almost avant-garde adventure in aimlessness. Apart from an elaborately cloying gay wedding nothing happens until somewhere near the half-hour mark when Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her beloved Mr. Big (Chris Noth) come up against a certifiable conflict--he wants to stay home and she doesnt. Thats when ""Sex and the City 2"" also becomes a triumph of product placement the product being Abu Dhabi (though what we see is actually Morocco). ""Dubai is over"" a dubious sheik declares. ""Abu Dhabi is the future."" ENLARGE From left Cynthia Nixon Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis in Sex and the City 2. New Line Productions Maybe so but it looks like the past--specifically a Bob Hope and Bing Crosby road movie with Kim Cattralls Samantha as a nymphomaniacal (and she never lets us forget menopausal) stand-in for Dorothy Lamour. Samantha manages to scandalize her Muslim hosts with carnality in public places while Carrie has a flirtation with having a flirtation after an encounter with an old flame that plays--and looks--like a potboiler produced by Ross Hunter. The production as a whole which was perpetrated as before by Michael Patrick King turns on a strategy of avoidance. Real feelings lurk just below the surface--Samanthas terror of growing old Carries fear of eventual tedium in a childless marriage. Yet the surface is where the movie stays like an old submarine with dead batteries. Father of My Children Im reluctant to tell you too much about ""Father of My Children."" Surprises abound and one of the events in its narrative flow left me so stunned that I wished the flow would stop until I could pull myself together. It isnt saying too much though to call Mia Hansen-Loves French-language drama beautiful profound and given the gathering tensions of its story phenomenally full of life. The father of the title Gregoire Canvel is an idealistic movie producer under siege. (Let me stop my own account long enough to note that this is more than a movie about making movies even though the details of Gregoires working life are rendered with precision and delightful verve.) One of his self-styled auteurs is out of control along with the movies budget and someone on the set has recently committed suicide. Gregoires credit line is frayed to the point of unraveling. He fields cell phone calls like a goalie fending off swarms of free kicks. And his little indie operation is about to be invaded by a small army of Korean filmmakers wholl need logistical support that the office staff cant provide. In the midst of this steady-state chaos Gregoire manages to stay cool radiate charm and keep his wry sense of humor. Hes also wise enough to set aside precious time for his Italian-born wife Sylvia (Chiara Caselli) and their three lovely daughters one of whom is on the cusp of young womanhood. Still watching Gregoire in action starts you wondering how long he can survive both financially and emotionally and how much of his devotion to the cause of his independent films is sustained by denial or self-delusion. Such questions arise without any prompting from Ms. Hansen-Love who writes and directs with flawless finesse or from the casual virtuoso who plays Gregoire. Louis-Do de Lencquesaing gives a performance of understated brilliance one that keeps our feelings about his character in constant flux. Thats a quietly daring approach to acting. Sometimes we can see Gregoire as the ardent young man he once was. At other times its easy to imagine the stressed-out ruin he could become. Occasionally both men seem to exist simultaneously. The filmmakers quiet daring suffuses her view of the whole family. Instead of sticking to predictable drama--the sweet-and-sour smell of success--she turns her attention halfway through to the heros wife and daughters. (I kept hoping wed see more of their oldest girl Clemence whos played exquisitely by Mr. de Lencquesaings own daughter Alice and those hopes were amply rewarded; watch what she does for example with a simple scene about deciding which coffee to order in a cafe.) The films focus comes to be not only the price Gregoires loving family pays for his principled obsession but how they cope with the realization that their life has been built on quicksand. The choice of a closing song is deliciously daring and the cinematography by Pascal Auffray is sharp-eyed and radiant as befits a movie concerned with the movie business. ENLARGE Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton in Prince of Persia The Sands of Time. Disney Prince of Persia The Sands of Time For those of you--of us--whove been rooting for Jake Gyllenhaal to prevail as a romantic hunk in ""Prince of Persia The Sands of Time"" the news is pretty good. He may not be another Douglas Fairbanks or Burt Lancaster but his dashing Dastan drives this action adventure which was directed by Mike Newell with a sense of fun that was missing from ""Robin Hood"" and a winning demeanor that encompasses light irony and poetic melancholy not to mention an earnest but slightly bizarre English accent. Whats more he finds a princess worthy of him in Gemma Arterton who comes by her accent honestly. Shes as English as say Vivien Leigh on whose Cleopatra her fiery character may have been modeled and she complements him perfectly in a succession of scorpions-in-a-bottle scenes that have been written and are performed with genuine elegance. (The princess Tamina goes through almost the whole film in a single and elegant white gown.) The film looks impressive thanks to the burnished gold tones of John Seales cinematography and to the artful employment of digital technology that yields dreamlike evocations of medieval desert vistas. And theres much to enjoy in the flash and clash of some early battles as well as the comical counterpoint of an ostrich race staged by a scruffy hustler who calls himself Sheik Amar; hes played with engaging gusto by Alfred Molina. Yet ""Prince of Persia"" a movie born of a video game is at war with itself and the bad guys win. Theyre the ones responsible for the plot which is a junkyard of Arabian Nights cliches; for the numbing action sequences that feel like identical segments of an endless loop; and for a climax of boundless absurdity. The lesson here is simple In the digital realm the bigger the worse. What looks distinctive and believable in short takes and small doses can turn blatantly phony and deadly familiar when the scale is pumped up. ""Prince of Persia"" pumps itself up to the bursting point and bursts. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Road to Morocco (1942) The film wasnt shot in Abu Dhabi but then it wasnt shot in Morocco either. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby are Orville ""Turkey"" Jackson and Jeff Peters stowaways who find themselves castaways following a shipwreck off Paramounts version of the Moroccan coast. When Jeff sells Orville into slavery the slave owner turns out to be a nubile princess played by Dorothy Lamour. As scholarly depictions of Arab culture go ""Road to Morocco"" is on a par with ""Sex and the City 2."" But its a lot more fun and won an Oscar nomination for best original screenplay. ENLARGE Summer Hours (2008) Mia Hansen-Loves previous film isnt available in a DVD format that will play on American players. Instead Ive chosen this fine French-language drama by Olivier Assayas because it offers the chance to see Alice de Lencquesaing in another small but important role. She plays the dying matriarchs teenage granddaughter Sylvie who remembers her grandmas history of love and grand passion and may be destined to repeat it. The film is ostensibly about material things but the filmmakers concern is what the matriarchs objects of art are really worth--their emotional content rather than their market value. ENLARGE Brokeback Mountain (2005) Jake Gyllenhaal and the late Heath Ledger play American cowboys. Mr. Gyllenhaals Jack is a mercurial mix of plain poetic and practical. Mr. Ledgers Ennis is touchingly bleak and self-contained except when rages sweep him. Although the two men love each other passionately they cant live together in the Marlboro Country of the 1960s and 70s so they try to hide their love behind shaky facades of heterosexual domesticity. Ang Lee directed from a superb adaptation of an Annie Proulx short story by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana. With Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams as respectively Jacks and Enniss uncomprehending wives. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Movie Review Sex and the City 2 a bad trip to nowhere washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Sex and the City 2 Movie Review Sex and the City 2 a bad trip to nowhere GallerySex and the City 2 premiere at Radio City Music Hall in New York CityStrap on your stilettos grab a cosmo and join the mayhem New Yorks favorite fashion-forward foursome reunites for the premiere of ""Sex and the City 2."">> LAUNCH PHOTO GALLERY Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Friday May 28 2010 ""Sex and the City"" is was and always will be for the fans. The first movie like the raunchy HBO series on which it was based could be appreciated on its own hedonistic terms but ""Sex and the City 2"" -- an enervated crass and gruesomely caricatured trip to nowhere -- seems conceived primarily to find new and more cynical ways to abuse the loyalty of its audience. (See pictures from the red carpet at the premiere) That is evident from the first strained moments as the movie picks up the story of Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her friends Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) two years after the last film ended. Carrie happily married to Mr. Big (Chris Noth) has been feathering their handsome Upper East Side nest while the others navigate motherhood careers and menopause. As the story takes them inexplicably to a freebie junket in Abu Dhabi the script visits one indignity after another upon ""the girls"" from Mirandas desperate whoops of fake glee to convince herself shes having fun to Samanthas compulsive penchant for dirty puns. While the show and first movie managed to thread a tricky needle between the traditionally girly concerns of clothes shoes and romance and a far more sober clear-eyed view of female solidarity and autonomy ""Sex and the City 2"" uses feminist arguments to preempt the criticism it so richly deserves. Thus Carrie amp; Co. can run amok in Abu Dhabi dressed like the offspring of Barnum amp; Bailey and Alexis Carrington making jokes about burqas and in Samanthas case engaging in exhibitionistic displays that border on the psychotic but to disapprove of their behavior is tantamount to punishing female desire -- or in the films preferred trope ""silencing their voice."" The more strenuously ""Sex and the City 2"" tries to become a parable of trans-national sisterhood the more patronizing and self-important the movie becomes and the more its protagonists come to resemble shrill female impersonators. When Carrie expresses disbelief that a woman in full abaya can still enjoy a french fry the veiled woman in question would be forgiven for taking in Carries own insane get-up and wondering whos the more sartorially oppressed. Casting aside the filmmakers breathtaking cultural insensitivity their astonishing tone-deaf ear for dialogue and pacing and their demented self-serving idea of female empowerment the biggest sin of ""Sex and the City 2"" is its lack of beauty. Its garish when it should be sumptuous tacky when it should be luxe wafer-thin when it should be whip-smart and sophisticated. This movie makes a mockery of the surface pleasures that the original series could always be counted on to provide. The fans most likely will still flock to ""Sex and the City 2"" but they may feel as if theyre being punished for their devotion.  R. At area theaters. Contains strong sexual content and profanity. 140 minutes.

Wholesome family-friendly chains such as Walmart and Target were shoving aside toothpaste and Q-tips to make room for Durex mini-vibrators and a lube called Wet--products more commonly found at the likes of the West Hollywood Hustler store. What prompted the sudden demand? One thing retailers said Sex and the City. The show finally on TBS was flowing like an aphrodisiac into small-town living rooms across the country. It made independence sexy; casual sex empowering and rejecting tradition the norm. (Or something like that.)But dont expect to get your usual fill of women power when SATC 2 hits theaters Thursday--just the opposite. It may begin with a big fabulous gay wedding tackle the insecurities of marriage and culminate in an over-the-top girls vacation to ""the new Middle East"" but SATC 2 is more 1950s gender roles than lipstick-and-Manolos feminism from the moment Carrie and Mr. Big cuddle up five minutes in to watch It Happened One Night circa 1934. The girls dont lack their usual spunk but the film leaves us with the sobering view that even the most independent of women will fall back into traditional roles and needs diamond wedding rings stay-at-home-moms husbands last names. Its telling that the ladies sing ""I Am Woman"" in a karaoke bar and badly at that.The films promising premise is that each character must define her womanly role as Mrs. mother working woman and single gal. Carrie is battling with the title of ""wife"" wondering if--after two years or marriage--her relationship with Mr. Big has fallen into a mundane routine of take-out sushi and shoes up on the couch. Shes caught off guard when the doorman starts calling her Carrie Preston and shes really caught off guard when Mr. Preston announces he needs to spend two nights a week alone. Miranda the resident workaholic is suddenly faced with a terrible sexist boss but rather than stand up to him she walks out the door and into her sons science fair among other domestic delights.. Charlotte the eternal traditionalist is already caving under the pressure to be the perfect mother when Samantha wonders if her young braless bombshell nanny is really a good idea. She should know at 52 Samantha is fighting aging with a fury--and with handfuls of hormone pills and Suzanne Somers health advice. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Remember the old boundary-breaking taboo-toppling Sex and the City? Forget it. Neither sex nor the city plays any role in this film. The primary dramatic tension actually comes from a split-second kiss between Carrie and old-flame Aiden whom she conveniently meets in an Abu Dhabi market. Thats when the roaring women turn into pathetic squeaking girls. Charlotte falls off a camel trying to get Harry on the phone scared hes sleeping with the braless nanny. Carrie immediately reveals her kiss to Big who ultimately forgives her because ""I took a vow""--and gives her a big fat diamond ring to ""remind her that shes married."" Charlotte and Miranda bitch about their kids then raise a glass to the hard work of stay-at-home mothers who do it all--and without help. When all is said and done only Samantha is true to her former libido--and look where it gets her. Pumped full of botox popping hormones like Tic Tacs she gets kicked out of Abu Dhabi for promiscuity narrowly escaping an angry mob. After all those years of redefining female sexuality were suddenly back to the beginning--Samantha has become a slut. Sex and the Desert Hunks harems and steamy sheiks have lit up the silver screen since the dawn of cinema. It is admittedly hard to keep a show relevant after all these years especially one that defined the cultural zeitgeist as SATC did. But its still sad to see the characters go from trailblazers to conformists suddenly telling us that work and child-rearing actually dont mix that its a bling on a ring finger that will prove a union to the world and that we must worry--no matter how stable a marriage--that a husband will cheat. Its fiction we know. But these characters like the lubrication they inspired helped legions of women embrace their own fierceness--and here they are 12 years later nothing more than stereotype and cliche. Of course no woman raised on SATC would ever believe thats really how it all ends.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

"Sex and the City 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sex-and-the-city-2 ) Sex and the City 2 (United States 2010) May 27 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli ""Movies for fans"" (as distinguished from ""fan-made movies"") - motion pictures targeted primarily at aficionados of a series and secondarily at the public - have been around for decades but never has one been as openly dismissive of the general movie-going population as Sex and the City 2. There is little doubt that fans of the TV and cinematic franchise will adore what has been laid before them but its hard to imagine that anyone not self-identifying as a Sex and the City adherent will find this first sequel tolerable. It has no plot to speak of little in the way of wit or intelligence and is about 50% longer than can reasonably be justified. Sex and the City 2 is all set-up with no pay-off. Its bad soap opera and every time it comes close to addressing an interesting issue - such as how the reality of a marriage differs from the idealized preconception of one - it quickly backtracks apologizing along the way for getting serious. Fans will bathe in this sewer of materialistic excess because they appreciate any opportunity to spend time with their favorite characters. Everyone else will stare at the screen in a state of enhanced boredom if the sheer tedium of watching this production doesnt shut down the brain altogether. This review is not meant for fans; those who bother to read it will likely bombard me with poison pen e-mails. Having been a fan myself (albeit not of Sex and the City) I understand the circle-the-wagons mentality. Never before however either looking from without or within the fan sphere have I encountered a movie so contemptuous of those who arent part of the ""in"" crowd. Star Trek Star Wars Harry Potter Twilight... the list goes on and none of those franchises turned its back so completely on outsiders. Even the first Sex and the City movie wasnt this divisive. The most grotesque aspect of Sex and the City remains the central characters all four of whom (to varying degrees) are obsessed with the trappings of wealth. They exist to consume. Its a three-ring circus of materialism narcissism and entitlement. These people are self-absorbed to the point where unless you built a relationship with them during their television days its impossible to like them. The filmmakers not only sympathize with them but laud their avarice and obsession with possessions. Sex and the City 2 is overloaded with product placements (all high-end of course) and wallows in a cultural cesspool that some will find offensive. (A similar problem that existed for Confessions of a Shopaholic.) What other movie spends five minutes providing a tour of an exclusive hotel suite? The fan argument is that this is all fantasy but not every fantasy is healthy and a plausible argument can be made that the one proffered by Sex and the City 2 crosses a line. The film opens by re-introducing us to the Sex and the City foursome two years after the end of their previous movie. They havent moved on - little ever really changes in their hermetically sealed bubble. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is finding wedded bliss with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) to be less than what she expected. He would rather lounge at home on the couch watching TV or reading the newspaper while she would prefer to dress up in costumes designed for women at least ten years younger and paint the town red. When he suggests they spend two days a week apart (as a way to make their five days of togetherness more tolerable) she is crushed. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) now well into her 50s but acting like shes in her 30s continues to live the life of a single libertine engaging in frequent sex with younger men while embracing hormone therapy as a way to mute the undesirable side-effects of menopause. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is finding the parenting of two young girls - one of whom wont stop crying - to be bordering on impossible. The situation becomes worse when she notices her husband (Evan Handler) paying undue attention to the attractive nanny (Alice Eve) who never wears a bra. Finally Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) quits her job as a top-flight attorney when she believes the new senior partner is being dismissive and insulting. After spending the films first half moping around New York City the quartet embarks on a one-week vacation to Abu Dhabi where the action continues at the same sluggish pace. Its astounding how a movie this long could accomplish so little. Sex and the City 2 could qualify as fashion porn - there are endless images of dresses shoes jewelry and so forth - and plenty of shopping spree money shots. There are times when director Michael Patrick Kings cameras linger on the wardrobe and accessories rather than on the actors establishing clearly (as if there was ever a doubt) where his preferences lie. His shot selection is basic - the kind of thing one expects on a television sit-com but not in a movie theater. I have had enough exposure to the HBO series to recognize that one of the hallmarks of the TV program was its wit and freshness. Given a 30-minute time limit scripts were crisp and funny. With all time constraints removed Sex and the City 2 has turned into a bloated aberration. Barely enough content exists in the 145-minute movie for perhaps two mediocre half-hour episodes; theres more filler here than in a can of bargain brand cat food. Its sad to acknowledge that the most energetic sequence in the movie occurs when Carrie Samantha Miranda and Charlotte perform a karaoke rendition of ""I am Woman."" The first Sex and the City movie was marginally watchable. There was a narrative line the characters werent consistently reprehensible and the humor wasnt quite as forced. Sex and the City 2 has taken all that was bad about its predecessor and amplified it. In many movie series the second film is the best; if thats the case for this one I shudder to think what might be next. When it comes to the bottom line theres no difficulty determining who should see Sex and the City 2. Individuals deeply invested in the characters and/or the culture they represent will find something to like about the movie. Others especially heterosexual males who arent trying to win points with a wife/girlfriend will do better following Mr. Bigs example and staying home to watch It Happened One Night although even changing diapers and scouring the toilets would offer a cleaner and more rewarding 2 1/2 hours.

Review Sex and the City 2 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Sex and the City 2 Comedy. Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon. Directed by Michael Patrick King. (R. 144 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The moment of dread. It comes for all beloved series and in ""Sex and the City 2"" it arrives with embarrassing suddenness. Its the moment that tells you that all the ideas have run out and the only thing left is to push the old ideas and bank on audience goodwill. Thus we get the spectacle of Carrie Samantha Miranda and Charlotte - best friends for life - in a karaoke bar in Abu Dhabi performing Helen Reddys ""I Am Woman."" Non-fans may be bored or irritated but for those who really love ""Sex and the City"" those two verses and a chorus are downright excruciating. The song is a transparent attempt to please that doesnt please - and a ham-fisted assertion of feminist credentials in the most self-conscious and trivializing of ways. Moreover the setting a nightclub in a Muslim country is so inappropriate as to border on the grotesque. To be sure if youve spent months looking forward to ""Sex and the City 2"" your affection for the characters will carry you through this 144-minute disappointment and you may even be occasionally diverted. Still be warned If the first ""Sex and the City"" movie was like five episodes of the HBO TV show crammed into one feature ""Sex and the City 2"" is like one episode stretched to the point of madness. Certainly novices should avoid the new film lest they get the wrong idea that the whole thing the whole series was just a big waste of time. The first bad sign is that it starts with a lie albeit a minor one involving ancillary characters Stanford (Willie Garson) and Anthony (Mario Cantone) are getting married. Theyve always hated each other but they are the series gay characters and their union provides the excuse for a gay wedding. What follows is a grotesque spectacle - I used ""grotesque"" earlier but some movies force you to keep using it - with cringe-inducing dialogue and a wedding service performed by Liza Minnelli. Then she sings which is even worse. Twenty minutes in the movie is already operating at a deficit and it never recovers. It cant recover because it never finds something that it wants to say or a story that it needs to tell. Writer-director Michael Patrick King faced a serious dilemma this time and he couldnt resolve it The lives of settled married middle-aged people really dont change much from month to month unless theres a divorce or a disaster. To his credit King has resisted the temptation to kill off his characters but he also knows he cant really mess with his heroines marriages because three of his ladies are nicely paired. So King can only play at the margins He must invent a story and yet in the end leave everything and everybody more or less as they are. This is miserably confining a restriction King never faced when writing the TV show and he takes the easiest way out. He resorts to flash. The women go on a weeks vacation to Abu Dhabi and stay in magnificent and vulgar luxury. But why oh why Abu Dhabi and not Paris or Rio? ""Sex and the City"" has no business relocating to a Muslim nation. The culture clash is too awkward neither funny nor pertinent. Moreover the Abu Dhabi men start becoming more sympathetic than the protagonists. We start seeing them through Third World eyes as rich decadent and spiritually bereft - not the movies intention. Most dishearteningly we start seeing the sexually free Samantha (Kim Cattrall) as utterly pathetic. In one scene she seduces a millionaire businessman by simulating oral sex on a hookah pipe. Get real folks. That would not impress any mature man worth his salt. If a man wants a woman wholl behave in public like a 20-year-old prostitute hell find an actual 20-year-old prostitute. A woman in her 50s can best compete only by being an adult - by being human and interesting. Instead of enabling Samantha and playing into the characters myth of herself King might have depicted her coming into greater awareness. Now that could have been a story. At its best ""Sex and the City"" has always been about exploring the emotional life of women of a particular generation and theres value in a series showing them grow and change over the course of years. The new movie has Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) comparing notes on child rearing Samantha extolling the benefits of bioidentical hormone creams and Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her husband (Chris Noth) dealing with the benefits and challenges of childlessness. But all this good stuff is shoved to the side while in the foreground we get four nitwits flouncing through the desert in high heels. Best to avoid ""Sex and the City 2"" which can only be a bad memory and say goodbye to these ladies at the end of the last movie. Maybe the series isnt dead. Maybe it wont all go out on this banana peel. But it shouldnt come back until one of these characters has something serious to deal with and the filmmaker has something to say about it. -- Advisory Simulated sex strong language.

The bloated sequel is worse than the original which didnt hold a mascara wand to the HBO series.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune May 27 2010 -- 343pm Craig Blankenhorn Warner Bros. Cynthia Nixon (Miranda) Sarah Jessica Parker (Carrie) Kim Cattrall (Samantha) and Kristin Davis (Charlotte) sing a karaoke version of ""I Am Woman."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Hollywood is unfair. Ninety percent of movies are aimed at males between the ages of 12 and 25. Most of the rest are targeted at females in the same age range. Studios dont make many films for people over 30 especially not women. Then when they do they offer something like ""Sex and the City 2"" Barbie for grownups. And heres the kicker. Women are so starved for women-centered films that theyve embraced this stereotypical trifle as an event movie. Though the 2 in the title implies a double shot of everything fans loved about the series there is less. Whatever natural chemistry and witty banter Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) and her handmaidens shared in the HBO TV series is absent here. There is less Sex since three of the four fashionistas are in settled relationships and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) everyones favorite mature skank is swabbing herself with Youth Tonic to reverse the effects of menopause. There is less (New York) City since half the film occurs in Abu Dhabi. And there are smaller comedic ambitions When you see camels you cant count to 20 in your head before the inevitable camel-toe joke. Also diminished is the twig-sized Parker who looks as if she subsists on a diet of martinis and breath mints. Next to her the well-fed Cattrall looks like a blond Stay Puft Marshmallow Woman. Charlotte and Miranda (Kristen Davis and Cynthia Nixon) scarcely register as the quartets third and fourth wheels. And there is no Jennifer Hudson at all as the Oscar-winning actress opted not to reprise her cameo role as Carries assistant. Well played Miss Hudson. You could not call the plot precision-tooled. It opens with a big gay wedding/musical dance number melding the worst aspects of a Fire Island costume ball and a really excessive bar mitzvah. The ceremony features a squadron of chorus boys in white tuxedos and sequined top hats two Liza Minnelli impersonators and the actual Liza. After spending a good quarter-hour focusing on the gala whose ""brooms"" (bride + groom get it?) play no further part in the story you may ask yourself ""Why did that just happen?"" Its a question that recurs throughout the films 146 minutes. As before the acting is abysmal. Davis still performs like a 10-year-old in a talent show that nobody is really interested in seeing. Many years into Parkers career they still havent found the correct angle from which to photograph her. The camera hardens her severe features and her taut smile seems unnatural as if it was Photoshopped onto her kisser. SEX AND THE CITY 2  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for some strong sexual content and language. The story repurposes moth-eaten plotlines. Carrie grapples with a stale relationship as her dreamboat hubby Mr. Big (Chris Noth) becomes a couch potato and old flame Aiden (John Corbett) temptingly reappears. Miranda is being drawn away from her husband and child by the demands of her law practice. Charlotte is overwhelmed by her girls and threatened by their competent cheerful nubile nanny. They fret about the problems Hollywood people have -- losing sexual desirability not spending enough time with the kids. These are the sort of notions that could float a half-hour episode of the TV series but daisy-chaining them does not a 2 1/2-hour film make. The out-of-nowhere trip to the Mideast is a head-scratcher. Samantha announces ""I can feel the decadence"" demonstrating a wobbly grasp of Muslim social values. Once there she behaves with a self-important arrogance topped only by her colossal ignorance. Her smug assumption that shes incredibly hot timeless and irresistible to men could have set up some great jokes. Except for one quick gag featuring Miley Cyrus that wish-fulfillment fantasy goes unchallenged. Cattralls character takes on the mantle of a 21st-century Mae West or a female Austin Powers a goofy artifact of swingin sexism but writer/director Michael Patrick King seems to view her as a figure of female empowerment. As a result its hard to sympathize when she gets into hot water. All I can say is if you go to Abu Dhabi to wear hot pants and do lewd pelvic thrusts at the locals while waving a belt-length pack of Trojans you probably deserve what you get.

"Sex and the City 2 movie review Sex sequel leaves New York City and much of its sparkle behind |       NJ.com comments Sex and the City 2 movie review Sex sequel leaves New York City and much of its sparkle behind Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 26 2010 at 902 AM updated May 26 2010 at 946 AM View/Post Comments Craig BlankenhornFrom left Cynthia Nixon Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis take to the stage of an Abu Dhabi karaoke bar for a rendition of ""I Am Woman"" in ""Sex and the City 2.""Sex and the City 2"" is a movie set during the recession in which none of its high-living characters worry about bills designer outfits are changed several times a day and everyone stays in a hotel where the daily room rate is more than many people make in a year. And if you think theres something wrong with that you dont understand the franchise. Thats because ""Sex and the City"" isnt just about female friendship but escapism a pretty daydream of extravagant couture and attentive hunks. It is wish-fulfillment not realism -- and no more out of place now than Fred and Ginger were during the Depression. Being frivolous isnt the problem. Being frivolous is the point.Sex and the City 2 (R) Warner Bros. /New Line (147 min.) Directed by Michael Patrick King. With Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Cynthia Nixon Kristin Davis Chris Noth. Opens tomorrow at 1201 a.m. in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys rating Two stars Rating note The film contains nudity sexual situations strong language and alcohol abuse. The problem with this sequel -- and it is problematic -- is that it forgets something more basic. Because the show wasnt just about sex. It was also about the city. And while this film keeps the heat it adds the desert moving everything to Abu Dhabi. Talk about taking a wrong turn. The idea is that its characters need a break -- Carrie from a beginning-to-bore marriage Samantha from feeling old Miranda from a career shes ambivalent about and Charlotte from her own overwhelming insecurities as a mother. Okay fine. But a jaunt to the Middle East? Who came up with that idea? ""Hey you know what this needs? More Ishtar"" Its clearly meant as a cheap way to score easy points about female empowerment. There are plenty of references to religious repression and at one point our heroines take over a karaoke bar and sing -- no Im not kidding -- ""I Am Woman."" But all it ends up being nothing but cheap and easy -- and thats saying a lot in a movie with Samantha Jones. Admitted the clothes are mostly great particularly those on star (and producer) Sarah Jessica Parker who sports a smashing newsprint dress from Dior and heels so high they should have their own elevators. The film also provides fans with heavily muscled young men and a few bitchy almost topical jokes. And there are the four women whose characters are so distinctly drawn they long ago became a walking Cosmo quiz. (Are you a Miranda or a Charlotte? See Page 185) The actresses themselves arent very well served though. Kim Cattrall is overly made up and her once-randy Samantha is now merely vulgar -- a drag queens idea of a woman. Kristin Davis who has only one expression anyway -- mouth open eyes wide in surprise -- spends most of the movie looking well surprised. Cynthia Nixon meanwhile just seems tired and her character is barely developed. And while Parker does all the heavy lifting dramatically some of what shes lugging around seems ironically lightweight and full of barely motivated melodrama. There are some things that feel like the old series. Theres a wonderfully over-the-top wedding. Theres a surprising performance of ""Single Ladies"" (which could have been the shows after-the-fact theme song) and some early shots of Manhattan where the Chrysler Building glitters like Carries nameplate necklace. But thats what this movie needed more of -- the Magnolia Bakery and Park Slope mommies walk-in closets and the ""walk of shame"" Manhattan men who just arent that into you and Gotham girls who stick together. Its supposed to be ""Sex and the City."" This is ""Sects and the Souk.""

"The second Sex and the City movie is even worse than the first. Slate Sign In Sign Up The second Sex and the City movie is even worse than the first. The second Sex and the City movie is even worse than the first. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 27 2010 910 PM Sex and the City 2 Even worse than the first movie. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Sex and the City 2 check out our Spoiler Special discussion You can also download the program here or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Sex and the City 2 Two movies opening this week chronicle the dying gasps of a decadent empire Alejandro Amenabars Agora and Michael Patrick Kings Sex and the City 2 (Warner Bros.). Of the pair Agora which concerns the destruction of the library at Alexandria is the better movie (in this case a very low bar to clear). But Sex and the City is in its way a more vivid portrait of historical decline. The last (oh please God let it be the last) installment of the franchise takes place in an abyss of material excess and spiritual loneliness where Bergdorf shopping sprees take the place of gorging on larks tongue. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I confess to a soft spot for the four principal characters of the original HBO series which always sought to wed economic privilege to feel-good feminism. Carrie Samantha Miranda and Charlotte were successful single women in New York City empowered consumers in a marketplace of goods and men. Unbound by any law but their own pleasure they had the freedom to design their own romantic fate. It was an absurd libertarian fantasy to be sure--Ayn Rand in Chanel and pumps--but in half-hour weekly doses it was not without its appeal. And even though there was something abidingly icky about the shows reverence for wealth prestige and brand names the portrait of female friendship at its center rang true even for some women not in possession of ""it"" bags or Manhattan real estate. Advertisement The first movie didnt entirely succeed in translating that SATC spark to the screen--it was too long and too self-indulgent with a Cinderella ending that undercut the storys emotional truth. It was however a chance for those of us who harbored warm memories of the show to revisit the characters in their settled post-single lives and wish them well. Why then this morbid two-and-a-half-hour attempt to reanimate the series corpse? The answer of course is the same as the solution this movie offers for all of lifes problems money. Two years after her marriage to her long-elusive dream guy Mr. Big (Chris Noth) Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is ensconced in a palatial Fifth Avenue apartment (she also keeps her old place across town as a seldom-used pied-a-terre the first sign that this movie is economically off its rocker). But the compromises of conjugal life nag at her Why wont he get off the couch and come out to glamorous events with her anymore? Is the best anniversary gift he can think of really a second TV? Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is content with her husband and son in Brooklyn but miserable at her corporate law job. Charlotte a stay-at-home mother of two is quietly going nuts and beginning to harbor suspicions about the intentions of her buxom Irish nanny. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) having sworn off monogamy forever is still pursuing erotic bliss via random hookups and eternal youth via hormonal supplements. In an opening set piece Carries best gay friend Stanford (Willie Garson) marries Charlottes best gay friend Anthony (Mario Cantone) in a wedding so over-the-top it appears to have been production-designed by Van Nest Polglase. Though it lacks any real laughs this sequence bodes a better movie than the one that eventually follows. Liza Minnelli pops up to deliver a campy reperformance of the choreography from Beyonces ""All the Single Ladies"" and one of the grooms raises a question that represents the movies path not taken. Making the rounds at the reception the loudmouthed Anthony boasts to his scandalized straight friends that hes been given permission by his husband-to-be to cheat under certain circumstances. But the issue of Anthony and Stanfords fidelity policy is never revisited--indeed theyre barely seen again--and the heterosexual model of monogamy with its accompanying triangulation and handwringing is the one that drearily prevails. For the first hour or so the movie meanders around New York moping. The egregious awfulness doesnt kick in until Samantha a PR flack gets invited on an all-expenses-paid junket to Abu Dhabi by a sheik who wants her to represent his luxury hotel. For a good 20 minutes the plot comes to a complete stop as the girls ooh and aah over first-class plane cabins hotel grounds of Versailles-like proportions and dusky manservants. This section resembles nothing so much as one of those glossy 20-page ""advertorials"" that sometimes appear in the Sunday Times magazine touting the cosmopolitan lifestyle and business-friendly tax policies of some Middle Eastern nation or other. In a movie thats chockablock with product placement (Rolex Dior Maybach) the Abu Dhabi scenes feel like an extended plug for an entire country (though its not clear which one since the actual location shooting was done in Morocco). Eventually something besides the admiration of commodities does take place in Abu Dhabi but lets just say the stakes are so low that during the girls final madcap sprint through an outdoor market disguised in burqas the unspeakable outcome theyre trying to forestall is the possibility of having to fly home in coach. Advertisement In his sharp assessment of SATC2 Matt Zoller Seitz calls the film ""an accidental candid snapshot of the sick dying heart of America."" (DVD packagers you have your blurb) And its true that this movies absolute tone-deafness its complete disconnection from our current economic and geopolitical reality by moments achieves a perverse Warholian profundity. In one scene Carrie asks her personal hotel butler Guarau (Raza Jaffrey) about his family. His wife is back in India he tells her; he flies home to see her every few months when he can afford the fare. Carrie looks at him for a moment in silence and we wonder Is it possible shes confronting the unimaginable gulf that separates their two lives the vast global network of consumption exploitation and injustice thats brought them together in this alien and alienating place? But no Although she will later do Guarau a good turn Carrie is merely wondering how she can get Big to appreciate her as much. Perched at the pinnacle of material comfort and social privilege in the waning days of the American empire she can still find something to pout about.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Twelve years one beloved HBO series and two feature films on the ""Sex and the City gals have been reduced to Bratz dolls for grown women. Even the shoes seem snap-on and dont ask about the emotions. What was once a playful pretend-shallow soap opera with pockets of feeling is now shallow for keeps -- a dunderheaded comic melodrama with clothes to die for and dialogue to shrink from. Its downright depressing.Dolls belong in the playroom and Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) Samantha (Kim Cattrall) Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) belong in New York City or rather that fairy-tale Manhattan envisioned by writer Candace Bushnell and series producer Darren Star. Its a place where couture dresses are always one paycheck within reach where long town cars with eligible businessmen purr outside where the sex is great and the lunches never end. As fantasies go it was irresistible; maybe its even more so in a recession.The great mistake of ""Sex and the City 2 then is to send its characters out of New York and into the United Arab Emirates for a weeklong all-expenses-paid vacation at a swank Abu Dhabi hotel. Just so were clear on this Four fun-loving American fashionistas descend upon a country where their lifestyle and clothing choices would get them whipped if they were citizens where earlier this month a woman who reported being raped by six men was charged with illegal sex and faces life in prison. But what does that matter when you can ride a camel across the desert in your Christian Louboutins?For the first 60 minutes of its punishing 2 1/2-hour running time while the charac ters are still in New York ""SATC2 is acceptable and even entertaining. The movie opens with the wedding of the groups pet homosexuals (really every girl should have one) Anthony (Mario Santone) and Stanford (Willie Garson) and the ceremony is so enthusiastically over the top that you gladly give in. To see Liza Minnelli -- whats left of her -- jazzhand her way through a rendition of Beyonces ""Single Ladies is to access a plane of high camp known only to the finer female impersonators.Soon though were bogged down in the problems of real life as experienced by pampered urban women. Actually the stresses faced by Charlotte and Miranda as they deal with colicky toddlers chauvinistic bosses braless nannies and weary spouses are realistic and amusing enough to score a few points and Samanthas battles with menopause -- she packs enough hormones in her purse to start a bio-engineering lab -- are broadly funny.But what are we to do with Carrie the once-smart author who the feature films have turned into a ninny? Now married to Mr. Big (Chris Noth patient as the tides) Carrie cant stomach staying in two nights running and her refusal to allow her husband even to watch TV in bed is annoying rather than cute. Her doubts are reflected in the title of her latest book ""I Do Do I? but what might make for an insightful look into marital ambivalence in another film (or on the TV show) sounds only like whining here. When Big suggests two nights off a week you hardly blame him.And when our heroine gets to Abu Dhabi and encounters old flame Aidan (John Corbett the bland go-to stud of chick flicks) the stage is set for more of the forced emotional dilemmas that made the first film seem so strained. (Remember when Carries wedding to Big was canceled because they couldnt reach each other on the phone?)Thats the least of the movies problems. Belly-dancers and all ""SATC2 parlays a gaga tourista vision of the Middle East that hasnt changed since the days of Rudolph Valentino and the insertion of four Ugly Americans into a Muslim capital makes for weird dissonances rather than light comedy. How are we supposed to read the scene in which Samantha incurs the wrath of a crowd of Arab men by disrobing in a marketplace after a hot flash?Or how about the nightclub sequence where the characters perform a karaoke rendition of Helen Reddys ""I Am Woman? There are so many levels of unintended irony there -- glitzy Western narcissists singing a feminist anthem in a country with a notably lousy record on womens rights -- that the mind boggles. That scene was shot on a Brooklyn set by the way and the rest of the Middle East scenes in Morocco. It seems Abu Dhabi couldnt handle even the script for this movie.Oh right its all meant to be in fun. Well good luck with that. The first ""Sex and the City film was such a girls-night-out pop event that it was easy for fans to overlook the fact that the movie itself was awful. Theyll have to work a lot harder this time. All movies require suspension of disbelief but ""Sex and the City 2 drives a crueler bargain. It asks that we be as brainless as everyone onscreen.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Over six seasons on HBO Sex And The City at the very least deserves credit for developing four distinct memorable female characters drawn sharply enough that fans actually identify themselves as ""a Carrie"" or ""a Miranda."" Sex And The City 2 panders to that audience to the point of self-destruction squandering whatever goodwill the franchise had left after the first so-so movie by plopping its beloved characters into a series of garish vignettes that throw their shallowness into sharp relief. By the point where proud menopausal jezebel Samantha stands shrieking in the middle of a Middle Eastern marketplace while waving magnum condoms and flipping off hijab-clad Muslims on their way to prayer its inconceivable that anyone would want to even be in the presence of ""a Samantha"" much less be one. The film reaches that nadir after a meandering two-plus hours that purport just like the first movie to show what happens ""after happily ever after."" SATC2s first half is structured more around fan service than plot A gratuitous 80s flashback montage blurs into an over-the-top wedding between the series two gay characters (complete with an embarrassing-for-all-involved Liza Minnelli performance) which melts into a red-carpet sequence rife with couture and celebrity cameos. Amid the eye candy each characters conflict is perfunctorily addressed Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) has lost the ""sparkle"" from her marriage; Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is having trouble balancing work and family; Charlottes (Kristin Davis) kids are driving her crazy; and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is battling menopause. Rather than dealing with these issues like real human beings the four jet off on a ludicrously extravagant vacation to Abu Dhabi and the movie completely unravels into a pastiche of wish-fulfillment slapstick and ham-handed social commentary. The characters engagement with Muslim culture is lazily conceived and often painful to watch as when Parker gawps at a woman eating french fries under her veil or Cattrall fellates a hookah pipe. The movie justifies these moments with a pro-female message that goes no further than acknowledging that all women regardless of culture love fashion and enjoy karaoke sing-alongs of ""I Am Woman."" Similarly the movies attempts to downplay its unbridled opulence with throwaway lines addressing the poor housing market and ""this bullshit economy"" are insulting rather than ingratiating. Even the crackerjack quippery that was once a Sex And The City hallmark has become so lazy that observations as hoary as ""Toto I dont think were in Kansas anymore"" and ""Erin go braless"" make the cut. SATC2 occasionally redeems itself with a small character moment or interaction that hearkens back to the aspirational everywoman appeal that was the television shows foundation but there isnt nearly enough of it to support the mounds of toxic froth piled atop it. Without any real emotional center SATC2 collapses under the weight of its embellishments.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Sex and the City 2 Video Rated R  147 minutes  2010 Clotheshorse and relationship journalist Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) frets that her marriage to Mr. Big (Chris Noth) is going stale when on their second anniversary he presents her with a nice plasma-screen TV instead of more fucking jewelry. Shes still worrying about this as she and her gal pals fly to Abu Dhabi to be pampered by pretty servile young men in an ultra-luxurious hotel though their idyll of shopping champagne spa treatments and leering single-entendres abruptly explodes when randy Samantha (Kim Cattrall) and a handsome Danish architect violate local standards of decency on the hotel beach. Thanks to writer-director Michael Patrick King I now have a fair idea how it might feel to be stoned to death with scented candles.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday May 26 2010 800AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Sex and the City 2 Directed and written by Michael Patrick King Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Cynthia Nixon Kristin Davis Classification 18A Just a few reasons why Sex and the City 2 deserves one-half a shining star (1) Its got a title punctuated by a number Hey that little digit 2 is a sturdy pillar of the franchise going forward and such an imaginative yet nonetheless practical extension of the Brand. (2) Its got sex Actually it doesnt but Im guessing that No Sex and the City wouldnt have promoted the Brand quite as well. Admittedly the horny blonde the cougar of the franchises female quartet does her libidinous best but having warded off cancer and now battling the encircling demons of menopause the odds and those damned hot flashes are decidedly against her. (3) Its got cities Yes plural. New York of course was always the foursomes home base in those distant days when the Brand was a TV series and worth watching when the gal-pal bonding acted as a sometimes intriguing mirror for the collective bond among Manhattanites themselves - in both cases so urbane and yet so touchingly provincial too. Anyway here on the large screen the Big Apple is as shiny and wormy as ever. So its nice to see the girls leave their smug nest flying off to Abu Dhabi at the behest of a filthy-rich Arab apparently keen on terrorizing the world with his ostentatious wealth. Why Abu Dhabi? Far as I can tell so that one of those suave New Yorkers can touch down and shout ""Abu Dhabi Do"" (4) Its got clothes Yep and shoes too. I do believe the outerwear and the footwear all boast labels from designers whose names I should know but dont. Forgive my ignorance but rest assured that the brands within the Brand are all present and accounted for and proudly displayed. (5) Its got clothes horses That would be the Gang of Four whose job it is to model the aforementioned apparel while as they gracefully age continue their cultural role as touchstones for an entire generation. Some members of that generation may be pleased to know that horny Samantha remains lecherously single but well see above. The others one might recall are all married now although with different clouds on their respective horizons. The judicious Miranda has just banged her head on the glass ceiling in a prestigious law firm. The preppy Charlotte is worried that shes less perfect than her perfectly braless nanny and that her hubby may have an imperfect pair of wandering eyes. The bouncy Carrie a.k.a. the leader of the pack is wondering what comes after happily-ever-after. Wedded for two years her heart has its desire but damn desire is an insatiable beast. Problems always the problems. Sounds like its time for a girls getaway to Abu Dhabi Do. (6) Its got little In the way of a distracting plot that is. Instead that veteran of the franchise writer-director Michael Patrick King is a wily button-pusher ever careful not to press so hard as to contaminate the perfumed concept with anything resembling actual content. Nope the Brand sells itself. Presumably those shoes and frocks will do just fine too. (7) Its got big 147 minutes worth of big. (8) Its got Mr. Big Or if you prefer Mr. Carrie Bradshaw whos still in the mix. Really though all the male characters are essentially just window-dressing in this franchise but since that decorative job has traditionally been womens work in the movies suck it up guys - turnaround is fair play. (9) Its got a big wedding Right at the start too with a choir and Busby Berkeley dancers and more swans than Stratford and two besotted grooms. Yep the franchise does to gay guys precisely what its always done to single women - benignly caricature them. (10) Its got Arabs Benignly caricatured. (11) Its got Miley Miley Cyrus to be precise who pops up ostensibly to play Miley Cyrus but really as a sop to that more callow generation of women who might just look at this Gang of Four and wonder ""Like who are these middle-aged narcissists and did they used to be somebody?"" But the best most irrefutable reason why Sex and the City 2 deserves one-half a shining star Its worse than Sex and the City 1 and that alone is a remarkable achievement. Sex and the City 2 opens in select theatres Wednesday and across Canada on Thursday.

But does that mean it has to seem as long as Lawrence of Arabia?Everything about this sequel is too something - too long too extravagant too predictable too stereotyped too glib too superficial and finally just too too much. Of course thats supposed to be the essential fun of Sex and the City all the froufrou flashy deliciously decadent over-the-topness of it all.In the HBO series and the first big-screen rollout of the SATC experience writer-director Michael Patrick King was able to serve up all those endless spoonfuls of sugar by making sure there was always some solid core of fantasy-piercing feelings something resonantly and recognizably warm and human beneath all the fizz and fantasy. Movie Information Sex and the City 2RatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Michael Patrick KingStarring Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Cynthia Nixon Kristin Davis Chris Noth and John CorbettRun time 146 minutesMPAA rating R (strong sexuality nudity language)Synopsis Carries saga continues.More movies from GuideLive.comThats all but eradicated in this sequel. As it meanders along SATC 2 is barely a movie. Its more a series of set pieces designed to showcase the franchises signature elements - the endless high-fashion ensembles the gilded-age luxury the fabulous lifestyles and the snarky-sweet sisterhood.Rather than saving the best for last the movie opens with it in the form of a lavish wedding. It looks like a coronation but in fact its the wedding between Carries best gayfriend Stanford (Willie Garson) and Charlottes best gayfriend Anthony (Mario Cantone). Theres a mens chorus singing ""Sunrise Sunset"" and Liza Minnelli giving the vows before a Vegas-scaled floor show in which she belts out Beyonces signature song ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It).""The movie tries the same old tricks giving each of the quartet a life problem to work through. For Charlotte (Kristin Davis) its the emotional sinkhole of early parenthood; for Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) its the struggle to balance work and family; for Samantha (Kim Cattrall) its menopause and sexuality; and for iconic Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) its about not wanting to let the perfect life with her perfect love turn her/them into a boring old couple. Wow with problems like that who needs happiness?Like a plastic surgeon storyteller King keeps trying to find new ways to lift and tighten his characters but they have become garish caricatures of themselves. Each of the four central characters sounds and acts at best ridiculous at this point. And in the case of Samantha maniacally clinging to her swingers sex life and Carrie fussing and fuming about the settled state of her life with Mr. Big (Chris Noth) they now come off as unbelievably spoiled and unevolved brats.The four take off for Abu Dhabi so that the movie can escape the depressing economic downturn in America (it keeps making sympathetic comments about it in a seeming effort to inoculate itself from objections of insensitivity) and revel in the otherworldly opulence of an oil-rich state. Thus the movie makes sure we find out that along with four Maybach limos and the four private butlers that our foursome enjoy the hotel suite they stay in costs 22000 a day. The setting also provides an easy source of dramatic tension and rise-above heroics in the culture clash between these 21st-century women and all those medieval men.In the midst of all this Carrie runs into long-lost love Aidan (John Corbett) and has her new book panned in The New Yorker while Charlotte obsesses over her husband having an affair with the nanny. And so on. Lots of balls are tossed in the air but none of them ever hits home. And in the meantime we have the endless orgy of clothes (what came to be called the franchises fashion porn). During one half-day lunch trip to the desert for example the gang goes through three wardrobe changes each more preposterous than the last.To borrow an observation from one of Marges sisters on The Simpsons  ""the older they get the cuter they aint."" editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

(Warner Bros. Pictures) by Carrie Rickey Film Critic Twitter icon carrierickey Close icon Carrie Rickey Film Critic Mail icon carriedrickeygmail.com Twitter icon carrierickey Those Sex and the City fashionistas Carrie Charlotte Miranda and Samantha are high priestesses of the church of friendship. In the sequel to their 2008 big-screen triumph each knows its time for an ""interfriendtion."" Thats SATC-speak for intervention as in Get girlfriend off runaway train and back on track. More about Sex and the City 2 >> Sex and the City 2 is a champagne cocktail on a runaway train -- fizzy sparkly giddy-making and splashing all over the place. At nearly 2 hours much of it at an Abu Dhabi resort hotel that resembles Vegas without neon but with burqas the film could use an ""interfriendtion"" or four. It doesnt know where its going and there are many gasp-worthy laughs getting there. (There are also just as many gasp-worthy elements that push the envelope for an R-rated movie. Outside of soft-core erotica one does not often encounter so many crotch shots of men. But I digress.) Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) has published a new book I Do or Do I? a consideration of a marriage that like the younger daughter of Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is experiencing the terrible twos. These chums got what they wanted but arent sure that they want it anymore. Similarly newly happy-with-hubby Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) is now unhappy at work with a sexist boss and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is lost in ""the menopause maze."" To the extent that the movie has a point its about their struggle to get the spark sparkle -- and libido -- back. Mostly writer/director Michael Patrick King deploys his four stars as luxury brands who from Cuisinart to YSL essentially endorse and model other luxury brands. Every logo and label gets its loving close-up (and is more attentively lit it must be said than the stars whose skin resembles wax fruit). It also must be said that King is not a fluid filmmaker which makes his long movie seem even longer than it is. His sequences have a ba-da-bing rhythm and not in a good way. He typically begins with a long shot of his stars (or star) in full body followed by a close-up of their/her outfit and capped by a reveal to show that even their/her accessories have accessories. Yet the rhythm that makes the visuals so perfunctory can be a good setup for jokes. One involving physics and Liza Minnelli is particularly funny. Another as married-with-children Charlotte and Miranda trade mommy horror stories they stop to toast all the moms without their privileges. Considerably less funny is the repartee about Muslim female modesty delivered by these let-it-all-hang-out Yanks. It might set back Arab-American relations by centuries. Still its not the fashion or the funny or the fornication that makes SATC 2 potent despite its many flaws. Its the characters. The advantage that TV has over feature film is that it shows principals over a long period of time and in multiple contexts. Like Kirk and Spock on Star Trek we know Carrie Miranda et al. and are curious about how these figures will meet new conflicts and challenges. Nixon whose Miranda was so whiny in the last SATC film is particularly winning in this one. Parker once again is the cranky friend who can walk in five-inch heels but is easily tripped up by minuscule problems. In this featherlight fantasy where women eat and never gain weight drink and never get tipsy wear clothes that only billionairesses can afford (and never get wrinkled) the four women have two rules to live by (1) Label clothes not people; (2) girls just want to have friend. That resonates. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com. Read her blog ""Flickgrrl"" at http//www.philly.com/philly/blogs/flickgrrl/.

Nature Tuesday May 25 2010 at 4 a.m. By Ella Taylor 1 Justin Biebers grandmother and her three friendsCraig Blankenhorn A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Say what you will Michael Patrick King knows how to stage a fabulous gay nuptial. Sex and the City 2 begins with flair and good humor at the wedding of Stanford (Willie Garson) and Anthony (Mario Cantone) complete with a gay mens chorus in white top-and-tails crooning a tastefully low-key ""Sunrise Sunset"" Carrie and Big in his-and-hers tuxes and the girl-gang beaming best wishes for the happy couple.So far so charming at least until Liza Minnelli--as the rabbi after a fashion--shows up to hoof a little number wearing someone elses face and flanked by twin younger versions of herself. Im sorry but a 64-year-old woman in a shirt worn over tights is not a happy sight no matter how good she once was at this. You want to avert your eyes for her sake--and be warned theres more of that coming in SATC2.I get that ""dignity be damned"" is a mantra for writer-director King who wants to let us know every five minutes that he just loves women. But its one thing to create a group of BFFs who have become in their way post-millennium pop female icons as beloved as Mary Richards and Rhoda Morgenstern were in the late 1970s. Its quite another to drag them well into middle age dress them like mutton passing as lamb and lumber them with female troubles culled straight from the mommy or single lady blogs.Having cracked the forgiveness thing in SATC1 Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) faces new work-life challenges Making partner at her shiny corporate law firm has brought her a hostile new boss. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is fielding two children one of whom is a chronic weeper and the potential threat of a comely Irish nanny (Alice Eve) with a free-swinging bosom. What to do when your fear of losing the help outruns your terror of her seducing hubbie? Meanwhile Samantha continues to play the sex-crazed cougar and its getting old in every way as she gobbles vitamins and estrogen-rich yams to counter hot flashes and maintain her drive for young studs with washboard abs.As for Carrie Sarah Jessica Parker is now 45 years old and frankly I cannot stomach another moment of the simpering mincing hair-tossing eyelash-batting little-girl shtick shes been pulling ever since she emerged with considerably more verve and charm as a high-colonic Malibu Barbie opposite Steve Martin in L.A. Story. It goes without saying that Carrie has been assigned the movies big-ticket issue What to do with marriage once the newlywed bliss is over especially if you dont want children? Thats a very good question but one thats promptly dumbed down with bogus dilemmas trumped-up crises and much ancillary footwear chatter. Once the happy pair has feathered their cozy little nest a cavernous pad with the requisite ballroom-size closet it turns out that Big is a homebody whos had it poor boy with the fancy restaurants and glam gallery openings and wants nothing more than to cuddle up with Carrie and the flat-screen television.Whats a writer-girl who happens to be finishing a book that heaps scorn on traditional marriage to do about all this loss of conjugal bling? Why talk it to death in ever-decreasing circles of inconsequential angst then head for Abu Dhabi (Morocco actually but all those countries look the same dont they?). There exactly as youd expect await 90 minutes of the four Fs--fashion food furnishings and fornication--plus scads of cringe-making Middle Eastern stereotypes wrapped in a nominal shout-out to oppressed Arab women who guess what like Versace and suffer from hot flashes just like us. For bonus sub-plotting Carrie runs into an old flame (John Corbetts Aidan) and they kiss. No tongue or anything below the waist but--major marital flare-up. Can the sparkle be saved or will it subside into a mature glow?Having raked in 400 million for the first SATC King can pretty much write his own ticket which may explain why the sequel runs a crushing 146 minutes. But hes a TV guy not a movie guy. Like its predecessor SATC2--with a script thats basically a sack full of not very funny gag-lines wrapped in strung-together episodic mini-scenes--is not suited to be a movie. What makes this one especially unbearable though is the way Kings palpable affection for women--the more neurotic the better--in the HBO series has curdled into a kind of chortling malice with sadistic close-ups of faces too old for their fuck-me junior attire and problems 15 years too young. Theres a goofily charming sequence in an Abu Dhabi nightclub when all four women with backup from a team of voluptuous Arab belly-dancers sing their own sweet straight version of ""I Am Woman (Hear Me Roar)."" Too bad the rest is a self-indulgent whimper.

Posted May 26 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT Mood swings similar to those experienced by menopausal Samantha are a common side effect of exposure to Sex and the City 2. Two and a half hours () spent in the company of fortysomething Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) Charlotte York-Goldenblatt (Kristin Davis) and Miranda Hobbes (Cynthia Nixon) and fiftysomething Samantha Jones (Kim Cattrall) takes a toll The experience of listening to the girls complain about their fairy-tale lives from the comfort of an all-expenses-paid luxury vacation in the Arabian desert may leave a viewer feeling by turns nostalgic disoriented and impatient. Dont worry. This is a normal response to revisiting an essence-of-1990s-NYC experience and seeing it through 2010 eyes. And its a natural reaction given that in turning the blinged-out foursome into garish caricatures of their already outlandish selves it seems the producers are just not that into us. Once upon a time Carrie Charlotte Miranda and Samantha represented an ? extravagant (white) fantasy of sophisticated city-that-never-sleeps sisterhood. They were Manolod ambassadors from a world of Manhattan glamour and cosmos who underneath their finery were recognizable as real types of women in an American urban world. Now? Well the friends still look porelessly fine. And Im delighted that in an antidote to recession frugality their wardrobe budget hasnt taken a hit. But in SATC2 whether the topic is gay marriage discussed at the over-the-top wedding of Carries Best Gay Friend (Willie Garson) to Charlottes own BGF (Mario Cantone) or gender roles in the complicated United Arab Emirate of Abu Dhabi explored on a camel the conversation has been reduced to a string of quips. ""Its Bedouin Bath amp; Beyond"" Carrie chirps about amenities in a luxurious desert oasis. ""Lawrence of my labia"" Samantha purrs -- ewww -- about an attractive man observed driving across the dunes. Writer-director Michael Patrick King compulsively jams pun after groaner pun into the script tipping ? the ladies lifestyles and life issues perilously into cartoon territory done better by Jennifer Saunders and Joanna Lumley on BBCs Absolutely Fabulous. Three of the four have uninteresting but reasonable problems Charlotte is upset that motherhood is hard; Miranda is upset that shes unappreciated at work; Samantha is upset that she cant outrun menopause. The fourth takes the cupcake Carrie is upset because shes got everything including marriage to Big (Chris Noth) a new book and a humongous closet and now shes... what? Spoiled and bored we cant help but think. (""Is this because Im a bitch wife who nags you?"" Carrie wheedles when Big asks for some space; at the screening I attended the audience answered aloud Yes.) Yet with the exception of Miranda (who honestly is far too mature and engaged in the world to still hang with these me-me-me gals) not one of the fashion fiends lifts her head out of her luggage to get a clue. While Miranda reads up on Abu Dhabi and learns to speak basic courtesies in Arabic Charlotte scrambles like an American maniac in search of clear cell-phone reception. Samantha is still at it with the horny shtick She insults her hosts as she rails against not being allowed to dress as trampy as she wants. Carrie still cant get over the awful fact that while she gave Big an expensive vintage wristwatch for their second anniversary he gave her a high-end flat-screen TV installed in their bedroom so they could watch old black-and-white movies together. Together. As if the gesture were an insult rather than an offer to share something anything other than nights out on the town. Its of passing interest to note that all the male characters who make return visits -- including John Corbett as Carries ex David Eigenberg as Mirandas husband Evan Handler as Charlottes husband and Jason Lewis as Samanthas actor boy-toy -- are so nice and mild and understanding and accommodating that they fade into invisibility. SATC2 doesnt have time to follow any relationships other than those among Carrie Samantha Charlotte Miranda and their suitcases full of costumer Patricia Fields caftan-themed creations. As Carrie might type on her laptop while giving one of her girly little shrugs When did Sex and the City become so long and mean so little?

Photo Craig Blankenhorn As tasteless as an Arabian cathouse as worn-out as your 1998 flip-flops and as hideous as the mom jeans Carrie wears with a belly-baring gingham top ""Sex and the City 2"" is two of the worst movies of the year. The transformation of the girls from winsome wisecrackers into whiny bling-obsessed chuckleheads is complete. After an endless 20-minute prologue at a gay wedding where Liza Minnelli croaks out ""Single Ladies"" Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) complains that her hubby (Chris Noth) puts his feet on the furniture watches too much TV and wont go to parties -- then throws a fit when at a premiere he chats up Penelope Cruz. PHOTOS SEX AND THE CITY 2 FILMING IN NY MORE SATC2 RED CARPET STYLE Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) remains a corporate bore while Charlotte (Kristin Davis) frets for no reason that her husband might have an affair with their hot Irish nanny and bursts into tears when her daughter stains her Valentino skirt -- while making muffins. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) gripes about hitting menopause as 53-year-old women so often do yet finds herself swarmed by muscled hotties. She soothes everyone with a free trip to an Abu Dhabi resort where the rooms are worth 22 grand a night. Carrie actually delivers the line ""Toto I dont think were in Kansas anymore"" and writer-director Michael Patrick Kings pun dependence becomes as unbearable as the gilt decor. ""Im going to turn this inter-friend-tion into an inter-fun-tion"" . . . ""Bedouin bath and beyond"" . . . Blah Blah Blahnik. The girls arent interested in anything except shopping drinking and strutting through the desert in slo-mo but whats most appalling is that they vamp to ""I Am Woman"" in this land of sand Nazis. A veil ""cuts back on the Botox bill"" chirps Samantha. Har. In Abu Dhabi husbands can legally beat their wives -- and Carrie thinks this place is Oz a cure for her boredom with a zillionaire husband who she complains eats too much takeout. (She wont cook because shes more ""Coco Chanel than Coq au vin."" Waiter one divorce please). Complications? Carrie loses her passport when distracted by shoes. (Did Lindsay Lohan contribute to this script?) We nearly lose Charlotte when she chases a watch. Native women bond with our heroines -- over shared love for the books of Suzanne Somers. A major problem gets solved in the end when Carrie gets more jewelry. Despite its ""Lawrence of Arabia"" length this film -- the Sexless and the Self-Pitying -- is as unfunny and shapeless as another famed desert epic. Just think of it as ""Bitchtar.""

"Sex and the City 2 The thrill is gone | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSex and the City 2 The thrill is goneThe gals are back and exotic travel and shopping beckon but its hard to shake the hand-me-down feeling of a saga short of ideas emotion and class.From left Cynthia Nixon Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall and Kristin Davis in a scene from Sex and the City 2  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw and John Corbett as Aidan Shaw in a scene from Sex and the City 2.  (Craig Blankenhorn)  Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie Bradshaw in a scene from Sex and the City 2.  (Craig Blankenhorn)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. May 25 2010Sex and the City 2 (out of 4)Starring Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Kristin Davis Cynthia Nixon and Chris Noth. Written and directed by Michael Patrick King. 146 minutes. At major theatres starting Wednesday at 9 p.m. 14AThe Big 3 Ms -- marriage motherhood and menopause -- are very much on the minds of the four fabulous femmes of Sex and the City 2.But its a fourth M -- malaise -- thats a much bigger concern in this over-long and under-performing sequel.Article Continued BelowThe fizz is definitely off the champagne of the continuing saga of New York chums Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) Samantha (Kim Cattrall) Charlotte (Kristin Davis) and Miranda (Cynthia Nixon).Two years ago the novelty of their big-screen reunion in the first Sex and the City feature long after their popular HBO TV series had gone to clearance sales was enough to mask doubts about the frothy screenplay. And writer/director Michael Patrick King was actually working with a real story last time the long-awaited nuptials between Carrie and her commitment-averse beau Mr. Big (Chris Noth).No such luck with SATC 2 where all pretence at storytelling has been replaced with groaning one-liners a time-wasting and patronizing excursion to Abu Dhabi (Morocco in disguise) and bogus conflict between not-so-newlyweds Mr. and Mrs. Big. King and his cast seem content to put everything on autopilot and hope glamour and shopping sprees will be enough to carry them. Nothing much happens -- and it takes 21/2 hours for it not to happen in.Theres certainly plenty of glitter especially in opening scenes at a gay wedding in Connecticut which has been made to look like the old Bing Crosby musical Holiday Inn.An all-male chorus in white tuxedos and Liza Minnelli (or her Madame Tussauds wax double) are on hand for the ceremony as the Fab Four and their man-thingies all crack wise about gay marriage.But all is not Godiva chocolates and silk sheets at the luxury digs of the Bigs where the mister suddenly turns into a couch potato while the missus sulks about being stuck ""somewhere between wild sex and baby"" -- with not much of the former and no chance of the latter. Shes written a new book titled I Do. Do I? that sums up her mixed emotions about the bumpy journey from swinging single to desperate housewife.Carries pals are having their own mid-life traumas. Supermom Charlotte is overwhelmed by caring for two rambunctious young daughters over-achiever Miranda is reliving the 1970s at a law firm where sexism reigns and sex-crazed Samantha has become the poster girl for hormone-replacement therapy and Suzanne Somers self-help books now that menopause has rudely arrived.The action suddenly shifts to Abu Dhabi courtesy of an indulgent sheik who provides gratis first-class airfare and a gigantic hotel suite worthy of royalty (we later finds that it goes for 22000 per night).Here the movie screeches to a grinding halt as the ladies invade the shops and customs of the United Arab Emirates giving Americans a bad name while solicitous men in turbans and shy women in hijabs attend to their every whim. The depiction of Muslims here is perilously close to racist especially when Carrie and the gang bump into a book club of women in swho secretly worship fashion Suzanne Somers and freedom in that order.Its as if the clock has been turned back 60 years or so once again recalling Crosby movies the road pictures he made with Bob Hope. But the Hope/Crosby films had decent songs and jokes to see them through while SATC 2 has only a karaoke version of ""I Am Woman"" (sung while belly-dancers shimmer nearby) and increasingly lewd humor.The character of Samantha is the biggest casualty of SATC 2. Its too much of a good thing her amusingly out-of-control libido becomes the source of jokes that teeter from the banal to the crude making her seem much more of a cartoon character than ever before.But none of the women (or men) come off well in a film where emergency ""inter-friend-tions"" are needed for such faux crises as a forgotten passport a stolen kiss and a buxom nanny. The sex in SATC 2 is mostly all in the mind even for Samantha. While Carrie frets about lusting in her heart over ex-boyfriend Aidan (John Corbett) who miraculously appears Charlotte panics over fears that her busty and braless new Irish nanny -- played by a slumming Alice Eve who deserves better -- will prove too tempting to her husband Harry (Evan Handler).Film franchises usually dont flatline this quickly. This Sex feels more like a tired fourth go than a triumphant second.Fans may not care if theyre content just to see Carrie Samantha Charlotte and Miranda acting up and dressing up.I quote the woman who sat near me at the screening I attended ""My friends are back with me for two hours. What could be wrong?"" But she said that before she saw the movie.

WATCH VIDEO of the premiere below. (Blankenhorn/AP) BY Amy Diluna DAILY NEWS GUEST REVIEWER Monday May 24 2010 1113 PM Title Sex and the City 2 Its been two years since the first ""Sex and the City"" movie - and this shtick is getting old.Though the sequel is a welcome return of the four women we know and love its tough not to acknowledge that if we were all friends in real life at this point wed probably stop taking their calls.The city - long called the franchises ""fifth character"" - takes a backseat this time. NYC is in fact the setting for much discontent Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is fretting that Big (Chris Noth) wants to snuggle on their expensive couch instead of hitting the town.Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has a boss from hell who gives her the hand every time she speaks. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is desperately trying to stave off menopause and Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is going crazy from the sound of her kids squawking though in true form shed never admit it.So they escape to Abu Dhabi (stand-in Morocco) at the invitation of a sheik who wants Samantha to rep his hotel and make it seem attractive to Americans. How could it not be? Its stunning and the girls each get their own Maybach.But like the journey in ""The Wizard of Oz"" (the imagery - from Carries gold-sequined Louboutin pumps to her exclaiming ""Were not in Kansas anymore"" - is vivid) things arent as la-dee-dah as they first seem. Like Champagne left out overnight Samantha Carrie Miranda and Charlotte have lost their sparkle in Sex and the City 2. WATCH VIDEO of the premiere below. (Eshelman/FilmMagic) As if she cant help it Carrie kicks up some trouble for herself after finding Aidan (John Corbett) now a married dad of two in a souk. Shes dressed as Glinda the Good Witch in a poufy skirt and ""Jadore Dior"" T-shirt and she looks like a maniac. But the drama that ensues is so been-there done-that you wonder if she has an emotional imbalance that keeps her perpetually dissatisfied with life.Things fare better for Charlotte and Miranda who bond over motherhood in the way most do - through cocktails.And its not surprising that Samantha eventually creates a culture clash (Oh hadnt you heard? Abu Dhabi doesnt take kindly to public displays of affection.) that leads to one of the dumbest conflict resolutions ever caught on film.The girls have hot bods the clothes and scenery are sublimely sparkly and the zippy zingers fly. A gay wedding and karaoke round out the lady catnip.Its over the top and over the rainbow. But just like Carries worries about the ""sparkle"" leaving her marriage this movie is like once-brilliant Champagne carelessly left out overnight. And gone flat. adilunanydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

ABOUT THE MOVIE Sex and the City 2 1/2 out of fourStars Sarah Jessica Parker Kim Cattrall Kristin Davis Cynthia Nixon Chris Noth John CorbettDirector Michael Patrick KingDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for drug content and language throughout and brief sexual materialRunning time 2 hours 26 minutesOpens at midnight Wednesday in some theaters and Thursday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Fans of the HBO series would be wise to pivot on their Manolo Blahniks and steer clear of the mortifying mess that is Sex and the City 2. An insult to the memory of the cleverly written show and its celebration of friendship its a slap in the face for the four gal pals (often photographed at unflattering angles) and an affront to Muslims. VIDEO Watch the SATC trailer Let us count the ways in which this film offends Crotch-cams awful puns leaden karaoke and suggestive writhing in a Middle Eastern marketplace top the tasteless list. Even more troubling is the movies lampooning of Arabs. With his Cosmopolitan-style approach to all things feminine director Michael Patrick King is out of his league attempting to comment on the inequitable treatment of Muslim women. He ends up mocking religious beliefs and making Carrie and her friends appear insensitive. This new mantle sits more awkwardly than a threadbare boa on their shoulders. The premise has always trafficked in the superficial. But the TV series dipped beneath the surface and interlaced the fashion forays with honest wry discussion about relationships. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) may have had a fairy-tale wardrobe but her love life endured the ups and downs of reality. And the bond among the women felt authentic. Very little in this second movie feels genuine. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) worries about the appeal of her childrens voluptuous Irish nanny (Alice Eve) dubbed ""Erin Go Braless."" Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) has career woes and Samantha (Kim Cattrall) sits in her penthouse office sans drawers. Carrie is more whiny and self-absorbed than her TV version. Wed for two years to her beloved Big (Chris Noth) shes struggling with marital malaise. Her former man-about-town now prefers evenings at home in front of the flat screen. Noth looks pained throughout except when chatting up Penelope Cruz who makes a brief appearance as does Carries former flame Aidan (John Corbett). But theres nothing an all-expenses-paid trip to an exotic locale cant cure. The women descend on Abu Dhabi with more luxe loungewear designer gowns and outlandish hats than ever. Initially they revel in their opulent desert oasis. But things take an ugly turn when lusty Samantha enrages the locals. The movies best scene comes early with a montage of bad 80s fashions and big hair. Then it lunges into the swan-studded over-the-top wedding of Carries gay friend Stanford with the women plastering on forced smiles. The contrived gaiety takes camp to new levels. The sequel offers an oddly retro resolution especially considering the series aspired to be so modern in its treatment of female sexuality. Diamonds are still a girls best friend. Carrie gets rewarded for bad behavior and we get our memories tarnished. Thanks to everyone who has joined in on the conversation below.

Sex and the City 2 Bad Director Michael Patrick King. Cast Sarah Jessica Parker Cynthia Nixon Kim Cattrall Kristin Davis. Rating Rated R for some strong sexual content and language. RELATED Sex and other TV shows that move to the movies Sex appeal Carrie and her gal pals are back Spotlight Sarah Jessica Parker Fashion-forward films Chick flicks Which is the only justification imaginable for ""Sex and the City 2"" a valentine to conspicuous spending that is as banal as it is bloated. Carrie Miranda Charlotte and Samantha are all back in the sequel to the first film which was based on the popular HBO series. But ""Sex and the City 2"" isnt a feature film as much as it is consumer porn. The audience is not asked to relate to the characters or at least what we remember of them as much as to their shoes their bags their apartments their couture their stuff. Yes I am a guy and whats more a guy whose idea of fashion is a pair of Levis and a T-shirt. High fashion? One of those T-shirts without a tag in the back. So maybe ""Sex and the City 2"" will still appeal to the hardcore fans youre thinking. Well I was a fan at least of the first few seasons of the series. But I have my doubts as to how many fans will be left not with writer and director Michael Patrick King turning Carrie into one of the all-time film shrews living the perfect life she dreamed and strived for only to become disillusioned with it when her husband doesnt want to go out to eat every night. Its been two years since Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Big (Chris Noth) finally got married. And despite not one but two gorgeous New York apartments good friends and a husband who clearly loves her Carrie is worried about getting stale. Bigs biggest sin? Buying her a flat-screen TV for their anniversary. Nice? Yeah but she wanted jewelry. Which tells you what you need to know about where shes at. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) is still married to Harry (Evan Handler) and they have two daughters. But motherhood is more difficult than she imagined despite the help of a live-in nanny (whose penchant for not wearing a bra has Charlotte worried). Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and Steve (David Eigenberg) are happy enough but Mirandas miserable at work where a pig of a boss treats her poorly. Samantha (Kim Cattrall) is well still Samantha man-hungry but in a twist doing all she can to stave off menopause a running joke that runs on for pretty much all 146 minutes of the movie. Through a plot development no more ridiculous than any other Samantha lands the girls an all-expense-paid trip to - why not? - Abu Dhabi a place that might teach most people a thing or two about conspicuous consumption. Ah but not our gang who manage to show up in new and fabulous outfits every five minutes Kings camera lingering over every flowing garment or in Samanthas case more often than not lack thereof. Here 6700 miles from home on the company dime they are able to indulge their excesses. Though there are nods to how empowered they are compared to the Arab women around them mostly the Middle East serves as a backdrop for pretty clothes. Honestly by the time they ride camels its ""Ishtar"" in designer gowns. Whats supposed to be going on here is Carrie working out her marital malaise while brushing up against her past Miranda finding purpose Charlotte easing up on the perfect-mom routine Samantha . . . well her issues remain the same with the occasional hot flash thrown in for good measure. Comforting to know that gauche is gauche in any culture I suppose. Whats really going on is an excuse for the women to get dressed up eat shop consume consume consume. Its not as if the original series was shy about Carrie and her friends buying things; Carries shoe tab was legendary. But here the consumption comes first the characters second if that. And what of Carrie? Independence and strength have been pushed aside by a selfishness thats bewildering. Yes many people face the fear of feelings of stagnation. Most dont get the chance to work them out to the tune of 22000 a room per day. Maybe it would be fun to try. Judging from ""Sex and the City 2"" it would have to be more fun than watching someone else do it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Movie review Sex and the City 2 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MarriageMovie review Sex and the City 2Sarah Jessica Parker and Co. return in a needless heedless sequel.May 26 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic If only theyd called it ""Almost No Sex and Very Little City"" at least we would know what we were in for with "" Sex and the City 2."" In this second screen incarnation of the fabulous HBO series the satire is sagging the ironys atrophied and the funny is flabby. Yes the clothes are more fabulous than ever but Carrie Miranda Samantha and Charlotte have misplaced their chic and sassy and become gulp too ordinary and desperate. They were never supposed to be like the rest of us. Still the women are not anywhere as desperate as the movie itself which fails its stars and its many obsessive fans unless everyone was waiting for the AARP version. Writer-director Michael Patrick King whos been behind the wheel since ""Sexs"" first stirrings is clearly driven by love a but baby sometimes love just aint enough. When the girls first went big screen in 2008 the film could be forgiven for being such a dreary dud because it was so good to have the gold-plated four pack back. But theres no free lunch for ""2"" or cosmo for that matter. The opening suggested such promise with a whimsical back-to-the-future reminder of who they were in 86 morphing into where they are 20-plus years later. Charlotte ( Kristin Davis) now a mother of two cries over cupcakes (and by that I mean the Irish nanny whos pinup material as well as the baked goods); Miranda ( Cynthia Nixon) is cowed by her misogynistic boss; Samantha ( Kim Cattrall) suffers a humiliating red carpet run-in with Miley Cyrus whos wearing exactly the same shimmery mini; and Big (Chris Noth) who used to be the deadliest catch two years into marriage to Carrie is content to simply watch ""Deadliest Catch."" Thats left Carrie ( Sarah Jessica Parker) trying to figure out the rules of the 21st century marriage game with Mr. Couch Potato her gay friends and her girlfriends which is not nearly as sexy as the Manhattan singles scene. Or as Samantha might say being married in the Big Apple bites. Naturally its tougher to keep the veneer from cracking with the gal pals settling into their 40s and in Samanthas case very sweaty hot flash 50s. Everything about their lives has become so tame it takes a trip to Abu Dhabi a where canoodling in public is a crime a for any of them to seem outrageous at all. This being a treatise on marriage ""Sex and the City""-style the action starts stateside with a gay wedding extravaganza coupling Carries GBF (Gay Best Friend duh) Stanford (Willie Garson) to Charlottes GBF Anthony (Mario Cantone) until death or a state that doesnt recognize gay marriage do them part. When the question is posed ""Could this wedding get any gayer?"" the filmmakers answer is ""yes Yes YES"" with a Liza Minnelli capper that like the rest of the film sadly shows its age more than its irony. The ostentatious-all-the-time Abu Dhabi trip comes courtesy of a sheik Samantha met and this is where the existential a and menopausal a boundary pushing becomes shark-jumping bait. For Charlotte crisis comes in spotty cellphone coverage; for Samantha its libido issues; for Carrie its temptation in the form of dreamy Aidan (John Corbett) the former beau making her wonder about her Big commitment. Miranda is left scrambling to shore up this sinking ship. Since Abu Dhabi does indeed frown on canoodling much of the film was shot in Morocco. Whether here or there director of photography John Thomas makes the most of the vapid beauty in the desert with no grain of sand out of place and in the blizzard of that white wedding back home. And most importantly the continuous catwalk of designer clothes with ""2"" delivering more costume changes than Scheherazade had stories. King might have done well to borrow from some of those classic Arabian tales. Instead the script is at its weakest when he takes a stab at burka jokes and the lives of the women confined to them. In general the films Muslim sendups fall into two categories painfully clichA(c)d or cringe-worthy. ""Bedouin Bath amp; Beyond"" is bad enough but ""the real housewives of Abu Dhabi""? Really? Ironically the nicest moments a Miranda and Charlotte confessing their parenting woes Big turning into a very believable homebody Aidan talking about his three sons a are the least typical of ""Sex and the City"" fare yet the most in touch with American midlife realities. Cattrall has the toughest go of it with Samantha too sad and too shrill in her menopausal misery a pity. Making the film bearable is Parker who is at her most relaxed in this latest Carrie incarnation. Shes got all the same moves but the emotional ups and downs are modest and the necessary ministrations from her friends barely required. Which begs the question why have a sequel at all? Probably best to leave it to the accountants to answer that one. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com Clicking on Green Links will take you to a third-party e-commerce site.

Guess who wins? _ By David Edelstein Published May 24 2010 ShareThis (Photo Teresa Isasi) Although they sneer at the very notion of religious faith skeptics and atheists have their own martyrshigh among them Hypatia the brilliant beauteous avowedly virginal fourth-century philosopher mathematician astronomer and Carl Sagan pinup girl. In Alejandro Amenabars somber and bloody Agora her big sandals are filled by Rachel Weisz who has eyes so wide apart they seem made to take in the whole of the cosmos and British diction so crisp and forceful that her words could carry far into space. Thats where we first hear her voice in fact. As she mulls over the trajectories of the stars the camera descends from on high way on high above the Earth itself to Alexandria the civilized Egyptian outpost of the teetering Roman Empire and to the stone hall in which Hypatia holds forth while her students (male besotted) drink in her words. Weisz is an excellent Hypatia. For all her intelligence theres something childish off-kilter vaguely otherworldly in her aura. Shes just the type to be gazing into the heavens while around her all hell breaks loose. The title refers to the public space in front of Alexandrias illustrious library although in light of what happens there a better one might be Agoraphobia. The ruling pagan Ptolemies (among them Michael Lonsdale as Hypatias father the head librarian) attack the obstreperous Parabaloni Christians who prove to be greater in numbers and more ferocious than the pagan pointy-heads anticipate. When the blood finally dries the Christian rabble has overrun Alexandria (and the empire) the Ptolemies are kaput the Jews are (again) in exile and the librarythe repository of centuries of Hellenic wisdomhas been turned into a barnyard. Agora doesnt merely exalt the empirical outlook of Hypatia it portrays religious faithall religious faithas monomaniacal superstition a fount of anti-truth. Poor Hypatia is both behind and ahead of the curve. When the hallowed conceit that the cosmos revolves around Earth looks wobbly damned if shell fit the data to the doctrine. Shell get to the bottom (or top) of it even if humans turn out not to be the be-all and end-all. Amenabar who dramatized the schism between flesh and spirit in works as various as The Sea Inside and the ghost story The Others allegedly didnt set out to make a movie that cried A plague on all your houses of worship He and co-writer Mateo Gil stumbled on Hypatia while researching a project about people who in Gils words managed to rise above the circumstances of the moment of history in which they lived by looking up at the stars and wondering who we are where we are and what it all means. Would that we all could be suitable subjects In any case Agora sticks to the arc laid out in Justin Pollard and Howard Reids fast-paced The Rise and Fall of Alexandria. (Pollard was a consultant.) Its true that Hypatia probably spent more time on Neoplatonism than astronomy but Neoplatonism would have been by definition less visual. Hypatia also didnt have a slave-cum-student named Davus (Max Minghella) who was torn between his love for her and his burgeoning Christian faith but Davus makes a good vehicle for dramatizing how even good educated imaginative people can be impelled to get their scriptures in a twist. One of the best moments is when Hypatias onetime student and suitor the prefect Orestes (Oscar Isaac) pushes through a crowd that wants to rip him to shreds yelling hes as much of a Christian as they are. Cyril the bishop who urges his followers to teach Orestes a lesson by visiting their wrath upon his witch and whore is better known as Saint Cyril. Given all the weighty colloquia Agora has remarkably few bad laughs and the CGI re-creations of ancient Alexandria are so detailed I wanted to freeze the frame and linger on the citys layout. I did keep being jarred by the chief loudmouth Christian stone-thrower who looks like Topol in Fiddler on the Roof down to the gap in his front teeth. But maybe the early Christians are meant to look Semiticthey mostly were. Its too bad Muhammad isnt in this thing (he hadnt been born) or fundamentalist Christians Jews and Muslims could bond on the Agora picket line and just for yuks hurl stones at the women waiting to get into Sex and the City 2. The most depressing thing about Sex and the City 2 is that it seems to justify every nasty thing said and written about the series and first feature film. The SATC dynamic has always been fragile but at its most affecting you could see beyond the costumes and artifice and feel the characters fighting for validationand connecting with one another in their struggle. Now theres nothing but surface. And what a surface. 1 2 Next Share this story...
