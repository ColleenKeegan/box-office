""Tin Man"" -- a re-imagined look at the Wizard of Oz -- paid off handsomely for the then-Sci Fi Channel RHI Entertainment and director Nick Willing two years ago. Those parties have thus reunited on ""Alice"" another lavish two-parter -- this time derived from ""Alice in Wonderland"" -- with plenty of big-name cameos and equally uneven results. Willing has reshaped Wonderland into a kind of swinging psychedelic 60s but its all set design in search of a purpose. Despite a few surreal kicks this headlong trip through the looking glass brews a rather weak tea party. A grown woman and (conveniently) martial-arts instructor poor Alice (Caterina Scorsone) finally brings a guy home to meet her mother only to have her new beau Jack (""Crusoes"" Philip Winchester) present her a gaudy ring before rather abruptly heading for the exit. Following him she tumbles through a mirror and is whisked into the strange world of Wonderland where the Queen of Hearts (Kathy Bates doubtless drawn to the role for its fabulous frocks) rules with an iron fist. Like ""Tin Man"" ""Alice"" recasts this familiar place and its characters with a darker tint with the confused heroine and her newfound pals -- including a resistance fighter named Hatter (""Primevals"" Andrew Lee Potts) and the addled White Knight (Matt Frewer) -- rebelling against a totalitarian state. Here Willing has also incorporated exploitation of fellow residents from Alices world who are lured to Wonderland and turned into unthinking zombies held captive in casinos and derisively called ""Oysters."" Jacks ring meanwhile is an object of great importance (where have we heard that before?) -- one that the Queen desperately covets. Mostly its an excuse for lots of chases and fighting with the occasional CGI monster thrown in for good measure. The real star however is the kitschy sensibility which falls somewhere between the 1960s version of ""Casino Royale"" and the Austin Powers movies -- including trippy artifacts like flying Pink Flamingos. The opening night closes with the best sequence in the entire production as a captured Alice is subjected to psychological torture by Doctors Dee and Dum (a very creepy Eugene Lipinski). After that though the narrative devolves into a series of unimpressive action sequences augmented by a thin romantic triangle involving Alice Hatter and Jack. As for the aforementioned marquee players most appear fleetingly with Harry Dean Stanton turning up in night two as Caterpillar and channeling the late Hunter S. Thompson. Its obvious theyre on hand mostly to impress international buyers though one would think that trick would eventually yield diminishing returns. Although Syfy scored with ""Tin Man"" its difficult to imagine this Lewis Carroll-inspired lark (hopefully to be confused presumably with Disneys upcoming movie) possessing quite the same appeal. Laying down big bets on fantasy properties remains admirable in theory but unless many Oysters crave another multinight disappointment on the heels of AMCs ""The Prisoner"" Syfy should discover all that glitters is not ""Tin.""

"amyweekly >> Blog Archive >> Alice in Wonderland amyweekly Amy Nicholsons reviews and interviews << The Ghost Writer Remember Me >> Alice in Wonderland ""Curiouser and curiouser"" says Alice (Mia Wasikowska) in Tim Burtons latest and for the first time I dont believe her. Wonderland is still wild even though in the 13 years since her last visit swaths of it have been napalmed by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) avenging herself on her prettier sister the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). But Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton have added a twist that they cant seem to settle. This teen beauty Alice doesnt remember her first adventure but has dreamt of the land down under since she was a girl--huge black circles under her eyes testify. So when she bolts during a high-pressure marriage proposal from a rich snot and follows a rabbit wearing a waistcoat (just like the one in her dream) down a hole and in front of a blue caterpillar and dodo bird (just like the ones in her dream) she thinks that somehow shes slipped asleep. But heres the issue to her Wonderland is neither a mind-blowing new world nor the old homestead she visits every night. Shes not amazed to meet the Mad Hatter nor does she try to pick up yesterdays somnolent conversation. Either would do. What wont do is this muddle. This isnt about picking apart Burtons space-time continuum. This is about wonder itself. Fantasy films need a main character who acts as our guide; through them we feel wowed cowed lost and brave. Plop in a dull lead and were walled off from feeling anything. This isnt Wasikowskas fault--shes lovely and game--but a shocking lack of inspiration from Burton who simply refashions Lewis Carroll into The Wizard of Oz. Smart head-scrambling nonsense? Nah just give us two battling witch-queens who make a teen girl settle their war. Burton dropped his creative genius somewhere in Sleepy Hollow and like a restless madman in the Hollywood asylum has spent the last 10 years obsessively drawing crooked trees. Burtons best films--Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands--have been the ones where he helped brainstorm the story. And both were set in the present-day mundane farms and suburbs that showcased their big emotions and imagination. This last decade hes wasted his efforts on picking stories he seems to see as shortcuts Planet of the Apes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Alice that come complete with their loony worlds. All Burton has to do is add crooked trees. And thats all he does. Of course his foliage is a package deal that includes starring roles for Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter who always give Burton their all. But with Depp Burton has to know what to ask brains or Wonka? (He goes full Wonka.) Here Depp feels completely set adrift veering from revolutionary hero to dance machine. Bonham Carter however seems to be the only actor on set who thinks for herself and her Queen of Hearts is wicked fun. Shes a hydrocephalic mean girl fighting insecurity--when shes feeling weak someones gonna lose their head. Crispin Glover as her Knave is a great stroke of casting. Hathaways White Queen doesnt get a punchline but there are hints shes every bit as creepy as her sister. Nearly every second of Alice feels boggy and preordained. Were never in doubt that Alice will do whatever she has to do--which is for this dull Alice whatever everyone else in Wonderland prophecies she must. Were looking for something anything that totally goes off the rails and the only moment that does is when the Hatter hits on Alice. Were jolted awake in alarm (flashbacks of him tea-partying it up with the child dont help). On Friday Burton will make many kids first introduction to Alice and her Wonderland--a tragedy. In the spirit of Carroll Im all for adventure but this weekend Id rather they stay locked up at home.

Helena Bonham Carter is shown in a scene from the Alice in Wonderland. Photo Disney Alice in Wonderland 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Alicein Wonderland? Is that what it is? Because it doesnt look like any Alice I know. It has action scenes. Traumatic flashbacks. Heartfelt bonding between Alice and the Mad Hatter whose gimongous green eyes swell with emotion. Theres even a scene where Alice gets hit on by the Knave of Hearts one of the skeevier conceits in this fumbled Disney update. But its single biggest failing -- an affront to Lewis Carroll and the charms of nonsense literature -- is the fact that it makes sense. Director Tim Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton have labored hard to shoehorn the arch asymmetrical balderdash of the original works (both Alices Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass) into a 3-D CG-enhanced extravaganza of boring and time-worn fantasy conventions. It isnt often a 3-D movie almost puts me to sleep. All the usual suspects are there the Hatter (Johnny Depp lisping and looking like Edward Scissorhands deranged-clown brother); the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter her forehead ballooned digitally); the Knave (Crispin Glover); the Cheshire Cat (the voice of Stephen Fry); the White Queen (a bleached Anne Hathaway); the Hookah-Smoking Caterpillar (the voice of Alan Rickman); and the bustling White Rabbit (the voice of Michael Sheen). As ever Alice shrinks and expands by sampling the local fare. As ever her response is ""curiouser and curiouser"" muttered in a dazed aside. The world shes entered is much less curious on the whole. In Burtons ""extension"" set 13 years after her last adventure Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is now a young woman. But she doesnt just fall through a rabbit hole into an identity-warping pun-obsessive underworld. She must embark instead on a standard chivalrous quest rescuing compatriots fending off evil and affirming her own grrrl-powered identity in the process. As the stoned larva helpfully explains a girl named Alice is prophesied to slay the the Jabberwocky on the fateful Frabjous Day deposing the wicked Red Queen and returning the crown to her pale sister. Those playful words are lifted from the poem Jabberwocky -- which pops up in Looking-Glass and describes in a manner of speaking the creatures defeat at the hands of a valiant boy. But its principal aim is aimlessness a nonsensical play on poetic structure. The idea of using it as the basis for cliche filmmaking is a crime against Carroll. Visually theres fun to be had. Landscapes are Burtonesque fingered branches scratching an ashen moonlit sky. Every other figure is elongated or exaggerated the pingpong eyes of the Hatter the stretched-out bod of the Knave. The scenes with the mondo-headed Red Queen are fabulous in a sick way as a hissy-fitting Bonham Carter warps her Rs (""It is my cwown"") and barks out the movies best line (""Anyone with hair that large is welcome in my court"" she says of Alice). Burton can do what he likes of course; the classics generally survive even the lamest adaptations. Yet the title suggests a film that simply isnt. Better Alice in Burtonland Alice in Disneyland or maybe Alice in Narnia which would own up to an obvious debt. ""Im sorry"" says the lass herself ""I dont mean to be the wrong Alice.""

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 05 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Alice in Wonderland Directed by Tim Burton Written by Linda Woolverton Starring Mia Wasikowska Johnny Depp Helena Bonham-Carter Classification PG It does get curiouser and curiouser. Despite all the computer-generated wizardry and the 3-D gadgetry and Tim Burton flashing his directorial magic and Johnny Depp acting mad as a hatter the most transfixing part of Alice in Wonderland is Alice - more specifically Alices very human face such an old soul of a young face almost beautiful rather grave wide-eyed and insistent on owning the bittersweet fruits of her lively imagination. ""This is my dream"" she cries out more than once - and indeed it is. The face belongs to Mia Wasikowska. The fortunate may remember her from the HBO series In Treatment where portraying a troubled teenager she burned a hole right through the small screen - one look was enough to know you were in the presence of a major talent. Here thanks to Linda Woolvertons reworking of the Lewis Carroll books Wasikowska is a teen again. This is an older Alice 19 now poised to return to the half-remembered ""Underland"" of her youth although not before appearing as the star attraction at a Victorian engagement party. There proposed to by dishwater-dull Hamish she does the only sane thing - flees down the rabbit hole with her furry frocked companion. The familiar journey begins. And the familiar figures dutifully make their appearance. Of course before they do Alice feeds her head in Wonderlands barren anteroom - a sip makes her small a morsel grows her tall - and here Burton does a superb job playing with the perspective. Its a simple yet beguiling scene. Everything that follows is a lot more complicated but not quite as beguiling. Although each individual component is fine - the Cheshire Cat grins his floating grin the Jabberwocky jabbers up a dark storm the Tweedles do their dumming and deeing - the addition feels slightly off and in the end the overall picture seems less than the sum of its parts. So yes it is curious to enjoy these parts separately while still experiencing a collective letdown. For example Depps Mad Hatter is fun with his clothes like a mood-ring changing colours to match his mercurial temper and with Depp switching accents accordingly - here a gap-toothed English lisp there a thick Scottish burr. Amusing too is Helena Bonham Carters evil Red Queen all bulbous-headed and acid-tongued and so salaciously delicious when she coos over those humpty-dumpty Tweedles ""I looove my fat boys."" Balancing her on the moral scales is the sisterly White Queen but Anne Hathaway makes sure we can detect a sibling resemblance playing her with a regal air that borders on the haughty. Thats nicely in keeping with Carrolls topsy-turvy world where nothing not even goodness is quite what it seems. Less faithful is the effort to tilt the narrative toward an action climax which only serves to make Wonderlands oddities look more conventional even anticlimactic. A bit of tedium sets in at this point not least with the vaunted 3-D enhancements that have stopped enhancing and started distracting. Burton himself appears bored with this tool in his box content to resort to that tired in-your-face gimmickry - hey duck that pointy stick dodge that flapping butterfly. Instead the true three-dimensionality here is the old-fashioned kind - Wasikowskas fully rounded performance. Throughout the technical razzle-dazzle we keep returning to the pallor of that face the gravity in those eyes. Shes the ballast in all this free-floating imagination giving the picture weight and ambiguity too - the near-woman in retreat from the impending world of Hamishes back to childhoods fragile fancies. I wish the scripts last frames had taken advantage of that ambiguity but they dont tacking on a resolution that unwisely brightens up Wasikowskas darker and delicate shadings. No matter. This is still her picture. Shes its 10-foot tower mysterious and brave and excited and withdrawn. Alice is the true magic in a Wonderland thats mere movie magic - the happy surprise amidst everything weve come to expect.

Staggering sometimes disconcerting and occasionally truly magical. (The butterfly at the end of the film seems to float into the theater.) Burton and Disney have found a glorious way to interpret fairy tales and fantasies. This time Wonderland has only a nodding acquaintance with Disneys cuddlier 1951 animated version. The movie opens with Alice (Mia Wasikowska) teetering on the edge of adulthood at age 19. Shes grown up (without the help of Upelkuchen cake) but is still self-possessed and a bit contradictory. Except for occasional flashbacks to a younger Alice (including one scene in which Alice bears an unnerving resemblance to the murdered child-pageant star JonBenet Ramsey) the story remains with the post-pubescent Alice enlivening her association with the Mad Hatter. Initially Alice and her mother are en route to a social gathering that turns out to Alices dismay to be a surreptitious engagement party. When the chinless prissy groom- to-be proposes Alice excuses herself ostensibly to reflect on his offer but really to chase the intriguing white rabbit that lures her into Underland. And from here the tales touchstones -- the bottle labeled ""Drink Me"" the intangible Cheshire Cat the terrifying Red Queen and her bulbous head the terrible Jabberwocky -- serve as tenuous anchors for the runaway story. This must be what its like in the wake of an earthquake or fire a landscape thats familiar but not really. We know Alice will shrink when she sips from the ""Drink Me"" bottle but the transformation is still shocking. We know shell grow after nibbling the ""Eat Me"" cake but her enormity is monstrous. Its at once an extraordinarily faithful and tremendously imaginative version of illustrator Arthur Rackhams definitive ""Alice"" drawings. We know Alice will meet up with the Mad Hatter but Johnny Depps weird Goth/P.T. Barnum take on the character comes out of left field. Those preternatural eyes So disturbingly green so subtly outsized (They were altered 10 to 15 percent larger in post-production computer- generated imagery.) Even more astonishing is the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) with her exquisite tiny body and her comical horrifying spheroid head. Each word that escapes her unlovable heart-shaped lips falls like a curse. She would cow Severus Snape. Which brings up an important point This ""Alice in Wonderland"" is aimed solidly at viewers old enough to see one of the ""Harry Potter"" movies without leaving the lights on all night afterward. It may be rated PG but think twice before taking children under age 10 to a screening. Children too young for ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" two other landmark Burton films definitely are too young to see ""Alice."" This is a dark movie -- comic moments but still more bleak than blithe. The Bandersnatch a fearsome combination of badger hyena and Komodo dragon and the Jabberwocky which looks like a relative of the creatures in the ""Alien"" movies are nightmare-inducing. The tension feels quite real and the 3-D technology underscores that sensibility. Expect to duck a couple of times when flying debris seems to hurtle from the screen into the movie theater. ""ALICE IN WONDERLAND.""PG for fantasy action/violence involving scary images and situations and for a smoking caterpillar. 1 hour 48 minutes. Directed by Tim Burton. Screenplay by Linda Woolverton based on the books ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking-Glass"" by Lewis Carroll.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 4 2010 Save for later Saved Actor Johnny Depp is shown as The Mad Hatter in a scene from the film ""Alice in Wonderland."" Disney/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The betting line on the new Disney 3-D ""Alice in Wonderland"" was that it would be marvelous because the imaginings of its director Tim Burton are pronouncedly in sync with Lewis Carrolls. But are they really? The movie is a decidedly mixed bag in part because of the equally pronounced disparities between Burton and Carroll - and between Burton and Disney for that matter.When Burton made ""Sweeney Todd"" he transformed Stephen Sondheims elegant blood sport into a charnel house. In ""Alice in Wonderland"" Carrolls maniacally witty and disturbing phantasmagoria inspires a lot of sinister Tim Burton-isms. The problem is most of the Burton-isms are half-baked.I wouldnt have minded if Burton used Carroll as the merest of jumping-off points for his own nightmarish visions. What we have instead is a hybrid Carrolls hallucinatory wit crossed with Burtons rank unseemliness rolled into Disney ""wholesomeness."" (The script is by Linda Woolverton who is credited on ""The Lion King"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Mulan."") In the end ""Alice in Wonderland"" doesnt work either as visionary entertainment or as plain old family entertainment. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? IN PICTURES Academy Award for Best Picture nominees Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gallery Academy Award for Best Picture nominees 2010 Alice in Wonderland movie review Burton has lifted ample amounts from both ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass"" but crucially he sets the story for the most part 13 years ahead of the material in the books so that Alice (Mia Wasikowska) instead of being a preteen is 19. Alices journey via rabbit hole into Wonderland (called Underland here) represents her second not first such descent. And her escape is mundanely motivated She cuts out on an arranged marriage to an upper-crust twit.Wasikowski has a Pre-Raphaelite Goldilocks look thats shimmeringly fine and she gives Alice some much-needed backbone too. Her ballast grounds her in the Underland where the film becomes heavily computer-generated and expands into full-blown 3-D (though the above ground scenes are uninterestingly in 3-D too). Alice holds her own with Absolem the Blue Caterpillar (voiced with world-weary aplomb by Alan Rickman); Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas); the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry); the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen); and the hunting dog Bayard (Timothy Spall). She even stands up to the Red Queen portrayed triumphantly by Helena Bonham Carter as a yowling oversized head atop a pint-sized body. (As for Anne Hathaways White Queen the less said the better - shes so pallid that her head might have been dunked in a sack of flour.).The big draw here of course is Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and contrary to expectations he underplays the role. His Hatter may have a clownish orange aureole of hair and a pasty face ringed with raccoonish eye shadow but hes first and foremost a gentleman. Even though I initially wished for a more hypercharged performance from Depp I appreciated his delicacy and charm. He knows when to chew the scenery and when to go on a diet.At times Burton seems to be channeling ""The Wizard of Oz"" as much as Lewis Carroll and the familiarity is more confusing than enchanting. Other times especially at the end when the film devolves into a generic action fantasy it summons up ""The Lord of the Rings."" I kept expecting Frodo to intervene. Not a good sign.Burton originally shot ""Alice in Wonderland"" in 2-D and then converted it to 3-D. One might have thought that Burton who is also a gifted artist would go hog wild exploring the possibilities of 3-D rather than retrofitting his movie to cash in on the current craze. As with so much else in this movie hes pulling his punches. No knockouts here. No tkos either.

But purists beware Burton and his writer Disney regularLinda Woolverton (The Lion King) invent a quest narrative - Alice must slay the Jabberwocky - that climaxes in a pedestrian battle for which Alice puts aside dresses and channels Joan of Arc. Moreover our heroines loopy headtrip begins with her fleeing a very public marriage proposal with the twenty-first-century excuse I need a moment... This is a loose enjoyable and safe spin on the books with familiar characters doing familiar things within the altered - and digitised - framework of an older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returning underground to find the Red Queen (a fun Helena Bonham Carter actually playing a conflation of the Red Queen and the Queen of Hearts) ruling a depressed land. The problem with this downtrodden version of Wonderland is that it doesnt always sit well with the mania of Carrolls creations and when we see a brighter flashback of the Red Queen painting roses we wish we were in that world. Imagine the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry) the wise Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) and the Mad Hatter (an underwhelming repetitive Johnny Depp) all doing their thing in the forests of Avatars Pandora after a long bout of acid rain and you begin to get the picture. Much of the colour has been sucked out and replaced with dark skies and long faces. Yet much of Carrolls magical nonsense remains even if Burtons film wobbles at the gates of anarchy and ends up being a more average affair than many might expect. Its also one in which the inventive costumes and individual flights of animated fancy end up being more memorable than the thin characters and half-hearted  3D rendering. As its Burton at the helm you could call it gothic. The less generous might just call it gloomy.

Depp is fine does his job well. Helena Bonham Carter is her usual quirky self and the cheshire Cat caterpillar and Tweedle Dum and Dee are interesting if slightly glossed over characters. I have no problems with the story being changed as innovation is key to the progression of cinema. The fact the the storyline didnt make sense i thought was rather keeping with the idea of madness and eccentricity and dint really matter too much. the main issue was the lack of any character in Alice. her performance was somewhat boring and didnt really add anything to the picture. which is a shame as there is a lot of young talent out there. overall not a bad film but nowhere near as engaging as ""Up"" or ""Avatar"" in terms of family entertainment.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 14 2010KerryFeaturedDepp wasas usual wonderful whacky amp; totally believable as a mad mad hatter.

I enjoyed the film and found Johnny Depp as watchable as ever but left the cinema feeling a little 2D (ironic I know). The film is good in parts without ever reaching a real sense of climax the performances from all the main characters is as strong as you would expect but there was just something missing for me. Perhaps it was because I didnt really find Alice particularly engaging as a character.

In this respect I was not disappointed. Too much attention was paid to the look of the film ; yes I know that is a Burton trademark but it shouldnt put paid to attention in other ares such as decent plot character development casting and acting. I am so sick of the same old perfromances being doled out by the same old actors in the same old Burton films.

Alice in Wonderland Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland (Disney) represents the confluence of a number of depressing cinematic trends the need to ransack classic childrens literature for ideas the unimaginative layering of 3-D technology onto a visual universe that would look just fine without it and the belief that slathering familiar storylines with a superficial gloss of Gothic ""darkness"" constitutes a substantial reinterpretation. Lewis Carrolls eminently sensible British schoolchild has been taken on a shopping spree at Hot Topic (an experience that viewers are invited to share by donning the line of tie-in merchandise available for purchase at that teen-Goth chain) and the resulting makeover doesnt do her any favors. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. I guess its too much to have hoped that Burton would do justice to the language of Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass to Carrolls intricate logic puzzles and plays on the literal and figurative meaning of words. A film adaptation should of course treat its source material as inspiration rather than dogma. But did Burton have to get the books so entirely wrong? An Alice filtered through the lens of young-adult fantasy fiction complete with villains in eye patches post-traumatic stress flashbacks and CGI dragons in need of Joseph Campbell-style slaying ceases to be Alice at all. Advertisement Burtons Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is 19 years old a freethinking young woman about to be betrothed to a dull aristocratic prig. Since childhood shes been haunted by recurring dreams of a fall down a rabbit hole and conversations with a hookah-smoking caterpillar. (Though we initially approach him through wreaths of curling smoke Im not sure we ever actually see the caterpillar voiced by Alan Rickman inhaling--perhaps for fear of unwholesome influence.) At her engagement party Alice escapes her importuning suitor to follow a white rabbit and soon finds herself falling down just such a hole giving Burton plenty of chances to test out the 3-D button on his dashboard. The scene that takes place immediately after she lands--the glass table the hall of locked doors the ""Drink Me"" bottle and ""Eat Me"" cake--may be the movies best moment one in which Burton makes clever use of computer animation to create vertiginous effects of scale as Alice shrinks and grows. This scene also employs a limited color palette and stark backgrounds that evoke the books spooky original illustrations by John Tenniel. But as soon as Alice unlocks one of those doors and enters into Wonderland proper (which according to a poorly explained aside late in the film is known to its residents as ""Underland"") the CG effects start coming so thick and fast that neither she nor we have time to experience much wonder at all. Look there go Tweedledum and Tweedledee (voiced by Matt Lucas)--but before weve had a chance to witness their unique sibling dynamic at work or hear a single line of ""The Walrus and the Carpenter"" (the recitation of which was one of the high points of the 1951 Disney version) Alice and the egg-shaped twins are being chased through the animated underbrush by some sort of giant saber-toothed beast as Danny Elfmans score throbs and swoops. The feeling in this movie is always that of being frantically rushed to the next thing the Mad Hatters tea party hasnt even gotten truly barmy before its broken up by invading soldiers led by the menacing Knave of Hearts (a digitally stretched-out Crispin Glover). About that Mad Hatter Hes played by Johnny Depp in tragic-demented Willy Wonka mode and hes been elevated from the vaguely hostile tea-party guest of the book into a sympathetic lead character whos almost a romantic partner for Alice. This isnt a doomed story choice in and of itself but for all the screen time devoted to the Hatter we never grasp his motivation--what about him is ""mad"" besides his Bozo coiffure and white Clockwork Orange-style eyepaint? Why does he love Alice and why does she return that love? Burton is the one who decided to give these characters pat psychological backstories--Alice must slay the fearsome Jabberwock in order to slay her inner demons--so its up to him to come through with reasons why we should care. Burtons real-life partner Helena Bonham Carter is visually and vocally perfect for the role of the Queen of Hearts her giant heart-shaped face perched atop a tiny animated body. But for all the work thats gone into devising the characters Valentine-lollipop look and querulous voice shes never given anything memorable to say beyond ""Off with her head"" Stephen Fry (as the Cheshire Cat) Timothy Spall (as the Queen of Hearts pet bloodhound) and Michael Sheen (as the White Rabbit) all provide top-drawer voice work but the sense of ensemble is absent. Just as the human actors seem to have been filmed in green-screen isolation so the voices sound like theyve arrived from separate glassed-in booths. (Compare for example Fantastic Mr. Fox in which the actors mesh so beautifully with one another and with their animated avatars that you forget George Clooney and Meryl Streep werent born covered in fur.) Advertisement Thanks to the Burton-Depp-Elfman brand and to Disneys unrelenting marketing campaign (a favor Burton returns in the movie making both the Red and White Queens castles look like mockups of the iconic Disney one) this Alice in Wonderland will likely pull huge audiences down its rabbit hole. As the Hollywood Reporter dryly puts it ""Disney wont have to consume any little cakes in glass boxes in order for the ... worldwide box office to reach colossal heights."" For audiences to enjoy this movie however they might have to smuggle in a batch of special brownies.

Every scene brings something new and remarkable--if not quite wonderful--to look at yet every scene sweeps away specific recollections of the previous one. Looked at through one lens thats a tribute to the immediacy of the images as well as the wizardly integration of live and computer-generated action. Looked at through another though its a signal that Mr. Burton and his colleagues like so many filmmakers before them were flummoxed by the Lewis Carroll conundrum--not the one about why a raven is like a writing desk but why that peerless authors enchanting prose should be so resistant to dramatization. Watch a clip from Tim Burtons take on ""Alice in Wonderland"" starring Johnny Depp Mia Wasikowska Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway. Video courtesy of Walt Disney. To be fair about Disneys latest attempt to chronicle Alices trips down the rabbit hole and through the looking glass--the studios 1951 animated version still has its passionate partisans and detractors--drama isnt what the target audience will be coming for. Both Mr. Burton and Disney are global brands--better-known brands than Lewis Carroll these days--and the merchandise theyve manufactured fulfills two sets of expectations. Its more gothic than Victorian and slightly tinctured with danger but fully equipped with the sort of exuberant action that sits well in movie theaters and better still in the great theme-park hereafter. The heroine is played with sweet verve by the Australian actress Mia Wasikowska. This Alice at the ripe young age of 19 is returning to the magical world of her childhood so she knows its all a dream. Still Linda Woolvertons screenplay makes it clear that shes much less sophisticated than she thinks. Dream or not Alice is caught up in a power struggle that is raging between the forces of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and the poor girls most reliable guide is the Mad Hatter who is played by Johnny Depp. As you might expect--as his fans surely expect--Mr. Depps mincing flouncing Mad Hatter bears more than a passing resemblance to Jack Sparrow though Hatters faint lisp and gap-toothed grin also suggest Laurence Oliviers Archie Rice in ""The Entertainer"" or a young Boris Karloff doing Humphrey Bogart. Hes very funny in mildly funny surroundings that are peopled--creatured--by such bizarre creations as the doughnut-necked beetle-browed and shaved-headed Tweedledum and Tweedledee. (I did like the Blue Caterpillar intimately voiced by Alan Rickman.) But theres nothing mild about Ms. Bonham Carters Red Queen. Shes quick and fierce with Cupids-bow lips a Bette Davis forehead and a huge cranium atop a tiny body. She gets a big laugh every time she howls ""Off with her head"" and she stops the show every time shes on screen. ENLARGE Helena Bonham Carter above at right is the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland. Disney Related Speakeasy Alice in Wonderland Review Revue Speakeasy Selling Alice in Wonderland One Eyeshadow at a Time Disney Invites Goths to the Party Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter in Sweeney Todd How she does it says a lot about the actors craft and helps to clarify what the movie is missing. Ms. Bonham Carters star turn in a secondary role is exquisite for its precision and economy. In writing about her performance as the pie maker Mrs. Lovett in Mr. Burtons ""Sweeney Todd"" I admired her song-and-dance-womans sense of timing and thats vividly in evidence once again. When the Red Queen says ""I need a pig here"" its a regal request for a footrest issued casually; she is clearly accustomed to comforting her feet with warm pork bellies. Mr. Depp can be a phenomenal performer too but not this time. Like the production as a whole his Mad Hatter is an agreeably whimsical yet unsurprising assemblage while Ms. Bonham Carters absolute monarch is a force of unnature and a triumphant illogician. The most surprising thing about ""Alice in Wonderland"" is its general lack of surprise. Was Mr. Burton so distracted by the demands of the complex effects that he had to settle for conventionality? Its not an unreasonable assumption; distraction has become endemic to such productions which need the services of a field marshal rather than a director. Whatever the cause or causes the results are showy but patchy and initially pokey. A leisurely preface shows Alice not only as a child dreaming her Wonderland dreams but as a bride-to-be faced with the prospect of imprisonment in a ghastly marriage. (If that sections bleached almost colorless look was meant to be a comment on the bloodless society of Alices upbringing it was an unattractive and uninviting idea.) As the White Queen Ms. Hathaway has little to do but look pretty which she does and vaguely abstracted like a woman wandering around a beauty parlor while she waits for her nails to dry. A succession of chases and fanciful combats more akin to Dungeons amp; Dragons than to Carroll leads to a peculiarly truncated climax. The 3-D effects are enjoyable but the added depth cant make up for deficits in the concept or the plot. At bottom the concept is earnest bordering on commonplace a coming-of-age story in which Alice takes therapeutic refuge in her fantasies and emerges from them a stronger person. As for the plot or lack of it the filmmakers can be blamed only up to a point. They havent solved the Lewis Carroll conundrum havent cracked the structural code because Carrolls discursive masterworks dont have much structure and can be dramatized only up to a point even though their imagery is endlessly tantalizing. The unseizable essence of the two books isnt pictures at all the Tenniel illustrations notwithstanding. Its the scintillating interplay of language and logic satiric wit and sublime silliness. For those who have tried to capture the books on screen and for those who will try in the future its a case of read em and weep. Brooklyns Finest ENLARGE From left Richard Gere and Ethan Hawke as police officers in Brooklyns Finest. Overture Films ""Just keep everybody calm"" Richard Geres soul-sick veteran cop tells the rookie hes been assigned to work with in ""Brooklyns Finest."" Its an echo of ""Training Day"" Antoine Fuquas strong 2001 thriller with Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. But no one is calm in Mr. Fuquas new film which co-stars Mr. Hawke as one of three Brooklyn cops in desperate straits. (The third is played by Don Cheadle.) The directors governing principle must have been to keep everybody agitated overwrought and profanely prolix while the rookie writer Michael C. Martin kept everything derivative Scorsese Tarantino Richard Price ""The Departed"" ""The Wire"" you name it and he imitated it. Whatever one may think of the overall style--I think its ludicrous--Mr. Fuqua clearly wanted his film to be operatic and so it is in a tone-deaf way. It is also alas interlocking in a way that slavishly emulates ""Crash"" (which staked its own claim to absurdity). I wont belabor the specifics of the story except to say that Mr. Hawkes desperate cop Sal needs money for a new house because his wife is pregnant with twins and the house theyre living in has suddenly come down with a case of wood mold. In that sense if no other ""Brooklyns Finest"" is a cautionary tale. Mold is deadly. It can even infect movies. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD Focus ENLARGE Spirited Away (2001) Hayao Miyazakis animated masterpiece distributed in the U.S. by Disney could also be described as a coming-of-age story in which a girl takes refuge in her fantasies and emerges from them a stronger person. But what breathtaking fantasies they are and what mysteries they contain. The 10-year-old heroine Chihiro finds herself alone after her parents make memorable pigs of themselves at an abandoned restaurant and forges a new life for herself in a glittering steaming hot-springs resort where spirits of every shape disposition and composition--good and evil opaque and transparent--come to refresh themselves. ENLARGE Chocolat (2000) Johnny Depp is Roux a handsome young rogue with what seems to be an Irish accent in this big-hearted petit-pois-brained exercise in retro-Gallic nostalgia. Juliette Binoche is Vianne a beautiful and mysterious woman who opens a store that sells magical chocolate candies--Viagra-cum-saturated fat. Though the setting is supposedly 1960s France the story really takes place in a timeless picturesque village--Brigadoon-cum-Deux Chevaux--populated with every cultural stereotype that France has ever inflicted on a gullible world (and to be fair on itself.) The cast includes Alfred Molina. Lasse Hallstrom directed. ENLARGE Hamlet (2000) Michael Almereydas daring update gives us the Danish prince played by Ethan Hawke as a film school student who has not only lost all his mirth but his grip on objective reality. This perpetual postadolescent watches movies on a mini-VCR as he slouches around midtown Manhattan in a knitted hat and a purple funk. Sure the movies a stunt but one that succeeds much more often than it stumbles. Julia Stiles plays Ophelia with mixed results though her mad scene staged on the helical ramp of the Guggenheim Museum is exquisite as well as slightly mad in its own right. --Joe Morgenstern Find related television listings at LocateTV.

"Alice in Wonderland Simply frabjous | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAlice in Wonderland Simply frabjousThe curiouser and curiouser thing about Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland is how he actually manages to find new wonderment in this oft-told tale.Helena Bonham Carter stars in Alice in Wonderland.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. March 4 2010Alice in Wonderland The curiouser and curiouser thing about Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland is how he actually manages to find new wonderment in this oft-told tale.So familiar are the rabbit-chasing antics of Lewis Carrolls 1865 dream fantasy and so often has the story been brought to screens large and small any new rendering seems more a matter of accountancy than discovery Mad Hatter check. Cheshire Cat check. Tweedledum and Tweedledee check...Working with Disney scribe Linda Woolverton (co-writer of Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King) Burton assigns order and drama to Carrolls creation which suffers from lack of momentum in its traditional telling. (As per the norm they have combined the creatures and story elements from Alice in Wonderland and its 1872 sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass.)The narrative now has a real arc complete with prologue and epilogue that gives meaning to Alices adventures and also gives her a greater hand in her own destiny.Article Continued BelowNewcomer Mia Wasikowska who resembles a young Mia Farrow or Gwyneth Paltrow nimbly enlivens the role of Alice balancing innocence with bravery and intelligence.Her character has been made slightly older age 19 to fit the prologues clever reimagining of Alice as a headstrong young woman one still capable of childlike dreams who embarks on a rabbit-hole adventure after refusing to accept a marriage of convenience to a wealthy fop.No longer does Alice just dumbly react to events as is so often the case in past tellings; now shes integral to the action and the storys resolution -- which true to Burtons instincts includes elements of mystery and gothic horror.Theres some question as to whether shes the real Alice since she doesnt look like the one who previously visited Wonderland.And she has returned to the place following that clock-watching rabbit of yore at a time when it is under the dark shadow of despotic rule the hideous Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) bested the fair White Queen (Anne Hathaway) in a ruinous battle that removed all ""frabjous joy"" from the land.With the backing of her eye-patched Svengali the Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover) and a fearsome menagerie of creatures and playing-card soldiers the Red Queen maintains order by the constant threat of ""Off with their heads"" The moat outside her castle is filled with severed noggins.The Mad Hatter plays a much larger role in Burtons production which is to be expected since hes assigned to Johnny Depp Burtons grandest muse. But fears based upon the trailer that the story would front-and-centre the Hatter while shoving Alice into the background prove unfounded.Depps Hatter is more of a catalyst to action and a commenter upon it than he is a major definer of it -- which is not to say that Depp doesnt bring some genuine kooky charm to the role. With his gap-toothed smile circus attire and digitally enlarged eyeballs hes almost unrecognizable but still entirely delightful.Less prominent but offering welcome new shadings to familiar creations are Stephen Frys inscrutable Cheshire Cat Michael Sheens irritable White Rabbit and Alan Rickmans insouciant Blue Caterpillar.Some may quibble at the liberties taken include ing terrifying subplot about a dragon that needs slaying expanded from Carrolls whimsy poem Jabberwocky. But a straight retelling of the original would be to much of a muchness even with Burtons arresting visuals.""Whos to say what is proper?"" Alice asks at one point and on this we can agree.Its almost as if Burton has been training his entire life for Alice. There are reminders of Edward Scissorhands Beetlejuice Sleepy Hollow and Sweeney Todd in the film along with many hat tips to the fantasy tales Burton has long admired The Wizard of Oz The Lord of The Rings The Chronicles of Narnia and many others.The battle between the Red Queen and the White Queen is highly reminiscent of Wicked the clever offshoot of The Wizard of Oz that has tapped its ruby slippers upon the boards of Broadway.But its by no means all about the excellent visuals which dont require the dubious adornment of 3-D (but you get it anyway). Burton and Woolverton pursue a message of self-fulfilment not as vigorously as they might chase a rabbit but to the same delightful end.Alice isnt the only one finding out about herself; the Red Queen is also forced to consider that age-old question of whether its better to be loved or feared.This new telling of Alice In Wonderland is in a word frabjous. Thats a Carrollian term Wikipedia defines as ""possibly a blend of fair fabulous and joyous."" I couldnt have muttered a better utterance.

Every time the quirky British actress appears on screen to glare purse her lips -- painted to resemble hearts (nice) -- and explosively bark out ""Off with their heads"" Bonham Carters electrifying.That nothing in her real-life partner Tim Burtons 3-D tinkering of the Lewis Carroll adventures -- rumored to have cost 250 million -- matches her isnt an outright slam of the film or of Burton. The ""Sweeney Todd"" actress is such a force here that she could make James Camerons more visually impressive Pandora wilt in the background.

At a couple of key points the studio makes Burton adhere too rigidly to the Disney standard a move that boxes in the madcap director and tempers his bizarreness. Thats obvious in the botched final moments when the screenplay scurries about like the White Rabbit straining to wrap up everything in a neat happily-ever-after package.While the payoff is predictable the world of Wonderland that Burton invents along with the performances other than Anne Hathaways -- a dud as the White Queen -- give ""Alice"" enough enchantment.Advertisement Always a pleasure to watch Depp roots around in his bag of tricks to play the Mad Hatter mashing up ""Benny amp; Joon"" loopiness with his curiouser turn as Willie Wonka. The versatile actor successfully adds a quieter dimension to the complicated Hatter showing us someone struggling mightily to rein in mood swings. Its another example of Depp trumping our expectations. You enter ""Wonderland"" anticipating hell be a maniac on screen; instead he tempers his outlandish character and transforms the Mad Hatter into a sympathetic man-child. He is a refreshing surprise in a sensory experience gone mad almost too mad with sweeping special effects that oscillate from the magnificent (the Red Queens grounds are stunning high points) to the uneven (the White Queens unremarkable kingdom). The Wonderland that Burton imagines rekindles our cherished recollections of Alices adventures while landscaping it in the rich patented Goth look the filmmaker treasures. The dark tone makes the films target audience more along the lines of the ""Twilight"" and college-age set than the SpongeBob sort since its likely to freak out little ones.The plot toys with the two Carroll classics ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking-Glass."" Late in the film we learn that we should start calling Alices secret habitat Underland not Wonderland since a younger Alice mangled the pronunciation during her first rabbit-hole plunge.This revelation is one sign that this ""Alice"" isnt interested in being a mirror image of Carrolls fables an approach that works most of the time while still retaining the wonderment of the first Alice book published in 1865.Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton (Disneys ""Beauty and the Beast"") present us with an older more feminist-minded Alice (relative newcomer Mia Wasikowska who stands tall here in every way). The 19-year-old Alice doesnt fit into tightly buttoned English society especially when she discovers at a tea party that shes likely to become the betrothed of an ugly snob. Our heroine interrupts the proposal by making a mad dash after the forever-late rabbit and well you know where shes headed.Alice discovers shes the key component in ending the feud between squabbling sisters the Red Queen and the White Queen. This gives Burton a chance to really play with effects in a climactic showdown that summons up one frightful Jabberwocky and an army of cards. Its great fun and helps us forgive but not forget lesser scenes including a rather uninspired barreling to the bottom of the rabbit hole and some of the White Queen malarkey. Because of these foibles ""Wonderland"" never quite becomes magical. You leave the theater with a pleasant grin on your face but by no means is it as wide as the Cheshire Cats and thats a shame.""Alice in Wonderland""Rating PG-13 (for fantasy action-violence scary images and a smoking caterpillar)Cast Johnny Depp Mia Wasikowska Helena Bonham Carter Anne Hathaway and Crispin GloverDirector Tim BurtonWriter Linda WoolvertonRunning time 1 hour 49 minutes1/2Print Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Talend Silicon Valleys latest tech IPO has a strong debutSource Tesla looking at cameras radar in Florida crashCartoons Hillary Clinton makes history Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Alice in Wonderland | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; alice-in-wonderland ) Alice in Wonderland (United States 2010) March 05 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli This review is based on an IMAX 3-D screening. Lewis Carrolls ""Wonderland"" stories much like the collected works of Roald Dahl can be perceived from a number of perspectives. Although traditionally seen as a childrens tale Alices Wonderland saga rides a dark undercurrent - something that can be a little creepy and unsettling. For his interpretation Tim Burton - no stranger to the concept of a twisted fairy tale - has softened some of the sharper edges added a dose of high octane action and still managed to keep Alice in Wonderland in touch with its dark side. The movie carries a mild PG rating but may be too intense for younger children. Burton working from a screenplay by Linda Woolverton (who wrote the scripts for two Disney animated classics Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King) brings a fresh perspective to the Alice in Wonderland chronicle while remaining principally faithful to the source material at least in spirit if not in all the particulars. Here Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is not a little girl. Shes a 19-year old woman about to be forced into a socially advantageous but personally odious marriage. When she follows the White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen) down the rabbit hole and into Wonderland its as much to escape from the reality of her current situation as it is to visit a new world. In Wonderland her coming is greeted with interest by the likes of the Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry) and the Blue Caterpillar (voice of Alan Rickman) since it is written that she will be the Champion of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) in her battle against her evil sister the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). Alice is supposed to take up the Vorpal Blade and duel the Jabberwocky (voice of Christopher Lee) - except Alice has no interest in fighting anyone or anything. But after befriending the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) she gains a new respect for the land in which she is trapped. Wonderland is a magical place to behold although it in many ways resembles the otherworld of Narnia as recreated in the recent Disney co-produced pictures The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and Prince Caspian. Although Burton imprints his own macabre humor-tinged signature on a strange and wondrous place where six impossible things happen before breakfast his vision is less overtly weird than it has been for past adaptations of literary works (Sleepy Hollow Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). This is about as close as Burton gets to ""playing it straight"" and the result is engaging. One can quarrel about the level of action at the climax which reinforces a growing belief that all family movies must be as frenetic as possible. (Remember the mini-Scrooge chase scene in Robert Zemeckis A Christmas Carol?) Still while this part of the movie owes more to Burton than to Carroll it is effectively wedded to the overall story; I suspect few outside of Carrolls most devoted advocates will mind. Mia Wasikowska a 20-year old Australian-born actress is immensely appealing Alice. Her interpretation of the character emphasizes all the right qualities bravery compassion faithfulness and heroism. Even though the dimensions of her body keep changing the size of Alices heart remains the same. For Wasikowska despite not being a complete unknown in North America having appeared in the monster movie Rogue and the HBO TV series In Treatment this will expand her recognition into the stratosphere. She makes Alice in Wonderland her own stealing it away from supporting actor Johnny Depp. Speaking of Depp hes a bit of a disappointment. The role of The Mad Hatter requires little more of Depp than that he act bizarre while going a little over-the-top - something he does exceedingly well. Theres not much of a character there. Its almost as if Depp is on hand mainly because of the drawing power of his name. In fact there has been a quality of sameness in Depps most recent three live-action collaborations with Burton (with Sweeney Todd and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory preceding this one). Maybe its time for them to take a break from one another. A few words must be said about the decision to release Alice in Wonderland in 3-D its a money-grab. At best 3-D is extraneous; at worst its distracting. The colors are muted and there is noticeable blurring during some of the most rapid action sequences. In the wake of Avatar which raised the bar for 3-D Alice in Wonderland is discouraging. I can imagine this will be a more enjoyable experience in 2-D. I remarked in my review of Avatar that the sense of immersion was so strong I forgot I was wearing the 3-D glasses. That was not the case here. Comparing this live-action special effects-rich version of Alice in Wonderland to the popular 1951 animated version is as ill-advised as comparing it to The Wizard of Oz with which it shares traits. Burton has crafted something all-new for this generation and has done a solid job with his re-imagining. Its a workmanlike effort that will enchant all but the youngest children while holding the interest of parents. That by definition makes for a worthwhile family outing.

For those who were wowed with the look of Avatar but put off by the wooden characters and clunky dialogue now theres Alice in all her ""muchness."" Alice in Wonderlands menagerie of characters range from mildly loopy to certifiably insane. But theyre immensely fun and what they have to say has charm and verve. TRAILER Get a sense of Alice PHOTOS Meet the amazing beings of Wonderland GO DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE Wonderland looks curiouser but Burton fills gaps in story Director Tim Burton has reimagined Lewis Carrolls classic tale in a way that might put some purists off. But the story he presents with a more empowered 19-year-old Alice is engaging and amusing. The visual landscape in which she travels is awash in color magic and splendor. What is often forgotten in the more sanitized and sweet versions of Alice in Wonderland is that Carrolls story is essentially about growing up which entails some dark experiences. Burtons distinctive cinematic style makes this eclectic fantasy -- infused with both dark and light -- a dynamic marriage of original material and modern filmmaker. Though there a few moments when the plot meanders the inventive turns mostly keep the momentum going. The only misstep comes as the credits roll with a pop song by Avril Lavigne that sounds like a generic version of one of her previous hits and seems to pander to a teen audience. Its inclusion is unnecessary and jarring. As Alice Mia Wasikowska is pitch-perfect looking the part and capturing her sense of innocence. Shes a girl unlike most of her stuffy Victorian set out of step with her peers preferring to take off in vivid flights of imagination. A proposal from a stupefyingly dorky but aristocratic young man (Leo Bill) awaits her. But as Alice prepares her rejection shes distracted by a white rabbit sporting a pocket watch (voiced by Michael Sheen). Soon she has fallen down the famous rabbit hole and her topsy-turvy adventure is underway. Burton artfully creates animated characters such as the White Rabbit the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry) and the Jabberwocky (Christopher Lee). British comic Matt Lucas is the heart and soul of computer-generated Tweedledee and Tweedledum. But Burton also wisely calls upon his dual muses Johnny Depp as the addled Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the imperious Red Queen. Depp is terrific as the carrot-topped wonky-eyed Mad Hatter a character given more depth than in previous clownish incarnations. Bonham Carter though steals the show with her hilarious verbosity. Theres a lot more to her than fiery exhortations of ""Off with your head"" However heads loom large for her. She sports a particularly outsized and bulbous cranium the object of much jesting. The Mad Hatter admires her protruding skull unabashedly ""Id love to hat it"" he burbles. It turns out that Wonderland is actually called Underland -- which makes directional sense -- and Alice had visited more than a dozen years before. In her absence Underland has deteriorated under the Red Queens reign of terror. Its up to Alice to side with the peaceful if somewhat odd White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and make things right. The movie should come with a note marked ""Watch me"" for its extravagance of whimsy and wonder.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Sexual panic is the last thing youd expect to prod Alice to get her ass down a rabbit hole. But hell this is Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland not your third-grade teachers version. Scholars of British author Lewis Carroll (1832-1898) will no doubt shriek ""Off with Burtons head"" for the liberties he takes in this 3-D mix of live action and animation. In the script that Linda Woolverton (The Lion King Beauty and the Beast) has woven often forcibly from Alices Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass things have changed -- dramatically. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> For starters Alice is no longer seven years old. As played with feminist fire by Mia Wasikowska (so good as the suicidal erotically confused gymnast in HBOs In Treatment) Alice now 19 is her own woman. No way is she marrying the dweeb her guardians have chosen for her. So when the White Rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen) interrupts her engagement party Alice returns to Underland (the real name). She doesnt remember the old gang but theyre there. Some in the flesh -- the mood-swinging Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) the good-but-goofy White Queen (Anne Hathaway) the villainous giant-headed Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and her creepy Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover a genuine wizard of odd). Other characters are animated and voiced by the cream of Brit talent such as Absolem the caterpillar (Alan Rickman) the Cheshire cat (Stephen Fry) Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both Matt Lucas) and that dragon of a Jabberwocky (Sir Christopher Lee his voice breathing fire). Its a setup for magic that only fitfully comes. Burton is a visionary but the film was shot in 2-D and converted to 3-D a process that lets the seams show in a way they dont in say Avatar. Worse theres a character jam that lets the film go inert and lose sight of Alices goals to kill the Jabberwocky and find self-enlightenment. The actors help enormously but only a few are given the time to stretch out and insinuate themselves. Bonham Carter gets laughs whether shes warming her feet on a squealing pig or ordering decapitations like lattes. Better yet she shows how the regrettable size of the Queens head has made her a freak in her own mind. Depp is a marvel as the Hatter orange hair sprouting as a result of poisoning from the mercury used in making hats. He handles Carrolls language so well that you wish more of it had slipped into the script. Love for Alice shines out of his eyes. But those hoping for a peek into the alleged perversity of Carrolls interest in young girls wont find it here. Still even Disney and a PG rating cant bury Burtons subversive wit. Like Carroll hes a master at dressing up psychic wounds in fantasy. If youre looking for the trippy bounce of Jefferson Airplanes ""White Rabbit"" with its wisdom in the shrooms it can be found. Like Alice you just have to dig for it. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Tim Burtons film imposes a second identity crisis on the tale that of a director uncertain of how to proceed. Is this a remake or a sequel? Comedy or action-fantasy? A kid-friendly Disney picture or a dark gnarled Burton film? Is it set in Wonderland Narnia or Willy Wonka world? Even the look of the film is compromised by lukewarm 3D effects applied in post-production. Indecision haunts every frame. The result is a clattering hectic spectacle that by the end has run out of inspiration. Its a home for abandoned ideas. Commercial considerations seem to have guided the decision to make this films Alice a nubile 19-year-old the better to appeal to the crucial teen market. And so we have needless bookends to the story opening with a Peter-Pan-over-the-rooftops-of-London introduction to 6-year-old Alice and her Papa a visionary merchant with wild dreams of opening up new Pacific trade routes. Alice troubled by nightmares of a strange underground kingdom needs reassurance before bed. ""Youre bonkers"" he says with a smile. ""All the best people are."" Thirteen years later Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is being pushed into an arranged engagement by her widowed Mum (starchy Lindsay Duncan). At a lavish garden reception the chinless young aristocrat asks for her hand. ""I need a moment"" she protests fleeing the scene and tumbling into a rabbit hole. Down here she encounters the usual Burton aquarium of bizarre creatures dragons and insects and scales and tails and tendrils exotic vegetation and foliage and enough gargoyles to protect a hundred cathedrals. The film looks as though a dozen production designers competed to see who could achieve the most outrageous folly. Filigree grows over everything like visual kudzu. This is Underland where topsy is turvy and nothing fits. Burton visualizes Carrolls characters with eccentric flair. Helena Bonham Carter makes a ticklish impact as Her Scarlet Highness. With a bulbous balloon noggin atop a diminutive frame she is inflated ego incarnate and her peevish performance is a delight. As the pallid White Queen Anne Hathaway is another of Burtons corpselike lust objects Snow White on formaldehyde. ALICE IN WONDERLAND  out of 4 stars Rating PG for fantasy action/violence. Of course the main event is Johnny Depp a human special effect as the Mad Hatter with his neon-orange fright wig ruby-toned rouge and computer-enlarged emerald eyes. He oscillates between eccentricity and insanity his accent shifting from cockney to Scots while his wardrobe changes color to reflect his mercurial moods. Its a clowning Christmas pageant performance but suited to the part. Alice is told at every turn she isnt ""the right Alice."" And in truth Alice has a marked lack of personality at first. Wasikowska underplays her characters wonderment attributing her experiences to a bad dream. A scroll foretelling the future names her as the champion who will defeat the Red Queens dragon Jabberwocky. Alice doesnt see it that way; shes temporarily stranded and will be waking up any minute now. Two-thirds of the film is spent waiting for her to get on with the sword-fighting. The tacked-on battle finale entirely misses the point of this Victorian coming-of-age fable. It doesnt update the story it shreds it. The producers must think that turning Wonderland into Gondor is how you give audiences their moneys worth. After Alice drinks a shrinking potion the Mad Hatter remarks ""Youve lost your muchness."" If Burton had scaled back the muchness he might not have smothered the lovely fairy tale underneath.

Nor is Tim Burtons inspired mash-up of action fantasies your grannys magic-mushroom milkshake of Lewis Carrolls mindbender.If there were truth-in-titling Burtons movie rightly would be called Alice in Narnia With Stops at Disneyland the Shire Rohan Naboo and Oz.The White Rabbit is here. As are the Mad Hatter Queen of Hearts and Cheshire Cat. But as reimagined by Linda Woolverton Disneys resident girl-power scribe (Beauty and the Beast Mulan) and re-envisioned by Burton these characters do not conform to their story lines in Carrolls Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass. They are chess pieces in a gaudily entertaining fan fiction about a nonconformists coming-of-age.Alice (Mia Wasikowska the troubled teen on In Treatment) is a 19th-century 19-year-old a brisk tea of dreaminess and defiance. For years she has puzzled over nightmares that her father an adventurer encouraged her to learn from. Fast forward Dad is dead and Mom wants to marry Alice off to a twitty lord son of Dads business partner.While Alice considers said twits proposal she follows a white bunny down down down the rabbit hole to the upside-down universe of what here is called ""Underland.""This implicit reference to lady parts is a motif of the Woolverton/Burton fantasia which structures Alices trek as a heros journey through female archetypes. Only after tasting the rancorous rule of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter Burtons real-life partner) and the damsel-in-distress dithering of the White Queen does Alice ultimately emerge a woman warrior.What fun Burton has in visualizing the different sensibilities of the monarchs Though his narrative like Carrolls follows no logical path imagistically the film is rich and allusive. (Why is there a visual reference to Padme and Anakin Skywalkers wedding in Star Wars II? No idea.) The film which is like most spectacles nowadays in 3-D does not use the added dimension in any particularly innovative way. The innovation is in its visuals.The balloon-headed Red Queen lives in a palace that resembles Sleeping Beautys at Disneyland only drenched in maraschino-cherry sauce. And the floss-haired White Queen resides in a spun-sugar castle resembling something Narnian. And also Oz-like as the good and bad queens are like the good and bad witches.(Disney which produced Alice in Wonderland likewise made the Narnia films and doubtless has plans to use the elaborate sets for this movie in its theme parks.)It is whimsical to read about the Red Queens playing croquet with a flamingo for a mallet and hedgehog for a ball. But it is enchanting to see an apparently real (if digitized) flamingo and hedgehog used for the games.The battle between other game pieces the Red Queens scarlet playing-card soldiers and the White Queens ivory chessmen-at-arms makes for the films most spectacular set piece the game board as epic battlefield. Kind of like the battle of Helms Deep in Lord of the Rings but dynamically choreographed.Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter like a Scottish fairy-godbrother jibber-jabbering in a brogue thats almost impenetrable. He doesnt bring much to the tea party but its always fun to watch him crack himself up. Better are the mischievous Cheshire Cat (purring voice supplied by Stephen Fry) and hookah-puffing caterpillar (sepulchral tones courtesy of Alan Rickman) who are more helpful as Underland guides.As Alice regards the diabolical Red Queen and her angelic younger sister she rejects the two prevailing archetypes of womanhood the bitch and the goddess to pursue what she explicitly calls her ""own path."" In the WoolBurton version of Alices metamorphosis the heroine is a caterpillar who becomes a butterfly.Carroll purists are likely to dismiss this Alice as spuriouser and spuriouser.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + If youre like me youre heading into ""Alice in Wonderland not expecting a faithful adaptation of Lewis Carroll but a good Tim Burton movie. Possibly a great Tim Burton movie. And the first few scenes dont disappoint Mia Wasikowska is dreamily pallid as the 18-year-old Alice a lanky pre-Raphaelite bucking against her rigid Victorian society. A garden party at which the girl is proposed to by an upper-class twit (Leo Bill) is a visual marvel of topiary and pastel-blue skies as though a 19th-century postcard had been hand-tinted by a surrealist.Then the movie goes down the rabbit hole and takes the wonder with it. Theres nothing in itself wrong with a revisionist ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland - lord knows dozens of other moviemakers good bad and indifferent have taken a crack at it. But where Burton and his screenwriter Linda Woolverton go astray is turning this new 3-D version - a sequel really about a grown Alice returning to the psychic dreamworld of her childhood - into a fantasy adventure that looks like every other CGI epic out there.All right a Burton-ized CGI epic with the filmmakers trademark gnarled trees a Tweedledum and Tweedledee (both played by Matt Lucas) who resemble miniature Pugsleys and Danny Elfmans score galumphing in the background. And of course Burtons partner Helena Bonham Carter as the Queen of Hearts her gigantic cranium towering over an itsy-bitsy body like an evil bobblehead.It says a lot about this movie though that Carters role is now essentially a reprise of the White Witch in the Narnia films a beastly diva who needs to be vanquished for peace to reign once more over Underland (not Wonderland; apparently the young Alice was hard of hearing). Nor do you need to be a film freak to ID the movies other elements and influences; you just need to have seen enough blockbusters and played a few video games.There are bits of ""The Lord of the Rings ""Shrek ""The Wizard of Oz ""The Princess Bride even ""The Golden Compass all given a wash of chic Gothic gloom. Im not accusing Burton of intentional theft just of working within a profitable mainstream fantasy-action framework that by now feels over familiar even to the 12-year-old who sat next to me at the screening. In its big-budget extraordinariness ""Alice is awfully . . . ordinary.Hows Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter? Enjoyable and also typical of the movies problems. The Hatters now a major supporting role Alices guide and heroic protector as she seeks the Vorpal Sword and gets ready to battle the Jabberwocky on Frabjous Day. (Yes the script is that literal.) Depp is unrecognizable under his Carrot Top fright-wig and kabuki pancake but he brings the wounded gentleness of Edward Scissorhands to his brief bouts of sanity. For the first time though the star feels over-indulged by his longtime director as though playing a madman gave Depp license to run amok. (It doesnt.) This isnt a bad performance - provided you can wipe one dreadful break-dance routine from your mind - just an unstructured one.Most of the thought as youd expect has gone into the art direction. The look of ""Alice in Wonderland is a mixture of the intriguingly grotesque and the big-movie banal with a heaping side dish of Maxfield Parrish. There are sublime inventions - the stressed-out little monkeys pigs and frogs who serve as the Queens minions - and Colleen Atwoods costumes adapt to Alices changing size with ingenious grace. But the visuals are just as often busy without being interesting and Burton uses 3-D in shockingly hackneyed ways. (Watch out the March Hare just threw a teacup at your head.) Its a movie to make you appreciate everything ""Avatar does so astonishingly right.There are gems to be found in the vocal performances. Stephen Fry turns the Cheshire Cat into the films Puck-ish wild card Timothy Spall gives gravitas to a heroic talking bloodhound (maybe he got lost on the way to ""Up) and much more of Alan Rickmans big blue caterpillar would have been welcome. Of the human actors its good to see Crispin Glover channel his inner Rathbone as the Knave of Hearts but Anne Hathaway abandoned by her director flails as the Glinda-like White Queen. Even Wasikowska ends up more oppressed by the films own machinations than by the stuffy Victorians above ground.What you miss above all is nonsense - the subversive upending of logic and proper behavior that Carroll packed into every sideways phrase he wrote. An ""Alice adaptation doesnt have to be faithful in any aspect but that; without nonsense its just another artifact of the prevailing consumer culture. Burton is that rarity an outsider who has long been embraced by the mainstream and success has finally dulled his edge. ""Alice in Wonderland sadly could have been made by anyone.

"Movie review Tim Burtons refreshing take on Alice in Wonderland washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Alice in Wonderland Movie review Tim Burtons refreshing take on Alice in Wonderland Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday March 5 2010 Is there a better movie-match than Lewis Carroll and Tim Burton? With ""Alice in Wonderland"" his boldly revisionist remix of Carrolls beloved tales of a young girls journey down a rabbit hole and through a looking glass Burton finely balances excess and restraint to create an absorbing visually rich world of his very own. Burton has wisely avoided producing a mere pop-up illustration of the books instead finding inspiration in Alice the Mad Hatter the Red Queen and other familiar characters and putting them into a brand-new story. His most nervy decision -- making Alice a 19-year-old young woman on the verge of a tiresome marriage -- also proves to be his best. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is not just a refreshingly feminist version of the classic hero quest but a forum for a terrific breakout performance from newcomer Mia Wasikowska. After a brief preamble featuring young Alice after a very strange dream involving a waistcoat-wearing rabbit ""Alice in Wonderland"" leaps forward 13 years when she is on her way to being engaged to a wealthy but dull aristocrat. At the engagement party Alice spies the busy rabbit again chases after him and falls down a dusty tunnel. She winds up not in Wonderland but Underland a place suffering under the rule of the cruel and petulant Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). When Alice meets a hookah-smoking caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman) shes informed that her destiny lies in returning the throne to the Red Queens gentle sister the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) after slaying the dreaded Jabberwocky. Burtons signature gnarled gothic aesthetic runs through ""Alice in Wonderland"" which features Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter he of the oddly dilated pupils and accents that run from a lusty Scottish brogue to an upper-crusty lisp. Its worth the price of admission if only to hear Depp give sonorous voice to Carrolls slithy toves and borogoves but its the women who steal the show from the somber self-possessed Wasikowska (familiar to fans of HBOs ""In Treatment"") to Bonham Carters scenery-chewing tantrums to Hathaways very funny turn as a too-too good girl. ""Alice in Wonderland"" is being shown in 3-D but the most stunning effects lie in the films ingenious makeup and costumes as well as tricks that elongate or fatten the characters bodies (or in the case of Bonham Carter inflate her head to dirigible-like proportions). Most important ""Alice in Wonderland"" honors the more tender subtexts of the Alice stories having to do with isolation and loss. Even considering the liberties Burton has taken with the original text its tempting to think that Carroll himself would consider him an altogether frabjous match. PG. At area theaters. Contains fantasy action/violence involving scary images and situations and a smoking caterpillar. 109 minutes.

Share Tweet Lewis Carrolls Alices Adventures In Wonderland and Through The Looking Glass though filled with references to Victorian Oxford belong to the eternal realm of fancy and nonsense. Beginning with a childs tendency to misunderstand the adult world then putting it on the unsure footing of fantasy wordplay and circular logic Carroll allows wonder and nightmares to live side by side. The Alice books have inspired an abundance of adaptations and spin-offs over the years drawing everyone from Walt Disney to Jan Svankmajer to Tom Waits down the rabbit hole. The best adaptations have found ways to put a personal stamp on the familiar stories. Others have simply reproduced an Alice facsimile in the image of their own era. Surprisingly Tim Burtons Alice In Wonderland belongs to the latter camp. That doesnt necessarily make it a bad movie just another frustratingly impersonal one from a director who once had trouble compacting his personality down to movie size. Filled with 3D-friendly CGI landscapes and roaring beasties Burtons Alice borrows characters and settings from Carroll but otherwise trashes Wonderland (or ""Underland"" as Disney veteran Linda Woolverton would have it in her screenplay). Gone the liquid reality of dreams and a sense that anything can happen. In its place another story of quests destinies and chosen ones. The Jabberwocky March Hare and Cheshire Cat all appear but absent Carrolls hallucinatory playfulness. The winningly scowly Mia Wasikowska plays Alice a 19-year-old who vaguely remembers a strange place that used to haunt her dreams then gets a chance to revisit it after fleeing the marriage proposal of a twittish titled suitor. Once in the land of Tweedles Dee and Dum she encounters talking animals a smoking caterpillar and other colorful characters who suspect shes the Alice fated to save them from the tyranny of the bulbous-headed Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). A curiously unmemorable Johnny Depp co-stars as a not-that-mad intermittently Scottish Mad Hatter. As with most of his co-stars even the reliably outre Crispin Glover his performance too often defers to the unfailingly impressive special effects around him. In spite of the voice talents of Alan Rickman Stephen Fry and others only Carters Red Queen--played as a petulant lackey-surrounded movie star--peels herself off the page to become a memorable character. Everyone else mostly behaves like functionaries in yet another outsized battle between good and evil that plays like the best Chronicles Of Narnia movie never made. Its Alice in name but Alices spirit remains somewhere else.

"Review Alice in Wonderland - LA Times ENTERTAINMENT ENTERTAINMENT Review Alice in Wonderland Wonderland combat Associated Press Burton and company have taken special care to provide pictures of Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as a warrior princess in full Joan of Arc armor as a female empowerment icon for the girls in the audience. Burton and company have taken special care to provide pictures of Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as a warrior princess in full Joan of Arc armor as a female empowerment icon for the girls in the audience. (Associated Press) Kenneth Turan FILM CRITIC gt;gt;gt; One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small and the pills Tim Burton gives you dont do very much at all. With apologies to Jefferson Airplanes ""White Rabbit"" that more or less sums up ""Alice in Wonderland"" the directors middling new version of the Lewis Carroll tale. It has its successful moments but its surprisingly inert overall more like a Burton derivative than something he actually did himself. Through no fault of its own ""Alice"" also has the misfortune of being the first major 3-D release to come out after the ""Avatar"" revolution and when you add in that Burton chose to shoot in 2-D and have the footage converted it inevitably plays like one of the last gasps of the old-fashioned ways of doing things.Especially old-school is the framing device devised by veteran Disney animation screenwriter Linda Woolverton (""Beauty and the Beast"" ""The Lion King""). In this version Alice is introduced as a 6-year-old girl troubled by visions of falling down a hole and ""seeing all these creatures"" episodes her kindly dad assures her are nothing but dreams. Then its 13 years later and Alice is a pouty young woman (Australian actress Mia Wasikowska) headed for a posh garden party with her mother. Alice is a bit of a rebel (she doesnt wear a corset) and though she doesnt know it shes on the way to what her family hopes will be her engagement party. But once we meet Alices intended a complete twit named Hamish we know that marriage is not going to happen and a good thing too for this part of the film is so tedious we are all but begging for the escape the rabbit hole provides especially because it serves as a portal to Burtons inventive mind.Alice is soon desperate to flee as well and following the traditional white rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen) she hurtles down the hole and confronts a world of wonders where animals talk and even flowers speak their minds.Given the strength of Burtons imagination its not surprising that many of these creatures are engaging especially if like that rabbit they are voiced by top British actors. The unsettling Cheshire Cat ( Stephen Fry) is hard to forget as are Absolem the Blue Caterpillar ( Alan Rickman) Bayard the Bloodhound (Timothy Spall) and fright legend Christopher Lee as the dread Jabberwocky.Rather less satisfying is the scripts notion that the creatures spend much of their time bickering as to whether this Alice is the same person who came down the rabbit hole a decade earlier and if she is whether she has ""lost her muchness"" in the intervening years. They even give her a hard time for getting the name of the location wrong Its Underland shes disdainfully told not Wonderland.These disputes soon become tiresome even if one of Alices champions is played by Johnny Depp. His Mad Hatter is a genuine fashionista whom we get to see designing wacky headgear like there is no tomorrow. Theres no denying Depps gifts and abilities but this performance feels both indulgent and something weve all seen before.What is even more unfortunate is the films attempt to turn itself into an Underland version of ""The Lord of the Rings"" complete with massed forces of good and evil inevitably headed toward a sadly generic CGI battle to end all battles. Inspiring the powers of light is the White Queen ( Anne Hathaway) while heading the wicked side is her sister the dyspeptic Red Queen ( Helena Bonham Carter) and Stayne the Knave of Hearts ( Crispin Glover) her 7-foot-6 top general.All these people are in a lather about Alice because it turns out that a venerable document called the Oraculum has foretold that Alice will return to lead the forces of light and slay the dark sides champion the mighty Jabberwocky.Alice of course insists she is the nonviolent sort and likely to do no such thing but frankly what does she know?With those battle scenes in place to please the boys Burton and company have taken special care to provide pictures of Alice as a warrior princess in full Joan of Arc armor as a female empowerment icon for the girls in the audience.While that kind of thing is always in short supply it would be nicer if that image -- and the movie as a whole -- felt less like corporate moves and more like situations that came from the heart.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Tim Burton Johnny Depp Michael Sheen Avatar (movie) Mia Wasikowska Alice in Wonderland Tim Burtons imaginary friends Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-alice4-2010mar04,0,7137809.story",200,aliceinwonderland(2010)24,aliceinwonderland(2010),latimes

The images or more specifically the gifts of imagination turn out to be more important and indelible than the story. Tim Burtons new 3-D semi-animated take falls firmly into this tradition for better and for worse. Theres always something on-screen to tickle the eyeballs be it the doughy compressed features of Tweedledee and Tweedledum the bright orange shock of hair atop the head of Johnny Depps Mad Hatter or the variously oppressed members of the Red Queens court.But the narrative arc and dramatic momentum are inert pretty much from the moment Alice (Mia Wasikowska) departs her prim Victorian surroundings for a world of distorted logic and anthropomorphic beasties voiced by stalwarts including Alan Rickman Timothy Spall Michael Sheen and Stephen Fry.It should also be said that this isnt your grandmothers Alice. Resistant to the idea of marriage on anyones terms but her own striking a chic figure in form-fitting armor in her climactic battle with a lean mean Jabberwock shes a 19-year-old thoroughly modern heroine at odds with a world eager to impart its Victorian values. As such shes also a strong role model for young girls although there are moments when its hard to tell who this movie is for. Its a scary sight to see Alice walk toward the Red Queens castle upon a sea of human heads. (Said Queen played by Helena Bonham Carter with a digitally enhanced bulbous cranium has more fun demanding instant decapitation than any villain this side of Shakespeares Richard III). Long story short Bring the kiddies at your own risk.If youve seen a bus go by in the past few months you know this is Depps show and his fans shouldnt leave disappointed. He continues his knack for embodying human but otherworldly characters and he gives life to quirks and mannerisms that would be annoying in the hands of other actors. The wide eyes and high whimsy feel a bit derivative of his Willy Wonka (another collaboration with Burton) but he invests so much of his ample energy and instinct in these roles that its hard to complain.As much as we hate to bring the A-word into play here the 3-D effects of this Wonderland seem a little flat and haphazardly layered especially after the stunning depth of field and texture on display in Avatar. The best visuals here come in close-up largely because the different elements dont appear fully integrated and the backdrops and settings look a little blurry and washed out as if they were enhanced after the fact. Which they were Burton converted his 2-D footage to 3-D when he was done shooting a more time-efficient process that nonetheless already seems inadequate in this post-Pandora world.

Elizabeth Weitzman Updated Thursday March 4 2010 154 PM Title Alice in Wonderland According to ""Alice in Wonderland"" ""the only way to achieve the impossible is to believe it is possible."" Surely it would be tough to find a better motto for director Tim Burton. He rarely worries about what can or should be done; he just goes ahead and does it. Sometimes the results are magical and occasionally they teeter toward disaster. ""Alice"" falls somewhere in between It tends to get lost in its own delirium which will enchant some and drive others bonkers.Then again Burton believes the best people are bonkers so he has little regard for anyone unwilling to enter his funhouse. And he certainly isnt intimidated by his classic sources This version is more inspired by Lewis Carrolls ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking-Glass"" than based on them.Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is now 19 and so unsettled by her impending engagement that she escapes down a nearby rabbit hole. What she finds underground however is hardly comforting. According to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) shes destined to save Wonderland from the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and rescue the beloved White Queen (Anne Hathaway). But shell have to kill the dragonlike Jabberwock first.As with ""Avatar"" the plot is mostly a device on which the director hangs his visual fantasies blending live action and CG characters into a dreamlike 3-D world. And as with most risky ventures mistakes are made. While Matt Lucas Tweedledee and Tweedledum amuse Alan Rickmans Caterpillar and Stephen Frys Cheshire Cat should be sharper. Bonham Carters petulant fits are hilarious but Hathaways fluttery mannerisms simply grate. (Youll either love or hate Depps wild-eyed Hatter.)Wasikowska adorned by needlessly showy costumes looks and behaves a bit too much like she belongs on a runway. Still how delightful to see such a self-sufficient young heroine -- a rarity that feels as frabjous as any other wonder in this whimsically overstuffed land.""Frabjous"" may be a word Carroll invented but Burton knows just what it means at least in his own mind. Hes clearly excited to invite us inside and as long as youre open to so much muchness youll be very glad he did.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Alice in Wonderland their seventh film together is so thoroughly soul-deadening and laborious that the prospect of an eighth collaboration feels like the sword of Damocles. Based on Lewis Carrolls books Alices Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass this latest big-screen version of the seminal classics finds a 19-year-old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) heading down the rabbit hole once again but with no memory of her prior visit; those looking for an origin story will have to settle for the 1951 animated version. Once in Wonderland--or as it is called by the locals Underland--Alice must defeat the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and return the benevolent White Queen (Anne Hathaway) to her rightful throne. Perhaps because the plot can basically fit on the inside of a matchbook Mr. Burton decided that an over-reliance on bells and whistles was necessary. He bathes Alice in Wonderland in so much distracting 3-D computer animation and ethereal landscapes that both James Cameron and Peter Jackson would recoil in disgust. Consider Alice the unwanted spawn of Avatar and The Lovely Bones. There are giant flying birds growling doglike creatures and even something called the Jabberwocky a monster right out of The Lord of the Rings. (Its even voiced by Saruman himself Christopher Lee.) Those hoping to be transported to a new world will have to settle for a hodgepodge of old ones. To wit Alice rides on the back of a furry beast--in a style reminiscent of The Neverending Story--not once not twice but thrice. Alice in Wonderland has all of Mr. Burtons hallmarks--the silhouetted and broken tree branches the haunting Danny Elfman score the pasty heroine (Ms. Wasikowska has an inside track on playing the lead in The Claire Danes Story)--but the film comes off like something directed by a novice who spent one too many afternoons in the Tim Burton exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art. Not one moment during the 108-minute film feels authentic. Neither does Mr. Depps central performance as the Mad Hatter. While Ms. Wasikowska is fine enough her Alice is written as a straight woman; shes required to do nothing more than react to the green-screen creations surrounding her. Mr. Depp is tasked with the heavy lifting but festooned in an orange fright wig and some very uncomfortable-looking contact lenses he cant even be bothered to keep his accent straight (it vacillates between an effete lisp and an angry Scottish brogue). When he was donning black eyeliner and doing an elaborate Keith Richards impression in Pirates of the Caribbean you could sense the fun Mr. Depp was having while nailing a tricky performance. In Alice in Wonderland though he acts like even being on set was a chore. It wouldnt have been a surprise to see him break the fourth wall take the blue pill and return home to Paris. Frankly with how much the film drags youll probably wish he had. editorialobserver.com Comment Filed under Alice in Wonderland Helena Bonham Carter Johnny Depp Movie Review Tim Burton Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/malice-wonderland,200,aliceinwonderland(2010)27,aliceinwonderland(2010),observer

For anyone old enough to know the Queen of Hearts is a savage parody of a certain autocratic breed of political high haughtiness; for kids shes just a witchy lady with a frighteningly big and ugly head. Carrolls classic of course is far from the only kiddie fantasia that operates on levels children cant see. Whats unique about it is that an adults raised-eyebrow smirk is built into the very tone and structure of the story. Once Alice tumbles into Wonderland everyone she meets is if not certifiable then a blithely self-absorbed nattering crackpot-narcissist. The book is a visionary satire of the newly emerging modern world in which everyone is really babbling to no one but themselves. The challenge of adapting Alice in Wonderland is this How do you create relationships a story a purpose out of a tale whose prime purpose is not to have one? Tim Burton with his crazy love for rabbit-hole alternative worlds (Beetlejuice) baroque oddballs (Batman Edward Scissorhands) and kiddie fables told with a cynical wink (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) would seem to be the perfect director to adapt Carrolls legendary tale and make a memorable zany-dark movie out of it. But Burtons Disneyfied 3-D Alice in Wonderland written by the girl-power specialist Linda Woolverton (Beauty and the Beast) is a strange brew indeed murky diffuse and meandering set not in a Wonderland that pops with demented life but in a world called Underland thats like a joyless bombed-out version of Wonderland. It looks like a CGI head trip gone postapocalyptic. In the films rather humdrum 3-D the place doesnt dazzle -- it droops. Alice instead of the spunky girl we remember is now a rather stern 19-year-old Victorian ingenue who is visiting the place for the second time even though she can hardly remember the first. (No it doesnt make any more sense when youre watching it.) She seems actively annoyed to be there. The young actress Mia Wasikowska with her Pre-Raphaelite look gives Alice a beaming sensual intelligence (she frowns beautifully) but wherever Alice goes she never displays the slightest hint of curiosity. The characters she meets are certainly eye-catching. The White Rabbit (voiced by Michael Sheen) percolates with antic charm and Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Matt Lucas) are fleshy twins that make it look as if Glenn Beck had just given birth to Cabbage Patch Kids. The Cheshire Cat with electric blue stripes is voiced by Stephen Fry in drolly amused dry-sherry tones. Then theres Johnny Depp who plays the Mad Hatter with radioactive emerald eyes an exploding Bozo carrot top and a gaze of luminous dementia. Hes a fantastic image but once Depp opens his mouth what comes out is a noisome Scottish brogue that makes everything he says sound more or less the same. The character offers no captivatingly skewed bat-house psychology. There isnt much to him really -- hes just a smiling Johnny one-note with a secret hip-hop dance move -- and so we start to react to him the way that Alice does to everything else by wondering when hes going to stop making nonsense. Depps counterpart in shrill sameness is Helena Bonham Carter who plays the Red Queen (a composite of the Queen of Hearts and a character from the 1872 Alice sequel Through the Looking-Glass) in striking Klaus Nomi makeup but without much to say besides ""Off with his head"" Boy does that get old. The movie cobbles together both of Lewis Carrolls Alice books and his fantastical-beastie poem ""Jabberwocky."" But it also fluffs out the tale with a bland mash of Disney heroics. The Red Queen has a saintly sister (Anne Hathaway made up for some reason to look like the Italian porn-star politician La Cicciolina) Alice has to fight a dragon -- the Jabberwocky -- and the film builds to a CGI battle that might have come out of a lesser Narnia sequel.

RELATED Alice is an ageless icon Alice on DVD Spotlight Johnny Depp Spotlight Anne Hathaway Family fantasy films Disney/Pixar movies Movie queens From bestseller to film Alice in Wonderland merchandise Carroll purists and freshman English majors may be aghast at the change in story but for those who watched ""Avatar"" and marveled at the images but were left wanting by the wooden acting and tired story ""Alice"" is a treat. The comparison is apt as much of ""Alice"" looks like it could have been shot on the same virtual back lot as James Camerons blockbuster. Combining elements of ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" with its sequel ""Through the Looking Glass"" Burtons film begins with a young Alice awakening from a nightmare in which she visited Wonderland filled with strange creatures like a white rabbit in a waistcoat. Has she gone around the bend she worriedly asks her father? Yes he says shes assuredly bonkers. But dont worry ""all the best people are."" Jumping forward 13 years Alice (now played by Mia Wasikowska) is almost 20 a beautiful young woman who has inherited her now-dead fathers free spirit to the consternation of her mother (Lindsay Duncan) appalled that Alice would refuse to wear a corset to a party. Little does Alice know that the party is for Hamish (Leo Bill) a drip of a fellow with poor digestion to propose to her in front of the assembled guests. Caught off-guard Alice asks for a moment to think sees the rabbit in the waistcoat from the dreams shes had since childhood and follows it falling down a hole. And thus she lands in Wonderland. Only now its Underland and while the familiar creatures are there - the rabbit (Michael Sheen) the Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry) the Blue Caterpillar (Alan Rickman) - they all demand to know if she is the right Alice. Will she defeat the Jabberwocky and end the reign of the evil Red Queen? She doesnt understand the questions and grows even more confused - who wouldnt? - at the Mad Hatters unhinged tea party. The Hatter (Johnny Depp dipping into the insanity well for another signature performance) tells her of the atrocities committed by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and dreams of the day when her sister the virtuous White Queen (Anne Hathaway) will have her reign restored. The Hatter challenges Alice. ""Youve lost your muchness"" he scolds. She doesnt understand what he means but over time she and the audience will learn and shell find it. Her self-confidence grows even as her body grows and shrinks. When she arrives in Underland she is content to treat it all as a dream. By the time she is warned that she dare not divert from the path of events her presence sets in motion she roars ""I MAKE the path"" Wasikowska is the right Alice for the film believable both as the young woman addled by a surprise marriage proposal and the eventual warrior who dons a suit of armor for the climactic battle against the Jabberwocky (Christopher Lee). Depp is exactly what youd expect which is a good thing. Gap-toothed and leering at times he looks like Madonna after sticking a fork in a toaster. How he finds his characters is anybodys guess a sort of thrift-store warehouse of eccentricities it seems like. But it works. Crispin Glover is shockingly normal for him as Stayne the Knave of Hearts. But Bonham Carter is great as the Red Queen all oversized head and pampered fury a heartless woman who comes to believe its better to be feared than loved. There is a right way and a wrong way to scream ""Off with his head"" Hers is the right way. Shes a delight. While the psychedelic landscapes are eye-popping Burton never allows them to overpower the performances. Its all quite manic of course at least once Alice lands in Underland and the final battle isnt anything we havent seen in other films. But the sense of dark fun and adventure is unmistakably Burton who proves with ""Alice in Wonderland"" that he for one is in no danger of losing his muchness.

Hoberman Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland Tuesday March 2 2010 at 4 a.m. By J. Hoberman 1 Im not myself you see.Disney Enterprises Inc. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Walt Disney mulled an adaptation of Alice in Wonderland for decades before producing an animated feature in 1951 although by all accounts he didnt much care for the prim little protagonist let alone her supporting cast of ""weird characters."" One wonders what Uncle Walt would have made of his studios 21st-century 19-year-old Alice--a tousle-haired 3-D action figure who not only consorts with weirdos but decapitates a dragon and drinks a vial of the creatures glowing puce blood.The brain child of renegade Disney disciple Tim Burton--born in Burbank trained at CalArts employed by the studio as an animator--the new Alice is casually absurd off-handed in its violence and doggedly on message. The movie is not just three-dimensional but blatantly programmatic. As scripted by Linda Woolverton (whose previous credits include Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King) Alice is a straightforward allegory of female actualization.Indeed Alice (embodied by Australian actress Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland to escape her womanly fate--namely an engagement to a particularly bilious aristocratic twit. Shes a runaway bride (who has already refused to wear a corset) and much of what transpires in that moist warm realm down there (Wonderland is later called ""Underland"") demands to be read in specifically feminine terms.Upon arriving in Wonder/Underland Alice easily passes the eat-me/drink-me test growing markedly more relaxed as she accepts her bodily changes and adjusts her body image. Deflecting frequent attempts to challenge her identity Alice may be the healthiest protagonist of Burtons career--as well as the most conventionally attractive. Something that seems to have interested the director is the manner in which Alices outfits adjust to match her drastic physical alterations--the nubile girl is often in an unself-conscious but unmistakable state of dishabille until having gained possession of the sacred Vorpal sword she trades in her frocks for a suit of gender-effacing armor.Alice may be a babe but Eros is largely sublimated. Amid the digitally conjured white rabbits Cheshire cats and hookah-smoking caterpillars Alice does encounter a pair of flesh-and-blood males--but Johnny Depps amusing Mad Hatter his golden eyes matched by an orange fright wig is scarcely more eligible than Crispin Glovers thoroughly creepy Knave of Hearts. In any case Wonderland is a gynocracy and rather than romance Alice is drawn into the rivalry between two sisters Helena Bonham Carters irascible Red Queen (her CGI-created bulbous head accentuated by pursed bee-stung lips) contends for power in Wonderland with the languid girly White Queen (Anne Hathaway who needs little more than death-pallor pancake and near-black lipstick to seem equally freakish).Presiding over a theme park of total design waited on by a frog footman and terrorizing her deformed prosthetic-enhanced courtiers the Red Queen is by far the more amusing of the two siblings--as well as the more dangerous. This castrating mega-bitch not only unleashes the monstrous Jabberwock on Alice but her own competitive jealousy (""Arrest that girl for unlawful seduction"" she screams after her consort Knave makes an ill-advised pass at the temporarily plus-sized Alice). Of course as passive and narcissistic as she is the White Queen is hardly a suitable role model for Alice either. The sister is going to have to do it for herself--and she does regularly insisting that Wonderland is actually her dream.Lewis Carrolls literal-minded little Alice was something of a logician; Burtons is comfortable with adult irrationality although shes hardly a hippie chick; neither is his Alice sad to report in the least bit lysergic. On the contrary the movie is positively sober in its positive image projection and concern with itself as a business model. Like more than one recent movie Alice seems a trailer for a Wonderland computer game--and it is. The final battle is clearly designed for gaming. So it would seem is the character of actualized as well as action Alice. It turns out that back in the U.K. Alice even has a plan that involves expanding her jilted father-in-laws enterprise to China. Walts corporate heirs must be proud.On the other hand Mouse Factory imagineers may be less taken with Alices 3-D which is far less spectacular than that in either Avatar or Robert Zemeckiss punishing Christmas Carol. Perhaps as a cost-cutting measure Alice was shot normally and stereofied in post-production. The resulting 3-D is shallow and largely superfluous Alice falling down the rabbit hole toward the camera is the big deep-space effect although the caterpillars exhaled smoke is a niftier one and Burton makes the relative flatness work for him by giving Alices engagement party the quality of a paper-doll pop-up book.Indeed better three-dimensional Burton can be found at the Museum of Modern Art. As organized by Ron Magliozzi and Jenny He the ferociously popular Burton show now in its fourth month is less a retrospective than a cabinet of curiosities. One enters as if into a funhouse through some creatures mouth and down a long corridor past a wall of Stain Boy animations which functions as a sort of carnival midway at least on the afternoon I fought my way into the show when it was populated by a dazed crowd of dour dweebs serious goth girls stroller babies and Japanese tour groups. The sound of Danny Elfmans sepulchral hurdy-gurdy emanates from a darkened gallery where surrounded by black-light paintings a miniature carousel floats above a lightning globe drawing one further into a suite crammed with Burton critters Oogie Boogie the cute lil Martian from Mars Attacks a larger-than-life Jack Skellington some fake heads from Beetlejuice a cookie-making robot from Edward Scissorhands and an assortment of unnamed spindly bug-eyed things some called ""Tragic Toys for Girls and Boys.""Burtons spidery sketches may be minor but critical mass gives them heft. Basically the show is an assemblage of maquettes props paintings and motion tests. The installation is dense and the juxtapositions are often witty (Ed Woods angora sweater next to Cat Womans polyurethane jumpsuit and the Penguins black wicker baby carriage). Theres even one of Edward Scissorhandss topiary animals out in the Museums sculpture garden. The ""Dream of Venus"" pavilion that Salvador Dali designed for the 1939 New York Worlds Fair might provide an art world analogue for the show but Burton is heir to another tradition--the first filmmaker since Disney who could orchestrate a theme park. If our mayor wanted to give the city a gift (and himself a monument) he could do a lot worse than commissioning Burton to redesign Coney Island.jhobermanvillagevoice.com Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact J.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Welcome to the Fun House Tim Burtons Alice isnt quite Lewis Carrolls but it has its own delightfully garish soul. _ By David Edelstein Published Mar 1 2010 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Disney Enterprises) To dispense with the obvious Tim Burtons new Disney movie is not Lewis Carrolls masterpiece of dream illogic Alices Adventures in Wonderland but more of a C. S. Lewis Carroll Alice in Narnia with your horror host Johnny Depp. In Burtons Alice in Wonderland characters tropes and actual verses of Alices Adventures and its sequel Through the Looking-Glass are folded into an action-fantasy in which the 19-year-old Alice (in her second plunge down the rabbit hole) must prove her mettle by rising up on the frabjous day and slaying the Jabberwock (Callooh Callay) thereby saving Underland (allegedly the subterranean kingdoms real name) from the nasty Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). The Reverend Charles Dodgsons deliciously maddening satire of English manners and pedantry is now fodder for noisy chases thwacking battles with CGI beasties and a smug framing story in which Alice (Mia Wasikowska) must decide at a garden party before sundry members of the aristocracy whether to accept an offer of marriage from a profoundly unattractive prig or follow in the madcap footsteps of her late father. If you can get past the craven concessions to formula though its rather underfulI mean wonderful. Taking his cues from John Tenniels famous illustrations Burton indulges his delight in disproportion. Nothing and no one in Underland quite fits least of all our heroine who becomes very small then very big then teensy enough to hide inside the Mad Hatters hat then vastly out of scale with the court of the Red Queen where shes greeted as a visiting giantess. (Alice wears variously a dress a dress fashioned from her underwear some curtains and finally a suit of snazzy silvery Joan of Arc body armor for riding into battle on the frumious Bandersnatch.) After standing in long lines at MoMA for fleeting glimpses of his adolescent doodles I swore not to succumb to mindless Burton worship. But its hard to be undazzled by the way he mingles the circus and the sepulchre the Magic Kingdom and the mausoleum For Timmy Scissorhands there is no true beauty without a touch (or a ton) of decay. He also lives to turn actors into funhouse-mirror versions of themselves. As the homicidally petulant Red Queen (who is more like the first books Queen of Hearts) Burton ghoul-friend Bonham Carter sports a double-size head atop a normal-size body suggesting an enormous overdressed infant. The Queens chief henchman the Knave of Hearts is Crispin Glovers noggin on a spindly elongated framevery whats-wrong-with-this-picture and yet given Glovers spidery presence very right. The immense bald neckless blobs with the head(s) of actor Matt Lucas are a Tweedledee and Tweedledum dwarfed only by the more immense mushrooms springing up all over the moldy Underland landscape. Its disappointing when Anne Hathaways White Queen turns out to have normal proportions though her pallor is unearthly and her red lips rimmed in black. As Melville suggested whiteness might be the true color of death. Depp reportedly decided that the mercury poisoning that made many nineteenth-century hatters so mad would be manifest in his eyes (green) and hair (Bozo orange) and that his skin tone and accent would shift according to the characters mood. (I always saw the Hatter as kind of tragic ) Does it all come together? Not entirely but Depp brings an infectious summer-stock zest to everything he does I picture him digging through trunks of old costumes and trying on this torn vest and that dusty cravat and sitting in front of his dressing-room mirror playing with makeup and bulging his eyes and sticking out his tongue The CGI might have cramped his invention though. I wonder if Burton thinks back fondly on the days when Michael Keaton could rage around the set for hours coming up with his Beetlejuice riffs without worrying about Players to Be Computer-Generated Later. The fully CG-ed characters (the Cheshire Cat the White Rabbit etc.) are not particularly memorable (even with the voices of Alan Rickman Michael Sheen Stephen Fry and other high-priced Brits) which suggests that Burton for all his graphic genius responds most fully to flesh-and-blood performers. Alice in Wonderland is (in many theaters) in 3-D but Burton doesnt seem the least bit interested in Avatar-like immersion. The faker the better. The topiary and hedges create orderly layers of space and the foreground figures often resemble cardboard cutoutswhich strikes me as exactly how it should be given the characters playing-cards origins. The meeting of Red and White Queens on a great chessboard battlefield is gorgeousand the clash that follows is choreographed and designed with such wit and elegance that it puts to shame the longer more elaborate battles in other recent fantasy films (among themdare I say?The Lord of the Rings trilogy). Bonham Carters bratty insouciance will impress you more if you havent seen its obvious antecedent Miranda Richardsons peerless Elizabeth I in Blackadder II (Whos Queen?) but its still screamingly funny. And Burton made the right call in casting Mia Wasikowska instead of a swan-necked Keira Knightley type. The part of Alice is compromised by what showbiz people would call her new character arc but Wasikowska as she proved on the HBO show In Treatment can seem at one moment overdefended and the next poetically transparent.

""Youve lost your muchness"" Johnny Depps Mad Hatter remarks to his newly shrunken teenage friend and much the same could be said of Tim Burton in the wake of his encounter with a Victorian-era heroine of imaginative powers even wilder than his own. Quite like what one would expect from such a match of filmmaker and material and also something less this ""Alice in Wonderland"" has its moments of delight humor and bedazzlement. But it also becomes more ordinary as it goes along building to a generic battle climax similar to any number of others in CGI-heavy movies of the past few years. A humongous Disney promo effort and inevitable curiosity about the first post-""Avatar"" 3D extravaganza will pull wondrous early B.O. numbers although long-term forecast could become clouded by the imminent arrival of further high-profile kid-friendly features. It all seemed like such a natural fit -- Burton and Lewis Carroll Depp as the key component in fictions most eccentric tea party and 3D put at the service of a story offering unlimited visual possibilities. Not that its gone all wrong; not entirely. But for all its clever design beguiling creatures and witty actors the picture feels far more conventional than it should; its a Disney film illustrated by Burton rather than a Burton film that happens to be released by Disney. Although it draws heavily upon both Carrolls ""Alices Adventures in Wonderland"" (published in 1865) and ""Through the Looking Glass"" (1871) the script by Linda Woolverton (a Disney standard-bearer with a major hand in ""Beauty and the Beast"" ""The Lion King"" and ""Mulan"") crucially skews the material by advancing the leading ladys age from pre-pubescence to 19. The main upshot of the change is that this trip to Underland as its referred to here becomes Alices second not first. The not-inconsiderable benefit is that enables Alice to be played by Mia Wasikowska an actress of willowy Gwyneth Paltrowesque beauty but more important here of a pale but powerful resolve that confers upon the picture any gravity it may possess. After an over-the-rooftops cinematic entry into London that could as easily have alighted at the residence of Sweeney Todd (or for that matter Ebenezer Scrooge) a delirious little Alice awakens from yet another nightmare to ask her father ""Do you think Ive gone round the bend?"" To which he offers the encouraging tone-setting reply ""All the best people are."" Thirteen years later in an amusing framing story invented by Woolverton a pale sulky Alice is put up for an arranged marriage by her widowed mother (the enchantingly mordant Lindsay Duncan) with the twitty son of an aristocratic family. The lavish would-be engagement party quickly and appealingly establishes Alice as an impudent contrarian with a mind of her own; when in front of hundreds of elegant guests she is meant to accept the fatuous lads proposal she cries out ""I think I need a moment"" and promptly follows a white rabbit down a hole. Just as at such a transformative interlude ""The Wizard of Oz"" switched from black-and-white to color this should have marked the point when ""Please Put on 3D Glasses"" flashed onscreen and everything took on an all-consuming eye-popping look (the 3D in the garden party sequence is actually banal even poorly judged). In fact Alice enters a verdant overgrown world that undeniably resembles ""Avatars"" Pandora and encounters at least one creature a skeptical caterpillar that actually is blue. As things get ""curiouser and curiouser"" she also meets the round argumentative twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum; the vaporous and grinning Cheshire Cat; the manic March Hare; Depps Mad Hatter with saucer eyes Bozo-like red hair and gap teeth that bring Madonna to mind; and inevitably the fearsome Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who spares Alice from her favorite edict -- ""Off with their heads"" -- because she like all the others needs to know if this is ""the"" Alice who visited so many years before. Script arguably needed a narrative backbone of a sort not to be found in the episodic books and Woolverton has obliged. Unfortunately its one that turns ""Alice"" into a formulaic piece of work which Carrolls creation was anything but. Climactic action setpiece with an unlikely young warrior taking on a fearsome beast while gobs of CGI soldiers clash smacks of ""The Lord of the Rings"" ""Harry Potter"" ""The Golden Compass"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and any number of other such recent ventures. Thus does ""Alice"" become normalized a tilt Burton is surprisingly incapable of opposing. A jaw-dropping coda pivots on a ""visionary"" characters forthcoming voyage to open up trade with China provoking musings about Disneys rationale for this sort of corporate encomium to a vast young market as well as thoughts of a never-to-be-made sequel set among 19th-century Chinese as inscrutable and combative as the population of Underland. To be sure the design effects makeup and technical work is of a high order. Other than Alice the most memorable characters are the wonderful hunting dog Bayard and the elusive Cheshire Cat superbly voiced by Timothy Spall and Stephen Fry respectively. Among thesps whose faces can be discerned Bonham Carter authoritatively takes dudgeon to a new high as the Red Queen. Unfortunately Anne Hathaway is miscast as her sister the White Queen as her white hair and black eyebrows look weird and shes not temperamentally suited to the roles benign superciliousness. And Depp is Depp slip-siding among moods accents looks rhythms and keys like a jazz player on his own wavelength to disarming if transient effect.
