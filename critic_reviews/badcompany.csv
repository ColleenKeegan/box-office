Comments Bad Company Chess-hustling ticket-scalping Chris Rock learns that his separated-at-birth twin brother was an ultrasophisticated CIA operative killed while on a sensitive mission. Now the CIA wants him to impersonate his twin and retrieve a suitcase-sized nuclear weapon. Anthony Hopkins is the unsmiling world-weary spymaster who must train Rock and keep him alive. As in all Jerry Bruckheimer-produced summer blockbusters the premise is paper-thin and the action sequences play out with assembly-line regularity. Assassins chase Rock through an apartment building firing machine guns all over. Then Rock and Hopkins take part in a wild car chase. Then theyre surrounded by eastern European baddies wielding more machine guns. And on and on. Director Joel Schumacher does a fair job of managing the chaos but after a while you get tired of being dragged from setup to setup. 111 min.

Its almost impossible to enjoy this uneven but mostly exciting popcorn pic without flinching at a few plot elements that feel a bit too real for comfort. Setting the worst example of bad timing since ""Getting Straight"" a lightweight 1970 campus protest comedy opened within days of the infamous Kent State killings ""Bad Company"" arrives one week after ""The Sum of All Fears"" another glossy entertainment that pivots on the possibility of nuclear terrorism and at a time when some U.S. government officials are broadly hinting that such nightmare scenarios are possible maybe inevitable. Already pushed back from a fall 2001 release to gain distance from the real-life horrors of 9/11 this rapid-fire cloak-and-dagger comedy-drama may still strike many ticketbuyers as the wrong film at the wrong time. Unfortunately its almost impossible to enjoy this uneven but mostly exciting popcorn pic without flinching at a few plot elements that feel a bit too real for comfort. It will say a lot about the drawing power of top-billed Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock if ""Bad Company"" does indeed transcend its quease-inducing moments and achieve the mid-range hit status it likely would have managed a year or so ago. Pic is a typically hard-charging Jerry Bruckheimer production complete with name actors thunderous musical score lots of high-tech machinery and an abundance of moodily lit bluish-gray interiors. But word of mouth may have more effect on B.O. prospects than hard-sell advertising of seemingly sure-fire action-comedy ingredients. Jumping back into the saddle as a frankly commercial helmer-for-hire after recent dalliances in the semi-indie area director Joel Schumacher keeps things aptly fast and furious. Auds expecting wall-to-wall Rock yocks may be mildly surprised by deadly serious opening scenes in Prague as CIA spook Gaylord Oakes (Hopkins) and top operative Kevin Pope (Rock) dicker with Adrik Vass (Peter Stormare) a Russian black-marketer. They offer Vass 1 million toward a suitcase-sized nuclear weapon. Unfortunately theres a rival bidder. One thing leads to another and Pope is fatally wounded while saving Oakes life during an ambush. Flash forward to the funny stuff Rock reappears as Jake Hayes a motor-mouth New York sharpie who earns small change as a chess hustler and ticket scalper. Jake doesnt know he had a long-lost separated-at-birth twin brother. But Oakes and his underlings appear and use smooth talk and big bucks to coax Jake into posing as his sibling just long enough to complete the Prague deal 10 days hence. Jake reluctantly agrees primarily to impress his nursing student girlfriend Julie (Kerry Washington). This cues a predictable but modestly amusing training sequence as the streetwise Jake is drilled in ways to pass himself off as his late brother. Midway through the Manhattan training the rival bidder -- Dragan Adjanic (Matthew Marsh) a ruthless psychopath from the former Yugoslavia -- sends another group of assassins after ""Kevin Pope"" leading to a slam-bang action set piece that is marred only by fleeting patches of confusion. Schumacher and editor Mark Goldblatt undermine their handiwork by occasionally failing to define clear lines of cause-and-effect activity. Even when things are slightly fuzzy however Hopkins maintains an appealingly jaded been-there/shot-that nonchalance as Oakes. In one inspired throwaway bit he doesnt even miss a lazy chew on his gum while pumping an extra round into a fallen assassin matter-of-factly making sure that the guy really is you know dead. At the same time however Hopkins persuasively conveys a sense of guilt for the death of Kevin Pope. Rock is a tad too broad -- and worse a bit too borderline-offensive caricature-like -- in scenes where Jake whines screams and otherwise expresses mortal fear while dodging bullets avoiding knives and maneuvering through high-speed auto chases. On the other hand Rock is solid when his character stands up for himself; his angry put-down of Oakes cold-blooded condescending superior is a bound-to-be-quoted instant classic. Better still Rock gains in stature and credibility during the final half-hour or so as ""Bad Company"" gradually sheds most of its comic relief to gain momentum for a seriously suspenseful climax. Trouble is the final scenes are likely to be most troublesome for auds aware of real-world potential for nuclear terrorism. The race against time is sharply edited briskly paced and genuinely nerve-racking stuff. Its also alas a lot for auds to swallow right now. Especially when Oakes sagely notes ""Youd be surprised what you can send by air freight."" As a odd-couple buddy-buddy action comedy ""Bad Company"" is a mixed bag. The comical bits often are so overplayed that they actually get in the way of the familiar but effective thriller elements. Indeed the most hilarious moments are those in which Hopkins and Rock play off against each other without raising their voices. As you might expect in a Bruckheimer-produced opus production values are ultra-slick. Of particular note is lenser Dariusz A. Wolskis exemplary lensing of well-chosen Prague locations. Also typical for a Bruckheimer A superior supporting cast. As Oakes most valuable cohorts Brooke Smith and Gabriel Macht make the absolute most of thinly written roles evidencing more than enough screen presence to make themselves memorable even amid the distracting sound and fury.

"Bad Company Bankrupt washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids On Screen Bad Company Bankrupt Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 7 2002 WATCHING ""Bad Company"" many ideas for different titles came to mind. Lets see there was ""Sad Company"" ""Bad Idea"" and ""Old Idea."" After all were talking about a reserved white CIA agent (Anthony Hopkins) who recruits a black streetwise hustler (Chris Rock) to fulfill a dangerous mission. When I held up the promotional picture of Rock and Hopkins without comment an office colleague groaned. ""Can someone please make them stop?"" he asked. During an undercover mission in Prague CIA agent Kevin Pope (Rock in a double role) is killed when he shields his colleague Gaylord Oakes (Hopkins) from gunfire. Oakes is ordered to complete the mission which involves buying a nuclear device from a European operator named Adrik Vas (Peter Stormare). Oakes needs a dead-ringer replacement for Pope. Thank goodness Pope had a twin brother named Jake Hayes. The brothers who were separated at birth never knew about each other. The CIA veteran tracks down Hayes whos a speed-chess-playing fast-talking dealmaker. And to cut a longwinded predictable scenario short Oakes trains Hayes to act like his lost brother -- but (under orders from the Company) doesnt fully reveal how much danger hes in. Of course Oakes becomes increasingly sympathetic toward Hayes as they get in deeper. Producer Jerry Bruckheimers best move of all was to hire Joel Schumacher to direct the picture. A pop-kitsch expert who has directed ""The Lost Boys"" two ""Batman"" movies and two John Grisham movies Schumacher gives this movie as good streamlined and fast-paced a ride as he can. But in the end the directors stuck with a stinker of a premise which returns to the now-cliched white-guy-black-guy era of ""Beverly Hills Cop"" ""Trading Places"" and ""48 HRS."" When those films came out in the 1980s all of them starring Eddie Murphy the Berlin Wall was still up. Now the walls down. Murphy has evolved into Doctor Dolittle. But ""Bad Company"" (which Bruckheimer first started conceiving in the late 1980s) is still asking us to chuckle at that nutty dynamic between ""urban"" wisecracking and chilly white deadpan. This movie should have been buried under all that Berlin rubble. BAD COMPANY (PG-13 117 minutes) -- Contains violence bad language sexual situations and straight-to-video formula. Area theaters.

"Bad Company Old Guys Rock washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Bad Company Old Guys Rock Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 7 2002 The news in ""Bad Company"" isnt that Chris Rock talks smack but that Anthony Hopkins kicks butt. Its as if the distinguished British actor has been so thoroughly creeped out by his own mythic perversity in the Hannibal-the-Cannibal films -- hes now making a third one ""Red Dragon"" -- that he decided to take a vacation in the wide-open spaces of an American action pic. There at age 64 he gets to do all those cool American things shoot or beat up bad guys; drive fancy cars fast in pursuit of or to get away from other fancy cars driven fast; cop an attitude toward a stupid supervisor; help save the world; and most important wear a baseball cap and chew a toothpick. If Sir Anthony is the new Arnold Schwarzenegger that information carries the higher truth that ""Bad Company"" is nine parts genre staple to one part Chris Rock comedy. Oh Rock is there all right if just barely but it seems that nobody involved with the making of ""Bad Company"" paid much attention to him. When it comes to delivering on the excellent premise of the trailers -- a brother from the streets gets down in the whiter-than-rice culture of the CIA -- the movie is a disappointment and Rock surely as amusing a comic presence as anybody working today is given short shrift. Meanwhile Sir Anthony of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts where he must have taken the famed RADA course ""Close-Quarters Battle Drill With the Submachine Gun"" is going to town. Brrrrrrrp quoth the acting sir with his tiny German wundergun followed by bapbapbap when he switches to pistols and thunk whap grunch when he smashes fists against various Slavic types in need of shaves and better agents. Those Brits So much versatility As the movie has it Hopkins is a jaded CIA case officer not so old that he doesnt occasionally go operational. He has been running the brilliant young agent Kevin Pope (Rock) through a complex scam in Prague aimed at procuring a stolen suitcase nuke from an ex-KGB goon (Peter Stormare who was so much better when he didnt talk in ""Fargo""). But a rival bidder for the bomb ambushes the CIA team and Kevin is killed. It turns out -- I hate it when this happens -- Kevin had an unknown twin brother raised in another family who must be recruited forcibly if necessary and trained within nine days. Jake Hayes (Rock again) is everything the slick Harvard-educated Kevin was not and nothing that he was. Hes got attitude moves sass and no interest in larger entities like the nation. He burns with furious resentment even as he shines with the gift of glib and he routinely six-move-checkmates his opponents in chess-for-cash games in the park. A small-time street hustler he sees no percentage in hustling for the Man especially when the opposition kills folks. You might look for a metaphorical social overlay Symbolically Jake is being weaned from black culture into the wider multicultural America. Hes learning to commit to the larger; hes learning that we are truly all in this together and sometimes you gotta do what the Man says particularly when the Man says hey keep a stolen nuke from going off in Grand Central Station. But its as if that theme scares the heretofore and forever-after lightweight director Joel Schumacher and he wants as little to do with it as possible. Or maybe its the influence of the blastmaster Jerry Bruckheimer who never produced a movie that didnt have at least leventy-lebin splosions in it. Whatever the movie is more a gunfest than a Rock concert. Though not great its actually a little better than the dim ""Sum of All Fears"" currently flattening Baltimore in theaters across the nation. That film with its shameless groveling before the altar of impetuous youth is really an age hustle. Old guys bad young guys good as a way of shaking money out of the pockets of young guys. But ""Bad Company"" -- totally unrelated by the way to either the British rock group or the 1972 western -- walks the other side of that street Its discreetly an endorsement of the cult of expertise. The old guy Hopkins knows what the hell hes doing and only in finally submitting to him does Rocks Jake become the Man himself. Thats a theme that was old when John Wayne was young and at its peak when John Wayne was old and here its unfurled in all its creaky glory. In some other respects the film sometimes falls down hard. Schumacher as he proved in his two ""Batman"" forays is not the worlds best action director so a few of the chases and fights (there are many) play flat; even when they dont theyre pretty routine. In fact the milieu is routine A lot of what goes on is sheer set dressing -- the movie is full of computer gizmos people talking into throat mikes hard-looking Kevlar-helmeted dudes with fancy black guns with scopes and a lot of techno-jargon most of it meaningless. Then theres the ending or rather the three endings as the film which checks in at almost two hours just keeps going on and on and on. And I think the filmmakers make a big mistake at the three-quarters mark when they blow away all the bad guys weve grown to hate and replace them with folks weve never seen before and dont really care about. But Anthony Hopkins with a toothpick and a slouch. Fabulous BAD COMPANY (PG-13 110 minutes) A? Contains sexual innuendo and extravagant but bloodless gunfights. At area theaters.

USATODAY.com - Rock Hopkins in very bad Company Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/07/2002 - Updated 0932 AM ET Rock Hopkins in very bad Company By Mike Clark USA TODAY Bad Company (out of four) Stars Anthony Hopkins Chris Rock Gabriel Macht Kerry Washington Director Joel Schumacher Distributor Touchstone Rating PG-13 for a sequence of violent action some sensuality and language Bad Company leaves a bad taste not only because of its bad-luck timing but also the staleness of its script. No one is clamoring for a trivial comedy partly about the nuclear terrorism of New York City -- especially one thats 117 minutes long and delayed from fall 2001. In fact who needs another Bad Company? This Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock teaming is the third major studio release with that title in 20 years. Lets hope Hopkins gouged the Touchstone tills for lending his presence. In a long dull prologue a polished CIA agent (Rock) is slain in Prague saving his bosss life (Hopkins) while theyre in negotiations to buy a nuclear bomb from a Russian black-marketer. Read more below Video View trailer for Bad Company But with the baddies unsure they have bumped off Rock Hopkins and the agency have an ace. Rock had a twin he never knew a street-smart ticket scalper. Of course Rock gets strong-armed into becoming a sibling sub and Hopkins has about three days to polish the guys rough spots. Yeah weve seen that before too. Shootouts ensue. The dead brothers squeeze shows up and is dumped by the script after she serves her purpose modeling scanty lingerie to dazzle the 14-year-old target audience. More shootouts an abduction and oh yes impending doom. At least Hopkins is in rare action mode during car chases that youve otherwise seen a million times as well. Anyone who pays to see this movie once Week 1 word gets around should be judged by the Company she -- but mostly he -- keeps. Even Rocks usually dependable diatribes arent good for much more than four or five yuks.

Starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock. Directed by Joel Schumacher. (PG-13. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its Friday which means the opening of another movie about terrorists getting hold of a stray nuclear bomb. The latest ""Bad Company"" finally arrives in theaters today after a six-month delay due to the Sept. 11 attacks. ""Bad Company"" is a combination buddy comedy/spy thriller with an oddly matched pair of buddies Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock teaming up to foil Russian blackmarketeers and Arab terrorists. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer (""Gone in 60 Seconds"" ""Con Air"") it has the usual Bruckheimer virtues and vices Its fast snappy and entertaining in a superficial way. But it lacks gravity and authenticity and seems more like a product than an attempt to tell a story. The best thing about the movie is Hopkins who is game enough to act as though hes in a serious picture. He chooses to play a veteran CIA agent Oakes with an almost impenetrable world-weariness. A cynic might say its just the weariness of an actor walking through a bad script but theres nothing phoned in about the performance. He looks like he has seen so many horrors that hes beyond grief or happiness. Chris Rock doesnt fare nearly as well partly because he looks uncomfortable half the time but mainly because he has the scripts weakest lines. Rock is much wittier than the fellow hes playing a street hustler named Jake who makes his living scalping tickets and playing speed chess. Hes recruited into the CIA when his identical twin brother -- separated at birth -- is killed while in the process of putting together an international deal for the agency. So there we have it ""Pretty Woman"" meets ""My Fair Lady"" meets ""Spy Games."" Jake has to be transformed from a young wise guy into a polished spy in a matter of days. He has to do it well enough to fool the Russians so the CIA can buy the bomb and dispose of it. And in the meantime he has to avoid Arab assassins who want to kill him so that they can buy the bomb themselves. Jakes transformation should have been the heart of the movie but we see very little of that process beyond his complaining about having to get up early. Hes not motivated so the character doesnt grow. All we get are flat wisecracks or when things get dangerous scenes of him freaking out with terror. This for two hours. The movie is peppered with chase scenes and attempted assassinations. One assassin actually gets close to Jake but fortunately turns out to be a special assassin who only uses a knife and makes it a practice to alert victims by yelling ""Arhhhhhh"" as he charges them. Much of the spy story makes no sense at all. For example Oakes and Jake go to buy the bomb and spend an inordinate amount of time downloading the launching codes. Why? They have the bomb in their possession and have no intention of detonating it. Also why are the terrorists after Jake and not Oakes? And why is Jake needed for the transaction anyway? The Russians could just as easily sell the bomb to Oakes alone. Movies dont have to be ""believable"" to be good. Plausibility despite what some critics might say is hardly a virtue. But when a movie accidentally crosses the line into just plain ridiculous it can be a problem especially when its dealing with a subject as serious as a nuclear nightmare. ""Bad Company"" crosses that line over and over until the experience stops feeling jolly and starts feeling vaguely insulting. Yet strangely  as weak as the movie is its always watchable. Still the other ""Bad Companys"" were better The 1931 one with Ricardo Cortez the 1972 one with Jeff Bridges and the 1995 one with Ellen Barkin. And lest we forget there was the band Bad Company who had that great single ""Cant Get Enough"" in 1974. Unless someone has a good reason its time to give that title a much-needed 50-year rest. - This film contains violence and sexual situations.

By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- ""Bad Company"" lives up to -- or perhaps down to -- its name. This film starring Anthony Hopkins and Chris Rock is your typical ""fish out of water"" story. Youve seen them a million times. Just one problem Fish out of water usually die. This one does. They also start to stink after a while. Ditto. Looking highly embarrassed (as well he should) Hopkins plays a veteran CIA operative named Oakes. Hes on a highly dangerous mission involving a nuclear suitcase bomb and a plan by terrorists to use it on American soil. But shortly after the opening credits his partner Kevin Pope (Rock) is murdered. Just when you think the film may now actually have a chance at working the powers that be at headquarters find Popes twin brother. A brother nobody ever knew he had. How amazingly convenient -- not to mention ludicrous. And what a bummer the characters also played by Rock. The streetwise semi-crooked brother Jake Hayes is now groomed to become a spy fool a band of sophisticated international weapons dealers and save the day.

At any rate director Joel Schumacher and producer Jerry Bruckheimer (speaking of odd couples) owe the gifted comedian big time for remaining shrewd even when undermined by the storys inherent stupidity Rock helps save the world literally from suitcase-bomb nuclear terrorism far too anxiety-provoking in the first place for comedy these days.
