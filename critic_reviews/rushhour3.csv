"Two tours of Paris sizzle fizzle | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesTwo tours of Paris sizzle fizzleThe coincidental release of two films about squabbling couples in Paris provides a case study in contrasting styles with the City of Lights as a most obliging setting.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Aug. 10 2007 (out of 4)Starring Jackie Chan Chris Tucker Max von Sydow Jingchu Zhang and Roman Polanski. Directed by Brett Ratner. 85 minutes. At major theatres. PG  Article Continued BelowStarring Julie Delpy Adam Goldberg Marie Pillet and Albert Delpy. Directed by Julie Delpy. 96 minutes. At the Cumberland.  The coincidental release of two films about squabbling couples in Paris provides a case study in contrasting styles with the City of Lights as a most obliging setting.Rush Hour 3 is a blockbuster sequel filmed with the enthusiasm of jury duty and as barren of novelty as a burned-out souvenir stand.2 Days in Paris is a rough gem made with passion and insight by Julie Delpy who wrote directed acted in and composed music for this bittersweet study of her hometown. Guess which film will do the most business? And which one deserves to be seen?When a franchise runs out of steam desperate filmmakers and their accountants often move the action across the Pond to make light of uppity Europeans.Such is case of the cash cow known as Rush Hour which surprisingly took six years between instalments. All that was amusing and vigorous about Rush Hour 2 also directed by Brett Ratner and scripted by Jeff Nathanson has been drained from this rote follow-up. Comic sparks between odd-couple cops Lee (Jackie Chan) and Carter (Chris Tucker) have been snuffed as the two travel from L.A. to Paris in pursuit of Chinese criminals. Sharp humour about the differences between Chinese and African-American cultures has devolved into hoary stereotypes about snooty French people. The French get off lightly though compared to the films regrettable depiction of Americans. Tucker pulls a gun on a French cabbie who complains about violent Yanks thus proving the point. But the cabbie secretly yearns to be American himself so he can ""know what its like to kill for no reason."" A greater problem is the lack of action fatal for a movie with ""rush"" in the title. Chan is now 54 no longer as nimble as he was even six years ago. His celebrated insistence on doing his own stunts now seems a case of stubborn denial.At least Chans character has a story to work with thin though it is. The Chinese Triad Lee hopes to bust is led by Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) his long-lost ""brother"" from the orphanage they were both raised in. Tuckers Carter on the other hand is reduced to uttering ""damn"" at every turn singing falsetto right up to the pain threshold and offending women.How odd that a movie this lame could also attract actors of the calibre of Max von Sydow and Roman Polanski both wasted in minor roles. Its worth noting that in the inevitable curtain call bloopers theres no joke about a Rush Hour 4 but rather a nostalgic jibe about Rush Hours 1 and 2. This Paris trip shows its time to bid the series adieu a fact Chan and Tucker seem to be acknowledging.Much more engaging not to mention realistic is the tour of Paris offered by Delpy the multiple talent who finds real humour in the foibles of her native Frenchmen and the people of her adopted America.In Richard Linklaters recent romance Before Sunset Delpy played the Parisian love interest of Ethan Hawkes visiting American. For her own 2 Days In Paris Delpy again sets herself as the local Frenchwoman attempting to show a visiting Yank a good time. The mood is comic but romance is in the air - along with cigarette smoke and shouted oaths and threats.Delpys photographer Marion is paired with Adam Goldbergs interior designer Jack. Theyve been a couple for two years not always happily. Theyre in Paris after a disastrous visit to Venice where Jack succumbed to food poisoning. Theyre hoping to recuperate before returning to New York but everything conspires against them. Marions mother and father (played by Delpys real-life parents the actors Marie Pillet and Albert Delpy) struggle to understand Jacks hypochondria and his aversion to simple lunch dishes such as stewed rabbits head.For his part Jack cant believe the number of Marions former lovers who come out of the woodwork each carrying a torch for their former amour.Delpy twists American and French attitudes with equal aplomb and shes not afraid to give Marion and Jack flaws she has an anger problem; hes a selfish whiner.Equal parts charming and obnoxious just like travel often is 2 Days in Paris is full of observations that ring of truth. Such as Marions definition of real affection the best Ive heard all year ""You love his sneezes more than anyone elses kisses.""

By Moira Macdonald       Seattle Times movie critic PREV of NEXT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS          Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker hit the streets of Paris in ""Rush Hour 3."" Even cool stunts like parachuting off the Eiffel Tower cant elevate this sequel above formulaic flick. Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Rush Hour 3"" starring Jackie Chan Chris Tucker Hiroyuki Sanada Youki Kudoh Zhang Jingchu Max von Sydow Yvan Attal. Directed by Brett Ratner from a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson.91 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequences of action violence sexual content nudity and language. Some movie franchises like the ""Harry Potter"" series grow and change before our eyes; some like Brett Ratners ""Rush Hour"" movies stay resolutely the same. You know that Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker will sing ""War What Is It Good For"" at some point; that Tucker will squawk out his lines in that patented falsetto; that Chan will climb walls and jump off buildings and look vaguely embarrassed; that the good guys will prevail; and that many scenes will take place in heavy traffic. And indeed all of this comes to pass in ""Rush Hour 3"" the latest installment in Ratners popular yet increasingly out-of-gas action/comedy franchise. Chinese Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) and LAPD detective James Carter (Tucker) again team up -- reluctantly on Lees part -- to battle a Chinese organized crime syndicate which has shot a Chinese ambassador in the U.S. and kidnapped his daughter (Zhang Jingchu). Starting in Los Angeles six years after the events of the previous film the action moves to Paris where Lee and Carter make their way through crowded streets exotic gentlemens clubs and of course the Eiffel Tower where the movies climactic action sequences take place. Chan and Tucker were an oddly inspired pairing the first time around -- one underacts one overacts and it all seems to balance out somehow -- and the new movie does contain a few funny moments. Visiting a martial-arts studio in L.A. Tucker gets caught up in a whos-on-first routine thats so ancient you can practically see the dust fly but it works. (First guy ""I am Yu."" Tucker ""Youre me?"" Another guy ""I am Mi."" Repeat almost endlessly.) In Paris Chan makes a nightclub entrance perched on a swing goofily reminiscent of Nicole Kidman in ""Moulin Rouge."" French actor Yvan Attal (""My Wife Is an Actress"") is a welcome presence as George a cabbie who initially says he hates Americans but quickly becomes caught up in Lee and Carters milieu. (""The guns the shooting -- now I understand what it means to be an American"" he says eyes shining.) An odd cameo by Roman Polanski as a French police inspector who gives Lee and Carter a less-than-warm welcome is less effective. But its the chemistry between Chan and Tucker that takes center stage and its just not fresh enough to sustain the film. They bicker they banter they perform some scary stunts (parachuting off the Eiffel Tower with a French flag is admittedly kind of cool) they encounter some scary women and they shoot people almost as if going through a checklist. For those who still enjoy the formula ""Rush Hour 3"" will suit fine; but heres a vote for letting Lee and Carter dance into the sunset having sung their last chorus.

This unlikely pairing of co-stars and genres succeeded twice before. Although the formula seems a tad tired its still more entertaining than most sequels to a sequel and adding a French connection - Lee and Carters latest investigation takes them to Paris - provides an excuse for spectacular shots of city landmarks to divert you from a plot that makes precious little sense. But then plot has never driven the ""Rush Hour"" franchise. It works primarily because of the chemistry between Chan and Tucker which is at its combustible best this time out. Chan plays Martin to Tuckers Lewis the suave straight man who wont crack a smile at his sidekicks outrageous antics. Tucker is loosey-goosey from the opening scene in which Carter causes cars to bump into each other because hes directing rush hour traffic while keeping the beat with music on his headphones. Meanwhile Chans inspector is all business sleekly turned out in designer suits. The inappropriateness of his getups for martial arts stunts adds another layer of offbeat humor. ""Rush Hour 3"" is at its most amusing as a pastiche of famous scenes from other movies lovingly knitted together by director Brett Ratner obviously a cinema nut. (Ratner also directed the other ""Rush Hours"" resulting in a continuity of mood goofy as it is.) Identifying some of these references will get you past the boring parts about the crime syndicate under scrutiny. The so-called triads - melodramatically described as the largest criminal organization in the world - attempt to assassinate a Chinese ambassador before he can expose them. Since Lee is supposed to be protecting the ambassador he and Carter get drawn into an international plot in the City of Light. Its no coincidence thats also where ""The Da Vinci Code"" is set since the extremes the triad goes to keep its membership secret is lifted wholesale from the hit novel and movie. Borrowing from ""The Godfather"" and the quintessential buddy flick ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is no surprise. But parodying Abbott and Costellos indelible ""Whos on First"" routine is unexpected and hilarious. Following a lead Lee and Carter burst into a Parisian martial arts school and demand to know the masters names which happen to be ""Yu"" and ""Mi."" Ratners bow to cinema includes casting fellow director Roman Polanski as an obsessively thorough French police inspector and Max von Sydow as head of the ominously named World Criminal Court. Its a bit eerie seeing von Sydow an Ingmar Bergman regular who famously played chess with Death in ""The Seventh Seal"" onscreen a week after the Swedish filmmakers death. Although von Sydow clearly is slumming he doesnt act as if he were. He brings a gravitas to his underwritten role that it scarcely deserves. Of course ""Rush Hour 3"" isnt likely to attract a large contingent of Bergman or Polanski fans. Audiences who come for the combination of action and humor wont be disappointed though. Tucker does his bit pretending to be a costume designer at a Folies Bergere-type review and persuading the dancers to disrobe for his eyes only. A chase atop the Eiffel Tower gives Chan a chance to show off his astonishing agility. For a few minutes this latest formulaic installment is transformed into a towering achievement. -- Advisory Mild violence sexual content and nudity. Rush Hour 3 Thriller spoof.

Friday August 10 2007 400 AM Rush Hour 3. Third in the action buddy series starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. Director Brett Ratner (130). PG-13 Violence language sexual content. Area theaters. It occurred to me while watching Brett Ratners infantile ""Rush Hour 3"" that stand-up comic Chris Tucker wouldnt have a movie career if it werent for the racial stereotype he exploits perpetuates and apparently loves to play. If the ""Rush Hour"" series ends (fingers crossed) Tucker may be out of the film business altogether. ""Rush Hours"" Detective James Carter is the only role he has had in the past nine years and his jiving and physical minstrelsy have only gotten more obnoxious. The ""Rush Hour"" series owes its success to Tuckers co-star Jackie Chan who without trying to be funny actually is funny. The Hong Kong action star is still doing his own stunts at 53 and has a natural likability that makes him a perfect sidekick for buddy movies. But Chan is best when paired with a stronger partner as he was with Owen Wilson in ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Shanghai Knights."" In ""Rush Hour 3"" you appreciate his physical agility and grace but are embarrassed for him when Tucker begins screaming for attention. When ""Rush Hour 3"" opens Carter is directing traffic at a Los Angeles intersection listening to his iPod and squeezing his crotch to the rhythm of the music while Chans Inspector Lee is accompanying a Chinese diplomat about to speak before the World Criminal Court. Carter and Lee are reunited during a chase that follows the diplomats murder and then reteamed they follow the assassin - Lees rogue brother (John Lone) - to Paris. The plot has something to do with a Triad conspiracy details of which are tattooed on the head of a French cabaret singer (Noemie Lenoir). Max von Sydow shows up now and then as a French official and Yvan Attal is a bumbling cab driver who wants to know what its like to be an American and kill people for no reason. Yes the culture clash here has shifted from the tired black/white banter in the first two ""Rush Hours"" to the already cliched tension between the French and the Americans. This may be the best-looking film in the series; certainly the Paris setting with a climactic battle among the girders of the Eiffel Tower keeps the visuals interesting. Better you buy a postcard.

Now just simmer down and give it up all you proprietary fans of graphic novelist Neil Gaiman and surrender to cruel reality. With the release of ""The Princess Bride""-flavored ""Stardust"" the immensely winning and visually arresting adaptation of Gaimans 1998 fantasy the word is going to be out. ENLARGE Tristan (Charlie Cox) is a sweet diffident young man who as an infant was delivered to his father in a basket. (The lads true identity will come as a surprise only to those unfamiliar with the works of the Brothers Grimm Hans Christian Andersen or Walt Disney). Desperately in love with the indifferent Victoria (Sienna Miller) the prettiest and perhaps shallowest girl in their serene Victorian English village Tristan strikes a bargain If as a birthday gift he brings her the star that has just fallen Victoria will be his bride. To seal the deal Tristan must venture into Stormhold the enchanted kingdom just beyond the stone wall bordering his village. The bright particular fallen star hes after turns out to be embodied by a beautiful if rather petulant young woman who answers to Yvaine (Claire Danes channeling Gwyneth Paltrow). But this is a fallen star sought by many. The list includes dim-witted power-crazed princes of the realm and witches chief among them Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer here as in ""Hairspray"" wonderfully full of rage about her lost youth). One way or another the whole motley lot of them wants Yvaines heart. Those who like their fairy tales served up subversive -- or at the very least hip and self-referential like ""Shrek"" -- would do well to look elsewhere. The most ""Stardust"" supplies in this department is a hilarious Greek chorus made up of fallen heirs to the Stormhold throne and Robert De Niro as the fierce captain of a flying pirate ship whos leading a double life. With that armoire full of frocks and furbelows hes as much swish-buckling as swashbuckling. The considerable spell the movie casts is weakened by its length and sometimes scattershot approach. There are just a few too many incantations and transformations and the climactic scene is just this side of tedious. But these are quibbles. At its best ""Stardust"" shines bright. Rush Hour 3 Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker have been through a lot together. To be exact ""Rush Hour"" ""Rush Hour 2"" and now ""Rush Hour 3."" Are they tired? Perhaps not but their antics and action sequences certainly are. Like most other cop buddy movies the formulaic ""Rush Hour"" is built on the belief that opposites attract -- specifically that opposites attract audiences. Mr. Chan as Inspector Lee is the certified introvert the unflappable analytical half of the duo who lets his dazzling martial arts work do the talking. Meanwhile Mr. Tuckers officer James Carter is loud lewd bold and bumptious in his approach to the ladies and almost as bumbling as his fellow guardian of the law Inspector Clouseau. In ""Rush Hour 3"" as in ""Rush Hour 2"" Lee and Carter are up against Triad the pre-eminent crime syndicate in China one of whose members is Lees close childhood friend (Hiroyuki Sanada). To put a lid on murder and mayhem the two guardians of law and order must locate a mysterious list containing the names of the groups top thugs. The search involves a trip to Paris with stops at such tourist attractions as the Eiffel Tower the sewers a casino/house of ill repute and a cabaret styled on the Folies-Bergere where amusingly Messrs. Tucker and Chan cross cadenzas on the Roberta Flack-Donny Hathaway classic ""The Closer I Get to You."" Or perhaps it only seems amusing in comparison to a stop at a martial-arts school where the men offer up an offensive take on Abbot and Costellos classic ""Whos on First"" routine. Max von Sydow is on hand to play an eminence gris the sort of role reflexively handed over to Christopher Plummer. Perhaps hell turn up in ""Rush Hour 4."" Becoming Jane There is what amounts to a cottage industry of novelists who update or refashion the works of Jane Austen. ""The Jane Austen Book Club"" ""Jane Austen in Scarsdale"" ""Jane Austen in Boca"" ""Confessions of a Jane Austen Addict"" and ""Lost in Austen Create Your Own Jane Austen Adventure"" are but a few such titles. ENLARGE Anne Hathaway (shown here with James McAvoy left and Laurence Fox) plays the young Jane Austen in ""Becoming Jane."" Reimagining the life of Austen herself was perhaps the next logical step. Thus the heavy-handed fatuous ""Becoming Jane"" with the lovely Anne Hathaway doing the best she can in the title role. A letter from Austen to her sister mentions ""a gentlemanlike good-looking pleasant young man"" one Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy). According to Austen biographers he and Jane danced together at several balls flirted discussed the racy novel ""Tom Jones"" and perhaps even did a bit of canoodling. But Jane the daughter of an impecunious country rector had no dowry; Lefroy a prospective lawyer was expected to contribute to the support of his many siblings. Marriage then was an impossibility. Despite pangs the two parted. Jane never married. End of story. With plenty of Masterpiece Theatre filigree -- the wall-to-wall chamber music the bosky scenery the images of characters reflected in pretty ponds -- ""Becoming Jane"" takes that small undeniably tender interlude injects it with steroids (actually creates an elaborate fiction) and posits it as the defining event of the great novelists all-too-brief life. It surely could not have been the intention of the filmmakers to trivialize Austens art. But with myriad allusions to the novels -- the haughty neighborhood dowager (Maggie Smith looking like an aging madam) who recalls ""Pride and Prejudice""s Lady Catherine with one unsuitable suitor intoning ""Its a truth universally acknowledged..."" -- thats exactly what happens. Austen comes off here more as stenographer than writer. Worse the movie has Tom Lefroy as her condescending guide. If she wants to be a novelist she must learn about passion he says pointing her in the direction of ""Tom Jones."" Thank you kind sir.    DVD TIP Two sisters of vastly different temperaments (Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson) navigate the rough road to love and marriage in Ang Lees fetching take on Jane Austens ""Sense and Sensibility"" (1995) with Ms. Thompson pulling double duty as star and screenwriter. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation.

Related The Bourne Ultimatum A Macho FantasyThe Simpsons Bigger and BetterTravoltas Latest ComebackHarry Potter Grows Older and Darker Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME The masses have spoken third times the charm. The threequels of Spider-Man Shrek and Pirates of the Caribbean are the three top-grossing films of 2007. The Bourne Ultimatum opened to sensational business last week and promises to be the biggest moneymaker of the three Matt Damon spy thrillers. Now comes Rush Hour 3 with Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker reprising their roles as two detectives with clashing personalities and in previous installments a lock on the box office. The first movie was a surprise hit earning 141 million in North America and 244 million worldwide. The sequel upped the domestic take by 60% the worldwide gross by 42%. Simple arithmetic called for No. 3. And here it is. The difference is that the first Rush Hour from 1998 predated any of the other franchises by three years. Indeed Rush Hour 2 came out in 2001 -- the same year as the initial episodes of Spider-Man and Shrek a year before Bourne was born and two years before Johnny Depp muttered his first Yo-ho-ho. In the blockbuster biz six years is a long time -- nearly half the age of Rush Hour 3s target teen. Kids will need their older brothers to tell them the Chan-Tucker camaraderie was once worth paying to watch. And its not as if the two stars have burnished their luster. Tucker the falsetto funnyman whose career was launched with sharp supporting roles in Money Talks and Friday had made no non-Rush Hour films none in a decade. By some accounts Tucker is the worlds highest paid actor getting a reported 25 million for RH 3; yet he seems a star in seclusion from his own celebrity. Chan the sweet-souled masochist of Hong Kong action comedies made four Hollywood-based movies after Rush Hour 2 plus three starring roles in Hong Kong films but they didnt do much business and one Around the World in 80 Days cost 110 million to produce and took in far less than half that. After 53 years on this planet 30 as the hardest working star on any continent with virtually every bone in his body broken while performing his daredevil stunts Chan may have worn out not his welcome so much as himself. So its a pleasure to report that the new Rush Hour is... OK. Brett Ratner who directed the first two episodes (as well as the third X-Men and the Hannibal Lecter movie Red Dragon) isnt out to win an Oscar here; the movie is as lacking in visual elegance as it is in pretension. Its first reel or two sets a fairly low bar for the viewer so that when it perks up it exceeds expectations. The division of labor is the same as in the first two films Jackie kicks ass; Chris kicks sass. Ratners challenge and that of screenwriter Jeff Nathanson is giving the stars enough comedy byplay to keep audiences awake between the big action scenes and RH 3 gets it done. Of all the buddy movies this summer this one has the solidest chemistry. Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) has been assigned to guard the Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. against a death threat by Hong Kong triads. The ambassador is murdered by an assailant named Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) whom Lee tracks down but cant bring himself to kill because decades ago they were in the same orphanage. Detective Carter (Tucker) demoted to traffic cop hooks up with Lee and wheedles his way into a trip to Paris where an international dignitary (Max von Sydow) has given them the mission to hunt down the triad gang and its secret boss. Anyone whos seen von Sydow in Three Days of the Condor Majority Report or several other thrillers hes made on vacation from his great Ingmar Bergman films doesnt need me to finger Monsieur Big. It would be the movies biggest surprise if he werent the brains behind the triad. Local Parisian color is provided by some unusual suspects director Roman Polanski as a police inspector with a sideline in proctology; Noemie Lenoir as a chanteuse whom Carter has a dalliance with before suspecting that shes a female impersonator (""I went to second base with a man Its The Crying Games Im Brokeback Carter""); and actor-director Yvan Attal (My Wife Is an Actress) playing a cab driver who switches from anti-Americanism to pro-Hollywoodism once he becomes embroiled in one of the Lee-Carter chase scenes. ""Now I know what it is to be an American"" he says as he merrily dodges a car full of killers. ""Let me shoot someone."" (I didnt say the movie was subtle just that its easy to sit through.) Directors of summer action films know how to get a PG-13 show all the fighting you would in an R-rated film but dont show the toll it takes on the loser. Punches are fine but no closeups of broken jaws; throw a guy off a rooftop but dont show him landing impaled on an obelisk. Rush Hour 3 observes these niceties while twitting another MPAA rule no four-letter words. In an early scene where Carter is interrogating a French-speaking thug through an interpreter he gets exasperated and shouts ""You tell this piece of s-word that I will personally f-word him up."" Excellent solution. While Tucker keeps the comedy percolating Chan mans the action scenes the chase in L.A. of his old friend-nemesis Kenji; a bout of farcical fisticuffs with a like 9-ft.-tall martial artist; a wild ride in the taxicab; a decent hand-to-hand skirmish with a female ninja in a Paris casino; a swordfight with Kenji; and a two-against-the-world battle at the top of the Eiffel Tower. Chan has insisted he did his own stunts just like in the old days (so its odd to see that the Internet Movie Database lists one performer Zhang Peng as ""stunt double Jackie Chan""). He still moves plausibly through the mayhem which is what an action film requires. Maybe the climax here doesnt bear comparison with the jaw-droppingly great set pieces in Chans Dragons Forever or Drunken Master 2 -- or for that matter with Damons big fight scene in The Bourne Ultimatum -- but its way more frenetic and cunningly choreographed than the digitally enhanced brawls in most modern action movies. To put this in perspective the first Rush Hour was a pretty good movie the second one pretty lame. The threequel is somewhere in between nothing special but with a high amiability quotient. The two stars know they click; its no crime for them to extend and exploit that good vibe one more time. In the mandatory blooper bits that accompany the closing credits theres one where Tucker has just heard an angry Chan tell him theyre not brothers. ""Im not your brother?"" he squeals. ""After all that we been through? Rush Hour 1? Rush Hour Hour 2?"" That line alone justifies sitting through Rush Hour 3. I mean what do you want from a summer threequel anyway?

But Brett Ratners slipshod continent-hopping comedy reuniting crazylegs Jackie Chan with locomouth Chris Tucker elicits helpless laughter. By no means is it a great movie but it is great slapstick fun one of summers guilty pleasures. The first chapter of the franchise was set in Los Angeles where LAPD stuporcop Carter (Tucker) babysat Hong Kong supercop Lee (Chan). The second took place in Hong Kong where the kung fu king showed the kung foolish jester his turf. This time around - to hell with jurisdictions - the officers fly to Paris and investigate the attempted assassination of a Chinese diplomat for whom Lee once served as bodyguard. The prime suspects are Chinese triads. From a Godfather-esque hospital-room sequence to a set piece at the Eiffel Tower where gangsters and gangbusters tangle in the iron latticework the script by Jeff Nathanson is a catch-as-catch-can pastiche of Coppola and Hitchcock. Nathansons best invention a cabbie (Yvan Attal) who denounces America and its love of car chases guns and violence. And who after a few minutes in Carter and Lees vehicle-chasing gunplaying butt-kicking company is ready to apply for U.S. citizenship. Now 53 Chan is no longer the athlete and martial artist he once was. But he has a few sequences - including a foot chase through downtown L.A. up and across freeway ramps - that would take your breath away if you werent already gasping from laughter. Still Chan he of the polite deadpan has exquisite poise and timing that play nicely off Tuckers rude banter. The martial artist can almost always kick whirl or vault past any obstacle; the con artist can almost always talk his way past. They are opposites whose singular strengths make them unstoppable as a team. Ratner a hack who only the charitable would call workmanlike is the sloppiest of filmmakers editing scenes so abruptly or arbitrarily that the audience doesnt have time to laugh - let alone hear the next snatch of jokey dialogue. Working with the elegant cinematographer J. Michael Muro Ratner does a spectacularly crummy job in integrating Muros lustrous imagery with the special effects. Its as if a world-class chef had made a souffle and Ratner punctured it. While Rush Hour 2 boasted some strong female characters (played by Zhang Ziyi and Roselyn Sanchez) this time around the women are mostly decorative. The striking Noemie Lenoir plays Genevieve a scantily clad beauty who headlines a Folies Bergeres-type revue and who carries a dangerous secret. And the adorable Zhang Jingchu is on hand as Soo Yung the diplomats daughter who has little to do. Finally this is a buddy movie which means the only significant relationship is that between Carter and Lee who trade insults diet advice and gibes while watching each others backs. Vladimir Nabokov wasnt talking about Rush Hour when he observed that ""nothing is more exhilarating than philistine vulgarity"" but he might well have been.

Buckle up. By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor August 10 2007 Save for later Saved ""Rush Hour 3"" comes six years after ""Rush Hour 2."" At this rate Jackie Chan better think twice about doing a ""Rush Hour 4."" There are only so many pratfalls a 50-something guy can withstand.His costar Chris Tucker on the other hand hasnt made a movie since ""Rush Hour 2"" and yet his motor mouth is in fine working order.The yin-yang combo of these two stars has always been the heart of the franchise. They dont just look funny together they sound funny together. But a little of their East meets West Abbott and Costello routine goes a long way with me and in this third installment the shtick has worn thin. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Los Angeles Police Department detective Carter (Tucker) has been demoted to traffic cop and Chinese inspector Lee (Chan) is a bodyguard to the Chinese ambassador (Tzi Ma) first seen in ""Rush Hour."" The ambassador is shot in Los Angeles just before he is about to divulge the inner workings of the Chinese Triad crime syndicate to the World Criminal Court spurring Lee to chase the shooter on foot around the city. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Chan does a yeoman job of huffing and puffing his way through a series of amusingly daring calisthenic routines. But watching them I worried more about Chan than his character.The action soon shifts to Paris a move that seems calculated to both show off the city and take pot shots at the French. A cabdriver (Yves Attal) who scurries the two cops around is a Gallic cartoon who wears a Lakers cap and thinks all Americans like to kill for no reason. If this movie directed by series stalwart Brett Ratner wasnt so dunderheaded Id almost believe this guys love-hate for the US was meant as political commentary.Hes not the only Frenchman who gets trounced. In an unbilled cameo Roman Polanski plays a police chief who is only slightly less sadistic than the character he played in ""Chinatown."" This time the cruelty is meant to be funny. Quel dommage.While were on the subject of famous names of international cinema Max Von Sydow also turns up as the head of the World Criminal Court in one of those parts that great actors take on when they want to buy some beachfront property.Ratner who has been accurately dubbed a ""fauxteur"" does an OK job keeping the action swirling especially in the finale atop the Eiffel Tower. But theres no particular reason to have kept this franchise going except for commercial expediency. That may also be true of just about every other franchise movie this summer from ""Shrek"" to ""Bourne"" but the wheeziness factor here is particularly apparent. Grade B-Sex/nudity 7 instances including fleeting nudity. Violence 20 scenes of comic violence including fight scenes and an assassination. Profanity 40 strong expressions. Cigarettes/drugs/alcohol 2 scenes of alcohol 2 scenes of tobacco.

"Tucker Chan Still Provide a Rush washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Tucker Chan Still Provide a Rush The chemistry between Chris Tucker above and co-star Jackie Chan never stalls out in ""Rush Hour 3."" (By Glen Wilson -- New Line Cinema) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 10 2007 A critic is bound by honesty. So at the risk of eternal humiliation in the Internet stockade I must admit I laughed -- and was even touched by -- ""Rush Hour 3."" Its true. I could take the cowards refuge and claim that a steady summer diet of Sparrow Potter and Spidey has reduced my sensibilities to mush. So of course Id have fuzzy feelings for ""Rush Hour"" stars Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker who have built entire movies out of zippy quippy innocuousness. But theres more to this than judgmental burnout I think. Call it essence mining on the part of filmmakers Brett Ratner who directed all three ""Rush Hour"" flicks and Jeff Nathanson who scripted Nos. 2 and 3. They have isolated the franchises essential ingredient -- without which it could never have grossed 592 million worldwide. Its not Chans kung fu kicks or Buster Keaton-like stunts. Nor is it Tuckers bug eyes or helium-infused voice. Its the East vs. West tacky vs. subtle instinctive vs. disciplined and just-plain-crazy connection between two likable goofballs. Sure their adversarial relationship is just another variation on big screen odd couplings weve enjoyed from Butch and Sundance to Murtaugh and Riggs. But the sheer cultural spectacle of a histrionic African American trading jibes with a soft-spoken Chinese fireplug gives ""Rush Hour 3"" a subtext appreciated around the globe. ""You are not my brother"" Chan tells Tucker testily at one point without a trace of racial implication -- at least not in his head. But of course its that inference that makes us laugh and we can almost hear the harmonic cackles in Shanghai Dakar Milan and Sydney. After three movies together Chan and Tucker clearly have learned how to play off each other; theres an analogue truthfulness to their chemistry. When Detective James Carter (Tucker) interrogates an Asian hoodlum who -- absurdly -- speaks only French hes forced to enlist the help of a French-speaking nun. As Carter and the gangster trade insults through their nun interpreter the humor comes in the escalating absurdity. But its the appalled expression on the face of Chans Inspector Lee that really resonates. Which is why the ""Pink Panther""-esque story barely matters -- and trust me you dont want to know how our hapless heroes end up chasing Chinese triads in Paris or what on Earth Scandinavian icon Max von Sydow is doing anywhere near this production. Its also why we dont mind that Chan now 53 has restricted his physical work to shimmying down walls or sliding Ty Cobb-like under a rapidly closing entrance shutter. Or that 34-year-old Tucker is getting awfully long in the tooth to be playing essentially a human cartoon. As for that uh touching moment it happens when Lee and Carter have decided enoughs enough theyre parting ways forever. To the uber-cheesy Elton John song ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word"" Lee wistfully orders a room service delivery of sweet potato pie while Carter mopes forlornly at a sidewalk cafe munching Chinese carryout. Its a hilarious lampooning of that familiar moment in romantic comedies when both lovers think its splitsville and yet we suddenly realize how important their relationship really is -- to them and us. Rush Hour 3 (90 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for action violence sexual content nudity and profanity.

"Rush Hour 3 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; rush-hour-3 ) Rush Hour 3 (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its hard to think of a sadder commentary about Hollywoods sequel fetish than the existence of Rush Hour 3. Dull uninspired and redundant this third pointless movie in an action/comedy franchise that defines mediocrity doesnt even try to disguise the fact that its existence is a money-grab. I wasnt a fan of either previous Rush Hour film but neither felt as tired and obligatory as this one. Aside from some amusing scenes with Chris Tucker and a nice dA(c)jA  vu dance routine to ""War"" performed by Tucker and Jackie Chan this movie offers nothing that wasnt done better in the other outings featuring these mismatched buddy cops. The wafer-thin plot has Chief Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) protecting a Chinese diplomat during his stay in Los Angeles. He has top-secret information about the Triad crime syndicate but before he can divulge it he is shot. Lee reunited with his former partner Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) vows to the consuls daughter Soo Yung (Zhang Jingchu) that he will find the man who attacked her father. To do this Lee and Carter must pursue Triad assassin Kenji (Hiroyuki Sanada) to Paris where they are aided by an anti-American cab driver named George (Yvan Attal) who discovers that he has a taste for car chases and gunplay. As was true of Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2 this movie combines hit-and-miss comedy with lackluster action. The film doesnt have much of a pulse and the ""excitement"" comes across as pallid when compared to last weeks The Bourne Ultimatum (although at least the camera isnt afflicted with the shakes). This movie is probably no more amusing than its predecessors although its hard to be sure. Nothing in any of the Rush Hour products has been roll-on-the-floor funny and this one is no different. Especially lame is a riff on ""Whos on First"" that proves the stars of this movie have nothing on Abbot and Costello. Theres also a parody of emotional moments in buddy movies featuring Elton Johns ""Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word."" Maybe thats supposed to be an apology to the audience by Brett Ratner. Also consider a scene featuring a lot of raw sewage that may on some level be a comment about where the franchise is headed. On of the many areas in which the movie disappoints (although all things considered it isnt unexpected) its in the lack of physicality displayed by Jackie Chan. At age 53 he can no longer perform the kinds of stunts that made him an international star. Putting life and limb at risk in the line of duty are things for younger men. Most of Chans most daring work has been passed on to stunt-men and there are hints of CGI (although not to the point where its distracting). The end-credit outtakes which are typically a horror show of Chans muffed stunts are limited here to verbal bloopers messed-up lines and the occasional minor pratfall. Chans gift for comedy appears as muted as his martial arts derring-do. At no time during Rush Hour 3 is he especially funny. My assumption has been that as Chan aged he would gravitate more toward comedy but this isnt a good start. Chris Tucker picks up a nice paycheck but none of the slack. However while its a stretch to call him ""likable"" at least hes not as irritating as he was in Rush Hour and Rush Hour 2. Both Chan and Tucker are outmaneuvered in the comedy department by Yvan Attal whose characters love/hate relationship with American culture leads to some of the films wittiest (and I use that word loosely) scenes. Max von Sydow in ""concealed bad guy"" mode is on hand to do what he does best with that glorious bass voice. (Now that Bergman is officially in his grave he can turn over.) And Roman Polanksi has a cameo as a French policeman who anally rapes Lee and Carter. (Yes you read that correctly. A PG-13 movie features anal rape - although of course its only implied and is used to get a laugh.) Why Polanski would agree to play this part is anyones guess; its not the kind of thing that will help his less-than-sterling reputation. I kept waiting for Jean Reno to show up since he always seems on hand in these English-speaking films set in France. Does Rush Hour 3 deliver what audiences expect of it? Only its most devoted fans will say ""yes."" The formula is in place but the performers are going through the motions. Its a stale version of the previous movies and they werent all that great to begin with. One could argue that director Brett Ratner at least invested Rush Hour with some energy. Even during the climactic battle at the Eiffel Tower theres nothing resembling that here. This is just another disposable summer movie - so lackluster that its not even worth searching out when it plays on television. The Rush Hour experience which never attained anything resembling full speed has come to a crashing halt.

Watchers who warned that a six-year gap between installments would cost the ""Rush Hour"" franchise some energy -- especially from Jackie Chan now in his early 50s -- arent entirely off the mark. But the latest picture to feature one of the movies oddest crime-fighting tandems nevertheless stays true to the franchise formula of East-West fusion action broad cultural comedy and international intrigue this time largely in Paris. August rollout is like money in the bank for New Line which will milk this likely final installment for maximum revenues down the ancillary stream. Though late summer timing is just right for the franchise ""Rush Hour 3"" opens just a week after ""The Bourne Ultimatum"" and while auds may take some relief in the bouncy comic rapport between Chan and Chris Tucker theyre bound to find the action mild if not downright tame by comparison. The action bar has been raised to exceptional heights -- higher than even the great Chan can leap across. It may take younger viewers awhile to figure out the background plot in the new pic since screenwriter Jeff Nathanson (who also wrote the superior ""Rush Hour 2"") revives characters from the first ""Rush Hour"" Chinese Ambassador Han (Tzi Ma) and his now-20-year-old daughter Soo Yung (now played by Zhang Jingchu from ""Peacock"" and ""Seven Swords""). Han is shot by an assassin in Los Angeles just as hes ready to blow the cover on a secret triad conspiracy before the World Criminal Court. Carter (Tucker) has been demoted by the LAPD to mere traffic cop a job he executeswith his usual soul-hipster musical-comedy flair. As bodyguard to Han Lee chases the assassin across downtown Los Angeles freeway ramps and bridges (where Chan has a few minutes for impressive stunt work that doesnt involve hand-to-hand or foot-to-foot combat) only to discover the culprit is Kenji (the busy Hiroyuki Sanada) his long-lost companion and ""brother"" from their childhood orphanage. Emotionally unable to shoot Kenji Lee lets him get away. This sets up a potentially more interesting personal conflict for Lee than in ""Rush Hour 2"" in which his character had to confront his fathers ex-partner and murderer. Its not to be however The Lee-Kenji battle never goes beyond the emotional level of a stare-off. Carter and Lee hunt down an envelope with key info on the triad conspiracy. Until recently the evidence had been under Soo Yungs care at her kung fu studio in Chinatown (where the guys have a hilarious run-in with a giant dude played wordlessly by Sun Ming Ming who makes Yao Ming look like a runt). Triad henchmen now have the envelope but with a little bit of (witty) torture the duo determine the truth lies with Genevieve (the exotic Noemie Lenoir) the star attraction at an underground Paris nitery. The old black-Asian cultural parries between Lee and Carter have been retired; now in Paris its Americans vs. the French -hence characters like stuck-up taxi driver George (Yves Attal) whos so Americanized he dons a Lakers cap and thinks hes an international spy. Shift is a bit of a stretch but the Gallic friction is made more amusing by Roman Polanski (making a terrific uncredited cameo as Paris sadistic police chief) and the wonderful Julie Depardieu as Georges highly skeptical wife. Also involved in all this is World Criminal Court topper Reynard (Max Von Sydow) who may or may not be the upholder of global justice his title suggests. By the time Kenji phones Lee for a final confab at the Eiffel Tower two things will be obvious to attentive viewers Pic is following the always-compact ""Rush Hour"" formula down to wrapping things up in less than 90 minutes playing time; and Chan has far fewer stunt set pieces here than in any previous film in which hes starred. Jumps thrusts and falls across and down the Eiffel are quite impressive despite a few visible CGI effects and the capper stunt involving a giant French flag is just goofy enough. Still the pic ends rather flatly; the previous adrenaline rush just isnt there anymore. As if to compensate for an understandable diminution of physical prowess and martial artistry Chan moves more aggressively into purely comic territory offering a preview of his second career as a comedy star. By contrast Tuckers shtick is starting to feel long in the tooth and the thesp feels increasingly like a second fiddle. Sanada always a strong presence has an underwritten role that cheats the pic of several juicy action and psychodrama possibilities. Lenoir and Attal uphold their Gallic pride while Von Sydow plays the role Hollywood has regularly tagged to this supremely great actor The Elegant European. Helmer Ratner knows the ""Rush Hour"" routine by heart and production values even with several new contributors to the franchise (including solid lenser J. Michael Muro) maintain the franchises sharp shiny look. Rush Hour 3ProductionA New Line Cinema release and presentation of an Arthur Sarkissian and Roger Birnbaum production.
