Mel Gibson plays Nick Marshall a charming self centered lady killer who suffers a freak accident and is suddenly cursed - or is it blessed? - with the ability to hear womens thoughts. He saunters down the street or through the winding offices of the Chicago ad agency where hes the resident hotshot and each time he passes a member of the opposite sex he registers her inner voice - her hidden desires and resentments her diet woes and everything else hed never before had a clue about. When the job Nick has been coveting goes to Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) who has been chosen to lead his agency into the sizzling new era of female consumer power he brainstorms with her and steals her ideas and hes just clever enough about it to convince her that hes being a sexy gentleman as well. A chick flick tells women that they can be postfeminist adventurers and still land a man in an old fashioned fairy tale way. A gick flick does just the opposite It reassures men that they can live in the postfeminist world and even be domesticated without giving up their mythical ""freedom"" - their cherished ability to be randy charmers to be men. Gibson in a disarmingly nimble fast break performance makes Nicks new hyperempathy look like the essence of virile panache. He and Hunt achieve a genuine flirtatious chemistry though I suspect a lot of women are going to look at Hunts character and think that shes too nice and pliable. They had better get used to it. The new guy flicks built to feed the vanity of men are bound to be as reductive as all those Nora Ephron comedies that paved the way for them.

Publicity photo Image 3 of 3 Mel Gibson in ""What Women Want."" Publicity photo Mel Gibson in ""What Women Want."" Publicity photo Photo CHRONICLE Out of the Minds of Babes / Gibson becomes mind reader finds out What Women Want 1 / 3 Back to Gallery WHAT WOMEN WANT Comedy. Starring Mel Gibson Helen Hunt and Marisa Tomei. Directed by Nancy Meyers. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In ""What Women Want"" Mel Gibson slips on some bath beads and lands along with his hair dryer in a full tub. He wakes up the next morning privy to the thoughts of the fairer sex. He eventually realizes that he can exploit this curse to win fellow ad exec Helen Hunt and come up with winning campaigns that might make a woman want to empty her wallet. Meanwhile he gets psychically smacked around by the stuff sitting in womens brainpans until the thoughts wafting from their heads start to seem like cheap perfume. If you could bottle most of them the label would read ""Jean Nate."" Once you warm to the idea that the movie thinks this is cute Gibsons Nick Marshall seems dangerously charming and ""What Women Want"" turns into your garden-variety ""boy wins girl and new account at work"" chick flick. The girl is the aforementioned Hunt the account frightfully enough is Nike and the film was di- rected by Nancy Meyers who takes to the material like a strip-mall Nora Ephron. As a writer Meyers is the perpetrator of ""Baby Boom"" ""Father of the Bride"" and ""I Love Trouble."" Her style is best described as profoundly 1985 with updated materialist gloss. A corny belief in kismet curdles into a corporation-whipped cynical and creepy exercise in manipulation. Its all an encouragement to wonder whether women will now be scared away from having private thoughts for fear that ad men will hear them -- in the same way that 40 years ago they may have been afraid to steal 40000 check into a motel and take a shower. Of course ""What Women Want"" is savvy enough to understand that having Anthony Perkins stroll down the corridors of a womans mind would probably be different from having Gibson do it. Once his initial swagger is reduced to mush he disarms most of the movies offense -- the platitudes the galling close-ups the oppressive phoniness and Alan Alda as Gibson and Hunts opportunistic boss. But the better movie takes place while Nick is ""like a total bachelor and the least politically correct guy in the universe"" in the words of his ex-wife played by Lauren Holly. Meyers doesnt explain Nicks contempt for women as comedy per se but rather as a series of psychodramatic character shadings meant to be reversed two hours later. The accompanying back-story-cum-psychological profile reveals that Nick is the son of a Vegas showgirl. Of course how he wound up a chauvinist rather than someone dressed in chiffon and onstage at Caesars is a mystery better solved in a Nathan Lane vehicle. Perhaps to avoid an oedipal nightmare the movie shows Nicks flamboyant mother only in passing. Were to believe Sin City is to blame for his philandering as well as his unsubstantiated belief that the opposite of estrogen is Frank Sinatra. In early scenes Gibson suggests both a misogynist madman and a transvestite in waiting. But the movie is more ""Christmas Carol"" than ""American Psycho."" So Nick goes from sex god to just the best kisser in the world. The movie is top-heavy with women for him to practice being charming with. In addition to Hunt and Holly theres Delta Burke Valerie Perrine Bette Midler Loretta Divine Ana Gasteyer and best of all Marisa Tomei. Its so overstocked with barely used A-list or B-list women that it looks like a Hollywood storage facility for actresses. The movies gimmick for airing the contents of a womans head is not unlike that used for the dogs and tots in those ""Look Whos Talking"" movies. Gibson gets near a woman. We hear her talking to herself. Only Tomeis thoughts sound like actual thinking. She plays a coffee slinger/actress with no self-esteem who takes Gibson home for amazing sex and winds up obsessed. When she forces him to lie to her about why he never called you feel her humiliation. Shes been dropped because Gibsons found a best actress winner to lust after. Tomei only won best supporting actress. The movie might pretend to be about what all women want but its really more about Hunts ability to make a guy want to be a better man. She did it for Jack Nicholson and Kevin Spacey. Now its Gibsons turn. They each get a look at her and go weak in the knees. These guys see Deborah Kerr which is odd. When I look at Hunt I see a little girl who never grew into her smile. Still whether she can inspire a movie to be better remains to be seen.

(Paramount Pictures) I went into ""What Women Want"" with the same enthusiasm that I would a colonoscopy. But I have to say even though I am allergic to Nora Ephron-style pandering (I have a doctors note to prove it) the movies not as toxic as I expected. Fans of bubbly romances can consider this a thumbs up. I call it a clenched-teeth concession at best. Essentially ""Women"" is a men-from-Mars-women-from-Venus comedy starring the leading male Martian of the species Mel Gibson. As advertising executive and womanizer Nick Marshall hes all testosterone arrogant about his abilities in the office and the bedroom. He loves Sinatra. He doesnt drink wine he gulps it. Hes a mans man a cliche. Representing the Venusians is Helen Hunt. As Darcy Maguire shes unflappable (on the surface anyway) honest straightforward adorable and of course blond and pretty. Shes also the newest hire at Nicks firm. In fact she took the job that Nick wanted creative director. This makes her Nicks boss. War Her agenda to corner the market on womens products lipstick leg wax tights you name it. In other words Nick who makes manly ads full of nubile spread-eagled women is effectively a dinosaur. Theres a twist to this movie which was directed by Nancy Meyers by the way not Ephron. Nick suddenly acquires the ability to hear the thoughts of every woman. How does this happen? He accidentally zaps himself in the bathtub with a hair dryer. This occurs when he has taken some of these feminine products home - even slipped on the tights - to come up with an advertising scheme. How low man has fallen. But when Nick picks himself up from the shock hes catching thoughts from women all over Chicago. Suddenly he realizes what those women in the office really think of him. But he has a fantastic advantage in the war with Darcy. He can read the mind of his greatest rival the woman he wants to put out of business. Would it be too duuuh to mention they start falling in love? Clearly this movie amounts to a politically correct makeover for Nick whose teenage daughter Alex (Ashley Johnson) unexpectedly moves in with him while the ex (Lauren Holly) is out of town. Now hes got to shop with Alex for her prom dress and listen to her thoughts and horror of horrors be a good father. Writers Josh Goldsmith Cathy Yuspa and Diane Drake have created some rich situations that will appeal to Martians and Venusians in the audience including Nicks terrifying bout with a home-waxing kit and a brainstorming session at the firm which Darcy leads and Nick mind-reads. But this is an extremely long comedy at more than two hours. And they create some weird loose ends (which may be the fault of Meyers during the editing process for all I know). After we meet an uncredited and amusing Bette Midler as Nicks former marital counselor she vanishes for the rest of the movie. And Marisa Tomei plays a love interest for Nick who gets shafted big time by Nick and the screenplay. Shes just tossed out. Gibson despite that oily Im Mel baby presence and despite the fact that hes nothing but set-up Spam on a feminist plate does eventually win you over. So does Hunt even though shes doing the same trick she always does heightening that beauty with disarming charm. And when they do get together as we know they will its not the worst interplanetary coupling that ever happened. ""What Women Want"" (PG-13 127 minutes) - Contains obscenity sexual scenes and hideous destruction of male leg hair.

"What Women Want | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; what-women-want ) What Women Want (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli The key to enjoying What Women Want - a feather-light trifle that will probably find favor at the box office - is not considering the age-old question of what might have been. The underlying premise - a male chauvinist suddenly gaining access to womens thoughts - is so infinitely rich that it could have been used as the linchpin of a truly great motion picture. However the agenda set by director Nancy Meyers and screenwriters Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa is of a much less substantive nature. So rather than looking at What Women Want for what is isnt its most productive to view it for what it is - a romantic comedy that is as entertaining as it is inconsequential. Most of the credit for the films success has to be laid at the feet of Mel Gibson who exudes energy and oozes charm. Gibsons dynamic personality elevates the film - this is the most drive he has shown in several years. His co-star Helen Hunt seems content to remain largely in the background although during the course of her low-key performance she does a nice job of developing her character into the semblance of a rounded individual (keeping within the constraints of the script which is acutely aware of and therefore anchored by audience expectations). A nice level of romantic chemistry exists between Hunt and Gibson - certainly more than was evident in her recent endeavors in which she was paired with Richard Gere (Dr. T and the Women) and Kevin Spacey (Pay It Forward). What Women Want has a simple premise that it exploits to a point although not to the fullest. Nick Marshall (Gibson) is a ""mans man"" - the kind of politically incorrect charmer whom women fall for instantly. But theres a drawback to all of that machismo. Despite being the most accomplished ad man at Chicagos Sloane Curtis agency Nick is passed over for the job of Creative Director a position everyone in the office assumed he would get - everyone except the boss Dan Wanamaker (Alan Alda) who patiently explains that with the increase in female buying power Sloane Curtis needs someone who understands that ""its a womans world out there."" That person isnt Nick; its Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) the queen of female-driven marketing. And the moment she gets the job Nick is determined to unseat her at all costs. Then suddenly the King of Testosterone gets an unexpected infusion of estrogen. A home accident gives him the unlikely ability to hear what women are thinking. At first he believes its a curse but then a psychologist (Bette Midler in a cameo) convinces him that its a gift. So he begins to employ his powers for personal gain both in bed and at the office where he shamelessly pilfers Darcys ideas and passes them off as his own. But along the way two things start happening. First Nick begins to actually empathize with women. Secondly he develops feelings for Darcy. A fair amount of the comedy like the romance works. Some of the humor is pretty raunchy (almost too salty for a PG-13 rating) but there are enough solid laughs to make up for when things fall flat. One of the most memorable scenes has Nick in bed with a woman using his newly-discovered talent to assess and improve his ability as a lover. And of course many of jokes result from Nicks being privy to the dichotomy between what women say and what they think. When the film strays into dramatic territory its on less certain ground. However two of the secondary characters - a coffee serving girl named Lola (Marisa Tomei) and a suicidal messenger at Nicks office (played by Judy Greer) - are interesting enough to have warranted more screen time than they are accorded. Conversely Nicks relationship with his teenage daughter Alex (Ashley Johnson) could have been excised without losing much more than about 20 minutes of running time. The final scene doesnt work. Sure it accomplishes what its supposed to by tying everything into a tidy bundle and sending everyone home happy but there are some serious credibility issues. In addition theres a rushed feeling to the proceedings as if the filmmakers realized they had crossed over the two-hour mark and were in a hurry to end things lest viewers become restless. However because the ending wraps things up in a manner that fulfills expectations it doesnt detract substantially from the better material that comes before it. Director Nancy Meyers (who was involved with both of the Steve Martin Father of the Bride movies before directing The Parent Trap re-make) has fashioned cinematic cotton candy - all sugar and air. Her few attempts at making a pro-female empowerment statement are so feeble that they get lost in the storyline. Nevertheless she understands the essence of the formula and applies it in a manner that is infectious. A year from now movie-goers are unlikely to remember What Women Want with any degree of clarity but in an era of largely disposable and forgettable motion pictures there are far worse ways to spend a couple of hours.

A broad comedy about a mans man who evolves into a womans man ""What Women Want"" boasts an irresistible central conceit that more often than not is used for oafishly boisterous gags and squirm-inducing ""sensitive man"" wish fulfillment. With a manic Mel Gibson only now starring in his first romantic comedy playing an incorrigible seducer who temporarily becomes endowed with the ability to hear womens uncensored thoughts Nancy Meyers second directorial outing has sheer energy and audience allure to burn even if numerous speed bumps cause many of the comic possibilities to go tumbling overboard. Well-upholstered Paramount release is a near-perfect example of a film with heavy appeal to women that men will be willing to go along to as well a formula that spells heavy B.O. with the mainstream public everywhere. Usually cast in serious macho roles with the occasional soft streak (as in his most recent action epic ""The Patriot"") Gibson begins clearing a promising path for himself here as an unapologetic womanizer whos never willing to take no for an answer. Playing a man whos cocky irrepressible wild crazy and always hot to trot Gibson throws himself into even the most preposterous situations with such relish and abandon that the viewer like most of the women has little choice but to succumb to him despite the prankish nature of what hes required to play. As Robert De Niro has shown over the past couple of years theres a huge upside to developing ones comic potential and theres no question that Gibson (whose company after all produced the recent Three Stooges telepic) could go far in this direction as he graduates from straight leading man status. Amusingly introduced as the son of a Vegas showgirl who has always enjoyed the fawning attention of beautiful women Nick Marshall (Gibson) is now a hotshot Chicago ad exec with an ex-wife (Lauren Holly) whos marrying again and a 15-year-old daughter Alex (Ashley Johnson) whose top priority is losing her virginity. Fully expecting a promotion at work Nick is taken aback when his boss (Alan Alda) informs him that to help the firm target the all-important young female demographic hes instead hired the estimable Darcy Maguire (Helen Hunt) to put their shop back on top. Asked by Darcy to come up with suggestions for a new femme-slanted campaign Nick gets drunk in his penthouse apartment dances around and immerses himself in what its like to be a woman by waxing his legs polishing his nails and trying on pantyhose and a Wonder Bra -- only to be caught in flagrante so to speak by an aghast Alex and her b.f. Sequence is shameless to be sure but sets off gales of laughter due to the way it plays off of Gibsons ultra-macho image -- and simply because the star is so game. Episode concludes in the ""Twilight Zone""-ish bathroom accident that sets up the big gimmick in Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspas script To his initial dismay but eventual delight Nick finds ""I hear what women think."" The dismay as it turns out is pretty superficial taking the form of Nicks learning that there are actually some women out there who think hes a jerk. The delight of course is much more profound as a shrink (Bette Midler in an uncredited cameo) for some reason has to explain to him ""If you know what women want you can rule."" Before long Nick is putting his advantage to good use at the office throwing Darcy off-guard by telling her exactly what shes thinking before she has a chance to say it and by almost literally picking her brain for creative ideas that make him look like a genius. By this method he figures hell make sure that shes out on the street within a month. Nicks new-found insight and intuition have innumerable other benefits. Hes finally able to break down the resistance of vibrant coffee-shop girl Lola (Marisa Tomei) and entice her into a sexual tryst that goes way beyond what she could have imagined while he also becomes attentive to the plight of office wallflower Erin (Judy Greer) whose depressive suicidal tendencies would have gone unnoticed without Nicks clairvoyance. And then theres one of the films funniest gags in which Nick waits to discern the inner thoughts of his two zaftig assistants (Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine). Alex forced to stay at Nicks bachelor pad while Mom is away honeymooning is initially freaked out by her dads new and uncomfortable interest in her personal life although she doesnt object when he offers to take her shopping for a prom dress. Nicks makeover into the model sensitive male is also duly noted by Darcy who after all is one of those high-powered single professional women who knows how lonely it is at the top and needs someone to keep her warm in her lavish new apartment. At work Nick triumphs over Darcy but what an electric jolt giveth an electric jolt taketh away and when Nick loses his powers the film doesnt know what to do other than to come in for a very soft landing and putter to an indifferent stop. Meyers underlines boldfaces and italicizes every scene then applies a high-gloss finish so that no one in the audience could possibly miss a single line effect or intention. In storytelling terms pic gets off to a bumpy start clicks pretty nicely when Nick and Darcy begin to click in the middle stretch then falls off again. But Gibson seems all but inflated with helium throughout which contagiously lifts everyone else around him and Hunts more earthbound pragmatism plays well off of her co-stars buoyancy. Tomei shoots off some amusingly unpredictable sparks as a woman who finds Nick uniquely probing. Production designer Jon Hutman lavishes the settings with well-moneyed details that are appreciatively caught by Dean Cundeys silky lensing. Attractive Chicago locations are used to fine effect.
