The film follows a pot-growing threesome as they wage war against a Mexican drug cartel. Video courtesy of Universal Pictures. By Joe Morgenstern Updated July 5 2012 540 p.m. ET One of the two men in the menage a trois at the heart of Oliver Stones ""Savages"" wants to get out of the business of selling high-grade dope and into renewable energy. Hes already in it though. The movie renews the energy of depleted themes--drug violence drug wealth California dreaming Mexican cartels--and regenerates the career of Taylor Kitsch who gives the menage its strong ostensibly steely side. The violence is graphic the dialogue can be awfully arch and the style is often mannered but this long dense adventure takes surprising side trips into thoughtfulness ruefulness whimsy and romance. Its high-grade entertainment sustained by a buoyant spirit. ENLARGE Taylor Kitsch Blake Lively and Aaron Johnson in Savages. Universal Studios The trilateral love commission with its overtones of Butch Sundance and Etta (or for that matter Jules Jim and Catherine) is comprised of Mr. Kitschs Chon Aaron Johnsons Ben and Blake Livelys O as in Ophelia--""the bipolar basket case"" she explains helpfully ""who committed suicide in Hamlet. "" O further explains that Chon is cold metal Ben is warm wood and together they make one man. That contrast diminishes as time goes by; both men change in substantial ways. (The supercharged script was adapted by Shane Salerno Mr. Stone and Don Winslow from Mr. Winslows novel.) At the outset though Chon a Navy SEAL veteran of Iraq and Ben a Berkeley graduate with degrees in business and botany seem very much as O describes them. Partners in a Southern California enterprise that promotes--at least for them--better living through botany they grow and distribute weed of such legendary quality that a powerful cartel from south of the border offers big benefits in exchange for part of their product. Its an offer they cant refuse but they refuse it all the same a decision that changes the threesomes fate. While the savagery of ""Savages"" first emanates from the cartel the story tracks the increasingly desperate measures that Chon and Ben take to secure the safety of the woman they adore and to exact sweet revenge. After two flops not of his own making--""John Carter"" and ""Battleship""--Mr. Kitsch makes Chon a man of few words and deep feelings a knight of honor who reminded me of Russell Crowes Bud White in ""L.A. Confidential."" Mr. Johnson portrays Bens quirks and complexities with an admirable absence of comment--the glib idealism that has him touting the potential of a 10 solar panel in rural Africa the wimpiness that leads him to see the Mexican thugs as businessmen rather than the savages Chon sees. (The movie is tough on liberal optimism.) Ms. Livelys first task is to be as beautiful and seductive as O must be to keep her two guys hungry and happy; she is that and then much more when events test Os talents as a survivor. John Travolta is an American drug enforcement agent of fungible integrity; the actor plays the relatively small role with hardly a trace of the florid tropes he often favors. Benicio Del Toros Lado is a savage impure and simple who can make cutting a steak seem ominous; give him a nail gun and hed be as malign as Javier Bardems Chigurh in ""No Country for Old Men."" The movies great surprise and delight is Salma Hayeks Elena a svelte monster with a Cleopatra haircut who runs the cartel. Ms. Hayek gives a showstopper of a performance in a shrewdly conceived role not because her Elena is given to flashiness but because shes quick-witted scarily focused improbably droll and--the biggest surprise of all--capable of genuine human feeling. Thats evident in the movies best scene when Elena and O come face to face as captor and captive and O revealing a sweetly banal attitude toward life rambles on about her days at a community college and her charmed existence with Chon and Ben. ""Do Americans always talk like that?"" Elena asks when O finally subsides. ""Do you ever think about the future?"" Her questions arent meant to be hostile. Shes genuinely baffled by this golden child and touched by the motherly instincts that Os tenderness provokes. ""Savages"" which was shot by Dan Mindel is all over the place stylistically--its spirit is so inclusive as to welcome brightly lighted recollections of ""Beach Blanket Bingo."" And the runtime is too long by at least 10 of its 130 minutes. (A character played by Uma Thurman was reportedly excised.) Thats not a surprise in an Oliver Stone production Mr. Stones filmmaking energies have always resisted safe containment. But his direction is nicely loose when its not action-taut; theres a playfulness that seems to say What the hell lets let things take whatever course they need to take. Its an unlikely formula for success. The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone star in ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Watch a clip of the film. Video courtesy of Sony Pictures. A full appreciation of ""The Amazing Spider-Man""--theres plenty of fancy action to appreciate--requires not only a willing suspension of disbelief but a suspension of memory. The truly amazing thing is that most of what happens to Peter Parker in the first half of the film has already happened in previous chapters of the Spidey saga. Some differences exist to be sure. Peter is played by a different actor--Andrew Garfield instead of Tobey Maguire. Instead of being bitten by a single spider hes now munched on by several. But he gets the same lecture on responsibility from Uncle Ben goes through the same grief over Bens fate discovers the same superpowers in belabor-intensive ways invents the same uniform and mask. This hugely elaborate production is supposed to be the reboot of a foundering franchise but rebooting a computer wipes the silicon slate clean. In the movie whats old is old again. Whats new comes courtesy of technology. Spideys webslinging has been upgraded to spectacular laserlike marksmanship. The flying sequences in unexceptional 3-D have Spider-Man swooping swinging and soaring around midtown Manhattan with ever greater maneuverability. Yet even these blessings of the digital domain are mixed. Theyre oddly joyless demonstrations of hypergymnastics extravagant motion with meager emotion. ENLARGE Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man. Columbia Pictures At one point in fact the movie completely blows an opportunity for airborne wonderment. Its the moment when Peter/Spidey takes his girlfriend for her first cobwebbed ride. (Her name is now Gwen not Mary Jane and shes played by Emma Stone not Kirsten Dunst.) Secretly together in her bedroom they want to leave the apartment without her parents knowing hes been there so they leap out of the window Gwen hanging on to him for dear life. Yet we never get to see her reaction let alone experience the plummeting descent and presumed upswoop from her point of view The next shot shows nothing but two tiny dots swinging past the camera at the end of a very long web. The director Marc Webb presides over many elisions and lapses. We dont see the transformation of Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) into the giant mutant known as the Lizard; the process starts in a taxicab but the next thing you know the Lizard is scaling the Williamsburg Bridge in all his enormous monstrosity. (Smaller lizards start swarming around the city but the story loses track of them just as it loses track of a villainous scientist played by the splendid Indian actor Irrfan Khan.) Peter needs to penetrate the inner sanctum of a supposedly impenetrable laboratory where deadly pathogens are being manufactured so he simply goes online does a quick bit of Googling gets the info he needs slips into the lab and wanders around unnoticed. Gwen a student at the high school Peter attends--they both look old enough for doctoral programs--conveniently works at the lab when she isnt in class. ENLARGE Andrew Garfield Jamie Trueblood/ (c) Columbia Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection Related Speakeasy Andrew Garfield Pulls Off Spider-Mans Mask Theres a sense of filling time with lame contrivance. In a convenience store Peter witnesses an argument about a penny that offends common sense. When it looks like Spidey is too weakened to prevail in the climactic battle with the Lizard everything pauses for a dopey interlude in which all the construction cranes on Sixth Avenue position their booms at a 90-degree angle so Spidey can swing from one to the next with greater ease on his trip uptown or maybe downtown. Yet the mystery that sets the plot in motion--what happened to Peters parents after they disappeared--is never resolved. (This Uncle Ben is played by Martin Sheen while Aunt May is now played by Sally Field made up to look absurdly haggard. Blue-collar women wash their hair too.) The film does open the heros soul to more than the nerdiness and repression of earlier incarnations. Peter Parker is now given to rage scorn humor and romance though the ragged script--credited to James Vanderbilt Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves--gives the star little chance for emotional nuance. Which brings us back to the need for suspension of memory. If you can forget what you know about how appealing Mr. Garfield was in ""The Social Network""; about how sensationally witty Ms. Stone was in ""Easy A"" (she has been reduced to a foil for Peters moods and needs); about the excitement of sexual tension (theres almost none between Peter and Gwen); about the pleasures of well-crafted drama (scene after shaky scene drifts off tentatively) and about movies that deliver on their promises (this origin tale turns into a wait-for-the-next-episode tease) then you can watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" without a sinking sense of being gypped. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com ENLARGE DVD Focus Miss Bala (2011) The Mexican drug wars seen from Mexico entirely through the eyes of a beauty-contest winner. Laura (Stephanie Sigman) a 23-year-old innocent from Tijuana falls into the clutches of the Baja California narco gang that engineered her triumph. (The ironic title means ""Miss Bullet."") Gerardo Naranjo the filmmaker who wrote this shockingly powerful film with Mauricio Katz never insists on symbols--theres too much action and agonizing suspense for that--but its irresistible to see his heroine as a stand-in for her beautiful country increasingly a hostage to savage crime. Frida (2002) Salma Hayek produced and stars in this English-language feature directed by Julie Taymor about the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and her tumultuous love affair with the muralist Diego Rivera; hes played by Alfred Molina. The film is inventive and gorgeously colored from the opening shot of a peacock in a garden to later renderings of Kahlos paintings as tableaux vivants. But the script based on Hayden Herreras biography resembles Riveras murals--its writ large broad and flat with spasms of agitprop style that come together as heavily as the ox-yoke eyebrows on Fridas face. Easy A (2010) The movie that made Emma Stone a star. I know Im like a broken record in recommending it but this high-school comedy directed by Will Gluck from an elated and elating screenplay by Bert V. Royal hasnt received the respect or success it deserves. Ms. Stone plays Olive Penderghast an Ojai Calif. high-school student who goes to class in a bustier emblazoned with the scarlet A of an adulteress. How she reaches this point is a convoluted story and a hilarious one. Suffice it to say that Olive identifies intensely with Hester Prynne the outcast heroine of ""The Scarlet Letter."" --Joe Morgenstern Explore More Jason Bourne Review Looping Old Loops Gleason Review Inspiration Off the Gridiron Indignation Review Life and Love in the 50s Star Trek Beyond Review Boldly Going Where It Has Been Dont Think Twice Review Making It Up as We Go Lights Out Review Flickering Frights Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Floating Food Forest Arrives in New York City RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The great Mexican artist and bohemian poster girl led a life filled with passion pain political fireworks and steely determination. The great love of her life whom she married twice was fellow artist and notorious womanizer Diego Riviera. She had an affair with Leon Trotsky and numerous lovers of both genders. Horribly injured in a bus accident in 1925 she lived until 1954 in constant battle with physical pain all of which she used to fuel her haunting autobiographical paintings. And if director Julie Taymors ""Frida"" has it right she had the most colorful wardrobe in the Western Hemisphere. Whether hiking atop Mayan ruins or putting the make on Josephine Baker in Paris this revolutionary was always dressed to kill.Producer-star Salma Hayek won the race to bring Frida to the screen and she brought aboard theatrical dynamo Taymor (""The Lion King"") to direct. Four writers are credited with the script. Mercifully the movie neither turns Kahlo into a plaster saint nor a feminist victim. Its clearly a labor of love. So why does this chronicle of a passionate life refuse to catch fire? For all of Taymors flashy embellishments--surreal dream sequences constructivist collages come to life--it trudges through the Kahlo chronology with the dutiful step of a conventional Hollywood biopic.It wasnt a bad idea to conceive of the film as an epic complex love story between Frida and Rivera (Alfred Molina) but the passion between them is more rhetorical than palpable. Theres something remote and stagy about ""Frida""; though it was shot in Mexico you feel as if the cast is just down there on a visit. And when Geoffrey Rush in shaky possession of a Russian accent strides onto the scene as Trotsky the movie comes dangerously close to resembling a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week How is Hayek? Shes got the look the adventurousness the seductiveness. But good as she is she can only go so deep and ""Frida"" could succeed only with a great actress (the young Anna Magnani?) in the role someone who could take us to the marrow of Kahlos demons and delights. Taymor and Hayak give us only the rough sketch of a wild soul.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The Mexican painter was spirited rebellious proudly true to her idiosyncratic talents and despite being crippled in a bus accident she led an unusually eventful life. Just the ingredients for a romantic inspirational drama Or for a thin string of colourful cliches. Thats far too harsh an assessment of Hayeks well meaning hymn to the determination and artistic originality of a national heroine but it does point up the weaknesses of the film. Notwithstanding an eagerness to display her bust at regular intervals the actress/producer makes for an efficient lead and the same is true of Molinas Diego Rivera. Kahlos relationship with the womanising muralist is the movies backbone as opposed to the link between experience and art which is stated not dramatised. The script rushes events races past characters deploys welcome animation and special effects for dreams trips abroad and paintings come to life. It also fields irritatingly cute cameos. Those unfamiliar with Kahlos life and work will find it lively and informative but depth of character and insights into the creative process arent part of the hagiographic equation.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Starring Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina. Directed by Julie Taymor. (VHS and DVD. R. 118 minutes.) In her paintings Frida Kahlo laid bare the anguish and disappointment of her life. Maimed by a hideous streetcar accident haunted by infirmities childlessness and endless medical experiments Kahlo created terrifying self- portraits as a martyr to pain. Art became an angry rebuke against fate a survival mechanism and an inquiry into suffering. Why then does ""Frida"" touch so briefly on that inflamed connection between art and life and focus instead on her tumultuous marriage to Diego Rivera? ""Frida"" was produced by Mexican actress Salma Hayek who fought for this film and triumphed when other efforts one by Madonna didnt get off the ground. But Hayek despite her zeal and despite the visual imagination of director Julie Taymor delivers a domestic melodrama with biopic cliches. With raw material so rich how did they go so wrong? Born in 1907 to a Hungarian Jewish father and devout Catholic mother Kahlo was encouraged to paint contracted polio at 6 was disabled by the streetcar accident at 18 and was married to Rivera a notorious womanizer and established muralist at 21. In ""Frida"" she spends most of her time flying into rages when her 300-pound husband 21 years older takes another lover. ""It meant nothing"" he pleads. ""It had all the emotion of a handshake."" Hayek conjures Frida with festive peasant clothes the furry eyebrows that meet in the center but shes much too beautiful and shapely to be believable as Kahlo. Frida was a woman who suffered lifelong pain and the scars of a metal streetcar rod that entered her left hip and impaled her through the stomach and vagina. Taymor director of the stage version of ""The Lion King"" builds a lush palette of saturated colors and gives the film its saving grace surrealistic vignettes that conjure Kahlo and her art. After the streetcar accident she injects a trippy little sequence that takes us inside an animated hospital where puppet skeletons do their work on the damaged Frida. Later when Rivera is feted by New York society Taymor illustrates the frenzy with playful takeoffs on ""King Kong"". . Raw language nudity sexual situations.

Directed by Julie Taymor from a screenplay by Clancy Sigal Diane Lake Gregory Nava and Anna Thomas based on the biography by Hayden Herrera. 118 minutes. Rated R for sexuality nudity and language. Metro Meridian. Somewhere surely in the dim volumes of art history lurks a talented artist who lived out his/her life with a happy supportive helpmate. But dont expect to see a movie about this person any time soon. Like Ed Harris ""Pollock"" Julie Taymors ""Frida"" is first and foremost the story of a relationship rather than an examination of an artist. Producer Sarah Green in Seattle last month for a preview screening confirmed this in her words of introduction. ""Frida"" she said is a love story. Not that theres anything wrong with that and certainly theres not much wrong with what ""Frida"" is a well-told tale and a colorful showcase for a marvelously steely performance by Salma Hayek (shes never been better) and for Taymors trademark visual flair. Really my only quarrel with ""Frida"" is for what it isnt a portrait of the artist as a woman and a painter rather than as half of a couple. Frida Kahlo the famed painter whose work adorns museums tote bags and calendars the world over lived most of her brief and eventful life in her native Mexico. As a young woman she suffered massive injuries in a bus accident (depicted here as a wondrously gold-dusted fever dream followed by a bloody macabre animation sequence) which necessitated numerous operations casts harshly confining corsets and endless therapy. At 22 she married the already-famed painter Diego Rivera a man many years older and the two pledged to be loyal to each other if not faithful. Their relationship a series of separations infidelities and reunions that included a divorce and remarriage lasted until her death at 47. ""I suffered two grave accidents in my life"" Kahlo once said in a line echoed in the film. ""One in which a streetcar knocked me down. ... The other accident is Diego."" This is spicy stuff and its understandable that Taymor and the screenwriters (including an uncredited Edward Norton who also appears in the film as Nelson Rockefeller) chose to focus on it rather than the admittedly much more difficult task of exploring a painters relationship with her work. Its a bit disappointing though that for entire stretches of ""Frida"" its easy to forget that shes an artist -- the paintbrushes and the works that result from them feel secondary. But theres a great deal to admire in this often-beautiful film not the least of which is the emergence of Hayek as a bravura actress. As Frida shes as intense as the peacock-blue walls of her home in Mexico Citys culturally rich Coyoacan district -- bursting with energy as a young girl staring at the ceiling as if to drill two holes in it as she lies bedridden dancing a sultry tango at a party after her marriage. Shes wisely subtle in conveying Fridas physical defects but even when barely limping (biographer Hayden Herrera notes that Kahlo went through periods when her disability was almost unnoticeable) Hayek gives the sense of being slightly misaligned of placing weight oddly while walking. Alfred Molina looking massive next to the tiny Hayek is perfectly cast as the bear-like Rivera seamlessly blending love and thoughtlessness. Roger Rees in the small role of Fridas German-born father contributes a gem of a performance (and an effortless Mexican-German accent) quietly watching his daughter through kind concerned eyes. And Taymor drenches the film in color -- Fridas red and green wedding outfit is so vivid that it seems to drain the hues from everything around it. And her re-creations of Kahlos paintings though too few are stunning. In one soaked in blue Frida stares unblinkingly into a mirror; in another Fridas green Mexican dress hangs outside a New York window among the grayish rows of apartment buildings. Its enough to make you scurry off to find a book about Frida Kahlo -- which is perhaps the ultimate compliment for a film biography. Moira Macdonald 206-464-2725 or mmacdonaldseattletimes.com.

But this biography of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo doesnt give us much more insight into the enigmatic artists psyche than what pop culture has already provided. Salma Hayek and her boyfriend Ed Norton attend the Los Angeles premiere of Frida. By Lucy Nicholson AFP In focusing mostly on her stormy 25-year relationship with Mexican painter Diego Rivera the story leaves Frida in his large shadow -- even in a movie that is supposed to be about her. Everything else however is breathtaking. Director Julie Taymor known for eye-popping works such as the stage production of The Lion King and the 1999 film Titus creates a vibrant world. Kahlos surrealistic paintings come to multidimensional life in gorgeous ways and the tale unfolds in brilliant hues as captivating as Kahlo and Riveras art. And the musical score is richly evocative and conveys Fridas emotionally fraught existence. A seductively luminous Salma Hayek seems to inhabit Kahlo physically though shes a softer version than the heavy-browed photos and self-portraits weve seen. (Never has anyone looked so good in a full body cast.) This is undoubtedly the strongest performance of her career and her passion for the project is palpable. Alfred Molina as Rivera also gives a wonderfully powerful performance managing such a strong physical resemblance to the artist that hes nearly unrecognizable. More on the movie Frida (out of four) Stars Salma Hayek Alfred Molina Geoffrey Rush Ashley Judd Valeria Golino Edward Norton Antonio Banderas Director Julie Taymor Distributor Miramax Films Rating R for sexuality nudity and language Clearly more energy was spent on visually and aurally capturing the mood and sensual feel of Kahlos world than on the substance of her story. The spectacular costumes and production design only make the superficiality of the story more sadly apparent. Still the strength of that work would have been enhanced by a more probing screenplay which underwent several script changes. Were left wanting a better sense of who Kahlo really was in addition to being the friend/lover/protegee of Rivera. Her adult life was racked by intense physical pain stemming from a trolley accident she endured at 18. Perhaps that could have provided clues to why she was able to endure the emotional pain of her relationship with Rivera but no connections are made. Kahlo was a free spirit who engaged in lusty affairs with men and women yet she was almost slavishly devoted to Rivera and never quite got over his womanizing ways. It would have been intriguing to further probe that paradox. One of her many lovers was Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky who was given asylum in Mexico but that relationship and the controversy it elicited is glossed over. Its too bad that this long-awaited movie didnt go further than faithfully re-creating Kahlos artwork and her studied look. Her passionate and tragically short life (she died at 47) is ideal Hollywood material but the audience is left wanting a more in-depth portrait.

The Mexican painter spent much of her adult life in excruciating physical pain the result of a horrible traffic accident. Her art was fiercely autobiographical not to say self-obsessed. And she was married twice to the compulsively unfaithful muralist Diego Rivera which ought to be enough excitement for anyone. And then there was the sex. I mean is it any wonder that she only managed to produce 200 paintings before she died? According to Julie Taymors new film Kahlo was terribly busy getting it on with Diego Rivera with his girlfriends and her own with Trotsky and again with Rivera. And when she wasnt having sex or trying to prevent Rivera from having sex with everyone but her including her own sister she was having feelings -- the grand over-the-top flights of joy and pain we anemic ordinary mortals know only from soap opera of which Frida is a superior specimen. This isnt entirely inappropriate for in the more than half a century since her death Kahlo has passed into mere celebrity not to say kitsch. Her radiantly angry face glowers out from posters key rings and mouse pads and outside art circles shes better known for her unibrow and furry upper lip than for her paintings. Shes also been co-opted not especially helpfully by a misguided wing of the womens movement bent on embalming every public female figure with a less than blissful domestic life as a tragic casualty of patriarchy. Taymor to her credit is having none of this. Frida which is adapted from a 1983 biography by Hayden Herrera steadfastly refuses to portray Kahlo as a hapless victim. Indeed without denying that Rivera was feckless promiscuous and incapable of sustaining a normal family life or that Kahlo suffered terribly from his infidelities and her own infirmity the movie is downright perky not to say brisk in tone. Frida begins as it ends with Kahlo (Salma Hayek) laughing through her pain as she arrives at her own retrospective in a four-poster bed. Then were swept back to her school days where we see her giggling like a regular Pippi Longstocking as she spies on Rivera (Alfred Molina) applying his creative juices to an artists model while being berated by his wife (Valeria Golino). This is good fun but I doubt whether Kahlo was ever quite the cheeky minx that Hayek portrays. Exuberant and irrepressible even in her bad movies the actress has presence to burn. (Its always a surprise to see how tiny she actually is especially here where shes lugging around an eyebrow that must weigh half as much as she does.) Making Frida was Hayeks lifes dream and if depth of character ization is not her strong suit at the very least she must be thanked for saving us from Madonna and J.Lo both of whom were interested in the project during the tortured eight years it took to get off the ground. That said the movie is not much more than a conventional biopic tricked out in the visual finery that has made Taymors theater work (The Odyssey The Haggadah The Lion King) so striking. Thrown perhaps by the resounding thud of her extravagant first film Titus or reportedly by the hovering scissors of Miramaxs Harvey Weinstein Taymor has gone resolutely pop with Frida not always in well-chosen ways. Im not sure which image is the more gratuitously sickening Kahlo impaled by a pole in the trolley-bus crash or the pretty gold dust that Taymor obsessively sprinkles around the artists prone body or later of the full frontal on her gangrenous toes. For the rest Frida tours the well-trodden highs and lows of Kahlos life raising the emotional temperature as it goes. We see her apprenticeship and subsequent marriage to Rivera the pairs numerous affairs fights separations and reconciliations and the final friendly accommodation that allowed them to live together until Kahlos death at 47 in 1954. Much shouting and posturing ensues with the odd exception of Alfred Molinas capable but incongruous underplaying which renders Rivera by any measure a larger-than-life figure as a naughty teddy bear to Kahlos impassioned diva.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm You can punch all sorts of holes in Frida. The endearingly awful script adapted and re-adapted by an army of writers treats us to regular bouts of Communist speechifying and an unwittingly hilarious encounter with a white-bearded Trotsky within whom lurks Geoffrey Rush hissing Russian sibilants as if his career depended on it. The movies feel for the political and artistic temper of the times is inbred at best. ""Youve aroused passions"" declaims Kahlo in New York to a Rivera crushed by the destruction of his Leninist mural for Nelson Rockefeller (an unusually tepid Edward Norton) ""made people think about their ideals. What other painter can claim that?"" Er Picasso maybe? Still theres something oddly moving about the film purely as a love story between two people who were more alike than was good for them yet somehow stuck it out. What we see in Frida is not Kahlo the painter but Kahlo the love of Riveras life as he was of hers -- a woman who gave as good as she got and still hung in where other less co-dependent women threw up their hands and fled. NOTWITHSTANDING HIS UNCIVIL DESIRE TO curdle the stomachs of his audience with a hyperactive hand-held camera young Dylan Kidd has talent. He can write dialogue work skillfully with actors and he has a pretty good handle on urban loneliness of the knowing virulent New York City variety. Kidd was also fortunate enough when it looked as though his script for Roger Dodger would go forever unnoticed to bump into Campbell Scott brave enough to show the actor the screenplay and luckier still that Scott who was tired of being cast as a sweet guy was looking for a role as a nasty piece of work. Scott plays the eponymous Roger a sleek advertising copywriter who spends his days ""thinking up ways to make people feel bad"" and his evenings either getting into the pants of women who cant resist his logorrheic charms or hurling quietly psychoanalytic insults at those who can. He cant stop spewing and when his boss (Isabella Rossellini powerful here even without makeup) with whom hes been having an affair dumps him Roger consoles himself with an extra-abusive tear through the bar scene which is interrupted by the arrival of his nephew Nick (the excellent Jesse Eisenberg) a pimply youth whos sorely in need of losing his virginity. The rest is a night out on a town insidiously lit in livid yellow and dark shadows in which Roger tries to initiate Nick into his philosophy of what makes women tick. Roger is the nonviolent version of Christian Bales mad yupster in American Psycho -- you see the attraction for distributor Artisan Entertainment which until its recent excursion into religion for kiddies (Veggie Tales) has made its money aggressively courting the snickering-youth demographic in films like The Blair Witch Project and Requiem for a Dream. Still Kidd has none of the cynicism of his anti-hero Its Nick -- earnest organic-minded Nick -- that the women go for. Theres a shattering shot of one of the pairs smart-mouthed dates (Jennifer Beals) who gives Nick his first kiss looking inconsolably sad in the shadowy back seat of a taxi as it pulls away. I was with Roger Dodger all the way until its vile hero had an 11th-hour burst of insight that defied all belief. I didnt buy it but I do want his therapists phone number.

The work of the late Mexican painter (she died in 1954 at the age of 44 or 47 depending on the source) is famous for its fantastical imagery and agonized vibrancy. But in recent years the unconventional life and personal flair of the artist have become as famous as her art. And Kahlo the person (tiny and hairy bisexual bent by polio and broken bones) has been glammed and outfitted into Frida the style setter a personage whose imprimatur could move merchandise at Bloomingdales. Frida Kahlos work conveys essential mysterious authentic female complexity; Frida the one-named celebrity conveys commodification as glib as that of Madonna - who as it happens is a leading collector of Kahlos work. So it is with Frida a biopic in which cinematic storytelling invention cant compete in the end with the movies glossy presentation of clothes earrings housewares politics sexual liaisons and tableaux vivants of artists at work. A revolutionary life has rarely felt less edgy or the biography of an iconoclast more bourgeois. This isnt the fault of the actors who while not especially electrifying are certainly sincere and devoted to their assignments. Salma Hayek makes a reasonable mildly spiced Kahlo and wears the famous Kahlo unibrow with dignity (although after one obligatory mug shot she hasnt got time for the famous Kahlo mustache); Alfred Molina serves stolidly as Diego Rivera Kahlos husband mentor and fellow artist hulking elephant to her tiny dove of a frame. But their scenes - of straying and reconciling of making art and making love of hell-raising and politicking - look like just that scenes staged with such laborious care and middlebrow admiration for famous arty lives lived large that the movie gives off the well-printed sheen of a coffee-table book. ""I was painting murals and womanizing in peace before you came along"" Rivera tells Kahlo in movie-speak and movie preciousness drains the cactus juice from ""Frida"" even when the catchy music is turned on full Mexican blare. A girl-girl tango scene between Hayek and Ashley Judd as photographer Tina Modotti is stiff with self-regard; a bedroom sex scene between Hayek and Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky is limp with silliness. (""Leon tell me about your children"" Kahlo murmurs to the Communist leader while touring Mexican antiquities speaking as daintily as Mrs. Bush taking tea with Mrs. Putin.) ""Frida"" is directed by Julie Taymor a forceful artist partial to the fantastical herself and brilliantly adept at it in staged fantasies like ""The Lion King."" Indeed Taymor sprinkles her movie with glittering miniature theater pieces that indulge the directors fondness for collage puppetry surrealism and cross-cultural spectacle. The interludes are lovely and busy but they seem like intrusions into the real business of ""Frida"" which is What Would Frida Wear?

Switching from the Shakespearean sophistication of her film debut ""Titus"" (which went over many heads) Julie Taymors robust and imaginative direction highlights Kahlos passionate love for fellow painter Diego Rivera. The brief life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is recounted as a heroic love story and survivors tale in ""Frida."" Switching from the Shakespearean sophistication of her film debut ""Titus"" (which went over many heads) Julie Taymors robust and imaginative direction highlights Kahlos passionate love for fellow painter Diego Rivera. Co-producer and star Salma Hayek makes the character an icon of female independence courage and nonconformity forecasting special appeal for women viewers. Pics splashy visuals bold sexual stance and vividly etched characters from Nelson Rockefeller to Leon Trotsky could help it go beyond the arthouse audience for whom Kahlo is a familiar name and reach out to a wider public. The pic represents a personal victory for Hayek whose seven-year struggle to get the picture made against all odds and rivals (including Jennifer Lopez teamed with Francis Ford Coppola and at one point Madonna). Bringing a fiery warmth and accessibility to the central role thesp proves a good match for the artist as she depicts Kahlos indomitable will to live love and paint. Film opens on Frida (Hayek) as a teen in 1922 Mexico City spying with her beau (Diego Luna) on famous mural painter Rivera (Alfred Molina) as he draws then attempts to seduce a model. To their amusement his lovemaking is interrupted by his wife Lupe Marin (a throaty down-to-earth Valeria Golino) neatly summing up the painters philandering nature and his unsuitability as a husband. It also sets up the climate of sexual permissiveness and experimentation that will characterize Fridas and Diegos relationship. Riding home on a tram Frida is involved in a gruesome crash with a bus. She is found with her foot crushed her spinal column and pelvis shattered and the lower part of her body pierced by a metal rod. The operations and recovery process that follow cost her untold pain and bankrupt her family; but while bedridden she begins to draw and paint. From this horrific beginning Fridas suffering (but also later her love) is shown to be the inspiration behind her surrealistic art which gives direct expression to her interior life. When shes able to walk again she boldly visits Rivera and asks him to critique her work. The instant chemistry between them brews a romance that turns into marriage -- Diegos third. Though her mother disapproves calling it ""the marriage of an elephant to a dove"" they share passionate natures and a strong commitment to radical politics. (Incidentally pic offers a striking view of Mexico as an artistic and political haven.) Their wedding reception is held at Communist party headquarters where members include renowned photographer Tina Modotti (Ashley Judd) and painter David Alfaro Siqueiros (Antonio Banderas in a one-scene bit). Though film doesnt try to gloss over their militancy it takes a distanced approach glamorizing the bohemian chic of artists like Rivera and Modotti as they slum in working-class bars. Several of these scenes seem to take their cue from Bernardo Bertoluccis ""The Conformist"" also set in the 30s particularly Judds cool elegance as Modotti and a sensual tango between her and Frida that publicly reveals latters bisexuality. The film also manages to be surprisingly neutral about right and wrong in the artistic faceoff between Diego and his New York patron Nelson Rockefeller (limned with humorous ambiguity by Edward Norton) who gets cold feet when Marx and Lenin appear on Riveras mural for the Rockefeller Center lobby. In the end Rockefeller fires him and has the mural destroyed but this event is overshadowed by Fridas traumatic miscarriage. Certainly some true events are stranger than fiction such as Fridas fling with the aged Leon Trotsky (an admirable Geoffrey Rush). Ultimately striking a balance among films many elements -- Fridas deteriorating relationship with Diego betrayal by her sister (Mia Maestro) her arrest after Trotskys assassination new paintings various family tragedies mounting pain after ever more torturous operations and illnesses -- proves more than the film can handle. The lack of a dramatic curve is keenly felt at the end and the poetic finale that is offered as a conclusion doesnt completely satisfy. Straining after vivid images like the ones that left an indelible mark on ""Titus"" Taymor finds inspiration from a variety of sources including floating gardens Aztec ruins Mexican death masks and period postcards used in some memorable special effects sequences that work much better than in her earlier film. But the films real visual coup is its re-creation of dozens of remarkable paintings by Kahlo now acknowledged as one of the greatest women artists of the 20th century. Many of these suddenly spring to life with Hayek or Molina in them underlining the close relationship between Fridas life and art. The actors seem to ease into their roles as the film progresses and the emotional temperature heats up. Hayek creates a full-bodied character with an obstinate lust for life. Molina throws himself into the role of the self-advertising bad-tempered womanizer Diego who matures into a better man. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto ably shifts pics tone from the gaudy colors and unfiltered sunlight of Mexico to sophisticated desaturated hues in New York and Paris. Production designer Felipe Fernandez del Paso gives the pic a strong ethnic look in his re-creations of Fridas incredible homes often the actual locations. Elliot Goldenthals score follows Mexican folk music quite closely with a lyrical sidestep sung by Caetano Velosa and Lila Downs.
