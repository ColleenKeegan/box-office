At times moody at times jovial its a balanced affair that routinely delivers entertainment in the form of flawless visuals and peppy dialogue. I really dug it. I think its the best of the series fairly easily and a testament to why occasionally throwing a massive budget at an endeavor of this scope can be considered a reasonable decision. The film opens with a moody orchestral bit; were transported to the land of Hogwarts and Muggles. Death Eaters are spiriting through the realm leaving a wide swath of destruction in their wake. Dumbledore finds Harry Potter. He needs his help. Stop me if youve heard this one before. Of course the strength of the Potter series has never been the opening gambit has it? The usual gang is back together and the complementary characters (Luna Ginny Cormac) provide as much comedy as the mains (Harry Hermione Ron) do comfort. Alan Rickmans Snape remains positively sublime hes able to do more with a blank stare than most actors do in their entire careers. An overarching sense of weirdness and magic pervades the entire movie ... or precisely what youd prescribe for a series like Harry Potter. The only negative is a slight ding for length (but honestly better 2.5 hours here than 90 minutes of Transformers Revenge of the Fallen) and an even slighter ding for not actually standing as a singular film. If youre not familiar with the books or previous films I imagine youd be lost. The film seems be of the persuasion that youre either one of the couple hundred million people whove already gotten on board or you cant possibly be brought up to speed quickly enough. I tend to agree though the film is getting that minus portion of the grade because aliens from space wouldnt know what to make of this movie sans context. For the attaboy portion director David Yates must be called to the front of the classroom and lauded. His touch here is deft there are so many well conceived and executed shots and scenes packed into the running time. A moment in particular that sticks out comes near the beginning of the film as the Weasley household gradually becomes aware that Harry Potter is coming for a visit. Yates shoots upward toward four levels of stairs and lets Ron Ginny Hermione and Ma Weasley pop out like whack-a-moles each with a line of dialogue. Its at once charming and effective bringing individual personality to the front while servicing the story as a whole. Well played. I think fans of the series will be pleased. Yes it is a dark film without question but there are also numerous moments of frivolity to lend levity. Its about friendship hope first love evil and magic -- and its all wrapped into a fantastical epic narrative. For lack of a better word its a very graceful effort. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a difficult film to dislike as care and concern has been injected into every millisecond of this stylish blockbuster. Theres a moment in the film where Potter and the gang wonder aloud how they always manage to get themselves into such convoluted predicaments. As an audience we can only be grateful that they continually do.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Video 2009 Like its predecessors this sixth installment in the behemoth fantasy franchise outstays its welcome by a bum-numbing half hour; unlike them it devotes about half its screen time to chaste multisided romantic intrigues the boy wizard (Daniel Radcliffe) and his coed cohorts having attained exquisite young adulthood. As usual the residuum of plot involves Harrys meandering pursuit of various supernatural MacGuffins without which the forces of darkness are bound to triumph. Director David Yates presides over some gorgeous CGI set pieces but all the real magic comes from the scrum of ace British character actors (Michael Gambon Alan Rickman Robbie Coltrane Timothy Spall and the always brilliant Jim Broadbent who steals the show as a dithering Hogwarts don come out of retirement). For what it is its fine. PG 153 min. By Cliff Doerksen User Rating Official Site www.harrypotter.comDirector David YatesWriter Steve Kloves and J.K.

David Yates directed ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" Here he approaches the follow-up installment of J.K. Rowlings page-turners with an appreciation of shadow and light grief and hope that makes these big-screen adaptations joyous and weighty. Love and menace are in the air. And both get their unnerving due as Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) dear friends Ron and Hermione as well as rival Draco Malfoy return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Draco has undertaken a malicious mission. Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) have endearingly confused feelings. And Harry is not immune to muddled romantic notions. At the conclusion of ""Order of the Phoenix"" Harry and Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) headmaster of Hogwarts were vindicated when the Ministry of Magic finally acknowledged that Voldemort -- a.k.a. The Dark Lord a.k.a. ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" -- was indeed on the prowl. ""The Half-Blood Prince"" -- adapted by Steve Kloves who returns to this sequel after writing the first four films -- opens with the sort of dark disturbances that seem to rebuff the MPAAs decision to bump this film to a PG from the series typical PG-13. Death Eaters swoop down like violent gusts of smoke upon the Muggle world causing mass upheaval and yes death. In addition to a bridge collapsing there are other signs that the filmmakers borrowed some visual cues from action flicks with their penchant for destruction. And a scene outside the Weasleys ramshackle and charming homestead has a touch of horror. What makes this palatable is story. ""Half-Blood Prince"" is rife with images that plunge us into Harrys symbol-saturated world. This swirling darkness is visually echoed later. This time its in water not air as Harry investigates memories Dumbledore has been keeping in vials. This is the type of resonant imagery that invites repeat viewings and makes the film literary. One of the grand pleasures of these movies remains the way in which they move between somber and fleet dark and light. Jim Broadbent joins a veteran cast so good at what they do that its easy to take them for granted (Alan Rickman as Severus Snape chief among them). A one time professor at Hogwarts Horace Slughorn has a mysterious relationship to the boy who became Voldemort Tom Riddle. As the film opens Dumbledore is luring him back to the school with Harry. Broadbent is often hilarious as the fussy teacher who takes a bit too much pride in former students. One might imagine that the riddle of Tom Riddle and the identity of the ""half-blood prince"" are the chief mysteries of the tale. But with its deft handling of teen yearning and affection ""Half-Blood Prince"" maneuvers mysteries of heart and hankering that resound in worlds magic and Muggle.

Warner Bros. hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Growing Pains Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) find a more mature brand of magic in the sixth installment of the Harry Potter series. Warner Bros. With a wave of his wand Harry Potter can separate millions of movie patrons from the contents of their wallets. But he cant wave away swine flu. In Argentina where Im spending some time this summer its called ""Gripe A"" and to impede its spread authorities have told movie theaters to reduce the number of tickets they sell -- and to ask moviegoers to leave seats between themselves and other patrons. These not being ideal conditions for premiering a worldwide smash like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Warner Bros. decided to postpone the films opening here by a week. Happily I was able to catch a critics screening and though reviewers had to sit close together in a small screening room no one sneezed so the magic went undisturbed. Its a more mature magic than in previous Potter movies. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his buddies Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have grown up a bit since we last saw them and are now subject to the same raging hormones as any other 16-year-olds. Under the tutelage of a Hogwarts faculty culled from the highest ranks of British thespians our spell-casting heroes and their classmates are learning to brew love potions this year with results mostly played for laughs -- as when Ron eats some romance-inspiring cookies meant for Harry. As with the rest of J.K. Rowlings adventures however the real world is never too far away. Unrequited crushes inspire the shedding of a tear or two. And theres nothing terribly subtle about the way director David Yates shoots the films mandatory Quidditch match with randy boys showing off for their girlfriends by riding their brooms for all theyre worth. Sometimes as Freud would doubtless say a broomstick is just a broomstick. Here not so much. Still all of that will doubtless fly right over the heads of younger audiences who will delight in the hugely popular franchises customary displays of magic. That the action pauses this time to set up emotional conflicts alongside the ones that rely primarily on special-effects wizardry -- well count that as a boon for any adults who are brought along for the ride.

The filmmakers have certainly honored the book which is famously dark though with bright spots provided by the stirrings of teenage romance. And that chiaroscuro is enhanced by some very funny moments in the movie; the director David Yates has lightened his touch since the previous installment. But the books dramatic challenge is its overall sense of incipiency rather than immediacy--great events arent happening quite yet theyre soon to happen. (While the death of a major character is momentous its mainly symbolic as a passing of the torch.) In a mythical analog to ""The Gathering Storm"" the stage is being set for the final epic battle between Harry and Lord Voldemort. For those whove lived with the series for more than a decade this fateful pause may heighten the suspense. For a Muggle like me the storm does gather slowly. The Fantastic Franchise An interactive look at the billion-dollar empire of Harry Potter books and films. You wouldnt guess it from the excitement of the first action sequence. With Voldemort returned as if from the dead an unholy trio of Death Eaters terrorize London by reaching down with invisible black fingers--theyre scarily visible to us--that wreak chaos in the streets and turn the Millennium Bridge into a metallic pretzel. Soon afterward however the pace slows to a saunter as Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore enlists Harry in a mission to seek out the schools former Potions professor Horace Slughorn. Dumbledore is played as before by Michael Gambon a great actor who has finally settled fully into the role. Slughorn is played by Jim Broadbent another great actor --the adjective isnt used loosely in either case--who gets to do a wonderful drunk scene that turns into something more serious and poignant. (The screenplay was adapted by Steve Kloves.) The whole antic mission to find Slughorn turns into something serious and genuinely intriguing. Its always tempting to lapse into plot summaries when dealing with a Harry Potter movie since the plots are so elaborate and the details are so much a part of the storys spirit as well as its substance. Instead of jumping into that rabbit hole Ill simply say that Slughorns role involves recovered memory that the recovery process involves advanced potions that the memories are meant for exploring Voldemorts vulnerabilities and that some of them just like those of eyewitnesses in courts of law turn out to be entirely unreliable. ENLARGE Harry Potter more complex and mature. Warner Brothers Pictures ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" may suffer by comparison to visual memories of the first film which wasnt all that wonderful but teemed with wondrous images--a first look at the Great Hall a first trip on the Hogwarts Express a first game of Quidditch. That was all about the thrill of discovery of course about first steps on a long and winding road. Now that the series is near the end of that road--two more films will be adapted from the final book--the original fun-house tone has given way to complexity and maturity. Daniel Radcliffe a sweet-faced preteen when the first movie was released has become such an engaging young man that Harrys attraction to Rons sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright) seems less a matter of heedless infatuation--Slughorns most dangerous home brew is an infatuation potion--than the early onset of love. At its worst the movie feels less like a labor of love than a labor of labor --industrialized enchantment with an elegant veneer thats compounded of among other elements Stuart Craigs production design Jany Temimes costumes Bruno Delbonnels brooding cinematography and a seductive array of special effects supervised by Tim Burke. But the pace quickens and the intensity grows toward the end. (In the films most impressive sequence strongly reminiscent of ""The Lord of the Rings"" Gollum-esque monstrosities rise up from the sea to pull Harry under and down.) And the enterprise continues to be blessed by veteran English actors who lend authority to their every scene Mr. Gambon of course whose Dumbledore is a mere century and a half old; Mr. Broadbent to be sure and the supremely acerbic Alan Rickman whose Snape figures intricately in the proceedings. Theyre the authentic wizards of the piece.

Rowlings series has beautiful special effects and something even more rare Magic Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Harry Potter Movies Entertainment News Michael Gambon and Daniel Radcliffe Every summer were reminded of Hollywoods maniacal drive to give us increasingly bigger allegedly better special effects. But ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" -- the sixth installment in the series of movies based on J.K. Rowlings roaringly popular novels -- suggests a less flashy and far more rewarding strategy What we really need arent bigger special effects but more magical ones -- and having a story worth telling should always be the foundation. The effects in ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" are so believable they seem more naturalistic than special; theyre situated so perfectly in their imagined universe that we have no trouble believing in their authenticity. The brass owl decorating the podium in Hogwarts dining hall moves and preens until Dumbledore steps forward to speak at which point it spreads its wings and respectfully freezes into position; when Hermione (Emma Watson) reshelves books in the library they swoop out of her hands and find their appropriate places on even the highest of shelves; a quidditch match takes place during a snowfall a believable velvety backdrop for the players as they dip and swirl through the air on their broomsticks. In ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" magic happens as the characters are busy doing other things -- playing sports falling in love nursing broken hearts. And while this is of course a fantasy movie the quiet and potent idea nestled inside it is that theres magic in and around the things of everyday life.Theres also danger anxiety ill will and heaps of bad attitude and ""The Half-Blood Prince"" doesnt skimp on any of it. The director is David Yates who also made the 2007 ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix."" (Yates is currently finishing the final two movies in the series adapted from Rowlings seventh and last Harry Potter book the 2007 ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."" His previous credits include the BBC series ""State of Play."") ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" felt both truncated and sprawling perhaps partly because Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg were faced with the tough task of trimming and adapting the longest of the Harry Potter books. But ""The Order of the Phoenix"" yielded some lovely moments including one in which Daniel Radcliffes Harry tries to describe his first kiss to Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione only to find words inadequate.With ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" -- which like the first four ""Harry Potter"" movies was adapted by Steve Kloves who is also at work on ""Deathly Hallows"" -- Yates has become even more sure-footed. Hes better at framing and connecting the movies big dramatic sequences (including a near-perilous journey Harry takes with Michael Gambons Dumbledore in which the former is set upon by an army of terrifying water-dwelling zombies) while hes as skillful as ever at shaping the storys quieter moments into moving vital miniatures. ""The Half-Blood Prince"" -- with the help of Bruno Delbonnels cautiously majestic cinematography and Stuart Craigs reliably gorgeous production design -- is a beautifully paced feat of filmmaking one that navigates potentially choppy shifts in scale with grace and ease.The movie opens just as a trio of Death Eaters descend upon the Muggle world in London swooping down -- clearly at the behest of their boss Lord Voldemort -- to destroy the Millennium Bridge. Harry is just finishing up his summer vacation chatting up an extremely cute girl at a modest cafe when Dumbledore pops onto the scene. (He makes his appearance in front of an Underground advertisement for a brand of perfume; the words ""Divine Magic"" stretch behind him like an introductory banner.) It has become increasingly clear that something really really bad is going to happen at Hogwarts something that will affect the whole world and its Harrys responsibility to stop it with Dumbledore as his guide. Then theres that other business of actually growing up which is also fraught with dangerous hiccups. Harry does have the help of his best friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley but they have troubles of their own Hermione is in love with Ron but he doesnt know it; Ron has become a quidditch star and as such has attracted the fawning attention of a dippy classmate Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). Meanwhile Harry and Ginny Weasley (played by the suitably composed and serene Bonnie Wright) circle each other warily Harry clearly has a crush on her but shes dating someone else and Rons hovering protectiveness doesnt help either. You Might Also Like In ""The Half-Blood Prince"" there are obvious villains (like Bellatrix Lestrange played by crazy-eyed pint-sized Helena Bonham Carter) possibly ambiguous villains (like Alan Rickmans stately creepy sexy Severus Snape and Tom Feltons Draco Malfoy whos grown into a tall sneering blond straight out of Duran Duran) and random figures who are essentially decent but who havent always taken the right path (like Potions professor Horace Slughorn played by Jim Broadbent an affable tippler who ""collects"" star students so he can drop their names later). Theres also the usual assortment of classmates including one of my personal favorites the flaxen-haired space case Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) who drifts through the movie like a pale Victorian ghostie. (She has a fine moment in which she appears as if out of nowhere in a lion headdress ready to cheer the Gryffindor House quidditch team to victory.)Rowlings Harry Potter novels begin as childrens books and gracefully evolve into young-adult fiction and its in ""The Half-Blood Prince"" that the suffering and frustration of adolescence really begin to emerge with great clarity. Yates contrasts those small moments of terror with bigger ones One of the most unnerving sequences features an image borrowed directly from J-horror. But Yates is attuned to all kinds of emotional pain and his youthful actors -- who have become both stronger and more relaxed as performers with each successive movie -- are right in step with him. In one scene Hermione suffers as she watches Ron willingly cuddle up to Lavender. Shes conjured a circle of swirling little birds -- as she tells Harry in whom she tentatively confides her heartbreak theyre the result of a charm spell shes practicing. When Ron clumsily fails to grasp that hes hurt her she sends the birds hurtling toward his head -- they narrowly miss his head and shatter in a mist of feathers on the wall behind him tiny floating remnants of her fury and pain. Yates also guides his actors through a scene of astonishing erotic beauty an encounter between two characters thats more tender than it is overly sexualized. The moment takes place amid a jumble of old magical artifacts Romantic love as an idea may technically be very old but its the young who keep it new by continually breathing life into it. Yates handles the movies most devastating scene -- a moment of swift but incalculable loss -- so deftly that you almost cant believe the unthinkable is actually happening. ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is partly a story about the old ceding the world to the young even before the young are ready for it. At one point Gambons Dumbledore summons Harry to his chambers needing to speak to him about some very serious business. But first he cautiously mentions that hes noticed how much time Harry spends with Hermione. Are the two of them perhaps ...? Dumbledore doesnt even have to finish the question. Gambon plays the moment with a wonderful shy delicacy.Harry tells him that he and Hermione are just friends but the idea is clear. Dumbledore wants Harry to find love -- to find all the things that might give him pleasure in life in addition to all the heavy-duty responsibilities hes already carrying. One of the pleasures of watching the emerging mosaic of the ""Harry Potter"" movies has been seeing how each director puts his own stamp on the source material Alfonso Cuaron gave us a brooding beautiful ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban""; Mike Newells ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was more pastoral but hardly comforting.By the series completion Yates will have directed half of the ""Harry Potter"" movies and that mutes the surprise element a bit. But ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" at least ensures that the franchises remaining movies are in good hands. Yates understands the bond and the continuity thats so essential between the old and the young. In one of the movies loveliest scenes Broadbents professor Slughorn slightly sozzled describes to Harry a piece of magic worked by one of his former students. He describes this wonderful delicate feat so vividly that his words are more effective than visuals would be. And as it turns out this bit of magic had been worked by Harrys long-dead mother Lily. It was Slughorn tells Harry peering at him as if through mist ""the most beautiful magic."" Thats a measure of how subtle a spectacle Yates has given us with ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" The most beautiful magic in it is left unseen. And still it emerges with absolute clarity. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 15 2009 1129 AM Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Kind of like 90210 with owls. By Dana Stevens After youve seen Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion of the latest Hogwarts gossip You can also click here to download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. Daniel Radcliffe Bonnie Wright David Thewlis and Oliver Phelps in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince In 2007 I ended my review of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix with the sentiment ""I can hardly wait for school to start again."" Two years later with the release of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (Warner Bros.) Ive come down with a bad case of senioritis. (A premature one too. Now that the last book in the series Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has been split into two upcoming movies graduation night is a long way off.) The Half-Blood Prince feels like the dreariest Harry Potter movie since The Chamber of Secrets in 2002--or maybe its just that any film franchise designed to span an entire decade feels dreary by default. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. At two hours and 33 minutes this latest installment directed by David Yates (who helmed the last film and who has bravely signed on for the duration of the franchise) gives the viewer ample downtime to reflect on the true wizardry the Potter movies have to offer. Like Michael Apteds 7Up films which track a group of British schoolchildren from youth through middle age the Potter series has allowed us to watch as three children Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (playing respectively Harry; his best friend Ron Weasley; and their almost-but-never-quite love interest Hermione Granger) grow from sweet-faced 11-year-olds to rangy young adults. Thats an unusual privilege in the movies where the process of maturation is usually represented by the replacement of younger actors with older ones who vaguely resemble them. Our simple sense of familiarity with these actors and the goodwill theyve built up over the course of the series stands in for some of the character development thats missing from The Half-Blood Prince. That goodwill comes in handy around the midpoint when you begin to recognize this episodes chief flaw the absence of a juicy villain. Ralph Fiennes spectral Lord Voldemort appears only as a cloud formation looming over the proceedings; his evil designs on Harry are carried out mainly by the remarkably dull Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) a fellow student who having defected to the dark side sulks around the halls of Hogwarts like a high-school Goth fresh from a spree at Hot Topic. Helena Bonham Carter pops up at intervals as the far scarier Bellatrix Lestrange but her screen time is so limited that her character remains frustratingly vague. For example why is she pregnant the first time we see her but not thereafter? Has she given birth to some awful creature that will haunt the final episodes? Advertisement Most of The Half-Blood Prince is unconcerned with questions about the nature and genesis of evil and its not until the last half-hour that were treated to an old-school metaphysical showdown. This movie is just a long place-keeper episode devoted to the shifting of allegiances both academic and romantic. As the new school year begins Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) the wizard headmaster of Hogwarts gives his star student Harry a task Hes to get friendly with Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) the newly rehired Potions teacher who possesses some information about Voldemorts past that could help to defeat the dark lord once and for all. Meanwhile Harry nurses a crush on Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) the sister of his best friend Ron who is in turn pursued by the lovesick ninny Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). Hermiones latent crush on Ron develops into full-blown pining as she watches him canoodle with Lavender and theres a good deal of drama about whos going with whom to a holiday party at professor Slughorns house. In short too much of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince resembles a lesser episode of Beverly Hills 90210 with owls. Despite the preponderance of (PG-rated) snogging there are pleasures to be found along this movies meandering path. As always the production design (by Stuart Craig who has been with the series since the beginning) is a labyrinthine marvel of detail. Hogwarts presented in a desaturated palette that matches the series increasingly gloomy mood looks more enticingly explorable than ever. Alan Rickman as the haughty professor Severus Snape chews over each syllable as if mouthing some unspeakably distasteful goo. In a rather drab cliffhanger of an ending Harry and his buddies gather on a parapet to swear a solemn oath that as God is their witness there will be two sequels. But in spite of the plodding tone of this antepenultimate chapter theres something touching about the Harry Potter series loyal love for its source material.  Whatever happens in the final faceoff between Harry and Voldemort when the last movie comes out in the summer of 2011 a beautiful and intricate world will have come to an end.

The performance is a lovely concoction of tics stammers and squints. But the character is a device something to be unlatched and opened so the plot can move to the next locked door. Sadly that door is in the next movie. Theres enough cliffhanging to give you vertigo.Slughorn knows crucial information about the world-ending dark lord Voldemort who killed Harrys parents and whom we get to see courtesy of a vial containing his memories when he was a mean young Hogwarts student named Tom Riddle. Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) recruits Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) to get the professor to open up. Harrys proficiency at making a ""living death potion makes Slughorn easier to charm; Harry happens to be using an old textbook that according to an inscription once belonged to someone called the Half-Blood Prince.Meanwhile the young moody and acutely blond Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) begins his stint as Voldemorts recruit to assassinate Dumbledore with the secret backing of Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman as deliciously reptilian as he always is in these films).Theres a biblical tinge to some of this even if most of these movies feel interchangeable with Peter Jacksons ""Lord of the Rings trilogy. Partly its because Gambons Dumbledore - with his long white hair and matching scrunchied beard - looks like Moses by way of George Clinton and Gandalf the White. At some point Gambon uses a staff to part an infernal red sea which I think Ive seen Clinton do.Steve Kloves has written five of the ""Harry Potter screenplays and ""The Half-Blood Prince reeks of formula. An hour or so of interesting character development followed by 30 minutes of boredom then an hour of plot development. That second hour always feels as if Kloves just remembered that he has to lay the groundwork for the subsequent movie. The individual installments become extensions on a lengthening fuse.Until the final installment arrived two years ago this had been the darkest of the books and the movie picks up on most of those strains. Voldemort and his followers are terrorists. But for a series so faithful to its source these movies this one in particular also omit some of the boldest grimmest deeds. The films Malfoy maximizes only a fraction of his capacity for conscripted evil. He does however totally maximize his likelihood to appear as the frontman in an ABC tribute band.""The Half-Blood Prince does remain true to the books hormonal action. Harry and his best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) fend off eager suitors while pursuing the object of their own affections. Lust in this movie is far freakier and more exciting to these kids than magic. There are moments when the actors in this movie look like they want to be ravaged as much as Kristen Stewart does in ""Twilight. Radcliffe spent a wildly publicized almost-year onstage playing a sexually troubled kid in ""Equus. Buthes still subdued as Harry. When a waitress hits on Potter in a diner I was hoping shed say to Radcliffe ""I saw what you did with that horse.I like how magic in these movies is not a metaphor for sex. The metaphor for that at least for this film is Quidditch a sport whose players joust astride brooms and protect giant hoops. Theres also the hint of druggy subculture whenever the divinely droll Evanna Lynch appears as Luna Lovegood. She combats the movies occasional sluggishness with a hilarious sluggishness of her own. Shes part Anna Faris part hippie part pusher. And whatever she can do to bring out the psychedelia in the last two movies would be greatly appreciated.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Going a few shades blacker than 2007s already funereal Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix this penultimate Potter picture includes the firebombing of a series regulars home an episode of demonic possession that wouldnt look out of place in an Exorcist movie and multiple attempts on the life of Harry himself. The greater threat however is those unseen forces that compete for the hearts and minds of impressionable boy wizards.You can credit Potter creator J.K. Rowling with some of the darkening mood but also director David Yates the British TV veteran and feature-film neophyte who brought a nightmarish jolt to Order of the Phoenix effectively clearing out the cobwebs accrued two years earlier by Mike Newells stolid Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Yates who returns to the directors chair for Half-Blood Prince may not be as lyrical a film artist as Alfonso Cuaron (whose Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban remains the gold standard) but hes a bracing stylist in his own right whose gritty tactile images seem of a piece with the storys descent into what Joseph Campbell termed ""the belly of the whale."" By the end of Phoenix Harry had once more narrowly escaped the clutches of the resurrected Lord Voldemort witnessed the demise of his last living relative and beheld a prophecy that says when it comes to Harry and the Dark Lord only one can survive. And as the story resumes death is once again rapping on young Mr. Potters door.Whereas the previous Potter was structured as a coming-of-age story (with a pointed subtext about the benefits of real experience over book learning) here we get a double-barreled detective story with the venerable Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) searching for clues to Voldemorts apparent invincibility while Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) ferrets out an assassin lurking among the student body. Mostly though the film concerns itself with matters of destiny and the origins of evil. Like many a mythical arch villain Voldemort was (we learn in flashback) once a boy too plucked by Dumbledore from a Dickensian orphanage and enrolled in Hogwarts where he quickly rose to the head of the class until the tree of wizardly knowledge tempted him with its forbidden fruit. Now a present-day Hogwarts student may be preparing to follow in the Dark Lords footsteps.The movie isnt all gloom and doom mind you After the mercifully quidditch-free Phoenix the sport of choice for Hogwarts athletes is back. So for that matter are the adolescent hormonal stirrings (first seen around the time of Goblet of Fire) that wreak havoc on longtime BFFs Ron (the ever-ganglier Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) and periodically turn Half-Blood Prince into something closer to Fast Times at Hogwarts High. Theres an expanded role this time for Harrys moon-child classmate Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch who has the dingbat charm of the young Carol Kane). And lest he be the one U.K. character actor of his generation not already gainfully employed by the Potter factory Jim Broadbent joins the cast as potions teacher Horace Slughorn a former Hogwarts professor lured by Dumbledore back into the fold.With his quivering voice and fusty absentminded charm Slughorn is the sort of teacher we have all had at one time or another--an avuncular unapologetically old-fashioned bachelor or widower who endears himself to his students by treating them as equals rather than peons and who in turn validates himself through his students successes. He ""collects"" people Dumbledore advises Harry--literally in the case of the photos of famous ex-pupils adorning his mantel. But Slughorn also carries a deep private shame and Broadbent who plays the part quite brilliantly lets it infect the characters entire physicality. Perhaps it goes without saying that a photo of Slughorns most famous former student is conspicuously missing from that gilded shrine and the closer Harry gets to discovering why the more he finds in his newest teacher a fellow tragic tortured soul.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince wont make converts out of those who cant tell a Thestral from a Dementor and the series as a whole lacks the enveloping full-scale mythos of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But Id be lying if I didnt say this movie gave me as much innocent pleasure as any Ive seen this year. So I for one eagerly await the upcoming two-part series finale Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows whose title alone suggests it will still be a while before gray skies clear up for our intrepid hero. Yet curiously Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince closes on the incongruous image of sunlight poking through parted clouds burnishing Hogwarts in a radiant autumnal glow. Surveying the landscape Harry comments on its beauty even as he realizes that his supreme ordeal still lies before him and that it is sometimes dawn just before the darkest.

Pictures release. Half-Blood Prince has hints not much payoff BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; jwilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 Jul 1 2011 (...) Jaap Buitendijk Daniel Radcliffe Rupert Grint and Emma Watson in a scene from ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" a Warner Bros. Pictures release. Review originally published July 14 2009The ""Harry Potter"" movie series has been an amazing achievement under tricky circumstances. Since 2001 using a cast of newcomers the team has juggled darkness and light to entertain a maturing fan base. Although the movies have cast a longer shadow as the weight on the wizards shoulders has grown ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is like a light pause before the prophesied free-for-all between Harry and the dark lord Voldemort.The danger of pausing is that a juggler can drop the ball. Speaking these words could get me sent to the dungeon of doom but I am honor-bound to report that ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is as insubstantial as fairy dust. While the romantic sweetness that its peddling is a guilty pleasure its also a distraction from the gathering storm that the series had been charting so well.That storm crosses over into the non-wizard world in the explosive opening as Voldemorts minions - the Death Eaters - destroy the Millennium Bridge in London. Yet that bloodless destruction is the last we hear of the outside world - and the last memorable action sequence for at least the next two hours.In between this overlong movie is filled with teases about the battle to come and the biological awakening that should have happened when the characters were 12 not 16.To help disarm Voldemort Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) lures out of retirement an old potions professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent). Dumbledore then sends Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) armed with a powerful potions manual handed down from someone called the Half-Blood Prince to befriend and interrogate Slughorn who taught Voldemort when the dark lord was a gifted student named Tom Riddle.The flashbacks are effectively ominous as are the scenes where sinister Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) pledges to help young evildoer Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) get Harry out of the way.But Harrys attention is already drifting. Hes taken a liking to Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) the sister of his best friend Ron (Rupert Grint). When some chocolate love potions get passed around the dorm the movie becomes ""A Midsummer Nights Dream The Next Generation."" In a wizards twist on a teen comedy Ron becomes the star of the quidditch team earning him a hot-blooded admirer (Jessie Cave) and some cold stares from the suddenly jealous Hermione (Emma Watson).As the lovestruck simpleton Grint is a joy as is scene-stealer Evanna Lynch as spacey Luna Lovegood. On the dark end of the spectrum Helena Bonham Carter provides a jolt of Joker energy as Bellatrix Lestrange and Felton has grown into a complex Draco.Stuck in the middle is the overshadowed Radcliffe as Harrys heroism is on hold until the next movie. While his tussle in a lake of wraith-like creatures is sort of scary the damage done in his long-awaited battle with Malfoy is nothing that cant be fixed with some stain remover and the death of one of Harrys closest friends fails to stir real emotions. This film is rated PG a retreat from the previous two which seemed to embrace and challenge an audience that was growing up. Now the actors are growing older than the characters while the filmmakers are going in reverse as if to cover all their bases before the two-part finale of ""The Deathly Hallows.""""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" has moments of fizz and kick but tinkering with the magic formula has produced a movie thats lukewarm.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceTwo and a half stars (out of four)  Rated PG  Run time 233  Content Scary images some violence and sensuality Tags Harry Potter Harry Potter And The Half-blood Prince J.k.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The sixth Harry Potter movie is essentially a film in limbo. It begins with a wordless shot of Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) still reeling in emotional agony from the events of the last movie and ends on a miserable moment with no sense of hope or of a plan for the future. Those two anguished sequences set the tone for a fantasy-franchise installment thats more about atmosphere than story; between them many things happen but only the last 20 minutes or so have real repercussions. The rest is buildup backstory and plot sidebars signifying nothing but its mighty artful nothing in which beautifully designed and composed shots and a relentlessly ominous mood give a surprising weight to adolescent love affairs and an exceedingly minor mystery. To the degree that Half-Blood Prince has a plot rather than a series of milestones in the vast eight-film arc set to conclude in 2011 (the last book will be split into two films) it revolves around teen wizard Harry Potter trying to pry key information about his evil arch-nemesis Voldemort out of meek self-serving magic teacher Jim Broadbent. Simultaneously Harry tries to deduce the identity of ""the half-blood prince"" who used to own his old textbook and various romantic developments absorb his friends Ron Hermione and Ginny. Familiar characters pop in and out for cameos and the film even finds time for Quidditch though director David Yates (who helmed the last series installment and will tackle the last two as well) finds ways to make even a silly made-up sport played on flying broomsticks look grim and melancholy. But the films real focus is on the evolving sense of dread taking over Harrys world for reasons barely seen at all in the film. And all this creeps forward at a remarkably unhurried deliberate pace the antithesis of the series opening films with their giddy roller-coaster feel and ""Whee Magic"" theme. It takes a significant amount of investment in the Harry Potter world to make Half-Blood Prince relevant let alone sensible; the film makes no concession to newbies and thankfully spends virtually no time reiterating points already covered in previous installments. But those already involved will find that the series has matured much as the books did. This is the darkest saddest most sophisticated Harry Potter film yet.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor July 14 2009 Save for later Saved In this image released by Warner Bros. Emma Watson center Daniel Radcliffe right and Rupert Grint are shown in a scene from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Jaap Buitendjik/ Warner Bros./ AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of In ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" the sixth cinematic installment in the ""Potter"" series Harry and his Hogwarts cohorts face the most fearsome adversary of all - adolescence. Or to be more exact adolescent romance. Theres no potion strong enough to cure it.Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is warming up to Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright); her brother Ron (Rupert Grint) is besieged by Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave) whose ardor resembles commando raids. This does not sit well with Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) who fumes with jealousy as only she can fume.It was inevitable that the ""Half-Blood Prince"" would involve itself in more Muggle-ish matters as teen romance. The lead actors in these films have grown up before our eyes and their acting has grown up too. Theres something inherently funny about the romantic predicament of Harry and Ron and Hermione. As if it wasnt bad enough having to deal with the Dark Lord and the Death Eaters and all the rest now they have to square off against... raging hormones. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? ""Half-Blood Prince"" is in every way superior to its immediate predecessor ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" which like this film was directed by David Yates. Maybe he just felt more comfortable this time around dealing with kids whose emotions were rampagingly human. Hes good with the other stuff too - the sinister elements without which ""Harry Potter"" wouldnt be ""Harry Potter."" But even here the malevolence is more human-scaled. Hogwarts seems more solidly medieval less like a fairy-tale aerie. The Quidditch match a ""Potter"" mainstay is more rough-and-tumble. (Can Manchester United be recruited for the series finale?) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince The relationship between Harry and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) also gains from the age progression. Yates and his screenwriter Steve Kloves (who has written all but the last of the ""Potter"" films) capture the ways in which a student-mentor relationship can evolve into a kind of odd equality. When Dumbledore says to Harry ""Once again I must ask too much of you"" his words have a mournful gravitas. By drawing Harry into a final confrontation with Voldemort he knows he risks sacrificing both himself and the boy.It really helps in these situations to have first-rate actors. Gambon with his voluminous dishevelled grandeur fills the screen even when he is filmed from afar. In his own antic way so does Jim Broadbent making his first appearance in the ""Potter"" series as Horace Slughorn the former Hogwarts potions professor who is recruited by Harry and Dumbledore because of revelations about Voldemorts past. Slughorn is a frazzled dandy in tweeds and bow ties. His association with Voldemort whom he knew and taught years ago as the student Tom Riddle is both a source of pride and anguish to him. Broadbents performance makes us aware yet again how Dickens-like J.K. Rowlings ""Harry Potter"" books can be (starting with the names of the characters). The ""Potter"" movies in general and ""Half-Blood Prince"" in particular are at their most engaging when the characters are giddily or grotesquely outsized. Has there ever been a better villain in basic black than Alan Rickmans Severus Snape?As is true of the other ""Potter"" films this one at 153 minutes suffers from an overload of exposition and some of it feels like marking time until the next and final installment ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" (which will be released in two parts in summers 2010 and 2011). But as megamovie franchises go ""Harry Potter"" is disporting itself far better than most. If youre a repeat viewer you might want to wait to see ""Half-Blood Prince"" again on July 29 when it goes IMAX. Outsize characters were made for outsize screens. Grade B+ (Rated PG for scary images some violence language and mild sensuality.)

"Harry Potter film loses some youthful magic | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesHarry Potter film loses some youthful magicHormones race but the magic mainly idles in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince  a stage-setting film in which boyish fascinations give way to manly concerns.Emma Watson centrE Daniel Radcliffe right and Rupert Grint are shown in a scene from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  (AP / WARNER BROS.)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. July 14 2009Starring Daniel Radcliffe Michael Gambon Jim Broadbent Emma Watson Rupert Grint Alan Rickman Tom Felton Helena Bonham Carter and Maggie Smith. Directed by David Yates. 151 minutes. At major theatres. PGHormones race but the magic mainly idles in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince a stage-setting film in which boyish fascinations give way to manly concerns.The sixth Harry Potter movie and the last to exactly track J.K. Rowlings book series (the seventh and final novel will be split into two films) is at once more realistic and less wondrous.Gone are many of the whimsical fantasy elements that have made the series such a delight. The boys and girls have grown into young men and women leading to serious romantic entanglements and attendant jealousies.There is still magic but it all has dramatic purpose - and much of it points to the final two films in which youthful wizard Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his nemesis Voldemort the Dark Lord will engage in decisive battle.Article Continued BelowEmboldened by his impending return Voldemorts airborne henchthingies the Death Eaters have stepped up their attacks including muggles (humans) amongst their prey. An early scene resembling a terrorist attack sees pedestrians on Londons Millennium Bridge sprinting for safety as the Death Eaters ravage the structure.Not even such heavenly preserves as Diagon Alley and Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry are safe from Voldemorts minions who now include a fully engaged Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) who considers himself the Dark Lords opposite to Harrys status as the ""Chosen One"" among wizards.The annual train journey to Hogwarts in which Harry and pals Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) head for the start of their sixth year takes a violent turn as well-meaning subterfuge leads to a brutal beating. The students arrive at Hogwarts to discover they must now pass through a metal detector since repeated Death Eater attacks against the school have forced the need for greater security.Storm clouds real and metaphorical hover over the proceedings which returning director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves have fashioned as more of a mystery than previous instalments and with many more plot threads.The picture begins as an adult detective story as Hogwarts patriarch Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) whisks Harry from a sexy muggle encounter (what a trip that would have been) back into the fantasy realm to investigate what appears to be a savage Death Eater attack. ""Wands out Harry"" Dumbledore warns. But its a set-up to meet an important new character in the franchise Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent perfectly cast) a former professor of potions at Hogwarts who taught Tom Riddle (played by Hero Fiennes-Tiffen and Frank Dillane at different ages) the troubled student who became Lord Voldemort.Dumbledore convinces Slughorn to return to Hogwarts hoping that Harry - whom Slughorn is star-struck by - can cajole or con him into giving up important information about Riddle that could lead to Voldermorts undoing.Harry is now Dumbledores adult sidekick rather than his boyish protege an important development in the saga. But its frustrating to see Radcliffe still playing more boy than man when the time comes for Harry to whip out his wand. Youd think that five years of training would have made him less of a fumbler.There are many more developments in the tale including further elucidation into the puzzling motives of Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) now promoted to teacher of defence against the dark arts. Hes obviously being primed for greater revelations to come as is Voldemorts female consort Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) whose violent urges take a fiery turn this time.Also firming up are relations between Ron and his secret admirer Hermione amusingly complicated by male and female interlopers and between Harry and his own covert devotee Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright). Could one of Slughorns concoctions be Love Potion No. 9?Yates and Kloves have done a commendable job of distilling the essence of Rowlings mammoth text and maintaining control over plot complications (including the identity of the titular Half-Blood Prince) that could befuddle anyone not fully versed in Potter lore. Quality remains high in every regard and the cast is almost entirely intact rare feats for a franchise this far into its run.Rowling and her dutiful film deputies have kept pace with their core audience most of whom are now into their late teens and 20s and who are facing some of the same life issues as Harry and his career albeit more of the earthbound variety. The same Potterphiles who went with their parents to see the film series debut in 2001 are now old enough to attend tonights midnight screenings on their own or with their pals.Yet despite the many pluses of The Half-Blood Prince its unlikely to become a series favourite for many people at least in the celluloid format. Harrys development as a wizard and as a hero remains gallingly slow - he often gapes rather than reacts - and the storys one major development is bizarrely treated almost as an after-thought. Think of the film as a stepping-stone to greater drama to come much like The Two Towers in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and heed Slughorns words of caution ""These are mad times we live in mad"" The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr A- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Genre Sci-fi and Fantasy Drama; Starring Rupert Grint Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Helena Bonham Carter Alan Rickman; Director David Yates; Author Steven Kloves; Release Date Wide 07/15/2009; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 15 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT Darkness is visible from the outset of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. The Death Eaters mobilized by the return of Lord Voldemort at the end of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix are on the loose in London streaking through an anxious metropolis on missions of urban destruction that in a different fantasy cosmos might challenge the talents of Batman. Thunder rattles a gray sky; the camera alights on a heavyhearted young man reading his newspaper in a sad subway cafe out of an old Edward Hopper painting while he ogles a pretty waitress out of modern multiracial England. Yet theres cause for audience spirits to be high The universally recognizable fellow is Harry Potter embodied in blossoming manhood by Daniel Radcliffe. The newspaper is The Daily Prophet that model of innovative print journalism in which every photo not only tells a story but morphs into a moving picture too. And its abundantly clear that director David Yates returning to the magical realm after Order of the Phoenix and indispensable Potter screenwriter Steve Kloves (hes written all but the Phoenix script) have perfected a crucial potion Theyve found just the right balance of timeless spiritual profundity and contemporary teen specificity of awe and humor necessary to steer J.K. Rowlings ? enthralling seven-book saga to a satisfying conclusion. Will Hermione (Emma Watson) attract Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint)? Will Ron kiss flouncy pouncy Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave)? Will Harry connect with Rons no-longer-such-a-kid sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright)? And will good triumph over evil? Stick around till Yates and Kloves final two-part Potter production scheduled for 2010 and 2011 and find out. Even loyal readers who enjoy the gift of clairvoyance may appreciate a reminder or two about the plot of Half-Blood Prince. Just before Harry is set to return to Hogwarts the star student is recruited by venerable headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) for a mission. The old wizard wants to lure the retired Potions professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent doing a juicy inside-out version of his role ? in Topsy-Turvy) back to Hogwarts to find out what the vain old goat remembers about a certain former star student named Tom Riddle. (Long story short for Muggles Riddle became Voldemort.) In the meantime Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is being groomed to do some major evil. And Prof. Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) appears to have Dracos back -- as well as the most delicious ability to. clip. his. words. All the while the teenage wizards-in-training have enough to handle just being regular teens under the spell of raging hormones. ""Excuse me I have to go and vomit"" Hermione announces with a bite worthy of Gossip Girl when she observes Ron getting all snoggy with Lavender whos one of the great lovestruck steamrollers of teen literature. And anyone who has survived 12th grade has passed a pale individualist classmate like Evanna Lynchs Luna Lovegood in the hallway or encountered an imperious dragon-lady teacher like Maggie Smiths Minerva McGonagall. On the other hand not many teens face a heros quest as daunting as the one set for Harry with a showdown scheduled for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Half-Blood Prince encompasses important plot developments involving both love and death. But the story is still and all only a pause deferring an intensely anticipated conclusion. And its in that exquisite place of action and waiting that this elegantly balanced production emerges as a model adaptation. By now as played with utmost loyalty to the cause by some of Britains most illustrious actors the supporting characters are as familiar as the population of Homer Simpsons neighborhood (and thats a great compliment). Yet with a big assist from cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel -- a Potter newbie who memorably shot Amelie and Across the Universe -- the filmmakers have found a way to refresh our eyes and enhance our appreciation for this rich amazing creation.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Ominous clouds gather in scene after scene of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Some are formed in rivulets of inky liquid memories swirling in a basin to conjure recollections from the faculty of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Baleful gray thunderheads mass over the school with deaths heads eyelessly staring at Lord Voldemorts enemies on the campus. Death Eaters spew noxious vapor trails in an electrifying attack on London scattering terrified Muggles and tearing apart the Millennium Bridge. Unlike most film series the Potter movies havent weakened along the way. The films have done justice to J.K. Rowlings complicated mythology speaking confidently to the fan base while remaining accessible to the general public. In that they surpass the ""Star Wars"" prequels the ""Matrix"" trilogy or the ""Narnia"" films. Their only serious competition in the world of fantasy series would be Peter Jacksons ""Lord of the Rings"" trio and Tolkiens text was thousands of pages shorter. The latest installment of the Potter series deals in grave matters. Harry undertakes a dangerous counterintelligence mission and there are moments of profound sadness as Someone Important dies in the struggle against the dark lord. Yet this is also a delightfully comic episode with love potions romantic rivalries and runaway hormones befuddling Harry now 17 and in his sixth year at Hogwarts. Magnificently bearded Prof. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) greets pink-cheeked Harry with ""you need a shave my friend."" The films are growing more mature along with their hero. A sure balance of powerful drama and giggly teen humor marks this as one of the best Potters yet a cauldron full of magic. As Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) enter their sixth year as trainee wizards Rowling cranks the plot into high gear. Following a devastating strike on Diagon Alley Voldemorts minions are massing for an all-out assault. Dumbledore requires Harrys help in delving into the past to locate seven magical keys that can stop the attack. The usual villains bully-boy Draco Malfoy (Tom Fenton) and Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) combine their efforts to give Harry serious trouble -- Malfoy with physical and magic attacks Snape with deliciously nasty sneers and lip-curling line readings. An ambiguous new character in the proceedings is Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) the retired Potions master who taught Tom Riddle the disturbed student who became Lord Voldemort. Harry now acting as Dumbledores adult associate rather than his youthful protege is assigned to learn from the secretive fearful Slughorn information about Riddle that can be used to defeat Voldemort. Broadbent whose character is in hiding from the creepy Death Eaters makes a brilliant entrance disguised as an overstuffed chair. Courtesy Of Warner Bros. Picture Star Tribune ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Director David Yates trims Rowlings doorstop of a book to its essentials goosing the action along briskly. Character growth is deftly sketched. Malfoy begins the story as a stock thug giving Harry a dreadful beating but he ends the film anguished over the choices he must face. Flashbacks to the cold-eyed Tom Riddle at 11 and 16 (compellingly played by Ralph Fiennes nephew Hero Fiennes-Tiffin and Frank Dillane) provide an ominous look at the villains twisted roots. As the love-bedazzled Ron Grint delivers the films standout comic performance. Watsons Hermione huffs and scowls in romantic frustration as her two childhood pals steadfastly ignore her almost-adult charms. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel shoots the supernatural world with murky beauty. Wizards wands are repeatedly shown with their lighted tips straining to dispel encroaching darkness. At the end scores of wands are lifted together their massed power pushing back the gloom. Its a promising glimpse at the two-part finale of the series just over the horizon.

(Warner Bros.) Elizabeth Weitzman Monday July 13 2009 915 PM Title Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Anyone who has read the novel on which ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is based will remember the combination of urgency awe and sadness it inspired. Only filmmakers of considerable skill could aptly represent the complex vision fashioned by author J.K. Rowling so its a relief to report that director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves - both ""Potter"" veterans - have the magic touch required. Youll certainly want to enter the fray prepared because theres no time to play catchup in this sixth installment which recovers quickly from a bumpy start. Now firmly entrenched in adolescence Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his best friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) are facing mounting challenges. Worst of all Voldemorts Death Eaters are attempting to invade Hogwarts with help from Harrys nemesis Draco Malfoy (a terrific Tom Felton). As danger builds Prof. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) sends Harry back in time to understand their enemy more clearly. Kloves had to trim Rowlings book back noticeably but once things really get going you may be too entranced by whats onscreen to worry about whats not. There are curses and Quidditch matches mysteries and menace. There is tentative love all around and there is death of the most poignant sort. (A PG-13 rating would have been more appropriate for this dark chapter.) As for the ever-impressive supporting cast neither a delightfully befuddled Jim Broadbent nor a wild-eyed Helena Bonham Carter can upstage Alan Rickman who again proves invaluable as the slithery Prof. Snape. ""You are of course wondering why I brought you here tonight"" Dumbledore says to Harry during their first trip into the past. ""Actually sir"" Harry wisely replies ""after all these years I just go with it.""

""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" conjures up some pulse-quickening stuff. Horcruxes will be discovered paralysis curses will be cast and snogs will be snogged. One primary character is finally filled in while another is stamped out. MORE Stay a Spell at These Potter Parties MORE Emma Watson Bewitches Off-Screen as Well MORE Horny Potter The movie does suffer from the same problems that plague the whole series -- normally I dumbledoze through them as the suspicious new teacher shows up the plot shuts off for several minutes of Quidditch and all problems get solved with the same old hocus-pocus. But ""HP6"" is suspenseful and artfully realized. Its a definite improvement over J.K. Rowlings dimly written and exposition-clogged book. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) recruits the latest disposable professor a slinking toady called Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) who is so upholstered of midsection that it isnt much of a stretch to disguise himself as an armchair. Dumbledore wants to unlock Slughorns secret memories which contain secrets to Voldemorts background. Potters job Befriend Slughorn and get him to spill. PHOTOS Harry Potter Romances | Child Stars Then and Now Broadbent director David Yates and the script by Steve Kloves add dimensions to Slughorn who on the page is merely a booze-addled suckup to the great and powerful (thus less qualified to be a prof than a journalist) but on screen is pathetically fragile. Draco Malfoy whom Harry repeatedly catches sneaking around being really quite sinister indeed is more interesting this time as he wrestles with his fate and with the necessity to strike innumerable dramatic poses. Actor Tom Felton has mastered this last bit. With a hank of platinum hair brushed just so across his forehead and an attire of fussed-over nattiness -- narrow-lapeled jacket over turtleneck is a favorite look - hes like a Hitler youth who took a job fronting an 80s synth-pop band. Standing on his dark ramparts surveying the swirling snow he seems equally prepared to lead a fascist army into battle or bust into ""Safety Dance."" Even better is Alan Rickmans dyspeptic Snape who is central this go-round. Rickman makes each snarly pause ring out like an aria. Still now that the crew has spent about 15 hours of screen time chasing Voldemort shouldnt things be wrapping up already? Lord V. doesnt even fight Harry in this one appearing only in flashback and even then there is no clue as to why the former Tom Riddle turned evil. Just to further inflate things we get several comic relief scenes that arent funny (Ron Weasley in love Ron Weasley dominating at Quidditch - does Ron Weasley even need to be in this story? Hermione is all the sidekick we need). A couple of action scenes and the climax are handled with a spooky quiet that almost makes up for the clanging and bashing at the end of ""HP5."" And Harrys growing interest in Rons serene sis Ginny - the anti-Hermione - leads to a nice moment. Even Hagrids funeral for his giant spider comes off as weirdly touching. You know youve got skills when you can make the audience feel for a dead bug the size of a VW Bug. The horcrux of the matter is that most of Harrys fans go for the tiresome Hogwartsian wonderfulness of everything -- books cant just be shelved they have to pirouette like chorus boys and fling themselves where they belong. The series seldom rises above such kid stuff. But with its sense of loss and its able depiction of morality at war with ambition the latest edition supplies more screen magic with less abracadabra.

"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; harry-potter-and-the-half-blood-prince ) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (United Kingdom/United States 2009) July 13 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince represents the immensely popular series first outing without the net of having new books waiting in the wings. As far as the written word is concerned Harrys tale is done. Cinematically there are still two volumes to come (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Parts 1 and 2). The critical question for the movies producers is whether Harry will be as popular now that his legions of stalwarts know how it all ends. The smart money would be on answering that question with a resounding ""yes"" Nevertheless in part because the source material for the sixth movie is inherently difficult to adapt and in part because of some questionable choices made by screenwriter Steve Kloves in terms of what should be left in and what should be cut out Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince represents the weakest chapter in the franchise since installment 2 Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. After three consecutive top-flight fantasy adventures Harry has slipped a notch. One can predict that both fans and non-fans of the books will have issues with the movie although they likely will not be the same ones. The purists who believe that the novels should be slavish adaptations of J.K. Rowlings tomes may be horrified to learn that a major aspect of The Half-Blood Prince the development of Voldemort into a more three-dimensional character via an exploration of his history is largely absent from the film. Those who havent read the book may be baffled by some things that occur with only cursory explanations and there are pacing issues. Considering how minimal the core plot is 153 minutes is too long. A significant number of scenes have apparently been included not because they are critical to events but because Kloves felt there would be a fan uprising if they were eliminated. As the story begins Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and best friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are about to begin their sixth year at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. With Harrys arch nemesis Voldemort tightening the noose around ""The Chosen One"" Harry finds his enemies are becoming more numerous and deadly. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) the schools headmaster shows Harry a selection of key memories about Voldemorts past but theres a problem - one of the memories that of Professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) discussing forbidden magic has been distorted. Dumbledore entrusts Harry with the task of befriending the professor and learning the truth of the memory because it may contain a key to how Voldemort can be defeated. Meanwhile Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) seeks revenge against Harry and Dumbledore for the defeat of his father; Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) binds himself by an unbreakable vow to Voldemorts cronies; Harry fights against a growing attraction for Rons younger sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright); and Ron and Hermione dance around their feelings for one another. The Half-Blood Prince suffers from what I call ""setup syndrome"" meaning that much of its plot and energy is devoted not to telling a self-contained story but to establishing threads that will have a payoff in a future installment. As a result theres little doubt that The Half-Blood Prince will fare better when the entire series is available. At this point however it has an incomplete unfocused feel. It is easily the least structured of the movies. Fortunately it ends with a bang both in terms of visual and emotional impact. The final half-hour is good enough to make one forgive the somewhat meandering nature of the two hours that precede it. For anyone unfamiliar with the novels some of what happens during the climax may come as a surprise. The Rowling faithful however will be interested to see whether the movie does the written word justice with these particular scenes and I can assure them that it does. The darkness that has been ever more deeply infusing the Harry Potter movies since The Prisoner of Azkaban is more palpable here than in The Order of the Phoenix. Dont worry about the PG-rating - that just means there arent any exceptionally gruesome or violent scenes. The Half-Blood Prince continues taking Harry and his friends down a path that leads deeper into the gloaming. Director David Yates style reflects this. Color is significantly desaturated throughout and there are scenes (especially those in the cave near the end) that appear almost black-and-white. When one compares the bright cheery look of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone with the starkness of The Half-Blood Prince it can be difficult to accept that the movies are part of the same series. There are some tonal issues that impede the movies stability. The light comedy associated with the Ron/Hermione/Lavender romantic triangle although faithful to the book isnt entirely successful in the movie due in part to poor integration. In the book Rowling was able to incorporate it in a way that felt natural to the characters. In the movie pretty much every scene in which Lavender appears is drenched in artifice. These sequences seem to belong in an entirely different motion picture. The intent is for them to provide comedic relief but they often strike the wrong note. The Half-Blood Prince finally gives Michael Gambon something to do as Dumbledore beyond standing around looking sage. If Ian McKellans Gandalf could be a wizard of action why not the headmaster of Hogwarts? Its not a great performance but given the strictures under which Gambon is working its probably the best he could provide. More of a standout is Alan Rickman whose interpretation of Snape this time around is a richer more rounded one. Rickman brings something of The Deathly Hallows incarnation of his character into this movie; it can be seen in Snapes eyes the way he carries himself and some of his gestures. The lead three teenagers extend what they provided in the previous installments with Daniel Radcliffe being the most polished Rupert Grint the most comedic and Emma Watson the most wooden. Bonnie Wright who has been lurking around the periphery for most of the series is a welcome addition to the spotlight if only because it would be lonely for Ron and Hermione to find each other but for Harry to be left alone. The revelation that The Deathly Hallows has been bifurcated dims the arrival of The Half-Blood Prince; it is no longer the penultimate motion picture in the saga but just another stepping stone on the way to the far bank. It is also the least self-contained of the Harry Potter movies. With the five previous productions it was possible to enjoy them as separate but interconnected adventures (although the previous outing The Order of the Phoenix demanded some knowledge of the overall mythos). That is not true of The Half-Blood Prince. It needs to be seen in context. Neophytes will become frustrated and lose their way. This will not vex Potter fans but it may annoy those who have never picked up any of Rowlings books and prefer to view the films as throwaway diversions. The sixth Harry Potter movie has its share of flaws but nevertheless represents solid entertainment and it extends a remarkable streak for a franchise that has gone six deep without one failure. Two more hits - something entirely possible with the same production team returning and a solid story as the foundation - and the Harry Potter cycle could go down as one of the most creatively rewarding long-running series of all time.

Harrys got his own love triangle falling for Rons sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright) whos dating another student.Along with a romantic rival Harry has a more dangerous foe in Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) his bullying tormentor now a torn and troubled youth himself as an agent of Voldemort.Whether Radcliffe Watson and Grints acting careers flourish after Harry Potter or not they have left an impressive little body of work with these three characters alone developing them into full-blooded youths that feel real despite their fantastical surroundings.Add to My Gulf NewsshareRssShare on facebookShare on facebookShare on twitterShare on twitterShare on google_plusone_shareAdd on google plusShare on emailSend Email to FriendMore Sharing ServicesAddthisMore from Movies Bad Moms film review Its rather conventional0529 pmBad Moms stars say the film is a necessary0527 pmPottermania awakens with new play book and film0510 pmHarry Potter play Pottermania is alive and well0510 pmRaman Raghav honoured at South Korea film fest0142 pmReunions make Black Panther personalFilm review Dishoom is a tale of clichesOprah to star in DuVernays A Wrinkle in Time filed underGulfNewsLeisureMoviesAlso In MoviesBad Moms film review Its rather conventional      Leisure Gallery   Getting snowed in peak summer at a mallShanghai tower opens fenceless skywalk      Leisure Videos    PlayTarhan Telli on custom rides3D Arabian Bubble Festival in Dubai   Follow UsMost Popular ViewedCommentedVideosMultimedia01Film review Dishoom is a tale of cliches02Anuraga Karikkin Vellam film review03Whats showing at the movies this week PlayTarhan Telli on custom ridesMay 31 2016 PlayElectric Run lights up Sharjahs streetsMar 29 2016 Play3D Arabian Bubble Festival in DubaiMay 17 2016 PlayFoodies converge at Taste of DubaiMar 13 2016 17ImagesGetting snowed in peak summer at a mallJul 29 2016 12ImagesShanghai tower opens fenceless skywalkJul 29 2016 8ImagesBollywood actress Sunny Leone on the dance floorJun 26 2016 22ImagesPictures Rajinikanth mania grips IndiaJul 22 2016Cinema ListingsMoviesWhats showing at the movies this weekGulf News Horror suspense comedy drama or apocalyptic action new movies showing in the EmiratesListingsTom CruiseInternational Monetary FundCelebrityPriyanka Chopra on why she refuses to compromise0514 pmAFPBollywood star-turned-Hollywood actress says shes a strong-willed feminist who wants to have lots of babiesSalman Khans driver asks for police protectionBollywood executive Rajjat Barjatya diesJagga Jasoos delay wont hamper fate of filmSonakshi Sinha sings for AkiraAgenda Jul 2016MonTueWedThuFriSatSun12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031Today1200 AMAbu Dhabi Summer Season 2016Today1200 AMDubai Summer SurprisesToday1200 AMFun Nationdu ForumToday0900 AMEmirates Park Zoo Summer CampEmirates Park ZooToday1000 PMModhesh World 2016Dubai World Trade Centre31 Jul1200 AMAbu Dhabi Summer Season 201631 Jul1200 AMDubai Summer Surprises31 Jul1200 AMFun Nationdu Forum31 Jul0900 AMEmirates Park Zoo Summer CampEmirates Park Zoo31 Jul1000 PMModhesh World 2016Dubai World Trade Centre01 Aug1200 AMAbu Dhabi Summer Season 201601 Aug1200 AMDubai Summer Surprises Most Popular on Gulf NewsEmirates flight delayed for nearly 2 daysEmiratisation the road ahead for private sectorGirl dies after elephant throws stone2016 UAE holidays Ejari certificates must for Dewa connectionsExplore space from Abu Dhabi desertHow Michelle Obama delivered a clincher2 sisters shot dead in Pakistan honour killingFather of Muslim soldier flays Trump CloseRecommended For YouAt least 16 killed in Texas balloon crashPUBLISHED ON Jul 30 2016,http://gulfnews.com/a-visual-spectacle-worth-the-wait-1.501374,200,harrypotterandthehalf-bloodprince25,harrypotterandthehalf-bloodprince,com/a-visual-spectacle-worth-the-wait-1
"Review Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince (movie)MOVIE REVIEW Review Harry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceAudiences are bound for adventure with a well-crafted film that is faithful to its rambunctious book and deeply attached to its actors.July 14 2009|Kenneth Turan | FILM CRITIC ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is being described as an excursion into the dark side for this venerable series but dont let the chatter fool you. Now in its sixth episode shot over an eight-year span with two more features still to come this one-of-a-kind film cycle has become as comfortable and reliable as an old shoe providing a degree of dependability thats becoming increasingly rare.As directed by David Yates who did the previous film and is on tap for the final two ""Half-Blood Prince"" demonstrates the ways that the Potter pictures have become the modern exemplars of establishment moviemaking. We dont turn to these films for thrilling or original cinema we look for a level of craft consistency and most of all fidelity to the originals -- all of which we get.Yes the Death Eaters in thrall to Lord Voldemort ""the most dangerous dark wizard of all time"" are on the march and threatening Hogwarts and all it stands for but those whove read the books know how all that plays out. Its not chills or suspense audiences are asking for here but respectful familiarity.Its only the phenomenal success of the books that has made all this possible that has ensured a loyal audience for each film an audience that has invested so much emotion not to mention time in the ongoing Potter saga that skipping an episode is out of the question. Thats a kind of brand loyalty thats all but gone out of style."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""160""gt;That investment of time also means weve been watching the films trio of youthful principals -- Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Rupert Grint as sidekick Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as brainy Hermione Granger -- grow up on screen since 2001. Theyve become as familiar as family members and ""Half-Blood Prince"" trades on that connection to keep us involved when things get slow.This bond is especially necessary in those sections of the film in which the Hogwarts gang goes through the agonies of teenage romantic attachment. Is Harry getting serious about Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright)? Will Ron be too busy with Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave) to care? Or to so much as notice that his pal Hermione is pining away just for him? Its not clear who suffers more here the kids navigating this ""High School Confidential"" universe or audiences having to endure it with them.Fortunately theres more to ""Half-Blood Prince"" than youthful heartache. Evildoers like Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) and young Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) scheme dark schemes and though Voldemort doesnt appear as an adult the film has a pair of memory flashbacks in which we see him as Tom Riddle the evilest boy who ever was.As for Harry he has serious tasks of his own to attend to. He has to help recruit faculty member Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) deal with an old textbook powerfully annotated by the mysterious Half-Blood Prince and rise to the occasion when Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) ups the ante and says to him ""Once again I must ask too much of you.""The addition of the excellent Broadbent to a cast that includes besides Gambon and Bonham Carter such fine British performers as Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane and David Thewlis underlines the Potter films ongoing status as a comprehensive guide to contemporary U.K. acting. First among equals in ""Half-Blood Prince"" is Alan Rickman as the monumentally unpleasant Professor Severus Snape dripping disdain when he eviscerates Harry with lines like ""How grand it must be to be the chosen one.""Also helping keep things professional are screenwriter Steve Kloves returning after taking the last film off and director Yates. A veteran of British TV responsible for such highly respected fare as the original miniseries version of ""State of Play"" Yates in his second Potter film seems more comfortable with the franchise. Hes turned out to be what the series has always felt it needed a good steward of the material who is respectful of the novels but not overly reverential.As they head toward the closing episodes -- Part 1 of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" will come out in 2010 Part 2 in 2011 -- it becomes clearer and clearer that these films are a law unto themselves cozy tales told around a cinematic campfire that have managed to reach out to the world."");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt;--kenneth.turanlatimes.com--Harry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceMPAA rating PG for scary images some violence language and mild sensualityRunning time 2 hours 33 minutesPlaying In general release"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""649"" height=""110""gt; MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHarry Potter ready to reset box-office records...July 15 2009DVD slump might weaken Half-Blood Prince salesJune 22 2009Harrys back and children must be braveJuly 16 2005"");document.close();})(); frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" width=""300"" height=""250""gt;MORE STORIES ABOUTHarry Potter And The Half Blood Prince (movie)Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/reviews/movies/la-et-potter14-2009jul14,0,1421215.story",200,harrypotterandthehalf-bloodprince26,harrypotterandthehalf-bloodprince,latimes

David Yates has grown more assured in his direction since his last film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. In this sixth film in the series the cinematography is stunning and the story unfolds in a stately and unhurried fashion. TRAILER Check out Half-Blood Prince Captivating from the first frame this Potter feels more epic than previous films which had a less mature more madcap quality. Yates finds an artful way to meld the teenage romance and inherent humor with a sense of impending doom. Half-Blood Prince conveys some of the rich texture and depth of J.K. Rowlings book but it takes a lackluster turn at the end. In a key scene Harry is rendered more ineffectual than his literary counterpart as a result of plot revisions. Presumably Yates decided on a less-is-more finale by underplaying the books climactic tragedy perhaps because readers already had been rocked by the event. Though this makes sense it leaves the die-hard fan with a sense of anticlimax. Yates clearly has a vision for the films and he has sharpened it with this incarnation. The somber mood suits the storys dark tone. We see less random magic and more mature reflection which is rare for a fantasy. The entire film is shot through with a sense of gravity and portent. The wizards are now 16 in their penultimate year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Though he is seen only through others memories Lord Voldemorts ominous presence is distinctly felt. He has assembled a cadre of malevolent henchmen who menace the wizarding and Muggle (non-magical) worlds. Hogwarts is no longer the refuge it had been for Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). Meanwhile the surly Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is skulking off in the schools cavernous corridors struggling with a terrible mission. Harry works with Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to thwart Voldemort and the encroachment of his evil dominion. Dumbledore assigns his protege to cozy up to Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) and access a key memory to aid in his fight. Though Half-Blood Prince is one of the seriess best with spectacular effects nuanced performances and witty dialogue its dialed-down adaptation of Rowlings conclusion ends what might have been a masterful work with a measure of disappointment.

This StoryMovies Bewitched Bewildered and Hot and BotheredHarry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceHarry Potter Takes New YorkFor a First Hogwarts Kiss a Tough Act to FollowSummer Movie Guide 2009Find Showtimes Buy TicketsDiscuss Favorite Potter MovieView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Its hard to blame ""Half-Blood Prince"" screenwriter Steve Kloves or director David Yates for focusing on the romance. After all as young-adult adventures go the sixth book in the Harry Potter series is awfully light on the adventure offering only one action sequence at the end of its exposition-packed 652 pages. It must have seemed a daunting challenge to adapt for an audience of casual moviegoers who dont know a quaffle from a bezoar. The films sacrifice of Horcruxes in favor of hormones yields some comic highlights The three leads Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione) give their most charming performances to date. Ron is particularly funny under the addling effects of a love potion and Hermione is sad and sweet in a moment of romantic disillusionment sitting at the bottom of a set of stone stairs conjuring a flock of twittering birds to circle above her head. All of which is to say that ""Half-Blood Prince"" with its romantic triangle (square? pentagon?) its Quidditch high jinks its gorgeous production design and its bang-up final action sequence might be the most enjoyable Harry Potter movie yet for people who dont particularly care about Harry Potter movies. Whether die-hard fans of the books will love it though is another story. Count me as one Potterphile who wasnt enchanted. My problems with ""Half-Blood Prince"" dont feel like the kinds of quibbles that franchise fanatics often raise. Im not upset about Hermiones hair or the excising of a minor character. While in my heart of hearts I imagine the perfect Potter adaptation as a 30-hour miniseries in which every scene in the book is reproduced verbatim Im willing to accept that Hollywood adaptation is the art of omission and collage. A screenwriter struggles to excise everything nonessential from a book and then assembles the rest into a shape thats pleasing to the eye. But while previous Harry Potter movies have ranged in quality each has managed at least to convey the basic spirit of the novel from which it was adapted from 2001s ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" which got across the wonder Harry feels at his new magical life to 2007s ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" which effectively outlined the growing political intrigue and rebellious fervor that drives the fifth book. Alas ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" though not without its excellent moments doesnt tell the two stories that at heart the book tells. It doesnt present a compelling portrait of the birth life and descent into inhumanity of the villain who has haunted this series from its opening scenes Voldemort. And it doesnt make the budding romance between Harry and Ginny feel inevitable and true. Theres still plenty of magic in ""Half-Blood Prince."" Jim Broadbent is the latest in the long line of beloved British actors to finance a country home through an effortlessly wry performance in a Potter film. New Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn is an avid collector of talented and famous students -- the kind of influence-peddling prof who loves to brag about the connections and accomplishments of his charges. Director Yates brings the same energy and grit to ""Half-Blood Prince"" that he did to its predecessor and though hes no Alfonso CuarA3n -- the auteur whose 2004 ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" remains the on-screen pinnacle of Potter -- he shares CuarA3ns delight in the creation of a believably magical world. And Yatess cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (""AmA(c)lie"") has certainly shot the most lovely of the Harry Potter films. Hogwarts has never looked more ravishing as a reflective Harry acknowledges at the movies close while the trio prepare to say goodbye to the school that has molded their characters for six eventful years. The ways in which ""Half-Blood Prince"" failed to satisfy me and the ways it will surely satisfy many many other moviegoers are a healthy reminder that adapters of beloved stories cannot should not target the fanatics in the audience. And it suggests we fanatics might be much happier if we stopped expecting them to. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (153 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for scary images some violence language and mild sensuality. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2009 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Bewitched Bewildered and Hot and Bothered For a First Hogwarts Kiss a Tough Act to Follow Summer Movie Guide 2009 Find Showtimes Buy Tickets Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Harry Potter Takes New York Discuss Favorite Potter Movie",http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2009-07-14/news/36884166_1_lavender-brown-harry-potter-hermione,200,harrypotterandthehalf-bloodprince28,harrypotterandthehalf-bloodprince,washingtonpost

Rating More Harry Potter 7/14 Potter midnight viewings Tickets selling out for midnight showing Watson calls Rowling friend Radcliffe at home in film Grint remains the mellow man of Potter trio Overview Harry Potter films View the latest trailer The Vault of Villainy Meet the Hogwarts teachers Watch the kids grow up Thats true both literally and figuratively in the wickedly entertaining ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" At one point Professor Dumbledore tells Harry ""You need a shave my friend."" Whiskers arent the only result of the onslaught of puberty at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Hormones are starting to rage causing the usual crushes and attendant heartaches magnified by all the magic (really) in the air. But the film series is growing up as well. As with author J.K. Rowlings historically bestselling novels ""Half-Blood Prince"" is dark full of malevolence betrayal and as those who read the books know even death. For those who havent read the books or had their children relate the plot points those last bits of information will go unreported. But if the developments are not entirely unexpected then they are still effective both as intriguing storytelling and as devices to move Harry into the next installment. As the film opens Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is on the verge of an actual date. With a girl Yes. Then no. Its scuttled before it can start because Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) shows up and whisks him away to the home of Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) a former Hogwarts professor whom Dumbledore is keen on getting back. Dumbledore is gathering clues that he thinks will reveal more about the evil Lord Voldemort; Slughorn may hold a crucial key. Harry meanwhile has found an annotated book of potions that once belonged to someone who called himself the Half-Blood Prince. Neither Harry nor his pals Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) can figure out who that may be. But whoever it is he sure knows his way around a cauldron; using the footnotes Harry worms his way into Slughorns good graces. As Dumbledore goes about his deadly serious business Ron Hermione and Harry are also attending to affairs of the heart. Director David Yates is good at getting the emotional upheaval across; Hermione in particular is floored by Rons obliviousness to her affections even as he develops a make-out relationship with someone else (they use the great British term ""snog"" which sounds much more accurate in depicting the sloppy inexpert fumblings that go on here). ""Half-Blood Prince"" is a winning installment in the series for a couple of reasons. One is Yates who invests what could be a silly romp with wizards and wands with real emotion. That goes not just for the feel of the film but the look of it as well. Its dark and foreboding a sense of dread settling over everything. Yates who directed 2007s ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" and is set to direct both parts of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" takes this stuff seriously and it shows. The other treat here is the cast. Although Radcliffe Watson and Grint are all good its the older actors who really shine. Gambon is appropriately wise but hes not without humor to which his bathroom reading (?) will attest. Broadbent is excellent as the absent-minded conflicted Slughorn. Helena Bonham Carter plays the character with the best name in the entire series - Bellatrix Lestrange - as a sort of punk-rock freak. Its great fun. Best of all is Alan Rickman as Severus Snape. The obvious relish with which he delivers his lines - a pause here a dose of malevolence there so thick it practically drips from his mouth - is fantastic to watch (and to hear). ""Half-Blood Prince"" is plenty good in its own right as a stand-alone piece of entertainment. But it also serves the series well delivering on perhaps its most-important requirement It makes you really want to see the next one. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

He Who Must Not Be Named is and causes a bit of trouble. Ron provides comic relief Hermione irrefutable logic and Harry steadfast heroics. Yet this ""Harry Potter"" film feels different. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (PG) Warner Bros. (153 min.) Directed by David Yates. With Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint. Opens Tuesday at midnight in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO AND A HALF STARS Rating note The film contains a few scary monsters and some teenage ""snogging."" The beginning is a bit rushed. The ending is a slight letdown. And the middle -- while still full of invisibility cloaks love potions and magic wardrobes -- is more emotional than magical with each of our three leads struggling with schoolyard romances. Whats going on here? Well whats really happening in ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a preparation for whats about to happen -- the end of the series which will conclude over the next couple of years with the two-part ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows."" But before that can begin author J.K. Rowling and the blockbusters based on her books have to get all their owls in a row. So theres some crucial plot development (as Harry returns to Hogwarts for a sixth year and a job figuring out a mystery from Voldemorts student days). A lot of time is spent setting up relationships that will play out later. And it ends in -- well in the middle of things. For more coverage of ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" visit http//www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/07/harry_potter_and_the_halfblood.html Its a familiar situation for genre fans who are used to seeing the penultimate film in a series spend precious time preparing the way for the climax. Sometimes this can provide a dark change of pace (""The Empire Strikes Back""). Sometimes it can feel like a bit of marking time (""The Matrix Reloaded""). ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" is a bit of both. On the one hand there are some significant moments if you know the series. And if you dont I wont include any spoilers here -- except to say that Harry assumes more of a leadership role than ever and that Voldemorts past reveals a crucial vulnerability. These are important and satisfying character developments for hard-core fans too and they will enjoy seeing Draco showing some stirrings of guilt Dumbledore regretting the burdens hes asked Harry to bear and Snapes twisted plan as it finally emerges from the shadows. Alan Rickman is as always a deliciously dour presence as the former Potions professor (now getting a chance to teach Defense Against the Dark Arts). And the great Jim Broadbent is a lovely addition as a back-from-retirement educator the shallow Horace Slughorn. Our three favorite students are back too with Daniel Radcliffes Harry a slightly less angry teen than in ""The Order of the Phoenix."" Emma Watsons coolly practical Hermione finally lets her guard down a bit and shows some usually well-hidden anxieties. On the other hand if youre only a casual fan this 21/2-hour film is going to feel padded. The romantic subplots are repetitive. (And the sex appeal of Ron Weasley remains lost on me at least.) And the ending is as anticlimactic as a big ""To Be Continued"" title. Visually yes this is another solid ""Harry Potter"" entry with the same impressive sets and effects. But it also badly misses the presence of a new or at least formidable villain. While its great to see Helena Bonham Carters punkish Bellatrix Lestrange again Voldemort is reduced to a cloud formation and there are few real scares. Some of that will probably be blamed on the new child-friendly rating (the last two episodes were PG-13). But ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was only PG too and it was the best of the series with a werewolf Dementors Sirius Black and a fast-moving plot. Things have slowed down a bit here. (""Prince"" is the second longest episode so far.) The good news? Millions of devoted fans will love it despite that change of pace (some even because of it). And everyone else can take comfort in knowing that its only the necessary lull before the storm and thunder of this beloved series inevitable bittersweet conclusion.

Pictures fantasy adventure ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" <<12>>All About Harry Potter Harry Potter special section ""Harry Potter"" trailers Slide Show ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" Showtimes It has been four years since ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" was published two years since the last Harry Potter film (""Order of the Phoenix"") opened and two years since the final book in the series ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" hit stores. So even some devoted J.K. Rowling followers feared that the film version of ""Half-Blood Prince"" would seem stale especially since most Muggles now know precisely how the epic series ends. Instead ""Half-Blood Prince"" ranks as the best of the Potter movies after Alfonso Cuarons dark take on ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and the most compelling in terms of exploring honest emotions. While the special effects are even more dazzling than in the earlier films (the Quidditch scenes in particular have come a long way since the first one) the emphasis here is on the characters and relationships making ""Half-Blood Prince"" deeply human.Fans of the books should be advised that writer Steve Kloves who scripted four of the previous five films and director David Yates even more comfortable here than on ""Order of the Phoenix"" have taken liberties with Rowlings text. Notable scenes -- from the meeting of the Minister of Magic with the Muggles prime minister at the beginning to the funeral of Professor Dumbledore at the end -- have been eliminated. So have some subplots (the romance of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour) and characters (the new minister of magic Rufus Scrimgeour wont pop up until ""Deathly Hallows""). And some scenes have been altered from the book or added.Advertisement Still Kloves and Yates are extraordinarily faithful to the emotional underpinnings of ""Half-Blood Prince"" and the evolution of its core characters -- Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) -- from tweens into mature fighters of evil. The filmmakers also have captured the raging teen hormones portrayed in the book as Hermione/Ron and Harry/Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) become couples.Kloves pared-down telling of Rowlings tale works beautifully. An attack by Lord Voldemorts evil forces on the Muggle world makes for a spectacular opening and then flows seamlessly into Dumbledores (Michael Gambon) recruitment of Harry to persuade former Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to return to the school. Slughorn possesses something Dumbledore needs to thwart the plans of Voldemort making the Broadbent character the focal point of the story and giving the actor a chance to almost steal the movie. He gets considerable competition from Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and a bit from Tom Felton who expands his emotional range as Harrys nemesis Draco Malfoy.But perhaps because fans know in advance where the story is going to a deadly confrontation on the turrets of Hogwarts a genuine sense of dread permeates ""Half-Blood Prince."" Even when the movie dances lightly and sometimes amusingly through the romances of the Hogwarts students you can feel the darkness closing in on their world and anticipate the sacrifices that must be made to halt Voldemorts reign of terror.Yet all the atmosphere Yates creates on the screen wouldnt matter if we didnt care so deeply about the central characters who have grown up before our eyes. Radcliffe Watson and Grint have never been better individually or as a group than in ""Half-Blood Prince."" Over six films they have become increasingly comfortable and have matured as actors. In particular there is a lovely nuanced scene in which Hermione is shaken with jealousy by Rons new girlfriend and Harry comforts her. Yates wisely lets the easygoing interaction of these three shine through giving the film a solid dramatic base. With the whole cast Kloves and Yates back for the final two films -- ""Deathly Hallows"" proved too complex to be adapted as a single movie -- ""Half-Blood Prince"" shows the Potter film franchise and Rowlings story are in very good hands indeed.Contact Charlie McCollum at 408-920-5245.""Harry Potterand the Half-Blood Prince""HH 1/2Rating PG (for scary images some violence language and mild sensuality)Cast Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Rupert Grint Michael Gambon Alan Rickman Jim Broadbent and Maggie SmithRunning time 2 hours 33 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES A Game of Thrones spin-off?

And indeed in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince puberty is in full bloom addled adolescence all the rage.Slower and talkier than the five Potters that came before - but not necessarily in a bad way - Half-Blood Prince is a bubbling cauldron of hormonal angst rife with romance and heartbreak jealousy and longing.If it werent for all the bearded wizards and whooshing Death Eater vapor trails this could be just another modern-day high school melodrama. Whos taking whom to the prom? And how can So-and-So be in love with that bimbo?One big difference between Half-Blood Prince and say I Love You Beth Cooper (a terrible teen comedy but one directed by Chris Columbus the man behind the first two Harry Potters) Instead of exclaiming ""Omigod"" at every shocking turn the phrase of choice for aghastness and surprise is ""Merlins beard""David Yates director of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) returns bringing a steady hand and a subtle playfulness to the proceedings. This isnt up there with Alfonso CuarA3ns The Prisoner of Azkaban (the third the darkest and still the best of the Potter adaptations) but its lack of pretense and quiet celebration of J.K. Rowlings iconography imbues it with charm.As the story begins Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is slumming with Muggles in London flirting with a waitress in a cafe (she recognizes him from the photo in the newspaper under the headline ""Harry Potter - the Chosen One?"") and promising to meet up with her after work. Harry you rascal you.But Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has an assignment for the lad with the lightning scar on his forehead plucking Harry from a tube station platform and flying off to a cozy country village where a retired Hogwarts professor Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) is in hiding.An expert on potions and a teacher with a serious Voldemort connection Professor Slughorn is needed back at the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in order to fulfill a fateful obligation. And Harry and Dumbledore are there to negotiate his return.Millions of Rowling readers will come to The Half-Blood Prince fully aware of the plot permutations and character conflicts in the book series penultimate installment. (The final volume HP and the Deathly Hallows will be split into two films.) Hermione (Emma Watson) finds herself bristling and agitated when Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) shows interest in another girl Lavender Brown (Jessie Cave). Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is once again up to no good - conspiring with Professor Snape (Alan Rickman master of the dramatic pause) on a mission of epic evil. And the romance between Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) and Harry burgeons.The magic of the Harry Potter films is twofold. Hogwarts world of horrific hexes and ricocheting Quidditch balls is presented in artful detail - the ancient books the cathedral-like dining hall the (yes) dragon tartare hors doeuvres - but theres a disarming matter-of-factness about it all too. Hexes and spells and Dark Arts yeah so what else is new?And having grown up on screen from pipsqueaks back in 2001s inaugural to the almost-adults they are today Radcliffe Watson and Grint evince a rapport and chemistry that feels authentic.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince for all its dire turns and bewitching intrigues has a sense of normalcy and continuity about it - Harry Hermione and Ron seem like very old friends at this point even if theyre still quite young.Young and in love.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

"Movie review Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -- 4 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic A great treachery is revealed a great light is snuffed out and the final quest is set up in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince an emotional and involving installment in the hit-or-miss Harry movie series.Its a film of gloom fear and dread -- and were not just talking about the teen romance. A great cast is given a little room to breathe and act something the weakest films in this planned octology have been lacking. The result is a satisfying film just coherent enough just engrossing enough to cover for the tedious by-the-book slog of even the best Harry Potter films. In year six  Harry is summoned back to Hogwarts School to get to know a new-old teacher Potions Professor Horace Slughorn whos given a Dickensian twinkle by Oscar winner Jim Broadbent. Head master Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is closing in he thinks on the evil Lord Voldemort whose Death Eaters are brazenly messing with wizard and Muggle alike. Slughorn may be of some use.But Harrys task is made trickier by those Harry hormones. If hes not flirting with waitresses hes mooning over the Girl Next Door or watching his best mate Ron (Rupert Grint funny as always) almost blow it the with out-of-his-league Hermione (plucky Emma Watson). ""The Chosen One"" isnt lacking for confidence. He recklessly hurls himself into tussles. And he learns from the battered copy of Advanced Potions a book with the name ""Half-Blood Prince"" scribbled on the inside cover.Director David Yates who did the fine BBC version of State of Play before muddling into Potter World with the last film seems to find more of his footing here. Half-Blood Prince was supposed to come out last winter but was pulled for bottom-line reasons. The delay shows in the films sharper cutting though as always its still a half-hour too long. Some of us dream of a fast-paced Potter that skips the obligatory Quidditch match.The film gives Broadbent several nice scenes some of them flashbacks. But it also is the first film to let Maggie Smith earn her pay to not saddle Robbie Coltrane with wizardly exposition and digital critters galore. Gambon brings out Dumbledores humanity. And Alan Rickman has more occasions to wrap his voice around the plummy vowels of Severus Snape with a Christopher Walken relish.""How grand it must beeeee"" Snape purrs ""to be The Chosen One. "" Potter fans can lose themselves in the honey-glow interiors and Christmas-card landscapes and grin over the butter beer busts and snogging sessions of these typical wizardly teens. And casual fan or hardcore Muggle Half-Blood Prince lets us see that the ends within reach and that with luck and attention to tone and character this eight-film series (theyre splitting the last book into two movies) will go out with a flash and not a fizzle.See for yourselfHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince4 out of 5 starsCast Daniel Radcliffe Emma Watson Michael Gambon Alan Rickman.Director David YatesRunning time 2 hours 23 minutesIndustry rating PG for scary images some violence language and mild sensuality.

""At times I still see the small boy from the cupboard"" he says marveling at how much the lads grown. Doesnt everyone. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) have come a long way since Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone when the bespectacled orphan with the lightning scar first confronted He Who Must Not Be Named (And Isnt Even In The Sixth Movie Except As A Kid). The last film ended with a fiery showdown in the Ministry of Magic where Harry witnessed the death of his godfather and discovered the prophecy that dubs him ""the chosen one."" Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince the sixth adaptation of J.K. Rowlings blockbuster series finds the anointed Potter with his usual band of friends bookish Hermione (Emma Watson) loyal Ron (Rupert Grint) and Rons spunky kid sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright). Rampaging Death Eaters those unleashed minions of the Dark Lord are terrorizing muggles and wizards alike. The despicable Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) is sneaking around on some no-good mission. Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) the new potions professor is a batty sycophant. And Rons new girlfriend (Jessie Cave) is a borderline-psycho snogging machine. Directed by David Yates (who also helmed the fifth one Order of the Phoenix) from a screenplay by Steve Kloves (who wrote the first four) this new Harry is the sharpest since The Prisoner of Azkaban. It is the most emotionally satisfying of them all blending spot-on comedy and adenoidal sexual tension (Hermione pines for Ron Harry pines for Ginny) with scenes of gutsy vulnerability. So many actors shine in so many ways Carter hisses deliciously Broadbent sucks up beautifully. Watson shudders with frustration and heartbreak Felton shudders with anger and fear. Gambon does as Gambon will -- he wears his righteousness lightly his baritone teasing out equal parts humor and gravitas. As for Radcliffe he does a buzzed-on-potion routine thats truly no exaggeration the single funniest sequence in all six movies. When its over he switches gears and delivers an impassioned speech to the dithering Slughorn that pings with grief and virtue. In appearance and tone Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is much more stylishly gothic than the earlier films. It oozes doom. Violins shimmer dissonantly; storm clouds gather ominously; Hogwarts for once looks like the gray and forbidding castle it always was. In appearance and tone Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is much more stylishly gothic than the earlier films. It oozes doom. Violins shimmer dissonantly; storm clouds gather ominously; Hogwarts for once looks like the gray and forbidding castle it always was. This is the second PG-rated movie this year after the exquisite Coraline that spooks and creeps like classic horror with only a lick (actually a kick) of conventional violence. Yet those whove read the book already know the ending and it isnt happy. Neither are those writhing ""inferi"" -- pasty little corpses activated by dark magic -- who lurk underwater like the condemned in Dantes Inferno. This is dark difficult stuff; it only gets darker in the sagas seventh and final chapter to be split into two separate films. For readers the single greatest satisfaction of the Harry Potter saga is the chance to follow beloved young characters as they grow up fall down and rise to meet their destinies. For movie goers theres added satisfaction in the maturation of the cast itself -- in the way theyve stretched themselves literally and figuratively to embody all that Rowlings universe demands. ""The small boy from the cupboard"" has become a bright-eyed warrior a youth who comprehends his own fate and pursues it like all true heroes with doughtiness and wit. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Wide-Ruled 70-Sheet Spiral-Bound Notebook for 17 cents +...

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review A Ripping Yarn The latest Harry Potter is thrilling and chilling. Plus the sparkling cold (500) Days of Summer. _ By David Edelstein Published Jul 13 2009 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Warner Bros. Pictures) Now that we know how the saga ends (with a ho and a hum) Harry Potter feels so 2008. Kids who started reading J.K. Rowling prepubertally (He and Cho Chang snog? No way) have since moved on to Mormon sexual-repression parables involving vampires while Little Harry got naked on Broadway and blinded six horses with a metal spike. Undaunted Warner announced it would prolong its franchise by splitting the underplotted final book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows into two movies. (If they split the second part of that and keep splitting the series could go on to infinity.) As tag teams of agents and executives labor to convince Dame J.K. that the world desperately needs prequels (Young Dumbledore and the Temple of Doom) here comes movie No. 6 Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Do we give a damn? I didnt until the film startedand it was splendid No its not a larky kid-pic. Were firmly in the realm of English horror as one set of sallow Brits battles another even sallower. Our villains are racist murderers; our heroes embody tolerance discipline and a British public-school education heavy on Latinwhich when chanted properly behind a wand can mean the difference between goosing and defenestrating someone. As the aged Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) hears the chimes at midnight Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) Hermione (Emma Watson) Ron (Rupert Grint) and Rons newly sprouted kid sister Ginny (Bonnie Wright) struggle to keep their desires (and vindictive hexes) in check while their objects of affection snog other people. If Voldemort (present in this movie only in spirit) were a true evil genius hed have abandoned the horcrux nonsense and used their own hormones against them. Screenwriter Steve Kloveswho adapted earlier Potter tomes with excessive reverencesat out part five and is in fighting form cutting a droll path through Rowlings verbiage. Apart from the fact that no one who hasnt seen parts one through five will have a clue whats going on this barely feels like a sequel. Director David Yates creates Orson Wellesish multiple levels of action and when the camera sails around Hogwarts turrets its as if the CGI is an extension of the wizards magic. Illustrious British actors pop in and out intoning their few lines and collecting the paychecks that underwrite their stage work (and country houses). As Professor Snape either a double or triple agent Alan Rickman hits new levels of hauteur breaking up sentences with long disdainful beats I counted five seconds between two words and Im guessing Dame Maggie Smith bit her tongue to keep from howling. Jim Broadbent shows up as the new professor Slughorn and he makes the man at once dotty and haunted the dottiness keeping his guilt at bay. Our three protagonists are taller more polished more charismaticafter all theyre movie stars now. But Emma Watsons Hermione has turned out disappointingly. Its not Watsons fault she grew up so pretty so poised with such luscious tresses. But someone ought to have reminded the filmmakers that in this boy-centric universe Hermione is the nerdy-wonky cutie with whom all girls hot and not could identify. Now shes just another cover girl. I found myself wishing for more of the washed-out blonde Evanna Lynch and her glassy singsong as the space case Luna Lovegood the last female reminder that Harry Potter began as a universe of misfits. Once upon a time screenwriter Scott Neustadter fell for a remarkably attractive but commitment-averse woman and instantly decided she was the Oneand he kept hope alive until she dumped him. He hasnt gotten over it The pain in (500) Days of Summer (written with Michael H. Weber) feels very raw. The movie directed by Marc Webb is told entirely from the point of view of Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) an aspiring architect earning a living concocting greeting-card platitudes while the love of his life Summer (Zooey Deschanel with her sexy-slurry delivery and electric-blue eyes) remains unreadable unknowable endlessly manipulative. Line by line the script is clever but its the syntax that kills. Theres a counter on the screen and the movie leaps from day 259 to 1 to 154 and back and forth until we reach 500. Starting with the breakup means we see what Tom in the moment cant Shes trouble and hes an emotional ding-a-ling. That slick SonofCharlie Kaufman stuff is enough to put (500) Days of Summer over and Levittwho moves groggily as if he sleeps all day but never deeplyis an expert enough comedian to mope without killing the pace. Theres a neat dramatic coup when Tom and Summer play house in an Ikea store and an ingenious split-screen sequence in which Expectation on the left gradually diverges from Reality on the right. But the film is finally a brilliant tap dance over a void Theres no real drama when the inner life of the female lead is so shrouded even if thats the point. Compare (500) Days to the messed-up teen comedy I Love You Beth Cooper adapted by Larry Doyle from his rollicking novel. The latter film is ploddingly directed but along the way the object of the nerd heros fantasies Beth Cooper (a lovely performance by Hayden Panettiere) acquires more and more complexity. And three dimensions however dim are more enlivening than the sparkling two of (500) Days of Summer. If you manage not to bolt in the first five minutes of Death in Lovewherein Boaz Yakin cuts back and forth between a Jewish girl having sex with a Nazi and graphic shots of Nazis performing experimental surgery on Jewsyoull be rewarded with a pretentious and stilted but weirdly compelling blend of sins-of-the-parent saga and horror movie. The torrid affair enables Mom (Jacqueline Bisset) to survive the Holocaust but she goes on to destroy her sons a con artist (Josh Lucas) with a penchant for Samp;M who victimizes women and a basket case (Lukas Haas) whos terrified of them. Really theres something here to offend everyone Its the kind of film that makes you want to shout invectives at the screen. But it also reminds you how little there is in the way of movies about how family traumas get worked out (or just acted out) in the bedroom. We need more insane artists to light the dark paths ahead.

For one Voldemorts allies the aerial ink-trailing Death Eaters are ravaging London. Ping Pling There go the stanchions of the Millennium Bridge And Harry has hardly been re-admitted to school following the departure of Mrs Umbridge last terms knit-robed Robespierre when Dumbledore teleports him to Tudor-relic Budleigh Babberton to meet and recruit one-time Potions Master Horace Slughorn (Jim Broadbent disguised as a sofa).False-memory syndrome is at the heart of this next stage of the fight against evil forces Dumbledores phials of stored reminiscences have been polluted and it is sly Slughorns recall of his past tutoring of a Horcrux-fascinated student which may hold a necessary and life-saving corrective.Longer than the last the sixth episode of the adventures of the increasingly burdened magic warrior of Privet Drive is a more human affair than its predecessors. Its as full of the romantic dalliances of the maturing students as it is of warring set-pieces creature shocks and detours down dark Dickensian alleys. We can already sense the two-part seventh and final saga on the horizon and the whole less-frenzied affair is tonally and emotionally suggestive of a post-battle re-grouping before a final cinematic assault.To this end scriptwriter Steve Kloves back after a one-film sabbatical has ably summed up the JK Rowling doorstopper by omitting a major battle and axeing at least one character. Also the fine less showy work by new DoP Bruno Delbonnel and Nicholas Hoppers non-strident second Potter score are in tune with director Yatess laudable refusal to underline too forcefully moments of triumph and disaster. Togther they allow space for as much human detail intimacy humour and indeed pathos as a family magical/fantasy action adventure will allow. Thus - thrillseekers beware - the films memorable scenes are interestingly not necessarily the most momentous the sad assembled Weasleys regarding their crooked Norfolk tower; a lionine wind-tossed Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) framed in the Hogwarts tower with all the grandeur of Powell and Pressburgers Black Narcissus; poor Emma Watsons Hermione crying in solitary heartbreak; blonde bombshell Draco Malfoy pitied in a picture of isolated evil. Rupert Grints Ron is still the leavening star - striking funny victorious poses in the seriess last game of Quidditch - but Daniel Radcliffes less self-conscious and more self-deprecating Harry runs him a close second.Click here to read our exclusive interview with Daniel Radcliffe By Wally Hammond Posted Thursday July 9 2009 Details Release details Release date Friday July 17 2009 Duration 0 mins Cast and crew Director David Yates Screenwriter Steve Kloves Cast Helena Bonham CarterEmma WatsonAlan RickmanJessie CaveRupert GrintBonnie WrightJim BroadbentMaggie SmithMichael GambonTom FeltonHelen McCroryDavid ThewlisRobbie ColtraneWarwick DavisEvanna LynchNatalia TenaJulie Walters Users say (127) 4 out of 5 stars Average User Rating3.7 / 5Rating Breakdown5 star384 star73 star102 star161 star0LiveReviews|1271 person listeningSign inWrite reviewMost helpfulMost helpfulHighest ratingLowest ratingNewestOldestLoadingundefinedNew CommentsRefreshDec 4 2010GillianFeaturedI Agree this is the worst film so far - is too extreme amp; is too far removed from the original stories which were meant to be magical and fantastic- needed more lighter moments in it - and Harry and Hermione nakedly entangled was a step too far - very very disappointingFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 20 2009laylaFeaturedboring alright but borning kinda xFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 6 2009bobbyFeaturedthe film was really good and i think u should watch itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 6 2009bobbyFeaturedthe film was really good and i think u should watch itFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 29 2009adamFeaturedThis particular Harry Potter film was excruciatingly painful for me to watch as always the book was 100x better but it clearly did not reach expectations.

The Half-Blood Prince movie was a disappointment to me compared to the book. Obviously not all story lines can be included in movies but it didnaEUR(tm)t seem like the director (even though I know he apparently did one before) or screenplay writer or somebody must not have read the books or seen the previous movies Why change it to Luna finding Harry on the train instead of Tonks? No purpose. And why on earth would you do it making the wrakspurt (?) of LunaaEUR(tm)s imagination real?? Also leaving out conversations Harry had with Dumbledore about the possible identity of most of the horcruxes seems a crucial error for the set-up of the next story Adding things to the story like burning the Burrow is horrendous. It would better-serve the story by including more of the things that actually happened Also yes Hermione in the book is frustrated to tears with RonaEUR(tm)s obtuseness but sheaEUR(tm)s not the simpering idiot she had to portray in the movie. I waited through movie for at least the climactic ending but they didnaEUR(tm)t show the battle Unbelievable Maybe people who havenaEUR(tm)t read the book will think it fine amp; others may want to see it for the sake of it. I fervently hope a different crowd makes the movies for the last book. Thank you.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 10 2009HannahFeaturedI loved this film.

The film is just about linking the last bit of the story with the next. It doesnt stand alone as a good film so if youre not a big fan and havent seen the other movies dont bother. I went with a friend whos a big big fan and even she was disappointed.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 7 2009ChristineFeaturedThis is the second HP film that David Yates has managed to ruin. If I were JK Rowling I would be mortified. The whole essence and much of the background in the books has been ignored. David Yates cannot have read the books and if he has he certainly has no love for them. How dare he think he can do better than JK? Order of the Phoenix was the longest book but the shortest film. Wheres the logic in that? In Half Blood Prince he has left out memories essential to understanding the plot Dumbledores funeral and inserted and changed other scenes so the film bears little resemblance to the book. David Yates may be OK at special effects and action scenes but has no finesse sensitivity or affection for the characters and intricacies of the books. The first two films were very faithful to the books the second two less so but still retaining the right atmosphere but the David Yates films have let down the whole series. He should have been fired after OOTP and to have him direct the remainder is nothing less than a travesty.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 6 2009LisaFeaturedi was really disappointed ( it missed soooo much out of the books and the fantastic parts in the book were made much shorter in the film. not as good as the others but effort was put in so good try David Yates----- better luck next time....FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyAug 6 2009j.yFeaturedcmon at least put some of the good bits into the film Why not put in Scrimguere the new Minister For Magic.

This is a film not a book. You cant put every scene from the novel into the movie and sometimes you have to summarise omit and take a bit of artistic licence in order to make it a tighter rounder film.

I watched the film with many friends and they all thought it was dreadful. How can a big hollywood director release something this bad. I dont seem to get why David Yates couldnt have just done the film like the book. The book was amazing and due to the task that was handed to David Yates i would have thought he would have pulled out all the stops to make this film incredible. Instead he made it shit. David its really simple just do the film like the book surely its not that difficult seen as its already written for you. I bet he probably hasnt even read the book. Because if he had he would realise that all hes set the seventh one up for is failure. In what universe would he think or the people writing the screenplay feel that they could do a better job than the author. It just shows idiotic arrogance and also indicates how low Yates IQ score must be. Looking back on the film i can make the fair statement that not one scene had been done better than it had in the book. The acting from the cast appeared almost wooden and arkward like it was a GCSE performance in front of the rest of your class. Aside from the amount of content that has been left out meaning that a miracle must happen to recover in the seventh installement my opinion is that the best scene in that whole film was when the death eaters attacked the burrow and that wasnt even in the book. What sort of statement is that. If Yates wants to be a writter then hes in the wrong proffession but before he writes hes got to learn how to read. And he should probably learn before the seventh film is released and READ THE BOOKFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 25 2009rachelFeaturedthe book is wayyyyyyyyy better but it is pretty funny..mainly for the wrong reasons though and the romantic scenes are the funniest pahhhhhhhah...its alrite though.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 25 2009madiline humfreyFeaturedit was amazing mloved it 2 bits go see it its soo gr8 and funniFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 25 2009madiline humfreyFeaturedit was amazing mloved it 2 bits go see it its soo gr8 and funniFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 25 2009adamFeaturedMan i hated it if you want to know my opinion the only film of Harry Potter worse than this is the chamber of secrets.

Kids stuff is a thing of the past in ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince."" Suddenly looking quite grown up the students at Hogwarts are forced to grapple with heavy issues of mortality memory and loss in this sixth installment in the series of bigscreen adaptations of J.K. Rowlings Potter tales. Dazzlingly well made and perhaps deliberately less fanciful than the previous entries this one is played in a mode closer to palpable life-or-death drama than any of the others and is quite effective as such. Delayed by Warner Bros. from a late 2008 release date so as to spread the wealth after ""The Dark Knight"" scored so mightily last summer this ""Prince"" is poised to follow its predecessors as one of the years two or three top-earning films. After sitting out ""The Order of the Phoenix"" screenwriter Steve Kloves happily returned to once again skillfully condense a massive book into manageable dramatic form; among many tough narrative decisions he has cut back on the violent mayhem surrounding the murderous climax and put off the introduction of Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour until the next episode. Director David Yates after a prosaic series debut on the prior film displays noticeably increased confidence here injecting more real-world grit into what began eight years ago as purest childs fantasy; messenger owls and chattering house elves have been superseded by a frank Underground tea-room flirtation school security checks and raging teenage hormones. The sets have been stripped down to reduce Hogwarts fairy-book aspects and emphasize its gray medieval character and even the obligatory Quidditch match is staged with greater attention to spatial comprehensibility than ever before. As the overarching story ramps up toward one major characters death at the end of part six and the final confrontation between Harry and archfiend Voldemort in the climactic ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" which is being shot as a two-part film this increased seriousness is all to the good. Its hard to imagine watching ""Half-Blood Prince"" as a ""Potter"" virgin without a clue as to whats come before but its a formidable entry with a heft and cinematic texture compromised only by a certain lack of dramatic modulation. With the villainess of the last picture Dolores Umbridge out of the way but the unseen Lord Voldemort in the ascendant neither London subject to a startling opening-scene Death Eater attack nor Hogwarts itself can be regarded as safe from the Dark Lords gathering storm. While Dumbledore takes Harry along to recruit former colleague Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts as new potions professor and he hopes to provide crucial revelations about Voldemort Harrys student nemesis Draco Malfoy prepares to commit a heinous crime designed to pave the way for Voldemorts comeback. While Harry remains mindful of his status as the ""Chosen One"" he is not entirely exempt from the lusts jealousies and intrigues that preoccupy his fellow teenagers as never before. While Harrys growing fondness for Rons sister Ginny is slowly developing Ron is a sitting duck for the attentions of the irrepressible Lavender Brown. But as we know the brilliant Hermione unaccountably loves the comparatively slow-witted Ron and she has only Harrys shoulder to cry on when hes not squiring space cadet Luna Lovegood. But assessing the romantic entanglements is not nearly as much fun as simply beholding the big physical changes in the young actors whose onscreen maturation will have been documented across the span of a decade when all is said and done. The biggest change since ""Phoenix"" two years ago has been registered by Tom Felton who plays Malfoy; hes now a tall stringbean in the Jimmy Stewart mold with a face thats come to resemble that of Jonathan Pryce and he towers over Daniel Radcliffes Harry who looks to be the shortest person in the cast (not true when Imelda Staunton was around). Rupert Grint as Ron has always looked a tad older than the others and continues to while showing more character. Emma Watson perennially appealing as Hermione has become a very attractive young woman and Bonnie Wrights Ginny intrigues as the sort of initial plain Jane who keeps growing on you. Joining such returning stalwarts as Michael Gambon Alan Rickman Maggie Smith Robbie Coltrane and Warwick Davis among the Hogwarts staff is Jim Broadbent who makes a terrific disguised entrance and is then simply grand as the eccentric old prof whom Harry presses for crucial insights into Voldemort; latters student incarnation as Tom Riddle is seen in two crucial memory sequences. Its this chapter in the Potter saga that obliges the always nasty but ambiguously motivated Severus Snape to show his true colors and the indispensable Rickman delivers as always with line readings that are delicacies of the infinitely mordant kind. He is periodically egged on by the insidious Bellatrix Lestrange a role Helena Bonham Carter plays with such mesmerizing abandon that one hopes the role fully pays off in the final chapter. The particulars of Dumbledores final quest with Harry could prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated although there are unlikely to be many of those in the audience at this stage. Otherwise the film is clear-headed and clean-lined; now that hes at home with the material Yates has made a ""Potter"" picture that is less desperate to please than any of its predecessors itself a sign of series maturity. Among the always outstanding production values and top-drawer visual effects special note should be made of series newcomer Bruno Delbonnels exceptionally atmospheric cinematography and Nicholas Hoopers emotionally churning score which contains only the slightest trace of John Williams original themes. After two PG-13-rated entries this one has won a PG matching the first three. At 153 minutes ""Half-Blood Prince"" is the third-longest feature in the series and seems just about right; ""Order of the Phoenix"" at 138 minutes actually felt too short.
