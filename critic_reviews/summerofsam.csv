Comments Summer of Sam Recommended 144 minutes  1999 New York City during the summer of 1977 with the Son of Sam serial killings providing a frame for (and backdrop to) the main action. This sprawling highly ambitious film adapted from a script by Michael Imperioli and Victor Colicchio is the first in which director Spike Lee concentrates almost exclusively on white characters. Among the classic films echoed here are M (the tracking of a serial killer by everyone including organized crime) the first half of Fury (the making of a lynch mob) and Lees own Do the Right Thing. Perhaps the most remarkable achievement is the lead performance of John Leguizamo as a hairdresser who epitomizes the sexual double standards the movie is designed to critique--its one of the most fascinating portraits of a proletarian lunkhead since Brando in On the Waterfront. Like most of Lees work this bites off more than it can chew but the breadth and energy are impressive. With Adrien Brody Mira Sorvino Jennifer Esposito Anthony LaPaglia Roger Guenveur Smith and Ben Gazzara.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Summer of Sam (R) Related Item ""Summer of Sam"" showtimes This Summer Not So Hot By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 2 1999 From left Adrien Brody Jennifer Esposito John Leguizamo and Mira Sorvino star in ""Summer of Sam."" (Touchstone) Director Spike Lee Cast John Leguizamo; Adrien Brody; Mira Sorvino; Jennifer Esposito; Anthony LaPaglia; Bebe Neuwirth; Patti LuPone; Ben Gazzara Running Time 2 hours 17 minutes Contains graphic shootings frequent profanity mob violence sexual activity nudity and drug use As he has protested for months Director Spike Lees ""Summer of Sam"" is not a film about David Berkowitz (the psychopath dubbed ""Son of Sam"" during a series of brutal murders 22 years ago) and thats a shame. That minor character (unglamorously played by Michael Badalucco of TVs ""The Practice"") is the most intriguing and artistically photographed ingredient in this pedestrian-looking mishmash of a movie - part soap opera part mob story part ""Saturday Night Fever"" and part ""Saturday Night Live."" Thats right the ever-surprising (and increasingly disappointing) filmmaker has managed to mine comedy (but no deeper meaning) out of tragic source material the summer of 1977 when Berkowitz who claimed his instructions to kill came from a black Labrador retriever terrorized a New York City stuck in the sweaty grip of a heat wave and plagued by blackouts and looting. Attempting to document a moment in time ""Sam"" is the story of the mostly Italian American residents of a working-class Bronx neighborhood the story of their loves and lusts and how their lives will never be the same after the events of one historic summer. Bring on the yuks The funniest sight gag (and low point of the movie) comes when the tortured killer alone and hallucinating in his filthy apartment is approached by a neighbors dog who enunciating through a jowl full of drool urges him to continue killing. I fully expected to hear ""Yo quiero Taco Bell"" next. Nothing makes for classic comedy like poking fun at schizophrenia. The inappropriate laughs aside (and the movie is rife with unintentional hilarity much of it in unnecessary sex scenes) ""Summer of Sam"" wants to be taken seriously. It focuses on two friends Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Ritchie (Adrien Brody) and the deterioration of their relationship. Some of it is due to the fear paranoia and suspicion that sets in over the hunt for Son of Sam but mostly the murders play a lurid and gratuitous backdrop to a trite melodrama about not very interesting people. Vinny is a philandering hairdresser who wears powder-blue suits of the sort favored by ""Saturday Night Fevers"" disco king Tony Manero. Hes unhappily married to waitress Dionna (Harvard grad Mira Sorvino doing her best Marisa Tomei impression). His spike-haired friend Ritchie is an aspiring rock musician for a band called Late Term Abortion and a dancer in a gay porn palace. Ritchies girlfriend Ruby (Jennifer Esposito) known as Ruby the Skank for her um generosity with sexual favors moves to Manhattan and adopts the punk lifestyle swapping her pink lipstick and big hair for torn fishnets and leather. But no ones going anywhere. In case you miss the symbolism Vinny and his greasy pals led by head goombah Joey T (Michael Rispoli) hang out on a street corner where Lee makes sure we see the sign reading ""Dead End"" in nearly every unsubtle shot. Eventually they come to believe that Ritchie is Son of Sam leading to a climactic showdown after which their lives will never be the same (did I mention that already?). The problem is not glorification of murder (as some have complained) or even lack of a plot. Plenty happens in ""Sam"" except that it happens to people about whom we dont care beans because we are never allowed inside their pompadoured heads (despite a tantalizing glimpse into Berkowitzs). All the late 70s icons are touched upon in Lees frenetic pastiche Jordache jeans ""Im with stupid"" T-shirts Studio 54 CBGB Platos Retreat the Talking Heads ""Psycho Killer"" and a strange obsession with mens low-rise bikini briefs. But these nostalgic memories are cobbled together like random images from the scrapbook of a hyperactive child. They may call to mind fond memories (writer Jimmy Breslin playing himself introduces the film as a look back at ""the good old days"") but they hardly constitute a story. Or a point. Its never quite clear what exactly Lee is trying to say until the director himself steps into the picture. Throughout the film Lee appears as a television reporter offering Greek chorus-style commentary on the proceedings. Late in the movie his perpetual Mars Blackmon smirk hidden under a fake mustache and Afro the newscaster interviews a bunch of black Bedford-Stuyvesant residents for a ""darker perspective"" on the Son of Sam case. One woman thanks God that its a white man who has been killing all these white people and not a brother (though Berkowitz hadnt even been caught yet). If theres any moral to this sorry story perhaps Lees stealth-message is it Even when its not about race it is.

A hard-driving combustible collage-like drama about a notorious serial killers traumatic effect on New York City 22 summers ago ""Summer of Sam"" is never less than absorbing but feels just a bit like yesterdays news both narratively and cinematically. As vibrant assaultive loud and in-your-face as the city itself Spike Lees long ambitious picture is rather too forcefully reminiscent of his best film ""Do the Right Thing"" in the way it attempts to stir up both the characters and the audiences simmering rage and anxiety during a sweltering summer exacerbated by adverse incidents. Although violent crime and sex are the two main subjects of the story pic is neither controversial in content nor particularly graphic but its grimness will limit B.O. to moderate levels with women likely to be particularly resistant. Lees first film with a nearly all-white and Latino cast is positioned decisively as a period piece at the outset as newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin is brought on to explain to contempo viewers that compared to the modern ""safe"" New York the story were about to see -- one of 8 million in the Naked City -- is about ""a different time and a different place."" In short order a hulking figure is seen trudging through the night and shooting two couples in two different cars marking what are soon revealed to be the killers sixth and seventh murders. The killing spree is taking place in the Bronx and the many largely Italian characters are brought onstage with relative dispatch. Vinny and Dionna (John Leguizamo Mira Sorvino) are stylish young marrieds who work respectively in a beauty salon and Dads Italian restaurant but love to show off on the disco floor at night. Theres trouble at home however as the highly priapic Vinny philanders compulsively if guiltily but is less than studly with his wife who suspects his infidelities but feels inadequate over not properly inspiring her husband. Ritchie (Adrien Brody) is a neighborhood boy who shocks his buddies by suddenly and hilariously materializing as a London-style spike-haired punk complete with a temporary and lousy Cockney accent. Ritchie soon hooks up with a lusty local woman Ruby (Jennifer Esposito) while his musical/performance-art career takes him in strange parallel directions as both a punk rock musician and an exotic dancer in a seedy gay theater. Son of Sam as the murderer has now been dubbed achieves infamy and truly arrives as a force of terror in Gotham when he writes Jimmy Breslin and announces ""I am the monster."" He lives for the hunt he proclaims adding that he fully intends to kill again. With this citizens begin staying indoors brunettes dye their hair blond and wear wigs because the female victims have all had brown hair and the cops appeal to local crime boss Luigi (Ben Gazarra) to help find the maniac whos pulling his neighborhood apart. The media fans public paranoia by keeping the story on page one through a summer of record heat and a championship run by the Yankees that Lee typically documents with loving attention (for good measure he also throws in an argument about the relative greatness of Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays and has two thugs pummel a drunk who foolishly admits that his favorite baseball team is the Boston Red Sox). Having shown the killer obliquely as a tortured nutcase who lives in a hellhole and slams his head into his bed while barking like a dog pic finally reveals the killers face and identifies him as David Berkowitz in a scene in which he shoots a ferocious black dog thats been annoying him. He quickly kills again and tempers soar with the temperature as a blackout occurs and riots ensue. The modern urban nightmare has arrived and life is no good for anybody. Ritchie whos afraid his double gay/straight life will be discovered gets a gig at CBGB in the Bowery but when Vinny and Dionna arrive to attend theyre put off by the body-pierced crowd and proceed instead to Studio 54 and then Platos Retreat where they both indulge in heavy (but remarkably inexplicit) group sex. This experience shatters their tenuous marriage and one of the films most potent scenes has them leveling heated and hateful charges at one another in a shattering argument in their car as the specter of Son of Sam lurks in the shadows. Tension in the city reaches its peak on July 29 the first anniversary of the initial killing when the maniac is expected to strike again. Taking matters increasingly into their own hands the Italians blockade their neighborhood and search everyone coming into it then develop the spurious theory that Ritchie is actually Son of Sam. Using a startling special effect Lee has a new black dog speak to the actual murderer and tell him to kill again whereupon he does once more then twice before being apprehended. When its all over everyone has come through the summer rather the worse for wear. In ""Do the Right Thing"" the characters were elemental to the storys dynamic and represented then-current social forces in the city a major reason why the film proved so powerful and relevant. In the similar group portrait undertaken in ""Summer of Sam"" the characters seem more arbitrary. All of them are affected by the atmosphere created by the killings but none is directly connected to it. In other words Vinny Dionna Ritchie Ruby and the Italians toughs are all circumstantial background players in the larger drama being similarly enacted by others throughout a fearful city. Significantly this is not David Berkowitzs story nor is it a police procedural about how the killer was finally snared. Its enough for Lee and his fellow screenwriters Victor Colicchio and Michael Imperioli who penned the early drafts and initially approached Lee just to exec produce to simply identify Son of Sam as a deranged madman and to briefly indicate how a lucky little break led to the solving of the case. The subjects as they have so often been in Lees films are the ever-present social forces that are brought to the fore when conditions become inflamed the way the worst -- or at least the truth -- comes out in people when external conditions force the issues. Pic also examines how the media jumps on things in a way that the public laps up but also whips up widespread misery and panic. Lee directs with a constant sense of visual invention although with less in the way of gimmicks and intrusive experimentation than in some recent outings. Partly because of the heavily Italian milieu and partly because hes clearly trying to supercharge his scenes to the greatest possible extent this is the closest Lee has yet come to Scorsese territory. A fair share of his technique here consists of having the characters yell at one another as much as possible which seems plausible enough on a moment-to-moment basis but has a somewhat numbing effect over the long haul. Ensemble cast fits together snugly with nominal leads Leguizamo Sorvino Brody and Esposito entirely convincing as working-class types struggling with their lives just as they feel their very existence threatened in an extraordinary manner. Lee appears as a sensationalist TV newscaster who spotlights looting and rampaging during the blackout and interviews blacks about what they think of the all-white crime spree. The disco-heavy 70s soundtrack is a major and entertaining mood-setting force although it obscures some dialogue. Cinematographer Ellen Kuras and production designer Therese DePrez both of whom have very recently moved up from the indie world have worked to de-emphasize and deglamorize the period feel which the music and Ruth E.

Starring John Leguizamo Adrien Brody Mira Sorvino and Jennifer Esposito. Directed by Spike Lee. (R. 145 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Any era is good for the people who were young in it. Director Spike Lee was young in New Yorks summer of 1977 -- the summer that a psycho calling himself the Son of Sam was going around shooting young lovers in parked cars . The result is ""Summer of Sam"" a colorful wacked-out film. Its a movie nostalgic for a bad time. Lee captures the glitz and the confusion of living in New York in 1977. The city was in the financial toilet. Crime seemed unstoppable. The sexual revolution seemed like a manifestation of end-of-the-world decadence and anarchy. And into the confusion came this homicidal maniac. Like the Littleton disaster years later the most disturbing thing was that the killings didnt seem like something crazy from without. They seemed like an expression of a whole cultures sickness. Columnist Jimmy Breslin one of the main reporters on the Son of Sam story provides the movies prologue and epilogue. On both sides of the film Breslin says he ""loves and hates"" New York and that point of view -- not so much at odds with itself as broad and complex -- comes through in Lees film. ""Summer of Sam"" which opens today is less about the killings than it is about the effect they had on one Bronx neighborhood. John Leguizamo plays Vinny who is married to Dionna (Mira Sorvino) but cant stop cheating on her. He sees the killings as a personal message from God Stop cheating. Be a good husband. But he cant imagine it. The film does two things that would seem at cross-purposes. It creates a sense of a whole era of its bigness even its grandeur. Yet it also conveys the smallness of New York the smallness of the mentality the provincial neighborhoods the apartments. In this way serial killer David Berkowitz emerges as the ultimate New Yorker gone over the edge. His life has shrunk down to a bad apartment and a barking dog. Several scenes consist of nothing more than Berkowitz (Michael Badalucco) sticking his head under his pillow and screaming his head off while a dog barks outside. Later the dog comes to Berkowitz in a halluci nation and speaking English tells him to kill people. These scenes are funny and Lee knows it. No New York story can be true without a dash of absurdity. Vinny and his buddies live in a disco universe but their friend Ritchie (Adrien Brody) is a punk rocker who is beginning to discover himself in Manhattans downtown music scene. (His band is called Late Term Abortion.) The resentment that the neighborhood thugs feel toward Ritchie -- the clans fear of the outsider -- is a big part of the movie. But its not too big a part. The most refreshing thing about ""Summer of Sam"" is that it doesnt try to impose a moral or define the limits of its story. It takes its time. Out of nowhere Lee will toss in a montage (to the Whos ""Baba ORiley"") of one character shooting heroin another smoking pot; of Ritchie strumming his guitar Reggie Jackson hitting a home run and Berkowitz going around killing people. In one sequence Vinny and his wife drive to the punk club CBGBs try to get into Studio 54 and end up at the sex club Platos Retreat. Its an only-in-the-70s night and its there among other reasons to give the flavor of the times. Lees relaxed pace pays off. Virtually every scene plays out long enough to have some color. Leguizamo is terrific as a smooth fellow whose weakness of character is slowly making his life unravel while Brody gives Ritchie a core of integrity underneath the ridiculous surface. Sorvinos best scenes are the wrenching arguments with Leguizamo. Jennifer Esposito comes into her own as the neighborhood slut but then all the performances are strong. Lees pace allows even the minor characters richness and depth. The result is his best movie since ""Do the Right Thing.""

In Summer of Sam Spike Lee isnt interested in truth -- or coherence for that matter. Instead wearing the Professional Provocateur cap hes so maddeningly attached to Lee is at his most bombastic In this hotheaded sociological fantasy he attempts to link the disco glitz of Studio 54 the punk scene of CBGB the ethnic insularity of Italian Americans the bloody shooting spree of a madman who taunted the police the effect of sizzling heat on city asphalt and the sexual problems between a sweaty Bronx local named Vinny (John Leguizamo) and his frustrated wife Dionna (Mira Sorvino) into one rattling chain of urban hysteria. The links dont hold broken by the kind of addled deductions (women are blown away because one guy in the Bronx cheats on his wife?) race baiting and sexual nutsiness with which Lee tends to undermine his own strongest artistic interests. An intro and coda by newspaper columnist and self-created character Jimmy Breslin -- a ""Dead End"" street sign positioned showily behind him -- adds to the manufactured swagger. There is as ever a magnetically florid sweep to Lees scene making Fetishistic care is lavished for example on an orgy at the infamous sex club Platos Retreat. Time is wasted showing Dionna dancing (with trademark Sorvino self-consciousness). The real less baroque motivations of people though -- comprehensible people rather than symbols and placeholders -- are of minimal interest to the filmmaker. Out of this morass one actor etches a character of lingering effect As a paisan of Vinnys whose passionate conversion to the punk lifestyle alienates his former street-corner pals to the point of violent fury Adrien Brody emerges as the costar whose star qualities we didnt have enough time to appreciate in The Thin Red Line. We learn nothing from Summer of Sam except thanks to Brody that punks are people too.
