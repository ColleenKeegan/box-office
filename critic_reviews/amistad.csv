Moments later he uses the nail to unlock himself from the chains hes wearing and proceeds to lead an ambush against his captors -- the white overseers on the Spanish slave ship La Amistad which is heading toward Cuba on a stormy night in 1839. The sequence is shocking for two reasons. One because its raw and bloody and frenzied culminating in the image of the man with a roar of vengeance plunging a sword into his captors chest. But its also shocking because the characters dont exist as individuals. They havent been glimpsed in the light -- theyre strictly butchers and meat -- and so the brutality itself is violently dehumanized a ""mythical"" abstraction of slave rage. The vengeful mutineers drift on the ocean for two months and are apprehended by a British military vessel off the coast of Long Island. As they go on trial for murder Amistad replaying the events surrounding the actual Amistad insurrection puts the issue of slavery itself on trial. Bravely the film takes its radical stand It says that slavery is wrong obscene an assault on human dignity and freedom. To make the case it introduces a series of dryly articulate statesmen-advocates. Theres the affable real estate attorney Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) who is eager to take up the cause of the Amistad slaves none of whom can speak English. There are the diplomatic -- and rather ineffectual -- abolitionists Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard). And theres the former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) a noble if reluctant freedom fighter who is ultimately wheeled out of retirement as though the moment had arrived for him to audition for a place on a dollar bill to argue the case before the Supreme Court. Amistad as you may have gathered is not exactly an African-American Schindlers List. In that movie Spielberg was out to capture the existential terrors of the Holocaust the experience of the unspeakable; the films force lay in its vividly unfolding moment-to-moment realism. Amistad takes on a mass atrocity of more than comparable scope but its approach is almost bizarrely academic. Midway through theres a 20-minute sequence that showcases in graphic detail the claustrophobic horrors of the ""Middle Passage"" (bloody whippings starvation mass drownings). Otherwise though the film seems all but uninterested in the psychological experience of slavery or indeed in the personalities of its slave protagonists. Its investment is in the issue of slavery one that Spielberg uses to craft a courtroom drama of dull soapbox ponderousness. As Cinque who leads the revolt Djimon Hounsou has a fine incendiary presence; he does all he can to create a full-bodied character. But the role as written allows Hounsou precious few dimensions. Cinque speaks in Mende his native African tongue and the movie at once respects the historical reality of this difficulty and plays with it in a disquieting way. Cinque and his cohorts speak with subtitles -- sometimes. At others their words arent subtitled and remain baffling to us. But why? Why not let us hear the intimacy of their thoughts when theyre with one another? The first hour of Amistad is devoted to the laborious spectacle of McConaugheys Baldwin trying to devise a way to communicate with Cinque and to learn where exactly he comes from. By the time Cinque having absorbed a few words of English stands up at the end of the first trial (there are two more to go) and shouts ""Give us...free"" he has been made into such a passive figure that the film seems less morally enlightened than its own ad campaign (""Freedom is not given.... But there are moments when it must be taken""). Amistad is two and a half hours of black men sitting around in chains waiting to be given their freedom. By the time John Q. Adams with his aristocratic sideburns shows up at the Supreme Court the film has lapsed into liberal self-caricature. Hopkins usually a great actor grins and shambles as if he were the Wizard of Oz handing out prizes (a diploma for you and you guys...get your freedom). No wonder Amistad presents Adams as its true hero. Hes the one who clinches the victory and victory (as in awards) is what this movie has its eye on.

Except for the overkill of the seizure of the Spanish ship (La Amistad) transporting the slaves to the New World and a flashback of Africans being sent to a watery grave it registers chiefly as upmarket visually bland TV drama. As the fate of the 53 slaves charged with murder is determined in the courts the politically and philosophically diverse factions are laboriously established the Abolitionists (Freeman and Skarsgard); their initially dispassionate young lawyer (McConaughey); the pro-slavery attorney (Postlethwaite); President Van Buren (Hawthorne) keen to appease the South Spains teenage Queen Isabella and an electorate about to vote; and former President John Quincy Adams (Hopkins) a curmudgeonly eccentric who eventually emerges from retirement to argue for brave unbending Cinque (Hounsou) and the other defendants. In short a wordy courtroom drama which seldom progresses beyond ciphers stereotypes and salutary slogans.

Starring Morgan Freeman Djimon Hounsou Matthew McConaughey Anthony Hopkins Nigel Hawthorne Anna Paquin. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Written by David Franzoni. (R. 150 minutes. At the Bay Area theaters.) As much as he wants to do the right thing in his serious films Steven Spielberg inevitably falls back on old tricks technical dazzle and twinkly sentiment. In ""Schindlers List"" a remarkable artistic leap that bore no resemblance to the soda pop and cotton candy of ""Jaws"" and ""Indiana Jones"" Spielberg turned on the schmaltz spigot in the last reel when a group of Jewish women formed a Pieta-like circle and gave the weeping Oskar Schindler a group hug. In ""Amistad"" an admirable but disappointing effort that opens today at Bay Area theaters Spielberg uses a more conventional format than he did in the stripped-down black-and-white ""Schindlers List"" and delivers a film that veers between stoic political correctness and mushy pop-Hollywood platitudes. The result is earnest and worthy but far less imaginative than ""Schindlers List."" A message film about freedom justice and the essentials of human dignity ""Amistad"" is the true story of a 1839 slave-ship mutiny in which 53 Africans murder all but two of their Spanish captors off the Cuban coast. Conned by the survivors into thinking they are headed home the Africans are captured off the New England coast by a U.S. naval ship and brought to trial for murder. Its a classic piece of buried history shamefully missing from most American history textbooks and Spielberg -- who has been accused by the author of borrowing fictional elements from Barbara Chase-Ribouds 1989 novel ""Echo of Lions"" -- deserves a heap of credit for bringing it to light. Spielberg opens the film on board La Amistad -- the name comes from the Spanish word for friendship -- with a close-up of an African mans hand feverishly removing a nail from his chains. He is Senge Pieh a rice farmer renamed Cinque by the Spanish and he sparks the slave rebellion when he impales a Spanish officer with a sword. Spielberg films the scene with intense close-ups and loud squish- and-crunch sound effects then shoots the triumphant Cinque from below framing him against a magical horizon of indigo sky and twinkling stars. You know our Spielberg -- just cant resist an ""awwww"" shot. Played by West African actor Djimon Hounsou in his film debut Cinque is our emotional point of reference in ""Amistad."" When the slaves are jailed in Connecticut and their banner is raised by an African American abolitionist (Morgan Freeman) his white colleague (Stellan Skarsgard) and a naive attorney (Matthew McConaughey) its Hounsous face -- outraged furious at barriers of language and culture -- that speaks for his people. ""Amistad"" clearly places its sympathy with the Africans yet Spielberg and screenwriter David Franzoni (""Citizen Cohn"") devote far more time to the American characters and the different factions that either defend or manipulate the Africans or attempt to return them to the Spanish. The Middle Passage across the Atlantic during which the Africans are treated as cargo fed like animals whipped and raped occupies only a tiny part of the film. Instead we get legal arguments from McConaughey who says the Africans are ""stolen goods"" and we see the spineless opportunism of President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) who fears losing Southern votes in his re-election campaign if he sides with the Africans. When the case goes before the Supreme Court retired President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) neither a foe nor a proponent of slavery reluctantly defends the Africans. Delivering a grand flowery speech as only Hopkins can do the elder statesman calls the Amistad incident a ""historic conflagration"" and deems Cinque ""the only true hero in this room."" Hopkins makes the most of his moments as the crusty but wise Adams and Hounsou the standout in the cast brings a magnificent fierce integrity to Cinque. Freeman is wasted however as the slave- turned-abolitionist Theodore Joadson while McConaughey is close to embarrassing with his mutton chops wire-rimmed specs and broad gesturing. ""Amistad"" has moments of great poetry and passion and the fidelity with which it captures early 19th century America cant be faulted. Even with the excesses of Spielbergs showy technique and Hallmark emotion this is a wonderful story that needed to be told.

"Amistad | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; amistad ) Amistad (United States 1997) A movie review by James Berardinelli Heres a word analogy Amistad is to The Lost World as Schindlers List is to Jurassic Park. In 1993 after Steven Spielberg made the monster dino hit many critics described Schindlers List as the directors ""penance"" (as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster). Now after a three-year layoff Spielberg is back with a vengeance. Once again his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers. Now following his 1993 pattern he has fashioned another serious inspirational Christmas release about the nature of humanity. That film is Amistad. Although not as masterful as Schindlers List Amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture. Thematically rich impeccably crafted and intellectually stimulating the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact. Watching Schindlers List was a powerful almost spiritual experience. Spielberg pulled us into the narrative absorbed us in the drama then finally let us go exhausted and shattered three-plus hours later. Aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since. Amistad while a fine example of film making is not as transcendent. The incident of the ship La Amistad is not found in any history books but considering who writes the texts thats not a surprise. However the event is a part of the American social and legal fabric and while Amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account most of the basic facts are in order. Several mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the films dramatic force. On the whole while Amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired. One stormy night during the summer of 1839 the 53 men imprisoned on the Spanish slave ship La Amistad escape. Led by the lion-hearted Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) they take control of the vessel killing most of the crew. Adrift somewhere off the coast of Cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to Africa they rely on the two surviving Spaniards to navigate the eastward journey. They are tricked however and the La Amistad which makes its way northward off the United States eastern coastline is eventually captured by an American naval ship near Connecticut. The kidnapped Africans are shackled and thrown into prison charged with murder and piracy. The first men to come to the Africans defense are abolitionists Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard). They are soon joined by Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) a property attorney of little repute. Aided by advice from former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) Baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men not property -- convinces the judge. But powerful forces have aligned against Baldwins cause. Current President Martin Van Buren (Nigel Hawthorne) eager to please Southern voters and 11-year old Queen Isabella of Spain (Anna Paquin) begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the Africans goes free. At its heart Amistad is a tale of human courage. Cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to. He is a free man not a slave and while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle he will not give it up. Effectively portrayed by newcomer Djimon Hounsou whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention Cinque is the key to viewers seeing the Amistad Africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies. They are individuals and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movies success. To amplify this point Spielberg presents many scenes from the Africans point-of-view detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white mans seemingly-strange ""rituals"". The larger struggle is of course one of defining humanity. As the Nazis felt justified in slaughtering Jews because they viewed their victims as ""sub-human"" so the pro-slavery forces of Amistad use a similar defense. The abolitionists regard the Africans as men but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property. In a sense the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war which would break out less than three decades later looming over everything. Amistads presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history. Four claimants come forward against the Africans the state which wants them tried for murder; the Queen of Spain who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an American/Spanish treaty; two American naval officers who claim the right of high seas salvage; and the two surviving Spaniards from La Amistad who demand that their property be returned to them. Baldwin must counter all of these claims while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with Cinque. Even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier they gradually learn to communicate. Aside from Cinque who is a fully-realized individual characterization is spotty but the acting is top-notch. Matthew McConaughey successfully overcomes his ""pretty boy"" image to become Baldwin but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the La Amistad case. Likewise while Morgan Freeman and Stellan Skarsgard are effective as Joadson and Tappan they are never anything more than ""abolitionists."" Nigel Hawthorne who played the title character in The Madness of King George presents Martin Van Buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election. Finally theres Anthony Hopkins whose towering portrayal of John Quincy Adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done. Hopkins who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer an emotionally-crippled English butler and Richard Nixon makes us believe that he is Adams. His ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable. One point of difference worth noting between Amistad and Schindlers List is this films lack of a well-defined human villain. Schindlers List had Ralph Fiennes superbly-realized Amon Goeth who was not only a three-dimensional character but a personification of all that the Nazis stood for. There is no such figure in Amistad. The villain is slavery but an ideology no matter how evil is rarely the best adversary. It is to Spielbergs credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist. Amistads trek to the screen which encountered some choppy waters (author Barbara Chase-Riboud has cried plagiarism a charge denied by the film makers) comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident. An opera of the same name opened in Chicago on November 29 1997. Numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves. It remains to be seen how much longevity the Amistad phenomena has but one thing is certain -- with Spielbergs rousing substantive film leading the way the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of American history.

Moments later he uses the nail to unlock himself from the chains hes wearing and proceeds to lead an ambush against his captors -- the white overseers on the Spanish slave ship La Amistad which is heading toward Cuba on a stormy night in 1839. The sequence is shocking for two reasons. One because its raw and bloody and frenzied culminating in the image of the man with a roar of vengeance plunging a sword into his captors chest. But its also shocking because the characters dont exist as individuals. They havent been glimpsed in the light -- theyre strictly butchers and meat -- and so the brutality itself is violently dehumanized a ""mythical"" abstraction of slave rage. The vengeful mutineers drift on the ocean for two months and are apprehended by a British military vessel off the coast of Long Island. As they go on trial for murder Amistad replaying the events surrounding the actual Amistad insurrection puts the issue of slavery itself on trial. Bravely the film takes its radical stand It says that slavery is wrong obscene an assault on human dignity and freedom. To make the case it introduces a series of dryly articulate statesmen-advocates. Theres the affable real estate attorney Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) who is eager to take up the cause of the Amistad slaves none of whom can speak English. There are the diplomatic -- and rather ineffectual -- abolitionists Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) and Lewis Tappan (Stellan Skarsgard). And theres the former President John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) a noble if reluctant freedom fighter who is ultimately wheeled out of retirement as though the moment had arrived for him to audition for a place on a dollar bill to argue the case before the Supreme Court. Amistad as you may have gathered is not exactly an African-American Schindlers List. In that movie Spielberg was out to capture the existential terrors of the Holocaust the experience of the unspeakable; the films force lay in its vividly unfolding moment-to-moment realism. Amistad takes on a mass atrocity of more than comparable scope but its approach is almost bizarrely academic. Midway through theres a 20-minute sequence that showcases in graphic detail the claustrophobic horrors of the ""Middle Passage"" (bloody whippings starvation mass drownings). Otherwise though the film seems all but uninterested in the psychological experience of slavery or indeed in the personalities of its slave protagonists. Its investment is in the issue of slavery one that Spielberg uses to craft a courtroom drama of dull soapbox ponderousness. As Cinque who leads the revolt Djimon Hounsou has a fine incendiary presence; he does all he can to create a full-bodied character. But the role as written allows Hounsou precious few dimensions. Cinque speaks in Mende his native African tongue and the movie at once respects the historical reality of this difficulty and plays with it in a disquieting way. Cinque and his cohorts speak with subtitles -- sometimes. At others their words arent subtitled and remain baffling to us. But why? Why not let us hear the intimacy of their thoughts when theyre with one another? The first hour of Amistad is devoted to the laborious spectacle of McConaugheys Baldwin trying to devise a way to communicate with Cinque and to learn where exactly he comes from. By the time Cinque having absorbed a few words of English stands up at the end of the first trial (there are two more to go) and shouts ""Give us...free"" he has been made into such a passive figure that the film seems less morally enlightened than its own ad campaign (""Freedom is not given.... But there are moments when it must be taken""). Amistad is two and a half hours of black men sitting around in chains waiting to be given their freedom. By the time John Q. Adams with his aristocratic sideburns shows up at the Supreme Court the film has lapsed into liberal self-caricature. Hopkins usually a great actor grins and shambles as if he were the Wizard of Oz handing out prizes (a diploma for you and you guys...get your freedom). No wonder Amistad presents Adams as its true hero. Hes the one who clinches the victory and victory (as in awards) is what this movie has its eye on.
