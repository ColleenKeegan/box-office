Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist takes everything you loved in three decades of teenage romance and twists it into something unrecognisably desperate and exploitative. First theres Nick (Michael Cera) the kind of lovelorn hipster nerd who makes mixtapes and plays in a failing electro band with two hilarious gay sidekicks. Then theres Norah the sad-eyed dreamer no one is attracted to played by the jaw-detachingly beautiful Kat Dennings. Over the course of a drunken night in NYC the pair drift together apart and back together to a soundtrack of unmemorable indie-rock whingery. In this post-Juno world teenagers are required to speak like middle-aged music journalists drink like rampant navvies on shore leave and fornicate like hotel heiresses. So perhaps its churlish to expect movies about them to be anything more than crass offensive and shallow.

By Peter Rainer October 4 2008 Save for later Saved Michael Cera left Ari Graynor Kat Dennings right are shown in a scene from Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist. JoJo Whilden/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Teen comedies will be greatly diminished when Michael Cera grows out of them. His ability to seem both lightweight and impassioned makes him the perfect uberadolescent. His presence did much to cauterize the raunchier passages in ""Superbad"" and he was marvelous as Ellen Pages unlikely yet perfect love object in ""Juno."" (He was unlikely because most teen movies favor party animal Romeos and perfect because you couldnt imagine Juno with anybody else.)Cera has his biggest role to date in ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist"" and the movie needs every minute of him. He plays Nick a Yugo-driving New Jersey high school senior and bass guitar player who is still mooning over the fickle girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena) who recently dumped him. He keeps hoping hell win her back by making killer indie-rock mix CDs for her but instead he ends up paired with one of her sometime friends Norah (Kat Dennings) whose father is a record industry mogul. Together in the course of a single night they uneasily make their way across lower Manhattan in search of a secret concert by their favorite underground band.Based on a popular novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan and echoing everything from ""American Graffiti"" to ""Before Sunrise"" this is a movie that doesnt know how to say ""no."" Every moment expertly capturing the tingly tensions of teen love is matched by goofball gross-outs that are more disgusting than funny. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Its as if screenwriter Lorene Scafaria and director Peter Sollett whose first film was the terrific ""Raising Victor Vargas"" didnt trust the storys emotional core. Its rare these days to encounter a teen-oriented movie that respects adolescents for being more than sex-crazed head cases so its doubly frustrating that ""Nick and Norah"" which intermittently is quite touching so often condescends to its audience by going all goony on us. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist What makes the film work in spite of itself is Solletts sympathy for his characters and the teamwork between Cera and Dennings whose winsome sultriness seems entirely unaffected. Its clear from the moment Nick and Norah meet that they are meant for each other which is as it should be. After all she has been doting on Nicks mixes which she retrieved from Triss wastebasket even before she met him. The conceit here is that if a boy and a girl love the same music that means theyre in love. Who am I to argue with such poetic whimsy? Grade B- (Rated PG-13 for mature thematic material including teen drinking sexuality language and crude behavior.)

"Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist reviewed. Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 2 2008 435 PM Shyness Is Nice Michael Cera in Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist. By Dana Stevens Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist (Sony)is so slight its almost diaphanous--an hour after seeing it what the movie leaves behind is not so much a memory as a mood. Still its a fine mood lit with the sparkle of the Manhattan skyline and scored to a wistful indie-pop soundtrack. Teen viewers accustomed to the rapid-fire vulgarities of Superbad and Pineapple Express may snort at this movies emo guilelessness. But like its source a young-adult novel of the same name by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan Playlist is unabashedly romantic. Some people really were made for each other the movie asserts and New York does look beautiful by night. You got a problem with that? Besides its heroes iconic names Playlist makes no reference to the Nick and Nora of the Thin Man comedies of the 30s and 40s. And unlike their martini-swilling screwball counterparts this Nick and Norah are straight-edge New Jersey teens who can party all night without downing so much as a beer. Nick (Michael Cera) the only straight member of a queercore band called the Jerk Offs is still mooning over his ex-girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena). He burns her homemade CD mixes with titles like ""Road to Closure Volume XII"" which Tris promptly tosses in the garbage. Norah (Kat Dennings) Tris classmate and the daughter of a famous record executive secretly retrieves these CDs from the trash--like Nick shes a music geek with omnivorous tastes. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. See what other critics are saying in Slate Vs ""Summary Judgment."" Over the course of one night the two will fall for each other while roaming New York City in search of two things a show to be played at an unnamed venue by the underground band Wheres Fluffy? and Norahs hard-partying best friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) who wanders off into the night after one tequila shot too many. The wheres-Caroline subplot soon devolves into a string of standard-issue gross-out gags (though Graynor an Angie Dickinson look-alike is funny and admirably game). But as Nick and Norah bounce from hipster bar to all-night diner to drag cabaret (in a lower Manhattan whose most fantastical feature is its abundance of good parking spaces) you cant help but root for them to hook up--not that that outcome is ever in any real jeopardy. The competitive Tris makes a few halfhearted attempts to win back Nick while Norah endures some pawing from her ex Tal (Jay Baruchel nailing a small role as a sleazy arriviste). But essentially this is a one-crazy-night movie in which all that matters is the mysterious momentum that propels our protagonists from one shimmering backdrop to the next. Like Before Sunrise or the lovely karaoke-bar sequence at the center of Lost in Translation Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist captures the excitement of exploring a city with someone you barely know and really really like. Peter Sollett (Raising Victor Vargas) directing from a script by Lorene Scafaria seems unsure of whether he wants to be John Hughes or Paul Weitz (the director of American Pie who also co-produced this movie). I wish Sollett had forgone the broader stuff and gone with his sharp instinct for romantic comedy which at its best calls for more than just snappy banter. I particularly dug a love scene in a recording studio in which the central couples off-screen passion is registered on an audio soundboard and a moment when Nick uses his windshield wipers to wash away the memory of an old love. Ive already lobbed so many valentines at Michael Cera that the poor kid is probably hiding from me behind his locker door. At the age of 15 he fully grasped the unorthodox comic strategy of the Fox series Arrested Development and entered into its world. At 19 he quietly stole both Superbad and Juno from his far more effusive co-stars. Critics are starting to get on Cera now 20 for always playing the same stammering diffident nice-guy role but when was that ever a problem for the comic hes most often compared to Bob Newhart? After reading this recent profile of the press-shy young actor I half-hope that Cera does drop out of the acting game not for our sake (I could watch him stammer on a weekly basis and if Arrested Development were still on I would) but for his. The idea of him ""stretching"" to play some Oscar-bait tormented hero and being critically savaged for his trouble is just too painful to contemplate. As we used to scrawl in high-school yearbooks Dont ever change Michael. Stay sweet. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Bailey Columbia Pictures Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 Michael Cera and Kat Dennings star in ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist."" Michael Cera and Kat Dennings star in ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist."" Photo K.C. Bailey Columbia Pictures Review Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist Romantic comedy. Starring Michael Cera and Kat Dennings. Directed by Peter Sollett. (Rated PG-13. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. To see complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to SFGate.com/movies.) ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" belongs to a small specialized genre of teen romantic comedies - the One Great Night genre - and when those movies hit the mark they can be pretty glorious. Think ""American Graffiti."" Think ""Superbad."" Think that underrated gem from the 1980s ""Modern Girls."" The genre exists in response to something real and that realness is the source of its power Every so often when youre young and particularly when youre a teenager there comes a night when everyone is out and everyone seems to be doing something amazing. The weather is great. Time slows down. Music never sounded better. Romance suddenly presents itself. And you feel wonderfully understood invincible and loved. Thats a great night and movies that replicate even a share of that feeling will always have their place. ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" doesnt quite grab a share of that emotion but it does get a half share. Michael Cera is a lovesick senior who spends his time making playlist CDs in honor of the awful superficial girl who dumped him months ago. Ceras comic skill is way beyond his 20 years. He has timing and delivery. He can act and he has that extra something the gift of being likable of inciting empathy in the audience. He is nicely matched by Kat Dennings a relative newcomer with lots of charm and intelligence who plays a time-honored character in teen movies - the beautiful girl who nobody notices is beautiful who doesnt think of herself as pretty but rather as some kind of awkward ungainly egghead. The two leads are special and thats half the ballgame. But Cera and Dennings are all ""Nick amp; Norah"" has. Their performances are true. Their interaction is authentic and the development of the characters mutual attraction is adequately calibrated. But everything surrounding these actors and these characters is dishonest. The fact that Nick (Cera) who is straight only has gay friends strikes a peculiar note but even worse these gay friends act the way the classic Gay Neighbor does in adult romantic comedies They live to promote the romantic success of the hetero friend. The story is as shallow as the gimmick of naming the lead characters Nick and Norah (in a meaningless homage to ""The Thin Man"" protagonists). The big night this time involves a group of suburban kids being thrown together feverishly driving around Manhattan looking for a rock concert thats going to be taking place in a secret location. There are many complications all of them comic in a mirthless way or frenetic in a labored way. The supporting characters arent vivid and a sense of magic never takes hold. Heres something funny A big moment in the movie comes when the hero summoning all his strength resists the physical charms of his mean ex-girlfriend (Alexis Dziena) as she does a provocative dance to Hot Chocolates 1976 hit ""You Sexy Thing."" Alas the scene might have had more moral meaning if both the dance (and the song) werent spectacularly unsexy. After a dance like that our hero might have joined a monastery. One Great Night movies are like the great memorable nights that inspire them They dont start out great. They sneak up and at a certain point you realize youre in the midst of one. ""Nick amp; Norah"" seems an attempt to achieve that feeling out of spare parts out of everything but genuine inspiration. It plays like a movie inspired by good movies not by the emotion that inspires good movies. Still the appeal of Cera and Dennings keep the movie within the realm of a mildly good time. -- Advisory This film contains drug use and sexual situations.

Despite a valiant attempt though it doesnt quite make the grade. Director Peter Sollett is too heavily influenced by better movies ""Juno"" being the most recent example. But one key to any teen romance is an ideally chosen cast and leads Michael Cera and Kat Dennings do this tradition proud. RELATED NICK amp; NORAH HEAT UP THE SCREEN Dennings is Norah the kind of smart cynical girl inevitably out of place in a cliquey New Jersey high school. Ceras Nick is stuck in the same suburban purgatory just waiting for the world to open up. Obsessed with music and endearingly sensitive he somehow landed ultra-popular Tris (Alexis Dziena) for a few months. Though hes been hiding at home since she dumped him he cant let his bandmates down at their gig in Manhattan. As luck would have it Norah and her friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) happen to be there too. After a series of only-in-the-movies manipulations a drunken Caroline gets lost leaving Nick and Norah to spend the evening searching for her. None of the action makes much sense but Sollett isnt focused on logic. He appears to believe his audience will be happy with some ironically witty dialogue an indie soundtrack and solid chemistry between the leads. Hes probably right so its to his credit that he also makes the most of his setting celebrating after-hours New York with genuine affection. Still its hard to escape the nagging feeling that a premise this promising should have developed into something more. The supporting cast is weak and the self-conscious screenplay - adapted from a novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan - is disappointingly superficial. Ceras familiar awkward hesitancy does remain appealing even if hes in danger of limiting himself. Certainly its Dennings who seems to be the more nuanced actor.

In this image released by Sony Pictures Michael Cera Ari Graynor Kat Dennings are shown in a scene from ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist."" (AP Photo/Sony Pictures JoJo Whilden) Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald The problem with most movie romances -- the thing that makes so many of them tough to sit through -- is that youre usually just waiting for the couple to get on with it and realize theyre made for each other so you can go home and continue about your business. Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist director Peter Solletts follow-up to his debut Raising Victor Vargas is on the surface another one of those movies. You have Nick (Michael Cera) the sole straight member of a gay punk-rock band and you have Norah (Kat Dennings) the sole Jewish girl in a Catholic high school. They are kindred spirits -- outcasts even within the carefully constructed universes adolescents build for themselves. Even if the films title hadnt already keyed you in on it youd know Nick and Norah are destined to fall in love before the night in Infinite Playlist is over. The multitude of obstacles that stand in their way -- Nicks lingering crush on his manipulative ex-girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena) or Norahs best friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) who has gotten disastrously drunk and wandered off into big bad New York City -- will be overcome before the sun rises. The plot centers on Nick and Norahs quixotic quest to find out where their favorite band the underground group Wheres Fluffy is performing a secret gig. But its merely a means for the two teens to discover each other. Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist which was adapted from the beloved young adult novel by first-time screenwriter Lorene Scafaria has the comic sensibility and warmth of character of vintage John Hughes films. But much like he did in Victor Vargas director Sollett adds a humanistic layer of insight and wisdom to the story that transcends teen-pic formulas. There are countless little moments in Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist -- Nick using his Yugos windshield wipers to clear away a lipstick smear the silent look between two girls that expresses the end of their friendship and the beginning of a rivalry -- that resonate with heartache and exhilaration. The movie is filled with wonderful music memorable characters and rich quotable dialogue (I refuse to be the goody bag at your pity party.) But what makes the picture really soar is the way it reminds you what it feels like to fall in love -- and the endless countless possibilities a new romance brings.

Mohammed ""Mo"" Amer and Azhar Usman make fun of themselves -- their wife and mother jokes are universal; much of their ethnic shtick could be Jewish or Italian -- and their situation. Amer bounds onstage expressing incredulity ""This is a lot of room for a Palestinian"" The heavily bearded Usman starts immediately with bin Laden jokes. Usman is less cautious than Amer -- a good vaudevillian he rags on Jews and Catholics as well as South Asians -- but he still stops well short of any irreverence. And Allah Made Me Funny is a relative concept Its obvious that Amer and Usman labor under the burden of making humor at once insider-cool and outsider-friendly. And its hard to finesse ""offensive"" from a defensive crouch. The most skilled comic of the three is the nation of Islam convert Bryant ""Preacher"" Moss who not only evokes Saddam Hussein but goes on to imagine him as a black man in court arguing with the judge. ""The U.S. is scared by two things"" Moss riffs. ""I got the best of both worlds."" Hes completely self-referential. Perhaps self-satirizing his faith will be next.(Sunset 5) (J. Hoberman) AN AMERICAN CAROL In this astonishingly inept alleged satire from director and co-writer David Zucker -- an even more virulent us-against-them jeremiad than Bill Mahers Religulous -- a bumbling trio of Islamic terrorists set off for America in search of a Hollywood director to help them make a recruitment video for suicide bombers. They find their white knight in slovenly Michigan-born documentary maker Michael Malone (get it?) whose credits include Die You American Pigs and No Country for Anyone and who in turn finds his latent patriotic impulses stirred by visits from the ghosts of JFK George S. Patton and George Washington (played I kid you not by Jon Voight). The jokes such as they are come at the expense of people named ""Mohammed"" or ""Hussein"" vegans homosexuals and pretty much anyone who dares to question authority. In the most grotesque musical number this side of From Justin to Kelly a chorus line of leering pot-smoking academics conflates higher learning with liberal brainwashing but its Zucker who is the real revisionist historian here equating peace negotiations with Appeasement; likening Moore/Malone (Kevin Farley) to Leni Riefenstahl; invoking the Civil War as an argument against pacifism. Theres been one razor-sharp cultural lampoon at the movies this year -- Adam Sandlers Dont Mess With the Zohan -- although Zuckers achievement may in fact be more remarkable. His movies level of political discourse makes Couric/Palin look like Frost/Nixon.  (Selected theaters) (Scott Foundas) GO  BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA Undersized lapdogs make me grumpy even when they dont talk wear pink booties and shop Rodeo Drive. So I came to Beverly Hills Chihuahua with poison pen at the ready -- only to be won over by the exuberant charms of Raja Gosnells comedy about a snobby privileged Chihuahua named Chloe (voiced by Drew Barrymore) and her similarly spoiled-rotten 90210 dog sitter (Piper Perabo). The twosome grow some backbone when they get lost in the bowels of Baja where the pooch must be rescued from the clutches of Mexican dogfight wranglers. If the studios are finally going to make their mark on Latino audiences they could do a lot worse than this wicked satire on Beverly Hills pet excess with its sharp script a fun performance by Jamie Lee Curtis as Chloes overindulgent owner and a mostly Spanish-speaking cast that includes Andy Garcia as a clapped-out police dog Cheech Marin as a cunning rat whos after Chloes Harry Winston collar and George Lopez as a Chihuahua from the wrong side of the tracks who loves Chloe. This being Disney wholesome character-building messages abound but for once theyre freshly spun as cautions against stereotyping both ethnic and canine. And if having seen Beverly Hills Chihuahua your children grow up without the desire to turn their pets into idiot fashion accessories or extensions of their own shopaholic fantasies so much the better.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  BLINDNESS The most recent example of bleak chic Fernando Meirelles mostly harrowing adaptation of Jose Saramagos international bestseller Blindness is unflinching at best and treacly at worst. Set in a gray and metallic modern metropolis (actually Sao Paolo mixed in with Montevideo and Toronto) the film like the novel opens with a man (Yusuke Iseya) in a car stopped at a traffic light who suddenly loses his vision. Another man (actor-screenwriter Don McKellar) who drives him home and later steals his car also falls prey to the mysterious ""white blindness"" as does the first victims doctor (Mark Ruffalo). Soon the entire human population finds itself engulfed in a milky sightlessness save inexplicably one the doctors wife (Julianne Moore). Meirelles working with his Brazilian cinematographer Cesar Charlone establishes the plagues outbreak with visual flair evoking the experience of the ivory blindness through blurry and brightly overexposed frames. Like Saramago Meirelles doesnt much care about the medical or psychological specifics of blindness nor is he interested in the fate of any one human but rather humanity as a whole. (Theres obviously a grand metaphor here -- people are ""blind"" -- but its pretty simplistic.) Panned in Cannes Blindness has since lost a reportedly ponderous voice-over spoken by Danny Glover who appears as a sagely old man with a none-too-subtle eye-patch -- undoubtedly a wise move. The movie is strongest when its not trying to say anything but instead conveying the sheer desperation of its characters. Blindness pulls the viewer into its nightmarish vision and dares us to watch how humankind -- at the level of both governments and individuals -- fails to cope in times of chaos. And considering the current headlines maybe thats insightful enough. (Citywide) (Anthony Kaufman)  GO  BOOGIE MAN THE LEE ATWATER STORY Just about everyone interviewed for Stefan Forbes fascinating documentary about Lee Atwater -- whether Democrat or Republican pols African-American bluesmen or hardened reporters -- ends anecdotes about the Republican strategists dirty tricks with a titter thats either nervous or ambivalently appreciative. Politically speaking it may be enough to know that Atwater who shamelessly drove race into the 1988 presidential campaign to destroy Michael Dukakis and win the election for George Bush Sr. was a disciple of Strom Thurmond got along like a house on fire with Bush Jr. and taught Karl Rove most of what he knows about exploiting media. But Forbes adroitly fills out his picture of this ""marsupial"" little man with ""the eyes of a killer"" through the testimony of those who admired and/or loathed Atwater. Less persuasive is Forbes perfunctory psychologically thin rummage through Atwaters childhood for a traumatic event that would explain his utter ruthlessness. He finds one but its much less interesting than the question of whether the blues-playing Southerner was a racist or merely a cynic or the films revelations about the ambiguities of Atwaters highly publicized remorse with hand on Bible as he lay dying (and largely ignored by the dynasty he had served so assiduously) of brain cancer. (Sunset 5) (Ella Taylor) FIREPROOF When Capt. Caleb Holt (Kirk Cameron) decides to divorce his Sarah Palin-type wife his bros at the firehouse come to his rescue with words of wisdom swiped from the annals of Hallmark ""You never leave your partner especially during a fire."" With advice like this its no wonder Caleb turns to Jesus. Naturally director Alex Kendricks style suggests a pharmaceutical commercial -- especially during scenes of Caleb and his father plodding through the woods toward a creepily and strategically placed cross -- because what is Fireproof selling if not a drug? But before it even mentions God the film works sweetly as a chronicle of a man trying to extend the courage he shows on the job to his marriage by following a 40-day experiment called ""The Love Dare"" which necessitates being kind to Catherine (Erin Bethea) and ultimately unkind to himself -- by giving up his dream of owning a boat and beating the shit out of his computer for teasing him with a pornographic pop-up ad. Then the film gets all religulous suggesting that Calebs devotion to healing means nothing without Jesus and so Fireproof stops becoming relatable to us all and only to the already or easily indoctrinated. (Selected theaters) (Ed Gonzalez) FLASH OF GENIUS The big-screen version of inventor Robert Kearns legal battles with Ford and Chrysler -- both of whom nicked his intermittent windshield wiper without giving him credit much less paying a cent -- is about as exciting as Kearns Wikipedia entry. Greg Kinnear usually kinetic is unusually (and unbearably) dull in producer turned director Marc Abrahams telling of Kearns years-long fight to regain his good name even as Ford finally offers millions to get him to scram. Is Kearns mad or just angry? Hard to say as the filmmaker and actor cant get a handle on a man obsessed with windshield wipers and the attendant credit thats rightfully his. The movies so even-keeled that the cast -- including Lauren Graham as the tolerant wife who suddenly snaps and then just vanishes altogether -- seems to be getting sleepy sleepy sleepy as it winds its way toward a courtroom showdown thats more slowdown. You know how itll all end -- Hollywood doesnt make movies in which Goliath trounces David especially when hes Greg Kinnear -- so all youre left with are windshield wipers going back and forth ... and back and forth ... and back and forth. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)  THE HOUSE OF ADAM Suspecting that hes being robbed the owner of a small-town diner asks his married son Anthony (John Shaw) to return from college to spy on his only employee Adam (Jared Cadwell). Within three minutes of screen time Anthony cuts himself in the kitchen Adam grinningly sticks the bloody finger in his mouth the two walk along babbling creeks together and Adam reveals -- as he has to nobody else -- that hes gay. Soon after Anthony cops to both the embezzlement and bi-curiosity his dying father entrusts his cabin to Adam and -- one year and a divorce later -- Anthony is Adams lover and a police detective. Then Adam is beaten to death with a Bible by beefcake religious fanatics enabling Anthony to move into the house -- now owned by another couple -- and find his beloveds remains. Jorge Ameers laughably unskilled drama (acting thats the opposite of natural confused music cues colors that dont match between each hideously framed shot production values rivaling late-night Cinemax softcore cheapies mildly supernatural events) is so poorly written and directed that it could be a fake movie within a John Waters camp classic. How else to explain such a waste of time escaping the LBGT-festival circuit? (Sunset 5) (Aaron Hillis) HOW TO LOSE FRIENDS AND ALIENATE PEOPLE Based on Toby Youngs tome about his spectacular fuck-ups and flame-out at Vanity Fair Robert Weides big-screen version is sitcom-drab. Simon Pegg plays Young reducing the writer -- in the book version a narcissistic twat who aspired to be Cary Grant in His Girl Friday sans the looks or talent -- to nothing more than a barely functioning idiot a cretin clad in a ""Young Dumb and Full of Come"" T-shirt whose loutishness is outmatched only by his inability to function as a human being. Worse the storys been turned into a romantic comedy in which Simon woos his considerably smarter though no less self-absorbed superior Alison Olsen (Kirsten Dunst) whos fucking an editor (Danny Huston) who seems to be speaking in four different accents at once none of them quite of the English variety. It plays like a made-for-CBS redo of The Devil Wears Prada which was likewise set at a Manhattan glossy but also happened to contain some genuinely insightful observations about the perils of workplace success. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky) MENTOR As aging novelist and graduate professor Sanford Pollard Rutger Hauer shares a vocation a shaggy gray haircut and a pair of tortoiseshell frames with the Michael Douglas character from Curtis Hansons Wonder Boys. Like Douglas Grady Tripp Pollard juggles relationships with his students carrying on a romantic liaison with the class assistant (Dagmara Dominczyk) while becoming guru to a talented young writer (Matt Davis). But whereas Douglass defining characteristic in Wonder Boys was his midlife fatigue Pollard is notable for his abusive mind games and penchants for cocaine and predatory sex. You didnt think they hired Rutger Hauer to play Mr. Chips did you? With Hauer as cruel ringmaster an erotic triangle develops and eventually it feels as if director David Carl Lang has welded the plot of Indecent Proposal onto Wonder Boys world of bourgeois academia. All the bedroom action apparently transforms Pollards young protege into a great novelist although Davis appears no less boyish and clueless at the end of the film than he does in the beginning. Lang tells us that hanging around someone like Pollard will turn you into a great writer but its hard to accept Hauer as anything other than a despicable prick. Mentor might have rung truer had it allowed Pollard to stay a monster rather than redeeming him in a predictably heartwarming climax. (Grande 4-Plex) (Sam Sweet) NICK amp; NORAHS INFINITE PLAYLIST Peter Solletts 2002 film Raising Victor Vargas remains among the most pointed poignant and joyful films about teen love ever made. Everything about it felt special from its depictions of the Lower East Side of Manhattan to its cast then-newcomers who seemed to radiate from within as they groped and coped beneath watchful eyes. Now Sollett can only retrace those footsteps in this far lesser movie about little more than a boy (Michael Cera once more in the Michael Cera role) a girl (Kat Dennings) and their friends cruising the streets of NYC in search of the latest greatest hippest band in all the land (a band we never see or hear incidentally which shorts the audience of at least one promised reward for making it to the movies end). From its indier-than-thou soundtrack -- larded with the likes of Vampire Weekend Bishop Allen and Band of Horses -- to its split-second hipster cameos (Devendra Banhart Seth Meyers John Cho Kevin Corrigan) this after-hours romantic comedy plays like the exact opposite of Victor Vargas Where that movie was organic with every scene hitting just the right note and feeling so magically accidental Nick amp; Norah is like something crafted in a lab by 54-year-old hucksters trying to sell shit to the kids under the cheerless guise of ""alternative."" The only thing its an alternative to? Good. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)  GO  OBSCENE Barney Rosset is a tragic hero. He says so himself at the end of Obscene stating -- by way of a colleagues parting shot -- what the previous 90 minutes of Neil Ortenberg and Daniel OConnors very fine documentary make unstintingly and yet wistfully clear. Beginning with Rossets 1989 appearance on a delightfully vulgar cable-access show and a question about how he managed to lose his publishing imprint Grove Press in an unexpectedly hostile buyout Obscene then reels back some 50 years tracing the Chicago origins of a kid who grew up to fight perhaps the preeminent publishing battle of the 20th century censorship. Much of the film and photographic material is culled from Rossets stunningly replete archives and an assortment of artists publishers and literati appears to champion and chide the man who first brought Lady Chatterleys Lover Tropic of Cancer and Naked Lunch to the starving bosoms of the American public. Having sold off every acre of his prime Hamptons real estate in an attempt to keep Grove afloat through the 60s instead of jillionaire-hood and publishing-board eminency the 86-year-old today settles for the modest life of a cult figure with some kick left; his lit-and-naked-ladies journal The Evergreen Review now exists online. (Sunset 5) (Michelle Orange) SMOTHER Noah (Dax Shepard) just got fired faces pressure from his wife (Liv Tyler) to have a baby and must contend with her socially inept cousin (Mike White) who wants to stay with them for a few days while he finishes his screenplay. Thats when Marilyn (Diane Keaton) Noahs high-maintenance mother announces shes moving in turning Noahs bad day into a presumably hilarious and awful one. Directed and co-written by Vince Di Meglio Smother aspires to an edgy style of non-sequitur humor where the situations arent particularly funny or original but do allow enough room for throwaway jokes and bizarre running gags. The problem with this flimsy narrative approach is that the films laugh quotient depends entirely on whatever the cast can bring to the tired setup. In that regard Smother is fortunate -- Shepard is dependably low-key White goes a long way with his creepy-smile stare and Keaton demonstrates boundless charm when she isnt restrained by the cliches of her nagging needy character. Still with its mixture of high-profile talent and low-watt comic inspiration Smother feels like the sort of misbegotten curiosity Comedy Central uses to fill its Sunday afternoon programming. And considering how quietly Smothers distributor dumped it into theaters expect to see it there soon. (AMC Burbank; One Colorado; Fallbrook 7) (Tim Grierson) GO  STILL LIFE More than two years after winning the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival one year after a single local screening during UCLAs annual showcase of new Chinese cinema and nine months after opening commercially in New York director Jia Zhangkes Still Life finally receives a full weeks run at one Los Angeles cinema. Set and shot in Fengjie a real Chinese town that was being dismantled and demolished as Jia was filming in 2006 to make way for the massive Three Gorges hydroelectric-dam project Still Life is the story of two people in transit -- a rural coal miner (Han Sanming) in search of the ex-wife and teenage daughter he hasnt seen in a decade and a woman (played by Jias frequent muse the luminous Zhao Tao) looking for her estranged engineer husband. The two story lines parallel one another without ever intersecting each of them affording Jia and his ace cinematographer Yu Lik Wai (shooting once again in crisp high-definition video) to commemorate the disappearing Fengjie landscape -- and with it a few thousand years of Chinese history -- in all its decrepit gutted-out majesty. Everywhere Jia looks he sees the clash between Chinas past and its rapidly accelerating present Men in hazard uniforms with spray cans make their zombielike way through the ruins. A demolition team unearths artifacts dating from the Han dynasty. A gutted building literally blasts off into the stratosphere like a rocket ship to the moon. Ive said before in these pages that Jia (whose previous films include The World Unknown Pleasures and Platform) is the greatest Chinese filmmaker of his generation. In Still Life his great subject -- that of a nation making ""progress"" faster than its own people can keep up with it -- reaches its fullest and most painfully beautiful expression yet. Simply one of the best films of last year this year or any year likely to come. (Music Hall) (SF)THE VIOLENT KIND In its attempt to convey the psychological unraveling of a soldier returning home from Iraq The Violent Kind forgoes narrative structure in favor of hallucinatory malaise. The action revolves around a cabin in Montana where Iraq veteran Terry Malloy (Kirk Harris) reunites with his Vietnam vet father (Jon Savage of The Deer Hunter) and attractive young wife (Irina Bjorkland). The nondescript wilderness symbolizes the netherworld in which both father and son find themselves trapped but over the course of the film the pattern of surreal and grotesque images -- a carcass floating in gray stew; a musical performance by robed white-faced phantoms -- feels less like a haunting and more like mumbo jumbo. Director Geoffrey Pepos wants to show that posttraumatic stress causes combat veterans to destroy themselves and the people they love but he has little interest in unpacking his characters war experiences beyond cliches. Terry Malloy (the allusion to On the Waterfront is both cheap and irrelevant) talks in voice-over about his experiences with ""his boys"" back in the platoon (""You gotta believe in the guy next to you ..."") while Dad brandishes guns at imaginary ""gooks."" Both men exist only as war-movie figments set adrift in a picture that confuses a chaotic psyche with what is simply chaotic filmmaking.

In Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) decide to spend an evening in New York City looking for a band they both love. Photo K.C. BAILEY COLUMBIA PICTURES Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist 1 / 1 Back to Gallery SO theres this nerd named Nick (Michael Cera). And theres this gal named Norah (Kat Dennings). Norah knows nothing about Nick except that he makes mix-CDs for his snotty ex-girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena) who dumps them in the high school trash bin as casually as she dumped him on his birthday. Norah retrieves the CDs listens to them grooves on them and thus comprehends the Deep and Abiding Truth of Nick He has awesome taste in music. One night Nick takes his beat-up taxi-yellow Yugo into Manhattan for a club gig with his queercore band a cheerful punk trio with several revolving names (none repeatable here). Tris and Norah are both in the crowd. After the gig Tris gets snide about Norahs boyfriendlessness Norah gets defensive about Tris snideness and faking it Norah sidles up to Nick and smooches him full on the lips not realizing hes Tris ex. Whoops. He is shall we say nonplused. She is shall we say smitten. Then they realize they both love the same band Wheres Fluffy rumored to play later that night at a secret location somewhere in New York City. Should they look for it together? If they do spend the night trolling the haunts of NYC will they also find love? Finally Will Nicks gay bandmates (Aaron Yoo and Rafi Gavron) persuade Norah to swap her sports bra for a sexy item from their cross-dressing stash in the back of the van? Its yes to the first question maybe to the second and affirmative to the third in Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist an uneven but sweet-natured bop through the unstable ground of teenage lust and loneliness. Everyones rooting for Nick and Norah to get together (whatever that entails in this horndog age). Everyone that is but Tris and Tal (Jay Baruchel the sane guy in Tropic Thunder) Norahs own inadequate ex. Hes a ""friend with benefits"" whos not much of a friend and a bit pushy with the benefits. Directed by Peter Sollett (Raising Victor Vargas a scrappier look at young New York eros) Nick and Norah was adapted by Lorene Scafaria from the popular YA novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan. It arrives pre-canned for cult teen consumption. Consider it iPod and YouTube ready with its alt-trendy soundtrack (full of bumptious quirk-rock from Vampire Weekend Devendra Banhart and the like) and bantering grungy humor that trades on drunk friends (Ari Graynor) and misunderstandings (""This is not a cab my friend I promise you.""). Whats more it takes place in a world in which adults are largely absent -- a mysterious parallel universe analogous to recent release The Womens world without men. Its a nice enough place to visit for a night and I cant think of two cooler adolescent misfits Id rather accompany on an overnight club crawl. Dennings has only just scratched the surface of her abrasive and self-effacing gift Im sure. But Cera has done adorkable emo hipsters before -- look at Juno and Superbad -- and after this Id like him to move on. Grow a beard wield an ax something. (Rumor says he plays a hunter-gatherer in the upcoming Year One. Maybe thatll do it.) The movie is sprinkled with cameos Andy Samberg Seth Meyers John Cho and Banhart to name a few. Part of the fun is spotting them all while the leads skedaddle around Manhattan. But the ending left me frustrated and confused -- not with Nick and Norahs romance but with the real story the story of music as an ""infinite playlist"" defining and exploring matters of the heart. High Fidelity told that tale. Solletts film begins to then drops it like a tease. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Mainstays No Tools 6-Cube Storage Shelf for 20 + pickup at...

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Michael Cera shines brightest when he has a nova burning nearby. Think Ellen Page in ""Juno"" or foul-mouthed Jonah Hill in ""Superbad."" In the fizzy romp ""Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist"" he has a kleig light of a playmate in Kat Dennings (""Charlie Bartlett."") Nick -- a young thin man moping after his ex -- meets Norah at a club where he and his gay bandmates played with sweet verve by Aaron Yoo and Rafi Gavron are bringing the noise. Norah already knows of Nick and loves the moody brilliant slightly pathetic mix CDs he makes for his unappreciative ex (Alexis Dziena). In rom-com tradition they do and dont hit it off as they roam the city together looking for an elusive alt band called Fluffy. You know that kind of night. Most of you probably saved them for college. Namp;N are two undersupervised high-schoolers whom any parent would trust. As Norahs charismatic pal Caroline Ari Graynor does amusing work capturing the fleeting fun and clueless ugliness of drunkenness. Director Peter Sollett brings the authentic observation that worked wonders in his debut ""Finding Victor Vargas."" And its no surprise perhaps that Chris and Paul Weitz (Nick Hornsbys ""About a Boy"") produced. Directed by Peter Sollett; written by Lorene Scafaria; from the book by Rachel Cohn amp; David Levithan; photography by Tom Richmond; starring Michael Cera Kat Dennings Aaron Yoo Rafi Gavron Ari Graynor Alexis Dziena.

The documentary film was written and directed by Clay Tweel. Photo Open Road Films By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated July 30 2016 155 p.m. ET 3 COMMENTS The subject of Clay Tweels superb documentary feature is Steve Gleason the former New Orleans Saints safety who was diagnosed with ALS or Lou Gehrigs disease in 2011. Shortly afterward Mr. Gleason started chronicling the progress of his disease in a video diary but six weeks later he and his wife Michel learned she was pregnant. At that point the diary became for the most part a series of straight-to-the-camera messages to his son Rivers both before and after the birth. ""My intention"" he says at the outset when his speech is still unimpaired ""is to pass on as much of who I am as I possibly can to you."" What was meant as a gift to his son is a gift to anyone who watches the film which incorporates Mr. Gleasons home videos in a profile of almost unfathomable courage--hes still very much with us although his body has been ravaged by the disease--and a portrait of a profoundly good man. ENLARGE Michel Gleason Steve Gleason and Rivers Gleason. Photo Open Road Films ""Gleason"" is so powerful in its cumulative effect that it should be accompanied by a consumer advisory--something along the lines of ""This documentary may cause sudden alterations of mood and attitude."" I can attest to having been undone by at least one scene and Im far from an easy weeper; its a confrontation between Mr. Gleason and his own father a man with rigid notions of good and evil. The moment is at once heart-rending and transcendently beautiful and father-and-son themes play in parallel throughout the film or perhaps they intertwine in a double helix. Mr. Gleason is determined to be a better father for his son than his father was for him even though he must speak through a voice synthesizer by the time Rivers is starting to talk. More Reviews Jason Bourne Indignation Summer Movie Preview Interactive Watch trailers and read more about the summers crop of films The film is authentically inspiring but also unsparing in its depiction of the horrors of ALS and its impact on the family. (The implacable strength of Michel Gleason could be the subject of a separate film.) The disease moves swiftly attacking Steve Gleasons spirit as well as his body. There are times captured by the unblinking camera when his agonies seem unendurable yet he has rejected assisted suicide and chosen to live out a life that brings joy with the pain. In one conjunction of more emotions than can be put into words we see him struggling to breathe while he watches Rivers struggling to blow out all four candles on his birthday cake. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download The Theory of Everything (2014) Eddie Redmayne stars brilliantly as the cosmologist Stephen Hawking who at age 21 was diagnosed with a motor neuron disorder related to Lou Gehrigs disease and given two years to live. More than half a century later hes still going strong. See James Marshs movie as a companion piece to ""Gleason"" an enjoyable demonstration of the difference between nonfiction films that can enthrall and informative features that entertain. 353 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Comments Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist Recommended Boy meets girl boy loses girl boy gets girl and they make great music together. Its a familiar formula but as the title characters Michael Cera (Juno) and Kat Dennings give it such a fresh spin youd think they invented love at first sight. Nick a New Jersey senior who pines for his shallow ex-girlfriend (Alexis Dziena) is playing bass for a gay rock band when he meets Norah a rich but soulful Manhattanite whos wowed by his CD mixes. Recognizing each other as kindred spirits they decide to track down the elusive underground band they both love. Director Peter Sollett (Raising Victor Vargas) and cinematographer Tom Richmond transform nocturnal New York into a soft-focus wonderland for their sweet but screwball courtship. PG-13 90 min.

"Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist Misplaced ambitions | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsNick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist Misplaced ambitionsYou know a movie is in trouble when the title characters are shoved aside by the supporting players.Michael Cera replays his Paulie card from Juno in Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist to much less effect. Kat Dennings co-stars on the rom-com.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 3 2008 Nickamp;Norahs Infinite Playlist (out of 4)Starring Michael Cera Kat Dennings Ari Graynor Jay Baruchel Alexis Dziena and Aaron Yoo. Directed by Peter Sollett. 90 minutes. At major theatres. 14A You know a movie is in trouble when the title characters are shoved aside by the supporting players.In Nickamp;Norahs Infinite Playlist a romantic comedy based on a popular novel and directed by Peter Sollett with misplaced ambitions to be the next Juno it isnt so much a case of scene stealing as it is grand theft of the entire picture. As Nick a lovelorn Manhattan rock bassist with zero prospects Bramptons Michael Cera replays his sensitive nerd routine from Juno and Superbad strongly suggesting weve seen all he can offer.Nick is such a pathetic loser hes already on disc 12 of a series of music mix tapes hes calling ""Road to Closure"" which he keeps sending to his sayonara ex-girlfriend. (Natch the iTunes-friendly soundtrack is full of these sad-sack anthems.)As Norah the supposed live wire who is going to snap Nick out of his funk Kat Dennings simply fails to make a convincing connection even in a romance that begins with a brazenly stolen kiss. She likes Nicks taste in music - shes the accidental recipient of those mix tapes hes making - but she finds him to be about as cool as the battered yellow Yugo he drives the one everybody keeps mistaking for a taxi.The picture would flatline entirely were it not for the antics of all the people not named in the title. They help pad out a very thin story about pals on the prowl in New York City one long night in search of an elusive band cutely called Wheres Fluffy?The most insistent sideshow is Ari Graynor as Caroline Norahs drunken best friend who essentially makes her own movie. She gets separated from Nick and Norah and wanders around various Manhattan nightclubs and tourist spots looking for good places to throw up. She finds one in a Port Authority Bus Terminal washroom but her toilet antics are so disgusting she might instead provoke upchucks from the audience.Less extreme are Aaron Yoo as the leader of Nicks punk rock band The Jerk Offs (everyones gay except for Nick) Alexis Dziena as Nicks scheming former girlfriend (suddenly interested in Nick again now that Norahs around) and Jay Baruchel as the low-wattage thug du jour (he usually plays nerds like Cera). There are also fleeting cameos from Andy Samberg of TVs Saturday Night Live and John Cho who plays Harold in the Haroldamp;Kumar stoner movies.The knock against Nickamp;Norahs when it debuted at the recent Toronto International Film Festival was that it was a knock-off of Juno the romantic comedy phenom from TIFF07. Thats because screenwriter Lorene Scafaria is a close friend and writing partner of Juno scribe Diablo Cody.Yet apart from opening credits that are suspiciously Juno-ish and the presence of Cera in roles so similar they could almost be swapped the two movies couldnt be any less alike. Nickamp;Norahs only wishes it had some of Junos wit and energy.Ditto for director Sollett whose debut feature Raising Victor Vargas had so much more going for it including a story worthy of our time. That was five years ago when Sollett saw Manhattan through much darker lenses. He seems content now to make a glossy fantasy about Manhattan nightlife that has all the heft of an after-school special. His own infinite playlist seems a lot more finite all of a sudden.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Hes with the band Nicks queercore-rock outfit includes Aaron Yoo (left) as Thom and Rafi Gavron as Dev. Sony Pictures Nicks a sweet dweeby high-school kid with girlfriend problems -- a Michael Cera sort of guy basically so its nice that Michael Cera actually plays him. His girlfriend Tris walks all over him and as you can hear from the haplessly pathetic phone messages he leaves for her hes having trouble dealing. Left to his own devices Nick would just sit home and mope. But he plays in a band and theres a secret indie-rock concert he and the band are hoping to find somewhere in New York tonight. A lot of other kids are trying to find it too including Nora played by Kat Dennings as a smart sarcastic Catholic-school girl who does not want to appear dateless when shes spotted by what she would call a frenemy. So scanning the crowd Norah spots the least threatening guy -- that would be Nick -- asks him to be her boyfriend for five minutes and kisses him passionately. Which would be great except the frenemy who recognized her is ... Nicks girlfriend Tris. Having thus met cute Nick and Norah will spend the rest of the movie sparring cute trading quips and insults and at one point a punch that leaves Nick temporarily speechless. Happily things mellow along the way. (You can tell despite the sparring because Nick lets Nora check out both his car and his iPod.) But though these two really grow on you whats almost more remarkable than Nick Norah or their playlist (which may not be infinite but really does include some great music) is the quirky melting-pot world director Peter Sollett creates around them. Vibrant like New York youthful like the stars awkward like the characters theyre playing its unselfconsciously diverse. Nick for instance is the only straight member of his rock band a queercore group that in most movies would fade into the background -- but that here becomes more and more central. Norahs a Jewish girl in a Catholic school a fact that goes as unremarked as the suburban/urban and sophisticate/doofus character divides. Sex and alcohol figure in the film but in ways that are gratifyingly unexpected. And gum -- lord what happens with gum in this picture you will never ever forget. Nor I suspect will you forget Nick and Norah who cruise around a New York that seems as romantically supercharged as in any Woody Allen movie listening to that infinite playlist and falling for each other as audiences fall for them.

ABOUT THE MOVIENick and Norahs Infinite Playlist   1/2 (out of four) Stars Michael Cera Kat Dennings Jay Baruchel Aaron Yoo Ari GraynorDirector Peter SollettDistributor 20th Century FoxRating PG-13 for mature thematic material including teen drinking sexuality language and crude behaviorRunning time 1 hour 30 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Those of a particular generation consider After Hours the defining New York-based late-night saga. Now the Millennial generation has its own witty sleepless night in the Big Apple Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist. And while lighter its a surprisingly worthy successor to Martin Scorseses surrealistic 1985 film. CLIP Hit play on Nick and Norah Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) are about as perfect for each other as two 18-year-olds can be and they realize it along with the audience during the course of one music-fueled night in New York City. Not only do they have the same taste in bands theyre evenly matched on the intelligence and wit scale. Dennings is the revelation here having played supporting parts in The House Bunny and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. She is smart likable and funny and may be ready to assume the mantle from Junos Ellen Page as the coolest young female star. Cera is more recognizable to audiences after his major roles in last years Superbad and Juno. He plays a similarly sensitive and adorable teen here but familiarity only breeds contentment. The sharp-witted Norah is not sure about much but she is certain about her love for music. Nick is a lovelorn guy whose shallow former girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena) has toyed with his affections. He valiantly continues to make her a succession of mix CDs which she casually tosses out. Unbeknownst to Nick or Tris Norah has found the discs enjoyed the musical selections and created a fantasy about the guy who compiled them. Nick wouldnt necessarily fit the bill. Hes a little gawky and plays a lackluster bass in an indie rock band. He also is obsessed with a local cult band having a secret show in the city. Nora shares the obsession but spends much of her time bailing out her best buddy Caroline (a fearlessly funny Ari Graynor). Norah and Caroline are thrown together with Nick and his trio of bandmates on an odyssey through late-night New York. Though each plays an endearing character there also is considerable chemistry between Cera and Dennings. Though the movie rambles in the middle it gets back on track when Nick and Norah have a sweet encounter in an unexpected place. The soundtrack is an excellent counterpoint to the films quirky scenarios. Not only is their playlist worth a listen but Nick and Norah are surprisingly good company with whom to spend a long night in the city.

Neither knows this when social misfit Norah asks Nick a high-school senior and straight guitarist in a queercore band to pose as her boyfriend so that Tris will ease up on her. Nor do they know although we do that a common frenemy could be the start of a beautiful friendship. Some movies skate by fast on slick action. Others snap with crisp dialogue. Nick and Norah springs high on the bounce of its hugely likable leads Michael Cera and Kat Dennings. Together this appealing twosome he skinny as a drumstick and she shapely as a Fender Stratocaster make music danceable as the tracks on Nicks mix tapes. The movies 16 Candles-meets-After Hours plot - where in the five boroughs is the fictional band Wheres Fluffy playing? - is a convenient excuse just to hear its costars effortless riffs. While you may know Cera from Juno and Dennings from The 40-Year-Old Virgin you have not heard the comic harmonics of his nasal wisecracks and her deep-throated parries. This sophomore film from Peter Sollett who made the gritty East Village romance Raising Victor Vargas focuses on the New Jersey mallrats trolling the same urban frontier. Because Nick and Norahs landmarks are clubs and all-night restaurants largely unknown outside of New York it likewise has a fresh sense of place if an unapologetically upmarket orientation. Working from a screenplay by Lorena Scafaria who adapted the young-adult novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan Sollett rewrites the high school romantic gospel according to John Hughes. Rather than events that build up to a showdown at the prom the film shows how high schoolers behave outside the familiar social hierarchy. While Nick and Norah initially care about the opinion of Tris (Alexis Dziena) the farther they get from Hoboken (in Nicks taxicab-yellow Yugo) the less Tris matters. And the easier it is to listen to their palpitating hearts. Somebody must have thought this broth was too thin because its been thickened rather lumpily with a grossout plotline about Norahs drunken bud Caroline (Ari Graynor) remarkably committed to her chewing gum. But can someone answer this headscratcher Why does Norah who repeatedly identifies as Jewish attend Catholic school? Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist  (out of four stars) Directed by Peter Sollett written by Lorene Scafaria based on the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan.

Movies for about and starring teenagers are so commonplace you might suspect the entire film industry was suffering from acne. But it was not ever thus. In fact before the invention of the Brat Pack (and John Hughes movies) in the 80s bankable stars under the age of 25 were few and very far between.In fact in 1980 I collaborated on a screenplay about life on a hippie commune circa 1970. All the major roles had to be cast with kids between 18 and 25. And at that time there was only one certified star in that category John Travolta. (Needless to say the movie didnt get made an even bigger problem than the casting was the subject matter--at that moment in time movies about the 60s were at the top of Hollywoods Must Not Do list.)There were teen movies in the 50s and 60s of course but they tended to be either disreputable B-movie fodder for a niche audience (""I Was a Teenage Werewolf"") or wholesome family films in the Disney mold. A movie like ""Juno""--both Oscar-nominated and a big hit with a teenage-girl star--was inconceivable. Now of course the entire summer season is aimed at the youth market for they are the fans who rush out of the house on opening weekend. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Most of these movies about kids are fantasies designed to exploit the teen market. Every once in a while however a movie arrives that actually explores the reality of teen life. Such a movie a few years back was ""Raising Victor Vargas"" a low-budget exploration of Bronx Latino life that marked the auspicious debut of director Peter Sollett. After a long wait Sollett is back with a new teen movie ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist."" It stars cute/nerd ""it"" boy Michael Cera (""Juno"" and ""Superbad"") as Nick and Kat Dennings as Norah two musically hip New Jersey suburban teens who discover over the course of an adventurous night in the Big Apple that they are made for each other.""Nick amp; Norah"" is clearly more mainstream and formulaic than ""Victor Vargas."" From the get-go its romantic destination is never in doubt. But Sollett is able to take familiar teen tropes and transform them into low-key magic. The wittily selfeffacing Nick is introduced in the throes of romantic agony having been jilted by his high-school girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dzinea). She being blond popular and beautiful possesses all the classic signifiers of a Mean Girl. Norah on the other hand is smart brunette and Jewish with impeccable taste in indie rock bands. (As the critic Ruby Rich whispered to me during the screening ""At last a movie that makes being Jewish sexy"") Before shes even met Nick or knows who he is shes heard the mix tapes hes made for his girlfriend and senses a soulmate in waiting. Usually in these stories one or both of the lovers would be a rejected outcast--a Cinderella waiting for the right prince to turn her from drudge to beauty--but neither Nick nor Norah falls into the usual categories. Theyre not in the in crowd but theyre cool smart un-victimy. She in fact seems to have some sort of special access to the best music bars in New York--for reasons that will be revealed late in the movie and give us a fuller sense of who she is.Nick is a member of a band the Jerk Offs. The other two members Thom (Aaron Yoo) and Dev (Rafi Gavron) are gay and over the course of the night in which they all career across the East Village in search of the secret location of their favorite underground bands gig theyll serve as matchmakers helping to get Nick out of his funk and into the arms of the more appropriate Norah. Shes got her own ex pursuing her (Jay Baruchel)--an arrogant Mr. Wrong. Their odyssey is further complicated by Norahs vodka-guzzling girlfriend Caroline (Ari Graynor) who spends almost the entire movie in a state of escalating intoxication. Caroline gets lost in the city and finds herself at the Port Authority where Sollett indulges in an obligatory gross-out moment Caroline by now sick as a dog drops her cell phone and her gum into a toilet that looks to be borrowed from the set of ""Train-spotting."" Graynor is someone to watch she wrings virtuoso variations on drunkenness without ever wearing out her welcome--no mean feat.Except for that toilet Sollett doesnt amp up his slender plot for easy laughs or fake suspense. The movie has a genuine unforced sweetness. Its charm is in the details the attitude the slowly building chemistry between Cera (a master of stone-faced irony) and the beguiling Dennings. Lorene Scafarias script based on a young-adult novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan has real wit. Nick and Norahs sharp self-conscious repartee has a snappiness thats closer to the way real suburban teenagers speak than the baroque one-liners Diablo Cody put in the mouth of Juno (not to mention every other character in that movie appropriate or not). ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" in its quiet way captures the first-time-around exhilaration of teen life--that moment when you spread your wings and take unexpected flight. It wont break any box-office records--its not punchy enough--but its easy to imagine it developing a passionate cult following. If we must have teen movies let them all be as sweet and seductive as Solletts smartly observed romance.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Say Anything Sixteen Candles The Sure Thing those kind of films - to describe them as anything other than just out-and-out good movies is to diminish their quality. Young audiences recognize themselves in them and adults see an honest portrayal of their youth - or at least as they would like to remember it. Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist aims for that lofty stature and very nearly attains it. It has seemingly everything going for it a hip somewhat inscrutable title; two appealing leads in Michael Cera and Kat Dennings; and a self-consciously cool soundtrack (music is integral to the plot of the film). It comes up a little short of the classic it might have become but its still a knowing portrayal of young love lost and found. And it has Vampire Weekend on the soundtrack. Nothing not to like about that. The film opens with Nick (Cera) leaving a hilariously pathetic phone message - one of many - for Tris (Alexis Dziena) the ice queen who dumped him. She doesnt call back so he makes a succession of outstanding mix CDs nakedly chronicling his emotions. Tris beautiful and self-centered has been tossing them in the trash without a listen; Norah (Dennings) fishes them out listens to them loves them. Nicks bandmates persuade him to try to escape his funk by playing a show in New York City. Naturally Tris is there with another guy. Meanwhile Norah persuades a distracted Nick to pose as her boyfriend long enough to convince Tris that she is indeed capable of getting a date. Norahs not particularly convincing but she does discover that this is the guy who has been making the cool mix CDs. A radio station is teasing a surprise show by a local band called Wheres Fluffy dropping hints about the secret location. Nick Norah Tris and all their friends love the band so the night turns into a sleepless trek around New York looking for both the show and in a secondary plot Norahs wasted friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) whos making all sorts of regrettable choices. (After one scene you may never chew gum again.) There are nice details here - Nicks taxi-cab-yellow Yugo (which is indeed mistaken for a taxi) Norahs mysteriously being recognized by the bouncers at every club in town the taken-for-granted sexuality of Nicks bandmates (its a queercore band with an unprintable name). And Nick and Norah recognizes that when it comes to making friends nothing - nothing - is more of a bonding agent (or a deal-breaker) than cool taste in music. Joy of discovery all that. But although Cera and Dennings are immensely likable actors individually their chemistry together is nothing special. Indeed Lorene Scafarias script based on the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan throws up obstacles that seem designed to take the spark out of their burgeoning relationship. It improves over time but you wish director Peter Sollett had been able to coax more out of their earlier scenes together. Ultimately Nick and Norah is like the playlists its title suggests - some scenes are hits but as with most mix tapes its somewhat uneven overall.

"Movie review Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist -- 4 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Check out the latest theme park experiences and attractions Business Business Movie review Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist -- 4 out of 5 stars Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) are two people thrust together for one hilarious sleepless night of adventure in a world of mix tapes late-night living and live loud music. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist is one of those magical near-perfect youth romances a film that so vividly reminds you of the glories of young love that you wish you were 18 again full of hope not jaded by life and love lost. Sassy savvy and wistful it throws two strangers together for one wild unsupervised night in Manhattan a night of searching for a lost drunken friend and a mysterious mythic band about to play an impromptu gig of nightclubs that apparently never card anybody because these kids are too young to drink.But thats OK. Theyre both ""straight edge"" types as in edgy hip kids who dont do drugs booze or tobacco. Nick ( Michael Cera) has just been dumped. Norah (Kat Dennings adorable) is alone ""again"" at a bar where Nicks band is playing. She goes to school with Nicks ex Tris (Alexis Dziena elievably needy and cruel). Shes been picking Nicks soulful mix CDs out of a trash can the trashy Tris has dumped them in. Imagine her surprise that the guy she begs ""Be my boyfriend for five minutes"" just to impress Tris turns out to be the sensitive cute but still shell-shocked Nick.Norah has a pal Caroline transformed by actress Ari Graynor into the funniest underage blond drunk in New York City. She goes off with Nicks gay bandmates (a cute touch) who lose her. And Nick and Norah -- whom the band (Aaron Yoo and Rafi Gavron) )and we know were meant to be together but who cant seem to connect -- must dash hither and yon through the night in Nicks battered yellow Yugo which every drunk in Soho thinks is a taxi. Theres a lot more of Juno about this Peter Sollett film of the Rachel Cohn/David Levithan novel than just the casting of the boy-nextdoor Cera in it. The dialogue is glib and too-too cute full of put downs and hipster-kid jargon about ""JAPS"" (Jewish American Princesses which Norah kinda/sorta is) and ""bridge and tunnel"" boys (non-Manhattanites).Shes "" Englewood up to no good"" and hes ""Hoboken no jokin."" Itll never work.Except that we know it will despite the wild odyssey Caroline leads them on staggering from train station to gutter to toilet re-using the most disgusting stick of chewing gum in the history of the Big Apple.Its smart. Its romantic. Its not coarse crude sexist or homophobic. Its High Fidelity meets Sixteen Candles not that your average teen will spot that. But they wont need to. Nick and Norah is now their generations Say Anything. Dont let them keep it to themselves.

"Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; nick-and-norah-s-infinite-playlist ) Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Its strange how the concept of two people wandering around a city at night falling in love has come of age in 2008. First there was In Search of a Midnight Kiss. Now theres Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist. Of course Richard Linklater can claim to have pioneered the idea more than a decade ago with Before Sunrise but where the Ethan Hawke/Julie Delpy romantic comedy targeted adults Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist is geared more toward teens although that wont prevent older viewers with an affinity for romance from appreciating the vibes it gives off. Nick and Noras Infinite Playlist is being marketed as 2008s answer to Juno although thats a stretch. Liking one film doesnt guarantee an affinity for the other. Plotwise the pictures dont have a lot in common but the prominence of Michael Cera in both makes it difficult to defuse comparisons. In fact Cera appears to be playing pretty much the same character he portrayed in Juno (and in every other production in which he has appeared) a laid-back earnest ""nice guy."" In casting Cera filmmakers have certain expectations and he delivers. The actors Nick is sufficiently different from the books version that a little reworking was required to allow for the less demonstrative personality. Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist is shaped like a kinder gentler After Hours with a little of the aforementioned Before Sunrise thrown in for good measure. Its a romantic comedy for the iPod generation and has a soundtrack that will threaten to be heard in greater numbers than those who see the movie. The premise is simple enough. Nick (Cera) is still pining after his ex-girlfriend Tris (Alexis Dziena the naked girl from Broken Flowers) long after she dumped him. One Friday night his buddies drag him out on the town (the ""town"" being New York City) in search of the secret site where his favorite band Wheres Fluffy is playing a gig. Also going on this treasure hunt is Norah (Kat Dennings) who has a sort-of long-distance crush on Nick. Nick and Norah end up at the same club as Tris who begins to toss verbal darts at Norah about her not having a boyfriend. Norah impulsively retorts that she has one and nominates Nick for the role by kissing the nonplused guy on the lips. Tris is shocked and her interest in Nick is re-kindled by his sudden unavailability. (For Tris its all about the chase.) Meanwhile Nick and Norah forced together by circumstances go in search not only of Wheres Fluffy but Norahs drunk friend Caroline (Ari Graynor) who is missing in Manhattan. At its heart Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist is a romantic comedy and it never loses sight of that. To that end it accomplishes the two most important things any such film must do gets us to like the characters as individuals and to like them even more as a couple. Theres ample chemistry between laid-back Nick and spunky Norah and the two are given sufficient screen time together to allow it to smolder and smoke before catching fire. The relationship develops as the characters roll through a series of comically tinged misadventures before solidifying during the last 20 minutes when Nick and Norah alone at last are allowed to have their Before Sunrise moments. This is when the movie gels into something more magical than a generic teen road comedy. The dialogue is witty enough to separate Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist from the rom-com continuum of dumb screenplays but not so witty that it will receive a Diablo Cody-level backlash. Director Peter Sollett adapting from Rachel Cohn and David Levithans novel adeptly fashions a cinematic seduction that will appeal to both mainstream movie-goers and those who demand a little more. Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist is fresh without being alien and fun without being moronic. There are perhaps a few too many secondary characters and subplots and I could have done without the story of the traveling chewing gum. (Cautionary note next time you swap gum with anyone be sure you know where it has been.) Overall however its hard to deny that the film is able to touch both the heart and the funny bone. Combine that with two winning lead performances and a top-notch soundtrack and its hard not to be bullish about Nick and Norahs city-bound road trip in a Yugo.

Here for the umpteenth time are a couple of young people who straddle the borders between hipster and geek insider and outsider reasonably well-adjusted teen and roiling mess of adolescent self-doubt. And on one enchanted night driving around in a Yugo the pumpkin color of Cinderellas coach after midnight they find each other. But here too for the first time in a long time are characters who seem honestly rooted in an authentic kids-of-08 universe. Welcome to a world that may feel like a discovery to any viewer not currently a teen habitue of New Yorks downtown melting pot of straights and gays and Jews and goys and NYC sophisticates and bridge-and-tunnel gatecrashers awake at all hours and open to the improvisation and velocity of the new. Seniors Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) come from different backgrounds -- hes a son of suburban New Jersey the one straight dude in a queercore rock band; shes a privileged city-dwelling daughter of a record-industry mogul. At first the pair dont realize that they fit together like the original Nick and Nora in the peerless Thin Man screwball comedies of the 1930s and 40s this time bound together by a connoisseurs love of indie rock hole-in-the-wall Lower East Side clubs that pound all night a fierce ability to banter and a luminous goodness. When the two meet cute at one such club Nick is nursing a bruised heart -- a Cera specialty -- injured by a shallow bee-yotch named Tris (Alexis Dziena). Norah who has got a mooching wannabe-musician boyfriend (Jay Baruchel) somewhere in the wings knows Tris as a private school classmate and longtime frenemy but thats not the point At the moment Norah is accompanying her hard-partying best friend Caroline (fearless and funny Ari Graynor) in pursuit of an elusive underground band rumored to be playing somewhere in the city late that night. Its Nicks gay pals who actually recognize that Norah is the girl worthy of their hetero buddy and the boys engineer the getting-to-know- you circumstances right down to providing the sullenly pretty droopily dressed Norah with foundation garments to enhance her delicious figure. It takes a gay man to offer a woman straight talk about her ""uniboob."" But one of Nick amp; Norahs most radical accomplishments is to incorporate a population of interesting creative cute gay guys who lead fulfilled lives that have nothing to do with being any straight persons colorful sidekick. (Its a stunning feat really tossed off with ease by director Peter Sollett and screenwriter Lorene Scafaria working from the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan.) Another achievement is granting Norah a Jewish identity thats as much an unremarkable unshticky part of who she is as the fact that shes cool she loves rock and she doesnt drink. And a third is that in the zonked-out person of Caroline (and in the gonzo risks taken by Graynor an accomplished New York stage actor) the movie offers a whole new feminist angle on the joys of gross-out humor. Wild horses or a speeding Yugo couldnt drag from me the details of Carolines greatest descent into transgressive yuccckkk; the whole scene is a tribute to Graynors gumption with help from the fluorescent-lit tattiness of Manhattans Port Authority Bus Terminal where it all goes down. But come to think of it so much goes down on Nick and Norahs one enchanted evening that the best advice is to enjoy the ride -- the actual ride -- around this vibrant new New York. A?

""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" is in the special ed class compared to those valedictorians but it has a dogged all-night charm and a sense of who its audience is. As a comedy the movie is so thin that its entire complement of funny lines pretty much fits on the poster. (""I refuse to be the goody bag at your pity party"" channels the spirit of ""Juno"" - as does the font on the poster and the male lead.) The plot isnt much either. Nick (Michael Cera of ""Superbad"") is in a band. He drives a yellow Yugo from his New Jersey home into the city while mooning over the popular preppy girl Tris (Alexis Dziena) who dumped him. After about four flavors of coincidence he and the queen bees less popular private-school classmate Norah spend a long Friday night talking arguing flirting and driving around downtown Manhattan while following the trail of their favorite underground band. Cera whose fiercely withdrawn presence and stumbling delivery make him something like the Bob Newhart of his generation remains easy to like though. And he plays well off his co-star. Norah is Kat Dennings a striking actress who nevertheless looks approachable enough that she can successfully play the nonglamorous girl. She is engaging smart and completely natural an instant star in whom the girls in the audience will be able to picture themselves. The boys will want to send her a mix tape a habit of Nicks that hasnt won him back Tris but started to intrigue Norah before she ever met him. When Norah shows interest in Nick Tris suddenly starts flinging herself at him too which makes the film despite its aura of quirk more or less a rewrite of the standard Jane Austen/chick lit plot Which one of the two moneyed honeys will our poor hero wind up with? The kids are all a bit too sure of themselves but the target audience wont mind. High school is a frantic struggle to extricate yourself from Planet Childhood trying to figure out sex while pretending you already know everything about it and a couple of scenes get that point across painfully well especially one in which Tris tries to lure Nick back with an erotic dance. What makes the film more than watchable? A great soundtrack and identifiable characters can take you a long way even when not a lot is happening. ""American Graffiti"" didnt have much of a script either. NICK amp; NORAHS INFINITE PLAYLIST Kat-powered. Running time 90 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity teen drinking sexuality crude behavior).

People with high blood pressure need romantic comedies too and their cardiologists will be very grateful for ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" a scrubbed-up nearly somnambulistic night tour of teen-hipster Manhattan. This is the kind of sparsely plotted comedy that depends on compelling characters but it stars two young actors defined by ironic detachment. Michael Cera and Kat Dennings may bring some young behinds to theater seats but the number will be finite as the pics energy level is too low for breakout B.O. That said its refreshing to see a youth-oriented comedy that doesnt presume its audience has attention deficit disorder and that believes editing should be determined by a sense of logic or even by music. ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" (no connection or reference to Dashiell Hammetts Nick and Nora Charles) strives to give its characters emotional breathing room. Cera doing what hes done in ""Juno"" and ""Superbad"" plays Nick alt-rock bassist high school student and ex of the evil Tris (Alexis Dziena) for whom he spends his days making moony mix CDs. Norah (Dennings) who despises Tris and adores this unknown boyfriend who makes the mix CDs has no luck at love. But shes recognized on sight by every nightclub doorman in the East Village and Brooklyn (her pedigree is kept secret until later) and her ability to cut lines is equaled only by Nicks ability to find a parking space for his taxi-yellow Yugo directly in front of any place he and his posse happen to be going. (This is a fantasy of course so one shouldnt be persnickety about motor-vehicle sci-fi.) In the hands of director Peter Sollett (whose acclaimed 2002 indie ""Raising Victor Vargas"" took a less glamorous view of Gotham) and scribe Lorene Scafaria (adapting a novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan) the romantic direction in which the film is headed is never a mystery. Nor is it a mystery that a movie like this is inevitably going to be dependent on its peripheral characters The standout is Ari Graynor as Caroline Norahs cocktail-guzzling pal who spends most of the film in a drunken tizzy trying to navigate dance floors and ultimately the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Therepic reaches its aesthetic low point when Caroline fishes her cell phone and chewing gum out of a toilet that might have been borrowed from ""Trainspotting."" The characters spend much of the movie hunting down a band called Wheres Fluffy whose whereabouts are teased on the radio (in what seems to be a reference to ""American Graffiti"") sending Nick Norah and their pals on an inter-borough hunt. Along the way Nick and Norah are both tempted by ex loves -- Nick by Tris and Norah by the opportunistic Tal (Judd Apatow regular Jay Baruchel). This is a formula film inasmuch as Nick and Norah initially have all the chemistry of Clorox and ammonia but gradually warm to each other realizing the depths of their simpatico worldviews and musical tastes. Its also a film for tourists -- there are so many glistening skylines beautiful people and landmark commercial institutions  all shown in glossy advert style that in terms of promoting New York tourism ""Nick amp; Norahs Infinite Playlist"" makes ""Sex and the City"" seem like ""Fort Apache The Bronx."" Its sweet no doubt but a bit too slick for its own good. Production values are tops.
