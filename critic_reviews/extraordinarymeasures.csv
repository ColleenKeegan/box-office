From Indiana Jones to the maverick scientist in a glorified disease-of-the-week movie Harrison Ford may well be easing towards career twilight. Luxury casting is primarily what differentiates this true-life drama from afternoon-TV filler but to be fair the real-life Crowley family have a remarkable story to tell. A sales exec for a pharmaceuticals giant John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) is married with three kids and would be living the all-American success story except that his two youngest suffer from a rare neuromuscular syndrome called Pompes disease which gravely curtails their life expectancy. Refusing to sit and watch his kids die he seeks out medical opinion in the hope of developing a treatment in actuality various people were involved but the film reduces it to Fords surly individualist Dr Robert Stonehill whose theoretical discoveries lead the field but remain untested.Scottish director Tom Vaughans approach extracts the obvious emotional impact from plucky but seemingly doomed kids and their frantic parents without ever overdoing it and the same goes for the cast who do the necessary but keep it relatively tasteful. Stolid competence reigns throughout though as a chronicle of against-the-odds medical endeavour the whole thing proves slightly superficial and dramatically rather less arresting than say Lorenzos Oil. What does emerge however is a useful chronicle of the process of getting any medicine from lab to patient a process powered by the profit motive of course. So the story pits a fathers desperation against the clinical objectivity of the corporate pharmaceuticals industry (Jared Harris is excellent as a stern-hearted suit) though perhaps surprisingly never quite bows to sentimental gush in its assessment of the close relationship between big money and progress. Moderately illuminating in parts but the cliches of cinematic suffering tend to overwhelm it.

By Peter Rainer Film critic January 22 2010 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Extraordinary Measures movie review If ""The Blind Side"" is any indication inspirational movies ""inspired by real events"" are potential bonanzas in these parlous times. Im sure the people behind ""Extraordinary Measures"" which includes its star and coproducer Harrison Ford are hoping lightning will strike twice. But just being ""real"" and ""inspirational"" is no guarantee of a good movie. I wasnt nuts about ""The Blind Side"" - it skimmed over just about every area of potential controversy - and ""Extraordinary Measures"" doesnt cut it for me either. Its based on a book called ""The Cure How a Father Raised 100 Million and Bucked the Medical Establishment in a Quest to Save His Children"" and that says it all. Sort of. In fact the movie is a kind of odd-couple love fest. John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) is the rising corporate-star father who seeks out curmudgeonly Dr. Robert Stonehill (Ford) who is doing cutting-edge research into the degenerative Pompe disease which is killing two of Crowleys kids. Director Tom Vaughan dotes shamelessly on little Megan (Meredith Droeger) in particular. Crowleys wife Aileen (Keri Russell) is mostly a pretty foil for her husband who will stop at nothing to find a cure or at least slow down the disease. Big Pharma gets a surprisingly free pass in this film which will come as a surprise to all those sufferers struggling to get orphan drugs developed. Brendan Fraser is enjoyable but Ford still in his late Indiana Jones phase grimaces and growls a lot. Theres something off-putting about this films optimism After all how many people can afford to do what Crowley did? Grade C+ (Rated PG for thematic material language and a mild suggestive moment.)

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The Medicine Goes Down Extraordinary Measures is a heaping and palatable dose of showbiz altruism. By David Edelstein Published Jan 24 2010 ShareThis (Photo Merie Wesimille Wallace/Courtesy of CBS Films) Theres a fundamental tension in the true-ish drama Extraordinary Measures that lifts it above the formula disease-of-the-week picture. Brendan Fraser plays John Crowley an executive at Bristol-Myers Squibb with a daughter and son who have the rare Pompe disease a cousin to muscular dystrophy that fatally weakens musclesincluding the biggie the heart. Although Crowley works for Big Pharma theres no discussion in the movie of his particular companys doing research for a cure. Pompe is an orphan disease which means giant pharmaceutical and biotech entities have little financial incentive to pay attention to it. Instead the distraught Crowley tracks down Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford) a cranky scientist in Nebraska with big ideas but few resources. With the clock ticking on his childrens lives Crowley forms a company with Stonehill and goes in search of venture capital. He has to convince corporate bottom-liners that despite his personal stake he can coolly calculate profit margins and patient acceptable loss percentages. When a bigger company buys his own and theres finally a drug to test he learns his dying daughter and son are too old for the trials. Treating them wouldnt be cost-effective. The real Crowley as portrayed in Wall Street Journal reporter Geeta Anands 2006 book The Cure might agree with Michael Moore on the doggone unfairness of it all but he rarely questions the economic system that makes him rich while letting his kids die. (A Harvard Business School graduate Crowley toyed with the idea of running for the U.S. Senate in 2008 on the Republican ticket.) Robert Nelson Jacobss screenplay doesnt address that grim capitalist irony directly either but Jacobs and director Tom Vaughan build every scene around it. Fords Stonehill is fictionala compositeand his confrontations with Crowley come down to pure science versus the demands of the marketplace. What complicates their dynamic is that Stonehill isnt a humanisthes an assholewhile Crowley ends up arguing on behalf of economic forces that are not always in his childrens interest. Like Will Smiths The Pursuit of Happyness Vaughan and Jacobs strike a balance between Horatio Alger hustle and dread. No matter how conventionally inspiring the story when a corporatist patriarch can barely protect his spawn theres a fissure in the capitalism-nature continuum. Anyway I cried. A lot. What can I say? Im a sucker for kids on ventilators. When Crowley tells his daughter (Meredith Droeger) in the ICU that hell find a special medicine to save her she makes him promise it will be pinkdark pink not light pink which is babyish. That killed me. Yet for all the obvious tear-duct-squeezing Vaughan handles the child actors with restraint. Fraser doesnt suggest the drive of the real Crowley who looks like a cross between Tom Cruise and Steve Carell but hes such a haggard lump of vulnerability that my heart went out to him. Extraordinary Measures has a soppy piano-and-strings score but the primal fear of loss sharpens every scene. Harrison Fords company bought the rights to Anands book and the role of Stonehill has been made to fit his mature temperament. Which is to say he barks a lot and never cracks a smile. Something bilious in Ford seems to have taken over and worn him down to sinews and sourness. Hes not especially convincing as an eccentric obsessive scientist who blasts rock and roll while scrawling equationshis rock-hard pecs suggest he spends more time pumping iron than poring over enzymes. But hes the star who made Extraordinary Measures happen. If the film does well and Pompe disease gets more attention and funding wellthats the showbiz side of capitalism which strives for a balance between box-office and beneficence. Steve Buscemi cuts so droll and heart-wrenching a figure in Hue Rhodess deadpan road movie Saint John of Las Vegas that the plotshaggy and inconsequential as it isgets in the way. Buscemi plays the title role a compulsive gambler who flees Vegas after a hair-raising unlucky streak and takes a desk job at an Albuquerque auto-insurance firm. He has the look of a man whos escaped from cannibals in midhead shrink gray skin pulled tight cadaverous hollows eyes bulging in fear. High-strung as he is though Buscemi wont be cast as the next Barney Fife. His voice is dry world-weary and his air of haunted fatalism gives him stature. Its too bad Sarah Silverman plays the dotty officemate who falls for him. I love her stand-up but her acting is all hipster campand she and Buscemi dont mesh. When John and a fraud investigator (Romany Malco) head back to Vegas to investigate a strippers injury claim the film turns into one of those indie parades of eccentrics that are hit-and-miss but mostly miss. One bit though is genius. John interviews a tow-truck driver (John Cho) who moonlights as a carnival human torchonly his torch suit has malfunctioned and the poor man has to sit behind his tent and wait for his fuel tank to empty. Every twenty seconds in mid-conversation he bursts into flames and the interview stops until they die down. Its so poetically apt. Their situations are different but John and Torch share a stoic dignity. They hold on to hope even in a world that delivers regular scorchings. 1 2 Next Share this story...

(Merie Wesimiller Wallace - AP/CBS Films) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday January 22 2010 At one point in ""Creation"" starring Paul Bettany as the naturalist and author Charles Darwin a colleague of Darwins delightedly observes that his friends groundbreaking research in natural selection has made God ""utterly redundant"" -- akin he adds to ""the appendix and the male nipple."" The delighted secularist crows ""Youve killed God sir"" This StoryMovies Melodrama mars the natural order of Creations world-shaking storyWatch Creation trailerWatch Extraordinary Measures trailer And thus does the Hundred Years Culture War begin in ""Creation"" an ambitious but uneven portrait of Darwin as he agonizes over whether to publish the revolutionary ""On the Origin of Species."" Directed by Jon Amiel ""Creation"" is a movie crammed with mini-plots and motivations with Darwin being routinely visited by the ghost of his beloved daughter Annie (Martha West) who by 1858 when he was on the cusp of writing his book had been dead seven years. The film also flips back and forth in time and setting while Darwin regales her with far-flung stories of his travels. For all its detail and reach ""Creation"" ultimately drowns in its own melodrama. But for those who crave a good cry or who are willing to slog through the highly pitched emotion there are things to value in ""Creation."" Chief among them is Bettanys sensitive convincing portrayal of Darwin not as the august bearded figure most of us know but as a vibrant husband and father driven to the psychological and physical brink by his pained -- and as it turned out prescient -- awareness of the cataclysmic implications of his work which still reverberate today. In ""Creation"" Darwin has long returned from his research trips on the HMS Beagle keeping his notes in a box tucked away in his study. Having teased out the principles of natural selection -- that species survive and evolve according to natural laws rather than an unseen Godly hand -- he nonetheless has sat on them for 20 years in part because he knew they would challenge and perhaps even upend Biblical and creationist beliefs. In the film Darwin is quietly challenged by his devout wife Emma (Jennifer Connelly) whose disapproval is most often expressed through her fiery performances on the family piano. The scientists faith has already been shaken by Annies death and his own findings and hes estranged from his best friend the Rev. Innes (Jeremy Northam). Nevertheless hes reluctant not just to break his wifes heart but to be accused of suggesting that such Judeo-Christian values as love faith trust and honor should be trumped by the coarse ""struggle for brute survival."" We know how this story ends ""On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection"" was published in 1859. But Amiel and Bettany still manage to inject a genuine note of suspense in whether Darwin will overcome his reservations. And in a very subtle way ""Creation"" winds up presenting the man himself as embodying the complexity of his own principles. Its competition -- with naturalist Alfred Russell Wallace who was nipping at Darwins heels with his own version of evolutionary theory -- that spurs Darwin finally to set pen to paper. But its also cooperation -- the emotional and intellectual support of family friends and his colleagues in the scientific community -- that gives him the guts to do it. The final image of Darwin is that of a man who most likely wouldnt be surprised that 150 years later educated people argue about creationism intelligent design or whether dinosaurs roamed the Earth with humans 6000 years ago. But one does get the sense that he might quibble with the argument between God and science as an either/or proposition. By the time Darwin puts his manuscript on a carriage bound for London he has emerged as someone who inhabits perhaps uncomfortably a world animated by both impassive physical forces and deep mystical meaning. At its best and thanks to a fine performance by Bettany ""Creation"" brings to life that well-trod observation that the mark of a sophisticated mind is the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts at the same time.    A similarly sympathetic protagonist grapples with illness death and his own contradictions in ""Extraordinary Measures."" Brendan Fraser plays John Crowley whose young son and daughter have a rare genetic disorder called Pompe disease. As the film begins Crowleys daughter Megan is celebrating her eighth birthday; its made clear in a few opening scenes that shes not expected to live past her ninth. Although inspired by Crowleys true -- and truly amazing -- story of perseverance and courage ""Extraordinary Measures"" takes its share of fictionalizing liberties including with kids ages chronology and locations. A crusty scientist played with get-off-my-lawn gruffness by Harrison Ford is a composite of the many doctors who helped Crowley on his search for a cure for the disease. But by Crowleys own account ""Extraordinary Measures"" gets his familys story right. (The movie is based on Wall Street Journal reporter Geeta Anands book ""The Cure How a Father Raised 100 Million--and Bucked the Medical Establishment -- in a Quest to Save His Children."") And its impossible not to be touched and inspired by the film in which Crowley quits his job and takes a flying leap into the unknown helping to finance research into finding a life-sustaining enzyme and finally entering his own children into the drugs trials. As a portrait of passion ingenuity and entrepreneurial drive ""Extraordinary Measures"" becomes less a ""disease of the week"" medical melodrama than a capitalist procedural on the order of Horatio Alger. Less ""My Sisters Keeper"" more ""The Pursuit of Happyness.""

Still despite bona fide big-screen stars Brendan Fraser and Harrison Ford its basically a tearjerking TV disease-of-the-week flick on the big screen. In this feature inspired by real events Fraser plays John Crowley an Oregon marketing executive whose 8-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son are dying of Pompe disease a rare form of muscular dystrophy that claims almost all of its victims before the age of 9. John decides to quit his job and seek a cure by forming a biotech company with Dr. Robert Stonehill (Ford) a brilliant but extremely crotchety academic researcher who lacks funding to develop the enzyme infusion therapy on which he is working. When the investors threaten to pull the plug after a few months John sells the company to a much larger corporation at a huge profit -- much to the horror of Robert who fears losing the independence by answering to a profitdriven entity. Most films today would tend to be on Roberts side. But ""Extraordinary Measures"" unusually slants to John -- in Frasers most impressive performance to date -- going out of his way to show his new corporate masters how they can make money from the research. The film has John -- seen enjoying a vast new home on Puget Sound -- explaining that victims of the disease would need very expensive treatments for the rest of their (extended) lives. It doesnt mention though that the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 provides generous financial incentives to firms that develop drugs that help very small numbers of people such as those afflicted with Pompe. In real life John Crowleys two children still living were much younger than they are in the film. And Fords character -- slightly overplayed and treated as an eccentric prone to alienating his colleagues -- is a composite of several scientists. Keri Russell underplays an underwritten role as Frasers long-suffering spouse. As the film builds to a credulity-testing climax there is less schmaltz than you might expect from the screenwriter of ""Chocolat"" -- though the filmmakers seldom hesitate to milk the Crowley kids and other Pompe-afflicted children for tears. Director Tom Vaughan (""What Happens in Vegas"") directs in basic TV style with loads of expository dialogue and monotonous camerawork that adds nothing to the story. ""Extraordinary Measures"" is basically ""Lorenzos Oil"" without the earlier films visual flair. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Tooth Fairy doesnt fly but it bites Read Next Tooth Fairy doesnt fly but it bites Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 37904 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 19630 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 16219 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Extraordinary Measures Life and death | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesExtraordinary Measures Life and deathThe wise moviegoer will want to resist Googling the book on which the medical drama Extraordinary Measures is based.Brendan Fraser usually associated with lighter fare plays a father fighting Big Pharma to save the life of his child in timely drama based on a real familys story.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Jan. 22 2010Starring Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser. Directed by Tom Vaughan. 108 minutes. At major theatres. PG The wise moviegoer will want to resist Googling the book on which the medical drama Extraordinary Measures is based.The full title of Geeta Anands tome serves as a complete one-line summary and spoiler of the movie not a good thing when youre dealing with an erstwhile thriller that is already short on suspense.A title card advises us that the film efficiently directed by Tom Vaughan (Starter For Ten) is ""inspired by true events."" Thats Hollywood code for the many liberties that have been taken with the facts. Article Continued BelowFor example Harrison Fords irascible scientist character Dr. Robert Stonehill is based on several irascible scientists. And the real family seeking a medical miracle headed by determined businessman John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) lives in New Jersey rather than the picturesque Oregon seen in the film.But these are hardly deal-breakers for a movie that actually works better as an instructional video on the perils of the American medical system than it does as straight melodrama. Few films on this topic so clearly illustrate the competing agendas and cut-throat capitalism of Americas for-profit health care.Crowley is a rising corporate star with a flair for salesmanship. Hes happily married to Aileen (Keri Russell). The couple have three children the two youngest of which have pompe disease a rare and aggressive form of muscular dystrophy. Expensive 24-hour private medical care has so far managed to save Megan (Meredith Droeger) and Patrick (Diego Velazquez) but time is fast running out for Megan age 8. Few pompe sufferers live past age 9.Crowley does research on the Internet and learns that Nebraska research scientist Dr. Stonehill has made a breakthrough with enzyme treatments that might prolong the lives of pompe sufferers. The catch is that the research is still at the theory stage and many hundreds of thousands of dollars are needed for further tests and critical trials to develop a drug.Ever the optimist Crowley is convinced that he can team with Stonehill to bring the drug to fruition. He will provide the business savvy and Stonehill will bring the science.But he didnt reckon on Stonehills many eccentricities. The doc wears blue jeans drives a pick-up truck loves to fish and listens to the Grateful Dead at top volume. Some kind of weirdo eh?More significantly Stonehill is a loner. He distrusts his fellow scientists loathes drug companies and hes never actually met a pompe sufferer. He doesnt particularly like Crowley (the feeling is mutual). But Stonehill is going to have to work with them all if a miracle is to be realized. Pompe is what bureaucrats unfeelingly refer to as an ""orphan disease"" one that kills too few people to be worth curing or even treating. Crowley rallies the families of other pompe sufferers to prove that theres potential profit in serving their needs.The real personalities of Fraser and Ford drive the picture. Fraser normally a comic actor and genial guy has packed on a few pounds and also added dramatic heft since his George of the Jungle hijinks. Hes completely believable as a middle-aged dad and corporate striver whose entire focus in life is saving his children. Ford needs no introduction in his depiction of Stonehill as a gruff iconoclast who takes no prisoners. Weve seen this side of Ford many times before which isnt that far removed from the real Harrison Ford. But he adds executive producer to his credits for Extraordinary Measures which suggests a degree of commitment that hasnt always been in evidence in his films of the past decade or so. Fraser and Ford clash well together and also with Dr. Kent Webber (Mad Mens Jared Harris) the drug company droid who is interested only in making a profit not in saving lives. ""These decisions have to be made objectively rationally"" he insists as Crowley and Stonehill press him to greenlight the process that could hasten the development of a pompe treatment.Yet Webber is no moustache-twirling movie villain. You can understand his point just as you can understand and sympathize with the desires and frustrations of Crowley and Stonehill. And neither Crowley nor Stonehill are exactly saints themselves.And heres where Extraordinary Measures is something more than just ordinary. It accurately mirrors the dysfunctionality of the U.S. health care system where charity is blunted and no miracles can happen unless they come with bags of cash.No less an authority than U.S. President Barack Obama agrees with this dim assessment which makes this movie right in tune with his current hard efforts to extend medicare benefits to millions of Americans.If there were more films like Extraordinary Measures there might be more support for what Obama and others are trying to achieve. This may not be a great picture but it has the potential to be an important one.andThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Ten minutes or so into Andrea Arnolds ""Fish Tank"" we dont yet know what the young English heroine is up to or even her name--this remarkable film dispenses plot information like a slow-release tablet dispenses active ingredients--but we already know lots about her. Shes seething with anger likes to dance has too much time on her hands is fearless or foolish or both and gives away her loneliness by taking in the gritty world around her with a yearning devouring gaze. Watch a scene from ""Fish Tank."" The film directed by British filmmaker Andrea Arnold follows an alienated 15-year old girl as she forms a relationship with her mothers boyfriend. Video courtesy of IFC. In fact her name is Mia shes 15 years old and shes played phenomenally well--indeed almost unaccountably well--by Katie Jarvis whod never acted before or for that matter done any dancing. (She was discovered at a train station in Essex arguing with her boyfriend.) ""Fish Tank"" is a coming-of-age story for Mia who will at least have a shot at happiness and a coming-into-mastery story for the writer-director Ms. Arnold whose prospects seem limitless. For those familiar with British film history gritty may instantly equate with working class and realistic. In this case it does and it doesnt. Does because Mias surroundings fill the bill--a cheerless housing project that she her prickly mother and kid sister call home; a landscape mostly though not entirely distinguished by blank horizons and vestiges of vanished industries. Doesnt because Ms. Arnold relieves the grittiness with interludes of intense pleasure (during one of them Mia watches her mothers handsome boyfriend catch a fish with his bare hands) and transcends realist conventions with tough-minded poetry. (The spirit of Fellini seems to hover over an exquisite ritualized dance toward the end.) Speakeasy Read a Qamp;A with ""Fish Tank"" star Michael Fassbender. Be forewarned that the accents are occasionally thick enough to make you wish for subtitles but rest assured that youll never have any doubt about whats going on. The intensity of Mias gaze goes off the charts when her mothers boyfriend Connor first shows up in their tacky flat. Hes played by Michael Fassbender who sustains an impressive star presence while staying within the bounds of Connors amiable seemingly gentle character. Here again the film is in no hurry to reveal his character in full so the question that sustains the dramatic tension is whether Connor will stay within the bounds of propriety as he becomes an increasingly intimate part of a family with an alluring Lolita in its midst. Whats immediately clear is that he has the heat to thaw Mias chilly demeanor though her innate hostility reasserts itself whenever she feels threatened by the loss of his attention. As heroines go Mia is a hard case and Ms. Arnold declines to make her a softer one. We come to like her only by fits and starts come to see her vulnerability very slowly. The one time the story flirts with sentimentality is when Mia is smitten by the spectacle of a white horse chained to a cement block in a junk-strewn lot. Even then her concern is so obsessive that she takes scary chances to set the poor nag free. ENLARGE Katie Jarvis who had no previous acting experience plays Mia in Fish Tank. IFC Films Despite her hooded personality shes capable of stunning surprises. Its been a good while since Ive seen a movie whose most powerful sequence was both unforeseen and entirely unpredictable as it played out. Or for that matter a movie whose climax ran so counter to carefully nourished expectations. Id already imagined the outcome by the time Mia went off to confront her fate but the filmmaker had a much better idea. (She also had a fine cast that includes Kierston Wareing as Mias mother and strong support from the cinematographer Robbie Ryan who has a great eye for industrial landscapes the production designer Helen Scott and the editor Nicolas Chaudeurge.) My first encounter with Ms. Arnold and her work was more than five years ago at the Telluride Film Festival where she showed ""Wasp"" a harrowing 26-minute featurette about a young woman strung out between kids she can barely care for and affection she cant find. Everyone who saw it at Telluride knew the director would go on to bigger things though perhaps not as quickly as she did; ""Wasp"" won an Oscar as the best live action short of 2004. Her first feature ""Red Road"" was a 2006 thriller set in Glasgow; it was conceived as part of an experimental project inspired by the Danish filmmaker Lars von Trier. No such artistic debts were involved in the making of ""Fish Tank."" Its her creation from the very first commanding shot--Mia facing the camera--and its a fine one. (The film has already opened in New York. Next Friday it will open in Los Angeles then play theaters in other major cities. In addition it will be available starting January 27th via video on demand. You can find out if its being carried by your cable provider by checking the IFC Films Web site at ifcfilms.com.) Watch a scene from ""Extraordinary Measures"" starring Harrison Ford as a scientist who teams up with a young father (Brendan Fraser) to save the lives of his sick children. Video courtesy of CBS Films. Extraordinary Measures ""Extraordinary Measures"" requires extraordinary tolerance for bathos bombast and plain old unpleasantness. Its a fictionalized--and sadly trivialized--adaptation of a nonfiction book ""The Cure"" which was written by my Wall Street Journal colleague Geeta Anand. The essence of the story was indicated by the books subtitle ""How a Father Raised 100 million--And Bucked the Medical Establishment--In a Quest to Save His Children."" The father John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) seeks out a brilliant but eccentric research biologist--in the movie hes called Dr. Robert Stonehill and played by Harrison Ford--to help find a cure for his young daughter and one of his sons both of whom are afflicted by a rare and inevitably fatal disorder called Pompe disease. (Another son is free of the genetic defect.) Eventually the two men join forces and produce an effective drug but not before being frustrated at every turn by the forces of Big Pharma and the demands of medical protocols. Speakeasy Read a Qamp;A with ""Extraordinary Measures"" star Brendan Fraser. If there was ever a way to dramatize the complexities of the real-life events the filmmakers didnt find it. Robert Nelson Jacobss script wallows in sentiment wanders from cliches to contrived crises (a power failure a couple of car chases) to exceedingly nasty confrontations. The casts principal poison pill is Mr. Ford--if yelling were acting hed walk away with an Oscar--but Jared Harris is no slouch in the department of arch nastiness; he plays a doctor and pharmaceutical executive who becomes Stonehills nemesis. Mr. Fraser is often stuck with looking bereft while the usually endearing Keri Russell gets pitifully little to do as Crowleys wife and the anguished mother of their gravely ill but still grating kids. The director was Tom Vaughan who like everyone else connected with this ponderous botch has done much much better in the past. Creation ""Creation"" is a fancier botch blissed out on its own cleverness. Paul Bettany is Charles Darwin struggling to finish ""The Origin of the Species"" while he grieves the loss of his beloved daughter Annie who died at the age of ten. Darwin was of course a seminal thinker with a far-ranging mind but the movie takes the measure of his mind during an anguished period of his life by constructing a surreal collage that suggests a severe case of attention deficit disorder. Its impossible to say whos more unhinged Darwin caught between faith and reason or the filmmakers flashing back to visions of Annie when they arent flinging around images of growth and decay that include barnacles birds an orangutan named Jenny swarms of fish a chick falling from its nest and flowers doing time-lapse death scenes. (Jon Amiel directed from John Collees adaptation of ""Annies Box"" a portrait of the naturalist by Darwins great great grandson Randal Keynes.) ""Youve killed God sir"" Toby Joness Thomas Huxley tells Darwin. A similar sentiment is expressed by Darwins pious wife whos played with grim intensity by Jennifer Connelly ""You are at war with God Charles and we both know that is a battle you cannot win."" Mr. Bettany is a fine and resourceful actor but ""Creation"" is a battle he was doomed to lose.  Paul Bettany plays the Archangel Michael in ""Legion"" another movie opening Friday but Sony declined to screen it for review. To judge from the fevered trailer the studio made the right call. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Look Back in Anger (1959) During the course of three years the late Tony Richardson directed three peerless examples of British working-class realism. In Richardsons debut feature adapted by Nigel Kneale from the electrifying and trailblazing play by John Osborne Richard Burton is Jimmy Porter Britains original Angry Young Man. A candy stall proprietor who plays jazz trumpet at night Jimmy rages against the night the day his stupefied wife (played by Mary Ure) and most of all the nation of his birth. The cast includes Claire Bloom as his mistress Edith Evans George Devine and Donald Pleasence. The cinematographer was Oswald Morris. ENLARGE The Entertainer (1960) In a second film based on a John Osborne play Laurence Olivier gave one of the most astonishing terrifying performances of his career as Archie Rice a rageful broken-down vaudevillian in broken-down England. He calls himself ""old Archie dead behind the eyes"" and so he may be but his soul still emits startling cries of scorn expressions of lechery and lamentations of self-loathing. Brenda de Banzie is Archies wife. Roger Livesey is his father Billy Rice a vaudeville headliner now retired. Joan Plowright is Archies daughter. With Shirley Anne Field Alan Bates Daniel Massey and Albert Finney. A Taste of Honey (1961) Joyous children run through the streets and scenes of Tony Richardsons third triumph an otherwise somber but tender drama based on a Shelagh Delaney play. (Before writing it Ms. Delaney had worked in the theater as an usherette.) Rita Tushingham plays Jo a shy girl living with her alcoholic mother. Murray Melvin is Geoffrey a gentle homosexual who befriends her and offers to marry her when Jo discovers that shes pregnant by a black sailor. The happiness that Jo and Geoffrey find is short-lived but the film remains a classic of what came to be known as the British New Wave.

"Extraordinary Measures | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; extraordinary-measures ) Extraordinary Measures (United States 2010) January 21 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli The question If it looks sounds feels and tastes like a Hallmark made-for-TV movie why has Extraordinary Measures received a theatrical release? The answer Harrison Ford. Ford doesnt do TV or at least he hasnt since appearing in an episode of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles some 17 years ago. The movie is a generally insipid feel-good production thats high on sentiment and manipulation but low on genuine drama and good acting. It opens with a caption informing us that it is ""inspired"" by true events. Translation Some of the stuff in the movie kinda sorta transpired in real life but most of it is Hollywood fiction. Those who want to jump to the films defense on the ground that the events contained herein happened would do well to research the historical record before making such a claim. My mantra however remains Never let the facts get in the way of a good story. The problem is this isnt a good story. The film begins by introducing us to John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) and his wife Aileen (Kerri Russell). They are the parents of three children; the youngest two are afflicted with Pompe disease a rare genetic disorder that will eventually kill them. When his daughter nearly dies John is galvanized to take action quitting his lucrative job and going into business with researcher Dr. Robert Stonehill (Harrison Ford) who believes he is close to finding a cure - if only he can obtain the funding to proceed with his research. Getting the venture capital proves more difficult than either the good-hearted John or the curmudgeonly Robert expects and both are forced to make compromises. Meanwhile Johns children are growing weaker and a doctors prognosis gives them less than a year to live. The material is as generic as one might expect. The emotional appeal is artificial; its hard to feel much for any of these one-dimensional characters. The most intriguing aspects of Extraordinary Measures relate to the behind-the-scenes politicking that goes on to keep the drug development on track although the screenplay cheats toward the end (presumably because of time constraints and a concern that too much detail might bore audiences). The interpersonal material is lifeless. I was reminded on more than one occasion of Robin Williams Patch Adams. Thats not generally considered to be a good association. If there was a reason to see Extraordinary Measures it would be for the cast but the acting is uniformly disappointing. Harrison Ford once the swashbuckling Indiana Jones grumbles his way through the part. ClichA(c)s dont get any more obvious than the brilliant misanthrope who develops a conscience and Ford does nothing to breathe life into his character. Meanwhile Brendan Fraser once a swashbuckling Indiana Jones knockoff illustrates why he isnt given more of these serious dramatic roles. They are not his forte as his work in Extraordinary Measures demonstrates. His worst scene is probably the one in which he breaks down in his office after learning his children will not be part of the drugs clinical trial. The scene is so embarrassing its almost funny. Finally Kerri Russell meekly accepts the underdeveloped and underexposed part of the loving supportive wife and mother. One wonders what she saw in Aileen when the script was presented to her for consideration. The director Tom Vaughan has the kind of unimpressive resume that results in a lackluster assignment like this and this is a step down from his previous outing What Happens in Vegas. His unimaginative style lends itself to a project like this. The involvement of CBS Films (bankrolling their debut effort) serves to accentuate the impression that this movie was developed primarily for a television audience. Theres nothing remotely theatrical about it and its hard to imagine why anyone would want to spend hard-earned money on a movie that might have trouble holding a viewers attention on television where the availability of the remote control makes it unlikely that Extraordinary Measures would be watched from beginning to end.

"Extraordinary Measures reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Extraordinary Measures reviewed. Extraordinary Measures reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 21 2010 831 PM If I Dont Write a Good Business Plan My Child Will Die I sort of liked Extraordinary Measures. By Dana Stevens Brendan Fraser as John Crowley in Extraordinary Measures Heres the most extraordinary thing about Extraordinary Measures (CBS Films) I sort of liked it. Yes the movie about Harrison Ford and Brendan Fraser working together around the clock to discover a cure for Frasers childrens rare genetic disease. The movie with this poster. And this tag line ""Dont hope for a miracle. Make one."" Though the believe-in-your-dreams story line comes straight from the Lifetime Channel stockpile it gains emotional resonance from the fact that (in slightly less dramatic form) it really happened--the movie is based on a nonfiction book by Geeta Anand--and from the believably prickly relationship between the two charismatic leads. Fraser and Ford are both actors of limited range who can be extremely appealing in the right role and here theyre both ideally cast Fraser as the naive doting boundlessly optimistic suburban dad and Ford as the snarling misanthropic classic-rock-blasting scientist. Even given the foregone conclusion can you honestly say you dont want to see these guys found a biotech startup together and save the sick kids against all odds? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. OK maybe you can. But its a little harder to resist the pulpy pull of this kind of movie once one has a kid of ones own. Extraordinary Measures works if it works at all as a parental wish-fulfillment fantasy It allows the viewer to imagine his or her own child placed in extreme peril thereby translating the everyday exertions of parenting into a swashbuckling escapade. Last years Taken in which Liam Neeson played a retired CIA super-spy forced back into action when his daughter was kidnapped by sex traders was an example of parental wish-fulfillment in the action-adventure genre. But Taken was an acceptable popcorn pleasure--and generally well-received by critics--because it was a macho action-adventure story. Advertisement As John Crowley the corporate employee turned pharmaceutical entrepreneur Brendan Fraser doesnt have to rely on his black-ops training or pull any karate moves. He just has to write a bunch of really kick-ass business plans. Given that most of us lead lives that depend far more on impressing people in meetings than on the ability to throat-punch Serbian thugs the scenes in which Crowley wows roomfuls of venture capitalists with his binder full of graphs are not without their low-key satisfactions. Crowley a successful Portland businessman as the movie begins has two children in the advanced stages of Pompe disease a rare genetic disorder that causes irreversible muscle degeneration and kills most victims by the age of 9. As the movie begins his oldest Megan (Meredith Droeger) has just turned 8 and John and his wife Aileen (Keri Russell) know her days are numbered. After a medical crisis in which the Crowleys nearly lose their daughter John seeks out Dr. Robert Stonehill (Ford) an academic research scientist known for his groundbreaking but untested ideas for a Pompe cure. Stonehill is unforthcoming to the point of surliness but when Crowley proposes to raise 500000 to help him develop a drug for field trials he starts listening. This middle section of the movie goes to some unexpected places as Crowley Stonehill and their corporate investors butt heads over how best to fundraise finance and market their prospective miracle drug. It would have been easy to make this a David-vs.-Goliath drama about the scrappy startup standing up to the faceless corporate giant. Instead the movie shows the process of bringing a new drug to market as a succession of hard-fought often troubling compromises between the aspirations of science and the realities of a market economy. In one meeting Crowley is asked to estimate what rate of ""acceptable loss""--i.e. mortality--would make his drug financially viable to develop. The father of two dying children winces for a moment then goes ahead and estimates a figure. In a lesser movie hed have thrown down his binder and stormed out of the meeting protesting that no loss was acceptable--then gotten the investment anyway. Though this movie never directly addresses the debate about health care reform it clearly sends the message that capitalism and medicine make uncomfortable bedfellows. The scenes involving political infighting in the biotech sector are more successful than the domestic ones though the screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs largely steers clear of bathos in its portrayal of the sick children. As a little girl wary of being condescended to by grown-ups Meredith Droeger is dryly funny and even Keri Russell in a standard-issue supportive wife role has her moments. (I liked it when assured by her husband that he would do whatever was necessary to keep their health insurance she muttered ""No shit."") The book Im currently reading Carl Wilsons remarkable Lets Talk About Love A Journey to the End of Taste makes the case that ""middlebrow is the new lowbrow"" that the most socially stigmatizing taste to admit to is no longer the appreciation of pulp but the enjoyment of pablum. The example Wilsons book is structured around is the music of Celine Dion but a movie like Extraordinary Measures fits the bill just as well. To admit you like Extraordinary Measures is to admit youre ordinary susceptible to happy endings moved by the notion of saving sick children amused by Harrison Ford in his late-period ""Get off my lawn"" mode. I plead guilty--but I feel no guilt at all. Slate V The critics on Extraordinary Measures and other new releases Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Pig- biting angry. Angrier than a one-man production of ""Twelve Angry Men."" He plays Dr. Robert Stonehill a medical researcher with a potential cure for a fatal genetic disorder and a compulsion to lock horns with anyone he considers his intellectual inferior which is everyone. Based on a real-life story ""Extraordinary Measures"" from the new studio CBS Films would fit snugly into the two-hour slot behind ""CSI NY."" It has the production values visual texture and maudlin tone of a disease-of-the-week teleplay. Fords participation and the grandstanding performance he delivers raise it from a middlebrow TV-style weepie to a higher plateau of quality. Intermittently anyway. The tear jerking starts early and proceeds until our lachrymal glands are milked squeezed sucked and bled dry. Brendan Fraser and Keri Russell play John and Aileen Crowley whose two youngest children have Pompe Disease a lethal muscle-waster. John is a star executive but his kids health crisis overshadows career concerns. Plucking responsive chords of work-vs.-family obligations the script presents John with a dilemma Should he stay in his job using its generous health insurance for palliative treatment or quit to start his own drug company with the brash quixotic Stonehill and aim for a miracle cure? It wouldnt be much of a drama if he played it safe would it? Fords character is a brash maverick genius contemptuous of fools and unsentimental about the victims of the disease hes determined to outwit. Think ""House"" on trucker pills. Of course when he meets the Crowleys brave little angels he exposes a well-concealed grumpy/affectionate side. A pickup-drivin rock n roll-blastin T-shirt-wearin cuss from corn country hes an unmanageable force transplanted into a by-the-book corporate culture. Nobody does disdain as well as Ford and his sneering glaring table-pounding turn brings the movie to life. Hes loud but he doesnt annoy you he cheers you up. When Fraser prods him on the slow pace of progress Ford roars ""I already work around the clock"" This is one of those lines like ""Go ahead make my day"" and ""You cant handle the truth"" that will go on to have an eternal life of its own. When the focus shifts to the doughy Fraser and steadfast Russell the stage is set for tedium. Fraser is a supporting player; in his scenes with Ford hes cowed. As the business half of the partnership hes tasked with running meetings where stock deals and FDA approval practices are debated. Its dull stuff. The legalistic focus of these scenes does allow one valuable insight however. To satisfy his investors Crowley has to offer a calm calculated financial rationale. It roughens up the movies moral texture when the idealist must confront the issue of acceptable patient fatalities -- a reminder that sometimes the greater good is served by cold-hearted discipline. EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG for thematic material language and a mild suggestive moment. Still the movie is gushy sentimentality at heart. It begs too hard for our feelings. In a funk of anxiety Crowley bends important FDA rules to get his kids first crack at the experimental drug. He organizes a tour for Pompe victims to the offices of his new slow-moving corporate partners to goose their consciences. He does everything but throw a bake sale in the boardroom. Whenever the mush piles up too high though Ford pops up infuriated and bellowing and we can only cower behind our seats giggling until the typhoon passes.

Dr. Stonehill (Harrison Ford right) and John Crowley (Brendan Fraser) team up to save the lives of Crowleys two children. Photo CBS FILMS Extraordinary Measures 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Excuse me but we need a moratorium. Could someone with clout in the film industry please call a halt to tinkly piano music? Its too late for Extraordinary Measures but maybe the next time an uplifting family movie gets made the director and producers can sit down with their pal the composer and politely demand a musical score without all the drippy keyboard piddles. Measures was ""inspired by true events"" and I cant imagine a story with less use for superfluous tear-jerking. Its about adorable dying children for Petes sake. It features noble parents (Brendan Fraser and Keri Russell) a crusading scientist (Harrison Ford) and a desperate race against the clock to find a workable treatment. There is no need given the plot and its basis in fact to crank up the mush factor with Andrea Guerras tintinnabulating score. The suffering kids are enough. Otherwise director Tom Vaughn (What Happens in Vegas) and screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs (working from Geeta Anands book The Cure) take a more-or-less foursquare approach to the material following Frasers worried dad as he tracks down Fords cantankerous biochemist and starts raising money for his research. The two of them make an interesting onscreen partnership Fraser soft and domesticated as John Crowley a Bristol-Myers exec with two sick kids; Ford crusty and alienating as the misanthropic Dr. Stonehill who might hold the key to saving their lives. The condition called Pompe disease is a progressive genetic disorder that leads to muscle weakness organ failure and death. We learn that 6-year-old Patrick (Diego Velazquez) and 8-year-old Megan (Meredith Droeger) might never hit 9. As the film unspools scientific terms start buzzing around like flies theres talk of enzymes glycogen lactating bovine udders. At times the script gets too dense with technicalities and boardroom arguments for layfolk to comprehend. But at its best it humanizes the plight of families who cope day-to-day with disabling illness showing us the plucky kids in motorized wheelchairs -- and the parents who grin through a childs birthday while fearing it could be her last. Man vs. Disease is the main conflict here. The movie also pits Ford vs. Fraser in fantastic bouts of righteous screaming -- growling spitting vein-popping -- as time runs out on Johns children. The histrionics are all quite actorly and convincing and I understand the logic behind them. Medical research might be dramatic as hell for those who do it but hunched nerds in lab coats dont offer much excitement for average movie goers. Better to toss in a few raw slabs of scenery-chewing to keep them awake. In premise Extraordinary Measures looks like a dead ringer for Lorenzos Oil George Millers 1992 movie about a couple seeking a cure for their sons rare disorder. But in that film the parents do all the cramming and investigating by themselves; in this one their hopes ride on the work of scientists and pharmaceutical bigwigs. So instead of rooting for Mom and Dad in their race against the clock were rooting for drug companies.

In fact its hard to believe that this schmaltzy film found its home on the big screen rather than the Hallmark Channel. But I dare you not to feel something at its conclusion. Just consider the material Fed up with doctors prescribing a death sentence for his two children -- who suffer from the rare and fatal Pompe disease -- a proactive businessman (Brendan Fraser) teams up with a temperamental scientist (Harrison Ford) to develop a life-saving drug. The duo hit plenty of roadblocks along the way (lack of funding power struggles etc.) and spend much of the film in conference rooms discussing enzymes -- unfortunately not the most moviegoer-friendly fare. The leading men deserve far better than the ho-hum material they?re given (try not to cringe as Ford delivers the oddly placed line ""Im gonna go take a crap""). But Fraser works so hard playing a devoted dad its damn hard not to root for him.

ABOUT THE MOVIEExtraordinary Measures  (out of four)Stars Harrison Ford Brendan Fraser Keri Russell Jared Harris David ClennonDirector Tom VaughanDistributor CBS FilmsRating PG for thematic material language and mild suggestive contentRunning time 1 hour 45 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Harrison Ford has obviously enrolled in the Al Pacino School of Old Man Acting. He yells sputters and glowers his way through the ultra-ordinary and well-intentioned Extraordinary Measures which feels like a barely gussied-up Lifetime movie. VIDEO Watch the trailer Ford plays Bob Stonehill a curmudgeonly doctor who spends most of his time alone in a research lab poring over treatment formulas for an obscure disease. We know hes unconventional with a capital U because he blares classic rock drives a big truck is twice divorced and takes off to go fishing in the middle of a conversation. Brendan Fraser plays John Crowley the business executive father of two young children diagnosed with Pompe diseasea rare genetic disorder. The expected life span of those afflicted with the disease is about 9 years. John and his wife Aileen (Keri Russell) are kind and loving parents doing what they can to help their children 8-year-old Megan (Meredith Droeger) and 6-year-old Patrick (Diego Velazquez). When Megan is hospitalized for a serious complication the Harvard Business School-educated John decides to use his business acumen to help his severely ill children. John already had tried to contact the grumpy Gus Dr. Stonehill having read about his research but the man inexplicably wouldnt return his calls. So he flies to Lincoln Neb. and makes him a proposition to raise funds for his research. Together they form a biotech company with the emphasis on bio since the two have little chemistry. While Fraser plays a loving father well -- and Russell is fine as his tenacious wife -- he and Ford dont seem like theyre in the same movie. Their few feeble attempts at humor fall flat. A big part of the movie involves contentious meetings with potential funders amid the political machinations of biotech firms. Yes thats about as exciting as it sounds. When they sell their small company to a larger firm a villainous doctor (Jared Harris) is hellbent on cutting John out of the equation. Boardroom fireworks fizzle. Scenes of busy scientists in a lab are equally tedious. When things cant get any more boring Ford pumps up the volume. ""No ones going to tell me how to run my lab"" he thunders menacingly. Really? Even if those no ones are funding your research? There might be a poignant movie based on the true story of a fathers devoted efforts to help his ailing children a la Lorenzos Oil. But this tediously told tale is not that movie. Director Tom Vaughn made a much more enjoyable and unfortunately too-little-seen British film called Starter for Ten starring James McAvoy and Rebecca Hall. Discerning audiences would be better served checking that out. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

Or should the Bristol Myers-Squibb executive work around the clock pushing scientists and venture capitalists to produce a drug that might prolong their lives?Such is the premise of Extraordinary Measures inspired by a gripping true-life story and brought to the screen by Tom Vaughan (Starter for 10) as a slack well-meaning disease-of-the-week drama of the sort one might encounter on the Hallmark Channel.Extraordinary Measures stars Brendan Fraser miscast as Crowley the caring father racing against time trading verbal punches with Harrison Ford who is a gas as Robert Stonehill the cranky scientist raging against pitiful government funding for research.Screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs (Chocolat) forces the material into the Odd Couple mold structuring it as equal parts business thriller and medical thriller with little to say about the crisis in American health care.The script characterizes Crowley a biotech executive as a people person and team player with serious salesman skills.Stonehill (a composite of many scientists) is presented as a solitary researcher who interprets the gentlest suggestion as a vicious attack on his autonomy.For this dynamic to work the actors need to be of complementary temperament and equal power. This is not the case.Fraser stiff and visibly uncomfortable as if wearing a suit two sizes too small is painful to watch. In the scenes where John dotes on his ailing children Fraser looks like a quivering mass of Jell-O. And as the biotech entrepreneur who moves mountains he looks as though he couldnt climb a hillock. When hes onscreen time stands still and not in a cinematic way.Ford mining the same vein that Clint Eastwood tapped in Gran Torino is sharp and cantankerous and gives this flaccid movie some muscle. Likewise excellent is Jared Harris best known as the English bean counter on Mad Men as a Big Pharmaceutical bean counter and a stunning turn by Courtney B. Vance as a father whose daughters have Pompe.With more sensitive casting the movie would have been more dramatically effective. Still better-matched leads could not address the unasked question at the center of the Extraordinary Measures script in which the prosperous Crowley gets even more so when he sells his biotech startup to another company.So Ill ask the question. While I desperately prayed for a treatment that would spare the lives of the Crowley children I couldnt help thinking In a nation where the health-care safety net has so many gaping holes are the only ones who get rescued the super-rich?Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Extraordinary Measures review Ford and Fraser play to type in film based on Jersey family |       NJ.com comments Extraordinary Measures review Ford and Fraser play to type in film based on Jersey family Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 21 2010 at 500 PM updated January 21 2010 at 503 PM View/Post Comments CBS FILMSBrendan Fraser right plays a desperate father who teams up with an eccentric medical researcher (Harrison Ford) to find a cure for a rare genetic disorder that afflicts two of his children. Extraordinary Measures (PG) CBS Films (105 min.) Directed by Tom Vaughan. With Harrison Ford Brendan Fraser Keri Russell. Now playing in New Jersey.TWO STARS Watching the old CBS ""eye"" logo pop up at the start of ""Extraordinary Measures"" you might worry you just shelled out 10 to see a made-for-TV movie. You wouldnt be completely wrong. Not that this new film has already been on television (its a theatrical release from the networks movie division). Or that some small-screen movies particularly those made for premium cable arent excellent. But ""Extraordinary Measures"" feels like one of those old disease-of-the-week flicks from a couple of decades ago -- predictable programmed feel-bad/feel-good melodramas forgotten as soon as you tossed away the last Kleenex. The good intentions are there. Whats missing is any artistic surprise or dramatic risk-taking. Based on the real-life story of John and Aileen Crowley of Princeton (but with the setting changed to Portland years compressed to months and some major fictional characters added) the movie details how the Crowleys refused to accept that two of their children were doomed to die from a rare metabolic disorder called Pompe disease. But instead of slipping into simple denial the Crowleys turned their stubbornness into action -- the father quit his job to begin a biotech start-up dedicated solely to finding a cure or at least a treatment for his children and others like them. It gives nothing away to say that Crowley was ultimately successful -- who on Earth would want to see a movie about a desperate father who failed? But the finale isnt the only thing that feels predetermined in this dull dramatization from screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs. The Crowleys home life is built more on pretty pictures than complicated facts. (Just how was he able to walk away from his job -- and health care coverage -- when medical bills were running 40000 a month?) People are reduced to mere tics (all we really know about one major character is that hes grumpy and likes 70s rock). That character is played by Harrison Ford one of the films producers and he does grouchy macho better than anyone. (Hell he was short-tempered as Han Solo and thirty-odd years havent mellowed him one bit.) Brendan Fraser who always radiates genuine sweetness is a staunch John Crowley while pretty Keri Russell mostly looks concerned as Aileen. Theyre all well cast but in a way thats part of the problem. Theyre too well cast all playing to their standard polished personas. We know as soon as we see Fraser running out of his office that hes going to be loving (but determined) the moment we spy Ford in his lab that hes going to be short-tempered (but decent). But wouldnt the film have been stronger if we werent so sure? If it hadnt been cast according to type and the actors chosen didnt telegraph ""hero"" quite so early? Admitted much of this was decided before director Tom Vaughan (who last made the execrable ""What Happens in Vegas"") came on board but he doesnt seem too interested in mixing things up. The film proceeds slowly safely and rather boringly -- right down to the overdone score by Andrea Guerra which oozes over every scene like syrup. Yes the actors are pleasant enough and the film gets some of the tears its looking for -- who isnt going to feel a twinge seeing worried parents and sick kids on screen? The Pacific Northwest locations are pretty (although why did the familys Jersey base have to be rewritten?) and Jared Harris adds a little spark as what passes for the villain of the piece. Fans of the various actors may enjoy seeing them do again what these various actors usually do. Parents with their own sick children may find some catharsis; parents with healthy kids may realize momentarily just how lucky they are. But no one will miss too much if they wait for this film to show up on DVD. Or on TV. Ratings note The film contains some strong language.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + In ""Extraordinary Measures the camera spends a lot of time staring at the lines and circles on Brendan Frasers face. He plays a pharmaceutical marketing executive who pushes to find a drug that will treat a deadly strain of muscular dystrophy that afflicts two of his children. The focus on Frasers puddling eyes or his face wrenching before a crying jag - on his emotional state - feels like something new for the sick-kid movie Dads hurt too.This is a genre that tends to exploit the fight against disease in order to exalt mothers. Here all the haggard-parent reaction shots go to Fraser. Although by the time he attempts to weep while sliding down a closed door you wish someone had told him to leave that to the experts at Lifetime.Loosely based on true events that happened a decade ago in Cambridge ""Extraordinary Measures is entertaining enough. Its the first horse out of the gate from CBSs new theatrical division and without a trace of shame it plays like one of the networks movies of the week despite the off-the-rack medical-thriller title. But the screenplay by Robert Nelson Jacobs affirms life and jerks tears with welcome degrees of humor and muscle.""Extraordinary Measures is basically a love story between two men. Frasers executive John Crowley secures funding that helps Dr. Robert Stonehill a crusty scientific genius played by Harrison Ford develop the drug. Stonehill is a maverick whos been working on a treatment for years but lacked the budget to realize his breakthrough.When Crowley tells Stonehill that he had to cut a deal for the first round of funding they start growling at each other. Its the sort of screaming match that were Fraser a woman would have ended with the two in each others arms. Instead the doctor helps the executive rinse a cut. Its adorable. Cuter is the way Stonehill calls Crowley ""Jersey after Crowleys home state. Its just like Ford would do for Karen Allen or Michelle Pfeiffer.For the record Crowley has a wife (Keri Russell). She appears only half as saintly as her husband and Russells chemistry with Fraser is only half as good as his is with Ford. All the good writing is saved for scenes among the men - Jared Harris plays one of the uptight executives at the biotech company that winds up bringing Crowley and Stonehill into its fold.Were meant to be moved by the race to prolong the lives of the Crowley children one of whom is a ball of spunk played by Meredith Droeger. And its touching. But ""Extraordinary Measures which Tom Vaughn directed and is based on ""The Cure a nonfiction book by former Globe reporter Geeta Anand is much more interesting as a glimpse into the world of funding and developing drugs. The story has been moved from Cambridge to Seattle and Genzyme is now a company called Zymagen which sounds as if it was cooked up by a biotech name generator.The movie might like money more than science (both the house and the pharma in this movie are big). But it takes the science much more seriously than similar movies do. Listening to Ford say things like ""Weve got to get better cleavage between the alpha and beta subunits never gets old. Its nice to see him once again happily playing the unsentimental grouch. Ford - and Fraser - make this melodrama with all its suits and lab coats more watchable than it has any business being.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Note to TV networks If youre looking to break into theaters its probably unwise to start out with a programmatic by-the-book TV movie that implies your new theatrical-film imprint will be playing things safe and bland. (Or alternately that you cant see past the stereotyped version of your own bailiwick.) Unfortunately this advice comes too late for the new subsidiary CBS Films which is launching its theatrical endeavors with the disease-of-the-week drama Extraordinary Measures. Loosely inspired by Geeta Anands book The Cure it follows the story of real-life father John Crowley (played by Brendan Fraser) who quit his finance-sector job and founded a charity and a biotech firm in an attempt to cure a rare genetic disorder in time to save his dying children. The film closely follows the pattern of 1992s Lorenzos Oil but with fewer filmmaking risks visceral emotions and colorful outsized characters. The exception to that last comes in the form of Extraordinary Measures executive producer Harrison Ford co-starring as a crotchety eccentric University Of Nebraska researcher whose theories make Crowleys task possible but whose recalcitrance and flakiness put up constant barriers. His antics (including temper tantrums social obliviousness and egocentric mayhem) give the film most of its flavor but thats by design His character was wholly invented for the movie as a foil and drama-inciter. And no wonder. Without him it would barely be a movie. Most of the plots developments remain underplayed a series of heartwarming moments and plodding procedural beats often not addressed with enough detail to register. But even with Ford Extraordinary Measures reads like little more than a dramatized timeline. Its easy enough to get caught up in Crowleys race against the clock but the presentation leans heavily on emotional manipulation and a tear-wringing score. Fraser has little to do but look angsty and determined; Keri Russell as his wife is an afterthought. Ford is an entertainingly irascible scene-thief but knowing hes just there to spice things up throws seeds of doubt into every moment of the film undermining and distracting from Crowleys real-life struggles. Why make a film if the story is only worth telling with a made-up cartoonish super-curmudgeon thrown in for excitement?

Extraordinary Measures"" takes reasonable care to enliven the fact-based story of a fathers endless negotiations with the medical establishment on behalf of his terminally ill kids. Yet this first CBS Films release doesnt reach far beyond its smallscreen genotype as a disease-of-the-week telepic despite the star power of Brendan Fraser as the desperate dad and Harrison Ford as an eccentric ornery researcher. Pic has its pleasures chiefly Frasers charming turn as sleepless John Crowley whose work inspired the source material. But talky and didactic over too long a stretch ""Measures"" is unlikely to find a common cure at the B.O. Unimpeachably well-meaning in the manner of so many race-for-the-cure dramas the pic at least succeeds in shining a light on the horrors of Pompe disease a rare malady that causes severe muscular deterioration in every part of a childs body. With two of their three kids battling Pompe pharmaceuticals executive Crowley and his wife Aileen (Keri Russell) are urged by a doctor to view the evidently impending deaths of 6-year-old Patrick (Diego Velazquez) and 8-year-old Megan (Meredith Droeger) as a ""blessing"" given the painfulness of the disease. Upon hearing this patronizing advice Dad springs into action impulsively flying from his familys home in Princeton N.J. to Lincoln Neb. where Dr. Robert Stonehill (Ford who also exec produced) has been working to prove Pompes vincibility in theory if not sans funds in practice. A fancifully penned composite of real-life researchers Fords middle-aged Stonehill bears the brunt of the pics bid to inject some flair into fairly dry proceedings. Given to blasting classic tunes by the Band and the Dead while crunching equations and klutzily disconnecting calls the stubborn researcher -- unreachable except at the local bar where he sips Bud and watches the tube -- is fairly convincing except during the handful of times when he gets mad and yells the character pushing well past Fords low-key acting parameters. For a while as levelheaded Crowley and temperamental Stonehill collaborate on the Herculean task of bringing a life-saving enzyme to market the movie gets a mildly infectious kick out of showing that the younger man is vastly more mature than his reluctant partner. But the conceit grows tiresome as surly Stonehill reaches his umpteenth realization that Crowley -- whom he nicknames ""Jersey"" -- has been right to play beat-the-clock by establishment rules. Personifying big pharma a trio of fine actors -- Jared Harris Patrick Bauchau and David Clennon -- are called repeatedly to iterate the obvious point that investment returns matter at least as much to this industry as the health of children using respirators and wheelchairs. Maintaining the viewers sympathies throughout Fraser makes for a believably swollen-eyed workaholic crusader a devoted father whos forced to surrender precious time with his kids in the exhaustive effort to prolong their lives. Ford buff as ever cuts a striking figure in a lab coat. Director Tom Vaughan (""What Happens in Vegas"") relies too heavily on title cards to establish locations as the film shuttles clumsily among Portland Seattle Chicago and Lincoln. Lensing throughout is perfunctory. Befitting a movie that too often favors the minutiae of business dealings over raw emotion the real Crowley appears briefly in the role of ""Renzler Venture Capitalist No. 2.""

Extraordinary Measures Fair Director Tom Vaughan. Cast Brendan Fraser Harrison Ford Keri Russell. Rating PG for thematic material language and a mildly suggestive moment. RELATED Brendan Fraser Playing a life Real-life dad finds Measures extraordinary Spotlight Harrison Ford Thats one way of looking at ""Extraordinary Measures"" a film based on the true story of John Crowley a businessman who upended his life to try to find a cure for the rare fatal genetic disorder two of his children suffered from. Director Tom Vaughans film certainly means well. And it gets some things right even when it might have taken an easier route. Yet the overall feel is one of a generic feel-good drama albeit one with Harrison Ford stomping around most of the time as if someone kicked him in the shins. One suspects that this is a story that deserved better. Crowley (Brendan Fraser) is an Ivy League-educated businessman climbing the corporate ladder. He and his wife Aileen (Keri Russell) have three children two of whom suffer from Pompe disease. Both are confined to wheelchairs and require respirators. Megan (Meredith Droeger) is precocious and fearless; Patrick (Diego Velazquez) is much sicker. Both however are nearing the outer limits of their life expectancy. A scare with Megan prompts Crowley to take action. On a whim he flies to Nebraska to talk with Robert Stonehill (Ford) a crusty loner who also happens to be the leading researcher in finding a drug to help control Pompe. Sure Stonehill is confident he can help. He just needs money and a lot of it. Crowley assures him he can raise the cash. He cant not initially. But Crowley quits his lucrative job to create a company with Stonehill to produce the drug. At this point ""Extraordinary Measures"" shifts its focus from a family-based medical drama to a critique of the corporate establishment. Their start-up company runs into all manner of impediments most of them predictable not enough money not enough time not enough experience in trying to get a drug to market. Crowley and Stonehill work together using each others strengths to press on. But then their bond is tested. Will their work and their relationship survive? And is this also a buddy movie? Ill leave it to you to discover the answers but youve probably guessed them by now. Fraser is fine as Crowley a very smart man driven to do what at first seem like stupid things. But who can question the motives of a man risking everything for his children? Russell isnt really around much but when she is its mostly to support her husband or care for her kids. Droeger is appropriately adorable and spunky. Ford is so angry so much of the time that clips of his screaming ""I already work around the clock"" in ads for the film have become a viral Internet sensation. Hard to say exactly what he was going for here - cranky misunderstood genius is the best bet - but he might have included a little anger management in his preparation for the role. Yet one thing Vaughan gets exactly right is the Crowleys relationship with their children. Despite the severity of their illness theyre still kids. They are perfectly capable of misbehaving and of being punished for it. Parents with sick kids dont typically treat them with kid gloves. They live with their children and their childrens illness day and night. Its their reality and most treat it as such. Most films take a sappier approach. ""Extraordinary Measures"" does not. Had Vaughan applied the same focus to the rest of the film it would have been all the more effective and all the better as well. Read Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.
