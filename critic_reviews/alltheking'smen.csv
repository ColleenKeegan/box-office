In office he proves as good as his word though populism comes at a price underhand tactics to push through his reforms. But can good really come out of bad? An intriguing question you might think yet Steve Zaillians adaptation of the Pulitzer-winning Robert Penn Warren novel (inspired by real-life 30s Southern demagogue Huey P Long) shies away from it concentrating instead at undue length on the crisis of conscience and class betrayal faced by his patrician advisor (Jude Law underwhelming). This may be more faithful to the source unlike Robert Rossens punchy 1949 Oscar-winning version but it somehow misses the real story here leaving sidelined Penn gruesomely over-emphatic as he shouts and waves his arms to get some attention in what should be his movie. There are ambitions towards complexity though Laws overused voiceover and sundry fumbled plot points indicate the films struggle to compact its story into just over two hours. Stuttering and uninvolving the result plays out its would-be noble drama of lost ideals in a hermetically sealed universe where every part is played by name actors (Winslet Hopkins Ruffalo etc) spouting overworked dialogue while James Horners score thunders on in the key of self-importance. Even the chilling grey colour palate seems all wrong for a story set in the sweat-pit of Deep South graft. What should have been an incisive study of the American political scene turns out a lumbering celluloid white elephant.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 22 2006 426 PM Gone South A risible new All the Kings Men. By Dana Stevens Sean Penn in All the Kings Men From the first scene of All the Kings Men (Columbia Pictures) you know youre in for a slog Jude Law lies in bed staring at a slow-moving ceiling fan as we hear his Louisiana drawl on the soundtrack. Beware the literary adaptation--especially the Southern literary adaptation with ceiling fans--that begins with a voice-over. Once youve started down that road its hard not to end up with a film as ponderous and turgid as a book report. This version of Robert Penn Warrens Pulitzer Prize-winning novel written and directed by Steven Zaillian is crammed with big-name stars and generously slathered with a score by James (Titanic) Horner. But it feels so fussed over so concerned with mood and texture and setting that the story gets bogged down in a tangle of Spanish moss. Penn Warrens novel and the Oscar-winning 1949 film based on it never explicitly named the Southern state they took place in but this version--executive-produced by Louisianan James Carville--locates the action in Louisiana opening on a shot of the state seal on the floor of the Capitol building. The timing of this remake not to mention the participation of Carville had my mind racing to find parallels with current events. Was the subplot about dangerously shoddy public construction meant as a Katrina reference? Was Willie Stark supposed to remind us of Clinton (a charismatic skirt-chasing populist) or Bush (a petty tyrant sheltered from the truth by his team of handlers)? Maybe its pointless to ask in this age of remakes what it is about a particular work of art that demands or deserves revisiting Old movies and TV shows are remade simply because theyre there like great cultural rainforests waiting to be plundered. But this movie sets up its audience dangling just enough similarities with the present day to seem vaguely smart but never thinking through what those similarities might mean. Advertisement All the Kings Men tells the story of a journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) who becomes a fixer for a dark-horse gubernatorial candidate a self-taught hick named Willie Stark (Sean Penn). The plot hinges on our accepting the fact that during the campaign Stark discovers his political voice and grows into a great orator but Penns studied accent and strangely contorted diction sound more like someone campaigning for an Oscar than a governorship. After hes elected Stark grows ever more corrupt and paranoid and Jack finds himself forced for reasons I wont reveal here to betray everyone he loves his stepfather (Anthony Hopkins) his best friend (Mark Ruffalo) and his true love (Kate Winslet). Meanwhile Burdens fellow political operatives Sadie Burke and Tiny Duffy (Patricia Clarkson and James Gandolfini) hustle behind the scenes to keep Stark outfitted in his emperors new clothes. With a cast like that who can go wrong? Zaillian best known as a screenwriter (Schindlers List Gangs of New York) finds a way He manages to make Ruffalo dull Winslet plain and Clarkson shrill. Jude Law who rules when hes cast as a soulless pretty boy (Oscar Wildes beloved in Wilde a corporate shill in I [Heart] Huckabees) flounders as the tortured conscience at the center of this moral swamp. But he does struggle nobly with that tricky New Orleans accent. Gandolfinis glowering cigarette-chomping Duffy is risibly evocative of his Tony Soprano--although as Jesse Sheidlower pointed out in Slatelast year some variants of New Orleans-speak do sound almost like Brooklynese. Hopkins is indestructibly and elegantly Hopkins serving up every actor who crosses his path with fava beans and a nice Chianti. But its Zaillians overdirection that cooks this whole mess into a flavorless gumbo. He never shows you something just once when he could show it twice and never leaves a point unhammered home. A shot toward the end of the movie having to do with that Louisiana state seal at first serves as a nice visual pun for the harm wrought by Starks rotten administration. Then it appears again and you realize it was actually kind of an obvious symbol. By the third variation youre embarrassed for having ever tolerated the image in the first place. Zaillian had everything going for him fabulous actors a rollicking potboiler of a story and even a tenuous allegory for events of the present day. But this All the Kings Men is a textbook example of not knowing when to leave well enough alone. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""All the Kings Men"" with Sean Penn Jude Law Kate Winslet James Gandolfini Mark Ruffalo Patricia Clarkson Anthony Hopkins. Written and directed by Steven Zaillian based on the novel by Robert Penn Warren. 124 minutes. Rated PG-13 for an intense sequence of violence sexual content and partial nudity. Several theaters. Theres a slightly faded tired quality to the light in Steven Zaillians ""All the Kings Men"" and that seems appropriate for its milieu of the old South of grand houses hung with dusty gauze curtains and of tired barrooms where the smoke has seeped into the threadbare furnishings. But that light turns out inadvertently to be an indicator of something else Zaillians movie is a little tired too. On paper this looked to be one of the prestige movies of the year. The principal cast members led by Sean Penn had 15 Oscar nominations among them the source material was a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel still widely read today (and previously transformed into a movie more than 50 years ago) and the writer/director was the respected screenwriter of ""Schindlers List."" But something happened to ""All the Kings Men"" on the way to theaters. Due to be released around last Christmas (prime time for awards consideration) it abruptly disappeared from the release schedule to resurface many months later on a quiet September weekend. Zaillian it was reported had been busily re-editing the film after an initial cut proved disappointing. What remains is a curiosity not a terrible film by any means but one strangely lacking in impact. Some elements such as James Horners generic Big Important Movie score and Penns slightly too bombastic performance seem to be trying too hard; some such as beautifully nuanced but frustratingly fragmented work by Patricia Clarkson seem to have been lost along the way. The choice to move the action of the story from the 30s to the 50s (a decision by Zaillian according to the films press kit in order to make the story more contemporary and less ""nostalgic"") doesnt make sense -- take away the Depression and the storys entirely changed. Zaillian to be fair had taken on an almost impossible task. Warrens 1946 book is the story of a rising (and falling) Southern politician named Willie Stark (played by Penn) inspired by the colorful Louisiana governor Huey P. Long and told from the point of view of Jack Burden (Jude Law) a journalist who covers Starks election and then becomes part of the politicians machine. Warrens gorgeous prose has the leisure of a steamy Southern afternoon; his details bloom like flowers (""a light sweet rain falling out of a high sky the kind that barely whispers with a silky sound on the surface of the water you are swimming in"") and he moves between a variety of characters and settings with a sly unhurried ease. Reducing the novels 600+ pages into a two-hour narrative feature means making some big choices and in Zaillians case it means we lose much of what makes the story tick. Clarksons character a staffer involved with Stark on several levels becomes little more than a cipher and Starks political rise seems to happen strangely quickly and mostly off screen. The dramatic final act doesnt resonate as it should; the film keeps its distance as if gazing at us over a shoulder. But Zaillian his cast and director of photography Pawel Edelman (""The Pianist"") find some moments worthy of Warrens words. Kate Winslet as Jacks childhood love is photographed like a moody angel. In one shot of a late-night swim she walks away from the camera and into a moonbeam her body a black silhouette against the white light. Many of the details are spot-on such as the way a sharply raised voice in a fading mansion can make a chandeliers crystals tinkle like tiny bells. ""All the Kings Men"" is full of bits that work; unfortunately they never quite add up to a whole.

Photo Kerry Hayes REVIEW / All the stars cant put Kings Men together again 1 / 2 Back to Gallery All the Kings Men Political drama. With Sean Penn Jude Law Kate Winslet James Gandolfini Mark Ruffalo Patricia Clarkson and Anthony Hopkins. Directed by Steven Zaillian. (PG-13. 129 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When an Oscar-winning screenwriter directs his first major-budget star-laden movie you might expect it would be impressively scripted but a little shaky on the visual end. But the opposite is true in ""All the Kings Men."" It looks stunning awash in the faded greens of a Corot painting. No color could better convey the jealousy and back stabbing rampant in the political cesspool it depicts. Based on Robert Penn Warrens Pulitzer Prize-winning novel the film is about the ascension of backwater populist Willie Stark played with alarming intensity by Sean Penn to the Louisiana State Capitol. Willie is meant to evoke Huey P. Long the states flamboyant governor whose motto was ""every man a king."" Director Steven Zaillian has made a point of saying he hasnt seen the 1949 adaptation which won an Academy Award for best picture and two more for acting. He might have learned something if he had. It is essential viewing for anyone trying to understand what the heck is going on in his muddled version. The release of ""All the Kings Men"" was pushed back several months while Zaillian fiddled with it. It has a labored feel. The editing is choppy allowing little of the film to flow naturally. Character development was a large reason Zaillian got his Oscar for ""Schindlers List."" But he seems to have lost the knack for it. Willie is first seen in his home town green with inexperience as he takes on the powers that be over a school hes convinced is being shoddily constructed. When he proves right and a couple of kids die as a result hes recruited by political kingmaker Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini) to run for governor. But his candidacy is a sham meant to split the vote and get Tinys man elected. Willie makes lackluster stump speeches until big-city reporter Jack Burden (Jude Law) -- who is meant to be the films conscience except that his role like most of the others is way unwritten -- tells him hes got more fire in his belly than hes showing. Thats all Willie needs to hear. In the next scene he steps up to a podium at a county fair and begins screeching about how all the rednecks in the crowd are being manipulated and pointing a finger at Tiny. Shot in extreme close-up Penn looks like a gargoyle. You can see the veins in his temples pop. Willie sounds so hysterical that its a wonder no one calls for a straitjacket. Instead men women and children look up at him in awe. From that point on hes catnip to voters signaled by soaring background music from James Horner that least subtle of film composers. It sounds like a variation on the ""Rocky"" theme. Other than Jacks pep talk no explanation is offered for Willies miraculous transformation from hick to political wunderkind. (In the original movie he loses the race and spends the next four years honing his skills.) Even more problematic is the idealistic physician Mark Ruffalo struggles to bring to life an actor in search of a character. He appears fleetingly in the first part of the film on a moonlit beach with his sister Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet) and Jack who like the siblings is from a fine old Southern family. Waiting for the return of Dr. Stanton it occurred to me that maybe hed been edited out of the film like poor Adrien Brody in ""The Thin Red Line."" When he finally re-enters little is gained in terms of understanding his motivation which is crucial to the ending. References are made to his lofty ideals but whatever they might be is left vague. All we get are shots of him looking agonized. Its hard to think of another movie in which the talents of a first-rate cast have been so badly squandered. Aside from Penn who needed to be reined in nobody else is given anything substantial to do. Patricia Clarkson appears in the role Mercedes McCambridge won an Oscar for as Willies press attache and gatekeeper. But Clarkson is practically as much of a ghost as Ruffalo. Although unintentional her authentic Louisiana accent -- the actress is from New Orleans -- only serves to make everyone sound like their dialect coach let them down. Anthony Hopkins as a Southern gentleman who becomes Willies nemesis makes little attempt to sound like hes from anywhere in the vicinity. For some inexplicable reason the cast is heavy with Brits. Women fall all over Willie. It must be his power because Penn for all his bellowing exhibits little sexual charisma. Recalling the earthiness Broderick Crawford brought to the original I couldnt help thinking Gandolfini should have been cast as Willie. When Anne falls for the governor things get a little sticky because Jack whos become his closest confidant has had a thing for Anne since they were young. In case you dont get that Zaillian shows the same scene of them on a beach a couple of times. Other footage is repeated as well. The film opens with Willie driving to his nemesis grand old house in the middle of the night to blackmail him before flashing back to the guvs humble beginnings. The driving scene is inserted again where it belongs chronologically. Considering the major holes in the story some new scenes attempting to fill them would have been preferable to seeing the same ones again. -- Advisory Violence sexual content and nudity.

An idealistic politician (Sean Penn) appeals to the common man while playing dirty politics and slowly becomes corrupted by the system in All The Kings Men. Photo Columbia Pictures All the Kings Men 1 / 1 Back to Gallery All right all right already. Power corrupts. Sean Penn acts. Jude Law glows. All the Kings Men is a heavyweight movie with a heavyweight cast that heavyweight thinkers might analyze over espresso until their heads explode. Yeah and? And skip it. You might as well chase down a DVD of Robert Rossens 1949 classic or -- go one better -- read the corrosive Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren because theres little to recommend this new version either as art or entertainment. Its too full of itself; its too convinced of its own value to be much of any to audiences. Writer-director Steven Zaillian (A Civil Action) has adapted the book dutifully and turgidly using a hand so heavy with thematic import that it crushes the story like a grape. Somewhere in the squished remains lies a riveting morality tale about deep-fried American politics and its venal pimping players. Good luck finding it. Inspired by the fire-and-brimstone populism of legendary 1930s Louisiana Gov. (and senator) Huey Long All The Kings Men has the hallmarks of a film that yearns to be great and might be if only it werent strapped by a two-hour running time. Swaths of connecting fabric between key scenes seem absent perhaps lost to the cutting-room floor. Relationships are explained -- if that -- rather than illustrated using shorthand exposition and James Horners waterlogged orchestral score instead of vivid dramatic conflict. Whats left is directorial puffery. As Louisiana boss-man Willie Stark Penn delivers a series of ferocious finger-wagging stump speeches that display something we already knew The guy can act. Penn is a phenomenal talent with a phenomenal crest of madman hair and when he struts across the screen like a tyrannical rooster youll dive out of the way. But neither his talent nor his hair can hide the fact Starks thunderous class tirades (based on the novel and Longs own words) go precisely nowhere. We hear that his appeal to poor whites angers the gents in power that his spendthrift corruption and imperial rule irk the legislature to the point of impeachment. We hear lots of backroom jawboning about Starks political enemies -- but we hardly ever meet them. Law playing a journalist-turned-yes-man narrates the film with cloudy poetic musings that veer from a long-lost love (Kate Winslet both sad and wise) to a kindly godfather (Anthony Hopkins even sadder even wiser) to the sodden depravity of Louisiana politics. But Zaillians weighty cast expends its talent on a film that wastes it. My heart went out to poor Mark Ruffalo foundering in a spacey unrealized part and James Gandolfini who should have worked with a better dialect coach on his unfortunate Sopranos-gone-Dixie accent. Ill say this for it All the Kings Men looks good. Woozy and pastoral in some scenes fascistic and stark in others Pawel Edelmans handsome cinematography certainly dazzles just as Penns incendiary performance dazzles just as the milieus heady whiff of big-skunk politics dazzles. But the film as a whole does not. Too bloated to tell a good story and too gassy to show it its an overindulgent binge. Like Willie Stark himself Zaillians film is drunk on its own power. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Lacoste Semi-Annual Sale Up to 50% off + free shipping w/ 100 Tamrac 28"" ZipShot Mini Compact Camera Tripod for 10 + free...

Its man-of-the-people candidate is intended to split the vote so its urban candidate can cakewalk into the governors mansion. Only Willie Stark fueled by indignation and bourbon is set to find his bite his kick his burning ambition. When he tosses his prepared speech a political star is born. There is no version of ""All the Kings Men"" Robert Penn Warrens novel about the ascendency of a hick to the governors mansion that flubs this moment. Thats how powerfully it unfurls in the 1947 Pulitzer Prize- winning work inspired by the lived mythology of Louisiana Gov. Huey Long. The Kingfish as Long dubbed himself was shot by a doctor in 1935 and died. A month earlier Long had announced a run for the presidency. In 1949 director Robert Rossen put Broderick Crawford in Willies shoes and the actor won an Oscar. In writer-director Steven Zaillians long-awaited version Sean Penn locates the man from Mason City when he stands in front of a hayseed audience drawn by the barbecued pig. Stark discovers the itinerant preacher within and begins testifying. Its a connection between actor and character too long coming to make ""All the Kings Men"" necessary viewing or Stark one of Penns best performances. Decades before ""blue collar"" replaced ""redneck"" in polite conversation Willie Stark forged a bond with his folk addressing them as ""Friends rednecks suckers and fellow hicks."" Starks authentic connection becomes a performance. Isnt that politics? Finding an authentic moment and exploiting the heck out of it? As Willie enjoys the fruits of his governorship - the ""cheesecake"" the penthouses the liquor - he changes. But his pitch to his hick demographic doesnt. His arms cut the air. His trademark no-bull confrontation of the powers that be becomes just that a brand hes the No. 1 huckster for. On that freshly transformative afternoon one of Starks first targets is Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini) his former nemesis turned handler. The sleazy operative gets a blast of rhetorical buckshot. Yet later Stark makes him his lieutenant governor. Also on hand that day stands the woman who spilled the beans the night before to Willie about how he was being used the indelible Sadie Burke. In 1949 Mercedes McCambridge won an Oscar for best supporting actress for a character Warren described as ""a very smart cookie. (Who) had been around and she had learned a lot the very hard way."" Patricia Clarkson is light to McCambridges shade but she brings the only true ache to the proceedings. Jude Law plays Jack Burden our guide. The weight of telling Willies tale falls on this one-time newpaperman. That the town he grew up in is called ""Burdens Landing"" provides a hefty hint to his upbringing. Jack starts out an idealist attracted to Starks bullish approach to power. As Willie ascends he becomes his Boss tainted Boswell. ""All the Kings Men"" is of course a story of the South. And bless executive producer James Carville for restoring Warrens tale to its rightful terrain. Its a civic saga in which a young man of Southern privilege hitches his hopes to a hardscrabble hick for the good of a state and his soul. In this journey his childhood friends the Stantons Adam (Mark Ruffalo) and Anne (Kate Winslet) - just as hopeful just as privileged - also become entwined with Stark. When Jacks mentor Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins) threatens Starks power Jack will have to go digging to find dirt on the man hes loved since childhood. Last year when ""All the Kings Men"" didnt open as scheduled rumors suggested there was something wrong with Laws performance. But Law a cipher here is not the movies weakest link. Scaling a monumental work youre bound to get bruised and scraped - if you survive at all. And Warrens novel bursting with prose that is muscular and musical brutish and balletic is one of American literatures towering achievements withmore muscular prose per page than perhaps any other American work. No use getting sore that one art form trumps another. Its not the first time an outstanding book became a ponderous film. A picture is worth a thousand words? So much for that adage.

Comments All the Kings Men Ive never entirely bought Robert Rossens celebrated 1949 movie adaptation of the Robert Penn Warren novel about a fictionalized Huey Long but at least it has a coherent shape. This airless scaled-down version by Steven Zaillian (Searching for Bobby Fischer) has a credible lead performance by Sean Penn and a handsome mannerist look that suggests an almost diagrammatic sense of dramatic abstraction. Yet the unfocused story is so bereft of any clear sense of period or location that the political melodrama sometimes seems to be taking place inside a cigar box. With Jude Law (adrift) Kate Winslet James Gandolfini Mark Ruffalo Patricia Clarkson and Anthony Hopkins. PG-13 120 min.

"Movie review Sean Penns overacting dooms `All the Kings Men - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW All the Kings Men falls down Sean Penns overacting obscures this retold tale of political corruption By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  September 22 2006 ""All the Kings Men"" is a big important awards-season special with one glaring problem It doesnt have anything urgent or even interesting to say. Oh and Sean Penn staggers through it as if the Oscar were already on his mantelpiece twitching spasmodically in a furious display of capital-A Acting. Im not the first observer or even the second to liken the stars portrayal of fictional Louisiana governor Willie Stark to the late John Belushis impersonation of Joe Cocker. So make that two glaring problems.As directed by Steven Zaillian  an Oscar-winning screenwriter (``Schindlers List"") who has dabbled a bit behind the camera (``Searching for Bobby Fischer"" ``A Civil Action"") ``All the Kings Men"" is notable for its directionlessness. Zaillian has adapted the 1946 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Robert Penn Warren -- about a barnstorming Southern politician in the 1930s based closely on Huey Long -- as if the 1949 movie based on the book never existed. (It won best picture and best actor for Broderick Crawford . )Thats fine although trying to turn Warrens kudzu-choked prose into an effective cinematic experience is a task that would daunt stronger men. Heres a typical descriptive passage ``The linoleum mat was newish and the colors were still bright -- reds and tans and blues slick and varnished-looking -- a kind of glib impertinent geometrical island floating there in the midst of the cornerless shadows and the acid mummy smell and the slow swell of Time which had fed into this room day by day since long back as into a landlocked sea where the fish were dead and the taste was brackish on your tongue."" And thats just the linoleum.The books narrative voice is that of Jack Burden former journalist Starks fair-haired fixer and a scion of the old South that Willie an upcountry farmers son dearly needs on his side. Jack is a burnt idealist and hes played by Jude Law who never suggests he has been further south than the Isle of Wight. The accents passable but the bearing isnt nor is the sense of crippling nostalgia for a privileged weeping-willow youth. Laws eyes have known difficulty but never doubt.After a brief opening sequence ``All the Kings Men"" flashes back to Starks political beginnings showing how he rode a small-town schoolhouse collapse he had predicted as county treasurer to a run for governor. When he discovers hes being used as a vote-splitter by the state machine -- as personified by greasy politico Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini grinning Tony Sopranos fatcat smile) -- Willie becomes his own man. He proudly calls himself a hick and appeals to all the other hicks to reach into the capitol and ``nail em up""Once elected Willie burns his bridges with the states entrenched insiders (who mount an impeachment attempt) while building more bridges and schools and hospitals for the people -- making sure he gets a piece of the action along the line. The film is about demagoguery and corruption or it should be but Zaillian (who has been tinkering with ``Men"" in the editing room for a year) never lets us see the change occur. Willie is a terse watchful man of the people and then hes the Bossman. What happened and why arent we privy to it?Penn offers few clues. Hes fine in the early scenes as you sense Willies outrage ready to explode beneath the Sears mail-order suspenders but once he gets his dander up and begins flailing his arms the performance turns nearly laughable. Penn doesnt inhabit the character; he treats him as a marionette whose strings have been tangled. If theres a statement here about how easily voters can be swayed by charismatic charlatans its lost in the sturm und drang. We never connect with Willie Stark and thats fatal.``All the Kings Men"" busies itself with subplots about Jacks love for his childhood sweetheart Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet another Brit as ineffectively cast as Law) and about Willies misuse of Annes brother Adam (Mark Ruffalo himself spectacularly underused) a high-minded surgeon in charge of the governors new hospital. On the sidelines is Anthony Hopkins as a family friend and local power broker and its mildly amusing to see that while Law and Winslet have tortured themselves to achieve the proper suthun accent Hopkins cant be bothered. He just sounds like Anthony Hopkins.Also present are Patricia Clarkson as Willies morally lax press secretary and Jackie Earle Haley -- welcome back Moocher -- as the governors private gunman. Zaillian films them all as if theyre players in a Shakespearean tragedy and just to seal the deal cranks the knob on James Horners overbearing score to 11. At least Willie Stark trusted the hicks to think for themselves.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2006 Globe Newspaper Company.

""All the Kings Men"" a remake of Robert Rossens classic 1949 film about the rise and fall of a Southern demagogue has no center no coherence no soul and no shame. What it does have is a preening lead performance; a bizarre concatenation of accents; a dreary pseudo-gritty look; a nonsensical change of period; a surfeit of soul-sickness and a score that could be used for torturing prisoners without violating the Geneva Convention. Its a baffling botch. The people involved are neither novices nor hacks. Steven Zaillian the writer-director adapted ""Schindlers List"" for Steven Spielberg and directed ""Searching for Bobby Fischer."" Sean Penn the star -- or as Ill explain later the ostensible star -- is one of the most gifted actors of our time and hes surrounded by a fine cast that includes Jude Law Anthony Hopkins James Gandolfini Patricia Clarkson Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo. Yet the net result of all this talent is a nullity that leaves you wondering what the fuss was all about. ENLARGE There would have been no fuss if ""All the Kings Men"" hadnt set itself up against movie history literary history and American history. The Rossen film won three richly deserved Oscars -- for best picture best actor and best supporting actress. Like this new one it was adapted from Robert Penn Warrens 1946 Pulitzer prize-winning novel of the same name. And Warren modeled his hero Willie Stark on the Kingfish Huey P. Long Jr. the larger-than-life -- and legendarily dictatorial -- governor and then senator who dominated the political scene in Louisiana from the late 1920s to the mid-1930s. Willie Stark was first brought to the feature screen by Broderick Crawford until then a successful character actor known for his beefy physique and a shrewd intelligence beneath his bluff demeanor. Crawford made Willie instantly likable as well as palpably dangerous -- a self-described hick and plain-spoken man of the people but then by degrees a bully with a taste for booze a weakness for women and a spectacular lust for power. Sean Penns Willie doesnt develop by degrees but by a single quantum leap from cool to hot. For a while hes a lubricious country bumpkin making speeches of genuine banality and dubious sincerity that are none the less greeted with keening reverence by James Horners score. Then he explodes as the dreadful score explodes with him into full-bore rabble-rousing -- hands flailing wildly or waving seductively head wagging or bobbing in Hitlerian spasms voice rising from grade 3/0 sandpaper to perfervid quasi-biblical declamations. Its a phenomenon all right but a strangely unaffecting one -- how could so much energy generate so little genuine emotion? -- and a repetitive one; each time the camera comes back to him theres Willie fulminating on cue. That pattern of coming back to him eventually seems like a succession of afterthoughts. For astonishingly the Willie Stark of this remake has been reduced to the rank of redneck grotesque. Hes no longer the center of the story and Sean Penn despite his prominence in the trailers doesnt have the commanding presence that Broderick Crawford did. Now most of the attention and screen time is devoted to the airily self-loathing Jack Burden (Jude Law) the reporter who first covers the up-and-coming candidate then goes to work for him and loses his soul. And that center to put it charitably doesnt hold. How could it? Jacks moral dilemma isnt the big news here and never was. Jack started as a literary device a standard reporter-as-tour-guide first in Robert Penn Warrens novel then in Robert Rossens film. He was the narrator to be sure a self-reflective well-born Southerner torn by interesting conflicts; knowing better Jack still succumbed to the seductions of power. But he was there primarily to lead us into Willies domain and to intensify by reflected light the awful spectacle of an honest politician corrupted and finally consumed by his own demons. This new ""All the Kings Men"" fails on just about every count. The secondary performances range from absurdly self-parodying (James Gandolfini as Willies dim malefic henchman) to unexceptional (everyone else). The Southern accents defy description (or detection in the case of Anthony Hopkins who pretty much phones his performance in.) The period has been moved by two decades to the late 1940s through the 1950s even though the populist Willie Stark like Huey Long was purely a creature of the Depression (a period the filmmakers may have judged too depressing). The suppressed color palate of the cinematography recalls the glumness of ""Road to Perdition"" -- an achievement of sorts but a perverse one Dorothea Lange does the Eisenhower era. And for a movie that stresses relationships the connections between key characters are abstract or downright inscrutable. Willies assistant and ill-used lover Sadie (the wonderful Patricia Clarkson wasted in a sorry vestige of the role that won an Oscar for Mercedes McCambridge) keeps accusing her boss of two-timing her even though theres no evidence of him one-timing her. The first ""All the Kings Men"" was far from perfect as a piece of art or of artful entertainment. Like other topical films of its time it simplified its source material. Nevertheless it honored that time by dramatizing so effectively the books concerns how power is accrued how demagogues rise from the ranks of ordinary people and become the very monsters they promised to banish. The new version turns on power borrowed devoid of context from the atmosphere and period detail of earlier movies. We hear talk of Willies lawless ways but barely get a glimpse of the cops and troops who enforce his will. People make topical references to tapping the profits of Standard Oil or building a hospital to launder money but none of it has much impact because the whole of it makes little sense. In the end this murky remake functions mainly as a plain-wrapper setting for a fancy piece of acting that gets lost in a void. Who needs it? Who needed it in the first place?    DVD TIP To refresh your recollection of what constitutes a first-rate movie about the rise and fall of a demagogue see ""A Face in the Crowd"" (1957) which was directed by Elia Kazan from a brilliant script by Budd Schulberg. Andy Griffith is the sinister constantly smiling TV star Lonesome Rhodes (a character suggestive of a real-life TV star of the period Arthur Godfrey). Patricia Neal is the woman who sees the evil behind the smile yet loves Lonesome all the same.

In the case of ""All the Kings Men"" its a doubly bad idea since Broderick Crawfords Oscar-winning performance in the 1949 version is indelible. As the corrupt populist Louisiana governor Willie Stark Crawford was such a swaggering behemoth that it would take Godzilla to upstage him.Sean Penn isnt quite that. In writer-director Steve Zaillians adaptation of Robert Penn Warrens great 1946 novel Penn is given very little to do after the first half hour or so except connive and exhort and flail his arms. If you were to plot his character arc on a graph it would mostly resemble a flat line.Zaillian uses a noirish hard light palette to depict Louisiana in a drama he has transposed without much advantage from the Depression 30s to the 50s. The look is tough on the eyes. Stark who was essentially Warrens stand-in for Louisiana governor and senator Huey Long may have seen the world in terms of black and white but theres no reason why we have to. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The best parts of the movie come early when we first see Willie learning the political ropes. A Baton Rouge operator Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini doing his level best not to sound like Tony Soprano) pegs Willie to run for governor because unbeknownst to him Tiny wants to split the redneck vote and reelect the incumbent. The scene where Willie intuits how he is being used is very fine; were watching the birth pangs of his considerable political smarts. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 But then Zaillian shows us a montage of Willie rallying the poor with his own authentic voice. The trouble is the ""hicks"" he appeals to are never more than faces in the crowd and so the effect is unintentionally condescending. If we are to truly experience the downfall of a man who once claimed to be on the side of the working poor shouldnt they have more personality than a herd of cattle?As overwrought as Penn is at least theres a sordid pleasure in observing his attempt to turn himself into a beer-bellied cracker. But as Willies counterpart Jack Burden the highborn newspaperman who becomes his right-hand man Jude Law takes up far more screen time to far less effect. Law works a lot because he is skillful and because his patrician handsomeness is supposed to confer quality on a production. (Its the position that David Niven used to occupy.) But hes not a very exciting actor.We never see Jacks gravitation to the dark side - i.e. Willies side. He just seems like a slumming newspaperman who wants to spice things up for himself. Since Willie represents the populist ascendancy in the South Jacks involvement with him ought to signal a seismic shift in the zeitgeist.Likewise when Willie orders Jack to dig up dirt on Jacks godfather Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins) who is attempting to impeach Willie Jack barely registers discomfort. Or glee for that matter. The blahness of Laws performance is in such contrast to Penns banshee contortions that the movie seems to split in two whenever they are on screen together. The other actors including Patricia Clarkson Kate Winslet and Mark Ruffalo cant do much to seal the crack.The prime mover in getting this film remade was James Carville who is listed as co-executive producer. This might lead you to believe that ""All the Kings Men"" is politically relevant for this election season but its no more or less so than say ""Julius Caesar"" and the orations are a lot windier. The only emotional resonance this film had for me was unintended As one of the last films shot in New Orleans before Katrina its an unwitting elegy for a city and a state of mind.

Long--this tale of corruption compromise and betrayal never gets under the skin of its subject. How does Stark turn from idealist to thug? Thats the question you want answered and Zaillian doesnt tell you. His focus true to the novel is on Jude Laws journalist Jack Burden who gets sucked into Starks orbit and loses his moral bearings. But we dont care about Burden or his mopey pursuit of his childhood sweetheart (Kate Winslet). This stiff-in-the-joints movie has little feel for its setting or period and crucial chunks seem to have been left on the cutting-room floor.

This intelligent sometimes gruesome thriller based on a novel by Giles Foden pairs this real-life dictator with the fictional Nick Garrigan (James McAvoy) a boyish idealistic but deluded Scottish doctor who serves Amin as personal physician and close adviser realizing too late how much blood stains his own hands. Macdonald (""Touching the Void"") has no trouble keeping the audience on the edge of its seat but the merger of fact with sexed-up fiction can be too Hollywood for its own good Garrigans affair with one of Amins wives (Kerry Washington) is a dubious contrivance as is the insertion of the famous Entebbe hijacking (which is not in Fodens book).

Ergo a mention of Bill Clinton is hard to resist even if the Clinton I have in mind at the moment is the then Arkansas governor who nearly derailed his political future at the 1988 Democratic convention while the then Texas treasurer Ann Richards -- the late great -- enhanced her career with a speech as rousing as Clintons was stultifying. Because writer-director Steven Zaillians version stultifies too especially when compared with Robert Rossens fiery 1949 Oscar winner. How could such dullness defeat the retelling when Willie Stark is one of the most vivid characters in 20th-century American popular culture? Robert Penn Warren who wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1946 novel on which both movies are based modeled his fictional politician after Louisianas real outsize governor Huey Long. Stark is a self-described Southern ""hick"" who marshals the votes of fellow hicks to rise from hayseed obscurity to great power. But having tasted that power and having learned that bad cant easily be separated from good when it comes to politicking the complicated Stark (motivated in fair measure by grassroots idealism) soon cant distinguish worthy ends from corrupt means. Emboldened by success Starks rage at the elites who used to mock him as a ""sacrificial goat"" overtakes him and he becomes a monster even as he builds the people roads schools and hospitals. And having transformed his administration into something close to a dictatorship he falls a bigheaded Humpty Dumpty at the hands of an inevitable American counterrevolution. Sean Penn never has to go far to tap into rage. As a fledgling politician manipulated by political cronies (including James Gandolfini as a backroom power broker) his Stark tries a scene or two of humility with his hair springing up from his head like wood smoke and his speech favoring a Dead Man Walking drawl about how he drinks orange soda pop because ""the wife dont favor drinkin."" But clearly Penn is itching to segue into full-blown righteous apoplexy. Zaillian has said that he made a point of not watching Rossens version which is too bad -- the filmmaker might have studied how to match the heat of the political cautionary tale with equally steamed-up personal subplots something weirdly imbalanced in the new version. Penn on the other hand appears to have done some viewing homework cataloging the components of Broderick Crawfords blazing Oscar-winning performance before coming up with his own even more ornate personification of idealism twisted into demagoguery. Penn orates in gumbo cadences as he leads the crowd in a rally chant of ""Nail em up Nail em up"" (referring to those who would get in Starks way). Meanwhile all around him Penns costars retract in defeat. Most recessive of all is a daintified Jude Law as Jack Burden the dabbling newspaper reporter of genteel Southern lineage who becomes Starks staffer his pawn and the storys narrator. Tripped up by his own distracting Britishness the actor has also been cheated of much of the steamy melodrama embraced by John Ireland in the original. Patricia Clarkson plays spin doctor Sadie Burke -- a Mary Matalin before her time -- with an unusable excess of refinement and none of Mercedes McCambridges riveting banked craziness. As Anne Stanton the rich debutante drawn by Willies magnetism and turned off by Jacks mildness Kate Winslet likewise eschews the streak of fine Southern hooey previously displayed by Joanne Dru at the characters expense. That Anthony Hopkins coasts with one of his lazily highfalutin Welsh-accented Wise Elder performances as the tragically upstanding Judge Irwin captures everything screwy about casting big-name stars for their big names rather than their suitability then abandoning them to solve (or be criticized for failing to solve) the problems inherent in those market-driven casting decisions. Clinton operative James Carville is listed as an executive producer of this All the Kings Men and its easy to see why the salty political pro would be drawn to the material. Why then scrape all the spice from the meat -- serving as Zaillian does a movie of so much blander political and for that matter novelistic proportions? Its as if the producers feared audiences dont favor flavor.

"All the Kings Men | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; all-the-king-s-men ) All the Kings Men (United States 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli With remakes the likes of Poseidon The Pink Panther and The Wicker Man already dotting 2006s cinematic landscape why not provide a new take on the 1949 political thriller All the Kings Men? In actuality writer/director Steven Zaillian claims not to have based this on the earlier movie preferring instead to return to the original source material. Robert Penn Warrens Pulitzer Prize winning novel All the Kings Men is a loosely fictionalized account of the rise and fall of Louisiana governor Huey Long. Regardless of what inspired the screenplay its a bad fit. All the Kings Men is a patchwork of poor choices and uneven results the most obvious of which is its pacing. With inappropriate flash-forwards and badly placed flashbacks All the Kings Men lurches unsteadily forward amidst variable performances and impressive cinematography. All the Kings Men follows the rise to prominence of the ""governor of the people"" Willie Stark (Sean Penn) who wins the governorship of Louisiana in the early 1950s by a landslide victory. His pro-education anti-business agenda earns him some powerful enemies and charges of cronyism and corruption abound. Despite starting his political career as an idealist Stark has become a ruthless politician using blackmail and other forms of coercion to crush his enemies. His right-hand man is former journalist Jack Burden (Jude Law) who comes from money and is torn between supporting his friend and betraying his roots. Starks most dangerous enemy is Judge Irwin (Anthony Hopkins) who is Jacks godfather and refuses to bend when Stark attacks. Also in the mix are Jacks former flame Anne Stanton (Kate Winslet) and her brother Adam (Mark Ruffalo). Annes closeness to Stark deals a blow to Jack. I have heard it said that Sean Penn delivers a great performance as Stanton but that impression is in error. Channeling the pulpit-pounding essence of Jonathan Edwards Penn spits fire and brimstone in one of the most laughably over-the-top portrayals of his career. With the exception of I Am Sam I have never been embarrassed by one of the actors performances until now. Penns work is so one-dimensional and cartoonish that theres no hope of Stark becoming more than a blustering caricature. Adding to the problem is that Jack the character at the films emotional core has no personality. Jude Law underplays the role leaving us with a personality void. Kate Winslets contribution is negligible. Only Anthony Hopkins emerges unscathed. The few scenes in which he participates are virtually the only ones in All the Kings Men that ring with any degree of authenticity or urgency. Although structure and tone are two of the movies most glaring problems there is another serious flaw. The relationship between Jack and Anne is inadequately developed. Since this is the fulcrum upon which many subplots rest the cavalier manner in which it is presented (primarily through a bunch of throw-away flashbacks) is indefensible. It undercuts too much of the films potential power. Further damage is done by a nattering voiceover narrative that quickly becomes annoying although hardly more so than the overly melodramatic score contributed by James Horner. The only technical aspect worth singling out for praise is Pawel Edelmans cinematography. All the Kings Men looks consistently great (although I could have done without the black-and-white directorial ""flourish"" employed during the climactic scene). Part of the underlying problem with All the Kings Men is the inherent difficulty of adapting such a complex novel into a screenplay of reasonable length. (The 1949 film suffered from some of the same problems.) As good a writer as Zaillian is the task is beyond him. There are some very good scenes (the key interaction between Jack and Judge Irwin is compelling) but the overall story feels paradoxically both rushed and overlong. Those familiar with the novel will undoubtedly agree that reading it is a more satisfying experience than watching this disappointing film. One expects more - much more in fact - with cast of this caliber.

Overstuffed and fatally miscast ""All the Kings Men"" never comes to life. Despite location shooting and obvious sincerity this second screen version of Robert Penn Warrens Pulitzer Prize-winning 1946 novel about a corrupt populist Southern governor not unlike Louisianas Huey P. Long doesnt seem authentic for a moment due to a glittering array of actors who look and sound like theyve come from different ends of the English-speaking world -- which in fact they have. Absent any point of engagement to become involved in the characters the film feels stillborn and is unlikely to stir public excitement even in an election year. Willie Stark (like Long) came as close to demonstrating the possibilities of a uniquely American fascism as any politician. The source of his power was Southern hicks the poor the disenfranchised the resentful have-nothings on whose behalf Stark promised if elected to stick a pole through the rich ol boys and cook em over an open pit. Given some of their past projects and involvements theres no doubt its this almost always pertinent political component that inspired project originator James Carville producer Mike Medavoy and writer-director Steve Zaillian to want to remake a film that won the Oscar for best picture; indeed its the only reason there could be to get excited about such a venture. All the greater the disappointment then that this long-delayed production bears scarcely a pulse much less the passion of its characters and filmmakers behind it. Even the period seems uncertain The story unquestionably belongs to the Depression era when Long himself reigned. But the cars and a few other details look somewhat more recent and one is astonished to learn at the end that the story has run all the way up to 1954. No doubt the rationale was to make the story seem less distant and thus somehow more relevant but the move does nothing but underline the films imprecision and incredibility. Stark played with untiring ferociousness and ceaseless arm-waving and gesticulating by Sean Penn is the poor farm boy and political small-timer paged by monied operator Tiny Duffy (James Gandolfini) to run for governor in a covert attempt to split the redneck vote and thus hand the election to the fat-cat incumbent. When Willie discovers this his rage incites him to discover his true voice as an orator publicly attacking Duffy along with all the other back-scratching Baton Rouge bigwigs. The from-one-hick-to-another approach works wonders and its here where Willie establishes his rapport with the people that the film should soar. But we never see Willie mixing it up with the hoi polloi in any meaningful way as Zaillian simply offers standard-issue reaction shots of unknown extras giving Willie the thumbs-up without frankly the kind of hee-hawing and ""You tell em Willie"" responses youd expect to see. Even before it gets this far however the film bogs down in the hushed lugubrious narration of disillusioned newspaperman Jack Burden who has gone on to work for Willie and is clearly fated to be buried along with his bottle of booze. Three of the seven leading roles are played by British actors; of them Law is the only one to even attempt a Southern accent (strange in that the Brits beginning with Vivien Leigh used to be so good at it). But he then chooses to speak as quietly as possible in the likely hope that the inadequacies of his accent will be all but indecipherable. As to the others Kate Winslet as the unconsummated love of Jacks youth speaks plain old American while Anthony Hopkins playing a powerful judge in what could be called the Burl Ives or Charles Durning role sounds as though hes from Louisiana by way of Wales and London. To fit with Winslet who plays his sister Mark Ruffalo goes easy on the Southernisms as well. As for Gandolfini well you can take Tony Soprano outta Joisey but you cant take the Joisey outta Tony Soprano. Overall high school productions of ""Lil Abner"" make more concerted stabs at down-home authenticity than this picture does. Shorn of the vitality and vulgarity that should course through the veins of any picture about politicians and newspapermen especially in the setting and time in question this ""All the Kings Men"" plays out solemnly along the lines of a Greek tragedy as Willie Stark becomes the epitome of the sort of power-hording fear-inspiring special-interests-favoring thoroughly corrupt blowhard he had once attacked. This is supposed to be a cautionary tale about populism run amok but it doesnt put the chill in you because the film never connects to real life. Once Willie is installed in the governors office the pic tries to stir interest in a scam concerning the construction of a medical center that implicates Ruffalos earnest young medic whose sister Jacks long-ago love is having a secret affair with Willie. Climactic stretch involves Willies attempt to avoid impeachment by forcing the ever-loyal Jack to dig up dirt on Hopkins Judge Irwin an old-school gent unalterably opposed to the governors seamy ways. Denouement is impressive for having been staged at the 30s deco-style Louisiana State Capitol building that Huey Long built and where he was later assassinated. But the sequence becomes protracted and pretentious in its treatment. The film is luxurious to a fault where it should have been dirty sweaty and gritty. One rarely even feels Louisianas sticky heat through the cool blues grays and greens of lenser Pawel Edelmans palette. James Horners full-blown mournful score further emphasizes the projects grandiose proportions.
