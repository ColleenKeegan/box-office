As the closing credits roll on his debut feature ""Freddy Got Fingered"" the last words uttered onscreen by Tom Green are ""What the fuck am I doing?"" -- as accurate and unfettered a confession by a filmmaker as you could hope for especially at the end of what is one of the most brutally awful comedies ever to emerge from a major studio. It isnt simply the flagrant endless leaps into the netherworld of crudeness that define Greens pic After all flagrant crudeness is the comics metier what his MTV-reared fans expect and what he apparently loves doing most. Rather the film is thoroughly derailed by a complete lack of comic shape rhythm and sensibility more like the worlds most expensive home movie than anything close to the standards of even the most lowest-common-denominator Hollywood pics geared to young auds. This is very possibly the fitting end of the gross-out comedy cycle commercially undone by both an R rating thats actually generous and inevitably deadly word-of-mouth. After being fingered ""Freddy"" will collect dust in the video bins. The crazed antics of Jim Carrey in his Farrelly brothers phase and the potty humor of ""Deuce Bigalow"" seem quaint relics of yore compared with Greens extreme obsession with human and animal body parts which the comic hopes will fill the bill for young guys looking for the latest insane thing at the multiplex -thats if those guys are able to slip past the multiplex ticket guardians. But beyond Green extending his outrageous stunts from the limits of MTV to the bigscreen theres a half-examined misanthropy running through the pic along with a wide-open glee at humiliating fine actors that leaves a truly acrid aftertaste. Things begin innocently enough with Gord Brody (Green) still living at home in Oregon with parents Jim (Rip Torn) and Julie (Julie Hagerty) but working up his confidence to go to L.A. and become an animator. Jim dismisses Gords love as ""doodling"" but happily sends his eldest son to SoCal -- even if this makes younger straight-arrow bro Freddy (Eddie Kaye Thomas) jealous. En route Gord stops at a stud farm to fondle a horses notably erect penis. In L.A. the penile imagery continues as Gord working at the Hollywood Cheese Sandwich Co. hoists a giant sausage between his legs and stomps around on the assembly line. Busting past security Gord gets into the office of animation mogul Mr. Davidson (Anthony Michael Hall) and pitches his stupid cartoon ideas about animal characters which Davidson -- virtually the only sane character in the movie -- tells him are well stupid. Defeated Gord drives back to Portland with Davidsons advice (""Get inside your animals"") in his head. Gord stops by the highway at the sight of a dead deer guts it and crawls inside it wearing the deer carcass until hes hit head-on by a big-wheeler. Gord alas isnt dead and reinserts himself back into the Oregon household where the first thing he does is build a skateboard ramp in the driveway. His pal Darren (Harland Williams) tries out the ramp and breaks his leg -- which is an invitation for Gord not to call an ambulance but to lick the protruding bloody bone and gristle in Darrens knee. At the hospital Gord flirts with (in what may or may not be a joke) nurse Betty (Marisa Coughlan) only to discover that shes in a wheelchair. Visiting Darren Gord notices that his neighbor is a woman about to give birth. He yanks the baby out of the womb cuts the umbilical cord with his teeth and revives the unresponsive infant by flinging it around on the cord like a lasso spraying blood everywhere. Viewers who can take no more will miss such nifty items as Betty demanding sex from Gord by asking him to whip her hard on her knees she in turn fondling the remnants of Gords own 28-year-old umbilical cord still attached to his belly and a restaurant scene that ends with Green shooting seltzer all over the room for no reason. Theyll also miss the bits where Gord plays on a keyboard with strings of meat attached to his fingers and prances around in a suit worn backward. All of these episodes are disjointed with no order or sense that one thing is connected to anything else other than all of it pushing Torns Jim to the limit when he pulls down his pants and wiggles his tush in front of Gord. Gords final attempt to destroy his family works when he accuses Dad in a therapy session of ""fingering"" Freddy. This has the extremely unfunny effect of sending Freddy whos 25 to live in an institution for sexually molested children. Ugliness is the last refuge of the comedian who has run out of ideas and its here when the true nature of the script by Green and Derek Harvie becomes clear. Green is such an abysmal actor that he cant even play himself. Hes an arrested adolescent whose proper place in a movie is the kind of in-and-out cameos he gives to Shaquille ONeal and Drew Barrymore. At feature length and in nearly every scene hes the human form of the car alarm that wont stop. Sadder though is watching a fine actor like Torn literally sent into the goo not so much directed as prodded with a pitchfork. Credits report animals werent harmed. The state of film comedy is another matter.

(20th Century Fox) See Tom Green shock-performer from MTV do every gross thing he can - from supping on cow teats to climbing inside the bloody carcass of a deer. Few of these gross-out antics have much to do with the story. Oh yeah the story. Green plays Gordon a 28-year-old slacker living at home who wants to be a great animator. His verbally abusive daddy (Rip Torn in his worst role of all time) has no faith in him. Gordons mom suffers quietly. But we suffer worst of all. In a sense this is a horror film worse than anything Andy Kaufman could dream up in which Green tries to outgross himself. Well he succeeds if thats any kind of welcome news to you. Later on this movie. ""Freddy Got Fingered"" (R 95 minutes) - Contains relentless obscenity slapstick violence depictions of animal abuse and disgusting gross-out comedy designed to offend almost everyone.

(20th Century Fox) Has it come to this? Yes it has. If ever a movie testified to the utter creative bankruptcy of the Hollywood film industry it is the abomination known as ""Freddy Got Fingered"" written and directed and overbearingly starring an odd potato of a man named Tom Green. Yes I know whom he is married to. Yes I know he is still famous on MTV. Yes I know he had cancer in a nasty spot. Thats fine but this fellow is simply not ready to make a movie for a major American studio and may never be. He has no skills. He has no gifts. He has no instincts. He has no resources. He knows nothing about story structure comedy construction visual humor jokes punch lines satire parody or any other comic art. He only has his peculiar species of nerve which evidently some grown-up who should have known better confused with ability. The movie is simply not professional. Its not even by the lowest standards of Republic B-westerns in the 30s or bad cheap horror films in the 50s releasable. You wonder What part of ""unfunny"" doesnt Tom Green understand? Green has but three comic chops which he repeats endlessly over the longest 95 minutes in human history. The first is disgust When he doesnt know what else to do he crams something into his mouth babbles incoherently and treats all and sundry to the vision of clots of wet mulched food spewing from his pie hole. Or - twice twice - he uses his hands to sexually relieve an animal in a state of tumescence following that act to its necessarily torrential conclusion. The second is cruelty. He likes the shock effect of blood particularly when it erupts from the bodies of those victims usually considered sacrosanct such as small children and animals. A continuing refrain is the angel-faced neighbor boy whose dainty mug is shattered beaten bashed and whacked time and time again. Its not even that this is debased or immoral particularly in a culture with a major child abuse (and consequent crime) problem. Its that it simply isnt funny. The first time it happens theres a kind of a giggly sense of shock from the younger audience members; after that dead silence. Greens third joke is Green himself with his repertoire of infantile reaction; he repeats his words over and over louder and louder froggy eyes kabonging voice rising body language becoming shriekingly anxious. Or when words fail him (on the 20th reiteration) he begins to slink around spastically in that long-legged long-armed slightly effeminate crane-style of his. A shrewd professional director - that is a comedy professional - might be able to get something out of this. In an earlier age Greens weirdness would have been studied polished honed and then used sparingly in marginal roles as it developed. He might then have had an actual career. Today it seems that mere notoriety is enough to get oneself a major screen shot and the millions of bucks it takes to invent a movie. No talent necessary. The plot is one-dimensional. Green who hogs every scene to diminishing returns plays 28-year-old Gord Brody a basement-dwelling loser who harbors dreams of being an animator which of course inflames his brutal dad (Rip Torn in the worst performance of his distinguished career). The movie follows Gord to L.A. from his Portland Ore. home where he fails to impress an animation executive (Anthony Michael Hall) who does at least counsel him to get ""into"" his characters more. Thats why Gord carves a wound into a deer carcass and climbs inside. He returns to his dads basement and the movie chronicles his next few months. They consist mainly of sex (with a paraplegic girlfriend whose idea of foreplay is having him cane her dead legs) lies (to and about father up to the point of accusing his father of sexual molestation of a brother) and tripe which this twisted sister of a mutant thinks is funny. Eventually his hate-love dance with dad enables him to get ""into"" a character - the movie maintains this but it never convinces us - and he creates a cartoon version of his own life and his fathers reimagined among zebra-centaurs (I am not making this up). He returns to L.A. sells his TV concept in five seconds and armed with a million-dollar check heads back to Portland for some lame payback. Why? There is no why. There is only for now Tom Green and a comic sensibility so pitiful its neither comic nor a sensibility. Its just a humiliation for people on both sides of the screen. ""Freddy Got Fingered"" (95 minutes and dying at area theaters) is rated R for atrocity brazenness banality and IQ reduction (and a major obscenity repeated 7000 times).

Photo HANDOUT Thumbs Down for Freddy / Tom Green tests limits of patience in noxious Fingered 1 / 3 Back to Gallery FREDDY GOT FINGERED Starring Tom Green Rip Torn. Directed and co-written by Green. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Today a Trojan horse arrives outside your megaplex a gift from our neighbors to the north. Canadas most brutal import since Anne Murray will climb from inside and gleefully try to hump it. Tom Green doesnt want your daughters he wants your farm animals. In any case hide your heifers and please say a nervous ""hello"" to the tragically awful ""Freddy Got Fingered"" in which the lanky baby-man molests no fewer than four innocent creatures -- one of which is roadkill -- and fails to call the next morning. Elsewhere he births a baby then tries to sever the cord with his teeth and sprays Rip Torn with elephant semen the way the San Francisco Fire Department puts out fires. Green co-wrote the film with pal Derek Harvie. He also directs and stars. Ordinarily this is called a tour de force. But Green is no Warren Beatty; hes no Barbra Streisand either. Hell never light himself so favorably. That is not to say that Green is not a camera hog; he just also happens to be a hog. For him ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is both a digression and a leap forward. Having outgrown the pranks of his MTV chat show he has gone about making his movie with annoying pig-in-slop enthusiasm. Rather than be charming or even amusing Green fights to take comedy (that poor mad cow) into more excruciating territory. Playing a would-be cartoonist named Gord Greens mere presence on the big screen widens our social definition of arrested development. After 28 years at home with his folks (Torn and Julie Hagerty) Gord strikes out on his own behind the wheel of a used Le Baron convertible. He has a disastrous but enlightening run-in with a television exec played by Anthony Michael Hall and then its back to the familial dinner table where the tension with his pop resumes. Dad wants him to eat Moms roast beef. Gord wants a chicken sandwich. Moms played by Julie Hagerty so she has to sit there and take it. But the audience doesnt and after Green skins a deer and dances roadside in its pelt its doubtful it will. The forecast calls for walkouts as though someone had parted the Red Sea. A premature exit of course means missing a) Marisa Coughlan as a paraplegic good girl who lives to install jets on her wheelchair and dreams of doing fellatio on Gord; b) Rip Torn reacquainting himself with the drunken shame of his early years; c) the reason the movie is even called what its called. Freddy (Eddie Kaye Thomas) is Gords slightly younger brother and in a group therapy session Gord fibs that his father molested poor independent Freddy. This moment -- the cruelest by far excusing the Drew Barrymore and Shaq cameos -- comes an hour into the film which leaves the remaining 30 minutes to parse the consequences. At its heart and at its most tolerable ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is a groundless slacker psychodrama a bucolic bastard cousin to ""Rebel Without a Cause."" (Gord wants to be an animator like Charles Schulz but Green acts like an accidental Jim Henson vision of James Dean a hirsute bug-eyed Muppet hatchling.) As an extra in ""Superstar"" as a footnote in ""Road Trip"" or even as cherub bait in ""Charlies Angels"" Green might be funny. But as the driving force behind 93 minutes of defiance of intelligence it stops being funny and somehow begins feeling nearly significant. As Americas brow grows lower with every Farrelly brothers picture decency seems to have hit the skids. In a perfect mall ""Freddy Got Fingered"" would be a declaration of war. But the film is like watching Ozzy Osbourne bite the head off a rubber bat -- its only almost heinous. Greens clearest antecedent is maverick-on-a-shoestring John Waters who on his least fresh day could find some zip to lend Green. Throughout Green is strapped for rhythm. As a prankster he puts a postmodern face on the ageless problem of how to make em laugh. Hes not the comedian. Hes the whole joke -- the setup the punch line the unmitigated explosion of 19-year-old laughter. When it goes wrong everything around him falls apart too. Advisory This movie contains raw language and graphic images.

"USATODAY.com - Greens Freddy is yuck gone amok Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 04/30/2001 - Updated 1235 PM ET Greens Freddy is yuck gone amok By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY 20th Century Fox Tom Green directed this piece of uh work. Freddy Got Fingered (out of four) Stars Tom Green Rip Torn Marisa Coughlan Director Tom Green Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating R for crude sexual and bizarre humor strong language Those who are moved to take pity upon Tom Green the latest MTV-enabled moron who excels at being a public nuisance might describe Freddy Got Fingered -- his unfortunately titled directorial debut -- as a dada-esque exorcism of daddy-instilled demons. In what meager autobiographical plot he could scrape together for this random series of numbingly offensive stunts Green is a fidgety mental case from Portland Ore. who dreams of being an animator in Hollywood. But his ideas are as underdeveloped as his muscle tone. So he lives at home in his parents basement a 28-year-old lay-about whose mere presence is enough to cause his blue-collar bully of a father (Rip Torn in matching Green-style goatee) to bray and snort with belittling insults. Those who flinch as a paraplegic moans in ecstasy when beaten with a bamboo stick or a bloody deer carcass is worn like a roadkill cape might prefer to label Freddy a steaming heap of doo-doo. Just when you thought nothing-sacred cinema could stoop no lower Green guides us through the clogged sewage system of his demented mind. Plenty of pointlessly perverse pranks float by. At least Freddy is awful in some horrifyingly new ways. How do you top child abuse? Childbirth abuse complete with a newborn being swung about by its umbilical cord. How do you outdo the manual stroking of a horses male member? The manipulation of an elephants even more substantial male member of course followed by a violent explosion of semen. But nothing onscreen is abused quite so savagely as the audience itself. Not since Andy Kaufmans reign of terror has a supposed funnyman been so self-indulgently persistent in testing a fans patience. The Green contingent in the theater pale scruffy guys who look as if they really live in their parents basements started off laughing heartily. But chuckles were soon replaced by groans. And the groans dissolved into a bored silence. Why does Green hang sausages from the ceiling with strings attached to his keyboard-playing hands which causes the meat products to bob like a butcher shop in an earthquake? Because he can. Why does he say nearly every line twice? Why does he say nearly every line twice? Because if he didnt the movie would be barely 45 minutes long. More puzzling is why an esteemed actor like Torn took a part where he exposes his flabby rear and encourages Green to sodomize him. A tribute perhaps to Ned Beatty in Deliverance? As the film wraps up Green shows a Kreskin-class ability to connect with the thoughts of viewers who havent already escaped. In a crowd scene someone carries a sign that reads ""When the (expletive) is this movie going to end?"" Inept as a director and misbegotten as a performer Green is to be admired for pulling off at least one coup. Hes gotten someone to foot the bill for what amounts to a 90-minute therapy session.

He jabbers on about ""40 million f--ing deutsche marks"" working his way into a self-important froth of yuppie hysteria. Moments later hes standing on a bar smashing the violin he has grabbed from the dining-room string quartet grimacing like a flipped-out Quasimodo as he screams with self-loathing sarcastic pique ""Its a fancy restaurant"" So much for the high point of Freddy Got Fingered. The rest of the movie consists for the most part of Greens close encounters with meat and goo human and otherwise. He hangs steaks from his ears and plays an electric piano with his fingers tied to long strings that have sausages dangling from them. He slits open a deer thats lying dead on the highway obsessively draping himself in its organs and bloody pelt. He delivers a baby severing the umbilical cord with his teeth (a gag stolen from John Waters 1975 Female Trouble -- believe me it was funnier there) then twirls the infant around like a tetherball with whats left of the cord. In one notable variation on the meat theme Green is in the basement when Rip Torn as his loathsome abusive father pulls down his own pants bares his jiggly white buttocks and playfully demands (or does he mean it?) to get sodomized. To anyone familiar with Tom Green its no surprise that he spends much of Freddy Got Fingered which he directed and cowrote caught in paroxysms of screaming agony. The surprise is that many in the audience may feel like joining him. To dismiss this movie for being ""offensive"" would be to offer it high praise. With its laborious and slipshod stunts its hero who veers back and forth without warning or logic from being a cowering fussbudget to an id-happy gross-out demon Freddy Got Fingered isnt remotely an outrage. Its a disaster a case of a freakish yet dangerously one-note personality too besotted with ego to understand that theres got to be more to a feature-length comedy than his own mocking seething look-at-how-smart-I-am-about-being-stupid self. Green has a hyperactive computer addicts stringbean body a wimps receding profile (his goatee seems to be shouting ""I know Im here to fill out this guys loser face"") and the rabid staring eyes of a deranged lizard. On MTV hes a blitzkrieg nerd devious yet infantile blankly indifferent to everything in the world but his ability to get a rise out of you. His refusal to radiate anything that resembles compassion or concern for other people (on his infamous MTV cancer special he barely evinced concern for himself) is the key to what in small doses can be funny and bracing about him. Hes the misanthrope as scalawag prankster perpetually standing outside of himself staring with conspiratorial glee at the Americas-sickest-home-video gags that he dreams up and performs in order to tweak jolt and command our increasingly jaded attention spans. To raise moral objection to Greens antics is to play right into his hand. It would be like complaining that a skunk sprays you; that quite simply is what a skunk does. (A more relevant issue might be Why does our culture so enjoy getting sprayed?) Yet Tom Greens remorseless showbiz cool turns out to be dependent on the relative spontaneity of pop-trash ""reality"" television. On The Tom Green Show hes an unholy ringmaster - Ernie Kovacs with the soul of Butt-head - who is always saying implicitly Look at what Im getting away with Look at what were all watching on television In Freddy Got Fingered Green plays a ""character"" a skateboard-punk loser named Gord whose daddy didnt wuv him who dreams of turning his secret cartoon sketches into an animated show and who can barely hold on to his job of piling American cheese slices onto submarine sandwiches. Who wants to see a poor pitiful struggling Tom Green? If hes not the reptilian master of all that surrounds him hes just a weak-chinned antic pest who cant act. Gord meets a girlfriend of sorts. Her name is Betty (Marisa Coughlan) shes a button-nose cutie in a wheelchair and their romance consists of him whacking her paralyzed legs until she squeals with pleasure and her following that up by offering him enthusiastic oral sex. This is about as close to a genuine relationship as there is in the movie but then the ultimate relationship in Freddy Got Fingered is the love affair between Tom Green and bodily fluids -- namely blood fresh-from-the-udder cow milk and elephant sperm. You may end up wanting to take a shower. That is if youre still awake.

And thats being kind In this story About that title... Hagerty Torn Hang your heads RELATED STORIES SITES By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- The new comedy from Tom Green ""Freddy Got Fingered"" is quite simply the worst movie ever released by a major studio in Hollywood history. Co-written directed by and starring Green this train wreck disguised as a movie is a case study of an annoyingly vibrant attack of arrested adolescent development. There is not one single moment in the entire 86 minutes of this film that is the least bit redeemable on any level. The films press kit describes ""Freddy Got Fingered"" as a story about an unemployed young man living in his parents basement who battles with his father (played by Rip Torn) over the sons future. The son Gord (Green) is supposedly ""just an overgrown boy with a wild sense of humor"" according to the spin. Yeah right. And Jeffrey Dahmer was just a misunderstood guy with a taste for exotic meat. Gords (read that Greens) taste in comedy is big on shock and schlock but devoid of any genuine humor what so ever In following his dream of becoming an animator for television cartoons Gords diverted by one inane sick situation after another -- none of which has anything to do with the films plot by the way. Oops forgive the use of the word ""plot."" Thats term doesnt apply to this miserable mess. About that title... A sample of the mess Gord gets up close and personal with the private parts of an aroused stallion; beats the legs of his wheelchair-bound girlfriend with a cane; and after delivering a baby he swings the newborn around the room by its umbilical cord. Ha-ha Mom gets spattered with blood In case anyone is interested Gords younger brother is named Freddy. Gord accuses their father of sexually molesting him -- hence the title. Now thats comedy. People will roll in the aisle right out the door and to the nearest bathroom.

"Freddy Got Fingered | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; freddy-got-fingered ) Freddy Got Fingered (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli Before I embark upon an extended streak of name-calling and Tom Green-bashing let me say a few words about the subjective nature of comedy. Everyone has a different opinion of exactly what constitutes good humor. For some people its Victor Borga. For others its Monty Python. And for still others its Tom Green. (Hopefully those in the latter category arent numerous.) I like to think that I have a fairly broad-based sense of humor (I suppose everyone says the same thing). I can laugh equally hard at Mark Russell This Is Spinal Tap American Pie and Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Green however doesnt do anything for me. On those rare occasions when my channel surfing has brought me to his MTV show I have rarely stopped for more than a minute or two before moving on. Im sure Green fans inasmuch as there are Green fans will delight in the cesspool that is Freddy Got Fingered. The film probably delivers what they are expecting. Having said that however I have to report that this motion picture is arguably the worst piece of cinematic crap I have ever experienced theatrically. Hyperbole you wonder? I looked through my list of zero-star movies and couldnt find one entry (except the immortal Zombie Vs. Mardi Gras which was a straight-to-video release) that ranked as more difficult to endure. Words like abomination and travesty dont do this movie justice. Sitting through Freddy Got Fingered was one of the most depressing experiences in my 10 years of reviewing films. Its not even enjoyable on a campy level. Its just bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. Freddy Got Fingered takes gross-out humor to a new low. In the process it uncovers another layer of the MPAAs inconsistency. How could anything this foul be granted an R-rating? Eyes Wide Shut Requiem for a Dream and The War Zone were all awarded NC-17s in their original cuts but Freddy Got Fingered is given an R? What are the members of the ratings board inhaling?? And its not as if the humor is so subtle that they could have missed something. At any rate Freddy Got Fingered is so awful that it turns the likes of Battlefield Earth and 3000 Miles to Graceland into pretenders to the label of a bad movie. It makes American Pie appear like a representation of high brow comedy and fools us into thinking that Pink Flamingos is a bastion of good taste. Most depressing of all as I was sitting through Freddy Got Fingered the idea occurred to me that it might be preferable to sneak into the theater next door to watch Josie and the Pussycats a second time. Is there a plot? I suppose although its just a flimsy excuse to allow writer/director/star Tom Green to spend time mugging for the camera and doing his X-rated comedy sketches. Green plays Gord Brody a loser who goes to Hollywood to become a star cartoonist. When things dont work out he moves back in with his Dad (Rip Torn - whose reputation gets both ripped and torn) and Mom (Julie Hagerty) but a running feud develops between him and dear old Dad. Meanwhile Gord gets a girlfriend Betty (Marisa Coughlan in a career-killing performance) whos confined to a wheelchair and is obsessed with performing oral sex on him. In the end everything turns out all right - especially for those who have long since escaped the theater to do something better with their time. I dont understand Tom Greens appeal nor do I comprehend who comprises his target demographic. Infants? (The silly expressions and incessant repetition of words would go over well with them.) Teenage boys? Drew Barrymore? People who are drunk stoned or both? Maybe the criteria is that you need to be two of the above. There is nothing here about Green that I find funny (although I liked him in Road Trip). Maybe its that he tries too hard for laughs or that his few potentially funny bits are far too obvious. As I said comedy is subjective and watching this guy do his shtick makes me feel like Im being subjected to some form of inhuman torture. Hes the most irritating and repugnant thing to come from MTV since Pauly Shore. Check that... Shore never made anything as bad as Freddy Got Fingered. In fact Ed Wood never made something this unwatchable. In his attempts to introduce movie-goers to things they have never before viewed inside the hallowed halls of the local multiplex Green gives us some cinematic moments that seem destined to become classics. For example theres the time he parks his car by the side of the road for no apparent reason then runs over to a nearby horse and masturbates it. Or later when he does the same thing to an elephant so he can use its ejaculation as a weapon. Or when he licks the exposed bone in his friends leg injury. There is also a running joke about child molestation and a young kid who is constantly being knocked down hit in the face or smashed in the head (with the result usually being copious amounts of blood). It has been said (and rightfully so) that any topic can be the fodder for humor as long as the treatment is funny. However just because something is shocking and offensive doesnt make it worthy of laughter. No none involved with Freddy Got Fingered learned that lesson. The screenplay has an obvious love of the word ""fuck."" It is used in all of its permutations noun verb adjective adverb. I think every actor (except perhaps Julie Hagerty) has to say it more than once. Those intrigued by the versatility of the word may want to investigate this film (theres no other reason to do so). On one occasion the picture actually puts it to good use. About five minutes before the end credits during a crowd scene one extra holds up a placard reading ""When the fuck is this movie going to end?"" Its something Im sure just about every audience member was wondering. The answer about two hours too late. At any length Freddy Got Fingered would be too long. Im just sorry theres nothing nasty enough that I can write in this review to suitably repay everyone involved in the ruination of 90 minutes of my life. I have gotten better entertainment value from a colonoscopy.
