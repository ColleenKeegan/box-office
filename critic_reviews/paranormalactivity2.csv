E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Paranormal Activity 2 has to hold some kind of a record Its a sequel a prequel and a remake all in one. The movie follows 2009s ""Paranormal Activity the bloodless no-budget ghost story that grossed more than 100 million but the plot of ""2 leads up to and over-explains the events of the first film. The producers being no fools the new movies also a virtual carbon copy of the original in structure feel and carefully doled-out camcorder jolts.Again theres a generic suburban home with generic suburban people living in it Married Dan (Brian Boland) and Kristi (Sprague Grayden) Dans teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) and the couples 1-year-old son Hunter. Kristi turns out to be the sister of the first films Katie (Katie Featherston) not yet in possession of the technology that will destroy her life.Again the gimmick is that everything we see comes from a ""real video source primarily the home surveillance cameras that Dan installs around the house after things start getting weird. (The comparatively upscale visuals must be where the sequels 2.7 million budget went. That and the catering.)And again things go bump and eventually yarrrragghhh in the night. The basic notions that made ""Paranormal Activity work remain solid that were all spooked by midnight noises that our need to record every aspect of our lives means we may see things were not meant to and that theres nothing scarier than a baby being silently dragged across his crib by an invisible demon at 3 in the morning.Yet predictability has set in too. The visual grammar of the scenes is unvarying a wide shot of banal domestic non-action pause pause and then BOO. Rinse repeat. Only a few sequences stick to the ribs one involving kitchen cupboards the other an extremely reluctant trip by Kristi to the basement.""Paranormal Activity 2 cooks along eerily enough until the screenplay starts giving us background information and character motivation and other things a campfire horror tale doesnt need. But campfire tales arent interested in establishing a franchise and ""P.A. 2 labors mightily in that direction.One serious drawback to a movie so reliant on silence It gives an opening to every self-styled comedian in the audience to talk back to the screen. Theres one in every crowd; the night I saw ""Paranormal Activity 2 there were at least three each a legend in his own mind and a pox upon his neighbors. But maybe thats how the new rules of entertainment work Fake realitys up on the screen; the real shows down in the seats.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

Comments click to enlarge Paranormal Activity 2 Video Rated R  91 minutes  2010 The low-budget horror hit Paranormal Activity achieved something of an aesthetic feat by dramatically dialing down the level of action and volume commonly employed in a commercial horror movie to make people jump; its mock-surveillance-camera narrative about a California couple being stalked around their home by an unseen demon was so incredibly dull most of the time that when a door flew open by itself it had the power to shock. Operating on the same principle Paranormal Activity 2 is a prequel to the first film with six home-security cameras (abetted by a lot of unlikely camcorder stuff) recording another family as they wrestle with weird occurrences around their big home and a character from the first movie (Katie Featherston) turns up as an ominous house guest. Like Oren Peli who created the first film director Tod Williams keeps the dialogue So-Cal dumb and colorless which must be part of the scare plan but makes both these movies hard to sit through.

"The subtle scares continue in Paranormal Activity 2. Slate Sign In Sign Up The subtle scares continue in Paranormal Activity 2. The subtle scares continue in Paranormal Activity 2. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 22 2010 334 PM Something Wicked Messed With Our Frying Pan The subtle scares continue in Paranormal Activity 2. By Dana Stevens A scene from Paranormal Activity 2. Last year Oren Pelis debut feature Paranormal Activity exemplified an emerging trend that I dubbed ""artisanal horror."" Shot on digital video in Pelis own home the film was a low-key little slice of demon-possession verite which used the same found-footage conceit as The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield A young California couple Katie and Micah (Katie Featherston  and Micah Sloat) troubled by weird noises in their house set up a video camera to record their bedroom as they sleep and the footage reveals that indeed some evil force seems to have set its sights on Katie. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The most surprising thing about Paranormal Activity was how many people wanted to see it despite the lack of gore or spectacular special effects. Pelis scare tactics were minimalist to the point of austerity He got enormous mileage out of the image of a dark room with two people asleep in a bed the timecode in the corner of the screen clicking inexorably toward the next unexplainable event. Most horror movies use everyday banality--the sound of dishes clanking the breakfast discussion about what happened last night--as a momentary counterpoint a backdrop against which a monster can pop out. Paranormal Activity and now its sequel Paranormal Activity 2 (Paramount) turn everyday banality into the monster--these movies make an empty suburban room as scary as any torture-porn abattoir. Advertisement For fans of old-school horror there was also something heartening about the success of a movie as conceptually simple and quietly creepy as the first Paranormal Activity. Surely the sequel--directed this time not by Peli but by Tod Williams who wrote and directed the haunting Jeff Bridges vehicle The Door in the Floor--would betray the spirit of the original eliminating the shuddery longueurs in the name of scream-per-minute efficiency? Not really. Paranormal Activity 2 is similar to its predecessor in pacing and tone--if anything a little too similar with events ramping up at a gradual but merciless rate that anyone whos seen the original will recognize. Still even knowing whats likely to come--the doors opening on their own the skeptical characters scoffing at metaphysical explanations the unheeded warnings from paranormally gifted guests--doesnt make it any less nailbiting to watch. Paranormal Activity 2 is for its first 90 minutes at least a prequel that takes place in the two months preceding the events of the first film (a five-minute coda functions as a bridge connecting the two plotlines). The couple of the first film Katie and Micah are marginal (if important) players in this story; the things that go bump in the night are all in the house belonging to Katies sister Christine (Sprague Grayden) her husband Daniel (Brian Boland) and their two children a teenage daughter and a newborn son. Soon after the baby comes home from the hospital the familys house is broken into and trashed though not burglarized. Security experts advise setting up cameras in each room to film the house 24/7 (as with many of these ""found-footage"" movies the verisimilitude is iffy here but what the hell its a genre convention). For many nights in a row nothing scarier happens than a frying pan falling off its hook or the self-powered swimming-pool cleaner mysteriously ending up outside the pool every morning. But the babysitter Martine (Vivis) who unlike the family is deeply religious senses that something evil is afoot. (Some critics have found this character to be a ""magical Latina"" stereotype but I wasnt bothered by Martine; like the white psychic who visits the house in the first movie shes presented as someone whos more attuned to reality than the naive complacent protagonists.) The explicit goals of the malevolent being or beings who stalk the house are almost never made plain which as was the case with the first installment ends up being one of this movies strengths. Why would a demon this powerful dick around with frying pans and swimming-pool cleaners for weeks on end rather than just sweeping in and killing whomever it wanted to kill? For the same reason this movie takes its own sweet silent time Because its less interested in making sense than in scaring the pants off you.

"Paranormal Activity 2 Same vibe still scary - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Paranormal Activity 2 Same vibe still scaryParanormal Activity 2 3 starsOctober 22 2010|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticDemons of mediocrity be gone Here we have a shrewd sequel a touch better than the original. Set two months prior to the San Diego County hauntings of ""Paranormal Activity"" ""Paranormal Activity 2"" gives low-budget honor and modest gore-free but nerve-wracking glory to ghost stories sequels prequels and the dark Hollywood art of the cash-in. In crucial ways the second film is a lot like the first which was released commercially last year (a slightly different version of Oren Pelis picture was completed in 2007). The conceit remains the same. Were watching home video and surveillance footage throughout confined to the house and grounds of a pleasantly generic-looking two-story Carlsbad Calif. home. In the original young cohabitators Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) installed a camera in their bedroom to record strange doings while they slept. Not much happened and then gradually just enough happened to put the whammy on the audience. Pelis film wasnt ""about"" anything (nor is the new one). Its brand of fright wasnt psychological or nuanced. It was however stealthy patient and devoid of the customary 21st century viscera. For teenagers benumbed by the explicitness of the ""Saw"" and ""Hostel"" franchises Pelis monster success provided an antidote a taste of something designed to spook them without assault. All of which is true in ""2."" Director Tod Williams cannily expands the visual scope of the original without violating its found-footage aesthetic (hardly a fresh idea but effective in the right hands). The focus in this prequel is on Katies sister Kristi ( Sprague Grayden) who returns home from the hospital with newborn Hunter. Katie comes by early and often. The sisters have experienced hauntings in their childhood dismissed as hokum by Kristis jocular husband (Brian Boland). Theres also a maid (Vivis) who senses evil spirits; a dog Abby rightly protective of the infant; and a teenage daughter (Molly Ephraim) from the fathers previous marriage. Instead of one fixed surveillance camera we get six each stationed in different rooms installed by the family after their house apparently is burglarized. The script by Michael R. Perry Christopher Landon and Tom Pabst with story help from producer Peli improves on the original in its depiction of the central couple. (The bickering in the first film put the audience squarely on the side of the unseen demon.) Here the banters looser more relaxed. But the pacing remains methodical so that when the kitchen cupboards and drawers suddenly fly open in union (a ""Close Encounters"" moment for sure) its pretty arresting. There are quibbles to be had. The movie doesnt get the ending it needs (unlike the first one which had help from an advisor named Spielberg). ""Paranormal Activity 2"" like its predecessor doesnt advance the genre so much as strip it for parts. But Im a fan. I like the restraint. The time-worn lessons apply. Those skeptical of the supernatural are doomed to suffer. And somehow even after all these home-movie movies where the narcissists on screen are intent on videotaping every single moment of their lives the sight of a dog or a baby watching something the idiot with the camera cannot see...well Im scared just thinking about it. MPAA rating R (for some language and brief violent material) Cast Katie Featherston (Katie); Sprague Grayden (Kristi); Brian Boland (Daniel); Molly Ephraim (Ali); Micah Sloat (Micah) Credits Directed by Tod Williams; written by Michael R. Perry Christopher Landon and Tom Pabst; produced by Jason Blum and Oren Peli. A Paramount Pictures release. Running time 131.

Paranormal Activity 2 Director Tod Williams. Cast Brian Boland Sprague Grayden Molly Ephraim. Rating Rated R for some language and brief violent material. But it does deliver. The follow-up to last years sleeper hit which became a word-of-mouth phenomenon - and eventually the most successful movie in terms of cost to profit ever - has even more scares than the first film. Whats unusual about these movies is that we know those scares are coming and the filmmakers drawn-out approach makes them even more effective when they finally arrive. Director Tod Williams takes over for Oren Peli who created the original and has more to work with both in terms of budget (the original cost only 15000 to make) and point of view. In addition to the now-ubiquitous hand-held camera wielded early on by Daniel (Brian Boland) and sometimes his teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) theres also a multi-camera high-tech security system serving as witness to the strange goings-on. That comes courtesy of what the family thinks is a break-in though nothing is taken. Ali Daniel and his wife Kristi (Sprague Grayden) live in a nice home in Carlsbad Calif. with their baby son Hunter (Ali is Daniels daughter from a previous marriage). Much of the movie is a prequel as we learn when Kristis sister Katie (Katie Featherson) and her boyfriend Micah (Micah Sloat) show up for visits. There are references to childhood incidents that were too unpleasant to rehash which call to mind Katies allusions to something similar in the first movie. And once again things start going bump in the night. A lot. Daniel is a skeptic of the first order but Kristi is increasingly creeped out. Ali thinks its cool at least at first until she figures out that whatever is happening here likely isnt the work of a friendly ghost. Pots and pans fall a mobile above Hunters crib spins and in a nice touch the pool vacuum which serves as a sort of nightly reference point seems to have a mind of its own. All creepy yes but what ratchets up the tension is the presence of Hunter and the family dog a German Shepherd who often sleeps in Hunters room. Its clear to them from the start that somethings going on in the house but they have no way of communicating that knowledge beyond a cry or a bark. The blue-and-white nighttime scenes in Hunters room are unnerving. Hunter and the dog sense danger before anyone else does - and they also serve to warn us that something is amiss as well. But when they sound that warning it doesnt undercut the sense of fear and dread we feel. It increases it. More so than with most horror movies ""Paranormal Activity 2"" and its predecessor make us practically beg for something scary to happen. Its a combination of the pacing and our awareness of what were watching and how we are meant to watch it. As a static camera displays an empty kitchen hallway or living room we search every corner of the screen high and low for shadows flickering light a wind-blown curtain anything that might give us a clue as to whats going on even as were afraid to find out. This makes us much more active participants and makes watching ""Paranormal Activity 2"" - and being scared by it - a lot more fun. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

When inexplicable little tremors begin in the house the Hispanic help (who seemingly has seminary training) promptly diagnoses demons but everyone else needs to see with their own eyes--which are everywhere as narrative information is filtered through a six-camera home surveillance circuit and ever-ready camcorders. Where The Last Exorcism was sustained by artfully balanced skepticism and a feel for character Paranormal 2 putatively directed by Tod Williams can only hold an audience with the understood promise of big jolts around the corner--and they come as Hunter becomes the hunted (Sorry.) A nullity of a ghost story whose idea of creating atmosphere is preparing a blank surface for soundtrack bumps-in-the-night to resound off.

Certainly there were lumps in the bed a girl named Katie (Katie Featherstone) and a guy named Micah (Micah Sloat) who ended up dead (which wasnt that bothersome an outcome because he was such a dope). What I remembered enjoying was the feeling of camaraderie with the rest of the audience derived from the shared experience of being simultaneously spooked. The fear the movie generated dissipated almost immediately upon exiting the theater leaving not the stuff nightmares are made of but rather the sense that I had just had some warm giggly fun with my fellow man. This was noteworthy because customarily Im the person giving my fellow man dirty looks for talking peeking at his phone or rattling the plastic bag hes wrapped around a smelly burrito. So I had my doubts about Paramounts blatant attempt to create a franchise out of a minimalist original (remember the unintentional horror show that was Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2) especially since a new director (Tod Williams) was replacing the original writer-director Oren Peli. But I was looking forward to another shared experience. It didnt matter to me what demon was in which house. Yet it was pleasing and satisfying to discover that Paranormal Activity 2 is not a reboot of the first film but in fact more of a prequel; the two movies are so closely connected that the second provides the backstory for the first plus a coda. (See the All-TIME top 25 horror movies.) The movie opens with a charming thank-you to the police of Carlsbad Calif. and the families of the deceased then proceeds right to home video. A newborn baby boy is brought home from the hospital by his mother Kristi (the sprightly Sprague Grayden of 24) and proud papa Daniel (Brian Boland). In short order baby Hunter is introduced to his nanny Martine (Vivis) his teenage half sister Ali (Molly Ephraim) and his nice aunt Katie. Wait -- Katie? If youve seen the first movie (and if youve not spoiler alert) youll recall the last time we saw her she was possessed by a demon and covered with her boyfriend Micahs blood. But thats all in the future here and much of the fun of the movie comes from anticipating how the new story and the old one will intersect. Sisters do talk after all. Peli wrote and directed the original on the kind of budget that might get you a pretty great used car. Its safe to assume Williams (The Door in the Floor) had a bit more than 11000 to play with. But there arent any radical shifts stylistically. Once again we watch a lot of time-coded surveillance footage looking for ominous shifts in small objects and doors that swing open and shut on their own. The main difference is that disturbing things happen in the night and the daytime at this house. Around the time Hunter reaches an age to be toddling adorably around Kristi and Daniels home usually under the watchful eye of the family dog Abby theres a break-in. Nothing is taken but the place is ransacked and Daniel decides to put hidden security cameras in a few choice spots including by the pool and in the front entryway the family room the kitchen and wisely Hunters room. Beginning with an August day in 2006 we are shown the same series of images from the surveillance cameras. Not much happens at first except that the dog possessed of a keen sense for the paranormal rarely gets a good nights sleep. Nor does the baby who has a habit of looking off into corners when his mother is with him as if maybe he sees something she doesnt. (Read Richard Corliss review of the original Paranormal Activity.) Unlike the original Paranormal Activity 2s pacing is uneven; it builds slowly and effectively before rushing too quickly and at one point not particularly coherently through the climax. But the jolts when they come are bigger causing actual physical thrills and chills at least for me. There wasnt that same intense shared mood in the audience though; it was as if the bloom were slightly off the paranormal rose. That might be because some of the answers the film provides are too facile; Ali in particular proves a suspiciously able researcher. The connections between the two films are plausible (as much as can be expected when dealing with the paranormal) but might be bothersome to those who prefer their horror of a more vague and mysterious nature. Or it might just be that like fickle midterm-election voters the audience demands a kind of freshness that isnt possible in a follow-up. Sure they liked the first film last year but how about some change? For my part I doubt Ill forget what Katie did this time. And Id probably sit through whatever she does next as well.

"Paranormal Activity 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; paranormal-activity-2 ) Paranormal Activity 2 (United States 2010) October 23 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Regardless of how it performs at the box office this much is clear Paranormal Activity 2 is a mistake. The clumsy and obvious byproduct of the financial success of its predecessor last Halloween this movie has no reason for existing except to provide Paramount Pictures with a few extra shekels. Although its release does not represent an outright insult akin to the one offered by The Blair Witch Project 2 its superfluous nature not only ranks this as a waste of time but diminishes the original. The story functions primarily as a prequel with most of the events chronicled in this 90-minute voyeuristic extravaganza transpiring between one and two months before those depicted in Paranormal Activity. Instead of focusing on a couple this time the roster of characters has expanded. Kristi (Sprague Grayden) is the sister of the first films Katie (Katie Featherstone) who makes occasional appearances throughout Paranormal Activity 2 along with her soon-to-be-dead lover Micah (Micah Sloat). Kristi is happily married to Dan (Brian Boland) who tied the knot with her some time after the death of his first wife. He has a teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) from his first marriage. In addition the happy couple has a new baby boy Hunter whos a little over a year old. He spends most of his time standing in his crib staring at things only he can see. We keep expecting him to say ""Theyre here"" As in the first movie the basic plot relates to the characters being stalked by a demon within their home and how seemingly innocuous bumps in the night gradually take an alarming turn. The stylistic choice by which everything happens in front of a video camera is carried over although in this installment home security cameras provide a majority of the footage (supplemented by camcorder images). This at least eliminates the silly contrivance of someone always having to be running a camera even during the most unlikely of circumstances. By establishing this as a prequel the protagonists from Paranormal Activity are provided with an opportunity for supporting roles. Toward the end the time frame of Paranormal Activity 2 moves beyond that of its predecessor allowing us a ""what happens next"" glimpse. The door is left open for a Paranormal Activity 3 which will undoubtedly be produced if theres profitability in making it. While the first Paranormal Activity did an excellent job of incrementally advancing the creepiness factor with every scene and generating an ominous atmosphere as the familiar surroundings of a home became hostile those qualities are not evident here. In Paranormal Activity 2 events follow a blueprint. Its a series of ""boo"" moments connected by exposition so uninvolving that we find ourselves impatiently waiting for the next loud crash or bang. There are plenty of opportunities for startlement but nothing approaches terror. Paranormal Activity is never frightening. In fact considering how long it takes before the ""paranormal"" events begin occurring its on the dull side. Worse the final ten minutes - the sequence in which the films converge - comes dangerously close to self-parody. (There were people laughing at the screening I attended and laughter is not the intended reaction.) The acting is better for this installment but thats due to the employment of professional actors. Using familiar faces in a production like this can be a double-edged sword. For example although Sprague Grayden is hardly a household name her face may appear frustratingly familiar to some viewers. A quick perusal of her resume indicates that she has done a lot of television including a lengthy stint on 24. When a movie is attempting to ""fake"" viewers into believing that what theyre watching is real its a good idea not to involve actors who may be recognizable since that interferes with the illusion. Tod Williams direction effectively apes Oren Pelis approach to the first film but the added layers of polish allowed by the larger production crew and the higher budget have not aided the sense of verisimilitude. In Paranormal Activity it felt like we were watching two ordinary people filming themselves in the comfort of their own home. Here everything feels artificial from the shots of the pool cleaner going about its business to the scenes of the child standing in his crib. The qualities that made Paranormal Activity compelling have either been diluted or deleted. Whats left is a faint distorted echo of the original. Its passable entertainment for anyone who has not seen the first feature but redundant for anyone who has.

"Paranormal Activity 2 Hey Casper get an afterlife | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesParanormal Activity 2 Hey Casper get an afterlifeMovie critic Peter Howell writes the demon in Paranormal Activity 2 telling it to clean up its act.Paranormal Activity 2 looks like the first but the scares are largely absent.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 22 2010Paranormal Activity 2(out of 4)Starring Katie Featherston Micah Sloat Brian Boland Sprague Grayden and Molly Ephraim. Directed by Tod Williams. At major theatres. 91 minutes. 14AYo Casper MilquetoastListen you little freak whats up with you?Article Continued BelowYoure supposed to be scary. Satans best friend. The Beast incarnate.But youre as frightening as a bedsheet flapping on a clothesline. And youre about as original as a Xerox.Paranormal Activity 2 is roughly 70 minutes of you having late-night hissy fits followed by 21 minutes where you finally grow a pair and really start the demonic stuff.This is basically what you did in the first Paranormal Activity which was way scarier simply because it was much more of a novelty. You did stuff like lighting fires in the first film. Now youre messing with swimming pools and kitchen utensils.I know that the people youre haunting this time -- Daniel (Brian Boland) Kristi (Sprague Grayden) teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) and toddler Hunter -- are annoying California Yuppies. But seriously Casper why take out your aggression on their swimming pools cleaning robot? Thats just lame dude.And flinging around pots and pans and other kitchen utensils is something Id expect to see in a TV sitcom not a horror movie.If Freddy Krueger saw you in action hed laugh his melted head off. Then hed slice you up and kick you down the basement stairs.You know the black birds you keep slamming into the walls to give them a fright? Two words Alfred Hitchcock.Also if youre going to scratch something into a door it should say something. Not just gibberish like you do in the movie but something scary. Like ""Go to hell"" or ""Vote Rob Ford""Be original Casper for crying out loud. But I cant entirely blame you. Director Tod Williams screenwriter Michael R. Perry and the gang at Paramount Pictures know they have some profitable shtick here and they werent about to change things. Same ShakyCam same fake found-footage premise.Although I do like how they worked in Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat from the first film making Paranormal Activity 2 both a prequel and a sequel.Listen Casper my main beef with you concerns your targets of harassment. Couldnt you find somebody more deserving of your rage?Arrogant Daniel is the only pain in this picture and you pretty much leave him alone. Instead you terrify a new mom her darling baby boy and her innocent stepdaughter.Oh and you also knock around the family pooch who is so sweet she rarely barks.Why take it out on these guys?Really Casper a baby?Oh I know you have some grudge that goes back a few generations.But just because some crazy great-grandmother reneged on a promise to turn her first-born son over to you doesnt mean you have to take it out on her distant progeny.Boo frickin hoo Casper.Either get over it or pick on somebody your own size. Although judging by how low-down those door scratches are your own size should put you in the casting call as a Munchkin for a Wizard of Oz remake.You know whats really sad Casper?The biggest jump in Paranormal Activity 2 comes when someone screams over an awesomely plugged toilet. That horrific mess was caused by a human not by you.Get it together Casper or the next chapter of this franchise will have to be called Paranormal Inactivity because youll be putting people to sleep.Now thats got to scare the hell out of you.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

So why is there a grade of ""B+""? Because both movies straightforward not-a-whiff-of-pretense goal is simply to scare the bedoodle out of the audience and PA2 succeeds in that just as well if not better than the first. Both these movies should have a BSO rating - Bring Significant Other - because terrified clutching will occur. The nice man sitting next to me didnt know me before the movie but he certainly did by the time it was over. He probably had some fingernail marks in his arm to prove it. Thanks for being a good sport Mr. NorthPark Screening Gentleman.For those who havent seen the first PA this would be a good time to avert your eyes go watch it and come back later. PA2 has exactly the same premise as its predecessor young couple (though in this case its a second marriage and the husband is a bit older) haunted house creaky doors unseen attacker dragging wife hither and yon.The filmmakers up the ante here with the addition of a smart teenage girl an adorable toddler and a protective (but freaked-out) German shepherd named Abby. Katie and Micah the victimized couple from the first film also show up but thats all Im going to reveal about them.The script by Oren Peli (characters; he wrote and directed the first film) and Michael R. Perry (screenplay) plays into the same primal fears that PA1 exploited with such wicked fervor ghosts demons total lack of control possessed automatic pool cleaners (OK thats a new one and its depicted in a way thats both creepy and hilarious). PA2 also beautifully ties into the first movie with juicy details that explain a lot but also leave things wide open for PA3.Go ahead Tell yourself its just the sound and light guys wreaking all that havoc. Tell yourself thats stage blood and that baby is never in any real danger. Tell yourself that seeing that dogs hackles go up while it stares intently at nothing is just the result of a great offstage trainer. But also tell yourself this Take someone to grab.R (some language and brief violent material). Director Tod Williams.

TWITTER Less a sequel than a superfluous remake aParanormal Activity 2a takes everything that was unique about the original and simply tries to do it again. Technically accomplished in its fake video-verite style but artistically bankrupt the film -- judging by the derisive jeers that erupted during the end credits at an opening-day screening -- is not likely to incite the passionate fervor generated by its predecessor. Being billed as a prequel Paranormal Activity 2 reprises one of the characters and the exact formula of the original. Again the point of view is strictly through home video and surveillance-camera footage that eventually reveals the bumps in the night threatening the hapless characters. The action takes place in the sprawling well-appointed suburban California home of Daniel (Brian Boland); wife Kristi (Sprague Grayden) who is the sister of the originals Katie (Katie Featherston); teen daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim); and toddler son Hunter. After a seemingly random break-in a series of surveillance cameras is installed at various locations in and outside the house. For a long stretch were treated to banal footage of the family going about its day-to-day existence until you guessed it mysterious things start happening. They are at first seemingly minor A frying pan falls off of a pot rack; the automatic pool cleaner seems to have a mind of its own; and the familys German shepherd starts barking for no apparent reason. Director Tod Williams manages to effectively ratchet up the tension as the horrific events escalate with long static takes that keep the audience on edge until the inevitable loud noises and sudden shocks induce the predictable responses. But anyone who has seen the original knows exactly where things are heading with the result that the proceedings seem far more manipulative than unnerving. Although the original characters were appealing and sympathetic in their mounting terror the banal figures here fail to hold our interest though the tyke and the canine have their moments. Like the original -- or at least the version that was theatrically released -- the story reaches a jarring conclusion involving demonic possession thats more designed for shock value than in keeping with the relatively subtle menace preceding it.

"Movie review Paranormal Activity 2 - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review Paranormal Activity 2With a bigger cast and more voyeuristic stakeouts the sequel fine-tunes the shivers that made the first movie a hit.October 23 2010|By Robert Abele Special to the Los Angeles Times Just when you thought it was safe to auto-record your McMansion existence along comes ""Paranormal Activity 2"" to make static video grays a corner time stamp and well-placed bumps in the night further cause for audience nervousness.Its the sequel to last years DIY horror hit ""Paranormal Activity"" a housebound creeper built on some marginal if appreciatively unslick and non-gory jitters. In true indie-explosion fashion writer-director Oren Pelis 11000 feature went from midnight-screening word-of-mouth to 100-million hit upon release from Paramount (which had the good sense not to stick logos and credits on what was intended to play like found footage of a ghost capture gone wrong).Any lingering questions however as to whether the follow-up represents a ""Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2"" scenario a in other words what gives real shivers to Hollywood killing a franchise with one bad sequel a can be easily laid to rest. This ""Paranormal"" set once again in a roomy two-story suburban house is more of the same for all the good and acceptably routine that that implies.First off there are more characters in this case a Carlsbad Calif. family composed of a dad (Brian Boland) second wife (Sprague Grayden) perky teen daughter from the first marriage boy toddler Latina nanny who senses bad spirits and German shepherd (whose alertness to things unseen is one of the movies new goose-bump-raising assets).There are also more visual perspectives from the hand-held camcorder that various family members use to document initially happy a then increasingly worrisome a household events to the six security cameras installed in the wake of an unexplainable burglary. Katie (Katie Featherston) is back too as the sister of this movies young mom. If that sounds odd considering how the first film ended this ones narrative is craftily arranged around its precursors timeline and on that front thats all the plot youre getting here.Then again family drama isnt what the ""Paranormal"" films are about and in fact when talk of demons and motives and history crops up it feels like filler between the real meat voyeuristic stakeouts that amount to showdowns with moviegoers nerves. Also the new scenarios sextet of security-cam coverage a the front of the house the pool the kitchen the living room the stairs and finally (gulp) the babys room a allows for cross-cutting tension a tool that director Tod Williams (""The Door in the Floor"") taking over for Peli employs well. Which means one might have to sit through plenty of successive shots of grainy wide-angle stillness but when the jolting thud or a frisson of movement comes it can only feel like a warning shot straight from hell.That ""Paranormal Activity 2"" mostly eschews the whiff of cashing in or looking like a low-budget finds more-moneyed cousin is a victory of sorts. Call it a case of skilled sameness of something fine-tuned rather than overplayed. As any patient malevolent spirit would tell you if it aint broke break it at just the right moment.Works every time.calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESReview Paranormal Activity 4 an eerie setup for another...October 18 2012Movie Projector Paranormal Activity 3 to frighten rivalsOctober 20 2011Summer box-office hits help Hollywood stop hemorrhagingAugust 27 2011Paranormal Activity Somewhere Hitchcock is smilingOctober 3 2009MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentParanormal ActivityCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-paranormal-activity-20101023,0,867086.story",200,paranormalactivity213,paranormalactivity2,latimes
"Review Paranormal Activity 2 is a fright - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon LinkedIn Review Paranormal Activity 2 is a fright By Tom Charity Special to CNN ""Paranormal Activity 2"" is bigger than the original but is it better? STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe original ""Paranormal Activity"" was made for a small budget and grossed 100 millionThe sequel involves a larger family in a bigger house grappling with an evil spiritReviewer says ""Paranormal Activity 2"" offers some scary moments RELATED TOPICS Movies Horror Movies Entertainment (CNN) -- Horror may be the most democratic film genre -- or at least the only genre where ""cheap and nasty"" can be considered a compliment. Many seminal horror flicks were made on not much more than a shoestring. Recently Oren Pelis fiendish ""Paranormal Activity"" joined that list. Like ""The Blair Witch Project"" (and ""Cloverfield"") the film presented itself as ""found footage."" The movie was presented as a home movie much of it shot on remote control a locked camera in the dead of night as a young couple endured unwelcome visits from a demon that never showed its face but nestled in the creak of a door the tug of a bedsheet and finally the possession of a soul. Peli didnt need a million dollars to make a scary movie but he needed a Hollywood deal to get his film seen. It took nearly two years to reach the multiplexes and the movie then went on to make 100 million. He has a producer credit on the sequel but his involvement seems to have been nominal. The script is by TV veteran Michael Perry and Tod Williams (""The Door in the Floor"") directs. So how do you make a big-budget sequel to a film set entirely within a single house a film that worked through suggestion and repetition? With more suggestion more repetition and were gonna need a bigger house thats how. Weve definitely moved up an income bracket. The household is bigger too This couple has a teenage daughter (from a previous mom) a new baby a live-in maid and a guard dog. Plus the same evil spirit as before. iReporter movie review I give it a B The introduction of the baby is an inspired -- if deeply cynical -- ploy. If theres one thing more frightening than watching vulnerable young women being terrorized its seeing a preverbal infant trying to let Mommy know theres something scary hiding in the closet. (And its not the blue sasquatch from ""Monsters Inc."") Williams ramps up the surveillance too The family installs half a dozen security cameras throughout the property irritatingly set at tilted angles in the corners of the rooms. It looks more like a reality TV show than the first film but still the strategy is the same Suck us into humdrum suburban banality then slam the door in our faces. Was it a gust of wind or could there be a more sinister force at work? Less patient this time and less controlled but also mindful that most if not all the audience will have been here before the filmmakers cant resist a few superfluous freakouts just for fun. An automatic pool cleaner that gets itself out of the pool is a witty touch but a CGI baby padding upright through the house is funny for the wrong reasons. Even if its never quite as chillingly insidiously real the sequel -- if thats the right word -- intersects with the first film in a pleasingly malevolent fashion that creeps up on you as the time-code ticks by. The hundred million-dollar question of course being is it scary? I swear when Chrissie was attacked by her kitchen cabinets the entire theater jumped 3 inches into the air. There are several big juicy jolts like that one -- more than enough to go round and to generate a possible ""Paranormal Activity 3.""

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet So much attention was given to Paranormal Activitys innovative viral marketing campaign that the movie didnt get enough credit for being shrewd in its own right. Yes the DIY vid-cam aesthetic owed plenty to The Blair Witch Project and imitators like [REC] and could properly be faulted for arriving late to the party but writer-director Oren Peli smartly integrated the reality-TV age where seemingly everyones on-camera with the classic thumps and bumps of a haunted-house movie which are still elementally terrifying. The sequel Paranormal Activity 2 multiplies the cameras and cast members but mostly takes the conservative route repeating and oh-so-slightly amplifying the lo-fi shocks that audiences liked (or could be convinced to see anyway) in the original. As much as the franchise borrows from Blair Witch the filmmakers clearly learned a different kind of lesson from Blair Witch 2. A prequel of sorts Paranormal Activity 2 brings back Katie Featherston and Micah Sloat and resets the timeline to two months before their dread-soaked haunting. But theyre mostly relegated to the periphery as Featherstons sister (Sprague Grayden) and her family--including a skeptical husband (Brian Boland) a teenage step-daughter (Molly Ephraim) and a toddler--are tormented by a demon spirit. On top of the extensive camcorder-ing that goes on in the household a camera gimmick similar to the one in Paranormal Activity is justified by a home invasion where the place is ransacked but nothing goes missing. Fitted with surveillance cameras in the bedrooms living room kitchen and both exterior sides the family is now ready for the escalation of terrors theyre about to face. Director Tod Williams the frightmaster behind the John Irving adaptation The Door In The Floor doesnt mess with success adding just a few bigger scares to a formula thats virtually the same. And that formula still works especially in the sickening procession of nights--each documented with dates and timestamps--that keep getting worse as they march along. Paranormal Activity 2 stretches itself perilously thin and seems intent on stretching its tacked-on mythology with intimations of a second sequel. But what was scary once is scary twice like a carnival funhouse remodeled with a few new mirrors and spring-loaded spooks.

(Paramount/AP) A scene from Paranormal Activity.(Paramount/AP) Movie review Paranormal Activity 2 Deja boo Add to ... Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 22 2010 343AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The first Paranormal Activity released in 2009 introduced a breath of fresh scare into the horror genre. Generating suspense from a stationary home security camera with a time-code on the image it reversed the shaky-cam style of The Blair Witch Project while capturing the same suspense from unseen terrors. The young couple featured in that first film Katie and Micah (Katy Edwards and Micah Sloane) are back for Paranormal 2 though this time on the sidelines for a family-in-peril story. The focus is on Katies perky sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) her middle-aging husband Daniel (Brian Boland) and his teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) from a previous marriage. Raising the fear stakes the film adds a dog and a cute toddler to the list of the vulnerable. Horror film convention demands that evil just needs one moral crack in a character to leap in. In the first Paranormal Activity the badness seems to have been awakened by Micahs fondness for ogling Katies chest through his video camera. In the new movie the father Daniel is guilty of excessive house pride. When his new eighties-style McMansion is apparently trashed by vandals he invests in a set of security cameras around the home. That compels the audience to watch most of the rest of the movie from a half-dozen fixed camera positions staring down into the big pretentious home Daniels ""man cave"" study and 50-inch TV the ceiling pan rack the stable-sized double front doors mirrored bedroom closet doors. Its hard to say whether its more in need of an exorcist or a visit from the Extreme Make-Over Home Edition team. Director Tod Williams trained in more cerebral fare ( The Door in the Floor The Adventures of Sebastian Cole) is a believer in the very slow build. On about Night 12 theres finally a big bang. A few nights later a pan falls from the ceiling rack sending Kristi into paroxysms of terror. Some nights after that the double doors lock the teenaged Ali out of the house. The principle suspense is wondering when the suspense is going to start as you scan the darkly-lit screen looking for any hint of imminent horror. Sure there are a couple of mildly hair-raising moments the toddler Hunter seems to sharing the room with an invisible friend or when Abby the German shepherd twitches as if hallucinating a squirrel. When the action sharply intensifies in the movies last 15 minutes theres one strong scene shot in greenish blur from a night vision video-camera. Otherwise the best sequences are too familiar from the first movie leaving a disappointing sense of deja boo. Paranormal Activity 2 Directed by Tod Williams Written by Michael R.

Nevertheless its opening a week before Halloween (and ""Saw 3D"") sans serious genre competition should scare up robust returns for Paramount which wisely stoked anticipation by keeping cast and plot details top-secret. Disappointed word of mouth might prompt even steeper post-opening falloff than usual however. The Rey family is introduced moving into their new Southern California home videotaping the occasion for posterity of course. Theres dad Daniel (Brian Boland) mom Kristi (Sprague Grayden) teen Ali (Molly Ephraim) and infant Hunter played by twins William and Jackson Prieto once the action jumps forward a few months to toddlerhood. Theres also Abby the German Shepherd and Martine (Vivis) the new nanny/housekeeper. (Its a puzzle why the Reys hire someone who doesnt speak English when they dont really understand Spanish.) Naturally Mans Best Friend and Superstitious Ethnic Type are the first to perceive something amiss in the household. But even before that the family comes home one day to find the place trashed -- yet theres no sign of forced entry and nothings been stolen. Surveillance cameras are then installed both inside and outside to catch whatever pranksters might be spooking this upscale suburban hood. Meanwhile everyday life goes on including visits from Kristis sister Katie (Katie Featherston) and her b.f. Micah (Micah Sloat) whom viewers will recall as the protagonists in writer-director Oren Pelis sleeper-smash original. When Martine baby-sits Hunter one night the Reys return to find her frantically cleansing the house of evil spirits via incense and incantation. Soon everybody in the family is getting creeped out what with toys moving of their own accord sudden inexplicable noises etc. The adult sisters admit that in childhood they experienced some similar terrors memories long blotted out. Though more briskly edited than its predecessor ""Paranormal Activity 2"" likewise takes its time springing the first big jolt only after a full hour after which things escalate fast. But nothing here is as unsettling as in the original. Thats partly because viewers now know more or less what to expect but also because the spacious home setting is often too brightly lit to be scary. Plus pics new protags are far less engaging and empathetic than the first films quarreling psychologically deteriorating duo. (Including a dog and a toddler two types whose reactions always fascinate does partly compensate.) Its good to see director Tod Williams (of the very good but underseen prior features ""The Adventures of Sebastian Cole"" and ""The Door in the Floor"") getting a significant commercial assignment even its a somewhat thankless one in creative terms. Hes lashed to a homemovie/surveillance-camera illusion thats a little less convincing and certainly less fresh his time around. But its the screenplay that ultimately demonstrates too little imagination beyond the manner in which it bookends its predecessor. When all (or at least some) hell breaks loose scares reprise those in the first film without topping them; the malevolent force never feels like a real character in the narrative. Like the recent ""The Last Exorcism"" another faux-found-footage scarefest pic doesnt end with a bang so much as peter out. Though many times more expensive than Pelis DIY project (albeit still rock-bottom cheap by major studio standards at a reported production cost of about 3 million) and slicker than it needed to be the sequel stays true to its aesthetic in tech and design terms. An upside At least this so-so effort is just a letdown; its no franchise-killing disaster like ""Book of Shadows Blair Witch 2.""

ABOUT THE MOVIEParanormal Activity 2   (out of four)Stars Sprague Grayden Brian Boland Molly Ephraim Katie Featherston Micah Sloat VivisDirector Tod WilliamsDistributor Paramount PicturesRating R for some language and brief violent material Running time 1 hour 31 minutesOpens nationwide Friday By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Leave it to a preverbal baby and an alert watchdog to figure out theres something creepy going on before the adults do. Rarely is the second film in a horror franchise more frightening than the original but Paranormal Activity 2 has more innocent victims and more scares than its predecessor. Kids and dogs are not only faster on the uptake when it comes to sensing paranormal goings-on but also steal scenes as this diabolical thriller delivers spine-tingling jolts and scream-inducing moments. TRAILER Preview Paranormal Activity 2 The terror builds as unrelentingly as it did in the first film which centered on Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) a twentysomething couple whose house is beset by eerie inexplicable incidents. Both are on hand again but the movie focuses on seemingly supernatural occurrences plaguing Katies sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden) her husband Daniel (Brian Boland) teenage daughter Ali (Molly Ephraim) baby Hunter his nanny Martine (Vivis) and the familys German shepherd Abby. The natural believable performances of all -- even the dog -- make for powerful audience surrogates and along with the mundane setting turn things profoundly unsettling. Baffling and sinister events occur within the normalcy of suburbia. Innocuous objects loom terrifyingly. A babys hanging mobile becomes menacing pots and pans pose threats and a pool filtering system in the well-appointed house near San Diego slithers like a demonic snake. Like its predecessor Paranormal Activity 2 is unabashedly low-tech capitalizing on our innate fear of things that go bump in the night. Its a slightly slicker film than the first with sustained unnerving scenes -- at least until the final 15 minutes which are so rushed they feel like a blur compared with the deliberate pace of the suspense up to that point. Jumbled visuals undermine the fear factor and the conclusion doesnt have the climactic gut-punch it should. Humor is woven throughout thanks in large part to the ever-practical Daniel who pooh-poohs every ghostly explanation. As for the plot this is a prequel leading up to the events in 2009s Paranormal with just a smattering of sequel. Like the first Paranormal an indie hit made for a scant 15000 jerky handheld photography dominates. But this film with a seven-figure budget amplifies the sense of claustrophobia and panic with terrifying sounds -- ominous thudding slamming doors creepily tuneful toys. Fans can be relieved that this is no overhyped Blair Witch 2. And they may never look at an open cabinet door the same way again.

(Paramount Pictures) Joe Neumaier Friday October 22 2010 400 AM Title Paranormal Activity 2 Say this for ""Paranormal Activity 2"" Like its 2009 predecessor -- a word-of-mouth hit midnight movie phenomenon and cost-to-profit the most successful film in history -- it successfully replaces what had been every scary flicks fallback visual trick (the killers POV) with its trademarked caught-on-security-camera jolts.The problem is finding new things to capture. Director Tod Williams taking over for original ""PA"" filmmaker Oren Peli never really zooms in on anything. Without giving anything away much of the excruciatingly teased-out tension here echoes the first movie without upping the ante. Theres the unseen demon mysterious flying dishes and a puckish exploitation of our fear of what goes on while we sleep. But while doors do slam and youll jump in your seat the payoff is less satisfying.Most of ""PA2"" is a prequel showing Kristi (Sprague Grayden) the sister of Katie (Katie Featherston) -- who we saw last year become possessed by a hellion -- as she and husband Daniel (Brian Boland) bring their newborn son home. Dad videotapes everything so theres now that additional reference point though Ali (Molly Ephraim) Daniels preteen daughter from a previous marriage finds the constant filming an irritant.Ah but once the family experiences a break-in and an invisible ghoul starts torturingtheir dog Molly sees how handy a camera can be. Soon Katie shows up with no idea what awaits her.The movies insertion of standard horror beats -- the demon wants the kid the dog growls at nothing -- help with the inevitable tedium that sets in; by the time the blue-tinted footage reaches ""Night 10"" and thats still only halfway to an ending audiences wanting a scare may start resenting constantly being shown an automatic pool filter moving on its own. But thats what counts as variation here a mistake the movie never addresses.Still like ""PA 1"" eagle-eyed audiences watching every corner of the screen are rewarded with spooky ""did-you-see-that?"" moments and the actors are bland on purpose making their dragged-down-the-stairs scenes cathartic as well as creepy. And it was a smart move to double the number of characters (theres also a superstitious housekeeper working in Kristi and Daniels California split-level).But smarts in a movie like ""Paranormal Activity 2"" is ultimately wasted energy. It needed less plot explanation and more cloven hoof prints claw marks and snarky demons overheard on the baby monitor. Well at least the cliffhanger ending shows that phantom knows best.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

(Theres a break-in and the house got trashed but?nothing was stolen.) To protect themselves the family sets up a hidden-camera video-surveillance system and this allows the film to cut back and forth among half a dozen fixed-angle views of the house each one coming at you in granular streaming video. (The shots are in color during the daytime and dank fluorescent monochrome at night.) The images all point down which is subtly disquieting and each one is composed with enough wide-angle space and distance and enough nooks and crannies so that even when nothing is happening the often dead-silent shots tend to grow scarier the more you look at them. Theres an image of the front walkway; one of the swimming pool (where a mechanical bottom-trawling pool cleaner keeps teasing us to think that it may be a poltergeist); a kitchen-eye view of the living room; a living-room-eye view of the kitchen; a shot of the entrance foyer and shag-carpet stairway; and finally the nursery where a toddler named Hunter becomes a particular object of fascination -- for us and for the spirit who may be on hand. In Paranormal Activity 2 our eyes keep darting back and forth scanning the sidewalks the doorways the posh bric-a-brac in that overstuffed kitchen searching (before it can frighten us) for a telltale bit of movement -- for the barest hint of an apparition edging into the frame or an inanimate object that decides to move around on its own. Its like a haunted-house version of Wheres Waldo. Alfred Hitchcock used to say that if you jolted an audience with a bomb blast out of the blue that was merely a shock but if you planted a bomb and made the audience wait for it to go off that was suspense. Paranormal Activity 2 blends the two modes into what might be called shockpense. The film keeps jolting us out of the blue all right -- with sudden booms doors that open of their own accord or a frying pan that drops out of a pot hanger. In a funny way though what makes these devices work is their very randomness They tickle us with terror because watching the movie we do know that a bomb has been planted only its a bomb -- or more accurately a demon -- you cant see. Offhand it would be hard to think of another movie that squeezed more thrills and chills out of a single frozen-camera setup than the original Paranormal Activity. No one who saw it will forget that deceptively bland spooky-neutral gray-and-white shot of a ranch-house bedroom the time code leaping ahead in little jump cuts of fear as the goings-on grew ever more freaky and bumpy-in-the-night. Made for roughly 11000 Paranormal Activity was such an ingenious fusion of form and content that there was every reason to suspect that the sequel would use a bigger budget to deliver fewer goose bumps. But Paranormal Activity 2 directed by the gifted Tod Williams (who has no connection to the original film) is anything but a rip-off. It made me jump sweat and chew my fingernails. Mixed in with the movies stately panoramas of anxiety is the usual clatter of handheld camera and fake-authentic in-your-face acting/nonacting. If The Blair Witch Project set the gold standard for horror-movie performances that sort of kind of convince you that you could be watching an actual documentary Paranormal Activity 2 never quite takes that full creepy-crawly verite leap. The actors are vivid but its a far trickier thing to make us believe that were watching not just a bunch of testy twentysomethings but a complicated nuclear family. It took me a while to register that Kristi (Sprague Grayden) the perky mother of Hunter is married to Daniel (Brian Boland) the gruff and goateed middle-aged dad because they never truly seem like a couple. (Katie Featherston from the first movie makes a welcome reappearance as the same character who is now Kristis more-than-meets-the-eye feisty sister.) There are great horror movies about families who fall apart when goosed by the supernatural but here despite the humanistic background of director Williams (his previous films are the wry and wise Jeff Bridges drama The Door in the Floor and The Adventures of Sebastian Cole) the psychodrama is thin. I also found the ending too abrupt. (Dont worry Im giving away nothing.) For most of Paranormal Activity 2 though youll watch and wait for the unknown and be jittered with pleasure when it arrives.
