Comments click to enlarge Non-Stop Recommended Video Rated PG-13  107 minutes  2014 Director Jaume Collet-Serra and cinematographer Flavio Labiano are both Spanish which might explain why Non-Stop the new Liam Neeson thriller feels more like recent genre entertainment from Spain than from Hollywood the filmmaking is playful without feeling jokey the narrative stuffed with fun complications. Like Nacho Vigalondos Timecrimes (2007) J.A. Bayonas The Orphanage (2007) or Daniel Monzons Cell 211 (2009) Non-Stop exhibits showmanship in its construction and execution alike--one gets the impression the filmmakers had good fun putting it together.

"Liam Neesons Though << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Bridging the Analytics Gap  Next Welcome to Indiana Basketball Facebook Twitter Print Movies Liam Neesons Though Non-Stop is our jam. Plus the reconfigured Son of God. by Wesley Morris on February 28 2014 Anyone planning to see Non-Stop should probably just go see it. This is one of those near-perfect peeled-onion airplane-hijacking thrillers in which each removed layer brings you closer to a single happy tear. The level of ridiculousness is equal to the care put into making the ridiculousness possible. It isnt just the plotting (although the plot goes happily nuts). Its the sense that a director actually directed writers actually wrote and a producer kept the movie together. Its the idea that a genre movie this generic could have been done with mannequins and still almost have worked. Instead its staffed cockpit to coach with good actors having a good time looking suspicious. Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks an American Irishman and federal air marshal and even that bit of information takes 20 minutes to reveal and is treated like Deep Throats identity. Hes on a flight from New York to London and not long after takeoff he exchanges taunting messages with someone on the plane whos feeling greedy (give me 150 million) and murderous (or someone dies every 20 minutes). People do die in part because Bill cant get his TSA contact to believe his story. You see he used to be a cop and a drunk and hes still miserable about the death of his daughter. The account intended for the 150 million has been opened in Bills name (please dont ask how; this movie is the opposite of ""how""). Its much easier for everyone on the flight to believe its Bill whos trying to hijack the plane. So not only does he have to catch a terrorist he also has to persuade the passengers and crew to help him. That takes most of the movie. This is Agatha Christie doing the nasty with Alfred Hitchcock. One reason to just go see for yourself is the surprising pleasure of the small details. The enjoyment being had at every level of this movie is contagious. The filmmakers love the junk theyre making. Neesons incoming texts ding like a bell and spin around him the way stars and birds do around clobbered cartoons. At some point the phone has a broken screen and so the spinning text window appears to be on the fritz too. And the main flight attendants -- played by Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyongo -- wear snazzy sleeveless uniforms a kind of fitted boiled wool with leather accents along the shoulders. Non-Stop is like a hamburger that wouldve been fine as just meat on a bun. But the accumulation of fixings starts to blow your mind. Theres mustard and cheese and mushrooms and jalapenos? Are you kidding me? You come for another helping of Neeson avenging while under siege and get Lady Mary Crawley from Downton Abbey and Patsey from 12 Years a Slave? Plus Corey Stoll Nate Parker Linus Roache Omar Metwally Scoot McNairy Shea Whigham and the tonic-like presence of Julianne Moore. There are a couple of Germans a surly B-boy an accidental daredevil pilot and a tiny unaccompanied minor whos scared to fly. Any one of these people could be guilty and director Jaume Collet-Serra creates the sort of high-suspicion environment that frees you to cast and recast your doubts. Hes the Spaniard who directed Neeson in Unknown. That was an inane paranoia thriller too but it barreled its way to a big nonsense conspiracy ending. The finale of this movie might be more laughable. The explanation for this hijacking is like Scooby-Doo agitprop. The script is credited to John W. Richardson Chris Roach and Ryan Engle and it culminates in a lot of ""Lets roll"" 9/11 do-it-yourself heroism. But it does so in a way that feels more apt than exploitative given the makeup of the passengers. You get over the baffling loony quasi-libertarian politics of personal freedom. There are more absurdly stressful explosive matters at hand like landing intact while flanked by a pair of fighter planes. This is the best of these Liam Neeson post-traumatic-action-hero films. Hes expanded his career fighting terrorists and wolves. Previously theyve kidnapped his daughter (Taken) stolen his memory (Unknown) ruined his suicide plans (The Grey) and kidnapped him (Taken 2). At 61 hes about a decade older than Charlton Heston was at the height of his disaster-and-apocalypse run in the late 1960s and 70s and Neesons not risking as much as Heston did. This stretch of Neesons career is comparable insofar as its possible hes playing different offscreen sorrow. With Heston it was how the movies had changed right under his nose. A repeatedly decimated planet seemed like the right place for a classic-Hollywood star to lose and regain his bearings. Neesons assumption of the melancholy-avenger role began the year before he lost Natasha Richardson in a ski accident. Part of the appeal of him in these movies -- two of which come from Luc Besson -- is that you want to say ""Put the gun down"" and pour him a cup of tea. Since Taken hes played a deep ache instead of action. Its shrewd strategy thats kept Neeson from complete self-parody. Its kept him from becoming Heston. The muscularity on Non-Stop holds the suspense and comedy together. The blasts of air turbulence catch you off guard (they send characters to the ceiling) and make you laugh like when they prevent Neeson from detecting who in the main cabin is texting him. The last big-bang thriller of this kind -- a conceptual Hitchcock riff -- was 2011s Source Code with Jake Gyllenhaal trying over and over to save an exploding train. That movie came with a surprise dose of look-over-your-shoulder science fiction (it had a better script too). But both movies leave you with the sense that somebody cared about how to pull off plots so potentially risible. Collet-Serra has a talent for sustaining the thrill of action sequences beyond whats reasonable and the last sequence in the movie is highly unreasonable. When its over your adrenaline crashes and you can see Non-Stop for the illogic-riddled nonsense it is. But the adrenaline is like a drug. And the drug is something you want again immediately.  Christ movies can give you allegory and parable. They can give you a directors biblical interpretation. Or they can give you 138 minutes of concentrated Scripture that ends with Jesus urging an audience to ""Go into the world and preach the gospel to all creation."" People will always want to spend money for this sort of thing even if theyve already seen it. And in this case theyve literally already seen it. Television producer Mark Burnett and his wife -- Touched by an Angel actress Roma Downey -- helped take five Jesus-oriented episodes of The Bible which was a big hit last year on the History Channel and turn them into Son of God a movie thats like watching the flame of a giant Christmas candle flicker unto eternity. Their abridgment begins with nativity culminates with betrayal and then crucifixion and concludes with resurrection. Meanwhile the Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado plays the title figure as a precious holy instrument wrapped in muslin his arms outstretched forever proclaiming his instrumentality. The movie proceeds with stiff staging stiff acting and the stiff tear-streamed face of Downey as the Virgin Mary. You dont need camp or campiness with a movie like this -- one based on ancient familiar material. Cecil B. DeMille isnt called for (although under the circumstances hed be welcome). All you need is a competent production that takes some risks or has a point of view. Son of God just politely omits the televised sequence with Satan (people complained he looked too much like Barack Obama) adds deleted scenes and divides its villainy between the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate (Greg Hicks) and the Jewish high priest Caiaphas (Adrian Schiller). Otherwise its miracles misery and Jesuss greatest hits (""I Am the Way"" ""Peter Turn the Other Cheek"" ""One of You Will Betray Me""). Youre permitted to believe the Son of God spends a lot of time predicting the apostles bad behavior leaving them with no option but to sit around with guilty and bewildered looks. There are museum walls populated with more riveting accounts. I recommend those. Son of God is grueling in its mildness. It doesnt even come alive for the Stations of the Cross. Morgado mostly smiles and stands and appears. He makes faces of exasperating beatification faces that remind you another word for muslin is ""cheesecloth.""

It may as well be Titanic Air amp; Waterways. But in Non-Stop the latest Liam Neeson thriller plausibility is an ignorable commodity -- just another part of the flight attendants droning instructions that no one pays attention to. In this tale of Air Marshal Bill Marks (Neeson) who in midflight receives text messages warning that someone onboard will be killed every 20 minutes unless 150 million is wired into an electronic account nagging plot questions pop up at a rate faster than the bodies drop. Such as Who is allowed to text at 40000 feet? How does a corpse in a toilet room on a crowded flight remain undetected for six hours? What sort of signal delivers a New York City news station to a plane flying over Iceland? Also for fans of 12 Years a Slave wheres Lupita Nyongo? The Oscar nominee is billed seventh but playing a crew member and sporting a Grace Jones coiffure she has only about three lines of dialogue. (MORE Lupita Nyongo the Oscar Front Runner) And most pertinent Why demand logic of an action movie released in February when audiences just want a nice bumpy ride? Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra the Spaniard who led Neeson through the slightly more ingenious entanglements of Unknown three years ago Non-Stop does provide the requisite emotional turbulence. Marks is your basic flawed hero an alcoholic ex-cop still mourning the death of his 6-year-old daughter (a lazy shameful and standard plot device of action films) who takes the air marshal job despite his fear of flying. He could be the pilot played by Denzel Washington in Flight -- an airman reliable in a tight spot with failings that jeopardize everyones safety -- but sketched in crayon instead of Washingtons subtle strokes. This is not a character study; its a vehicle somewhere between jetliner and jalopy with a cargo of cheap sometimes efficient narrative tricks. (MORE Richard Corliss on Liam Neeson in Unknown) Like a classic or rote whodunit Non-Stop establishes a dozen or so early possible killers all obvious stereotypes. Aside from the frequent flyer (Julianne Moore playing more or less the Vera Farmiga role in Up in the Air) who insists on sitting next to Marks you get the skull-shaved hothead (Corey Stoll) the nerdy businessman (Scott McNairy) the strangely quiet Muslim (Omar Metwally) and the angry black dude (Nate Parker). Maybe the pilot (Jason Butler Harner) is the miscreant or the friendly stewardess (Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery). Each gets to cast a glowering or guilt-streaked glance Marks way until the viewer begins to suspect all of them. Why couldnt it be the sweet little girl (Quinn McColgan) traveling alone who reminds Marks of his late daughter? Maybe shes back from the grave seeking airborne revenge. (Note to the curious Do not check IMDBs cast billing for Non-Stop. It provides inadvertent clues to the perps identity. Also do not pay attention to the explanation provided for the hijacking; its the same terrorist-victim gargle proposed in the 2006 British fakeumentary Death of a President.) (MORE When the Movies Killed George W. Bush in Death of a President) In a cute second-act twist (revealed in the trailer which semaphores most of the story by packing 45 shots into 30 seconds) Marks is not only the hero but also the main suspect that 150 million ransom went into his account. Mr. or Ms. Evil knows a lot of Marks backstory as we see in the text messages that float across the movie screen like a comic strips thought balloons. The films writers John W. Richardson Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle know a few things too about airplane melodramas. At least theyve watched them such golden age wheezers as The High and the Mighty and Zero Hour (the inspiration for Airplane) plus the post-9/11 thrillers United 93 (desperate passengers rush the suspected hijacker) and Flightplan (an imperiled child an air marshal and a secret villain). John Wayne played the pilot in The High and the Mighty and Neeson in his late-blooming stardom has a lot of the Dukes truculence and physical authority. The persona of both actors is a troubled man whose interior demons are the very source and spur to his strength in a crisis. Indeed the Neeson character comes to life only in a crisis. His ""very particular set of skills"" as he says in Taken the 2008 movie that launched his action-stud celebrity are useful mainly in ending or saving lives. Away from the heat hes a lousy husband and father a disaster at domesticity as he shouts in Non-Stops big confession scene. Thats become a trope of Neeson movies -- a series so successful it has become its own genre with avatars like Kevin Costner filling in for Neeson in 3 Days to Kill. (MORE Costner Does Neeson in 3 Days to Kill) Shot in grainy unflattering closeups occasionally alleviated by flashily edited fight scenes Non-Stop is no more or less than what it intends to be the kind of midlevel brainless entertainment you might watch between meals and naps on an international flight. Try to enjoy the ride -- and no texting please.

Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Neeson has been through these hulky haggard paces before in the ""Taken"" movies and ""Unknown"" which like ""Non-Stop"" was directed by Jaume Collet-Sera (who already has a new Neeson actioner in the can). Neeson must be amused that an actor of his range and power has settled into a late-state career playing woebegone action-hero lugs. (Hes laughing all the way to the bank.) He plays them well though. He could be the thinking mans Charles Bronson although theres far more punching than thinking going on here. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Julianne Moore turns up as a secretive seat mate. (Could she be the texter?) Like Neeson she tries to give this old worn-out shoe some polish.

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 28 2014 833AM EST Last updated Friday Feb. 28 2014 234PM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra Written by John W. Richardson Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle Starring Liam Neeson Julianne Moore and Lupita Nyongo Classification PG Country USA Language English No one beats the living hell out of bad guys so thoroughly enjoyably on screen as Liam Neeson. It makes no sense but there it is.The rebirth of dopey rom-com king Matthew McConaughey into a respected serious award-winning actor (coined the McConaissance) barely warrants a shrug compared to the guilty fascination of Neesons late-career transformation into an action star. Name one other living action hero that has a resume that includes roles as Jean Valjean and Oskar Schindler. A lot of people will pay to see Non-Stop expecting the kind of action movie that Neeson who is now 61 has become famous for in the past few years (such as Taken and The Grey.) They however will be disappointed. Despite what the traditional action-thriller trailer would have you think Non-Stop isnt really an action movie. Its a Hitchcockian murder-mystery thriller for the post-9/11 era.Neeson stars as Bill Marks a U.S. air marshal with a troubled personal life first hinted at when hes shown thumbing a bottle of booze before boarding a transatlantic flight.Once hes settled in his seat he receives a text message saying that someone on the plane will die every 20 minutes unless 150-million is deposited into a bank account. Whos sending the messages? Is it the Muslim doctor? The mysterious woman played by Julianne Moore? What about the school teacher who was asking Marks questions back at the airport?More importantly why arent we watching Neeson wreak vengeance on some stereotypically cast (if politically incorrect) villain? It was pure gold in Taken Taken 2 and The Grey. At least let the guy punch out a wolf or two just to get the blood lust running.Here though the battles are mostly psychological. Director Jaume Collet-Serra does a fine job of establishing an atmosphere where everyone is a suspect an essential element for this kind of close-quarters whodunit. Many of the passengers begin to suspect that Marks is the villain.Neeson and Collet-Serra played similar mind games in their previous outing Unknown. There Neeson played a man who wakes from a coma to discover his identity has been stolen and who must fend off assassins while proving he is who he says he is. It wasnt the kind of action movie that gets audiences worked up into a howling lather. Neither is Non-Stop. But it does have the same B-movie over-the-top appeal that Neeson is able to elevate.Its unfair to judge Non-Stop as one of the Liam Neeson exploitation movies audiences have come to love. (The subgenre has been dubbed ""Neesploitation."") Nor is it fair to say the main problem with Non-Stop is that its plot is so improbable. There was lots of ""improbable"" in Taken but that movie was awesome bone-crushing fun.The problem is that Non-Stop tries to be something its not. It has one too many scenes that border on ludicrous and the big reveal barely makes sense. If you want to watch Liam Neeson play Agatha Christie with a cellphone have at it.

His new thriller Non-Stop is a hijack picture with a mystery villain Someone onboard keeps texting Air Marshal Neeson a threat A person will die every 20 minutes if 150 million is not deposited into a numbered account. Oddly when Neeson starts making noises to the pilots and his on-the-phone superior (Shea Whigham) everyone thinks hes the hijacker. And who knows? He might be. Hes unstable enough. Hes a boozer. Maybe hes texting himself the way Edward Norton kept beating himself up in Fight Club. The movie has so many red herrings its amazing the theater doesnt smell like a fish store. Jittery Julianne Moore wants a window seat and trades with computer programmer Nate Parker -- which puts her next to Neeson but not so close that when shes turned away she couldnt be texting. Director Jaume Collet-Serra (Unknown) lingers on Moore as she flashes Neeson significant looks so suddenly youre thinking Its her. Shes the one Then No hold on they just want us to think shes the one. She looks at him like that because shes thinking hes the one. But then Collet-Serra lingers on another passenger and it all begins again Its him Its definitely him Its one of the pilots. Its Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery as a flight attendant. Its Lupita Nyongo as another flight attendant. (Wait -- Lupita Nyongo? With like no lines? Talk about indentured servitude ...) Its House of Cardss Corey Stoll as a belligerent New York cop ... at least he says hes a New York cop. Its Scoot McNairy as a guy who told Neeson outside the airport he was going to Amsterdam not London. Could it be the scared little girl who dropped her bear getting on the plane? Collet-Serra after all directed Orphan. Did you ever see that terrible but fun 70s picture Skyjacked with Charlton Heston? Someone wrote in lipstick on the mirror that there was a bomb onboard and if the plane didnt go to Moscow to Moscow to Moscow it would blow. Thats the last whodunit in the air I can remember and the identity of the hijacker was pretty obvious. This one doesnt have as many laughs but its much better. There are all sorts of tightly packed frames and jangly close-ups and that omnipresent hum of engines and a pressurized cabin to make you claustrophobic. The fights when they come are head-rocking. True there are some Skyjacked-worthy speeches. But Neeson is such an eloquent hunk of Irish melancholy that he gives everything he does -- snapping a neck or taking a drink of water -- a classical gravitas. The question hangs Do we have enough information to play detective and figure out whos guilty? Or will the hijacker-killer be an arbitrary suspect who pops up in the climax and says ""Its me heh-heh ..."" The answer to that question is ... Im not saying. The key to a good B-mystery is that all the actors should be a little stilted. You should never know the difference between an actor acting badly and an actor doing a masterful acting job of someone acting badly. In Non-Stop there is much excellent bad acting.

"Review Force is with Liam Neeson in Non-Stops airborne whodunit - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Force is with Liam Neeson in Non-Stops airborne whodunit Non-Stop Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Non-Stop starring Liam Neeson Julianne Moore Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyongo. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews Non-Stop starring Liam Neeson Julianne Moore Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyongo. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic For years decades even Liam Neeson was an action hero hidden in plain sight.Yes he was an impressive 6-foot-4 with the rangy physical grace of the former amateur boxing champion still visible but the Oscar nominee for ""Schindlers List"" could put you away with his acting. Was it necessary or even prudent to have him throttle evildoers with his bare hands? FOR THE RECORD ""Non-Stop"" A review of ""Non-Stop"" in the Feb. 28 Calendar section said the movie opens with air marshal Bill Marks (played by Liam Neeson) waiting for a flight to Amsterdam. He is waiting for a flight to London. -- After the box office colossus that was 2008s ""Taken"" however Neesons gift for big-screen heroics was a secret no more. But as ""Non-Stop"" his latest foray into blockbuster territory demonstrates the abilities that made him a formidable actor have been key to his success in this more physical world.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | OlsenEffectively directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who previously worked with Neeson in ""Unknown"" ""Non-Stop"" is a crisp efficient thriller that benefits greatly from the intangibles Neeson can be counted on to supply. The actors face is capable of convincing anguish and despair as well as naked fury and when he invests himself in a scenario his authority and integrity sweep us along with him. These are essential qualities to have when your story of serial murder on an airplane cruising at 40000 feet is not exactly a model of plausibility.We first meet Neesons Bill Marks in his car in a New York airport parking lot not having the best of days and in fact looking as he shakily pours some Scotch into a paper cup like he hasnt had a good day in quite some time.No Marks is not a pilot (that was Denzel Washington in ""Flight"") but its almost as bad This nervous wreck is one of some 4000 U.S. Air Marshals tasked with keeping our skies safe from harm.Waiting for his flight to Amsterdam on mythical British Aqualantic airlines Marks lethargically scans the other passengers to see who if anyone looks suspicious. Not only is his heart no longer in his job we soon find out hes scared of flying as well.PHOTOS Movie Sneaks 2013The big galoots heart however is still in the right place. He takes some time with a frightened little girl whos never flown before (this film really does pull out all the stops) and when an entitled Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) insists she simply must have a window seat he guilts the guy sitting next to him into giving up his.Marks real troubles start right after takeoff. He gets a text message on his secure network no less informing him that unless he arranges for 150 million to be deposited in a secure account someone on the flight will die every 20 minutes. Starting now.As cannily put together by screenwriters John W. Richardson amp; Chris Roach and Ryan Engle ""Non-Stops"" plot combines two classic mystery devices. One is a variant of the locked room enigma How is it possible to kill people on an airplane without giving away who you are? The second device was popularized by Agatha Christie in plots like ""Murder on the Orient Express"" and ""And Then There Were None"" One member of a group is intent on killing the other people in it.Obviously those seeking iron-clad plausibility should look elsewhere but ""Non-Stop"" does have its share of unanticipated sequences as well as Neesons forcefulness. The actor throws himself wholeheartedly into the proceedings prowling the aisles like a vengeful ghost trying to keep his own demons in check while matching wits with an enemy who always seems to be one step ahead of him.OSCAR WATCH 2014 Everything you need to knowCinematographer Flavio Labianos camera never leaves the plane while the game is afoot and Jim Mays editing and John Ottmans music add to the pressure essentially making us feel as trapped as the increasingly restive passengers.As satisfying as Neeson is its crucial to surround him with solid actors and as cast by Amanda Mackey and Cathy Sandrich Gelfond ""Non-Stop"" makes excellent use of hard-working professionals like Scoot McNairy Nate Parker and Corey Stoll as fellow passengers on this unlucky flight.And what would an airplane movie be without a pair of plucky flight attendants always rock solid in an emergency. ""Non-Stop"" is especially fortunate here with a crew consisting of Michelle Dockery slumming after years as Lady Mary in ""Downton Abbey"" and ""12 Years a Slave"" Academy Award nominee Lupita Nyongo as the trusty No. 2. No matter what happens at the Oscars on Sunday its safe to predict this will be the last time Nyongo gets seventh billing in anything. kenneth.turanlatimes.com-------------------------------------- Non-StopMPAA rating PG-13 for intense action and violence some language sensuality and drug referencesRunning time 1 hour 45 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Liam Neeson Reviews Lupita Nyongo Agatha Christie Denzel Washington Non-Stop Non-Stop Liam Neeson thinks its his Everyman appeal that resonates Natasha Richardsons death still not 100% real for Liam Neeson Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-non-stop-review-20140228,0,3330811.story#axzz2uZqoPLHk",200,non-stop9,non-stop,latimes
"Non-Stop | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; non-stop ) Non-Stop (United States 2014) February 27 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Non-Stop plays like what might happen if Michael Bay directed a screenplay developed for Alfred Hitchcock. The movie while so utterly preposterous as to provoke guffaws is presented in such a way that theres a building sense of tension. As a result Non-Stop offers a couple of suspense-filled hours that stretches the viewers credulity to the breaking point. Put it in the ""guilty pleasure"" category. For those who have become fans of Liam Neeson through his butt-kicking movies (Taken Taken 2 The Grey etc.) this is yet another one to throw into that category. It provides what it promises. Bill Marks (Neeson) is a broken-down alcoholic man whose life is falling apart. He also happens to be a Federal air marshal. On his latest flight a transatlantic excursion bound for London he encounters a terrorist situation. An anonymous e-mailer sends him a message over a secure system informing him that if 150 million isnt deposited into an account one person on the plane will die every 20 minutes. At first Bill isnt sure what to make of the threat. He discusses it with fellow marshal Jack Hammond (Anson Mount) and informs the captain and the head flight attendant Nancy (Michelle Dockery). The allotted time passes and Bill is forced to take the situation seriously when one body turns up. But theres a twist the terrorists plot isnt just about making a lot of money its about framing Bill for his/her actions. The average plane-based thriller has obvious advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand the enclosed space and limited number of characters make it an excellent setting for a classic mystery-thriller. On the other hand its easy for the action to get very silly. Non-Stop does a solid job of making use of the former but also treads into the territory of the latter. The absurdities dont get close to those of Snakes on a Plane however. This is more in line with Air Force One although its not as tightly wound as Wolfgang Petersens 1997 thriller starring Harrison Ford as the U.S. President. Plot holes abound some of which are glaring. Director Jaume Collet-Serra (who previously worked with Neeson in Unknown) and his screenwriters are able to effectively conceal the ""reveal"" in the usual bucket of red herrings. Few viewers will feel cheated by the way things turn out. The narrative features its share of twists and turns some more plausible than others but one gets the sense Hitchcock might have been entertained by this sort of movie although his approach would have focused on the slow-burn paranoia rather than lavatory fight scenes. Neeson who might have seemed an unlikely action hero before playing a Jedi Knight and a Batman nemesis works in this kind of role because viewers perceive him as a decent righteous individual. Even considering Bills various character flaws (he drinks smokes and is generally unfriendly) were immediately in his corner. Most of the planes passengers are played by relatively anonymous actors. One exception is Julianne Moore who portrays the woman in the seat next to Bill. Another is Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery as a flight attendant. Sharp-eyed viewers might recognize Oscar nominee Lupita Nyongo in a small role as another flight attendant. She has about three lines of dialogue. Presumably a Supporting Actress award for 12 Years a Slave will ensure she doesnt get stuck with parts like this in the future. Non-Stop is forgettable disposable entertainment. Its cinematic junk food. It tastes good during consumption but offers nothing of lasting value. It has solid crowd appeal and given the publics easy acceptance of Liam Neeson as an action hero will probably perform well at the box office. For two hours its fun but a couple of days later it will be forgotten.

Grade B- Jaume Collet-Serra who directed Liam Neeson in ""Unknown"" and ""Non-Stop"" has realized that the more angst Neeson shoulders the better time he has charging through action with glints of gallows humor. Neeson is a Magic Mountain of a movie star a one-man haven for humanity in an insane world especially in a film as fundamentally absurd as ""Non-Stop."" Neeson plays an alcoholic U.S. Air Marshal who never recovered from the leukemia death of his young daughter and now funnels all his energy into protecting passengers. Shortly after stirring some hardcore liquor into take-out coffee he boards a plane bound from New York to London and becomes the target of a threat - someone onboard will die in 20 minutes unless he arranges for 150 million to be transmitted to a numbered account. He trusts the worldly empathetic woman next to him (Julianne Moore) and the warm alert chief stewardess (Michelle Dockery). Otherwise hes alone - even his TSA bosses consider him a whack job or a terrorist. Through force of thespian will Neeson keeps the audience rooting for him to sharpen his wits as he shakes off his melancholy glaze. Moore stays right with him scoring laughs with swift shifts in attitude and tone and rousing applause from objecting to being called ""Maam."" As a stylist Collet-Serra doubles down on the boarding area (which Neeson cases out despite an aura of fatigue and booze) then has nothing left. And the screenwriters John W. Richardson Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle hinge too much of the movie on manipulating cell phones. But everywhere you look theres someone fun to watch - Lupita Nyongo shows up elegant if not much else as a fill-in stewardess. Corey Stoll (Hemingway in ""Midnight in Paris"" the tragic Rep. Peter Russo in ""House of Cards"") brings a bristling unpredictable temperament to a usual suspect sort of role. Logic falls apart midway through but I enjoyed myself anyway because I saw this disreputable thriller as a hearty Bronx cheer hurled at that pompous prestige picture ""Flight.""

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1147 a.m. EST February 28 2014Everyone aboard the plane is a suspect in the attempted extortion and murder plot in this enjoyably implausible thriller. What it lacks in believability it makes up for in strong performances.Liam Neeson stars in the new airborne thriller ""Non-Stop.""(Photo Myles Aronowitz Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2Stars Liam Neeson Julianne Moore Lupita Nyongo Scoot McNairy Michelle Dockery Nate Parker Corey StollRated PG-13; Runtime 1 hour 46 minutes; opens Friday nationwideForget snakes on a plane. Cellphones on a plane can be far more lethal.The airlines might consider using Non-Stop (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opening Friday nationwide) in an appeal to the FAA to keep the ban on in-flight mobile phone use intact.One thing is certain This tale of horror at 40000 feet wont be popping up as in-flight entertainment. A threatened hijacking on-board gunfire and roughed up passengers are airline poison.While its entertaining trying to suss out who the bad guy is in this mile-high whodunit its almost as fun watching a 60ish action star like Liam Neeson take on legions of younger fitter folks and fend them off. Its Taken in the not-so-friendly skies.Neeson plays U.S. air marshal Bill Marks an alcoholic mess whos such a slave to his addictions that he goes into the planes bathroom covers the smoke alarm with duct tape and lights up. Before he gets on the flight he swigs booze from a bottle while parked in his SUV stirring it with a toothbrush. Though conjuring memories of Lloyd Bridges hilarious plane dispatcher in Airplane Marks smoking jones and car seat drinking are intended to convince viewers he is a man beset by demons.STORY Liam Neeson puts up a good fight as Non-Stop action heroREVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersNeeson projects a wounded dignity that works well in the part.Did we mention that he stares at couples kissing with a blend of longing and resentment? We learn later why Marks is so emotionally tortured. But how this air marshal hasnt lost his badge is anybodys guess.Marks is assigned to a red-eye from New York to London. Its clear hes a tough guy when he glares at a self-absorbed man holding up the security line while on the phone. Its just as evident hes a gentle soul when he returns a dropped teddy bear to a little girl.He connects early on with a passenger sitting beside him. Shes Jen played with an intriguing blend of kindness and mystery by Julianne Moore.Shortly after takeoff Marks gets a text from an anonymous passenger threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes until a huge sum is wired to a designated checking account.Logistics are murky. The film ostensibly takes place after the ban on cellphone use on flights has been officially lifted. And the roominess of aisles even in economy class would make frequent fliers swoon. But director Jaume Collet-Serra makes good use of airplane layout emphasizing visual obstructions which heighten an overall feeling of suspicion.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Liam Neeson plays a U.S. Marshal trying to stop a terrorist onboard his non-stop flight from New York to London. The terrorist turns the tables on Neeson however framing him for the crimes. VPCWhile it takes stabs at realism mostly in its use of cellular and computer technology disbelief must be suspended for full immersion in this twisty airborne thriller.Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery projects a modern-day version of Lady Marys steely determination as an ultra-competent flight attendant. Unfortunately Oscar nominee Lupita Nyongo is relegated to near-extra status as a rarely seen or heard crew member.The script cleverly plays on post-9/11 paranoia. Panic gives way to take-charge collaboration among passengers recalling United 93.Possible culprits loom and shift as quickly as passing clouds over the Atlantic. An initially promising mystery Non-Stop screeches to a halt near the end.The resolution is hard to buy and oddly dated. But the medias rush to judgment -- as a video taken midair goes viral -- intriguingly highlights the potential for dangerous fallibility in breaking-news coverage.While intermittently far-fetched Non-Stop is a turbulent high-altitude thrill ride with unnerving action scenes a strong cast and ample tension. 42 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1bPFrzn",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/02/27/non-stop-review/4991291/,200,non-stop12,non-stop,usatoday

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 428pm on Thursday Feb. 27 2014 Thursday Feb. 27 2014 Thursday Feb. 27 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram OK Liam Neeson we get it.Youre a 61-year-old guy who can bust heads and snap arms with the best of them. And yes it worked like a charm in Taken -- which packed the punch of surprise because who knew the guy from Schindlers List was such a brawler? But the halo of goodwill from that film is starting to tarnish. How many of these types of movies is Neeson going to make?Which brings us to his latest Non-Stop an efficiently made exercise in airplane claustrophobia that takes off well enough but then crash-lands in the third act under the weight of its red herrings improbability and plot twists. Its not a complete waste of time but it is a waste of an extremely talented cast including Julianne Moore Scoot McNairy ( Argo) Michelle Dockery ( Downton Abbey) Corey Stoll ( House of Cards) Lupita Nyongo ( 12 Years a Slave) and of course Neeson.Bill Marks (Neeson) is a sad sack of a man struggling with alcoholism after his young daughter dies of cancer. He has lost his job as a cop but finds work as an air marshal criss-crossing the skies as an undercover agent hunting for any hint of wrongdoing among his fellow passengers. The movie begins as Marks is scoping out what will turn out to be a fateful New York-to-London flight. Not long after takeoff and the making of small talk with his seatmate Jen (Moore) he receives a text message on his cellphone which is supposed to be a secure line. The message says that if a large amount of money isnt wired to a certain number there will be a death on the plane every 20 minutes.Its in these early moments when Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan Unknown) working from a script by John W. Richardson Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle is at his most effective. After all who isnt just a bit tense when getting on a plane these days?Collet-Serra builds on that fear and the suspicion that it could be anyone on board -- including Jen or the attentive and inquisitive flight attendant (Dockery) or maybe even the other marshal whos on the flight -- whos sending the texts. In fact one of the films best scenes is a little mano-a-mano action between the air marshals within the confines of an airplane restroom.Marks starts interrogating (and abusing) just about everyone including a mild-mannered teacher (McNairy) an off-duty New York City cop (Stoll) and a mouthy young man (Corey Hawkins). But the longer the plane stays in the air and the closer the film gets to its big reveal the more it unravels. In predictable fashion the evildoer even takes time out in the midst of the climactic evildoing to explain everything. And thats coupled with the usual round of disaster-movie child endangerment that was presaged early on when Marks talks a skittish young girl -- traveling alone to meet her dad in England -- into boarding the plane.For all of its flaws though Non-Stop does generate more scares and suspense than another recent Neeson skull-knocker the abysmal Taken 2. But the really terrifying thing is whats on the list of Neesons upcoming projects Taken 3. It looks like ""non-stop"" is also the phrase that sums up Neesons career these days.

Myles Aronowitz/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Myles Aronowitz/Universal Pictures Non-Stop Director Jaume Collet-Serra Genre Action Thriller Running time 106 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence some language sensuality and drug references With Liam Neeson Julianne Moore Michelle Dockery Lupita Nyongo ""Have you ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?"" So asks one character in Edgar Wrights excellent 2007 comedic tribute to buddy-cop movies Hot Fuzz in a moment meant to highlight the simultaneous ridiculousness and awesomeness of that particular action-movie trope. In Non-Stop Liam Neeson doesnt fire two guns nor does he jump through the air. He does however grab a gun in midair while in a zero-G nosedive on a trans-Atlantic flight and fire said gun while floating through the cabin. In slow motion. Its Neeson at his Neesoniest and yet another entry in his expanding late-career bloom into gruff and commanding action hero. Monkey See Hurts So Good Getting A Kick Out Of A Movie Punch Non-Stop bears a surface similarity to the glossy European-style high trash of 2008s Taken but Neesons Bill Marks in this film is a far cry from the ex-CIA operative -- ""with a very particular set of skills"" -- he played in that film. Marks is a federal air marshal and his particular skills largely involve numbing himself with a very Irish coffee on the way to his next flight and managing to have a smoke undetected in the airplane lavatory. The flight attendants on his regular New York-London route know his habits well enough that they bring him bottled water when he futilely orders a gin and tonic. We see the flight as he sees it hazily as an endless parade of potential evildoers even though chances are that in the course of his air-marshal career -- which hes landed in after a personal tragedy gets him kicked off the police force -- its unlikely hell ever share a cabin with an actual terrorist. YouTube Except of course on this day The secure network Marks uses to communicate with the TSA is breached and he begins receiving texts from a passenger on his flight who claims someone on the plane will be killed every 20 minutes unless 150 million is transferred into a specified bank account. So begins a lengthy game of cat-and-mouse as Marks tries to solve an increasing number of murders on this trans-Atlantic express. The films early look through Marks eyes at his fellow fliers winds up being extremely important; Non-Stop is less a nonstop actioner and more a highflying whodunit. As such its important for director Jaume Collet-Serra and writers John W. Richardson and Christopher Roach to keep viewers guessing until the big reveal. They may go a little overboard Of the planes 150 passengers a remarkably high percentage spend time as potential suspects making this jet into a flying tin can of red herring. The confusion over the identity of the killer who mysteriously manages to text Marks constantly while killing multiple people midflight without being detected also serves to leave the marshal barely in control of the passengers. For a variety of reasons they think its Marks himself whos causing the chaos and perhaps even hijacking the flight. Non-Stop isnt a great film; it may not even be very good and its undeniably convoluted and silly. Yet I enjoyed nearly every moment. Sure its probably 15 minutes overlong thanks to that excess of misdirection. Add to that the ham-handed politics of the real intentions of the hijacker once the big reveal finally comes -- the culmination of an undercurrent of blunt political commentary about air security and prejudicial assumptions about terrorism that runs through the entire film. But if it works its because Neeson and Collet-Serra as well as Julianne Moore as Neesons business-class seatmate Jen are all fully aware of how ludicrous this exercise is. Witness the wry joke Collet-Serra uses to obscure onscreen expletives in text messages that would have otherwise given the film an R-rating or the way Moores breezy nonchalance provides a counterbalance to Neesons studied intensity. And especially take note of that midair gravity-free gun grab which is a winking celebration of everything thats completely absurd about this sort of film. Neeson does indeed have a very particular set of skills -- in elevating the generic action thriller into guilt-free popcorn pleasure.

February 27 2014 -- 245pm  Dml - Associated Press - Ap This image released by Universal Pictures shows Liam Neeson in a scene from ""Non-Stop."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert ""Non-Stop"" is a sky-high downer. What a waste of a great premise a locked-room mystery at 30000 feet. Liam Neeson plays an air marshal on a New York-to-London flight. Somewhere among the 150 passengers and crew is an extortionist threatening to kill innocent travelers one by one unless a large ransom is paid. How can the lawman thwart the plot? How can he even investigate without throwing the cabin into mass panic? The gloomy prologue had me leaning forward in full upright position. The opening scenes with Neeson pounding down a pre-flight cocktail of Scotch and breath spray tersely peg him as a seriously flawed hero. Director Jaume Collet-Serra shoots the introduction in shallow depth of field echoing Neesons woozy perspective. We observe fateful details. Who is the fellow who knowingly offers Neeson eyedrops in the airport lavatory? Why does Neesons seatmate on the flight Julianne Moore have a surgical scar on her sternum? Rising star Lupita Nyongo (""12 Years a Slave"") plays a seemingly minor role as an air hostess. Is that just a quirk of casting or is she a key character in camouflage? The suspense fan in me was more than ready for takeoff. Then the film tailspins from whodunit to whydidtheybother? Bodies start dropping. Taunting text messages appear on Neesons cellphone. Implausibilities pile up like luggage on a baggage claim carousel. The extortionist has an almost telepathic knowledge of Neesons background and minute-to-minute actions and is a deadly sniper with a peashooter. Characters change their stripes from belligerent to heroic at the screenwriters whim. A near-mutiny among terrified fliers is quashed with a promise of free air travel. Nothing stacks up as the movie wallows in ""Snakes on a Plane"" absurdity. Logic is the first casualty in contrived thrillers and this script by an undistinguished committee of writers murders it with a thousand wounds. non-stop 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence some language sensuality and drug references. Physics takes a pounding too. Once again we see a gunshot through the fuselage creating a catastrophic vacuum vortex that rips the planes hull apart. Thats impossible. The air pressurization system would compensate for a bullet-hole leak. It wouldnt even ruffle your hair. And dont even get me started about the absurd power-dive episode of zero gravity. What a shame it is that Neesons best role in years is as a teensy plastic policeman in ""The Lego Movie."" Hes a powerful presence both in his athletic assurance (no creaky joints for this 61-year-old) and his mournful gravitas. Yet hes becoming a synonym for mindless action-movie mediocrity. From the A list to ""The A-Team."" Now thats a rough landing. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Photo Credit Universal Pictures / Myles Aronowitz advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT On a trans-Atlantic flight a U.S. air marshal must stop an unseen terrorist from killing one passenger every 20 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence smoking) BOTTOM LINE Quick pacing and the always-dependable Neeson help guide this nifty thriller through some rough spots. Its disposable good fun. CAST Liam Neeson Julianne Moore Lupita Nyongo LENGTH 146 The journey is the destination in ""Non-Stop"" a fast-paced thriller set 35000 feet in the air. The story of a man trying to outwit a murderous mastermind during a trans-Atlantic flight ""Non-Stop"" may be a tad derivative -- you could call it ""Sky Hard"" -- and its ending crash-lands in more ways than one. When all its engines are firing however its a heck of a ride. Were in good hands with Liam Neeson the appealingly blunt action figure of the ""Taken"" movies here playing Bill Marks a U.S. air marshal on a New York-to-London flight. Marks is commanding capable and slightly damaged He drinks too much and smokes in the bathroom. His fear of flying () gets a little worse when he receives a text message from someone threatening to kill one passenger every 20 minutes until 150 million is wired to an offshore account. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Suddenly everyones a suspect from the passengers (Julianne Moore plays Jen a woman who requests the seat next to Marks) to the crew (Oscar-nominated Lupita Nyongo appears briefly as a flight attendant). Theres a lot to admire in this genre flick beginning with the nifty premise. The screenwriters (all three of them) make their seemingly impossible plot work with a combination of clever twists red herrings and the occasional broken law of physics. (Can two men fit in an airplane lavatory let alone brawl in one?) The movie repeats itself but thats forgivable There are only so many ways to get away with murder in coach. ""Non-Stop"" also deserves credit for fully embracing technology. Many thrillers find ways to disable or simply ignore plot-killing cellphones but ""Non-Stop"" couldnt exist without them. Most of the taunts between Marks and his adversary arent spoken but texted and director Jaume Collet-Serra (the 2011 Neeson vehicle ""Unknown"") finds an aesthetically appealing way to float their dialogue balloons onto the screen. (A prediction about the popularity of texting At this rate well be back to reading title cards in silent movies.) 110 MoviesLiam Neeson stars in Non-Stop The attacks of Sept. 11 figure into ""Non-Stop"" in ways that can be clever but may strike some as a little glib. Still ""Non-Stop"" is fun disposable entertainment. It would actually be perfect for an in-flight movie. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT On a trans-Atlantic flight a U.S. air marshal must stop an unseen terrorist from killing one passenger every 20 minutes.

An air marshal springs into action during a flight after receiving messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers 150 million into an off-shore account. (Photo/Video Universal) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Updated Feb. 27 2014 1002 p.m. ET Keen logician that he was George Carlin took a dim view of airlines offering nonstop flights. ""I dont think I care for that"" he would say warily. ""I insist that my flights stop. Preferably at an airport."" In fact ""Non-Stop"" comes to a dramatic stop although revealing how and where would spoil the fun of this suspense thriller which was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. Much of the fun is awfully silly. The story strains logic as well as credulity. Its been cobbled together often crudely from pieces of classic predecessors. (Here snippets of Hitchcock there stretches of ""Speed"" with wings on the bus.) Yet the silliness parades itself in a spirit of cheerful self-awareness while Liam Neeson fills the thrill quotient impressively as an air marshal Bill Marks who learns that a terrorist with a bomb is lurking aboard his trans-Atlantic flight. For specific details of the threat and Bills tortuous involvement in it feel free to consult the trailer; seldom has a movies marketing campaign given away more plot points. The trailer still functions as a tease though since the script by John W. Richardson Chris Roach and Ryan Engle keeps an assortment of surprises and amusing absurdities in reserve. By elevating Agatha Christie to 40000 feet ""Non-Stop"" plays a reliably old-fashioned game of finding the bad guy among 150 passengers who include a readily identifiable Muslim male (that lifts the cloud of suspicion from him or does it?); Bills outwardly normal and extremely attractive seatmate played by Julianne Moore (all too many villains are outwardly normal) and a crew that includes Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyongo as flight attendants. (One reminder that cuts two ways Ms. Nyongo hadnt won an Oscar nomination when she was cast for this role.) Setting a movie inside an airliner is a shrewd move economically--almost all of the action contained within a single set no expensive location filming no worries about weather. Its also an effective tactic dramatically. Weve all been uneasy at one time or another about something that has seemed to threaten the serenity of a commercial flight. The threats to this flight come with relentless regularity--not just the bomb with its standard-issue digital countdown clock but a sequence of ultimatums each with its own countdown that up the terror ante without bringing down the whole airplane. At one point theres so much crowding and commotion in the aisles that the wide-body jet looks like the London Tube during rush hour. Later in the course of an increasingly bumpy trip all hell breaks loose much as it did in the Denzel Washington film ""Flight"" except that this plane doesnt fly upside down. Originality is not the scripts strong suit. Bill Marks could pass for an emotional clone of the pilot Mr. Washington played; both men are depressed boozers in search of redemption. And the motive for the villainy once revealed is both preposterous and diffuse--so much so that it seems to have been concocted at some desperate last-minute story conference. What holds the movie together and us in its thrall is Mr. Neesons big often bludgeony presence. He makes a doomy action hero but a commanding one from the moment we learn that air marshal or not Bill is a white-knuckle flier not to mention a bare-knuckle brawler when the occasion demands it. The star and his director previously collaborated on ""Unknown"" a clumsy thriller that surprised all concerned by cleaning up at the box office. How will this one do? For a clue we return to the logic of George Carlin. Its incorrect he observed to speak of a near-miss. When two airplanes come close without colliding its a near-hit. ""Non-Stop"" feels like a near-hit and maybe not so near. Watch a clip from the film ""The Lunchbox."" A mistaken delivery in Mumbais famously efficient lunchbox delivery system connects a young housewife to an older man and they build a fantasy world together through notes in the lunchbox. (Photo/Video Sony) The Lunchbox Sometimes according to one of the many nuggets of wisdom in ""The Lunchbox"" the wrong train will get you to the right station. Thats an apt image for what happens in this wonderfully fresh and affecting fable from India. Its jumping-off point isnt trains but an intricate system of transport and delivery in contemporary Mumbai that allows thousands of office workers each day to receive hot lunches that their wives have cooked at home. The system is reputed to work almost flawlessly but mistakes can happen and Ritesh Batras feature debut depicts one of them a happy accident of misrouting that connects two unhappy strangers. Neither one suspects at first that something has gone wrong let alone potentially right. A middle-class housewife Ila (Nimrat Kaur) wants to restore some spice to her moribund marriage so she uses all the condiments at her command to please her disaffected husband. A civil servant Saajan (Irrfan Khan) doesnt have a wife--hes a lonely widower about to retire after 35 years--but he has his office lunches delivered from a commercial kitchen and the meal that comes from Ila unbeknownst to him tickles his palate strikes his fancy and inflames his curiosity. On Ilas side though her husbands continued indifference at home prompts her to include a note in the next days lunchbox. Reading the note Saajan cant resist sending back a response. Thus does an emphasis on gastronomy give way to an epistolary romance at the virtual intersection of food and love. Strayed notes and hidden identities are the stuff of countless plots. Still ""The Lunchbox"" tells its tale with exceptional grace and an urgency that grows paradoxically from its slow but assured pace. (And its quietude; the films Mumbai neighborhoods are poetically calm.) Mr. Batra tells us a lot about his endearing couple but he invites us to infer a lot more and its a winning strategy. Ila knows shes committing a kind of adultery by continuing the communication with notes as well as nourishment but shes clearly had enough of her life. Saajan looks to be hale and hearty but hes terrified of growing old. The centrality of food provokes inevitable--and enjoyable--associations I thought of ""Ratatouille"" when Saajan first smells Ilas fatefully alluring cauliflower. The scent of mortality also recalls Anthony Hopkinss aging repressed butler in ""The Remains of the Day"" though Sajaans repression seems reversible and his fate hasnt been sealed; he may or may not find his inamorata in the end. ENLARGE Irrfan Khan as Saajan in The Lunchbox Sony Pictures Classics For the acting alone ""The Lunchbox"" is a sumptuous treat. Ms. Kaur as Ila is as nuanced as she is beautiful. Shes also deliciously funny as she cooks in her small kitchen while consulting her unseen auntie who lives upstairs and uses a little basket on a string to lower crucial ingredients to Ilas window. Nawazuddin Siddiqui transforms Shaikh Saajans young colleague and imminently his successor from a servile worm into a person of volatile anger and solid consequence. And through it all moves the marvelous Irrfan Khan. One of the finest actors of our time and blessed with a voice that can turn any of the languages he speaks into music Mr. Khan is the films heart and soul as he reads aloud Saajans notes of longing. ""I think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to"" he writes to Ila. Luckily for them and for us the two have memorable things to tell. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE Darkman (1990) Liam Neeson is Peyton Westlake a disfigured scientific genius who becomes the tormented antihero of the title. (One torment comes from his synthetic skin which can withstand only brief moments in sunlight.) The director Sam Raimi is best known for his three Spider-Man extravaganzas. But hes best-loved among fans of the horror genre for his elegant and witty work in the trilogy that began in 1981 with ""The Evil Dead"" and included ""Evil Dead II"" (1987) and ""Army of Darkness"" (1992). The cast includes Frances McDormand as Julie Hastings Westlakes old love. ENLARGE The Namesake (2006) Irffan Khan is Ashoke a man of extraordinary kindness and tenderness in Mira Nairs screen version of the debut novel of the same name by Jhumpa Lahiri. After an arranged marriage a pair of almost perfect strangers Ashoke Ganguli and his bride Ashima (the Indian film star Tabu) fly off to the U.S. There they struggle to put down roots succeed beyond their hopes and raise an almost thoroughly American son--the namesake of the title--with the singular moniker of Gogol Ganguli. (Hes played by Kal Penn.) The film is immensely pleasurable. ENLARGE Life of Pi (2012) No need to be reminded about Ang Lees film but its yet another showcase for Irrfan Khan. He plays the hero Pi as an adult and uses his mysteriously minimalist talents to weave a climactic spell of ambiguity. On second thought why not be reminded of the gorgeous spectacle of Pis journey in which a man (startlingly young) and a tiger (animated though you wouldnt know it) must work out an armed truce--first out of need then out of unstated respect. The tigers weapons are his teeth and claws; the man has his brain. 15 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"Non-Stop action and cliches review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesNon-Stop action and cliches reviewNon-Stop the latest action film starring Liam Neeson still excites despite being full of cliches and implausibilities.Liam Neeson stars in Non-Stop a suspense thriller played out at 40000 feet in the air.  (Myles Aronowitz)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. Feb. 27 2014Non-StopStarring Liam Neeson Julianne Moore. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. 106 minutes. Opens Feb. 28 at GTA theatres. PG.Fasten your seatbelts. Theres turbulence ahead and a rough landing in the offing.Non-Stop is the kind of action-packed high-altitude thriller/whodunit -- or rather whos-doing-it -- that is sure to please audiences and confound critics and cinephiles who are sticklers for plausible plotting. Article Continued BelowThe film opens with our troubled protagonist federal air marshal Bill Marks sitting in his vehicle prior to takeoff sucking on a cigarette for dear life and nursing a mug of booze he stirs with a toothbrush. If that comes off as tired cliche get used to it theres plenty more where that came from.Non-Stop unabashedly portrays Marks as a man on the edge an unshaven bleary-eyed mess of a human being with a tragedy-tinged past whos about to be tested to the fullest.A very fine character actor Liam Neeson has nicely rebooted his career since Taken became a surprise box office smash in 2008 and found a new niche as an action star. Newly bankable and always watchable Neeson could play this role in his sleep. Yet he manages to keep us rooting for Marks as the odds continue to stack up against him. Marks who also happens to hate flying -- yet another cliche -- is halfway through a flight from New York to London when a mysterious texter threatens to start killing someone every 20 minutes unless a 150 million ransom is paid to a numbered account. It gets worse for Marks as passengers and crew became increasingly convinced hes becoming unhinged and the unknown plotters scheme gets exponentially more deadly. From here director Jaume Collet-Serra accelerates the pace and builds the suspense to dizzying heights aided by a script filled with twists and turns and red herrings aplenty.Collet-Serra has brought together a solid cast including Julianne Moore as Jen who plays Marks enigmatic seatmate with her trademark breezy aplomb along with great supporting work from Michelle Dockery as flight attendant Nancy Corey Stoll as an alpha male cop Scoot McNairy as a much-abused passenger and Omar Metwally as an anxious but sympathetic Muslim doctor.""Youre letting that guy into the cockpit?"" asks one incredulous passenger in a cringeworthy moment referring to the doctor whose headwear and skin colour delineate him as a target of suspicion.The story is dotted with moments of LOL levity including a couple of randy Mile High clubbers the stone-faced Asian passenger who pretends not to speak English so he doesnt have to switch seats and Marks clever method of sneaking a butt in the planes lavatory.With three writing credits (never a good sign) the script occasionally strays into the maudlin as in the unaccompanied 8-year-old waif whos certain to encounter danger a sentimental ribbon and Marks own back story.Jet lag surely awaits those who decide in the aftermath to dissect the film for its many Brobdingnagian plot implausibilities. But for the rest of us theres enough action suspense and unexpected plot twists to give Non-Stop a solid high-five.

Non-Stop By Peter Travers February 27 2014 More News 2013s Best Movies All Stories >> Ok whos kidding who? This tense terrific thriller starring Liam Neeson as Bill Marks a boozy U.S. air marshal coping with a terrorist on a transatlantic flight from New York to London isnt new. Its ""Taken"" on a Plane. Accept that and youll have a high old time. More News 2013s Best Movies All Stories >> Neeson could play this paycheck stuff in his sleep but he gives it something extra. Marks has skeletons in his closet family affairs he hasnt managed to put in order. Hes an emotional basket case. But when the former NYPD cop takes his seat on this 767 he gets a wake-up call. Its in the form of a text message from - yikes - someone on board demanding that 150 million be transferred to a secret account or a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes. The threat is serious. You can tell by the bodies that pile up. Credit Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra who worked effectively with Neeson on Unknown for keeping your nerves in a vise even while juggling the trite contrivances in the script by John W. Richardson Chris Roach and Ryan Engle. Yes it took three writers to line up the usual suspects. Luckily Non-Stop has a way-above-average cast for this kind of nonsense. Julianne Moore as a passenger sitting next to Marks looks trustworthy. Or does she? Its that kind of movie. Corey Stoll late of House of Cards on Netflix plays a New York cop who seems a natural ally for Marks. Or is he? You get my point. Its fun to see Oscar favorite Lupita Nyongo (12 Years a Slave) as a flight attendant. But youll miss her if you blink. Someone screwed up on that one. They do better with Michelle Dockery Lady Mary on Downton Abbey who shares flight-attendant duty but gets more screen time as she grows suspicious of Marks. To avoid spoilers Im shutting up. I will say that until a preposterous ending that tries to turn a popcorn movie profound by making it topical Non-Stop gets the job done.

Universal Pictures photo Myles Aronowitz This image released by Universal Pictures shows Nate Parker left and Julianne Moore in a scene from ""Non-Stop."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Myles Aronowitz) Ive never spoken this fuzzy phrase in conversation let alone written it in a movie review but it applies perfectly to the formulaic action flick ""Non-Stop"" It is what it is.If youve already seen an ad or trailer for the film -- and chances are you have --you shouldnt expect any artful deviations from the premise. World-weary U.S. air marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is on an overseas jetliner when a text-messaging terrorist threatens to kill one passenger every 20 minutes unless a jumbo ransom is paid. So the movie boils down to deducing the identity of the villain and (secondarily) defusing the threat. Thus we spend at least an hour trying the spot the perp on a plane with 150 passengers.Is it the studious Arab gentleman (Omar Metwally)? The weasel on his way to Amsterdam (Scoot McNairy)? The flight attendant (Michelle Dockery) whos worried about Bills drinking? The seatmate who asks too many personal questions (Julianne Moore)? Surely its not the solo-traveling tot (Quinn McColgan).Maybe this is like a ""Twilight Zone"" episode and the devil turns out to be Bills own alter ego. After all he directly causes the death of at least one passenger and the offshore bank account for the ransom money is -- gasp -- registered in Bills name.Dont hold your breath. A movie like this has very narrow parameters -- literally and figuratively. All of the action takes place in an aluminum tube flying over the ocean. Bill tries every trick at his disposal to flush out the felon from discreet eavesdropping to armed searches of the increasingly panicked passengers. Much of the ""action"" entails text messages magnified on the screen. When that becomes tedious a bomb gets added to the mix. Although the in-flight televisions tell us that a worldwide news audience thinks Bill is a terrorist the film is claustrophobic by design.On a figurative level theres never the remotest possibility that director Jaume Collet-Serra will steer in a new direction. Its a sturdy vehicle but if youre looking to book a ticket to uncharted territory ""Non-Stop"" is a non-starter.What ""Non-Stop""  Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 143  Content Intense sequences of action and violence language some sensuality and drug references Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Myles Aronowitz) Photo Myles Aronowitz Associated Press Non-Stop review Liam Neeson action formula takes flight 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Non-Stop Action. Starring Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore. Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. (PG-13. 106 minutes.) The good news to take from ""Non-Stop"" is that the Liam Neeson action formula is strong enough to survive a ridiculous script. Since ""Taken"" in 2009 Neeson has been on a roll of action films whose success is directly tied to Neesons particular set of skills. His earnestness lends depth to drama even as his absolute blind conviction injects a touch of unintended humor. He is convincing in an action context and big enough to do serious damage and yet theres always something about him that makes it seem like this time Dad has really gone crazy. Neeson brings these qualities to bear in ""Non-Stop"" and he makes the film enjoyable even if youre rolling your eyes and laughing in all the wrong places. Maybe theyre the right places. Maybe ""Non-Stop"" is a comedy with Neeson cast as both the comic and his own straight man. Preflight drink He plays an air marshal who sits outside the airport drinking whiskey in his car - this is how he prepares for an intercontinental flight to London. One look at him and we understand. This is a troubled soul a man with a past but a decent guy. We also know something our hero doesnt know. He is in for a long night. At first its the usual trans-Atlantic experience. He waits for the seat belt sign to go off then smokes in the bathroom having first disabled the smoke alarms. But then the text messages start coming in on his secure government line. Someone on the plane - someone really really crazy - wants 150 million transferred to a Swiss bank account. And if he doesnt get it? Well then hes going to start killing the passengers one every 20 minutes. ""Non-Stop"" pits Neeson up against an unseen enemy within a contained space and for a little while this seems like a good idea. We see him - or I suppose we should say his character Bill Marks - trying to stay calm but stalking about like a caged animal. But ""Non-Stop"" fails to build on the situation. It can only extend it by relying too much on coincidence. Gradually the drama deflates from the protagonists having no overt enemy though like the plane the movie stays uneasily aloft from incident to incident. Heres one ongoing source of amusement If youve ever been on a plane particularly on a trans-Atlantic night flight imagine how disturbing it would be to share a space with this air marshal. Irrational requests Every 20 minutes he busts into coach with some new irrational request. First he announces random searches. Then he closes off business class and forces the business passengers into coach. At one point he says ""I need every passenger to raise their hands over their head and keep them there for 60 seconds"" What makes all this even crazier is that he manhandles the passengers and that he sounds as Neeson often does like a nervous wreck. His voice compresses into a growl and one look at him would convince anybody that the plane is going down. Oh yeah and you havent lived until youve watched his monologue in which he tries to win the passengers to his side. In a moment of colossal over-sharing he blurts out ""Im an alcoholic"" - with all the anguish and passion he can muster. Or perhaps its comic timing and Neeson is laughing at us. Julianne Moore plays a fellow passenger who for some vague dim reason is charmed by the air marshals bizarre behavior. Talk about a man shortage. Then again why should she make sense when nothing else does including the terrorists motives? ""Non-Stop"" is one of those silly thrillers where the more you find out the more ludicrous it gets. But just to be clear This is not a negative review. Neeson is too fun to watch. He makes us believe that he believes the unbelievable until the whole thing becomes a perverse pleasure. Thanks to him I not only enjoyed ""Non-Stop"" but Id watch it again. Particularly on a plane. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday February 27 2014 1200 PM Title Non-Stop Film Info PG-13 Violence language airplane trauma. Area theaters. Theres an enjoyable go-for-broke bullishness in ""Non-Stop"" that echoes its star Liam Neeson. Just as the 61-year-old actor keeps churning out (sometimes subpar) action flicks so this movie breaks you down with obvious conceits and popcorn-flick tension. Surprisingly ""Non-Stop"" works -- by dint of tenacity and muscle. Neeson plays Bill Marks a jittery federal air marshal first seen pouring alcohol into a coffee cup. He then thunders through security and barks into his phone that he shouldnt be back at work after a to-be-revealed family issue. Lupita Nyongo (Oscar nominee for ""12 Years a Slave"") plays a stewardess in ""Non-Stop."" Then Marks receives texts in the sky from a mysterious sender. The person taunts Marks knows of his past -- and warns that one person will be killed every 20 minutes as the plane theyre on jets from New York to London. Marks alerts the crew and his superiors on the ground. He confides in the redhead (Julianne Moore adding quirk to a nothing role) seated next to him. Theres a second air marshal on the flight shadowing Marks. Nobody believes him when he says whats happening. Is it all in his head? By the time a bomb is found everyone even Marks is a suspect. Julianne Moore adds a quirky quality to her role as the heros seat mate in ""Non-Stop."" ""Non-Stop"" loses points for lack of originality. The structure seems like a holdover from 25 years ago. Back when movie studio execs thought they could transplant claustrophobic action to different locales. ""Lets make Die Hard on a plane Die Hard on a bus Die Hard on a junglegym"" This film needed a more confident filmmaking hand someone to replicate the sleekness Jan de Bont brought to ""Speed"" or Wolfgang Petersen provided in ""Air Force One."" Jaume Collet-Serra director of ""Unknown"" -- one of Neesons better thrillers -- highlights the whodunit quality of the often clumpy script. (Theres even a nod to an Agatha Christie novel ""Death in the Air."") Collet-Serra tries to ramp up the tension by showing the threatening texts onscreen and referencing 9/11 but it all comes down to who the villain is -- the surly bald guy? That Aaron Sorkin-looking guy? The Middle Eastern doctor? A barely glimpsed stewardess (""12 Years a Slave"" Oscar nominee Lupita Nyongo)? Michelle Dockery of ""Downtown Abbey"" enters the 21st century in ""Non-Stop."" Neeson drags things back to reality. The movie is a minor tour de force for the fightin Irish thespian as he sweats calculates and rushes down aisles to rough people up indiscriminately. The small confines suit his physicality. Hes at least two heads taller than everyone so when angry its like an orangey Bigfoot is on your flight. That doesnt mean ""Non-Stop"" is as towering a success as ""The Grey"" the best of Neesons late-career pulse-racers. But its also not as one-note as ""Taken 2."" This one takes flight almost by accident and the best twist is how Neesons growly presence makes a bumpy ride enjoyable. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it Liam Neeson plays an air marshal on an international flight who tries to save passengers threatened by a murderous scheme in ""Non-Stop."" (Myles Aronowitz) By Michael OSullivan February 27 2014 ""Non-Stop"" is by no means a perfect movie. Made for the multiplex its a middlebrow murder mystery with a lot of ""Airport"" DNA in its genes. Still Liam Neeson lends the effort a gravitas that makes it at least by the standards of gimmicky thrillers a perfectly entertaining antidote to all the Important Films that have been filling up your pre-Oscar-night to-do list. The gimmick in this case is that the movie is an old-fashioned Agatha Christie novel set on an airplane. With obvious correlations to such classics of detective fiction as ""And Then There Were None"" and ""Murder on the Orient Express"" the film tells the story of an air marshal (Neeson) who must identify and thwart a passenger who is threatening by text message to kill one person on the plane every 20 minutes unless he receives 150 million. As with Christies most famous works most of the main characters including Neesons Bill Marks a troubled alcoholic initially draw our suspicion. The characters are either too cooperative not cooperative enough weirdly furtive excessively flirty hiding a dark secret or in the zeitgeist-y case of one Middle Eastern-looking character (Omar Metwally) simply presumed to be guilty by ethnicity. Of course almost all of the suspects will eventually be proved innocent -- several of them as you might have guessed by dying. It works well enough even if the movie -- directed by Jaume Collet-Serra from a screenplay by John W. Richardson Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle -- leans heavily on cliche. ""Non-Stop"" opens with a scene of a bleary-eyed Bill sitting sadly in his rain-streaked car stirring a splash of whiskey into his coffee with a toothbrush as he touches a dog-eared photo of his absent family. Wow. Thats a lot of back story to get out of the way in only 10 seconds but the movie doesnt have time to waste. Mere minutes into his six-hour flight to London Bill is dealing with the first of several corpses to crop up in a closed aircraft hurtling across the ocean at 500 mph. The extortion attempt -- more killings will follow unless Bill manages to get a ransom transferred to a numbered bank account that turns out to be in his name -- is carried out via an exchange of text messages that pop up onscreen like little cartoon speech bubbles. Its annoying at first but youll get used to it. (Youd better. I suspect that more and more films will like the recent ""Fruitvale Station"" start to incorporate texting into their dialogue. Get ready for the first case where a movie catchphrase like ""Hasta la vista baby"" comes accompanied by a cellphone alert tone.) There are a number of plot twists and turns the most satisfying of which have to do with wireless technology. Because the sender of the threatening messages appears to be someone on the plane Bills detective work largely involves finding a person who is using a cellphone in the cabin. That is easier said than done and it gives the movie which is otherwise premised on the creakiest of concepts -- the so-called ""locked-room mystery"" -- a fresh contemporary feeling. Collet-Serra who directed Neeson in ""Unknown"" has a knack for keeping things lively and moving forward. There are moments of humor gripping action and real terror. The cast -- which like the ""Airport"" movies includes an old lady a little girl and an assortment of other disaster-movie ""types"" -- is bolstered by a nuanced performance by Julianne Moore as Bills more than slightly suspicious seatmate as well as believable turns by many less-well-known supporting players. But its the propulsive pace of the film and the nice sense of suspense it builds that help most in glossing over its failings. In addition to a series of preposterous plot coincidences that in hindsight strain even generous credulity the films flaws include a motive that is ultimately revealed in what may be the most torturously reasoned politically themed speech ever delivered by a mad criminal mastermind at the climax of a movie. My response to hearing it was essentially the same as Bills. ""You should have just handed out pamphlets"" he tells the murderer. ""It would have been a lot easier."" Thats certainly true but the movie would have been a lot less fun.   1/2 PG-13. At area theaters.

Liam Neeson also known as Mr. Capable or Uncle Avuncular is back headlining another entertainingly preposterous thriller this one called ""Non-Stop"" directed by his ""Unknown"" collaborator director Jaume Collet-Serra.I can take or leave the ""Taken"" movies which are so very very profitable around the world but thanks to films such as ""Unknown"" ""The Grey"" and now ""Non-Stop"" Neeson in the bleak midwinter has become as much of a tradition as Groundhog Day. When the new year refuses to inch out of the deep freeze theres nothing like the warm reassuring sound of Neesons voice. Or the warm reassuring sight of Neeson besting a bad guy or a bad wolf. ""Non-Stop"" confines its action almost entirely to the inside of a trans-Atlantic New York-to-London flight. A fast efficient introduction lays the groundwork Federal air marshal Bill Marks the Neeson character is a nervous flier an alcoholic ex-cop who looks as though hes carrying around a suitcase of unresolved issues. His seatmate played by the overqualified Julianne Moore sees in Bill a man in need of some comfort and conversation. But is she hiding something? Director Collet-Serras cutaway shots appear to indicate as much.But this is a whodunit or the present-tense variation on the whodunit the whosdoingit. Marks receives a text midflight from someone demanding 150 million in wired funds or else the terrorist will begin killing one passenger per 20 minutes. Ticking clock Whos going to look after the sweet scared little preteen girl whos flying alone for the first time? And why does every actor with a speaking role in ""Non-Stop"" appear to be a shifty-eyed potential killer? Because its a requirement of the genre thats why. The ""Non-Stop"" script credited to John W. Richardson Chris Roach and Ryan Engle creates a hint of a past romance for Marks and one of the flight attendants (Michelle Dockery of ""Downton Abbey""). Another flight attendant a late crew addition played by Lupita Nyongo of ""12 Years a Slave"" darts in and out of the action just enough to create more free-floating suspicion. And there are a dozen more just like her red herrings (or are they?) designed to keep the fishing expedition worth our time.Train travels really my thing especially cinematically but ever since Agatha Christie killed someone off with an apparent bee sting in her 1935 novel ""Death in the Air"" (also known as ""Death in the Clouds"") writers and directors have been eager to re-book flights to the local movie screen. Recently director Wes Craven worked creative variations on claustrophobic thrills in ""Red Eye""; ""Flightplan"" less successfully embarked on guessing games aboard a jumbo jetliner in peril.""Non-Stop"" goes crazy near the end of course. Neesons air marshal as we see in the trailers at one point grabs a floating gun in slow motion and fires it at ... who? Cant say. I can say that Neeson has a wonderful knack for the simple grounded line reading and carefully delineated streaks of anger and doubt. Director Collet-Serra embraces the premise without treating it as a joke. The revelation of whosdoingit and why is accompanied by a pretty lumpy lump of exposition. But soon enough then theres a plane to land and that part is ridiculous but exciting.The movies fun. And now thanks to our annual Neeson thriller spring can come soon. ""Non-Stop"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of action and violence some language sexuality and drug references)Running time 147Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Liam Neeson Unknown (movie) The Grey (movie) Lupita Nyongo Downton Abbey Latest movie reviews REVIEW Kids for Cash  1/2 REVIEW Stalingrad  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/ct-non-stop-movie-review-20140227,0,239283.column",200,non-stop25,non-stop,chicagotribune

Share Tweet Part locked-room mystery part political allegory Non-Stop is one of the most purely enjoyable entries in the ongoing cycle of Liam Neeson action-thrillers tempering the stars gruff strongman antics with surveillance-state commentary thats more clever than subversive. Set almost entirely aboard a red-eye JFK-to-Heathrow flight the movie stars Neeson as Bill Marks an Irish-born U.S. air marshal who is framed for hijacking the plane by an unknown criminal mastermind presumed to be lurking among the passengers. Rather than try to cheat his way out of this constrained premise director Jaume Collet-Serra (who previously directed Neeson in the chase mystery Unknown) makes the most of it using the absence of an exterior point of view to build suspense.Working with cinematographer Flavio Labiano (The Day Of The Beast Timecrimes) Collet-Serra continually crisscrosses the interior of the plane--seemingly modeled on a Virgin Atlantic flight and lit hazy purple--with long handheld takes and down-the-aisle dolly shots. Marks inability to see what all of the other characters are doing contributes to the tension; the layout and seating arrangements of the plane are the plot. In one of the few instances in which the viewers perspective is separated from Marks a complex CGI shot creates the illusion of the camera seamlessly dollying out of a window in first class and then dollying into one at the back of coach; this effectively maps the plane and underscores the way in which its compartments and dividers create visual obstructions.On-screen word balloons have become film and TVs go-to method for depicting text messages and since Marks can only communicate with the real hijacker through texting Non-Stop is chock full of them. Collet-Serra has the time of his life with this visual device distorting the text when Marks tries to read it during a period of turbulence or taking it out of focus when he looks away from his phone. Like most of the films characterizations and plot points the word balloons represent a familiar trope; what distinguishes them--and the movie--is that theyre being applied creatively.  The script--by newcomers Chris Roach John W. Richardson and Ryan Engle--posits Marks cat-and-mouse game with the texter as a kind of mini War On Terror with Marks standing in for his federal employers the texter as the undefined exterior threat (whose actual motives turn out to be extremely corny) and the passengers as the public caught in between. Crucial to the movie is the contrast between the way in which Marks conforms to an image of scowling leadership and his lack of efficacy. He makes critical mistakes and lies about them to the passengers and crew. He conducts searches that lead nowhere. His alcoholism is an open secret in the service. Simply put hes a fuck-up who inspires confidence only because he looks and sounds exactly like Liam Neeson.Suspicion and secrecy are a key part of both thrillers and counter-terrorism narratives. Non-Stops tweak is to present them as impediments to the solution of the central mystery. Counterintuitive as they may seem transparency a willingness to be criticized and a basic level of trust in everyone--despite knowing that one of them has to be the bad guy--end up winning the day. As much as Marks may look like the spitting image of a solo hero its only when he begins to work as a specialized member of a larger group that he becomes effective.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details we cant reveal in this review visit Non-Stops Spoiler Space.

Photo Myles Aronowitz/Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Non-Stop Running time 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sanitized violence profanity drugs). At the Chelsea the Beekman the Union Square others. All the tedium of an endless trans-Atlantic flight gets packed into the 105 minutes of ""Non-Stop a preposterous ""thriller providing Oscar nominee-turned action star Liam Neeson with his latest paycheck job. Roughly 80 percent of this snoozer consists of Neeson as alcoholic federal air marshal Bill Marks trading less-than-scintillating text messages (""WHO ARE YOU? ""WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?) with an unknown culprit -- who threatens to start killing passengers unless 150 million is transferred into an offshore account. Among the many nonsensical twists are that the account turns out to be in Marks name and our hero is tricked into killing another sky marshal traveling onboard for no seemingly plausible reason except that the screenwriters needed this to happen. So at the same time Marks is madly texting and checking passengers cellphones for the other end of his conversation hes being relieved of duty by a superior on the ground who believes Marks has hijacked the JFK-to-London flight -- even though the idea of Marks knowingly providing an incriminating bank account in his own name beggars the imagination. A crew member whos foaming at the mouth dies while Marks is roughing up a number of passengers who serve as red herrings including a somewhat bored-looking Julianne Moore the films female lead as well as the burly Corey Stoll from ""House of Cards. Liam Neeson and Michelle Dockery in ""Non-Stop.""Photo Myles Aronowitz/Universal Pictures But the framed Marks who has an on-and-off alliance with the chief flight attendant (Michelle Dockery of ""Downtown Abbey looking sharp in a thankless role) still manages to take control even when he isnt waving a service revolver around the cabin (not recommended behavior). At one especially hilarious point Marks commands rebellious passengers to sit down by promising them a years worth of free trans-Atlantic flights. After all this is an airline where they somehow can watch Pat Kiernans breathless live report from NY1 on Marks seemingly criminal behavior in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. And this is the kind of movie where when the villain is finally unmasked the culprits motives make no sense whatsoever. At least to me. Feel free to text if you manage to figure this out. Heck the writers cant even decide whether air marshals need to go through TSA screening or not at the airport. But they havent miss a cliche including the little girl flying unaccompanied on her first flight and the Arab-looking gentleman who turns out to be heroic. Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson in ""Non-Stop.""Photo Myles Aronowitz/Universal Pictures Oh and the concerned-looking black flight attendant -- played by Oscar nominee Lupita Nyongo (""12 Years a Slave) who has maybe half a dozen lines of dialogue altogether. There is relatively little action -- at least until the endless text messages finally give way to an equally hoary plot device beloved by hack writers of contemporary thrillers the bomb with a digital readout. Im not giving away anything that isnt in a trailer that reveals a whole lot more -- including just how cheesy the special effects are in the laughable climactic sequence which defies the laws of logic as well as physics. Even Neesons acting chops cant make a silk purse out of this sows ear whose particulars make little sense even in a fantasy context. And his characters back story which includes a dead child and being fired from the NYPD at an age when he should be retired doesnt help. Neeson receives little help from Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra who did better by the star in the plausibility-challenged but far more exciting ""Unknown. ""Non-Stop could be dismissed off as just another witless aerial thriller if there werent numerous tasteless references to 9/11 -- including threats to shoot the jetliner down over Iceland and a runaway beverage cart straight out of ""United 93.

Credit Myles Aronowitz In theaters Friday Feb. 28. 2 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars) Early on in this thriller the captain of an aircraft dismisses a potential terrorist threat by telling Liam Neesons concerned air marshal to simply ""sit back relax and enjoy the flight."" The line is a groaner -- not just because the impending doom is obvious to anyone with a single brain cell but Neeson doesnt do Zen. PHOTOS Celebrities and their stunt doubles Indeed the strapping Irish thespian has made an impressive second career out of playing the intellectual action hero. Mess with him and start planning your own funeral. (This applies to animals too. See The Grey). Yet the original Taken aside Neeson has yet to find the ideal vehicle to match his very specific set of acting skills. And with Non-Stop he must once again carry a generic outing on his weary shoulders. PHOTOS Stars as super heroes A chain-smoking alcoholic undercover officer Neeson is sitting antsy in first class when he receives an ominous text A passenger is going to die every 20 minutes until 150 million is wired into a bank account. (The texts are displayed on screen in big bubbles and typed with an auto-correct. At least someone cares about proper spelling at 40000 feet). After a quick walk up-and-down the aisles and a chat with the TSA higher-ups he gets more dire news Turns out that the account is in his name making him suspect No. 1. PHOTOS Celebrity injuries Its a tantalizing premise leading to steady waves of whodunit tension. Any of the 150-plus passengers and crew could be the anonymous evil mastermind including the red-headed passenger (Julianne Moore fab as always) next to him who pleaded hard for that coveted window seat. Moviegoers playing along might also eye the vaguely suspicious handsome young co-pilot because he has an accent and a secret. PHOTOS Celebrities crying The fun finger pointing however is marred by illogical head-scratchers. Surely a suitcase full of cocaine would never end up in the overhead compartment no matter who brought it onboard. Somehow this ties into an extortion subplot and a dead body in the bathroom. (And yet the captain still doesnt take Neesons warning seriously and turn the London-bound aircraft around) PHOTOS Julianne and Hollywoods red hot redheads Meanwhile the flick features every airplane disaster cliche this side of Airplane Bad enough that our favorite air marshal deals with turbulence that strikes at the most inconvenient moments; must he also soothe the Smarmy Bigot Unruly Punk Scared Stewardess and Angelic Child Flying By Herself? When a crewmember is predictably rubbed out one half-expects Otto Pilot to inflate. With such a bumpy descent better make sure that movie ticket isnt non-refundable.

He draws plenty of wary eyes as he walks through the airport to catch a flight to the U.K. but not from the TSA agents who barely give him a glance. Thats because this towering sad sack is a federal air marshal the one assigned to guard the plane. You surely know where this delightfully trashy thriller is headed and director Jaume Collet-Serra who previously worked with Neeson on the amnesiac Euro-thriller Unknown (2011) doesnt waste time with the getting-to-know-yous. No sooner has Marks settled beside inquisitive seatmate Jen (Julianne Moore having a blast) than he gets a series of texts from a mystery terrorist who promises to kill a passenger every 20 minutes until they receive 150 million. The setup is dynamite and the follow-through entertainingly dumb as long as the film keeps the unseen villain and his/her motivations in the dark. Its a pleasure to watch Neeson work an alcohol-addled variation on the imposing asskicker hes cultivated since 2008s Taken. Marks has a very particular set of skills that leaves plenty of necks and noses broken but he also has a hard-luck backstory (confessed in a grin-inducing scene that manages to be both silly and sublime) giving him just the right amount of gravitas. Collet-Serra fills the souls-on-board manifest with a variety of eclectic faces--everyone from 12 Years a Slaves Lupita Nyongo to increasingly ubiquitous character actor Corey Stoll. He also makes terrific use of his set deftly rendering close-quarters smackdowns and several expertly executed one-shots. Would that the climax lived up to the tension-filled first two thirds. Lets just say that Non-Stop reaches for some pointed post-9/11 political commentary that almost entirely exceeds its grasp. Total brainlessness in this case would have been a virtue.

The writing is so bad as to be insulting and the whole thing is put together in such an unexciting boring and perfunctory way that you have to wonder who would pay 13 o more bucks to see something that doesnt remotely approach the craft and entertainment value of any episode in the worst lamest tv series out there. The filmmakers behind this piece of pallid uninteresting hackwork prove themselves to be lucky to be employed. It is not that this is bad it is that is so profoundly mediocre that you dont really see the point on why this movie was made or who wants to pay money and waste time watching it when theres so much good stuff out there on cable network tv o even netflix. Stay at home and watch House of Cards or any other series that is light years ahead of this dreck.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map },http://www.timeout.com/us/film/non-stop,200,non-stop30,non-stop,timeout

And one without a lot of action or thrills at that. But no theres no rescuing ""Non-Stop"" from its own worse impulses. The likable Neesons implausible second act as an action star continues but not in a believable direction. Neeson plays Bill Marks a federal air marshal who prepares for his flight by pouring booze into a cup and stirring it with a toothbrush. If thats not movie code for down-and-out what is? He also looks wanly at a picture of a young girl which also raises red flags. Then he has a few smokes and boards a plane leaving New York for London. He winds up seated beside a high-maintenance woman named Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) who insists on having a window seat. Once theyre in the air Marks gets a series of text messages explaining that if he doesnt have 150 million wired into a bank account immediately a passenger will die in 20 minutes. And the hunt is on. Several twists follow that wont be revealed here in part because it would give too much away and in part because too many of them dont make any sense so you wouldnt believe them anyway. Collet-Serra at times makes good use of the claustrophobic setting -- most of the film takes place inside the plane and a good bit of it inside the planes bathroom including a particularly nasty fight scene. But its easy to look past that when Marks increasingly desperate actions are met with nothing more than a worried shrug from the passengers for the longest time. Marks is assisted somewhat in his efforts to find the culprit by Nancy (Michelle Dockery who ""Downton Abbey"" fans will recognize as Lady Mary) a flight attendant. Lupita Nyongo Oscar-nominated for ""12 Years a Slave"" also plays a flight attendant but her timing is poor Youre supposed to wait till after youve won an Academy Award to take a string of thankless roles. Moore is intriguing as the spunky somewhat-mysterious Summers but theres not really much for her to do beyond set a couple of plot machinations in motion. Other folks come and go but events transpire in such a way that Marks is really left to do most of the work on his own. His back is against the wall no one trusts him he has nothing to lose etc. etc. And really isnt that how we like Neeson as an action hero be it in ""Taken"" or ""The Grey?"" Sure. But we also like him in movies that make a little more sense. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

Unless of course your name happens to be Liam Neeson. Back in 2009 at the ripe age of 56 the Irish actor pulled off one of the most unlikely career overhauls in years by starring in the ruthless relentless revenge flick Taken. With one indelible threat growled into a cell phone at the Albanian goons who made the mistake of kidnapping his daughter Neeson proved that he was more than just a stoic Oscar-nominated leading man. That beneath all the prestige-film trappings lay the beating heart of an unapologetic B-movie badass. For the most part audiences have made out like bandits from this makeover. Neesons imposing 64"" frame haunted eyes and knack for snapping limbs like clery stalks have elevated throwaways such as Unknown The Grey and Taken 2 into something more than the sum of their parts. They may not all be memorable films but theyd be utterly forgettable without the high-gloss patina of a class that he gives them. The actors latest genre-film gambit is Non-Stop -- a tense but ludicrous cat-and-mouse thriller at 30000 feet. Neeson plays Bill Marks a grieving alcoholic air marshal on board a transatlantic flight to London. His soul is still stinging from the death of his young daughter but right from the get-go we see that hes good at his job as he sizes up the boarding passengers looking for the tells and tics of potential danger. Is his frazzled business-class seatmate (Julianne Moore) as harmless as she seems? Is the Muslim doctor (Omar Metwally) a little too on-the-nose as a possible terrorist? What about the beady-eyed guy (Corey Stoll) sweating back in coach? Or the other air marshal on board (Anson Mount) who calls Bill a paranoid drunk? And is the flight attendant (Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery) to be trusted? These doubts may seem like the figments of Bills pickled imagination. But when he receives a series of taunting texts threatening to kill one passenger every 20 minutes unless he can persuade his superiors to wire 150 million to an offshore bank account his suspicions bear out. As a rule airplanes make deviously effective settings for trashy mayhem. And the list of high-altitude nail-biters is as long as the security line at LAX Passenger 57 Air Force One Executive Decision Turbulence -- and who could forget Snakes on a Plane? Non-Stop isnt significantly better than any of those films; its twist-a-minute script is patently ridiculous and its appeals to our post-9/11 anxieties are as subtle as a jackhammer. But once again Neeson is a straight-faced secret weapon. With his lions roar and can-do fists he grounds the films more preposterous moments and makes them feel excitingly tense. At a certain point either youll fasten your seat belt and go with Non-Stops absurd Looney Tunes logic or you wont. Against my better judgment I went with it. After all Neeson has shown time and again that hes the closest thing Hollywood has these days to a box office Rumpelstiltskin. He can spin cheese into gold.

Daily Edition Login to download Non-Stop Film Review 922 AM PST 2/26/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS The implausibilities outnumber the dead bodies in this airborne Liam Neeson thriller. TWITTER Joel Silver makes his debut as a Universal producer in the thriller that reunites Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra. A constant low boil of ridiculousness both mocks and sustains Non-Stop a jerry-rigged terror-on-a-plane thriller with a premise so far-fetched as to create a degree of suspense over how the writers will wriggle out of the knot of their own making. With a setup and dramatic rationale more strange than compelling this almost entirely airborne concoction is an easy sell as this seasons Liam Neeson kick-ass action entry meaning that Joel Silvers debut as a Universal producer after his long tenure at Warner Bros. looks to land in a safe haven commercially. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies X-Men Days of Future Past Mockingjay Spider-Man 2 Neither as gritty and cheesy as his Taken movies nor as deadly serious as The Grey this reunion of Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra (their 2011 thriller Unknown raked in 130 million worldwide) no doubt deliberately recycles aspects of the Taken films by making the lead character a wild-card government lawman with a young daughter. In addition to that Federal Air Marshal Bill Marks is an alcoholic and something of an emotional wreck but is still allowed to pack a pistol on a plane. Riding shotgun on this Aquabritish flight from New York to London Bill takes the opportunity to enjoy business class and the company of chatty seatmate Jen (Julianne Moore) but is interrupted in short order by a series of text messages evidently from someone on board warning that a passenger will be killed unless Bill arranges for 150 million to be deposited into a certain account within 20 minutes. Someone does duly expire and another after that and the trick card played by first-time screenwriters John W. Richardson Chris Roach and Ryan Engle is that the accumulating deaths point the finger of guilt directly at Bill whos supposedly on board to protect the passengers from any such culprit. With the clock ticking away Bill with the reluctant help of a flight attendant (Michelle Dockery) and Moores well-traveled professional urgently tries to profile the passengers to narrow down his list of suspects Theres the surly bald man the obvious Muslim an unfriendly black guy a weirdo with glasses and a few more. Whoever it is he knows something about Bill and definitely knows how to yank his chain. VIDEO Non-Stop Trailer Liam Neeson Is a U.S. Air Marshal on a Hijacked Plane Although he was a cop for 25 years Bill doesnt exactly fit the ideal profile for an air marshal; he hates flying is so panicky during takeoff that he wraps a good-luck ribbon around his hand and sneaks smokes in the bathroom (he knows how to block the alarm sensor). The pilots dont seem to entirely trust him and after he pummels the first suspect to death (he sort of deserves it) you suspect he doesnt know his own strength and cant control himself. How he then manages to prevent anyone else from noticing the body is just one of the many inconvenient issues Collet-Serra nimbly deals with by ignoring it. As the implausibilities continue to accumulate you feel the strain the screenwriters must have felt in trying to come up with the periodic action the format demands while keeping the villainous texters identity a secret. As he continues to receive messages from someone on board but fails to deduce whos sending them Bill moves passengers around the cabin gets very rough with some of them and ignores the seat belt rule through most of the flight. If nothing else the film offers a convincing case for banning cell phone use during flights (and who gets reception over the North Atlantic anyway?). The most interesting development is the eventual mutiny of the passengers against their alleged protector. Television has begun reporting that the flight has been hijacked by none other than its air marshal whos tarred feathered and convicted on the air while hes trying to deal with the bomb hes found on board. Meanwhile two military jets are flying alongside with orders to down the plane if it descends as Bill insists it must. The finale is comparable in nature to the great plane crash sequence in Robert Zemeckis Flight but is not nearly as nerve-rackingly convincing. Given that so many of the 150 people on board come under suspicion at some point the eventual unmasking of the villain or villains is no more or less surprising than if it had been anyone else. But the rationale for the dastardly plot is hokey and thin hardly worthy of the great lengths pursued it pull it off. Looking deliberately grizzled and worse for wear Neeson gives his besieged character all the texture he can; Bill is not a run-of-the-Hollywood-mill tough guy hero who automatically wins respect via his natural movie star authority and is automatically going to save the day; only when under duress he is forced to give an honest self-deprecating speech to the anxious passengers does he win their respect. With the exception of the flight attendants played by Dockery and Lupita Nyongo who has a half-dozen perfunctory lines at best everyone else including Moore primarily has to be good at projecting potential guilt even while seeming just like normal folk.

The Lego Movie Snaps a Bright Colorful Franchise Into Place for Warner Bros. Animation Liam Neeson on 60 Minutes Why The Non-Stop Star Makes All Those Action Movies (Video) In this cheesy but diabolically-entertaining thriller an air marshal struggles to prove hes not a terrorist -- at 20000 feet If as ""The Usual Suspects"" taught us the greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didnt exist its worth pointing out that one of the greatest tricks of ""Non-Stop"" is the villains skill in making the hero look like the bad guy. Its February which means its time to watch Liam Neeson beat the stuffing out of some villains. This time around Neeson plays Bill Marks a tortured boozy air marshal whos being played by a cunning nemesis one whos doing everything possible to make it seem as though Bill is the one whos actually hijacking the plane and not the guy who is really trying to save the day. Watch video Liam Neeson Accidentally Hijacks a Plane in Non-Stop Trailer (Video) The screenplay by first-timers John W. Richardson amp; Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle may bite off more than it can chew but for most of its flight time ""Non-Stop"" is a cheesy delight down to its improbable plot twists and the inevitable appearance of a red LED display showing how long Bill has to rescue passengers and crew before everything goes kablooey. Neeson reteams with director Jaume Collet-Serra for a movie that makes a teensy bit more sense than their previous collaboration ""Unknown"" while amping the excitement and giddy entertainment factor up by 11. Given that the movie is stuck inside the confines of a jet flying from New York to London this is basically a variant on the locked-room/haunted house whodunit with a stealth killer and a suspicious briefcase taking the place of one of Agatha Christies murderous vicars. With a cast this strong however the implausibilities go down easier since Neeson is apparently flying the friendly skies of Character Actor Airlines with lots of red-herring supporting players to keep us suspicious. Could our mystery assailant be one of the flight attendants (played by Michelle Dockery aka Lady Mary of ""Downton Abbey"" and Oscar nominee Lupita Nyongo)? What about the nice lady (Julianne Moore) in First Class with the surgery scar and the kind words for a nervous-about-flying Bill? Maybe its the hot-headed NYPD cop (Corey Stoll) or the babbling tourist (Scoot McNairy) or the brusque business commuter (Nate Parker) or even the grumpy co-pilot (Jason Butler Harner)? The possibilities are seemingly endless which is of no help to Bill since his mysterious antagonist is making good on his threat to kill a passenger every 20 minutes even within the airtight space. Also read Ed Harris in Negotiations to Run All Night With Liam Neeson (Exclusive) After a movie like ""Pompeii"" in which a bunch of cardboard cut-outs get swept up in a sea of lava its refreshing to see a shameless genre movie that at least bothers to write characters (and cast them well) so they make a bare minimum of an impression letting us know who they are (or at least who theyre pretending to be) so they can be active participants in a relatively-complicated plot. The cast does lots of heavy lifting to put everything in place; theres a key speech late in the film that turns the whole movie around and its hard to imagine it working in the hands of anyone who lacks Neesons oratorical skills. Also read Julianne Moore Zach Galifianakis Join Ellen Page in Gay Rights Drama Freeheld There may be a lack of surprise if only because ""Liam Neeson action movie"" has become a formula unto itself and we always know how theyre going to wind up. (Unless hes battling wolves of course but thats another story.) Even with that in mind however ""Non-Stop"" keeps plenty of jolts and surprises in its overhead compartment.

Continuing his prodigious run of duosyllabic Euro-financed action movies Liam Neeson is back with a gun in his hand and a weary grimace on his long Irish mug in ""Non-Stop"" a sometimes inspired mostly serviceable doomed-airliner thriller that reunites its star with ""Unknown"" director Jaume Collet-Serra for another round of pseudo-Hitchcockian hijinks. Lacking anywhere near as clever as script this time Neeson and Collet-Serra put this wronged-man programmer dutifully through its paces with plenty of the gruff machismo and close-quarters grappling that have made the 61-year-old actor a late-career global action star. (Can an ""Expendables"" cameo be far in the future?) Turnstiles should click briskly for this Studiocanal/Joel Silver co-production which opens overseas today 48 hours ahead of its Stateside bow. Its easy to imagine that ""Non-Stop"" was pitched as ""Unknown on an airplane"" with Neeson once again spending most of the running time trying to convince people that he is who he says he is -- in this case the federal air marshal trying to root out a hijacker as opposed to being the hijacker himself. But the script credited to tyro scribes John W. Richardson Chris Roach and Ryan Engle also bears more than a glancing resemblance to 2005s ""Flightplan"" in which Jodie Fosters grieving widow becomes convinced that someone has kidnapped her young daughter in the middle of a transatlantic jumbo-jet flight. There Peter Sarsgaard was the seemingly benevolent air marshal who turned out to be a raging psycho intent on turning the plane into a giant WMD; here someone who perhaps saw that movie is trying to frame Neesons Bill Marks to appear the same way. When we first see Marks sitting in his car outside JFK on a rainy wintry day the bottle of Jim Beam in his hand tells us hes a man with a troubled/tragic past that will inevitably come home to roost somewhere around the movies third act. Collet-Serra then plows through the other scene-setting details in similarly expedient fashion introducing an ""Airport""-worthy cast of passengers that includes a frazzled businesswoman (Julianne Moore) a tough New York cop (Corey Stoll) a thirtysomething slacker dude (Scoot McNairy) a Muslim doctor (Omar Metwally) just waiting to be racially profiled and the de rigueur unaccompanied minor. The only real surprise not a priest or a nun anywhere in sight. By 10 minutes in the movie is airborne and by 15 Marks has received the first in a series of anonymous text messages (sent over the planes secure network) stating that someone on board will be killed every 20 minutes until 150 million is transferred into a designated bank account. In a sure sign of our inflationary times ""Flightplans"" criminal mastermind only asked for a mere 50 million. One of the consistent pleasures of airplane movies at least for frequent flyers lies in seeing the fictional airline names and logos dreamed up by movie production designers along with the simulated aircraft themselves their rows and aisles invariably enlarged to accommodate the cameras passage. (In the movies every seat is an Economy Comfort seat.) Here were on board a British Aqualantic 767 bound for Heathrow and it comes equipped with a crew whose members all too plausibly initially dismiss the threatening messages as a hoax. (They include captain Linus Roache co-pilot Jason Butler Harner and flight attendants Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyongo who has precious little to do in a role she clearly filmed before anyone had seen ""12 Years a Slave."") Then someone dies right on schedule and its Marks who has their blood on his hands. He also it turns out has his name on that aforementioned bank account. From this point forward viewers are best advised to make with their disbelief as one does with oversized cabin baggage Check it at the door. The ultimate revelations about Neesons semi-amnesiac ""Unknown"" character notwithstanding we sense from the start of ""Non-Stop"" that Marks is a good guy whos been set up and for a while the film sustains a reasonably fun game of whodunit as the body count rises and the hair-trigger Marks begins interrogating passengers with a bedside manner that makes ""Takens"" Bryan Mills seem like Florence Nightingale. That even an air marshal could manage to get away with such behavior in an age when commercial airline passengers have bum-rushed and hog-tied flight disruptors for far less violent offenses stretches the movies already elastic sense of plausible reality to the breaking point more than once. But even in the movies most ridiculous moments Collet-Serra keeps the pacing brisk and knows how to divert our attention with a well-timed bit of comic relief. Sensing a potential passenger riot on his hands Marks quells the fire by announcing that Aqualantic is offering everyone free international travel for a full year. A protege of producer Joel Silver the Spanish-born Collet-Serra (who already has a third Neeson pic ""Run All Night"" in the can for next February) is an able-bodied genre craftsman with a love of old-fashioned plot mechanics and an unusual generosity to actors who are afforded more quiet character-revealing moments in his movies than such fare typically allows. By its very design an exercise in claustrophobia ""Non-Stop"" eventually runs out of places to go and builds to a big third-act reveal thats at once so ludicrous and heavy-handed that it sucks all the thrust out of the movies jet engines. Its also the first of Collet-Serras movies in which so many good actors are put to such little use including Moore who like most of her fellow passengers is there mainly to arouse passing suspicion and get roughed up at Neesons hands. But Neeson himself is a compelling presence throughout even if weve now seen him play this sort of lone man of action at least a half-dozen times. Typecasting isnt necessarily a liability if youre an actor with Neesons knack for sauntering through a scene as though his body were weighing heavily on his shoulders and woe be to all who obstruct his path. Its been widely noted how ""unlikely"" it is for the ""Schindlers List"" Oscar nominee to have been reborn close to retirement age as a latter-day Charles Bronson or Clint Eastwood. But its age weariness and disappointment that are precisely Neesons greatest virtues. As he kicks butt onscreen he seems a man hardened by real experience not by hours spent in the gym. Reunited with most of his ""Unknown"" crew Collet-Serra delivers a technically proficient package aided by the moody cabin lighting of d.p. Flavio Labiano and a bassy propulsive John Ottman score.

JJ says February 26 2014 at 958 pm Why would Moore do this. Unless shes well you know...not just the love interest. Reply TommyFlorida says February 26 2014 at 128 pm Funny review and probably whats called for in keeping with the spirit of this movie NON-STOP. Im really not a plane movie guy but it really doesnt matter where Liam Neeson is We just delight in watching his ""particular set of skills"" in action. Lets hope he makes 5 more TAKENS; age is just a thing. Reply MH Ganz says February 26 2014 at 1243 pm Please remember it is February when these non Oscar movies are scheduled for release. I look forward to seeing Michelle Dockery Lady Mary of downton Abbey fame. Reply Carlo Irwin says February 26 2014 at 1157 am Oh God; another sour grapes reviewer who is more intent on seeing how clever he can be than he is with actually reviewing. And he lists talent that I have never heard of. He probably has never even been on a set to see what takes place. If it isnt a classical story or a story about a dysfunctional family they pan it. First of all who cares what he thinks; he is probably a failed writer who loves to take jabs at writers who have been been successful. I have not yet seen a bad film that had Liam Neeson in it so I will probably see this one if only to spite this moron. Reply Gayle Falkenthal APR (PRProSanDiego) says February 26 2014 at 1056 am I wouldnt characterize an actor of Neesons stature as ""close to retirement age"" at the relatively young age of 61. Actors can log another 20 years on their careers in their 60s and 70s.

He is tired he is frustrated and -- heres the dangerous thing -- he is armed. Hes also an on-duty air marshal. And right now on this flight to London he is the only person standing between 150 passengers and the anonymous terrorist whos also on board. So yes Marks is a mess. But right now hes all theyve got. Marks is the hero of ""Non-Stop"" and by now the sort of character Liam Neeson has played way too often -- grim hard men with private griefs (and jobs that allow them to bust a few heads which generally seems to make them feel better). In fact the action thrillers Neesons been doing lately - ""Taken"" ""Taken 2"" ""Unknown"" -- have started to blur together making it hard to tell them apart. Sometimes you wonder if he can tell them apart or even tries to. Show up throw some pulled punches pick up a check. ""Schindlers List"" theyre not. ""Non-Stop"" though directed by Jaume Collet-Sera -- who did ""Unknown"" too -- at least has the advantage of a good costar in Julianne Moore and a cramped contained setting. And it flies along just fine for awhile until it really starts to lose pressure in its third act. At first we get a quick feeling for who Marks is or used to be. And the situation -- with the terrorist texting promises to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless he gets 150 million -- is a taut one. Its a good old-fashioned puzzle too with lots of suspects. Is the fiend that bullet-headed guy over there? The shifty looking character in back? Or even Moores Jen who grabbed the seat next to Marks and has managed to be both chatty and strangely secretive? Your guess is as good as anyones. These quiet moments are the best ones with Neeson and Moore doing their jobs like the old pros they are. But when theres action Collet-Sera gets overexcited and cuts things hyperbolically -- a fight in an airplane bathroom becomes not thrillingly claustrophobic but just a lot of elbows and fists. And then comes the third act. Thats often the problem in movies like this because thats when the villain or villains have to step forward and explain why theyre doing it (and how they did it). If it there are any holes the air starts to go out of everything pretty quickly. And this is when ""Non-Stop"" begins to lose pressure. True at least the film isnt as nastily xenophobic as the ""Taken"" pictures (or as loony as the two gods-and-demigods pictures Neeson did or the awful ""The A-Team."") But its both ridiculous and a little rote; Neeson has worn this genre into a rut and he still has a few more action pics lined up one of them with the same director. Thankfully hes also said to have signed to do a movie with Martin Scorsese about Catholic missionaries in feudal Japan; that return to more serious work couldnt come soon enough. Or pretty soon those grimly closed-off guys just going through the motions? They wont just be people he plays in the movies. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language and substance abuse. Non-Stop (PG-13) Universal (106 min.) Directed by Jaume Collet-Sera. With Liam Neeson Julianne Moore.

In the opening seconds of Jaume Collet-Serras Non-Stop Liam Neesons federal air marshal Bill Marks slumps in his parked vehicle sloshing a few glugs of whiskey into a paper cup and stirring it up with a toothbrush handle. Then he readies himself for work by taking a hit of Binaca and pauses for a moment fingering a snapshot of an adorable tot. In movie shorthand everything he stands to lose or has already lost is there in that photograph and Neeson plays to it as if it were a big-name costar. Somehow this fine and serious actor who has reinvigorated his career in middle age by becoming an action hero can get away with this sort of thing. He has the face noble and sad of a wounded lion; his eyes plead ""Wont you remove this thorn from my paw?"" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - If only Non-Stop were worthy of him. Neeson does just about everything right in this terror-in-the-skies thriller as does costar Julianne Moore in the somewhat thankless role of seatmate and possible love interest. Almost everybody whos anybody right now shows up in a small role Theres Scoot McNairy as a mild-mannered traveling schoolteacher Downton Abbeys Michelle Dockery as a cool-as-a-cuke flight attendant and Lupita Nyongo sporting a killer Grace Jones flat-top -- Nyongo also plays a flight attendant and unfortunately her lines are limited to things like ""This is my first time on this route"" and ""I cant believe this is happening.""But the dialogue isnt really the problem. Neesons preternaturally dejected Marks has barely schlepped onto a New York-to-London flight when his trouble starts; the movies problems take a little longer to reveal themselves. Just after takeoff he receives a mysterious text telling him that if a kajillion billion dollars (or thereabouts) isnt wired into a special account within 20 minutes someone on the plane will die. Whats more this mystery texter seems to know very personal details about Marks including his penchant for drinking on the job. Marks takes action immediately but neither he nor we can be sure its the right action. Guided by his addled sense of duty he does some smart things -- like enlisting new acquaintance Jen Summers (Moore) to help him scan video surveillance screens to see which passengers in the cabin might be using their fingers and thumbs to send the offending messages -- and some very dumb things things that if this were a real-life flight would incite instant panic among the passengers.Film Details Non-Stop RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time110 More Info Trailer Yet weirdly the passengers on this possibly doomed flight barely blink as Marks who by this point has blown his cover as a marshal violates their civil liberties left and right. Eventually though -- and be forewarned that some minor spoilers follow -- they learn from watching a live New York 1 report on their little video screens that Marks may be trying to hijack the plane himself. Only then do they decide to mutiny.Lets forget for a moment that the passengers on this particular transatlantic flight have the means to watch live news coverage revealing details of an event thats unfolding right before their eyes. Their carrier is after all a fictional outfit that may as well be called Glam Airlines where the attendants wear impossibly chic sheath dresses and totter about on spindly sky-high Manolo Blahniks. Nobodys demanding an action-thriller plot thats 100 percent plausible. But is 55 percent too much to ask?By the end of Non-Stop weve been asked to buy wholesale about 2000 things that could never ever happen in the world the filmmakers and we actually live in. But worse than that those things make little sense even in the context of movie fiction. At one point Neesons boss gets on the phone telling him to stop whatever it is hes doing or ""well shoot you down."" As were left to ponder the likelihood that the government would shoot down a plane full of innocent people just to teach one obstreperous marshal a lesson -- it could happen I guess -- other dumb stuff happens We learn that a murder by peashooter has possibly occurred. And the individual who might be responsible for all this mayhem reveals themselves unreeling a motivation that sounds like something a third-grader might make up to explain to his mother just who left that chocolate-milk stain on her couch and why.You might be thinking Who cares? Non-Stop is supposed to be fun mindless action entertainment. But an entertainment that invites us to lose ourselves in it needs to do a little thinking for us in advance. (This atrocity of a screenplay is credited to John W. Richardson Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle.) Why set up intriguing plot possibilities if you cant see them all the way through with even a modicum of logic? Non-Stop is particularly frustrating because there are so many things Collet-Serra does right including staging a hand-to-hand combat sequence in an airplane bathroom. Two guys can do a lot of damage in a tiny space -- a head crashes into a mirror; fingers gouge into soft flesh -- and the director captures it all with wit and vigor. But in the end Non-Stop is a waste of a perfectly good Neeson and of our time and goodwill. Please make it stop.
