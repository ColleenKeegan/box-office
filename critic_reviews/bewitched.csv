The twist is the producers unwittingly hire an actual witch to take the role of the nose-wiggling Samantha the part originally played by Elizabeth Montgomery.Isabel (Nicole Kidman) the witch in question has never acted in her life which is just fine with her leading man Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) a vain down-on-his-luck movie star who hopes to resurrect his flagging career with the show and wants all the close-ups. Isabel on the other hand is tired of getting anything or anybody she wants with a snap of the fingers. She wants to be needed for herself without using magic and shes naive enough to believe Jacks interest in her is genuine.This pop-Pirandellian concept written by Ephron with her sister Delia yields some healthy laughs. The comedy works best on the set of the new show where Isabel nails the audition with her inspired ""in character"" improvisations. Once Isabel discovers Jack is using her only to make himself look good she begins to slip reverting to her old spell-casting ways. Suddenly Jacks acting takes a decidedly bizarre turn. Adding to the fun is Shirley MacLaine as Iris an attention-hogging actress cast as Samanthas witchy mom Endora who captures the lecherous attentions of Isabels warlock dad (Michael Caine). Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week As long as it stays focused on showbiz ""Bewitched"" is light frothy fun. But Ephron (""Sleepless in Seattle"" ""Youve Got Mail"") insists on turning ""Bewitched"" into a love story and thats when the fun starts to seep out of the movie. Thats also when it stops making sense even on its own nonsensical terms. No matter how many times Isabels passion for Jack is explained to us it remains entirely theoretical. Having them burst into song and dance to Frank Sinatra tunes may satisfy Ephrons yearning to make a 50s-style romantic comedy but it doesnt help matters. By the tepid ending the movie appears to have been sedated.Still Kidman and Ferrell are a kick to watch. Wisely she doesnt try to ape Montgomery. Unwisely she seems at first to be channeling Marilyn Monroe overdoing the breathy little-girl voice. But once Isabel gets the part Kidman settles into a bright comic groove. Ferrell--bewitched bothered and bewildered--loosens her up. His character part monster and part pussycat barely makes sense but Ferrells inspired clowning more than compensates. He makes Jacks out-of-control egotism seem sweetly hapless. The spell ""Bewitched"" casts may evaporate before its over (witchcraft isnt what it used to be) but the laughs it does supply are nothing to sneeze at.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Starring Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. Directed by Nora Ephron. (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Bewitched"" is not the usual reworking of an old sitcom. Its a shrewd reimagining of the shows original premise updated and retooled for a world that already knows all about Samantha and Darrin. If anything its even more lightweight than the TV series though that may be hard to imagine. But its funny easily the funniest and least self-conscious movie that director Nora Ephron has made. Comedy doesnt come by accident. The sheer skill involved in making ""Bewitched"" is worth standing back to appreciate not in the way we might appreciate a Michelangelo sculpture but in the way we might an exceptionally functional and sturdy dining room table. Its just pleasant to sit at. Screenwriters Ephron and her sister Delia are able to get laughs and make character points even in the moments of laying out a fairly involved exposition and thats no small thing. Thats skilled craftsmanship. One adjustment must be made from the beginning of ""Bewitched"" There is no Samantha. But then there couldnt be because theres no Elizabeth Montgomery. Instead Nicole Kidman plays Isabel a witch who longs to experience life as non-magical human beings experience it. Unlike Samantha she has led a sheltered existence and doesnt know the ways of mortals. Isabel is a complete innocent. Thats a shrewd innovation in that it makes use of Kidmans comic gifts and doubles the number of funny characters in the movie. Theres no Darrin either. Will Ferrell plays Jack Wyatt whos a bigger idiot than Darrin and not as nice a guy. A self-centered has-been whose film career is in decline Jack agrees to star in a TV remake of ""Bewitched"" but only if an unknown is cast as his co-star. He discovers Isabel and insists that the network hire her figuring he can walk all over her. But one cant walk all over a witch for too long. The Ephrons have no interest in what might be called the more serious themes of the ""Bewitched"" sitcom. Samanthas sacrifice of immortality for love has no analogue in the movie. Nor is there any equivalent of Samanthas considered decision to give up magic for a life of suburban domesticity. On two occasions the movie indulges in something that would have been considered cheap by the standards of the TV show It has Isabel turning back time. Perhaps they did it on the sitcom too -- Im no expert -- but its a dangerous element to introduce because it means nothing is unsolvable and therefore nothing matters. Instead the Ephrons take a narrow and not particularly ambitious approach to the material turning ""Bewitched"" into an occasion for showbiz satire. But they make the most of their choices and they give the movie velocity and a sense of fun. Jack feeling insecure overcompensates with demanding antics on the set ""Make me 20 cappuccinos and bring me the best one "" Scenes of Jack playing Darrin give Ferrell a chance to get laughs by doing bad comic acting. Hes very funny. Meanwhile Isabel having her first encounter with people becomes disillusioned by humanity. She doesnt realize that shes seeing examples of humanity that would disillusion anybody. TV actors. Kidmans talent as a dramatic actress is beyond question but its only in her comedies that we see her mad streak. Here playing an innocent set loose in the human world Kidman creates a well-meaning character who never stops watching and guessing. The spectacle of Isabels half-formed thoughts and false conclusions as they register on Kidmans face is often priceless and so are the moments when Isabel abandons herself to some notion of normal human behavior which turns out to be ridiculously off. Theres something pure specific and full about Kidmans comic acting. In one scene Isabel puts a love spell on Jack goes on a date with him and becomes charmed by his attentions even though she knows its only a spell. Without Kidmans ability to convey innocence and without the clarity of her moment-to-moment being on screen that scene wouldnt have been funny. It might have been pointless and confusing. Ephron spreads out the laughs giving good moments and personalities to the secondary characters not just to Michael Caine as Isabels dad and Shirley MacLaine as the actress who plays Endora but to Heather Burns as an acerbic TV staff person with an outsized disdain for Jack. The film does sag a bit near the finish particularly when the character of Uncle Arthur (Steve Carell) formerly played by Paul Lynde makes an extended appearance. But thats the only point in ""Bewitched"" that feels unassured and the movie recovers. -- Advisory There are some drug and sex references.

"Magics Not in the Air washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Magics Not in the Air Bothered and bewildered It would take magic to make Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell believable as a nice witch and the actor who entrances her. (By John Bramley -- Columbia Pictures Via Reuters) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 24 2005 Something was bothering me while I watched ""Bewitched"" the other night something I couldnt quite put my finger on until a scene transpired in which Nicole Kidman -- who plays an actress starring as Samantha Stevens in a new televised version of the classic 1960s sitcom -- dances outside at night with Will Ferrell who plays the actor playing Darrin. As Kidmans silhouetted form kicked and twirled against the moonlight I was brought back for a nanosecond to Kidmans breakout performance in the 1995 black comedy ""To Die For"" when she performed an incredibly sexy courageous seduction dance in front of Joaquin Phoenixs headlights. And thats when I thought ""What the hell happened?"" Shocking as it is to say Kidman -- who is usually a big part of whats right in her movies -- is a big part of whats wrong with ""Bewitched"" which is a misfire in pretty much every other department too. Here shes asked to play a sweet young witch named Isabel who yearns to break out of the cushy life of casting spells for everything she wants and settles into a French provincial cottage in the San Fernando Valley. Shes discovered in a bookstore by Ferrells Jack Wyatt -- a has-been movie star looking to make his comeback in a network ""Bewitched"" remake -- and immediately he sees her as the perfect Samantha. Isabel has the nose-twitch down -- though shes no Elizabeth Montgomery -- and shes pliant naive and ego-free the perfect foil for his spotlight-stealing modus operandi. Throughout ""Bewitched"" which was directed by Nora Ephron (""Sleepless in Seattle"" ""Youve Got Mail"") Kidman delivers her lines in a breathy Marilyn Monroe whisper wearing pastel colors and lamb-soft curls to accentuate Isabels innocence. But theres something perverse about Kidman -- whose chops and ambition as an actor have been more than proven over a 20-year career -- playing the Meg Ryan role in the kind of movie even Meg Ryan doesnt make anymore. Regardless of the cute little hats and clam-diggers she wears its impossible to believe Kidman as a breathless ingenue; that relentless drive and steely Kidmanesque determination keep jutting through the cotton in flinty sharp-edged shards. Is there anything to like about ""Bewitched""? Not much except for Michael Caine who once again serves as welcome comic relief much as he did in ""Batman Begins"" yet another movie based on one of the baby boomers most treasured pop-culture shibboleths. (And Hollywood wonders why nobodys coming to its warmed-over endlessly repurposed movies this summer?) Caine plays Isabels rakish warlock father who keeps turning up at the most inopportune times and thanks to the wonders of digitized effects in the funniest places (as the Jolly Green Giant on a can of vegetables say or as Paul Newmans face on a package of microwave popcorn). But his is the only performance that doesnt seem like an imitation of somebody elses whether its Steve Carells unfortunate impression of Paul Lynde (Carell is one of several ""Daily Show"" alumni who show up in supporting roles) or Ferrell in a role that bears the unmistakable whiff of having been first offered to Jim Carrey then Greg Kinnear. As the fatuously narcissistic Wyatt Ferrell provides none of the warmth or likability that would justify him as Isabels love interest which marks another big problem with the movie Not only do we not buy Kidman as a little girl lost we cant think of one reason why she would carry a torch for this jerk. By framing ""Bewitched"" not as a remake itself but as a movie about a remake Ephron and her sister and co-writer Delia along with co-writer Adam McKay have made a creditable effort to sidestep invidious comparisons with the original show. With its TV-show-within-a-movie conceit ""Bewitched"" manages to address its adult audiences skepticism and sentimental attachments head-on such as when Wyatt and his colleagues fondly remember their favorite old episodes and characters. Ephron even goes so far as to show clips of the first show. But rather than give her version credibility they serve only as a reminder of how knowing the original ""Bewitched"" was as a comedy of corporate and domestic manners. Ironically after Kidman and Ferrell have hit all the expected marks (meet cute encounter obstacles fall in love encounter fatal setback fall back in love) the movie winds up being hoist on its own petard becoming the butt of one of its own inside jokes. Throughout ""Bewitched"" much fun is had at the expense of failed movie actors who must suffer the ignominy of doing series television. But watching Kidman mug and pout her way through such a fluffily inappropriate role you wonder If those guys are so pathetic what does that make movie stars who do pallid Hollywood remakes of TV shows? Bewitched (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some profanity including sex and drug references and partial nudity.

After all in this buoyant celebration of pop-culture sentimentality Hollywood mores and love Frank Sinatra croons ""Witchcraft"" the Eagles sing ""Witchy Woman"" and Ella Fitzgerald swings with ""Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead"" Thankfully shes not. Bewitched Thats easy. This summer film imagines a sorceress who yearns for a mortal life of home husband and hearth but instead lands a role in a television series about a witch and her mortal hubby. As Isabel Bigelow Nicole Kidman is enchanting. Seldom has the gifted beauty been quite so meringue-light. Poof. The weight of the worlds - Virginia Woolfs and Charles Fraziers - has been taken from her slender shoulders. Once Kidman floats down onto the front lawn of a lovely Los Angeles bungalow she often floats above the action. Michael Caine illuminates the background in yet another summer flick as Isabels father Nigel. (He can be seen as Alfred Bruce Waynes butler in ""Batman Begins.""). Its not so much that Nigel disapproves of his daughters desire to live among mortals - the warlock just understands how powerful the lure of magical mischief is. Bothered Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) is fast becoming a Hollywood trivia question. A star with to borrow a film critics tart assessment a range from A to B hes desperate for a comeback. Still he has the perfect accessory to stay in the game an amoral agent Richie played with a nub of dorsal fin by Jason Schwartzman. Hoping to reignite his career Jack demands that the new ""Bewitched"" swirl around Darrin. So he goes looking for a compliant TV wife. He finds Isabel the non-actress with the perfect nose. Only one magnificent problem Focus groups adore her. As for him? Well hes Darrin for crying out loud. To witness Jack lament the miscalculation of trying to lift his star with this underwhelming role is to see Ferrell at his overgrown-baby funniest. Ferrell is an inspired choice as Jack/Darrin. The popular comic actor has to hit the right note of vulnerability even as he displays moments of spoiled- star entitlement. The fake Jack prodded by his agent is insufferable. And the shows producers (David Alan Grier and Stephen Colbert) blow this blowhard a few too many kisses. The real Jack still has a liege-serf relationship to his assistant but hes all puppy otherwise. And Bewildered In the first two-thirds of ""Bewitched"" Ephron casts a spell full of romantic-comedy charm even as it goes about the post-modern business of toying with our fondness for pop-cultural baubles like ""Bewitched."" Consider the sparkling mood Ephron maintains as irreverent reverence. Recasting ""Bewitched"" as a movie about a television series based on a beloved sitcom is a trick worthy of Samantha Stephens mom Endora. (Shirley MacLaine does the honors here as Iris Smythson the hammy actress who steps into the crazy chiffon gowns of the immortal Agnes Moorehead). But it seems witchcraft defies logic. By the time Uncle Arthur (Steve Carell playing the role made indelible by Paul Lynde) shows up to assist Jack the realms of the magical and the mortal have bled into each other in ways that appear to defy logic. Its a confusion thats funny enough. Yet it feels a little like the incantation for a perfect script went slightly awry. Of course fans of the Elizabeth Montgomery series recall that Aunt Claras spells were always a little off. Yes mildly off but endearing just the same.

Players of the titular game win cash by accepting increasingly reckless dares delivered via smartphone in front of a digital audience. Movie review In ""Bad Moms"" fast food booze spike the stress of motherhood July 29 2016 ""Bad Moms"" doesnt kick into gear until three mothers fed up with the stress of helicopter parenting and the unrealistic expectations of a draconian PTA president walk into a bar. One shot leads to another and pretty soon theyre discussing their most seductive fantasies. Movie review Silly gives way to outlandish in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" July 29 2016 Ricky Baker is an orphaned juvenile delinquent a ""real bad egg"" as an onscreen title announces in ""Hunt for the Wilderpeople"" Taika Waititis endearingly playful adventure tale set in the New Zealand bush. In Jason Bourne a familiar if darker tale in a post-Edward Snowden world July 29 2016 Aside from updating to todays surveillance state ""Jason Bourne"" largely sticks to the franchises familiar moves and they often dont have the same kinetic finesse they used to.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Nicole Kidman Will Ferrell Movies or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- The new word in Hollywood for remaking an old movie or television show is ""reimagining."" That sounds so much better than ""recycling"" -- or ""cinematic grave-robbing.""Unfortunately a really good remake -- excuse me reimagining -- is as rare as a Hollywood agent who does charity work on weekends.The big-screen version of ""Bewitched"" is one of those exceptions. It works.And the main reason it works is the way that director Nora Ephron and her co-writer sister Delia approached the story. Instead of simply doing an updated version of the original TV series theyve set the movie in the present day where a studio has decided to do a remake -- yes damn it a remake -- of ""Bewitched"" the long-running (1964-72) ABC sitcom starring Elizabeth Montgomery.But the twist is the show has been retooled to center on Samanthas mortal husband Darrin played by a narcissistic washed-out movie star trying to make a comeback. Moreover unbeknownst to the producers theyve cast a real witch to play the role of Samantha. The result is not only an homage to the original TV show its also a gentle -- and at times hilarious -- spoof of Hollywood.Nicole Kidman is well cast as Isabel a young witch desperate to lead a normal life without witchcraft. When Kidman won an Academy Award for playing Virginia Woolf in ""The Hours"" much ado was made over her prosthetic nose. This time its her real nose getting the attention due to its uncanny resemblance to Montgomerys -- right down to the ability to make it twitch on cue.In an unlikely bit of casting Will Ferrell plays opposite Kidman as Jack Wyatt the over- confident and under-talented actor portraying Darrin. Determined to take center stage in the TV show Jack goes in search of a nobody to play Samantha. He finds her in a book store on Sunset Boulevard. Attracted to the aforementioned nose he convinces Isabel to audition for the role.Shes an inept mess until shes told to improvise playing a real witch trying to pass as a mortal. Naturally she nails it. She also begins to fall in love with Jack mistakenly thinking his overblown ego makes him the quintessential mortal with whom she can lead a normal life.So Isabel tells Jack shes a real witch. And the trouble starts.Light comedy Shirley MacLaine adds some welcome touches as Endora. Ephron wisely resists the temptation to burden the film with too many special effects making the few CGI touches much more effective -- particularly a great bit with Isabel in a supermarket.Kidman is usually drawn to material on the dark side but her comedic skills are on full display in ""Bewitched."" Shes without doubt one of the most versatile and accomplished actresses of her generation.Unlike millions Im not a big fan of Farrell but he delivers a well-contained performance as a total jerk who -- in the end -- turns out to be just an insecure guy with (of course) a heart of gold.The film already lighter than meringue is not without its flaws. Both Michael Caine (as Isabels rakish warlock father Nigel) and Shirley MacLaine (as an aging diva selected to play ""Bewitched"" mother Endora) are criminally underused. The two do take the opportunity to grab any scene theyre in. Caine is charmingly dissolute and MacLaine gets the best line in the film ""Actors look normal sometimes better than normal"" she tells Isabel at one point. ""But deep down there is no deep down.""Carole Shelly does a nice turn as ditsy Aunt Clara and Steve Carell channels Paul Lynne playing Uncle Arthur. Also Jason Schwartzman is a standout as Jacks sleazy manager.The Ephron sisters have a knack for sparkling dialogue and they use it to great advantage in ""Bewitched."" Sure like cotton candy the film can be a little sticky sweet at times. Ultimately however its an enjoyable summertime confection.

His quip came after host Jon Stewart expressed mock concern for audiences who will be exposed to black magic. Ferrell was quick on the uptake kidding that ""when you get mixed up in witchcraft you get burned."" Shes a witch who wants to play a witch on TV Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell play Isabel and Jack who play Samantha and Darrin. Columbia Pictures And when talented actors and filmmakers get mixed up in convoluted remakes of witchy 60s TV shows the audience gets burned. (Related video Watch the Bewitched trailer) In the movie Ferrells egocentric character Jack Wyatt keeps explaining to people ""Its not the same Bewitched you remember. Its retooled."" And not for the better. Where the sitcom starring Elizabeth Montgomery was elegantly simple the movies concept is forced and clunky. Isabel (Nicole Kidman) is a real witch who is trying to go straight and live a normal life. Meanwhile Wyatt is desperately trying to restart his floundering acting career. He is set on playing Darrin in a remake of the sitcom and begins to audition Samanthas. Isabel is hired mainly because of her expert nose-wiggling skills. So Isabel is a witch and shes playing one on TV. (Were meant to wonder if this is also true for Shirley MacLaine who plays Endora.) About the movie Bewitched   (out of four) Stars Will Ferrell Nicole Kidman Michael Caine Shirley MacLaine Jason Schwartzman Kristin Chenoweth Steve Carell Director Nora Ephron Distributor Columbia Pictures Running time 1 hour 38 minutes Rated PG-13 for some language including sex and drug references partial nudity Opens Friday nationwide Isabel who has slogged through bad relationships with warlocks and wizards is interested in Jack and the romantic mortal potential he offers. But Jack isnt looking for love or even someone to share his stardom. Once Isabel figures it out she is faced with doing what she swore she wouldnt using her powers. Kidman is a capable serious actress who takes professional risks. With the exception of last years Stepford Wives she lately has made some interesting choices (Birth and Dogville). She excelled in the darkly humorous To Die For a decade ago playing a maniacally ambitious TV personality. In this film shes the polar opposite sweet ditzy and boring. And the screenplay written by Nora and Delia Ephron isnt very funny either. Ferrell is a seriously talented comedian. So why does he choose to get mixed up in such bad high-concept movies? Last month it was Kicking amp; Screaming. One longs for his smaller scene-stealing parts in movies such as Zoolander. Bewitched does have a few laughs thanks to Ferrells antics. And some of the wittiest contemporary comedians are on board notably The Offices Steve Carell and The Daily Shows Stephen Colbert but they are underused. Bewitched will not cast you under its spell. It is more likely to bother and bewilder.

"Bewitched Is Cursed washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Bewitched Is Cursed Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman cant break the hex on the disappointing comedy ""Bewitched."" (By John Bramley) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 24 2005 THERE ARE some things that work in ""Bewitched."" Nicole Kidmans disarming smile for example. She can brighten up like the high beams on a 18-wheeler. And when she does Kidman briefly becomes what her character is meant to be a sweet-natured but very real witch who finds herself playing a fake one in a television redo of the classic TV series ""Bewitched."" Unfortunately Kidmans power smile is just one of very few flickers in a dismal movie like those isolated light bulbs that blink in an otherwise dead string of Christmas tree lights -- you know that 250-foot garland you just spent hours draping around the porch and your front yard. The other flickers come from Kidmans co-star Will Ferrell who turns on the physical comedy as much as he can. He widens the eyes makes whiny inflections in his voice or does geeky-twisty things with his body. Hes working it baby. But the trouble is it looks and feels like work. When a comedy feels that forced its as good as over. Kidman plays California resident Isabel Bigelow born into a family of warlocks and witches who has little experience with the normal worlds quirks and ironies. Determined to join that real world and find a nonmagical Mr. Right she renounces her witchery. Her father Nigel (Michael Caine apparently moonlighting from his butler duties as Alfred in ""Batman Begins"") is not happy with this. So he keeps a wary eye on his daughter. Meanwhile over-the-hill actor Jack Wyatt (Ferrell) has agreed to star in a remake of the 1960s ""Bewitched"" series but only on the condition that his witchy co-star be a nobody. He cant afford to have someone steal the show from under him. When he sees Isabel twinkle her nose just like original ""Bewitched"" star Elizabeth Montgomery he knows he has found his perfect candidate. He begs Isabel to take the part. She agrees mainly because she thinks Jack might be her candidate. This is when the fun is supposed to start. Unfortunately the plot -- which director Nora Ephron wrote with her sister Delia Ephron -- feels contrived as though the characters are only doing things because the script forced them. As for Shirley MacLaine an eccentric actress -- who takes the role of Isabels mother Endora on the TV show -- she hardly seems to belong here at all. Even the lightest of comedy should have some sort of serious underpinning. This movie has virtually none. For instance being a witch essentially means being in control of your environment. What are the ramifications of suddenly living without this supernatural ability? What is a ""normal"" life? Isnt love at its best a sort of magical liberation? These and other questions are vaguely hinted at but not so fully explored. In the end we are reduced to sitting out the movie waiting for things to end. And since we know only too well how things will turn out thats a tedious chore indeed. In the old days they used to dunk witches underwater to see if they were really weavers of evil. But thats not necessary with ""Bewitched."" It sinks so deep and fast you dont even see bubbles on the surface.

"Bewitched | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bewitched ) Bewitched (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Warning vicious personal-sounding attacks to follow. I want revenge on those who stole 100 minutes of my life. The motion picture version of Bewitched is a travesty of monumental proportions that belongs in the ""What the hell were they thinking?"" category. While I cant claim to remember every TV-to-movie translation in the last 10 years this has to be among the worst if not the worst to undergo the process. With the possible exception of a slumming Michael Caine theres not a worthwhile thing in this motion picture. I lay the lions share of the blame at the feet of co-writer/director Nora Ephron who doesnt have a clue how to make a movie unless it stars Tom Hanks. This movie is enough to convert even the most die-hard Bewitched lover into a fan of I Dream of Jeannie. When I first heard about the approach being used to adapt Bewitched I was intrigued. Finally - a movie that wasnt just going to regurgitate the storyline of a popular TV show. Instead Ephron proposed to use this as a jumping-off point. Her Bewitched would be about the behind-the-scenes goings-on of a current-day television remake of the show with the actress playing Samantha being a real-life witch. Life imitating art? As a high concept pitch it sounds good. The execution however is inexcusably sloppy. This is entertainment at its worst a stillborn 100 minutes where Will Ferrells pixilated genitals get a bigger laugh than any of the dialogue. The potential of the premise is utterly wasted. A straight remake would almost certainly have been more enjoyable. Its hard to imagine it being worse. Nicole Kidman plays Isabel Bigelow a naA-ve witch who wants to try living in the real world without her magical powers. She wants to experience ""being thwarted."" Her sage father Nigel (Michael Caine) warns her that it wont be easy. But Isabel is determined although she cheats a lot. Through a series of improbable coincidences she ends up starring opposite Jack Wyatt (Will Ferrell) on a remake of the classic TV series Bewitched. Shes Samantha to his Darren only this time around the program focuses on him not her. They fall in love he gets her mad she puts a hex on him Shirley MacLaine shows up with an eerily accurate recreation of Agnes Mooreheads Endora and Steve Carell (the weatherman in Anchorman) insults Paul Lynde with an impersonation that would make Rich Little cringe. Nicole Kidman is miscast as the romantically curious Isabel. She doesnt play the character convincingly and never channels Elizabeth Montgomery even though thats what shes trying to do. She gets the nose twitch right - probably because the script smells so bad that its a natural reaction. Likewise Will Farrell is out of his element. In the right role Farrell can be hilarious. In the wrong role - like Jack Wyatt - hes unfunny and comes across as desperate. The film also features an appearance by an actress named Kristin Chenoweth who has the distinction of being the most annoying supporting character in any 2005 movie to-date. Hearing fingernails on a blackboard would have been more appealing that being exposed to her half-dozen scenes. Bewitched begs for a cameo from an original series actor; unfortunately all of the regulars (Montgomery Moorehead David White and the two Dicks) are dead. At least Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman are still around to do their duty in next years big screen treatment of Bewitcheds rival. If I take the time to analyze whats wrong with Bewitched its easy to pick out the problem. Ephron cant decide whether she wants it to be. A satire that mocks Hollywood and pokes fun at the cheesy aspects of the original? An homage that pays tribute to a show almost everyone in America has seen? Or When Darren Met Samantha? Ephron doesnt know and this causes a narrative tug-of-war resulting in a tone thats as uneven as a roller coaster. Plus its just not funny. Despite every possible reminder of Bewitched (including clips from the TV program photographs of Samantha and different renditions of the theme song - even one sung by Frank Sinatra) the movie fails to connect with the show on any level - emotional intellectual or nostalgic. Its a disgrace from start to finish. There are only two remotely clever moments. The first of these is the ""new"" TV series credits. The second occurs at the end - far too little and too late to prevent this rancid cinematic morsel from causing major indigestion. In a way its a good thing all the cast members are dead. That way they have been spared the sad sight of what Hollywood of the 00s did to their show.

Burdened by its show-within-a-movie-about-a-show structure ""Bewitched"" suffers from its sheer peculiarity as well as a lack of chemistry (or alchemy for that matter) between leads Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. Nora Ephrons attempt to reconceive the standard TV-to-bigscreen adaptation goes bizarrely haywire here spinning out of control like a runaway broomstick. Burdened by its show-within-a-movie-about-a-show structure ""Bewitched"" suffers from its sheer peculiarity as well as a lack of chemistry (or alchemy for that matter) between leads Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. Despite the occasional grudging moment of strange magic thanks to Ferrells antics and the large talented but wholly squandered supporting cast whatever initial box office curiosity exists should give way to DVD banishment once word-of-mouth casts its spell. Although the idea of finding a fresh way to tackle such material is admirable what finally emerges is a film that has about three different movies in it -- ""Splash""-type fish out of water? Hollywood romance? Down-on-his-luck actor gets magical career help? -- and thats unable to settle on any of them. Isabel (Kidman) is a real-life witch who yearns to be a normal person though she hasnt quite mastered not employing magic to tidy up. Setting up house in Hollywood her womanizing warlock dad (Michael Caine always welcome though put to much better use in ""Batman Begins"") warns that shell miss her powers. Soon however Isabel stumbles into Jack (Ferrell) a neurotic movie star coming off a major flop and in the midst of a nasty marital breakup -- problems that are forcing him to consider slumming in television. (""Bewitched"" wont have the same effect on Ferrell but its hard to resist pointing out that two or three more misfires of this scale might.) Jacks squirrelly agent (Jason Schwartzman) brings him a sitcom remake of ""Bewitched"" but to avoid the Darrin syndrome -- that is being so much the second banana that they could change actors practically without notice -- he insists on selecting an unknown as Samantha. Enter Isabel who can do that nose-crinkling thing Elizabeth Montgomery made famous and in her new-to-town naivete takes the job mostly because she has a crush on Jack. Actually being a witch it turns out means not having to think much when youre asked to improvise. Alas though the producers decision to highlight Jack means that he freely steps all over Isabels lines which she eventually discovers throwing a monkey wrench in their budding off-set romance. And despite all that she still ends up testing higher with focus groups. As written by director Ephron and her sister Delia pic exhibits a fondness for the original series but doesnt click as a romance -- in part because the miscast Ferrells character is such a self-absorbed boor its hard to fathom what Isabel sees in him. Even the narrative timeline gets confusing as the series is said to be taping a second episode after it seems (or at least feels) like its been on the air for months. In terms of Kidman her latest nose-centric role wont make anyone forget ""The Hours."" Playing Isabel as a wide-eyed waif in fact makes her mostly uninteresting with more of a spark coming from Kristin Chenoweth (a more beguiling witch herself in ""Wicked"") as her feisty neighbor. Then again there are lots of potentially funny people with not much to do including ""The Daily Shows"" Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell and Shirley MacLaine as the hammy actress playing Samanthas mom. Yet whatever charm Ephron brought to ""Sleepless in Seattle"" the magics gone here lost amid a pace that not-so-magically causes time to slow down in the second act. ""Bewitched"" does attempt to make use of trappings from the series including its jaunty theme crooned by Steve Lawrence. Theres even one particularly intriguing act of magic as Isabel causes time to rewind so she can erase the unforeseen consequences of a wayward spell. Watching the movie run backward though only spurs reflection on whether it should have kept unspooling in reverse a little further -- all the way back to the development stage.
