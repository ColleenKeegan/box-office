Comments Wedding Crashers Recommended Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are enormously funny in this farce about two divorce mediators in the D.C. area who spend their leisure time crashing big weddings so they can seduce unescorted women. The early scenes deliver some rich send-ups of wedding culture (killing time during the ceremony they bet on which tired Bible reading theyre about to hear) but the fun really begins when Vaughn and Wilson hook up with two pretty sisters whose dad (Christopher Walken) is secretary of the treasury. Before long the hustlers are vacationing with the secretarys dysfunctional family including his wife (Jane Seymour) who wants Wilson to touch her breasts and his gay son (Keir ODonnell) who wants Vaughn to touch him anywhere. David Dobkin directed; with Rachel McAdams and Jennifer Alden. R 119 min. By J.R.

Sony Pictures Classic By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 20 2011 1201 a.m. ET In Woody Allens beguiling and then bedazzling new comedy nostalgia isnt at all what it used to be--its smarter sweeter fizzier and ever so much funnier. From the first note of music over a dark screen--a soprano saxophone played by some ghost of Sidney Bechet--""Midnight in Paris"" teases us into expecting nothing more or less than a charming pastiche of the bits and pieces that pop up in many Woody Allen films. The jazz score from another era introduces scenes of the city--not Manhattan in black-and-white splendor but Paris under a bright summer sun. Then a troubled writer makes his appearance--not the blocked novelist played by Josh Brolin in last years ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" but Gil a hack screenwriter played by Owen Wilson who wants to be a novelist. (He and his prickly fiancee Inez played by Rachel McAdams have joined her parents on what began as a business trip for her father.) To round out the familiar cast of archetypes theres Michael Sheens insufferable Paul a poseur who insists that Versailles means ""a place where the weeds have been pulled."" Watch a clip from ""Midnight in Paris"" starring Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams and Kathy Bates. The conflicts are also familiar and entertaining. The earnestly liberal Gil argues back and forth with his prospective father-in-law a conservative Republican who takes a dim view of him as well as his politics. Paul dismisses Gils nostalgia for a Paris that no longer exists as nothing but denial of the painful present. The name for this malady he announces is ""golden-age thinking."" All of that is well and good but this 44th film written and directed by Mr. Allen--imagine 44 films over four decades--has better poissons to saute. The plot flips at midnight when Gil a solitary wanderer lost in a maze of cobblestone streets spots a black-and-yellow apparition coming around a corner--a huge old Rolls-Royce filled with expat revelers. And not just a Rolls but a magic coach that might have come from a Cocteau fantasy. Once Gil joins the revels his tipsy befuddlement escalates to the innocent astonishment that Mr. Wilson has done so well in the past and does superlatively in Gils present which is interwoven with the fabled past of the Ville-Lumiere. Im starting to write in circles here because Im conflicted myself I dont want to spoil any surprises but I do want to convey the sense of joyous delight that flows from the films time-hops. Maybe the best way of getting into it is by noting that Gil was also the name of the movie actor played by Jeff Daniels in one of my favorite Woody Allen films--one of my favorite films period--""The Purple Rose of Cairo."" The magical moment of that achingly lyrical fantasy comes when Gils character an intrepid archaeologist steps out of the screen and into Mia Farrows grim Depression-era life. In ""Midnight in Paris"" lyricism yields though not entirely to the scintillating lunacy of a wannabe writer stepping into another era and finding himself in the midst of the writers and artists he has worshipped as gods. Cocteau is only one of many. The pianist singing songs with phenomenal lyrics--""in shallow shoals English soles do it""--isnt just a pianist. An American poet introduces himself as Tom. The alpha literary lion of the milieu is Corey Stolls Ernest (Im going along with the first-name-only game played by the credits) a somber self-mythologist who speaks about love and death in run-on sentences and keeps trying to pick fights. Mr. Fitzgeralds hair is impeccably marcelled while Mrs. Fitzgeralds psyche is so tangled that Gil gives her a Valium. (Shes played brilliantly by Alison Pill.) Kathy Bates is not just hilarious shes eerily convincing as Gertrude who of course has Pablos portrait of her hanging in her salon. (Speaking of the dour Pablo Ernest says ""Hes great but hes no Miro."") Gils presence is readily accepted by Adrien Brodys Salvador as well as by Salvadors friends Man and Luis; they see no problem with someone living in two worlds because theyre surrealists. Mr. Allen offers this inspired nonsense with the casual aplomb of an absurdist; its all so silly and such wonderful fun. That changes though when he brings on Adriana an aspiring fashion designer and sometime mistress of various painters in town Pablo among them. Shes as real as the marvelous Marion Cotillard can make her which is to say intensely and for Gil sublimely Adriana is everything his fiancee isnt with the added attraction of being a legend. And through their adventure in another magic coach ""Midnight in Paris"" reconsiders Pauls diagnosis. When was the golden age and why didnt we get to live in it? Its a serious question that the movie has the good grace to take whimsically though theres no contest photographically between present and past. The superb cinematographer Darius Khondji floods his vistas of daytime Paris with light thats gentle but banal while Anne Seibels production design turns several coins de rue into vaguely cheesy movie sets. In the nighttime Paris that Gil explores the colors are rich the shadows are deep the mists promise mystery and serpentine alleys invite the sort of dreamy meanders that suit Gil so well. (Annoyed by his romantic affection for soft summer showers Inez asks early on ""Why does every city have to be in the rain?"" One answer is that cameras love the look of wet pavements.) At the same time the movie gives todays Paris a boost by populating it with women whose intelligence and sensitivity are equal to their beauty. One of them a guide at the Rodin Museum is played by Frances First Lady Carla Bruni. (More than a piquant cameo its a pleasing performance.) Another Lea Seydouxs Gabrielle sells antiques at an outdoor stand and values Gil as a customer with special tastes. ENLARGE Johnny Depps Jack Sparrow accompanied by redcoats in Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides. Disney Actors have always been eager to work with Mr. Allen; heres another demonstration of why. Every member of the cast shines at varying intensities Ms. McAdams as a young almost-married whos lively and attractive albeit a scold; Kurt Fuller as Inezs acidulous father; Mimi Kennedy as her dryly sarcastic mother; and in lesser roles Nina Arianda Tom Hiddleston Daniel Lundh and Michel Vuillermoz. But this is Mr. Wilsons picture. Practiced though his trademark naivete may be its entirely fresh once again because hes so good at playing such a complex role. Gil is a bit of a goofball but he is also without knowing it the genuine artist he yearns to be. For the filmmaker who brought these intertwined universes into being the film represents new energy in a remarkable career. In recent years Mr. Allens output has been variable; a succession of small mostly agreeable entertainments punctuated by the disagreeable miscalculation of ""Whatever Works"" and the glorious madness of ""Vicki Cristina Barcelona."" Whats new about ""Midnight in Paris""--about its cheerful shallows along with its unstressed depths--is the lovely unseriousness of the whole venture. Just as Luis Bunuel did Woody Allen is growing more playful as he gets older. His new movie truly is a place where the weeds have been pulled. Everything comes up roses. Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides ""Its not the destination so much as the journey"" Johnny Depps Captain Jack Sparrow declares in this latest addition to the theme park ride. For me it was not so much the journey as the destination--the curtained opening beneath the Exit sign--so Im not the one to say whether this film is better or worse than the previous one. Its definitely shorter and more coherent Jack and Geoffrey Rushs Barbossa both sail off to find the Fountain of Youth but Ian McShanes Blackbeard is after it too and not just Blackbeard and his crew of zombies but his daughter Angelica who is played by Penelope Cruz with a what-am-I-doing-here expression on her face. (She looks cute with a moustache.) Watch a clip from ""Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides"" starring Johnny Depp Penelope Cruz and Geoffrey Rush. Keith Richards in another cameo as Captain Teague asks ""Does this face look like its found the Fountain of Youth?"" Nope it does not. Mr. Depp fulfills his flouncing quota though his deadpan sometimes goes completely dead. The movie was written by ""Pirates"" stalwarts Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio. Theyre funny guys and the script might well be funny too but its hard to tell from the metronome rhythms set for the actors by the director Rob Marshall and by the editors working as galley slaves under their producer Jerry Bruckheimer. I did like an elaborate swarm of mermaids especially the one who washes up on the movies shores; her name is Syrena with a ""y"" to distinguish her from common sirens and shes played by Astrid Berges-Frisbey. But the IMAX print I saw was so murky as to make you give thanks for the few scenes shot in simple sunlight the 3-D wasnt worth the bother and never before have I wanted to chloroform an entire orchestra. DVD FOCUS Wedding Crashers (2005) Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are John and Jeremy motor-mouthed con men who crash wedding receptions to pick up girls. In the opening scene set in an office where the longtime friends maintain a dubious practice as divorce mediators an aggrieved husband laces into his wife who replies furiously ""You shut your mouth when youre talking to me"" This tidbit of skewed logic is only one bright moment of many in a film blessed with language thats sharply honed if often raunchy. Rachel McAdams is a bridesmaid Claire with whom John falls hopelessly in love. La Vie en Rose (2007) Marion Cotillard won an Oscar for her astonishing performance as the tortured impassioned Edith Piaf. In the spirit of Piafs signature song I regret nothing about ""La Vie en Rose""--not the narrative confusion the sketchy details or the lack of historical context. Olivier Dahans long harrowing and phantasmagorical biopic doesnt bother with such events as World War II which slips by unnoticed. This isnt negligence but a reflection of Piafs point of view. Her life was only about singing and searching for love. And always the songs she sang with the intensity of a cyclotron beam. Broken Embraces (2009) Penelope Cruz does her best to act badly during several passages in Pedro Almodovars tragicomedy but her effort is doomed to failure. Shes magnificent even when her performance is supposed to be clumsy and those passages arent what they seem anyway. Theyre part of a wonderfully elaborate joke in a film that serves as a love letter to the movies and a demonstration of the mediums mysterious power. Ms. Cruzs Lena is part of a quadrangle that involves a blind Spanish screenwriter and former director an ominously amorous tycoon and the former directors production assistant. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Although director Dobkin maintains that crucial slacker-psycho balance by employing Vince Vaughns powdered-nose manicosity as Wilsons comic foil you cant help but feel theres a gaping hole where a small ball of crimplene-haired intensity should be. Vaughn and Wilson play two divorce mediators who get their kicks from gatecrashing weddings where they have a wild old time entertaining the kids dominating the dancefloor scoffing the cake and shagging the bridesmaids. All is sporadically amusing in their bubble of optimistic immaturity until the abruptly mood-sapping spectacle of LUV rears its ugly head forcing these less-than-boyish lotharios (were not that young goes one refrain) to reconsider their priorities during a weekend break with Christopher Walken (dont worry it all makes sense on screen).Caught partway between sensitive rom-com and boisterous buddy-flick Wedding Crashers is never sure how to resolve this divide and - abandoning any pretence at brevity - methodically works through a cornucopia of subplots comic tones and supporting characters in a bid to find a solution. Walken crops up as a De Niro-style scary father-in-law Jane Seymour briefly debases herself Isla Fisher appears as an ancillary love interest and finally Will Ferrell is called in to make sure things close with a bang. The latters ten-minute cameo almost pays off but its too little too late; the lack of comic sleekness has already proved fatal. Its good but its no Anchorman.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Wedding Crashers Catches the Bouquet washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Wedding Crashers Catches the Bouquet Lock up your bridesmaids Owen Wilson left and Vince Vaughn are the irresistible if uninvited life of the post-nuptial party. (By Richard Cartwright -- New Line Productions) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 15 2005 Some men will do anything to get a date; good lord some of them will even be nice to other peoples children. Thats pretty much the technique of Jeremy Klein (Vince Vaughn) and John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) in ""Wedding Crashers."" Jeremy and John arent so much wedding crashers as wedding vikings. Theyre raiders who swoop in eat drink carouse suck up to whoever is paying for the spread dance with old ladies make balloon hats for kiddies -- the horror the horror -- play on the sentimentalized weaknesses of those on the other side of the gender line then score and flee. The best that can be said of them is They dont pillage or burn and they appear to have acceptable hygiene. Based on that alarmingly cynical premise the film chronicles the end of the two cads as each is tamed by that which he fears the most that dog from hell called love. It doesnt help much that Vaughns Jeremy is a lot more interesting than Wilsons John and that Jeremys ultimate match Gloria (spicy spunky Isla Fisher) is a lot more interesting than Johns ultimate Claire (cute bland Rachel McAdams). It also doesnt help that the movie is half an hour too long and has bad third-act troubles. None of those things helps; but none hurts much either because ""Wedding Crashers"" is so lung-bloatingly funny. ""Wedding Crashers"" has the distinction of being the rare R-rated comedy from an industry that has of late much preferred the somehow smuttier but less amusing hard-PG-13. But ""Crashers"" is pure hard R for Raunch and aRrested development to say nothing of Ruthlessness and iRresponsibility. Its rat-brain primitive and the scene where Jeremy is um put through an excellent adventure under the dinner table in a dining room full of otherwise cold-blooded WASPy types should have everyone talking about it by Monday. The movie has a good time in the early going as the two fellows -- their cynicism is well-earned as professional divorce mediators who are used to seeing marriages come unglued in rancor greed and ugliness -- shunt through a variety of ceremonies and receptions. They become what they must become Jewish Italian even Asian; theyre so infectious in their enthusiasm they fit in anywhere. They have mastered ethnic dances and wedding customs they have a litany of jokes for each audience and the balloon trick for the kids is sheer genius as is the cant-miss-at-Republican-weddings line ""We lost a lot of good men over there but [sniffle sniffle] I dont want to talk about it."" At each reception theyre always the life of the party the first to dance the most generous attentive and sporting. Its just that theyre you know complete phonies. Theyve learned that the secret to success is the ability to fake sincerity and they fake sincerity really well. Their comeuppance is cleverly engineered. The setting being Washington D.C. (the town looks good by the way) they decide to crash as a last hurrah the summers biggest event the nuptials of one of the children of the secretary of the treasury William Cleary (Christopher Walken). One of his blond daughters -- how could he tell which one? -- is marrying a blond hunk who is named Chad Tad Nick or possibly Stone or Brick something like that. This is the big enchilada of weddings and so the boys feel duty-bound to get in. And they do too. Then a terrible thing happens Each falls for a different Cleary daughter. For John its Claire who attracts him because she Sees Through It. That is when her sister and the new hubby recite vows theyve written for themselves Claire thinks its so stupid its funny. It is stupid and funny; the only problem is Claires boyfriend a thug in a polo shirt whos not stupid and funny just stupid. Meanwhile big Jeremy picks up on Gloria who is putting out certain easy-to-get signals that most guys will recognize but pass on it being akin to shooting fish in a barrel. Not Jeremy who never met a fish in a barrel at whom he wouldnt take a shot. The real discovery of the film is Fisher who plays the presumably easy-to-woo Gloria as a ""Phase-5 clinger."" Shes not only a girl who cant say no but who wont hear no when it is said to her. She gloms limpetlike to Jeremy who wants nothing more than to escape. Neatly by that time John has fallen for Claire so the movie is sustained by an interesting conflict of motives Jeremy yearns to flee John to stay thus their partnership is sorely tested. Its also this circumstance that yields the movies most hysterical sequence a long weekend at the Cleary manse somewhere on the Chesapeake. The Clearys as any family headed by Christopher Walken would surely be turn out to be as comically twisted as anybodys a kind of compilation of old-family pathologies out of Eugene ONeill and Charles Addams. Besides the super-horny Gloria theres her mother played at a pitch of high want by Jane Seymour in a refreshingly non-goody-goody tone theres a bitter gay son the angry boyfriend a twisted granny and of course ever magnificent the strangest man on Earth Walken as head of this menagerie. In the end ""Wedding Crashers"" loses its nerve. After having said nothing good about anybody it suddenly says everything good about everybody. The ending so long in coming is like that deflating moment in the classical Don Rickles canon when after tearing the world collectively a new nether passage hed turn to Johnny and say ""But you know were really all brothers under the skin blah blah blah blah."" Ugh. When Jeremy and John quarrel break up and get mopey and then figure out how to get back together and everything turns out happily after all -- what a bummer. Wedding Crashers (119 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for sexually explicit language and humor.

Ran on 07-10-2005 Hey lets get some free cake free booze and bridesmaids 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Wedding Crashers Comedy. Starring Owen Wilson Vince Vaughn Rachel McAdams and Christopher Walken. Directed by David Dobkin. (R. 119 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The idea behind ""Wedding Crashers"" -- Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn as two friends who go to strangers nuptials and lie to score with women -- is cant-miss hilarious. This project could have gotten a studio green light based on four words scrawled on the back of a cocktail napkin Vince Owen weddings breasts. Unfortunately the inspired concept is coupled with weak screenwriting and the movie turns out to be much more fun to think about than it is to watch. Despite sincere efforts from the actors an R rating that frees up the language and a Will Ferrell cameo that takes only five minutes to double the movies laugh count the films pleasures are greatly outnumbered by its failed expectations. ""Wedding Crashers"" begins so abruptly with such a clumsy setup that it feels like a sequel. After an amusing scene where John (Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) are introduced as divorce mediators director David Dobkin jumps straight to a montage where the crashers tear up the dance floor eat too much food and seduce women to the wedding party song ""Shout."" By the end of the song John and Jeremys personalities are still indistinguishable other than Jeremys revolting tendency to stuff his face with cake. Vaughns overflowing mouth of frosting marks the beginning of the movies frustrations. Unlike the reality-disregarding universes of ""Starsky and Hutch"" starring Wilson and ""Old School"" starring Vaughn ""Wedding Crashers"" takes itself very seriously as a romantic comedy. Yet the movie never adequately explains how John and Jeremy avoid getting discovered and thrown out on the street after they cut the cake openly make out with bridesmaids and even give drunken toasts. Seventeen weddings and nobody thought to check the seating chart? The movies dramatic intentions completely fall apart when John falls for Claire (Rachel McAdams) and ends up on a ""Meet the Fockers""-style weekend with her eccentric family complete with a violent football game involving Claires too-evil-to-be-credible fiance. From this point Dobkin bathes Wilson and McAdams in the flattering light melodic string-laden musical score and cute cat-and-mouse romance games of a Jennifer Lopez movie -- including a bike ride through a meadow that isnt played for laughs. Throughout the movie Wilson and Vaughn struggle against the derivative script of newcomers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. About half the scenes sound like the dialogue was written by someone other than the characters and they are the worst parts of the movie. ""Sarah I feel like I dont even know you"" John says to a conquest he just slept with. When she responds ""My name is Vivian"" who in the audience didnt see it coming? Thats the most memorable in a checklist of recycled gags from the ""Porkys"" era including a foul- mouthed grandmother an adulterously hot mother-in-law and the logically questionable use of eye drops as a diuretic to momentarily sideline a potential suitor. During the rest of the film Vaughn and Wilson seem to be ad-libbing and these fast-talking scenes work the best. Vaughns patter is better in small doses but with Claires crazy sister as a love interest he has a lot more to work with than Wilson. Each gets a funny scene involving kids and balloon animals. And while the actors arent very convincing as louses who fall for their intended prey at least they have chemistry with each other. The movie ends strong in part because of the welcome presence of Ferrell as another crasher. He momentarily takes the humor totally off the rails where it should have been in the first place. Farrell is really funny but mostly serves to remind viewers that the five minutes of wedding footage in ""Old School"" were better than the 50 minutes in ""Wedding Crashers."" And you would never catch Frank the Tank riding his bicycle through a meadow with a love interest. At least not with his clothes on. -- Advisory Nudity profanity sex and some violence including scenes involving a psychotic bridesmaid that may be traumatic for guys who have had a lot of crazy girlfriends.

Directed by David Dobkin from a screenplay by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. Rated R for sexual content/nudity and language. 119 minutes. Several theaters. Those busy pondering the Great Box-Office Slump of 2005 (now officially the most overreported story of the year) will have lots of fun analyzing ""Wedding Crashers"" an inexcusably inept comedy that should continue to keep the multiplexes quiet. Theres no reason why this movie shouldnt have worked its got a funny premise a talented cast and an obviously lavish budget. But it lands without even a crash; just a dull unfunny thud. It takes work to make Owen Wilson not funny so at least director David Dobkin has accomplished something. Wilson looking exceptionally tanned and blond and Vince Vaughn star as John and Jeremy a pair of overgrown boys in suits. Theyre actually thirtysomething divorce mediators who share a long friendship and a hobby crashing weddings in order to meet women. And theyre very good at it having learned to blend in give charming speeches entertain kids dance with grandmas lead a crowd in singing ""Shout"" and more often than not snare a pretty bridesmaid. After a few preliminaries the film kicks off with a goofy montage of John and Jeremy having a ball at a cross-section of weddings. Its bouncy and fun and you settle in with your popcorn and your hopes. Then -- thud. Enter the well-connected Cleary family who are extremely rich and have a lot of good-looking daughters. Our boys attend a Cleary wedding schmooze the bridesmaids and find themselves heading off to the Cleary compound for the weekend a waterfront home just a tiny bit smaller than Scarlett OHaras Tara. And then well the movie just goes on for much longer than it should with annoying preppies and flirtatious mothers (poor Jane Seymour) and libidinous virgins and mismatched couples who eventually get sorted out. And unless you enjoy watching a parade of lavishly decorated bedrooms its a whole lot of nothing. The peppy Vaughn who talks like a speeded-up teletype machine and laid-back Wilson should have made a charming comic team but theyve got nothing to do other than repeatedly observe that theyre a little old for this. And Dobkin needs to learn a few things about pace; his movies slower than a wedding processional. A few sparks come from squiggly-voiced newcomer Isla Fisher who brings a gleam to the eye of bridesmaid Gloria Cleary thats both angelic and diabolical. But ultimately even Christopher Walken (as the Cleary patriarch) fades into the expensive-looking woodwork. With the potential of this cast ""Wedding Crashers"" is a major disappointment; not even bad enough to be enjoyable trash.

Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) left and John (Owen Wilson) get introduced to hunting in Wedding Crashers.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Vince Vaughn is the walking talking face-stuffing id. No thought goes unspoken. No leer goes unseen. No hors doeuvre goes untasted. And Vaughns hard work makes the hybrid comedy ""Wedding Crashers"" work. Part R-rated raunch fest part buddy movie part chick flick ""Wedding Crashers"" owes much of its success to Vaughn who keeps all the parts jumping with his abrasive mouth. When the bridesmaid walks down the aisle and the wide-eyed Vaughn says ""Dibs"" he says it all. But he also says it in long rants excruciating tirades puling complaints. At one point Vaughns Jeremy Gray is subjected to a bondage session with a woman and then an ""inappropriate"" gift from her brother. We see it all but its even funnier when Vaughn sums it up for Owen Wilson at breakfast ""A midnight rape and a nude gay art show."" Vaughns comedy hooks up reality to a higher voltage. Gray and John Beckwith (Wilson) are divorce mediators who spend each summer crashing weddings of strangers to meet women. Stop me if youve heard this one before but they exploit love for sex. Still ""Wedding Crashers"" succeeds because its sympathetic to the raw emotions that big ceremonies scrape open. Vaughn and Wilson have terrific chemistry clearly the element that set Hollywood executives rubbing their hands with glee over an R comedy for adults rather than another mush- mouthed please-no-one PG-13. When Wilson worries about a cash-bar wedding Vaughn flips open a box of fake Purple Hearts that will get them free drinks. They trade bridesmaid-killing lines ""They say we only use 10 percent of our brains. I think we only use 10 percent of our hearts."" During the ceremonies they bet on little sisters choice of Bible readings ""Twenty bucks says First Corinthians."" But Wilson playing his usual dopey-sweet role breaks the cardinal rule of bachelor crashing by falling in love. At the wedding of the secretary of the Treasurys oldest daughter he goes moony over middle daughter Rachel McAdams. Vaughn meanwhile takes dibs on youngest daughter Isla Fisher who may turn out to be randier than he is. A ""Meet the Parents"" interlude goes on a bit long - we have to be menaced and charmed by Christopher Walken as the Treasury secretary and dispatch the obnoxious boyfriend the sex-starved wife (Jane Seymour) and the potty-mouthed grandmother. Director David Dobkin who previously coached Wilson in ""Shanghai Knights"" should know that comedy is 90 minutes unless you apply for a special license. Much has been made of the R rating at a time when many studios tamp everything down to the PG-13 level for better box office. (Tougher enforcement of the R costs teenage ticket sales.) What ""Wedding Crashers"" gets right is that theres more to an R than extra F-bombs. Targeting adults means smarter material if you get the right script and writers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher have a nice ear for the funnier things that make us human. Staff writer Michael Booth can be reached at 303-820-1686 or mboothdenverpost.com.

"I Do I Do Say yes to the irresistible Wedding Crashers Slate Sign In Sign Up I Do I Do Say yes to the irresistible Wedding Crashers I Do I Do Say yes to the irresistible Wedding Crashers Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 14 2005 948 PM I Do I Do Say yes to the irresistible Wedding Crashers By David Edelstein Wilson and Vaughn score Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn seem to show up in a new movie every month and their shtick is getting old. Theyre Johnny-One-Notes. Wilson is always the diffident soft-spoken semi-stoned surfer dude made adorably vulnerable by a nose that goes in like six different directions. Vaughn is the really tall sleazy jabbering gonzo wild man. The poster for Wedding Crashers (New Line) makes it clear that the film will be more of what weve come to expect and it is. The difference is that its funny--and not funny in a scattershot way. Its funny in a way that makes the pleasures mount up. No its not Preston Sturges It has a soft center and its totally formulaic. But the script by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher is one of those high-speed ping-pong-banter marvels in which youre still laughing from the last great line when youre hit by the next. And say what you will about Wilson and Vaughn they have timing even Groucho would salute. Vaughn is like the machine that shoots tennis balls--thunk-thunk-thunk--while Wilson lulls you with his lazy rhythms and when your guard is down nails you with the joke. Advertisement As you know from the title (the movie was probably a one-sentence pitch) this is the story of two men whose seasonal hobby is crashing weddings and seducing the marriage-minded females who are already softened up by the ceremony. As mediators for divorce cases they have a suitably jaded view of long-term relationships and marriage. For them quantity equals quality. What makes their antics amusing is that when they show up at receptions where nobody knows them they dont keep a low profile. They go right out and dance with the bride and her family (especially the old grandmas). They entertain the kids under the admiring eyes of their female prey. They make toasts. The first act of the movie climaxes in a dizzying montage of women (some topless) surrendering to our heroes their happy squeals intercut with frenzied renditions of ""Shout"" from multiple weddings (with multiple religions and ethnicities). ""A little bit softer now ... a little bit louder now ..."" The sequence builds and builds and then explodes. OK the view of women is admittedly sexist. Given the moralistic climate of the moment though its exhilarating to see a genuinely R-rated comedy with dirty talk and casual sex. Wedding Crashers has incensed some conservative commentators because Sen. John McCain a one-time critic of filthy Hollywood values shows up in a cameo. But the joke might be on the finger-waggers because the values here are pretty traditional. After the pairs series of triumphs Wilsons John sits depleted on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with the Washington Monument in the distance mocking him with its stiffness. He feels empty--and guilty. Although Vaughns Jeremy reassures him in the grubbiest manner imaginable you know that these feckless studs will have to pay for their carnal crimes that theyll suffer much when true love pitches its tent in their hearts. The director David Dobkin made a half-successful black comedy in 1998 called Clay Pigeons in which Vaughn was a hoot as a serial killer whose bland bonhomie grew creepier with each new corpse. Then he got the same old lazy Wilson turn (opposite Jackie Chan) in the tiresome Shanghai Knights. The beauty part is that he obviously knows the duos strengths and limitations. He knows that Wilsons crooked features can look especially poignant in repose and that Vaughns size can breed hilarity when he tries to slink away. (Call this the John Cleese Principle.) Dobkin keeps you laughing even when the movie takes a more conventional turn. That happens when John and Jeremy crash the ""Kentucky Derby of weddings"" with the daughter of the old-WASP secretary of the treasury played by Christopher Walken. (I wouldnt trust him with my money but his chill deadpan is priceless.) John is instantly smitten by the brides dimply sister Claire (Rachel McAdams) whos too ravishing and unaffected--not to mention brainy--to seduce and abandon. So he breaks all the rules of wedding-crashing and prevails upon Jeremy to journey to the familys country house. The problem is that Jeremy has already made it with the third daughter (the sparkling mega-babe Isla Fisher soon to be Mrs. Sasha Baron Cohen) whom he refers to as ""a stage-five clinger."" Sticking around runs contrary to the existential foundation of Jeremys life. In the films second half the conflict shifts Its now between our increasingly helpless con-artist heroes and an extended family of ruthless WASP bluebloods--indefatigable sailors voracious quail hunters and bone-crunching touch-football players. Weve ventured into Meet the Parents territory only soppier John really moons over Claire who has a rich assholic WASP fiance (Bradley Cooper). But Dobkin (and his beat-perfect editor Mark Livolsi) manage to keep the pace from slackening too much. Wedding Crashers has a couple of cards up its sleeve the secretarys morbid-artist son (Keir ODonnell) and his own peculiar predilections and a comic superstar cameo. (If you know the oeuvre of Wilson and Vaughn you know it can only be one of two actors. And its not the shorter one.) Yes the movie turns sappy and conventional in the last 10 minutes. But its a mark of a good seducer that you recognize the hustle but go along anyway because resisting would be a drag. Wedding Crashers gives you a great shallow romp without making you feel bad in the morning. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

"Wedding Crashers | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; wedding-crashers ) Wedding Crashers (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Please note Obvious references to Animal House Porkys American Pie and Old School will not be used in this review. Whether appropriate or not those titles will not appear. During the first ten minutes of Wedding Crashers we are treated to a display of the debauched antics that were staples in comedies of the late 1970s and 1980s. Alas its only a tease. Pretty soon this movie settles into the comfortable groove of telling its story - a by-the-numbers romantic comedy thats far too plot-heavy for its own good. The jokes become farther between and less funny as the filmmakers mistakenly believe that we in the audience actually care about the characters and their romantic entanglements. No clichA(c) goes unmissed as the movie stumbles along its pre-determined trajectory. Im not going to explicitly reveal the ending but if you have seen more than one romantic comedy in your day youll know whats coming. One of my rules of motion pictures is that only a rare comedy can hold an audience for more than 90 minutes. Theres a reason why most humor-based motion pictures are short its easy for this kind of film to wear out its welcome. Wedding Crashers is nearly two hours long and it would have been a more jaunty jovial affair had the second half of the movie been reduced by 50%. All of the so-called ""character building"" falls flat and the morose guilt-laden feelings associated with the ""romantic complications"" drag on forever. Plus theres a disturbing scene of graphic violence that has no place being in a movie designed to make us laugh. John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy Klein (Vince Vaughn) are professional wedding crashers. They appear uninvited at weddings insinuate themselves into the crowd by pretending to be obscure relatives of the bride or groom and partake of the open bar and hopefully open legs of the bridesmaids. When the eldest daughter of Treasury Secretary William Cleary (Christopher Walken) is getting married John and Jeremy decide to pull off the mother of all wedding crashes. And it works perfectly except for two complications. John unexpectedly falls for one of the brides sisters Claire (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy becomes the object of another sisters (Isla Fisher) stalking. The Secretary likes them so much that he invites them back to a private party at his house and they end up there for the weekend. This gives John a chance to spend some time with Claire and size up the competition her burly fiancA(c) Sack (Bradley Cooper). Meanwhile Jeremy spends much of his time trying to avoid the lovestruck Gloria and her gay brother. As the films romantic lead Owen Wilson plays it straight. That leaves Vince Vaughn with all the funny scenes and he pulls most of them off. When Vaughns on screen at least during the first 60 minutes theres a chance Wedding Crashers will deliver a laugh. Wilson is just boring. Worse theres no chemistry between him and his perky co-star Rachel McAdams. McAdams (The Notebook Mean Girls) is delightful but she and Wilson never click making the romance that is central to Wedding Crashers success dead-on-arrival. I have previously stated that predictability isnt necessarily a bad thing in a romantic comedy but the film has to offer something to keep viewers interested. Once Wedding Crashers humor has dried up around the half-way point theres nothing left. All of the good stuff - the raw jokes the bare breasts and the profanity-laden asides - comes early in the proceedings. The only thing left for the final act is an unfunny cameo by someone who we have come to expect more from. Then Wedding Crashers climaxes with a scene thats embarrassing for all involved. If a film is going to be in bad taste at least it should have the decency to follow through on its convictions rather than morph into something else. Director David Dobkin (who worked with Wilson in Shanghai Knights and with Vaughn in Clay Pigeons) has crafted something flabby and mushy. It offers plenty of belly laughs early on but the appeal is short-lived. It would be untrue for me to claim I didnt laugh during Wedding Crashers but the longer the movie stayed on screen - outlasting its welcome by a considerable amount - the less amusing it was. After a promising beginning this movie crashes and burns.

Funny. Owen Wilson? Funny. ""Wedding Crashers""? Im laughing already. But the golden gimmick - two smooth talkers with a road-tested rulebook for invading weddings to pick up girls - is appropriately just a scam to get you in the door. The flick brings two hours of great big sloppy buck-wild laughs by morphing into a cross between ""Meet the Parents"" and ""Some Like It Hot."" As the boys find themselves stuck for a summer-house weekend with a demented family of power WASPs led by a hatchet-faced secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken) who looks as if he could bite the head off a golden retriever whats funniest is that they dont get caught. Instead Wilson that Butterscotch Stallion and Vaughn a used-car salesman of comedy who can sell any gag get stuck with their phony identities while in serious danger of either falling in love or attracting unwanted lust just as Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon once did. Jeremy (Vaughn) is the fast-talking try-anything leader; John (Wilson) the more reflective sidekick who wonders if their tactics are ""I dont want to say sleazy - thats not the right word."" As they roar through the spring wedding reception circuit in D.C. getting the girls is almost too easy These uninvited guests bring their tears in an eyedropper and attract adoring females by dancing with the little flower girls. All that remains to close the deal is a dangerous fake backstory culminating in the words ""We lost a lot of good men out there."" Feeling cocky the lads pretend to be do-gooder venture capitalists as they crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury secretary. The reception is crawling with Secret Service and John McCain (in a cameo). Each guy falls for one of the brides sisters John likes the smart funny brunette Claire (Rachel McAdams); Jeremy the dizzy tiny redhead Gloria (Isla Fisher). Jeremy scores zips up and prepares to flee as Gloria turns weird ""I got a stage five clinger"" he moans. But Claire has a boyfriend so John panting to continue the pursuit makes Jeremy accept Glorias invitation for both to visit the terrifying Treasury Secretary Clearys summer house. As Cleary Walken wisely plays it straight channeling Robert De Niros stony tough guy in ""Meet the Parents"" while Jane Seymour is even funnier as his surgically renovated wife. Ogling John in a football game she tells him ""Its hot out here. You should have played in your underwear."" Jeremy is also getting some hot unwanted action from the secretarys gay son who pays him a night visit looking a bit like Edward Scissorhands. By day Jeremy gets a football-field pummeling from Claires testosterone-addled boyfriend (Bradley Cooper) who gets some large laughs as a preppy gorilla. The script funnier than ""Old School"" and less ridiculous than ""Dodgeball"" has so many quotable lines that it amounts to a Delta House Bartletts. The DVD will be as vital to fraternal life as Molson beer and ""SportsCenter."" These days most broad comedies handcuff themselves with a PG-13 rating which is like inviting a Mormon to your bachelor party. Freed by their R the wedding crashers talk the way single guys actually talk (fake-sweet to women lovingly abusive to each other). And the sex jokes harken back to what now look like the pre-code days when anything could happen as in ""Stripes"" and ""Caddyshack."" Vaughn and Wilson do cool insincerity as well as anyone since Chevy Chase and Bill Murray chased skirt. Hollywood should keep pairing them until we get sick of them.

Plotting their next move Owen Wilson left and Vince Vaughn are two buddies on the make in Wedding Crashers. New Line Productions But you can thank the family of oddballs led by Christopher Walken for bolstering the films middle hour -- probably the reason this spotty farce has been enjoying advance buzz of above-average decibel count. And this is in a movie year when sustained laughs have been few. Think of all the loopy eccentrics Walken has played and then look at the clan his character in Wedding Crashers has sired. The tally Just about the number of jokers youd expect to get from shuffling the deck of the actors screen gene pool. After a funny opening scene that establishes the two leads as divorce mediators we come to understand the significance of the title. Just as a character in Mike Nichols underrated and funnier What Planet Are You From? (2000) hung out at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings to pick up women Vaughn and Wilson do so at weddings. And for the same reason Their targets are at their most vulnerable. About the movie Wedding Crashers   1/2 (out of four) Stars Vince Vaughn Owen Wilson Rachel McAdams Christopher Walken Isla Fisher Jane Seymour Director David Dobkin Distributor New Line Running time 1 hour 59 minutes Rated R for sexual content nudity language Opens Friday nationwide Masters of identity duplicity at receptions the two dance their way into bridesmaid sexcapades in one of the years randier screen montages before hitting the wall. The daughter of Treasury Secretary Walken is getting married and she has two sisters. The one played by The Notebooks Rachel McAdams melts Wilsons heart and thus a philandering scheme is foiled. The movie hits its peak when the two buds get invited to the familys summer home. Another sister (Isla Fisher stealing the show as a presumed innocent) hooks up with clueless Vaughn and in the movies most discussion-inducing scene gives him a protracted crotch massage under a packed dinner table. A weird brother (Keir ODonnell ripe for the mad hunchback role in a Frankenstein remake) hits on Vaughn as well. And mom Jane Seymour (looking as if she swallowed a Dr. Quinn youth potion) beckons Wilson to feel her new breasts and well who wants to be a rude guest? These R-rated rompings are absolutely welcome and may be enough to ensure a midsize hit. But Crashers slumps badly in the stretch when the filmmakers have to find a way to surprise us when were fully aware of where the story is going. The solution is to bring on a surprise cameo by the screens most currently overexposed actor. He crashes the movie and the subplot he brings with him saps its strength though it doesnt kill a premise that could have delivered even more.

"Wedding Hardly Takes The Cake washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Wedding Hardly Takes The Cake Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 15 2005 REMEMBER In life there are always things to be grateful for. So what can you draw from ""Wedding Crashers"" a caper comedy starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn? Uh okay for one thing Ben Stiller (Wilsons evil twin in terms of comedy overexposure) isnt in the movie. Its possible he was too busy conducting research for the next sequel to ""Meet the Fockers."" For another the movie has some Washington scenes for us yokel locals to enjoy. We see these landmarks all the time. But as soon as they appear on the screen well holy Nationals in the World Series were suddenly validated But best of all I would direct your attention to the hilarious Mr. Vaughn. As Jeremy Klein a cad who crashes weddings for those available single women hes a cad and a half. And he can motormouth like a machine gun spraying men women and children with manic rat-a-tat outbursts of toxic insincerity. Its often dirty yes. But its also manic and inspired. A quick rundown Jeremy and best buddy John Beckwith (Wilson) look up hot wedding announcements in the paper do perfunctory research on the wedding party and guests then figure out an angle. Are they brothers this time? Are they businessmen? Who in the party are they ""related"" to? Anything to get them in there and hitting on the talent. Women at weddings well youve heard the deal on them. Jeremy and John just rake em in. But when the scoundrels crash the big-time Washington wedding party for the daughter of Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary (Christopher Walken) things change. John falls a little too sincerely for Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams) one of the secretarys daughters. And Jeremy gets in a little over his head with another Cleary daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher) who soon declares her undying bunny-boilingly permanent love for Jeremy forever. It would injure me mentally to describe any more of the plot but lets just say ""Crashers"" is an excuse for Wilson and Vaughn to forge a tag team of cute and rude. Theyre both good at what they do and they work well together. As for the movie think of it with no more lofty regard than a good stick of gum. Pop it in your mouth chew on it for a while and enjoy the very temporary sweetness. And when the movie gets all romantic on you its time to spit the thing into the trash. Or return it to the video rental store. WEDDING CRASHERS (R 119 minutes) -- Contains nudity sexual scenes obscenity and slapstick violence. Area theaters.

So Ill go with boobs to describe the naked anatomy on display however briefly in Wedding Crashers an unabashedly jiggly bawdy its-all-good comedy about a couple of guys who love getting laid. Bare boobs flashed in good fun in an R-rated comedy without concern for children or politicians or morals police Ha not only have the terrorists not won but the rights of an adult audience to laugh at good jokes about erections have been secured for another summer. Truly it feels like a long hard time since moviegoers have tasted a piece of this pie in which guys leer girls giggle and no one gets hurt or produces a firearm; its been such a dry spell in fact that the retro hetero 70s-style raunch of Wedding Crashers feels new again modernized by the neo-retro-hetero duo of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as champion skirt-chasers. In the scenario written by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher directed by Shanghai Knights David Dobkin with relaxed understanding that on-screen chemistry is what happens between dialogue cues best friends Jeremy (Vaughn) and John (Wilson) love the swordsmans life so much that the two have made a specialized after-hours career of wangling their way into strangers weddings the better to pick up chicks susceptible to the romance in the air and the champagne in their glasses. The prologue of this funny ungirdled romp -- a buddy picture about buddies who actually know what women want (and worldly women who know what they want too) -- is a montage of past nuptials. Here the boys relive a few of the triumphs at which they successfully united and conquered. A Jewish celebration followed by Italian and Chinese and Irish wingdings -- John and Jeremy know that the way to score in any culture is to look like its the last thing on their minds devoting themselves instead to entertaining the children schmoozing with the oldies and showing their vulnerable side to the ladies. Swingin hors-doeuvres-stuffing garrulous Vaughn makes expert use of his off-the-cuff chow-it-down guy-to-guy solidity and his ability to get the whole room dancing (hes the first one up for a good hora) while Johns foolproof moves include twirling chastely with little flower girls (Wilson a vision of frosted hair and smarmily sincere gestures) in a way sure to be noticed by nearby compassionate bridesmaids. The two meet their matches as they must; every horndog has his day. Crashing the haute Washington D.C. festivities for a daughter of the U.S. secretary of the treasury (Christopher Walken the go-to man to play crackpot fathers when Robert De Niro is busy) John falls for one of the brides two sisters (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy is waylaid by the other (Isla Fisher). And the movie becomes a comedy of mixed intentions culminating in a goofy cameo appearance by a comedian famous for his old-school impersonations as the long-in-the-tooth swinger who taught Jeremy and John all the intricacies of wedding crashing in the first place. What the boys learn of course is that for mature men the mating games more fun with a partner one cares about the next day. What we learn is that the pairing of Vaughn and Wilson is a success to do a matchmaker proud.

While neither a full-throated R-rated romp a la ""Theres Something About Mary"" nor a fully realized romantic comedy ""Wedding Crashers"" contains enough appealing elements of both to catch the bouquet in whats been a relatively humor-deprived summer. Pic starts slowly peaks in the middle and cant quite sustain that energy through to the satisfying finish but there are enough laugh-out-loud moments for New Line to toast to healthy traffic down the aisles. A too-long montage (one of a few) introduces John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn) two divorce arbitrators who have mastered the art of crashing weddings an event that causes female attendees to ""throw their inhibitions to the wind."" Their well-practiced routine is full of carefully plotted approaches -- from dancing with the flower girl to expressing their fondness for Oprahs book club -- for capturing womens vulnerable hearts just long enough to entice them into bed. Thats all a prelude however to the main event The wedding of the daughter to a well-connected Washington politico Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken at about two-thirds speed) where John gets struck by the proverbial thunderbolt upon seeing the good secretarys other daughter Claire (""The Notebooks"" Rachel McAdams). Jeremy meanwhile seduces a third daughter Cleary (Isla Fisher) though the love-em-and-skedaddle act gets thrown for a loop when John accepts a weekend invitation to the Kennedy-esque clans vacation home hoping to extend his chances of wooing Claire away from her pugnacious boyfriend (Bradley Cooper). What proceeds is fairly amusing fitfully over the top and -- in a series of gags about the Cleary girls creepy brother (Keir ODonnell) -- occasionally a touch homophobic. Most of the gags are drawn from the playbook of rich folks eccentricities from the foul-mouthed grandmother to the horny matriarch (Jane Seymour) who takes a ""The Graduate""-like pass at seducing John. Jeremy meanwhile endures an increasingly bizarre array of indignities from a full-contact game of touch football to a memorable under-the-table dinner sequence that takes ""Goodbye Columbus"" up a couple of notches. Director David Dobkin and writers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher have the wedding trappings and psychology of the ceremonial seduction down pat but theyre on less assured footing in selling the John-Claire romance. Fortunately McAdams is such a beguiling presence she helps fill in narrative gaps and actually creates a real character -- a rarity for females in one of these lad-mag escapades. While Wilson spends much of his time pining Vaughns rapid-fire dialogue yields most of the comedic highlights from labeling a woman a ""Stage 5 clinger"" to his hushed reverence toward the fellow who originated the wedding crashers art leading to the inevitable (and after the first glimpse pretty ho-hum) celebrity cameo. Walken has too little to do as the powerful-but-doting dad while Coopers boyfriend is such a sneering cartoon its a little too easy to root for Claire to dump him. And while its mentioned more than once that Wilson and Vaughn arent that young they probably are a tad old for this brand of shenanigans especially since they conveniently encounter so few husbands and boyfriends as obstacles. Yet even with those minor gripes -- and the larger one that the movie like many a wedding drags on a bit too long -- its mostly an agreeable ride with a deftly assembled soundtrack and even a rather sappy message about true love underlying it all. Indeed ""Wedding Crashers"" real secret is that despite flashes of nudity crudity and mockery of womens raging hormones at the first sight of a trousseau at its core its just a big pushover with the heart of a chick flick.
