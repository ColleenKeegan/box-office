This is where crime-fighting superhero parents like mega-strong Commander (Kurt Russell) and his (aero)dynamic wife Jetstream (Kelly Preston) send their kids to be tutored. Because both Commander and Jetstream are superempowered their son Will (Michael Angarano) should by genetic rights be an ultrahero. But he isnt - in fact hes as normal as most Earthlings; something hes keen to hide from his proud father. Mike Mitchells frenetic Disney live-actioner plays fast and loose with the superhero concept and never takes itself too seriously. Harry Potter and The Incredibles are the first things that spring to mind; Wills father is essentially a live-action version of Mr Incredible (for which Russell hams it to the hilt). A light-hearted and easy-going riot; the kidsll love it - just dont let them try any of this at home.

Former Wonder Woman Lynda Carter left plays a high school staffer. Below Will hangs with the popular Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) under the watchful eyes of Kevin McDonald in ""Sky High."" (Photos By Suzanne Tenner -- Disney) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 29 2005 John Hughes and DC Comics are paid loving homage in ""Sky High"" a rambunctious noisy and generally appealing action comedy aimed at young teenagers and the elusive and hard-to-please audience known as their parents. With one foot planted in the world of comic book fantasy and the other firmly stuck in the grim realities of high school this is one of those rare family films that truly work for the whole family even if Mom and Pop might find themselves needing earplugs during some exceedingly long and loud passages. The premise is a good one. Fourteen-year-old Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) has grown up the son of two famous parents Josie and Steve Stronghold (Kelly Preston and Kurt Russell) who are star real estate salespeople by day and world-saving superheroes well also by day. The conceit of ""Sky Highs"" world is that extraordinary powers arent secrets here; good and bad guys wear their outsize abilities on their big shiny sleeves. The Strongholds have proved to be the worlds greatest superhero couple and theyre looking forward to Wills starting as a freshman at Sky High School where teenagers are taught to hone their particular talents so that the family can become a superhero troika. Sky High it turns out is much like regular high school except that its bullies have the advantage of being able to stretch bend and burst into flames at the most inconvenient moments. Whats more as becomes clear during the schools humiliating ritual of dividing students into heroes or sidekicks Will doesnt possess any discernible powers unless you count ingenuity and virtue. Once he is shunted into sidekick class young Stronghold must figure out a way to break the news to his parents while he navigates Sky Highs complicated social scene which includes an attractive popular Queen Bee named Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and a smoldering--literally--outcast named Warren Peace (Steven Strait who could pass for a young Antonio Banderas). As with comic book fantasies such as ""The X-Men"" in ""Sky High"" grappling with superpowers is an apt metaphor for the confusion of puberty when hormones surge with bewildering force. Director Mike Mitchell working from a script by Paul Hernandez Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle exploits those parallels with finesse but the filmmakers are also interested in the way everything else is magnified in a 14-year-olds life -- whether its the pressures of parental expectations intra-group competition or the predations of a typical adolescent girl who as everyone knows possesses powers far more lethal than anything Stan Lee could dream up. (Like such recent family classics as ""Holes"" ""Spy Kids"" and ""Freaky Friday"" ""Sky High"" is sweet but never condescending in its depiction of youngsters inner lives.) ""Sky High"" features an enormously likable teenage cast including Angarano (most recently seen in ""Lords of Dogtown"") Strait and a lovely newcomer named Danielle Panabaker who plays Wills sweet and socially conscious best friend (she thinks the whole superhero-sidekick dichotomy is fascist). But by far the most rewarding humor in ""Sky High"" comes from the adults who are usually portrayed as fatuous self-important blowhards. ""Kids in the Hall"" alums Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald as well as veterans such as Cloris Leachman and former ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter play Sky High personnel with a delightful wink and a nod. But its Russell who has the most self-deprecating fun here as he puts on his best ""Incredibles"" voice to portray Wills insufferably self-satisfied dad. ""Sky High"" ultimately delivers a commendable message about the importance of integrity courage and friendship. But its packed with enough pumped-up fights and special effects to disarm a teenagers saccharin-detection system. And parents who want to tag along could do a lot worse. Sky High (105 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for action violence and some mild profanity.

Smartly written and sprightly played ""Sky High"" satisfies with a clever commingling of spoofy superheroics school-daze hijinks and family friendly coming-of-age dramedy. Comparisons to ""The Incredibles"" are inevitable though not entirely apt but this lively live-action Disney release stands on its own merits as a tongue-in-cheek fantasy with cross-generational appeal. Pic could prove a surprisingly powerful performer in the late-summer B.O. sweepstakes and will subsequently fly off shelves in homevid release. In developing their high-concept premise scripters Paul Hernandez Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle borrow concepts and archetypes from various corners of the Marvel and DC comic-book universes. (X-Men and the Legion of Super Heroes are only the two most obvious inspirations.) Fanciful scenario can be enjoyed as both a savvy homage brimming with wink-wink inside jokes and as a straight-ahead action-comedy about gifted teens training to join the ranks of superhumanity. Its never easy for the offspring of celebrities to establish their own identities. But for 14-year-old Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) its especially difficult to emerge from the long shadows cast by his dynamic parents the fantastically strong Commander (Kurt Russell) and the high-flying Jet Stream (Kelly Preston). When not battling evil theyre real estate agents Steve and Josie Stronghold. With mom and dad fully expecting him to join the superhero biz Will reluctantly begins his advanced education at their alma mater Sky High a lavishly appointed school on a secluded campus miles above the ground. (Thanks to anti-gravity devices the entire campus remains permanently aloft hidden by convenient cloud banks.) In many ways its a high school like any other complete with peer pressures and polarized cliques. The big difference is the primary division isnt between jocks and geeks. Rather freshmen are labeled as either Heroes or Sidekicks according to their abilities and potential. Will almost immediately is designated as a Sidekick with little hope for reassignment because despite his bloodline he evidences no sign of being superpowerful. Helmer Mike Mitchell (""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"") subtly handles the scripts metaphorical allusions to adolescence as a time of uncertainty evolution and establishing identity. Instead of belaboring the obvious he plays for laughs keeping the pic light even during elaborate action sequences. As a Sidekick Will feels at ease with other dweebs Layla (Danielle Panabaker) who reins in her powers to control plant life in order to remain Wills classmate; Ethan (Dee-Jay Daniels) who can melt into a puddle; Magenta (Kelly Vitz) a shape-shifter who alas can only shape herself into a guinea pig; and Zach (Nicholas Brown) who can glow like a nightlight. On the other hand Will cant avoid clashes with Warren Peace (Steven Strait) who can toss fireballs from his fingertips -- and who nurses a grudge against Will because the latters parents arrested Warrens super-villainous father. Under the watchful eye of shape-shifting Principal Powers (former ""Wonder Woman"" Lynda Carter) and the demanding tutelage of high-decibel Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) Will eventually discovers his super strength. Beautiful classmate Gwen Grayson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) cant help but notice. However Layla isnt pleased that her old friend is being a mite too friendly with someone else. Narrative is fueled by the mischief caused by a vengeful villain who targets the Commander Jet Stream and other Sky High alumni. But funniest bits of ""Sky High"" have relatively little to do with its serviceably comic-bookish plot. Slyly self-satirical perfs by Russell and Preston are consistently delightful and various oddball touches trigger guffaws of assorted intensity. In addition to spot-on contributions from Carter and Campbell funny character turns by Dave Foley (as a former teen sidekick) Kevin McDonald (as a brainy science teacher) and briefly Cloris Leachman (as a nurse with x-ray vision) increase the laugh quotient. Angarano hits the right notes of sincerity and uncertainty while making an engaging impression. Supporting roles are vividly played with Kevin Heffernan a standout as a gung-ho but super-powerless bus driver for Sky High (portrayed in a bold stroke of casting by Cal State U. Northridge). Overall tech package is sufficiently first-rate to providing some semblance of credibility while sustaining seriocomic tone. (Even f/x tricks are laced with humor.) Costume designer Michael Wilkinson has created a lineup of nifty superhero attire and music supervisor Lisa Brown has assembled a bevy of covers of well-chosen 80s pop hits.

That is when his character isnt -- hold on -- selling real estate. Kelly Preston and Kurt Russell play superhero parents who send their superhero son to a superhero high school in Sky High. Buena Vista Pictures Well a computer wore tennis shoes once upon a time at Disney and this harmless family comedy with welcomely loopy asides is in that ""old-school wacky"" tradition. Its complete with an antiseptic teen lead (Michael Angarano) who wont be graduating to Eugene ONeill very soon. The real estate gig is a cover for married superheroes (Russell and Kelly Preston) who have long flown around nipping havoc in the bud. Now son Angarano is ready to attend their celestial alma mater. For a movie about a high school that is grooming superheroes to deliver it had better offer some fun around the edges. Otherwise this premise recalls the mid-1980s when every other release had a title like Weird Science and was directed by a Spielberg wannabe. (Related video Watch the Sky High trailer) About the movie Sky High    (out of four) Stars Kurt Russell Kelly Preston Michael Angarano Danielle Panabaker Lynda Carter Director Mike Mitchell Distributor Walt Disney Running time 1 hour 38 minutes Rated PG for action violence and some mild language Opens Friday nationwide Sky wears down resistance with Cloris Leachmans one-scene comic gem as the school nurse and Wonder Woman Lynda Carter herself as the school principal. And its clever to take the standard ""cool"" and ""nerd"" high school subcultures and transform them into ""heroes"" and their ""sidekicks."" The plot turns on Angarano high-hatting sidekick buddies and falling for the wrong girl (every high school movie has its constants) after belatedly developing superhero powers. This turn of events also leads a skirmish that suggests a human version of BattleBots. Compared with Blackboard Jungle and Rebel without a Cause from 50 years ago were seeing the high school movie in serious decline. But viewed as a family movie in the year of Sharkboy and Lavagirl Racing Stripes The Pacifier and a rusted-out Herbie movie the payoff is almost as cute as Preston in a cape.

The film depicts a ... more Photo HO Sky High sets records for tacky costumes and derivative plots 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Sky High Action comedy. Starring Kurt Russell Kelly Preston Michael Angarano and Danielle Panabaker. Directed by Mike Mitchell. (Rated PG 102 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The problems with ""Sky High"" are obvious from the first moments. Start with the ""Power Rangers""-quality special effects too many similarities to ""The Incredibles"" and an Id-rather-be-anywhere-else acting job by Kurt Russell whose awkward line readings must be linked to Disneys decision to stuff him in one the most god-awful costumes in superhero movie history. But the film is so harmless and the young actors try so hard that its difficult not to have some fun. Parents wont love ""Sky High"" like a Pixar film but theyll appreciate the fact that there isnt a single flatulence joke and when the superteens throw a party nobody drinks alcohol or hooks up in the spare bedrooms. Along with the heroes and villains high school hijinks and sappy father- son moments ""Sky High"" director Mike Mitchell also takes time to reference John Hughes carving out social castes at an island-in-the-sky school and playing roughly half the ""Sixteen Candles"" soundtrack. Its one of the films only original concepts The superkids are separated into hero and sidekick roles in the same arbitrary way that you might have been sent to honors classes or shop. Michael Angarano plays Will Stronghold a freshman starting his first day at the school for teens with superpowers -- even though he doesnt have any yet. Stronghold lives a seemingly perfect life as the son of the Commander (Russell and seriously his costume is awful) and Josie Jetstream (Kelly Preston) who both put pressure on him to succeed. Instead Will becomes a sidekick and falls in with childhood friend Layla (Danielle Panabaker) and a few more of the hottest-looking nerds in history before feeling the lure of the popular kids. Meanwhile in a story line thats almost nonexistent until the final 20 minutes some generic villains are plotting to destroy the school. The movie is cluttered but that becomes part of its charm. The best scenes come when the students reveal their powers to the drill-sergeant demands of Bruce Campbell as Coach Boomer. The sidekicks in particular are entertaining One girl can do nothing but turn into a gerbil while anothers power is the ability to glow a nice shade of yellow. If that sounds a lot like ""Mystery Men"" well it is. As a matter of fact ""Sky High"" may set a record for ripping off more movies in just over an hour and a half than any other film in history. Before the end youll recognize ""The Incredibles"" ""X-Men"" ""Thunderbirds"" and a surprising amount of ""Pretty in Pink."" Thankfully no one told the young actors that the script was derivative or that the special effects would look second-rate. Angarano Panabaker and newcomer Steven Strait as a human torch (add ""Fantastic Four"" to the list of influences) launch into their love triangle with gusto and all give winning performances. Some of the teacher roles including Dave Foley as a washed-up sidekick and Kevin McDonald as a dude with a huge head will also amuse preteen audiences. But for the most part the movie flies highest when the adults are offscreen. Russell in particular doesnt know what to make of his role or his supersuit which may have been intended as kitschy but just makes him look old and sad. Thankfully his role is smaller than it appears in the promotional posters. This movie is about giving the kids what they want whether its the young men and women onscreen or the ones who will be sitting in the theater. -- Advisory This film contains scenes of mild violence and some obscenely tacky superhero costumes that may be offensive to fashion-sensitive members of the audience.

It would have been a mildly impressive feat had this tale about high school freshman Will Stronghold the only child of a superhero couple pulled off its various ambitions. After all the screenwriters combined a high school flick with a superhero adventure with a family comedy about meeting parents expectations. This is what ""The Incredibles"" might have looked like if it mated with the ""X-Men"" and had one of ""Fantastic Fours"" mutated genes thrown in for effect. No X-ray vision is required to see where ""Sky High"" is headed from the time young Will (Michael Angarano) frets about being powerless to the climax in which his outcast friends take on evil. All the high school personalities are here. The mean-girl cheerleader (played by twins) can multiply herself into a squad. When the frosh arrive they are hazed by Lash and Speed two gifted geeks who were no doubt kicked around by senior superheroes before them. ""Evil Dead"" cult figure Bruce Campbell plays a typical bullying P.E. teacher. Sonic Boom is in charge of divvying the frosh into superhero or hero support classes. Or as he he calls the latter with smug satisfaction ""sidekicks."" A kid turns himself into a stone man. Hero. Another turns herself into a guinea pig. Sidekick. Another a puddle. Sidekick. This sounds cuter on paper than it proves on screen. Before Wills superpower kicks in the son of the Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston) gets assigned to ""sidekick class."" There Mr. Boy (Dave Foley) once the Commanders sidekick advises them to ""remember you are responsible for the safety of your superhero as he saves the world"" In a casting reversal that is surely unintentional ""Sky High"" is loaded with personable adults. From Russell and Preston playing Wills concerned and all-too-human superhero parents to ""Kids in the Hall"" alum Foley and Kevin McDonald the oldsters bring relaxed goofiness to the movie. Its the teen actors who arent up to the task of saving this movie from mediocrity. Only Steven Strait in his feature film debut as glum Warren Peace holds the screen. The brooding high school hunks dad was a supervillian now in prison thanks to the Commander. Warrens powers include a stony expression meant to keeps kids away in the cafeteria. He can also hurl fire. Honoring its high school hierarchy conceit ""Sky High"" imparts lessons about outcasts and acceptance that may offer tiny revelations for younger audiences. For the rest of us there is one moment of some clarity. In a backhanded compliment of heroic proportions the Commander thanks the sidekicks. It seems some superheroes never completely shed their supersized egos.

"Disneys Sky High is shiny but silly - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Disneys Sky High is shiny but silly By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 29 2005 Sky High"" is a squeaky clean family-friendly comedy that merely sounds like an unreleased Cheech and Chong romp. Set at a high school for superheroes that literally floats in the sky (why its all the way up there is anybodys guess) the movie sweetens the teen angst thats been known to break out like a case of acne in the best comic books.This being a Disney joint the psychological stress and internal struggles are replaced with such boilerplate urgencies as whom to take to the homecoming dance and at which cafeteria table to sit. The difference is that the 14- and 15-year-olds worrying about these problems can lift cars with one arm turn into rodents and melt into a puddle of goop. Otherwise this is indeed another teen flick a spotty stodgily directed though occasionally clever one with several cardboard performances. (Lynda Carter for instance plays the principal and she just sashays through on her good TV reputation. When will acting become a super power?)Michael Angarano plays Will Stronghold the son of the worlds most famous superheroes the Commander and Jetstream (Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston). Their earthly guises are real estate agents -- um super real estate agents -- living in the suburbs. Will is about to start at his folks alma matter Sky High but on the bus flight to school he worries that he hasnt yet discovered his powers. The school is split into two tracks heroes and sidekicks and his failure to demonstrate a power lands him among the geeky sidekicks. This irks his gung-ho father who fights crime in a bulky red white and blue costume that makes him look like a sexy Popsicle.Will discovers his power (super strength like his pa) during a cafeteria brawl with the school rebel a flamethrower named Warren Peace (Steven Strait) whos mad that the Commander put his bad dad away. Will is bumped over to Sky Highs hero wing and reluctantly leaves his outcast friends behind now that hes cool. Even the most popular girl a technopath"" named Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is falling for him. (That the It girl is someone who can control electronics with her mind seem wishful. Where I went to school we called her nerd."")But Gwen butters up the Strongholds and tricks Will into having a rager while his parents are on assignment. What follows is one of the least convincing house parties ever filmed. The director is Mike Mitchell -- a name I never thought Id type again following the Ben Affleck turkey Surviving Christmas"" -- and the superhuman circumstances do nothing for his moviemaking. Kids at that party stand around indifferent to the watery Radio Disney covers of 1980s pop that leaks from the speakers. This folks is our in-crowd. But the party -- and hopefully its lack of rage -- is a ruse Gwen has concocted to humiliate Layla (Danielle Panabaker) Wills childhood best friend and former fellow sidekick who can control plants.Wills eco-girl versus machine-girl dilemma is the movies most inspired development. If Sky High"" were a cartoon -- OK were it a better cartoon -- that relationship might have appealed to Hayao Miyazaki the director of Princess Mononoke"" and Spirited Away."" As it is the film which is probably suitable for 6- or 7-year-olds seems to be aiming even lower. (For starters the adults are turned into babies at one point.)But Russell appears to be enjoying himself and casting Angarano to play his son was a smart choice. He looks faintly like Russell but he also has the blend of sheepishness and confidence that made Russell such a reliable teen star in those long-ago Disney pictures. So if Angarano misses the cut for say an X-Men"" sequel theres probably a new version of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"" ready to rumble down the assembly line.

"Sky Highs Staying Power washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Sky Highs Staying Power Michael Angarano left Kurt Russell Kelly Preston are a family of superheroes in the clever film ""Sky High."" (By Suzanne Tenner) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jane Horwitz Special to The Washington Post Friday July 29 2005 What could be tougher than navigating the Darwinian social scene your freshman year in high school and simultaneously trying to live up to your overachieving parents reps as stellar alumni? Heres what could be tougher living up to your parents reps if they happen to be superheroes and you enter an elite high school for kids of such demigods (so elite it floats in the stratosphere on anti-gravitational thingamabobs) and your own inherited special powers due to arrive with puberty more or less fail to manifest themselves. That would be tougher. Such a tale is ""Sky High"" a slight but sure-footed live-action comic fantasy from Disney. Director Mike Mitchell deftly blends two genres -- the high school romance and the special-effects-laden superhero comic book adaptation -- and manages to spoof yet salute both with a refreshing lack of pretension. Yes he pillages the great 2004 computer-animated lark ""The Incredibles"" by Disneys erstwhile partner Pixar but in forgivable unassuming fashion. ""Sky High"" uses plenty of ""effects"" but many were filmed as live-action stunts and not added later as computer-generated animation (though some were). The result feels surprisingly low-tech and human. The sets look just a trifle cheesy (a cut above the original ""Star Trek"" TV series) and the colors are as bright as a bag of assorted jelly beans. As a kid flick of course ""Sky High"" carries a message. And it is one no one can argue with that despite peer pressure bullying self-esteem issues and all the other delights of high school kids can use the time served there to discover their own strengths and start following their bliss. Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) son of Captain Stronghold (former Disney kid star Kurt Russell in blustering eye-crinkling form) and Josie Jetstream (Kelly Preston) knows his parents expect him to follow in their world-saving path. Unfortunately Will who occasionally narrates the story arrives at Sky High via rocket-powered school bus still minus his special powers whatever they may turn out to be. His best friend Layla (Danielle Panabaker) stays at his side while Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell of the ""Evil Dead"" films) his voice booming to seismic proportion separates kids on the superhero track from those destined to be mere sidekicks. (Layla by the way sets aside her own special powers -- she can make plants grow superfast -- to be with Will. Layla be true to yourself first) Will Layla and their buddies Ethan (Dee Jay Daniels) Zach (Nicholas Braun) and Magenta (Kelly Vitz) land in ""hero support"" class taught by Mr. Boy (funny Dave Foley) still sensitive about his own stunted career. The schools angry young man Warren Peace (Steven Strait) who shoots flames out of his hands has a grudge against Wills parents and takes it out on their son until jet-powered Principal Powers (Lynda Carter -- ""Wonder Woman"" in a designer suit) breaks it up. Other bullies go after him too. Wills luck seems to change when his own powers kick in (well leave their nature secret) and the most popular girl in school (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) smiles upon him. It takes Will a while to recognize the evil plot afoot. He Layla and their real friends with their ""minor"" powers (Ethan melts Zach glows Magenta morphs into a rodent) must step up. The younger actors all avoid ham-acting and their more seasoned colleagues have fun with the witty material -- especially Kevin McDonald as cone-headed Mr. Medulla teacher of ""mad science"" (both he and Foley are ""The Kids in the Hall"" alums) and briefly Cloris Leachman as a school nurse with X-ray vision. Shell know if youre fakin it. ""Sky High"" isnt. SKY HIGH (PG 99 minutes) -- Contains comic book-style mayhem in which no one appears to get hurt rare mild sexual innuendo and toilet humor. Area theaters.

"Sky High | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; sky-high ) Sky High (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Initially Sky High looked like it was going to be one of the summers throw-away movies - a family comedy with suspicious similarities to last years The Incredibles. Imagine my surprise when I discovered that not only is Sky High too good to be considered a mere ""throw away"" but from a pure entertainment perspective it is arguably the most enjoyable motion picture of the season. Sky High is funny smart energetic subversive and has a few substantive things to say. Theres nothing on director Mike Mitchells dismal resume to indicate he was capable of crafting such a welcome diversion. There is a little of The Incredibles to be found in Sky High but thats not where the cinematic connections end. Other allusions include X-Men Harry Potter Spy Kids and Cant Buy Me Love. The script credited to a trio of writers (Paul Hernandez Bob Schooley Mark McCorkle) succeeds at the tricky task of lampooning a genre while also becoming an entry. The writing is sly and knowledgeable and chock full of ""in"" jokes and witticisms in categories ranging from character names (""Warren Peace"" - say that aloud) to set design (Bat-poles) to throw-away lines (Lynda Carter saying ""Who do you think I am? Wonder Woman?"") No this isnt Tolstoy and despite the ""Warren Peace"" its not intended to be. But it is perfect for the mood of the film which is one third comedy one third action and one third drama. And with no sex or profanity and only a little in the way of cartoon violence its appropriate for the whole family. The central character is Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) the 14-year old son of the worlds two most revered superheroes Commander (Kurt Russell) and Jetstream (Kelly Preston). In costume they repeatedly save the day while hiding behind their secret identities as mild-mannered real estate agents. For Will its time to start high school at his parents alma mater Sky High - the learning center for people with superpowers. Joining Will is his best friend Layla (Danielle Panabaker) who has an affinity for plant life. But theres problem - Will hasnt shown any signs of superpowers and this gets him placed in the ""sidekick"" class. While there he has little chance of attracting the girl of his dreams Gwen Grayson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a senior with an affinity for technology. And it doesnt help that one of his teachers Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) doesnt like him. How can Will survive without powers living in his parents shadow and how can he find a way to tell his mother and father the truth about his non-existent abilities? And what happens when Commander and Jetstreams arch-enemy hatches a diabolical plan? For a film as effervescent as Sky High frequently is the characters are surprisingly well developed. And there are lessons to be learned. Wills experiences with different high school cliques (""heroes"" and ""sidekicks"") are allegorical and illustrate themes that many pre-teens and teenagers can relate to (alienation rebellion etc.). A subplot that has Will turning his back on his friends when the lure of fame and status beckon recalls the storyline of the 80s teen comedy Cant Buy Me Love. The lesson is the same popularity is fickle but true love and friendship last forever. There are plenty of opportunities for laughter in Sky High and I wont ruin the surprise of discovery by cataloguing them here. The soundtrack is strong (although there are quite a few covers) with many of the songs used in inventive ways. (Spandau Ballets ""True"" being the most striking example.) The real-life difficulties of being a superhero while raising a family are acknowledged but not overplayed. This does not feel like a rip-off of either Spy Kids or The Incredibles. The special effects are solid - believable when desired and intentionally cheesy when thats called for (such as the robot at the beginning). And the powers of many classic superheroes are represented Spider-Man the Flash Plastic Man the Human Torch the Thing Iceman and Superman. The actors are well-cast. Most of the young thespians are fresh faces with limited experience (primarily in TV projects). Michael Angarano Danielle Panabaker and Mary Elizabeth Winstead top a list of strong performers who capture the essences of characters that are more compelling than one might anticipate. Steven Strait is suitably James Dean-ish as Warren Peace Wills nemesis. Better-known actors like Kurt Russell Kelly Preston and the always welcome Bruce Campbell miss few if any notes. And Kevin Heffernan has a small part (as bus driver Ron Wilson) in which he channels John Candy. There have been so many disappointments during the summer of 2005 that upon finding something that exceeds expectations I want to trumpet its existence. One could successfully argue that Star Wars Revenge of the Sith and Batman Begins are more complete motion pictures but its hard to deny that Sky High has more charm. With likeable characters an involving and amusing storyline and solid direction the films appeal is hard to deny. Ignore the lame trailers and give Sky High a shot.

Of those three guess which ideal dominates this harmless tween-targeted cape-capade? Perhaps thats inevitable considering our main character is awkward frosh Will (Michael Angarano) son of the Commander (Kurt Russell) a genial meathead strongman and his gravity-defying soul mate Jetstream (Kelly Preston). Like all good superfamilies they send their boy to Sky High a supposedly competitive hero academy thats a bit too Disneyfied to be Hogwarts-cutthroat. The school is distinguished principally by its location several miles above the earth. (Now thats busing.) At first Will exhibits no ""hero"" powers disappointing his dad and he takes his place among the second-class ""sidekicks."" Then he hits superpuberty and gets caught up in a teen caste system inflated to superheroic proportions. (The results are either Day-Glo cute or darkly Nietzschean depending entirely on your own scars.) Naturally theres a supervillain and naturally lessons are learned mostly via brute force. Reverse-imagineered from Spy Kids with a hint of the (ahem) incredible Sky deals skittishly with that status question ending on an ""Im okay youre okay"" note. Visually it aims for Best Power Rangers Episode Ever with a Styrofoam aesthetic that looks like it fell off a truck bound for Spencer Gifts. The flick is best in its bittier moments (watch for the stellar cameos) and theres nothing to trouble the tots. But parents beware When American fantasies of excellence start looking this flimsy you may get the sinking feeling that somewhere over India or China there floats a Sky Higher.
