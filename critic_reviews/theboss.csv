In Gilmore Girls she found a way to make Sookie the shows ""ditzy chef"" warm rather than cartoonish. In Mike amp; Molly she proves that ""relatability"" can also be clever and wry. In Bridesmaids she showed off her mettle with physical comedy. In Spy she proved her deftness with an insult--not to mention a handgun. McCarthy has radiated by turns subtle sweetness and foul-mouthed charisma. She has effortlessly channeled the everywoman. She has done it all charmingly and seemingly effortlessly and quite often hilariously. Like I said national treasure.Related Story The Spy Who Crushed It The latest McCarthy vehicle The Boss has revealed another McCarthy talent the ability to rock a spiky mullet as well as a series of outfits in the style of ""Bedazzled Chicos"" in a way that manages to be as dignified as it is absurd. McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell a self-made tycoon--think Suze Orman meets Martha Stewart meets Tony Robbins meets Tony Wonder--who as the ""47th richest person in America"" is on top of the world ... until a rival gets her busted for insider trading. Shes hauled off to minimum-security prison Stewart-style for a few months--only to discover upon her release that the SEC has repossessed her assets and frozen her accounts. Newly penniless if not newly humbled she shows up at the Chicago apartment of her former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and Claires tween daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) and the two reluctantly take her in.Michelle takes Rachel to a meeting of her Dandelion (think Girl Scout) troop where she learns to her horror that the girls are regularly selling cookies--at high markups too--without directly profiting from the effort. Michelle after happening to sample one of Claires ""family recipe"" brownies starts a spin-off business Darnells Darlings recruiting her sellers from the ranks of the Dandelions--the sales are door-to-door but this time its brownies serving as the capitalistic baked good. Michelle founds the new group for the same reason she does anything and everything else to make money.The Boss is sketch comedy with none of the lines colored in.This is all its weird specificity not withstanding a promising premise for a wacky comedy a little bit Troop Beverly Hills a little bit Bad News Bears a little bit--via a balletically violent street fight between the Dandelions and the Darlings whose uniforms channel Che Guevara but whose motivations channel Donald Trump--Reservoir Dogs. But its a lot to balance. And The Boss for all the star-power the film has behind it--indeed for all the Melissa McCarthy it has behind it--cant seem to decide what kind of movie it is. Or even what kind of comedy it is. Is it bringing heart to slapstick the way those other McCarthy vehicles Spy and The Heat did so effectively? Is it bringing slapstick to heart a la Bridesmaids? Its unclear. Instead The Boss is a whiplash-inducing muddle pratfalling one moment and heartstring-ing the next.The only thing that is very very clear The movie revels in its R rating. It takes gleeful snickering often sneering pleasure in its ability to swear and otherwise be-potty its mouth. Michelles former mentor Ida (Kathy Bates excellent but also sadly underused here) refers to Michelle as ""a businesswoman a visionary a leader"" and also ""a cocksucker"" and ""a professional fuckface."" Michelle at one point hisses to an adversary ""Youre a real B-I-T-C-U-N-T."" She announces to Claire ""Im going to give you a raise so big youll cream your jeans and shat your chaps."" There is much more in this vein but you get the idea.  The movie also takes childish delight in swear-saying of a more figurative variety. Michelle and the guy who sold her out to the SEC Renault (Peter Dinklage) used to date; we get lots of scenes of them acting on their continued attraction to each other--scenes supposed to be hilarious apparently because of the differing proportions of the actors involved. One of The Bosss other long drawn-out gags finds Michelle and Claire feeling (and squeezing and slapping) each others breasts--the point of the whole exercise seeming to be the excuse for Michelle to explain to Rachel when the girl inevitably walks in on them ""We were jostling each others bosoms."" There are also jokes about vaginal rejuvenation and the self-tanning of the crotch and ... well again you get the idea. And there is overall a toss-it-to-see-what-sticks tone to the proceedings. (At one point indeed via an unruly sleeper couch the film literally throws McCarthy up against a wall--one of its few non-predictable gags maybe but one too that treats its star like so much human spaghetti.)  Its a whiplash-inducing muddle pratfalling one moment and heartstring-ing the next.Another spaghetti element the many many cliches The Boss relies on for its LOLs. The girls are selling brownies Think theyll set up a stand in front of a weed dispensary? Will a mention of Michelle and Renault dating in the 80s obligatorily flash back to the pair sporting shoulder-padded suits and Flock of Seagulls-esque hairdos? Will Michelle while babysitting Rachel decide that the two should watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre together? Yes. And yes and yes. Will the film have a lot of fun at the expense of a bitchy wealthy suburban mom? Will there be jokes about tennis lessons at Michelles minimum-security prison? Will Michelle an orphan have intimacy issues? Will the movie make those issues clear by having her repeat a version of the line ""families are for suckers"" approximately 15 times? Will The Boss try to excuse its own reliance on tired tropes by having Claire inform Michelle ""Youre such a cliche Youre getting close to people so then you have to push them away""? Yes. And yes. And yes. And yes. And yes.The Boss was written by McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone (he directed it as well) and it gives an additional screenwriting credit to Steve Mallory who also collaborated with the pair on Identity Thief and less successfully Tammy. The trio are friends from their Groundlings days; Michelle Darnell is a character who was born in the improv theater. Which makes The Boss perhaps a case study in the many bad things that can happen when improv-ers fashion themselves as screenwriters You get a few moments of very funny set pieces--and many more slightly funny ones--that are all strung together awkwardly and discordantly. You get characters who being designed not really as full people but rather as animate vehicles for lines like ""I dinged my pelvis again"" never get fleshed out. You get motivations--minds changed hearts opened vendettas erased inexplicably but always conveniently--that dont make much human sense.The broad arc of the movie--that thing sometimes referred to as ""the story"" sometimes also as ""the point""--exists it seems only to get us from one pratfall to another. The seams show. Or they would if there were any seams at all. Instead the scenes here are glued and taped and safety-pinned sloppily. The Boss is sketch comedy with none of the lines colored in.The girls are selling brownies Think theyll set up a stand in front of a weed dispensary?In that it certainly isnt the only recent film to fall victim to sketchs sketchiness. Given the massive revolving door thats been built between the studios and the SNL stage and the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater the remarkable thing is how many comedies have managed to escape it. What makes The Boss especially disappointing though--really disappointing in the manner of the kid whod do so well if hed only apply himself--is how much potential it had to be awesome. One of the other things McCarthy is great at is managing to get comedy out of the smallest subtlest moments (see in The Boss Michelles awed earnest perfectly delivered what-is-this-foreign-foodstuff assessment of the ""Doh-REE-toh""). And The Boss to its credit repeatedly confirms what Spy suggested There is at this point no one better at delivering a cinematic insult than its star. ""Youre dressed like someone who grocery shops at CVS"" Michelle informs Claire and the line is elegant and cutting and glorious.But many of her insults are aimed not at Claire but at the young girls who are loyal Dandelions. We are meant to understand that these girls are terrible and thus that they deserve to be terrorized by a middle-aged woman former tycoon; in its haste to get to the next pratfall though the movie never really establishes their badness. ""Youre such a loser"" one of them mutters at Michelle after shes taken over a Dandelion meeting and mocked the organizations entire purpose; this is about the extent of it though. In response Michelle spends the rest of the movie referring to the tween girl as a boy and informing her about her future lesbianism--news to the girl it seems--and otherwise bullying her. The treatment extends to the girls mother the requisite bitchy suburbanite whom Michelle at one point tackles on a street in order to gleefully grind some Dandelion cookies into some awkward places.These are not proportional responses. Just as it is not a proportional response when Michelle given bad news by her lawyer beans him in the face with a tennis ball.That wouldnt matter; comedy neednt be realistic. But they contribute to the tonal flaws of the film and they also reveal in their way something bigger the weird mostly unwarranted delight The Boss takes in its own meanness. Michelle the star of the movie is a jerk and thats fine; the trouble is that we are meant to find the movies manifestations of her jerkiness--insulting young girls punching their mothers etc. etc.--to be funny. Had The Boss been better executed they might well have been. But theres a fine line between being a boss and being a bully and the movie regularly crosses it. And then for good measure it falls down some stairs.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

A self-made millionaire (McCarthy) paroled from federal prison after serving time for insider trading moves in with her long-suffering former assistant (Kristen Bell) and sees dollar signs in the womans preteen daughter whose troop is preparing for its annual cookie sale. Kristen Schaal is perfectly cast as the daughters mousy troop leader and Kathy Bates makes an inspired if too-brief cameo but what might have been a razor-sharp satire is rendered mushy and dull by the patchy script the sloppy editing and Ben Falcones limp direction. Dinklage is awful as the foppish villain and aside from one uproarious ad-libbed riff McCarthy seems to be on autopilot.

With writer/director Paul Feig shes found some of her greatest success from her breakout in ""Bridesmaids"" to the runaway hit of ""The Heat"" to last years surprise ""Spy."" Then theres her husband Ben Falcone a fellow alum of the Groundlings Comedy theater with whom she co-wrote and he directed ""Tammy"" and now ""The Boss."" While the Feig films are more tightly and traditionally structured with a high joke density the Falcone films have proven to be loose and profoundly weird with room to indulge in strange bits and riffs. Thats not necessarily a bad thing if youre in the tank for McCarthys specific brand of character-driven physical humor. In both ""Tammy"" and ""The Boss"" McCarthy and Falcone take high-concept characters of McCarthys -- both rambunctious women-children who enjoy rap music and flouting the law -- and set them free in a lightly sketched out cinematic world.Kristen Bell Melissa McCarthy Aleandra Newcomb and Eva Peterson in ""The Boss."" The movie opens Thursday at Regal West Manchester Stadium 13 Frank Theatres Queensgate Stadium 13 and R/C Hanover Movies. (Photo Universal Pictures)Plot In ""The Boss"" McCarthy plays Michelle Darnelle a cold-blooded no-holds-barred wheeler and dealer and the ""47th wealthiest woman in America."" Michelle has a penchant for high turtlenecks flowing tunics and dirty-mouthed smack talk honed in the halls of Wall Street. She gets popped for insider trading by her lover-turned-nemesis Ron/Renault (Peter Dinklage) and after her time in the clink ends up on the couch of her former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). Its there that she cooks up her new business venture with the help of Claires daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) -- starting up a girls troop the Darnelle Darlings selling brownies and giving the girls a cut of the profits. Hijinks ensue.Melissa McCarthy Kristen Bell and Ben Falcone in ""The Boss."" The movie opens Thursday at Regal West Manchester Stadium 13 Frank Theatres Queensgate Stadium 13 and R/C Hanover Movies. (Photo Universal Pictures)The structure of ""The Boss"" doesnt quite work and the transitions between acts are wonky as all get out. But there are nuggets of hilarity to be found. One of the funniest moments comes before the opening titles when Michelle raps her version of DJ Khaleds ""All I Do Is Win"" (complete with T-Pain cameo) during a pyrotechnic-infused financial motivational speech. Its absurd and perfect. Similarly the troop vs. troop street fight is inappropriately funny and ridiculous. The way McCarthy articulates ""Do-ri-to"" like a foreign delicacy or a riff in which she razzes Claires date night sweater are hilarious. While the film allows for these moments those bits are just bits and dont necessarily fit into a larger whole.Top of her game There are some pseudo girl-power messages about taking a leadership role in the business world going after your dreams and empowering young women through financial means. These ideas are interesting especially when Michelle barges in on a boys country club lunch but theyre only half-baked. Similarly the concept of a convicted felon/business shark bringing her skills to a girls troop is a great one but that idea is largely dropped in order to focus on the interpersonal relationships and Michelles rivalry with Ron. As a film ""The Boss"" isnt so boss. The writing doesnt stand up to McCarthys talents and the humor relies more on her delivery and physical commitment than on actual written jokes. But its an opportunity to watch a comedic performer at the top of her game revel boldly in her own confident weirdness. Thats not something you often get to see on the big screen.

Babysitting for Claires tween-age daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) Michelle decides to turn Girl Scout-like cookie sales into big business and then helps Claire boost homemade brownies into a rapidly rising startup--though not without a helping of self-interest. Meanwhile Michelle gets tangled in an unresolved relationship with a competitor and ex-lover Ronald a.k.a. Renault (Peter Dinklage) and the action veers off needlessly into action-caper territory. The movie is all too neat a package for McCarthys exuberantly inventive comic artistry. As directed by Ben Falcone (her husband) the actors are filmed without much attention to comic timing or framing; McCarthys mighty talent needs sharper provocation. With Kathy Bates who delivers wild undertones in grand understatements.      --Richard Brody Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

The funniest moment of Melissa McCarthys disappointing latest has nothing to do with the movies plot a tired one but everything to do with what makes the star so consistently alive onscreen. In the scene McCarthys blowhard business magnate Michelle Darnell is giving dating advice to her dishrag of a personal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) who also happens to be her host since insider trading has left the boss broke. Their exchange starts with merciless sweater mocking moves on to a snippy bra-strap adjustment then blooms into a full-on war of boob slapping. The date isnt important anymore only the battle for dominance. McCarthy needs to spar with someone preferably in close quarters--be it Jason Statham or Rose Byrne in last years underrated Spy or Kristen Wiig in Bridesmaids. Even though The Boss is co-written by McCarthy and her husband director Ben Falcone (who should know his wifes strengths better) the film often strands its title character in shrill one-note caricature mostly unchallenged. Michelle seizes on a Girl Scouts-like baking program Dandelions in which Claires teen daughter participates as the key to her comeback. First you laugh at McCarthys harshness in front of the kids who arent used to her screw-the-competition ethos then you sigh realizing this is no School of Rock. Aside from Michelles half-assed attempt to grow a conscience near the movies end The Boss is filled with dead weight which includes even Game of Thrones Peter Dinklage as Michelles randy business competitor; he never gets to unleash his wit. A weird overabundance of Chicago establishing shots feels unmotivated (production incentives?) as does the impulse to film marauding children in slow motion their savage lessons learned. The Boss almost forgets whos boss but bad McCarthy is better than none at all.

Along with a former employee played blandly by Kristen Bell she engineers a new enterprise selling brownies via a middle school girls troop conspicuously not named the Girl Scouts.

Like Spy Tammy and Identity Thief before it pesky details of plot and character in The Boss feel like mere set dressing for what she does best on a big screen filling approximately 90 minutes with high-wire comedic riffs and fresh ways to conjugate profanity. Here McCarthy stars as Michelle Darnell a brash Fortune 500 CEO with a burnt-apricot bouffant a truckers mouth and a truly epic collection of face-framing turtlenecks. Brought down for insider trading by a bitter ex (Peter Dinklage twirling his metaphorical mustache) and reluctantly taken in after a white-collar prison stint by her badgered ex-assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) Michelle quickly rediscovers her purpose--money fame more turtlenecks--by commandeering the cookie sales of a Girl Scout-style troop Claires young daughter belongs to. A few moments are fantastically bonkers but granting director duties to McCarthys husband Ben Falcone feels more like an act of love than wisdom. In his hands the story wobbles and weaves and finally topples--a Boss with no boss or boundaries to rein it all in.

For years McCarthy has enlivened other peoples movies - ""Bridesmaids"" ""This Is 40."" She co-starred in the popular TV show ""Mike amp; Molly."" Her own comedy vehicles -- ""Spy"" ""Tammy"" ""The Heat"" -- made a lot of money. Too often though the films got their laughs by making fun of her. MORE Melissa McCarthy on fashions size problem Even the ones she and her husband Ben Falcone had a hand in always fell back on easy fat jokes. You could argue she was taking control of the issue getting her audiences to laugh with her instead of at her. Except McCarthy didnt seem to be laughing. It was sad and it was sexist. Men from Zach Galifianakis to Louis C.K. were able to make comedies that didnt use their pants size as the go-to punchline. Why couldnt McCarthy? Shes since slimmed down a bit. And perhaps as a result ""The Boss"" mostly concentrates on the actress talent showing off her flair for physical comedy and peerless gift for improvisation. Also her resolve to delve deep into an off-putting character and stay there as long as it takes. Here its Michelle Darnell a Trump in pumps with an empire of diverse holdings and national fame as a self-help author. Then quite quickly Michelle loses everything. Everything except a thirst for revenge and a fearless determination to get every penny back. Michelle is an unapologetically rude and greedy heroine and luckily the humor all comes from there not from McCarthys size. (Although weirdly she spends the entire movie wearing turtlenecks that practically come up to her bottom lip - if this is Michelles embarrassment at a double chin the joke never pays off and if its the stars its a shame.) McCarthy is great fun to watch though - a pure unchecked id who owns the screen whether shes funking out at a rally bodyslamming an enemy or cavorting with a boytoy. McCarthy actually created this character back in her old improv days and you can feel her enjoying the chance to take Michelle even further. Unfortunately theres nothing here beyond Michelle. The script is thin and the supporting characters dont offer much support. The plot such as it is - Michelle decides to take her former assistants brownie recipe and turn it into an industry - is barely there. Kristen Bell is squeaky but unforgettable as Claire the former assistant and Tyler Labine - who looks like a failed James Corden understudy -- is even more superfluous as Claires boyfriend. At least as Michelles current business adversary and former lover a mad millionaire with a samurai complex Peter Dinklage swings for the fences. But by the time of the big finale - which features a burglary ravenous Dobermans and a swordfight - the movie isnt so much going for broke as simply broken. Still McCarthy is great - foul-mouthed funny and fierce. And for those of us who suffered painfully (yet hopefully) through things like ""Identity Thief"" the movie feels like a healthy step forward. We like you Melissa. Were glad to finally see a movie where it feels like you do too. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations substance abuse and violence. The Boss (R) Universal (99 min.) Directed by Ben Falcone. With Melissa McCarthy Kristen Bell Peter Dinklage. Now playing in New Jersey.   1/2 Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 08 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Apr. 08 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Ben Falcone Written by Melissa McCarthy Ben Falcone Steve Mallory Starring Melissa McCarthy Kristen Bell Peter Dinklage Classification 14A Country USA Language English The Boss is not a Bruce Springsteen biopic and the critics are not bellowing ""Bruuuce"" they are booing. Rightly so for this is a lazy Melissa McCarthy vehicle that relies on relentless potty-mouth moments - its so funny when otherwise decorous characters continually do the vulgar - and the pratfall comedy of McCarthy. She plays a meanie mogul whose thrice-orphaned childhood drives her monstrously self-centred will to dominate. When her empire crumbles shes hapless at being humble. Though a cast that includes Kristen Bell and Peter Dinklage does the best it can theres nothing sane with which to work. A little-girl street brawl tiredly relies on slow-motion; a samurai-sword finale is just plain dumb; and a sofa-bed sight gag is only half-funny so lets do it twice because thats the math of a hack which is what director actor and co-writer Ben Falcone is. Though Falcone who is also McCarthys husband must at least get credit for showing his face on screen.

Fire this movieAfter getting out of prison for insider training The Boss Melissa McCarthy right torments assistant Kristen Bell.(Photo Hopper Stone / Universal Studios)Melissa McCarthy needs to leave her husband.Professionally speaking not personally. Perhaps McCarthy and Ben Falcone have a lovely loving marriage worth preserving. But when they team up on screen their union is a failure.""The Boss"" is the second clunker in a row theyve churned out together following 2014s ""Tammy."" Like that film Falcone directs from a screenplay they both wrote and it similarly wastes the considerable talents of McCarthy on a half-baked premise that seems to be based on a title and an idea for a poster not a story.McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell a flashy loudmouth self-help guru who loses her fortune when her rival and ex-lover Renault (Peter Dinklage) busts her for insider training. After serving a brief prison sentence she moves in with her put-upon personal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and tries to get back on her feet while learning the value of family and friendship.The lone highlights are all McCarthy; scenes where she verbally abuses Claire while wearing a teeth whitening mouth gag or goes into temporary paralysis while eating a puffer fish prove shes one of the screens funniest stars. But its not enough to carry the film and ""The Boss"" never feels like more than a series of bawdy R-rated sketches held together by bubble gum and masking tape.Since her ""Bridesmaids"" breakout McCarthys career has been up (when teaming with ""Spy"" and ""The Heat"" director Paul Feig) and down (every other instance).Feig knows shes elevated when there is a solid structure around her.

(Hopper Stone) Mark OlsenContact Reporter It is hard to think of a movie squandering the opportunity of a perfectly timed cultural moment quite like ""The Boss."" The film stars Melissa McCarthy as a motivational speaker mogul and financial self-help guru who loses everything after going to jail for insider trading and is determined to claw her way back to the top.Just imagine the filmmakers good fortune in tapping into issues that appeal to people on both sides of the current political divide. In the right hands ""The Boss"" could skewer the brash ambition and entitled certitude of a Donald Trump type and the desire to see all that dismantled and discarded by Bernie Sanders-style supporters. But these are not the right hands. Melissa McCarthys The Boss deserves a trip to HR and a pink slip Hopper Stone Michelle Darnell (Melissa McCarthy left) and Claire (Kristen Bell) lead their Darnells Darlings in the new film ""The Boss."" Michelle Darnell (Melissa McCarthy left) and Claire (Kristen Bell) lead their Darnells Darlings in the new film ""The Boss."" (Hopper Stone) Directed by Ben Falcone the films script is credited to Falcone McCarthy and Steve Mallory. (McCarthy and Falcone are married.) They are blatantly not interested in the very things that could give their story bite; rather they prefer to focus on the emotional redemption arc of having McCarthys orphaned character Michelle Darnell learn to let other people in emotionally. Out of jail and with nowhere to go she imposes herself on former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and Claires adolescent daughter forming a nascent family for the very first time.McCarthys screen persona is more complicated than it seems on the surface. The combination of her gifts for physical comedy and improvisational dexterity along with her ability to quickly shift and home in on emotional beats is difficult to capture. Paul Feig who directed McCarthy to her best work in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""Spy"" has been able to bring out an elegant harmony in McCarthys performances. Here as in their previous collaboration on the needlessly ugly ""Tammy"" Falcone tends to indulge her extremes resulting in something that feels disjointed. The press notes for the film say that McCarthy first came up with the character of Michelle Darnell years ago while a member of the Groundlings comedy troupe in Los Angeles. This may explain why the story doesnt sync up the character to the current cultural mood but what is more curious is how the filmmakers chose to structure their story. There is really very little time spent on Darnell in her prime so her fall isnt felt very strongly. Most of the film is occupied by her plan to create a new fortune by selling Claires homemade brownies as a partially for-profit girls club-fundraising enterprise. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story A riotous street fight between rival baked goods factions feels lifted straight from the ""Anchorman"" movies perhaps not surprising given that those films masterminds Adam McKay and Will Ferrell are also producers on ""The Boss."" But when McCarthy clotheslines an adolescent girl the humor suddenly drains from the situation. The movie isnt fantastical enough to sustain itself outside the bounds of reality yet every time something real creeps in the movie stumbles and cowers.The film has no genuine interest in the way business works or exactly how a low-stakes charitable endeavor is transformed into something much larger. It just happens. The finale involving the retrieval of a signed contract from a business rival (played by Peter Dinklage) is utterly nonsensical on multiple levels. The picture ends on a call-back to an earlier joke that feels strained and desperate as if the filmmakers were scrambling to wrap up a story they knew they hadnt successfully concluded.Even given all that the movie is not without its charms and moments. An early scene between McCarthy Bell and Cedric Yarbrough has a liveliness and self-aware absurdity that is missing from much of the rest of the film. (Yarbroughs energy as McCarthys yes-man feels fresh but the character is jettisoned far too soon.) One of the films funniest scenes comes when McCarthy attempts to help Bell dress for a date. There is a discussion about boobs and bras that is at once outrageous and revealing the kind of disarming humor that the movie could use a lot more of.

""Since nobody really wants... (Nardine Saad) There is no way to predict where lightning might strike or how to catch it in a bottle. The recently concluded TV miniseries ""The People v. O.J. Simpson"" captured and crystallized the current state of the nation better than anyone might possibly have imagined. Need McCarthy and Falcone have turned in a satirical treatise on wealth ambition and what really matters in life? No but they might have created a movie that was about something that dared to dig deeply into ideas they prefer to only timidly skim by rather than this soft disappointing and scattershot effort.

The setup Melissa McCarthys paroled business mogul Michelle Darnell has recruited a group of schoolgirls to abandon their cookie-selling troop to join her nascent brownie-selling enterprise. Michelle and her girls are selling brownies door to door on a quiet Chicago street when they encounter the cookie troop and some of their moms. R-rated insults are exchanged. And then I kid you not the moms and the daughters and Michelle the convicted business mogul engage in a full-on brawl complete with slow-mo acts of violence chops to the Adams apple adults throwing children to the ground a car set on fire and Michelle taking a batch of cookies and jamming it into the pants of the woman leading the cookie group. And Im holding back with that description. Maybe this is supposed to be some kind of junior high girl-power statement but like just about every scene in ""The Boss"" it comes across as ugly mean-spirited and tone deaf. In earlier scenes McCarthys character insults one young girl by calling her ""he"" and disses another by saying shes destined to become a lesbian when she grows up. Hilarious. Im such a fan of so many of the principals in this movie starting with McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone who co-wrote and directed but this was a dreadful viewing experience from the awkward and unconvincing setup to the desperate performances to the depressingly unfunny slapstick scenes to the conflicts and resolutions you can see a mile away. What. Were. They. Thinking. The prologue tells us McCarthys Michelle was a lonely unloved child who was returned to an orphanage every five years or so. Cut to present day. Michelle is now the 47th wealthiest woman in America and shes such a dynamic presence she can fill the United Center with one of her get-rich seminars which apparently consist of her rapping poorly and telling the wildly cheering audience they have to believe in themselves and make sure nobody pulls them down. Peter Dinklage who can be great in the right role (""The Station Agent"" ""Game of Thrones"") but terrible when he overdoes it in comedies gives maybe the worst performance of his career as Renault a business tycoon obsessed with taking down Michelle. Renault provides the feds with evidence Michelle has engaged in insider trading and Michelle is sent to prison and stripped of all her wealth. Because this is one of those movies where the main characters have no siblings parents or close friends when Michelle is released from prison she looks up her former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) a single mother now working in a dead-end job. Claire has a precocious Movie Daughter named Rachel (Ella Anderson). Michelle becomes something of a mentor to Rachel (thats how we get to that execrable street fight scene) and she starts to think of Claire and Rachel as family -- until we get to the inevitable and arbitrary parting of the ways. How many films have we seen where the romance or the friendship is going swimmingly and then all of a sudden one of the parties gets gun-shy and disappears leaving behind a note and gearing us up for the musical montage of everyone living their separate lives? Ugh. As Ive said before even broad comedies should exist in a world that seems somewhat connected to the real world. The Chicago of ""The Boss"" the characters in ""The Boss"" and what happens to everyone in ""The Boss"" are beyond cartoonish. As was the case with ""Tammy"" McCarthy has taken a character she created years ago for the improv troupe the Groundlings and developed her into a full-fledged movie character. I would respectfully suggest she not return to that comedic well for a third outing. I wouldnt be surprised to hear Michelle Darnell was a hilarious onstage comedic creation. On film she is a flimsy one-dimensional tiresome character surrounded by equally unconvincing and unfunny players.  Universal Pictures presents a film directed by Ben Falcone and written by Falcone Melissa McCarthy and Steve Mallory. Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (for sexual content language and brief drug use). Opens Friday at local theaters.

The Boss puts Melissa McCarthy rudely in charge review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Boss puts Melissa McCarthy rudely in charge reviewAnybody who thought Melissa McCarthy wasnt in charge of her own rude destiny can take ribald comedy The Boss as proof shes fully behind the wheel of the clown car.Melissa McCarthy stars as The Boss with Kristen Bell as her sidekick.  (Hopper Stone / Hopper Stone/Universal Studios via AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. April 7 2016The BossStarring Melissa McCarthy Kristen Bell Ella Anderson Peter Dinklage and Tyler Labine. Directed by Ben Falcone. Opens Friday at GTA theatres. 99 minutes. 14AAnybody who thought Melissa McCarthy wasnt in charge of her own rude destiny can take The Boss as proof shes behind the wheel of the clown car.After starring in 2014s profitably puerile Tammy for her director husband Ben Falcone with whom she also shared writing and producing credits it seemed she was finally ready to stop acting like a human whoopee cushion.Article Continued BelowSt. Vincent and Spy followed shortly thereafter confirming her abundant comic gifts with characters that were funny and simpatico without being insufferable. Is it possible that McCarthy missed playing loud and vulgar? The Boss finds her back to her old tricks all dressed up and without a trailer park in sight but as tediously over-the-top as in excesses of old. Falcone again directs and co-produces with sledgehammer finesse. He and McCarthy share screenwriting with Steve Mallory who has known them since their days as Groundlings sketch yuksters.McCarthys ribald and self-entitled Michelle Darnell is just Tammy in designer duds and immaculate makeup. Michelle screwed over her former lover (Peter Dinklage) and mentor (Kathy Bates) while en route to becoming the 47th richest woman in America.The ex-lover retaliates by getting Michelle jailed on an insider trading rap. She emerges from the slammer penniless and friendless but the script lazily conspires to have her move in with her too-nice former assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and Claires preteen daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson).Not to worry mom and daughter have a killer chocolate brownie recipe that Michelle is going to franchise to make them all rich although trust friendship and a rival Girl Scouts-style group called Dandelions might get stomped in the process.This takes all of about 30 minutes to set up with the remaining hour of the film spent on increasingly silly and lewd hijinks until its time for the unearned resolution. Did you ever think only male comics could obsess over infantile boob crotch and sex jokes? The Boss will set you straight on that delusion too.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Hopper Stone Universal Studios MOVIE REVIEW The Boss Running time 99 minutes. Rated R (language). Its the rare movie heroine who has the ovaries to take down the Girl Scouts. As a former financial titan forced to start over Melissa McCarthy (""Spy"") is at her best when sticking it to the Dandelions a Scout-esque troop dedicated to selling cookies and earning badges for dubious designations like ""social butterfly."" ""Next week Im thinking maybe theyll arrange marriages"" she mutters and launches a rival brownie-hawking troop whose logo as co-star Kristen Bell observes has a sort of Communist Japan-Black Panthers aesthetic. Its a shame ""The Boss"" co-written and directed by McCarthys husband Ben Falcone doesnt run with this conceit. What could have been ""Role Models""-type raunch with a girl-power mantra is instead only a sporadically amusing vanity project. It isnt all bad. The film was produced by Will Ferrell and Adam McKay which makes sense Like Ferrell McCarthy is intrinsically funny capable of transcending subpar material with a single tilt of the head or tumble down a flight of stairs (one of McCarthys specialties). Here shes Michelle Darnell an financial self-help guru who goes from being ""the 47th wealthiest woman in the country"" to an insider-trading convict. Upon her release she leans on former personal assistant Claire (Bell depressingly underused) for a place to crash. The film seems unsure how to view Michelle. We are meant to believe shes ruthless loathed by her peers deserving of being brought low by the indictment (arranged by her jilted ex played with minimal effort by Peter Dinklage). But theres an inherent sweetness to McCarthy that Falcone cant (or wont) tamp down rendering her more fabulous than fearsome. The versatile Bell meanwhile is sentenced to straight-man status as Michelles long-suffering single-mom assistant. The film admirably assembles a roster of funny women then mostly squanders their screen time. Cecily Strong of ""SNL"" gets zero comic traction as Bells overbearing boss while Kathy Bates plays Michelles mentor a wealthy horse-farm owner who drops a couple of F-bombs then mounts up and rides away. Its awkward. Kristen Schaal is the painfully nice Dandelions leader a one-note role for this absurdist comic. Annie Mumolo (co-writer of ""Bridesmaids"") plays a contentious Dandelions mom who gets into it with Michelle. At least these two have a semi-engaging series of squabbles one of which leads to a rumble between troops that sees kids cursing and fighting dirty leaving a neighborhood street decimated and on fire. McCarthy shines when loosely riffing but the plot tightens around her like a vise. A third-act caper in which Michelle Claire and Claires love interest (Tyler Labine) face off against Dinklages Renault is sloggy; you can sense all parties wishing they were elsewhere. The end credits (which also include outtakes) feature some great retro-looking pages from a fictional handbook ""Darnells Darlings For Enterprising Young Women."" Could someone make that into a movie instead?

Crude gags mingle with squishy underdeveloped messages in the new comedy For a comedian who comes on like gangbusters Melissa McCarthy has had a rocky time finding the right vehicle for her unfiltered raucousness and zingy timing. Last years Spy came closest McCarthys co-stars--Rose Byrne Jude Law and Jason Statham--helped tease out unexpected grace notes from her audacity in overdrive. But The Boss directed by her husband Ben Falcone who also helmed Tammy isnt boss at all. McCarthy plays brassy big-business tycoon Michelle Darnell who after serving time in prison for insider trading moves in with her former assistant (Kristen Bell) and her young daughter (Ella Anderson). The plot involves setting girls up in the brownie-selling biz to earn money for college. Crude gags mingle with squishy underdeveloped messages about family and belonging and empowerment. And while self-abasement is part of the comedians toolbox theres something depressing about watching as a chortling Michelle airs her unmentionable area while spraying herself with self-tanner. McCarthy deserves better than this. She can aim higher. This appears in the April 18 2016 issue of TIME. Tap to read full story Order a Reprint Read Next Your browser is out of date.

Slideshow The Boss Melissa McCarthy is brilliant movie isnt Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon That sounds damning as if the baseline of this movie is already firmly set at mediocre which it isnt. Its not great either but it is better than mediocre. Blame the marketing campaign which made it look as if McCarthy was in full-blown character mode (think Identity Thief) rather than her more grounded comedic persona as in the excellent Spy. The Boss is a little bit of both McCarthy types. She plays Michelle Darnell the 47th wealthiest woman in the country. The movie opens as she hosts an arena-filling seminar on how to get rich complete with pyrotechnics dancers and rapper T-Pain. For someone who loves Spy-style McCarthy and hates when she feels this need to go big and mug its a bad sign. Her look doesnt help Michelle has a shock of red hair plentiful eye makeup and a closet full of turtlenecks that would make Diane Keaton jealous. Yet as The Boss progresses its main character doesnt wear nearly as thin as one might expect. McCarthy is such a comedic powerhouse that she can play Michelle with incredible physicality and slapstick while also imbuing the character with wit cunning and even ruthlessness. Michelle ends up being a fun character to watch in a movie that may not be able to support her. Michelle is on top of the world - that is until a rival and former lover (Peter Dinklage) dimes her out for insider trading. After a short jail stint she moves in with her ex-assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and Claires daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) and attempts to get back on her feet. To rebuild her empire she decides to start her own for-profit Girl Scouts-style troop selling Claires brownies. Its a nice premise full of female empowerment atop the rote premise of a loner finding family and community for the first time. But in the third act The Boss falls apart and McCarthy is the only thing keeping it watchable. Thats a testament to her incredible screen presence. With an experienced comedy director - such as Paul Feig who helmed Spy and directed her coming Ghostbusters reboot - McCarthy can do legendary work. But even with a less-talented guy in the directors chair - her husband Ben Falcone directed this one as he did 2014s Tammy - she can still salvage a movie. McCarthy incorporates so many shades and layers into a character who should be irritating propping up a flimsy movie that will most likely be a footnote in her brilliant career. meichelphillynews.com215-854-5909 The BossDirected by Ben Falcone.

Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Melissa McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell an industry titan trying to rebrand her image after a jail sentence in The Boss. Universal Pictures You never see Melissa McCarthys neck in The Boss. This is the films best joke because instead of being beaten into the ground it goes completely unremarked upon. The fiery comedian playing a CEO named Michelle Darnell who puts elements of Donald Trumps mouth under Suze Ormans hairdo has made turtlenecks a permanent part of her wardrobe. This holds true even once shes taken the plunge from top executive of several unspecified companies to sleeping on a former subordinates couch. The turtleneck gag is admirably silly but so slight it never really builds to anything which is just the movie in a nutshell. McCarthy is playing the ""47th-richest woman in the world"" but she must by this point be Hollywoods number-one source of foot-in-mouth disease having time and time again demonstrated to male executives that people will watch female-fronted comedies. Her ability to be coarse and R-rated is already making waves in the industry influencing the heroines of smaller films like The Bronze to get just as nasty. But McCarthy has made her clunkers too like any respectable box-office draw and The Boss has a distinct clunking sound. The premise like that of last years Get Hard is a white-collar spoof. The government seizes Darnells assets after the serpent-tongued hyper-capitalist is arrested for insider trading forcing her to rebuild from scratch with the extraordinarily patient generosity of Claire (Kristen Bell) the assistant she long spurned. Claire is raising a daughter on her own (lovable child actor Ella Anderson) and the three women get to share the spotlight without having to talk about men or shopping. Instead well they talk business. ""First rule of business Pretend to negotiate and then take what you want"" Darnell says. But her movie neither negotiates nor takes many laughs. The Boss has a couple good bits about cushy white-collar prisons and the cult of personality the rich build around themselves but keeps getting sidetracked with easy sight gags and McCarthys familiar taboo-crushing insults which after a while become boring not offensive. Bell is as likable onscreen as ever but shes no true foil to McCarthy in the manner of Rose Byrne (Spy) or Sandra Bullock (The Heat). Darnells big idea to rocket her way back to the top is to compete with the Girl Scouts -- or rather the ""Dandelions"" because this film does not share its protagonists zest for courting litigation. When she learns about the cookie-selling operation of which Claires daughter is a member Darnell sees not female empowerment but free labor. She launches a rival organization called ""Darnells Darlings"" has the girls sell Claires brownies and gives them profits instead of patches. Conceptually this is smart though painting the Scouts as ruthless Samoas-hawking sharks is old hat by now. (They even made it into the Oscars this year.) But again the film fails to build anything grand from this idea. When the girls face off in a turf war they grab each others hair and throw roundhouse kicks and McCarthy clotheslines a teenager. The humor is meant to come from the scenes shock value we gather but the whole thing really just feels ... unpleasant. Like a batch of cookies that came out far too bitter. Following Tammy this is the second co-writing effort between McCarthy and her husband/director Ben Falcone. The Boss keeps to the mainstream comedy rails where Tammy did not; nothing in the storyline direction or character types is remotely fresh. Absent Paul Feig the helmer of McCarthys deliciously entertaining trilogy Bridesmaids The Heat and Spy (as well as her upcoming Ghostbusters remake) the stars talents never seem to spark. The films flaw as a comedy is that it fails to make Darnell whose old office was flanked by larger-than-life portraits of herself a true fish out of water once shes marooned in middle-class Chicago. Being catapulted by a springy fold-out couch isnt a joke on her pampered personality -- its just a joke on the couch. In a movie clearly designed to spark more Bechdel Test-passing onscreen interactions between women it seems a sin to admit the films funniest performance comes from a dude. Peter Dinklage man bun in tow plays Michelles corporate rival and ex-boyfriend who puts his samurai training to use sabotaging her career as his pained face and demeanor betray deep unrequited love. Dinklage steals the show because hes able to sell his character with something deeper than profanity violence and stale jokes about the cartoonishly wealthy. In todays ruthless corporate world you have to bring your A game -- and your turtlenecks.

Robert Hanashiro USA TODAYClaire (left Kristen Bell) gets some fashion advice from Michelle Darnell (Melissa McCarthy) in ""The Boss."" McCarthy headlines the comedy as a titan of industry who is sent to prison after shes caught for insider trading.(Photo Universal Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 2 out of 5 starsMelissa McCarthy is funny. Just by existing -- the way she carries herself spastic with energy swearing with vim - she can elicit a chuckle even when the material doesnt live up to her talent.And does this material ever not live up to her talent. ""The Boss"" written and directed by Ben Falcone McCarthys husband and creative collaborator has crafted for the comedian a high-concept character rich with comedic possibility and riotous social commentary and given her absolutely nothing to do. The script occasionally lets her off the leash for bursts of fun chaos but the sum total is a controlled studio pic with little to recommend it beyond audience fealty to McCarthy and the fervent desire to see her talents put to better use.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Melissa McCarthy is back with more laughs as a ruthless titan of industry ready to make her comeback after serving time in prison. VPCMcCarthy plays Michelle Darnell the 47th wealthiest woman in America and a self-styled financial and lifestyle guru with a short shellacked blazing red Suze Orman coiffure. All ego and brass Michelle packs arenas with working women eager to worship their hero and her venal take-no-prisoners get-rich program. Its as if the aforementioned Orman mind-melded with Martha Stewart and burned away all traces of kindness and empathy. (Not that she doesnt have reason to be so distrusting; an opening montage shows the difficult girl being returned to her Catholic orphanage by exasperated foster parents.)Her empire crumbles when shes sent to federal prison on insider trading charges - an arrest orchestrated by her one-time lover lifelong nemesis Renault (Peter Dinklage). Her mercenary ways have left her short on friends and with her assets liquidated and nowhere else to go she turns up on the doorstep of her long-suffering ex-assistant and single mother Claire (Kristen Bell).RELATED Melissa McCarthy on Tammy Susan SarandonIn the throes of couch-surfing depression inspiration strikes when Michelle takes Claires young daughter to her Dandelions meeting where the Girl Scout-like troupe celebrates their cookie-sales numbers. Michelle wants in on the racket and devises Darnells Darlings a leaner meaner operation with salesgirls dressed like militant communist youth peddling Claires homemade brownies with 10 percent of the proceeds going to a college fund to empower the girls to grow up educated successful women. Its an inspired bid for image rehab and one that seems to be working until someone says the dreaded F-word Family.Melissa McCarthy stars in ""The Boss"" a comedy about a disgraced businesswoman who uses a group of Dandelions selling brownies to rebuild her empire. (Photo Universal Pictures)And that is this movies biggest failing. Michelle Darnell is high-concept irreverent and R-rated while the PG world she inhabits is predictable and feel-good armed with life lessons about building relationships and sticking together.Every other character in the film is a misfire. Claire is such a cipher that not even Bells bubbly charisma can imbue her with any weight or purpose. Kathy Bates is cast as Michelles estranged mentor and given a single brief scene with no gags. And who knows what fever dream gave birth to Dinklages Renault a wannabe samurai with dumb hair a katana collection and an assistant who hand-feeds him milk while he plots taking over the brownie business; its as if they threw a handful of weird quirks in a blender and called the resulting sludge a character.There are brief bursts of hilarity and they are all without exception owed to McCarthys innate charisma and comedic timing. ""The Boss"" does McCarthy such disservice that a crass physical gag of a hide-a-bed hurling her into a wall starts to feel like a metaphor.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

The Boss - the overextended gag starring and co-written by Melissa McCarthy (with her director husband Ben Falcone) - doesnt just serve up McCarthys trademark raunch humour and physicality. It uses it as drywall compound to fill in cavernous craters in story and character. So its not her fault if even she cant produce enough of the stuff. She rattles off rude wisecracks falls down stairs gets flung against a wall by a faulty sofa-bed and talks crude sex talk in front of children. She gives date-boob advice to Kristen Bell in an extended scene of mammary groping. She leads a brawl between rival teams of pseudo-girl guides with hair-pulling and wedgies. Its a mighty effort that earns The Boss a handful of laughs for audacity. Your mileage may vary my wife laughed more. Kind of like a raunchy Troop Beverly Hills (for those old enough to remember the movies of Shelley Long) The Boss is the story of Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) a self-help-style financial whiz (think Suze Orman) who is sent to jail for insider trading and penniless on her release stumbles on a plan to reboot her financial empire by stealing the market share away from the old-school cookie girls. Okay theres some other stuff - characters and plastic sentiment. We meet Darnell in childhood as the one orphan who kept getting returned by adopted families. The homeless Michelle shows up at the apartment of her single-mom executive assistant (Bell) whose daughter she ends up taking to ""Dandelion Girl"" meetings setting things up for her investment Eureka moment. And theres the financial mogul Renault (Peter Dinklage) Michelles ex whos been driven mad by her rejection of him and now fancies himself a corporate samurai. You just know their long-suppressed sexual urges will be addressed - and there WILL be nunchucks and swords. I dont know if groping between a plus-sized woman and a small-statured man is supposed to be a sight gag but there it is. No comic actor ever forged a lengthy career with nothing but classic comedies. From Bob Hope to Eddie Murphy to Adam Sandler theyve filled in their filmographies with slight joke vehicles aimed squarely at fans. For better or (mostly) worse The Boss is one of Melissa McCarthys. Fans will be satisfied. New converts will be few.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Boss"" is not just the title of Melissa McCarthys latest but also the take-charge attitude she brings to the project. Her part allows the actress to stretch turning her hair red her wardrobe high-fashion and her self-confidence stratospheric. Unfortunately world-class gumption and an on-camera look that the pretty committee would applaud cant save a poorly executed comedy whose essential elements are dirty words and falling down. After McCarthys rapturously funny work in ""Spy"" her pratfalls here seem like a reflection of the tangled plot threads tripping her. McCarthys go big or go home assertiveness suggests another option Stay home and avoid ""The Boss"" altogether. The film tracks sassy business guru Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) who loves telling her cheering fans she is ""the 47th richest woman in America"" After a brief term in a luxury prison for insider trading the homeless ex-con decides to rise again through a Girl Scout-like brownie empire. Selling billions of snickerdoodles door to door will net her both a new fortune and revenge against her competitive tycoon and former boyfriend Renault (Peter Dinklage). The mission involves McCarthy using nonstop profanity (a gimmick also used by preteen girls in the kid-unfriendly script she co-wrote) fist-fighting mothers who support traditional cookie vendors and leading her child posse into bone-breaking street scuffles. The greedy entrepreneur occasionally tries to learn family values from a single-mom former employee (Kristen Bell) who took her superior in off the streets. The juvenile yet raunchy dichotomy feels schizophrenic and impossible to market to families. This is shock comedy that despite many charming children crowding the screen is very adult. What a shame. The snippets that have played in the films trailers a folding bed that catapults McCarthy against a wall or her scene wearing a mouth guard that makes her blabber the tricky wordplay of Abbott amp; Costellos ""Whos on First"" made me laugh myself into tiny little pieces. Those moments promise a blissful whole. Instead fellatio jokes and slasher film references fill ""The Boss"" like a bizarre game of Mad Libs. While she has superb screen presence and acting ability McCarthy is incapable of the great storytelling and universally relatable characters that make comedies compelling. She can perform the music but she cant write the songs.

She co-wrote the script with her husband Ben Falcone who doubles as director as he did in Tammy. The result this time is just as hit and miss. But when it hits yowsa. More News Peter Dinklage on SNL 3 Sketches You Have to See Rated XX A Brief History of Female Comedies Melissa McCarthy The Runaway Bridesmaid All Stories >> Related 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 From superhero movies and serious dramas to a new Star Wars movie the years must-sees McCarthy plays Michelle Darnell the ""47th wealthiest woman in the world"" and a ruthless tycoon whom no one weeps for when shes sent to prison for insider trading. McCarthy created the character 15 years ago when she was a member of the Los Angeles improv troupe the Groundlings. And the role fits her like a second skin. On release from jail after four months the bankrupt bossypants -- who covers her neck with collars and bows to the point of distraction -- moves into the cramped Chicago apartment of her single-mom assistant Claire (a wasted Kristen Bell) and her tween daughter  Rachel (Ella Anderson). Michelle treats mom and daughter terribly. She hates the idea of family -- ""its an anchor that will make you sink."" She has her reasons. Flashbacks show the young Michelle as a reject constantly returned to a Catholic orphanage by a series of horrified foster parents. McCarthy doesnt need soggy sentiment; shes better than that. The main plot revolves around the revenge Michele plans against her ex-lover Renault (an outrageous Peter Dinklage) who is also her biggest rival. The two lock horns over building an empire based on selling brownies from a recipe Michelle stole from Claire. It plays even sillier and more strained then it sounds. No need to go on except to say that this R-rated farce includes scenes of McCarthy and Dinklage crossing swords and genitals just not at the same time. The Boss is far from top-tier McCarthy (Bridesmaids The Heat Spy) but itll do till Ghostbusters comes along in July.

"The Boss review Mismanaged comedy doesnt utilize Melissa McCarthys skills - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Boss review Mismanaged comedy doesnt utilize Melissa McCarthys skills Trailer The Boss Watch the official trailer for ""The Boss."" (ScreenPlay) Watch the official trailer for ""The Boss."" (ScreenPlay) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune With her hit TV series ""Mike amp; Molly"" ending in May Melissa McCarthy finds herself exactly where any skillful versatile ambitious comic superstar strives to be in a parallel movie career Her films dont have to be good to find an audience.Lets be clear. McCarthy has made plenty of good ones from the ensemble smash ""Bridesmaids"" (for which she got an Oscar nomination) to the disarmingly sweet and low-keyed ""St. Vincent"" and last years ""Spy"" among others. The key to ""Spy"" was not treating it lazily simply as a showcase for the star and the star alone; everyone snagged a fair share of the laughs some cruder than others. But were not talking about ""The Philadelphia Story"" here. Within its star-vehicle parameters a similar generosity of performance spirit informs McCarthys latest ""The Boss."" But this time the funs theoretical as opposed to actual. The movie likely to unseat ""Batman v. Superman"" at the box office this weekend turns out to be every bit as grating and joyless as the one with the capes.RELATED MOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR Well. Surely you say ""The Boss"" is better than that It had reasons to be better. McCarthy developed the character of Michelle Darnell a motivational financial guru of limited tact and infinite confidence years ago when she worked at LAs Groundlings Theatre with her future husband Ben Falcone and her future writing collaborator Steve Mallory. These three parlayed the Darnell character into the script for ""The Boss"" and Falcone directed it; its his second feature following ""Tammy"" which fell in the not-good-but-successful half of McCarthys resume.In ""The Boss"" Darnell overcomes an orphanage childhood marked by rejection by becoming a finance titan who loves her bling and likes her helicopter pilots shirtless. Shes also an ethical corner-cutter. Nailed for insider trading by her ex-lover and business rival (Peter Dinklage mugging like he invented mugging) Darnell does a few months white-collar jail time and broke and desperate re-enters life in Chicago. The movie was shot mostly in Atlanta where everythings cheaper and none of the streets look like a big city in northeastern Illinois.Heres one problem among many. ""The Boss"" becomes a heartfelt story of makeshift family as Darnell bulls her way into the apartment and the lives of her former put-upon assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and her preteen daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson who has genuine promise). She convinces them to go in on a start-up company selling Claires brownies as a for-profit rival to the so-called Dandelions aka the Girl Scouts by a fictional name.Is that much on which to hang a movie? Not really. And the comic spirit of ""The Boss"" is just coarse. The smackdown competition between the Dandelions and the red-beret-sporting Darlings relies on vicious artless slapstick in between bits such as Darnell spray-tanning her upper thighs or mooning an 11-year-old. People -- millions of them and Im one of them -- like McCarthy. They sympathize when her characters are down and nearly out and they root for her when shes up although its a very close call when shes inhabiting a flagrantly dislikable and strangely indistinct character such as this one. But ""The Boss"" has zero finesse as a comedy. When Darnell crashes into a wall or takes a tumble down the stairs its alarming and painful as opposed to funny. Throughout a preview screening the woman to my right made wincing and air-intake noises that werent quite laughter but rather laughter-esque. Theres a considerable gulf between director Falcones work and the McCarthy films directed by Paul Feig (""Bridesmaids"" ""Spy""; Feig also did the forthcoming ""Ghostbusters"" reboot; fingers crossed).Opportunities for major comic talents who happen to be women remain stupidly limited in Hollywood. As with last years Tina Fey/Amy Poehler dud ""Sisters"" ""The Boss"" puts you in an especially crummy mood because the talent on screen so clearly deserves better material. Funny guys get to make junk all the time; some of its profitable some of it isnt.Melissa McCarthy owns and deserves the same comic rights. For now though her film career is a seesaw and while director Falcone manages at least one funny image -- a little red wagon full of cookies in flames gliding from one side of the frame to the other after the body-slamming melee in the streets -- at the end of ""The Boss"" youre left with a throwaway line ringing in your ears. ""I can sell anything I believe in"" Darnell asserts at one point. Clearly McCarthy believes she can too.Michael Phillips is a Tribune Newspapers critic.mjphillipstribpub.comTwitter phillipstribune""The Boss"" -- 1.5 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content language and brief drug use)Running time 139Opens Thursday eveningRELATED STORIESMelissa McCarthy admits shes not The Boss at homeMelissa McCarthy talks feminism body views in new magazine interview Miles Ahead review Don Cheadles inventive freewheeling slice of jazz legends life Caption Trailer Bad Moms Watch the trailer for ""Bad Moms.""

Claire (Kristin Bell) left and Michelle (Melissa McCarthy) join forces to develop a brownie-making empire in ""The Boss."" Photo Hopper Stone Hopper Stone / Universal Pictures The Boss gives McCarthy little to work with 1 / 2 Back to Gallery ""The Boss"" provides the talented Melissa McCarthy with plenty of scenery to comically chew on -- she is very funny at times -- but the story is paper-thin and the script gives much of the supporting cast the proverbial pink slip. The result is a serviceable comedy thats not on the level of ""Bridesmaids"" or ""Spy"" but certainly a grade above McCarthy movies such as ""Identity Thief"" or ""Tammy."" ""The Boss"" gets off to a hilarious start as foster families keep dumping the young Michelle Darnell back at the convent where Sister Aluminata (Margo Martindale pitch perfect) tries to reassure Michelle that shes still a special child who will find the right family. Then we fast-forward a few decades when Michelle (McCarthy) now a wealthy self-help titan is dispensing moneymaking advice to a packed crowd at Chicagos United Center. The gist of her pyrotechnic-laden presentation Dont let families and other unnecessary things get in your way. Michelles success is quickly derailed when insider-trading charges send her to prison and she loses everything. After her stint behind bars she inexplicably moves in with mousy ex-assistant Claire (Kristin Bell) and comes up with a comeback business idea a brownie empire that would eat into the Dandelions (think Girl Scouts) cookie-selling fortune. Its a subdued plot for an over-the-top character but McCarthy often lights up the screen with a humorous spark wearing a red wig and over-accessorizing herself to the hilt. It soon becomes apparent though that most of the characters around her are too low energy to offer much in the way of additional comic wattage. The prospect of McCarthy sparring with the likes of Kathy Bates (who plays a mentor) and Peter Dinklage (who plays an ex-lover and business rival) seems tailor-made for comedy. But Bates is criminally underused and Dinklages character (Renault) is a snooze stranding Dinklage in never-never land. The pleasant but uninteresting Claire gets a lot of screen time as the straight person to Michelle which only emphasizes the lack of comic chemistry between Bell and McCarthy except for an amusing bra-fitting scene. Faring much better is Annie Mumolo who portrays Helen a stuck-up Dandelion troop leader whos not afraid to stand up to Michelle with some choice insults. In watching the delicious scenes in which McCarthy and Mumolo lock horns we can only wish that Helen served as Michelles chief rival throughout the film. Instead after a memorable street fight with Michelle over cookie-selling territory Helen pretty much vanishes and the film veers into a hostile takeover of the brownie enterprise followed by a ham-fisted office stunt in which Michelle duels it out with Renault. Though Michelles transformation into a family-loving gal is hardly convincing the film still moves along quickly and McCarthy has some memorable moments in which her comic chops are on full display. When she visits a country club to enlist the help of former associates only to be rudely dismissed her tirade is an exquisite mix of vulgarity desperation chutzpah and clumsiness. We see McCarthy at the height of her powers yet without a better script she can only do so much. David Lewis is a Bay Area freelance writer. The Boss Comedy.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet It is the curse of the popular comic actor to be eventually harangued for always playing the same part. This tends to be a reductive criticism for a couple of reasons. For one playing the ""same"" part is how a comic persona develops going all the way back to silent film. For another plenty of comedians have more range even in broad comedies than their reputations suggest. Take Melissa McCarthy star of The Boss and perhaps the most popular comic performer currently working in Hollywood. In her new film she plays Michelle Darnell the ""47th wealthiest woman in America"" who conducts herself with the loud bravado recognizable from other McCarthy comedies. But Michelle has a boisterous arrogance missing from McCarthys character in Spy and a put-together (if ridiculous and turtlenecked) style far removed from her character in The Heat. Apart from some mild inconsistencies about how sheltered Michelles wealth has made her the character is clear and distinct from other McCarthy creations. The weakest McCarthy comedies have resulted not from her recycling her persona so much as bundling together a grab bag of tics into a vaguely familiar but mostly incoherent character.Tammy one of her worst offenders in that regard was co-written and directed by Ben Falcone McCarthys husband and creative partner. McCarthy and Falcone reteam for The Boss with Falcone back behind the camera and co-writing the screenplay with McCarthy and Steve Mallory and the improvement is substantial in that this movie is funny and mostly makes sense. Maybe the characters long history helped the filmmakers get a bead on who she is; McCarthy first played Michelle Darnell during her stint in The Groundlings. Here shes rounded out with a somewhat pat backstory The movie opens with Michelle an orphan being dumped by a succession of foster families before giving up on the idea that a family could help or support her in any way. Years later shes fabulously wealthy as a nebulous sort of businessperson seeming adept primarily at turning money into more money and secondarily at thoughtlessly frustrating her long-suffering assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). When Michelle gets busted for insider trading as part of a takedown of her business rival Renault (Peter Dinklage wonderfully nutty as a man who used to pronounce his name ""Ronald"") she emerges from prison homeless penniless and friendless. Single mom Claire and her little daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) take pity on her and let her crash with them and when Michelle takes Rachel to her Girl Scout-ish Dandelion Troop meeting she gets a new business idea.If this all sounds like a long wind-up to Melissa McCarthy selling Girl Scout cookies its because The Boss story tends to lurch ahead suddenly and does so all the way through a manic heist-driven sword-fight-accented climax. But this silliness plays a lot better here than it did in Tammy and McCarthy gets a lot of laughs. She finds new outlets for her physical comedy (playing a whole scene with a dental brace holding open her mouth into a terrifying sort of grin) and her boundless facility with insults and threats (a McCarthy staple put to great use when she encounters some former colleagues). Shes also supported by an impressive supporting cast that includes Kristen Schaal Timothy Simons Kathy Bates and Cecily Strong. But only Dinklage and low-key straight woman Bell make much impression. Falcone still doesnt offer much behind the camera. With the exception of a sustained Anchorman fight knockoff he often refuses to punctuate visual jokes to such a degree that some of them play more like descriptions of ideas for gags. (Theres a particular surprise appearance of McCarthy that should kill but doesnt.) This wouldnt be a problem if his dialogue scenes had more rhythm; unfortunately they tend to proceed in sluggish back-and-forth set-ups.But comedy perhaps more than any other genre doesnt have to lean on advanced filmmaking to work. A lot of The Boss works because Michelle Darnell is a funny character and McCarthy is funny playing her. And as abrasive as Michelle is supposed to be the movie generates warm feelings (even when Michelle wreaks terrible vengeance on a Dandelion mom played by Annie Mumolo). This may be due in part to the way McCarthys comedies are unapologetically female-centric and often minimize as this one does the obligatory acquisition of a romantic happily ever after. Just dumping that one conceit leaves so much room for the movie to goof around. The Boss without quite reaching the heights of McCarthys work with Paul Feig establishes its star as sort of a comic auteur--which is not the same as repeating herself.

Melissa McCarthy -- sorta Originally published April 7 2016 at 1200 am Updated April 7 2016 at 1103 am Michelle Darnell (Melissa McCarthy left) gets a little cosmetic help from Claire (Kristen Bell) in ""The Boss."" (Hopper Stone/Photo Credit Hopper Stone) ""The Boss"" Melissa McCarthy plays a disgraced billionaire getting back on her feet in this disappointing comedy. 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Moira Macdonald Seattle Times movie critic What a difference a director (and a screenplay) makes. Melissa McCarthy has recently shone in three movies from Paul Feig ""Bridesmaids"" ""The Heat"" and ""Spy"" all of which showcase her goofy comic timing and chirpily likable persona. So why in her second movie directed by her off-screen husband Ben Falcone (written by McCarthy and Falcone) does she have to depend on falling down staircases getting thrown off folding beds and saying raunchy things in front of grade-schoolers for laughs? Like the 2014 Falcone/McCarthy collaboration ""Tammy"" ""The Boss"" puts McCarthy front and center then strands her without a nuanced character to play or clever lines to speak. Here shes Michelle Darnell a Suze Orman-like billionaire finance guru who as the film begins gets sent to federal prison for insider trading. Upon her emergence months later the hard-driving Michelle finds herself with no money and no friends and must depend on her former assistant Claire (a genuinely sweet Kristen Bell) to help her get back on her feet. Theres nothing particularly funny or surprising about how this happens and the films only lingering suspenseful question -- why does Michelle always wear turtlenecks even with her pajamas? Is she hiding a scary tattoo on her neck or something? -- goes unanswered. Meanwhile good performers such as Kathy Bates and Peter Dinklage flit across the screen without leaving a trace and McCarthys trademark blend of chipper likability and treble-voiced rage just isnt quite enough to carry things through. Movie Review 1/2   The Boss with Melissa McCarthy Kristen Bell Kathy Bates Tyler Labine Timothy Simons Peter Dinklage. Directed by Ben Falcone from a screenplay by McCarthy Falcone and Steve Mallory. 99 minutes. Rated R for sexual content language and brief drug use. Several theaters. Who you gonna call? Paul Feig I guess; his ""Ghostbusters"" starring McCarthy comes soon. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Photo Credit Universal Studios / Hopper Stone advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A disgraced businesswoman tries to rebuild her life after prison. CAST Melissa McCarthy Kristen Bell Peter DinklageRATED R (strong language sexual humor)LENGTH 139BOTTOM LINE A hit-and-miss comedy but McCarthy leads a game cast through several memorable moments. Melissa McCarthy plays Michelle Darnelle the 47th wealthiest woman in America in her latest comedy ""The Boss."" Shes so wealthy that she holds motivational seminars in Chicagos United Center. Shes so wealthy that T-Pain is her backup rapper. Shes so wealthy she says ""I had Destinys Child reunite and come over to my apartment just so I could watch them break up again."" That little trilogy of jokes sums up ""The Boss"" a hit-and-miss comedy written by McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone who also directed. Some of the jokes are inspired others squeak by and still others work solely because McCarthy is such an endlessly talented improviser. How many ""so wealthy"" jokes did she run through before picking the best ones? Ten 20 100? advertisement | advertise on newsday Those improv skills are both the strength and the weakness of ""The Boss"" which leans harder on McCarthy than on its script (Steve Mallory is a third writer) for laughs. Michelle an empire builder who loathes emotional attachments -- her motto is ""Cut em off and move on"" -- serves time for insider trading and emerges with no one to turn to but a former assistant Claire (a very good Kristen Bell). The onetime mogul is now a couch potato. That fairly simple premise takes a while to set up because Falcone lets his spouse riff a little too long in each scene. Michelle is a familiar figure of fun the rich snob forced to live like regular folk. Weve seen versions of her in Mel Brooks ""Life Stinks"" about a CEO trying to survive on the street and in the Dan Akyroyd comedy ""Trading Places"" about a wealthy stockbroker reduced to poverty. McCarthy gives Michelle a twist Shes an orphan entirely self-made and angry at the world. That back story allows McCarthy to tug at our heartstrings which is one of her greatest skills. ""The Boss"" feels more than a little unfocused. Michelles upstart brownie empire sold by hostile tween girls in denim vests belongs to a different kind of comedy. Still the movie has moments of inspired goofiness many provided by an excellent Peter Dinklage as Michelles vengeful ex-lover. The fine support cast -- nearly all women -- includes Annie Mumolo Kristen Schaal Margo Martindale and Kathy Bates. MoviesThe movies you have to see in 2016 Women as bosses in filmPlaying the big boss on screen is nice work if you can get it especially if the boss doesnt have to be nice.

WORKING GIRL (1988) -- Sigourney Weaver was delightfully deceitful as an advertising exec who thinks nothing of stealing ideas suggested by her ambitious secretary Tess (Melanie Griffith).

Among the ""do it or youre fired"" tasks she foists on underling Anne Hathaway is to get a copy of the unpublished ""Harry Potter"" novel for her twins because they cant wait to find out what happens next.HORRIBLE BOSSES (2011) -- Jennifer Aniston played a lusty dentist who sets dental assistant Charlie Days teeth on edge by constantly putting the moves on him.-- Daniel Bubbeo Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

An embellished gender-switched variation on Donald Trump avaricious celebrity businesswoman Michelle Darnell is unquestionably the most outlandish creation yet from one of the funniest popular entertainers working today. But McCarthy and her husband Ben Falcone who directed ""The Boss"" and co-wrote it with his wife struggle to develop enough material to complement her slapstick abilities. Shes a great joke in search of a punchline. READ MORE Saturday Night Live Review Melissa McCarthy May Not Be a Five-Timer Yet But Shes Already a Classic Host ""The Boss"" suffers from the opposite problem of the couples previous collaboration ""Tammy"" which attempted a more delicate blend of melancholy and humor -- and wound up lost between the two. With ""The Boss"" McCarthy aims for farce and nails it even when the story falls short of supporting her efforts. One-upping her bumbling crusader in ""Spy"" she unleashes a terrific anti-hero The prologue reveals the countless foster homes that rejected Michelle over the years before unveiling the monstrous result -- a wealthy take-no-prisoners dealmaker who relishes the spotlight and shoots down her competition. Rapping to a stadium of fans before beaming in a sea of falling dollars she boasts of boundless capabilities (""I paid Destinys Child to reunite just so I could watch them break up again at my house"") and announces that shes the forty-seventh wealthiest woman in America. For a while her caricature makes for an endearing buffoon whose triumphant attitude has an air of naughty satisfaction to it. As a de facto statement on the surge of popularity behind the Trump presidential campaign the thrust of the comedy cuts deep. Michelles cocky demeanor carries into banter with her despondent assistant single mom Claire (Kristen Bell essentially playing the straight man) whose demands for a raise yield little more than cheeky condescension. A near-brilliant early bit finds Michelle using a mouth prop while Claire attempts to clean her teeth and winds up getting heckled by her boss in a mangled series of crude remarks. Its the kind of first-rate physical comedy that would have worked equally well in the silent days. If ""The Boss"" mainly just showcased its titles characters ruthless ability to get away with her arrogance McCarthy and Falcone might be on to something. Instead it heads into Frank Capra territory with a familiar twist This is the kind of movie where a mean-spirited scrooge must develop her altruism. Michelles lesson starts when shes tossed in jail for insider trading after her former flame -- and ruthless competitor -- Renault (Peter Dinklage amusingly smarmy if one-note) tips off the SEC. Five months later Michelles released bankrupt and the subject of ridicule across town. Ultimately crashing with her former aide and assisting her middle school daughter (Ella Anderson) to launch a domineering girl scout cookie empire Michelle aims to get her entrepreneurial groove on by introducing a team of pre-prepubescent girls to the joys of crushing your competition. At times Falcone hits on inspired images to complement the movies absurd vision of capitalist lunacy through a feminist lens. A violent showdown with the rival cookie sellers erupts into fiery madness as the uniformed women traipse through the mayhem in slo-mo; Michelles crafty sales pitch to the girls is amusingly well-timed. Toss in a supporting role for Kathy Bates as Michelles devious horseback-riding mentor and ""The Boss"" has plenty of wickedly funny material in its toy chest. READ MORE Why Melissa McCarthy Should Leave Hollywood Behind So why does it shift gears in a middling third act to a meandering heist subplot and a rooftop showdown involving samurai swords? Such crude randomness may be typical of the Will Ferrell-backed Gary Sanchez Productions (which produced ""Daddys Home"" last year) but does a disservice to material that clearly has something more to offer -- in this case the most subversive mainstream figure in American comedy whose gender body type and rambunctious attitude come closer to challenging traditional movie heroes than anything else produced on this scale. Theres no question that McCarthy provides an essential contrast to safer bets but she has yet to uncover material as brashly challenging as her screen presence. Then again even when ""The Boss"" doesnt hold together it maintains an effective critical gaze. As with Trump Michelle is a woman so proud of her competitive instincts that shes unable to comprehend her flaws until they eviscerate her reputation -- which only strengthens her resolve. That attribute also drives ""The Boss"" a movie crammed with underwhelming gags that keep crowding out the talent at their center. Grade C+ ""The Boss"" opens nationwide on Friday.

TWITTER 4/8/2016 Melissa McCarthy plays a business tycoon fallen on hard times in this raunchy comedy directed by her husband Ben Falcone. The title character of Melissa McCarthys new film is one she created years ago during her stint at the Los Angeles comedy troupe The Groundlings so its not surprising that The Boss feels like an elongated sketch. Its an intermittently very funny one to be sure with McCarthy once again demonstrating her expert comic delivery and prodigious gift for physical humor. But its paper-thin characterizations hackneyed plotting and overdependence on viciously profane humor put this effort more in the minor league of Tammy McCarthys previous collaboration with her director/co-screenwriter husband Ben Falcone than her truly inspired work with Paul Feig on Bridesmaids and Spy. The Universal release should continue the talented actresss box-office winning streak but its hard not to wish that she set her artistic sights a bit higher. Her characters traits enhanced by florid outfits and an impressive wig McCarthy plays Chicagoan Michelle Darnell the ""47th richest woman in America"" -- any resemblance to Martha Stewart is strictly coincidental Im sure -- who clawed her way to the top through a combination of street smarts and betrayals of both her former mentor Ida (Kathy Bates) and ex-lover/business partner Renault (Peter Dinklage). Michelles take-no-prisoners attitude is explained via an early montage in which shes seen as a young girl being unceremoniously returned to her orphanage after being rejected by a series of foster families. Now she proudly revels in her ostentatious wealth and abuses everyone in her orbit including her beleaguered personal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell). But when Michelle once again screws over her rival Renault on a deal he spills the beans to the authorities about her nefarious business activities and the Club Fed prison gates clang shut on her for six months. Upon her release she discovers that her home has been taken away and her assets have been stripped leaving her little recourse but to show up at the door of the apartment of Claire and her pre-teen daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson). Claire whos now working at a low-level office job initially resists having her former boss as her houseguest but finally gives in and allows Michelle to sleep on her couch until she can get back on her feet. Reluctantly agreeing to escort Rachel to a meeting of her after-school group the Dandelions Michelle is inspired by their Girls Scout-style cookie-selling operation and hatches a plan to start a rival group ""Darnells Darlings"" to sell Claires delicious home-baked brownies. The venture is an instant success resulting in an intense rivalry between the two groups that leads to a knock-down-drag-out brawl in which the adolescent girls and their adult chaperones mercilessly pummel each other in Sam Peckinpah-style slow motion. Meanwhile Renault schemes to take over the burgeoning business with Michelle mistakenly getting the impression that Claire is in cahoots with him. The ensuing corporate intrigue culminates in a rooftop swordfight between Michelle and her former lover whos still besotted with her. Most of the humor in the film scripted by McCarthy Falcone and their former Groundlings cohort Steve Mallory derives from the shock value of McCarthys character spewing out as many venomous profanity-laden insults as possible. The actress delivers them with a gusto thats infectiously enjoyable up to a point but the law of diminishing returns quickly sets in. Theres also loads of physical comedy with the performer throwing her body (and body double) about with reckless abandon in scenes in which she gets ejected off a sofa bed tumbles down a flight of steps and crosses swords in the aforementioned battle that was presumably funnier in concept than execution. Bell whose Claire is also involved in a subplot involving her budding romance with a besotted co-worker (an appealingly loose Taylor Labine) effectively plays straight man to the outrageous McCarthy even gamely participating in a lengthy routine in which she and McCarthy vigorously grope each others breasts. Dinklage affecting an elaborately put-on accent and donning silly designer clothes has a ball showing off his under-exploited comedic chops although his performance like much of the proceedings in general veers too heavily into caricature. The Boss doesnt even have the courage of its crass convictions devolving into schmaltz as it eventually humanizes its central character who comes to realize that she really wants close emotional connections after all. The sentimental plot development is even more shamelessly contrived than everything thats preceded it.

There are nearly no laughs in this picture and in a movie that bills itself as a comedy usually you can see the performers working for laughs of some kind at least part of the time. In the prologue we see McCarthys character Michelle Darnell sent back to an orphanage three separate times -- in 1975 1980 and 1985 all with appropriate music cues of course -- and Margo Martindales nun Sister Aluminata keeps welcoming her back. This is all done so hastily and carelessly that we dont even find out much about why Michelle is being sent back and this is symptomatic of ""The Boss"" as a whole it isnt comedy and it isnt drama much less comedy-drama. See Video Melissa McCarthy Swears Up a Storm in The Boss Red-Band Trailer We next see Michelle in her adult guise as a financial guru in an overblown stage act that makes her look like a pop star (complete with flashing lights and back-up dancers) preaching the lure of selfish capitalism in an anti-family Ayn Rand style. McCarthy has chosen to wear a red spiky hairdo and a variety of turtlenecks and these two choices are exactly as far as she goes with this character Red hair turtlenecks and corporate overkill none of which McCarthy makes either convincing or funny. In ""The Boss"" McCarthy (who co-wrote with Falcone and Steve Mallory) always seems like a nice wacky lady with bright eyes who you might meet at a bar or family gathering and never a ruthless titan of the business world. When Michelle is put in prison for insider trading and then emerges with nothing but a suitcase and the clothes on her back Falcone decides to put Nina Simone singing ""Nobody Knows You When Youre Down and Out"" on the soundtrack a jarring choice because this movie is so far away from the power and depth of Simones singing voice that you can practically hear the diva growling and swearing from the grave at whoever licensed her vocals. See Video Melissa McCarthy Does DMX Pocahontas During Lip Sync Battle Against Jimmy Fallon Michelle implausibly crashes on the couch with her former personal assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) and Claires daughter Rachel (the very likable Ella Anderson) and this sitcom set-up yields no laughs or even attempts at laughs aside from a bit where McCarthy is thrown at warp speed into a wall from a pull-out couch. With lots of time on her hands Michelle takes Rachel to her Girl Scout troop meeting and of course Michelle immediately takes over and ruffles some feathers. McCarthys talent is for slapstick and bold physical humor and her attempts at verbal comedy sometimes lead her into some very lame places. (For instance an extended riff McCarthy does about one of the girls in the troop probably being a lesbian.) Michelle pulls herself out of her slump by applying her cutthroat high finance background to the selling of brownies baked by Claire and sold by the Girl Scouts who are made to wear red caps and to give a hard sell to prospective customers. This is the strangest section of ""The Boss"" as if ""Troop Beverly Hills"" had been mashed up with some Soviet propaganda movie. (Claire even says that Michelles design for the brownie box with a girl in a red cap raising her fist makes her think of Stalin.) See Video Ghostbusters First Trailer Proves Melissa McCarthy Kristen Wiig Aint Afraid of No Ghosts Any attempt at political commentary however is soon jettisoned in favor of more scenes that are neither here nor there neither funny nor moving as when Michelle goes to meet her former mentor Ida Marquette (Kathy Bates) for some financial backing. Bates brings gravitas to pretty much any sorry project she shows up for and her brief scene with McCarthy is the only point in ""The Boss"" where anything seems to be happening or where anything seems like it might happen but the writing for Batess character is unfocused just an afterthought leading this sequence nowhere. The wind-up of ""The Boss"" features McCarthy up against Peter Dinklage as Renault a titan of business and former lover of Michelles. There is an extended sword fight between Michelle and Renault that might seem to play into McCarthys aptitude for physical humor but this long bit doesnt even raise a light chuckle. On the heels of ""Tammy"" ""The Boss"" suggests that McCarthy really needs to regroup and find a project that she doesnt have to carry all alone and with a character that suits her sensibility better.

One hopes never to have to tell a couple ""Man thats one ugly baby"" but its hard to avoid in the case of ""The Boss"" the second big-screen love child conceived by Melissa McCarthy and her director husband Ben Falcone (after 2014s mediocre ""Tammy""). As she demonstrated with her career-high comic showcase in last years ""Spy"" McCarthy remains one of the funniest actors alive -- a truth that frequently rescues but doesnt really redeem this sloppy comedy about a ruthless self-absorbed ex-CEO trying to recover her millions with the help of her former lackey (the always appealing Kristen Bell). As expected the road to success is paved with violent pratfalls tired vulgarities and forced lump-in-the-throat moments; save for the few folks who wandered in expecting a Bruce Springsteen biopic audiences will probably lap it up. As scripted by McCarthy Falcone and actor-turned-writer Steve Mallory ""The Boss"" represents the latest of the stars mostly lucrative efforts to push back against the all-boys-club mentality of so much mainstream comedy. She has done this by filling the screen with a lively ragtag sisterhood (""Tammy""); by repurposing a traditionally male-centric genre with female leads (""The Heat"" the forthcoming ""Ghostbusters""); and by slyly subverting the usual jokes that have attached themselves to her weight and appearance as she did with her turn as an improbably gifted secret agent in Paul Feigs ""Spy."" Michelle Darnell (McCarthy) a self-made corporate empress introduced as ""the 47th wealthiest woman in America"" is nowhere near as interesting or layered a character though she certainly makes for more rewarding company than the slovenly loser-girl types the actress played in ""Tammy"" and ""Identity Thief."" A ginger-haired cross between Martha Stewart and Miranda Priestley (clad in a colorful array of suits scarves furs and turtlenecks by costume designer Wendy Chuck) Michelle apparently earned her fortune by being aggressive ruthless and extremely foul-mouthed (the actual specifics are harder to come by) and as we see in the glittery set piece that opens the movie she spends much of her time trying to instill the same greedy values in the future female leaders of tomorrow. But circumstances backfire when shes convicted of insider trading and sentenced to four months in prison then dumped back onto the streets of Chicago homeless and penniless. Coming to Michelles rescue is her former assistant Claire (Bell) who reluctantly welcomes her into the apartment she shares with her adolescent daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson). That Michelle will forge a bond with this sweet child is a given even before she starts accompanying her to meetings with the Dandelions a Girl Scout-style troupe whose multimillion-dollar cookie sales immediately get Michelles head spinning Clearly this pathetic little nonprofit doesnt even realize the gold mine its sitting on. And when it turns out that Claire makes an irresistible brownie Michelle urges her to quit her dead-end job so they can launch a baking-business venture that will make them both rich -- and in the process teach Rachel and her fellow troupe mates some valuable lessons in leadership salesmanship and (inevitably) self-defense. As demonstrated by movies as sweet as ""School of Rock"" and as nasty as ""Bad Santa"" the gradual corruption of impressionable young tots by a jaded cynical adult can be a fertile comic premise. ""The Boss"" takes up this tradition with undeniable gusto; theres a certain pleasure in watching the formidably self-assured Michelle drop F-bombs in a room full of awestruck moms and daughters or take a well-deserved swing at the Type A super-bitch Helen (Annie Mumolo) who positions herself as a rival. And McCarthy who can toss off an insult like ""Suck my d--k Gigantor"" and give it a vague impression of wit coaxes forth just about every laugh and stray chuckle that could possibly have been extracted from the material. Which is in the end a testament to McCarthys gifts as an actress -- her irrepressible flair for physical comedy and her devastating way with a one-liner -- rather than to her instincts as a writer which seem iffy at best. The ostensible comic high point of ""The Boss"" is a vicious street battle that takes place between Michelles brownie-hawking girls (called Darnells Darlings) and Helens Dandelions but its clear from the way it was shot -- in uninspired slow-motion -- that Falcone and his collaborators thought the mere idea of these girls slugging it out would be a source of endless hilarity. And maybe it is at least compared with a nonsensical set piece that finds Michelle swinging a katana sword at Renault (Peter Dinklage) her longtime nemesis and on-and-off-again paramour. Everything here -- even the stray bits that come close to working -- feels similarly arbitrary and unmotivated. Claire lands a sweet dull boyfriend (Tyler Labine) perhaps to inoculate herself and the movie against the suggestion that she and Michelle might be more than just business partners. Kathy Bates rides by on a horse. The script perhaps sensing its comic momentum is flatlining drops in multiple pointless fellatio jokes becoming even less funny in the process. McCarthy and Bell do get one amusing exchange in which a routine brassiere adjustment escalates into a lively bout of breast slapping -- a pointless moment but one of the few when ""The Boss"" actually works.

Maureen Jones says April 14 2016 at 502 pm I was disappointed to see such violence between the women in one scene that seemed to go on forever. I wish someone could make a funny movie without constant swearing and crude sexual references. I should have know Will Ferrell had a hand in this as he seems to specialise in this type of humour. Reply Karen says April 10 2016 at 439 am I used to love MM in Gilmore Girls and Mike amp; Molly (first 2 seasons only) when she was in her element. Bridesmaids was fantastic and she was great as a subtle supporting character. Unfortunately someone thought more of that part than it really was and just turned every character since into a caricature of it (sans St. Vincent which she was great in). One can only dress the overweight obnoxious buffoon with a heart of gold character in so many wigs before it just too stale to watch. Perhaps she should stop trying to be Chris Farley all the tume and go back to the not so over the top style that she shines in. Reply tome smith says April 8 2016 at 1109 am Last three McCarthy movies-- How many famp;%ing times can you say F34K in one F234ing movie? Reply Jim says April 6 2016 at 408 pm Looks terrible. Reply EricJ says April 6 2016 at 1100 am Variety Ill buy a ticket if you STOP putting that picture on the article (Although it pretty much represents the sentiment you can expect from the comedy.) Oh and does McCarthy making a ""Gigantor"" joke mean Universals planning to do a movie now like when Fox gave the line to Sandra Bullock in Speed? Reply Greg says April 6 2016 at 1015 am I love how you insulted the movie and the movie-going public at the same time. Feeling pretty high and mighty on your pedestal? Reply Ken says April 6 2016 at 927 am Maybe there is something wrong with me...but Ms. McCarthy always makes me howl...even when shes in crap. I am so looking forward to ""The Boss"" Reply Peter says April 6 2016 at 908 am Oh come on. This poc? This actress is the clone of that other no-talent dumb-down-the-audience-even-further Will Ferrell. Hollywood has given up ALL hopes of producing lasking films. Reply dmoney666 says April 6 2016 at 906 am The problem is that shes NOT a good leading lady. Tammy was abysmal (it was painful to watch so calling it ""mediocre"" is being generous) and Im sure this isnt much better. She and the studios need to accept that shes best when playing a sidekick/secondary character.

VPCMelissa McCarthy left and Kristen Bell star in The Boss.(Photo Hopper Stone)Melissa McCarthy is a take-no-prisoners brownie hustler in The Boss though the raucous comedy fails to keep up with its charismatic star.Directed by Ben Falcone (Tammy) at the helm of another vehicle for his wife The Boss ( out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday)  casts McCarthy as a female business tycoon who gets a comeuppance and winds up teaming with her former assistant (Kristen Bell) to hawk chocolate morsels and get back on top. A free-for-all of inappropriate language unsuitable for even the most crass boys-club boardroom The Boss cant quite decide if warming the heart or obliterating it with insults is the end goal.After an opening that points to her foster-kid roots McCarthys Michelle Darnell gets a fiery introduction via a Vegas-ready gold phoenix -- her totem animal -- and raps alongside T-Pain while pyro goes off. Her eternally turtlenecked mistress of business only goes more over the top from there Michelle is a decidedly untrustworthy sort with the powerful demeanor of Donald Trump and the rap sheet of Martha Stewart as Michelle is sent to a cushy slammer for five months for insider trading.USA TODAYThe Boss 5 things we learned at the films premiereShe loses pretty much everything though finds the family shes never had when Michelles former employee Claire (Bell) and her daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson) give her a home when she needs it the most. While Moms at work Michelle takes Rachel to meetings of the kids uncool Girl Scout-y Dandelions troop. Put off by the sale of mediocre cookies Michelle sees more dollar signs -- and a way back to the big time -- when she has a bite of Claires to-die-for brownies. Thus the two women start up Darnells Darlings a group of beret-clad youngsters who resemble revolutionary freedom fighters more so than your standard sash-wearing sugar peddlers.There are many moments where The Boss feels like its going for a slightly more subversive Bad News Bears vibe before it turns overly mean-spirited as four-letter words fly around kids. There is one violent girl fight with teens getting thrown into cars and cookie crumbs winding up in unseemly body crevices that is totally out of place. However its nigh impossible to stifle the chuckles spawned by Michelles knife-sharp verbal barbs the highlights of a script co-written by McCarthy and Falcone.USA TODAYMelissa McCarthy crushes Lip Sync Battle with Colors of the WindTyler Labine and Kathy Bates work nicely in a pair of smaller supporting roles as Claires love interest and Michelles model mentor respectively. Peter Dinklages talents are utilized only sparingly as Michelles antagonist ex Renault a Jersey boy who fancies himself a French samurai and is out to ruin the wily new bakers.While not as strong a performance overall as in last years excellent Spy McCarthy gives Michelle enough heart to make an otherwise despicable character quite likable. The scenes where Michelle and Rachel bond are the sweetest moments in the film -- more boss in fact than McCarthys interactions with any of her fellow adults. 58 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 9 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1RXRYCy,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/04/06/review-the-boss-movie/82657052/,200,theboss36,theboss,usatoday

With Melissa McCarthy Kristen Bell Peter Dinklage. R for sexual content language and brief drug use (139) Director Ben Falcone. ""The Boss"" doesnt work. Melissa McCarthy stars in this half-baked and derivative comedy. The ""Bridesmaids"" Oscar nominee can blame herself for the material -- she helped write it -- which may help explain why shes in virtually every scene. At least that spares the rest of the cast from more embarrassing exposure. That includes Kathy Bates and Peter Dinklage slumming as creepy cutthroat titans. Its a rags-to-riches-to-jailhouse tale. Following a miserable childhood in numerous foster homes Michelle Darnelle (McCarthy) trusts no one loves no one. Shes single-handedly pushed her way to the top. Kristen Bell (center l.) and Melissa McCarthy provide a bad role model for their younger charges in ""The Boss"" (Photo Credit Hopper Stone/Hopper Stone) But karmas a bitch. Shes ratted out for insider trading. Michelle leaves the slammer with nothing no one and nowhere to go. Ex-assistant Claire (Kristen Bell) a single mom to tween-aged Rachel (Ella Anderson) reluctantly takes her in. Quicker than you can say ""Troop Beverly Hills"" Michelle decides the secret to success is in Claires brownies and Rachels scout troop. McCarthy and Bell get more of a laugh than audiences will in a scene from the movie. (Photo Credit Hopper Stone) If they gave out badges for smutty language this movie would have lots. Theres nothing wrong with that. But filthy doesnt automatically equal funny. McCarthy and co-writers Ben Falcone her husband and Steve Mallory never met a joke they wouldnt recycle and drive into the ground. One about oral sex gets a wearying workout. Theres another one in which Michelle and Claire check out each others boobs. Just hilarious. What stands out most about the film is its mean spirit. To outdo a rival Michelle blackmails and bullies. Or she just tells girls that theyre ugly. Sound familiar? Yep its comedy custom-made for the age of Trump but without a shred of irony suggesting it gets that. In the category of movies to avoid ""The Boss"" gets my vote.

The actress specializes in characters with indestructible bravado no matter where they stand on the socioeconomic ladder; Michelle the ""47th wealthiest woman in the world"" joins the swaggering sorority formed by Megan in Bridesmaids (2011) Mullins in The Heat (2013) and even Tammy in uh Tammy (2014). That last film a muddle of half-thought-out ideas was ineptly directed by Ben Falcone McCarthys husband. That the spouses re-teamed for The Boss made me worry that go-it-alone Michelles definition of family -- ""an anchor that will make you sink"" -- would prove all too accurate. The Boss is a better film than Tammy but it still flounders almost capsizing in its sloppy final third.Yet The Bosss opening moments showcase McCarthys brilliance at basking in excess. And wearing it Outfitted in turtlenecks that stretch to the chin and bows the size of spinnakers her ensembles suggesting what might result if Wendy and Lisa developed their own line at Eileen Fisher Michelle is a paragon of tailored too-much-ness.After a prologue shows the future magnate being repeatedly returned to a Catholic orphanage by cowed foster families rejections that forge her steely resolve the adult tycoon makes her entrance to the stage of a Chicago arena packed with frenzied acolytes on the back of an ablaze phoenix (""my totem animal""). In her seminar -- part TED Talk part Ozzfest part Hot 97 Summer Jam -- Michelle lets the screaming hordes know that no indulgence no matter how byzantine or bizarre is out of her price range ""I had Destinys Child reunite and come to my personal living room just so I could watch them break up again.""Thats just one of many hilarious scenarios we are left to imagine -- another is Michelle telling an enemy that his sainted dead wife is ""fuckin IT guys in hell"" -- and McCarthys delivery and timing are as ever flawless. ""My tongue has always been my sword"" Michelle boasts words that also apply to the woman who plays her. McCarthy created the bumptious mogul roughly fifteen years ago while a member of the Los Angeles improv troupe the Groundlings; as she did with Tammy the actress co-wrote the script of The Boss with Falcone. (Steve Mallory who met both McCarthy and Falcone as a fellow Groundling also has a screenplay credit.) McCarthys long history with the character likely accounts for the fact that The Boss at least initially has a tighter plot than Tammy and is less reliant on dumb throwaway gags.But like the earlier movie The Boss gives its star few if any hitting partners. Its a baffling decision considering that McCarthy is not only a terrific ensemble performer as her breakthrough turn in Bridesmaids demonstrated but also a generous lead when working with a scene-stealing supporting cast evidenced in last years riotous Spy. McCarthys castmates this time out include Kristen Bell playing Claire the onetime assistant Michelle turns to after serving a four-month jail sentence for insider trading. The disgraced one-percenter moves in to the Chicago walk-up where her ex-employee a single mom is raising her tween daughter Rachel (Ella Anderson).Claire proves a dull foil She may upbraid her former overseer but her chastisement is always softened by Bells inveterate sunny blandness. (I wish Bells part had gone to Cecily Strong the SNL star who here plays Claires supervisor at a miserable office job; as is the case with her bit role in The Bronze a patchy comedy released a few weeks back Strongs talents are completely underutilized in The Boss.)McCarthy must also share the screen with Peter Dinklage an actor with no demonstrable gift for comedy who plays Michelles vengeful ex-lover Renault. Complications arising from the scorned swains payback scheme plus Michelles invariable redemptive quest to be incorporated into the nuclear unit of Claire and her daughter set off the disastrous last act. These closing scenes include a wearying caper to retrieve documents from Renaults office a plot thread that too prominently features the acharismatic Tyler Labine (as Claires boyfriend) and feeble dick-sucking jokes. Better are the lesbo jabs that Michelle makes during Rachels scout-group meeting (here called the Dandelions) -- a gathering that provides McCarthy with two equals the indignant matron played by Annie Mumolo (who co-wrote Bridesmaids with Kristen Wiig) and in her screen debut Eva Peterson as Chrystal a terrifying classmate of Rachels who becomes Michelles top lieutenant in her Dandelion takeover.The rapport between the veteran comic genius and the neophyte even in the few scenes they share suggests that McCarthy may next want to buddy up not with a peer (like Sandra Bullock in The Heat) or with someone a generation older (Susan Sarandon in Tammy) but with a kid at least thirty years her junior.The Boss Directed by Ben Falcone Universal Pictures Opens April 8 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Melissa Anderson Follow MelissEAnderson Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.
