What about the world story shortage? Its clearly acute or else why did Brandon Camp (who also directs) and Mike Thompson decide to write a romcom about bereavement? Killing off the wife is one way to ensure your hero is available but Love Happens is more concerned with the shit that happens than in love of any kind.Burke (Aaron Eckhart) a psychologist whose wife died in a car crash wrote a self-help manual to get through it; three years on hes a bereavement guru back in Seattle to lead a pack of heartsore conventioneers back to health via group therapy and er walking on hot coals. Nobody in the film finds the latter weird not even Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) a cute florist who is increasingly interested in Burke despite his almost total inability to interact. Aniston is endearingly natural but she and Eckhart lack chemistry and anyway the filmmakers are far more interested in the mourners than the would-be lovers. Even Burkes pushy but genuine agent Lane (Dan Fogler) gets more face time than our Jen and the waste of Martin Sheen as Burkes father-in-law is at least as cruel as any of the twists that deprived these folk of their relatives.The script feels as if a bad writer had sat on a better one Men are... hairy Eloises friend says knowingly shortly before we all plod off for redemption at Home Depot. The sorrowing widower is a great subject for film romance; but the point is to let the girl have a proper crack at cheering him up. And as always with love a GSOH would help.

His false life earns him a cutting rebuke from his ex-father in law - ""Youre a hippocrite"" he yells into Burkes face. You get to see lots of rain in this movie - it is based in Seattle after all and air-shots of the 60s and ugly Space Needle feature a fair amount. The film has strength in being a lot better than many of the pre-Xmas dross currently clogging our cinemas and the parrot scenes are fun.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/87730/love-happens.html,200,lovehappens0,lovehappens,timeout

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet What happens when Manic Pixie Dream Girls grow up? Judging from the romantic drama Love Happens they apparently get a little more mature (or maybe a little more medicated) but they still cant stop being fizzy quirk-pots who live to brighten up the lives of mopey sensitive men. Jennifer Aniston doesnt entirely fit the MPDG mold in Love Happens--she does have small fragments of her own life including a seemingly successful florist shop and a briefly seen ex-boyfriend who made her chary about living and loving again--but her brisk flightiness and her habit of cheering up potential partner Aaron Eckhart via precious little quests and wacky adventures does play tediously into the all-too-familiar Manic Pixie mode. But thats far from the only familiar thing about Love Happens an occasionally poignant but far too dutiful rom-com-dram where half the shots and sequences come from a familiar playbook. Eckhart is thoroughly sincere and charming as a self-help guru whos made a profitable career out of hiding his agonized guilt over his wifes death so well that other victims of life flock to hear his words of wisdom. Hes a salesman a slick fast-talker peddling the emotional salvation he cant offer himself. After he spots Aniston and they run through the well-worn ""first they hate each other then they love each other"" routine they briefly connect but once she gets close enough to see through the chinks in his armor he has to finally deal with everything hes hiding under there. First-time director Brandon Camp and his co-scripter (and John Doe creator-writer-producer partner) Mike Thompson play it safe by sticking to the Film 101 playbook Theres the contractual establishing shot zooming into Seattle from across the water the obligatory scene of Eckhart tearfully watching old videos of his wife a by-the-numbers ""exploring offbeat Seattle"" montage a little necessary tone-setting banter between Aniston and her employee Judy Greer and a bunch of hugging and weeping once the floodgates open. The film contains almost no rough edges; thanks to decades of previous use just about every shot and sequence is as polished as a riverbed stone. Which makes the film go down easy enough for those who bother--which is to say either those who havent seen enough films to anticipate every moment of this one from the trailer or those for whom such films are deliciously bland comfort food.

"Love Happens | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; love-happens ) Love Happens (United States 2009) September 19 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Is this a movie or a feature-length advertisement for Qwest? Were not just talking one product placement; this brand name is nearly omnipresent. The title Love Happens is a play on the common phrase ""shit happens."" However while the ""shit"" may have been removed from the title it pollutes the screen. This is a maudlin romantic dramedy whose every frame reeks of artificiality. While that characteristic is kept somewhat in check during the films first hour it spirals out of control during the final third rendering the climax and conclusion nearly unwatchable. On the way to the expected happy ending Love Happens uses clichA(c)s and improbable occurrences to resolve everything so simply and cleanly that it threatens to trigger the gag reflex. Love Happens is being inaccurately marketed as a ""romantic comedy"" when in fact its light on the laughs. In fact the narrative comes closer to a Lifetime weeper than a sitcom. There are some awkward attempts at comedy many of which fail. For the most part however first time director Brandon Camp is content to keep things on the serious side. That would be okay of course if his take on the subject wasnt so facile as to border on insulting. Movies that address material of this nature should have the courage to do so in an honest fashion. Burke Ryan (Aaron Eckhart) is the author of the bestselling A-Okay a self-help manual for those who have lost loved ones. Burke wrote the book in response to his wifes death which happened three years ago but his life is a template for not practicing what he preaches. When he arrives in Seattle where he and his wife used to live to facilitate one of his popular seminars he finds himself confronting the past in the person of his father-in-law (Martin Sheen). Meanwhile he meets Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) a local florist who catches his interest. After a rocky first couple of encounters they go out on a date-thats-not-really-a-date. But Burkes inability to effectively process his wifes death threatens everything - his potential relationship with Eloise his lucrative seminars and a potential TV/DVD deal being worked out by his agent Lane (Dan Fogler). Had Camp shown the gumption to address Burkes issues in a believable fashion Love Happens might have been less galling. However because the filmmakers desire is to make the movie as accessible as possible everything has been reduced to sugar-coated bite-sized pieces that will go down easily. Burke achieves his catharsis by means that would only work in a motion picture. All he needs apparently is the love of a good woman the helping hand of a friend and an arena in which he can confess his shortcomings. In this movie world thats all thats necessary to overcome three years of hypocrisy and buried grief. The movie is equally insulting in the way it addresses the pain of loss and guilt suffered by Walter (John Carroll Lynch) who isnt coping well with the death of his son. The performances are fine. Eckhart brings as much humanity to Burke as the artifice-laden script will allow. He never feels like a real person but thats more an issue of the way the character is written than the way he is played. Jennifer Anistons involvement like the entire romance feels shoehorned into the production. Shes one of several catalysts for Burkes transformation but the movie might have proceeded in pretty much the same way without her. To his credit at least Camp doesnt force something hot-and-heavy down our throats. Although Burke and Eloise develop a connection theres no horizontal action. The best performance belongs to John Carroll Lynch in a supporting role. We actually feel for this guy - Lynch makes Walters grief palpable. Judy Greer (as Eloises best friend) and Martin Sheen are underused. Love Happens makes the mistake of trying to soften what should be a frank difficult movie by grafting on an unearned feel-good ending. Films of this sort work when we feel like weve traveled with the protagonist on a path of healing; in this case steps have been skipped and the whole thing is a cheat. Those searching for another Jennifer Aniston rom-com will likely be unsatisfied; the romance is tepid and underdeveloped. Theres little to like about Love Happens and quite a few reasons to stay away.

Add to ... Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Sep. 17 2009 443PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Love Happens Directed by Brandon Camp Written by Brandon Camp and Mike Thompson Starring Aaron Eckhart Jennifer Aniston Dan Fogler Judy Greer Frances Conroy and Martin Sheen Classification PG In her new film Jennifer Aniston plays a scarf-wearing florist named Eloise who falls for a widower with enough baggage to fill a DC-8. Eloise? Woolly scarves? Shady widowers? Its hard to believe but the green-eyed sprite we knew as Rachel Green our TV best Friend from 1994-2004 is settling into spinsterhood. Aaron Eckhart is the dubious catch here a Dr. Phil type with a lucrative product line - books CDs vitamins - labelled ""A-Okay"" The only problem is that the self-help guru is a helpless liar. Handsome Burke Ryan PhD the expert who teaches everyone how to deal with tragedy never even went to his own wifes funeral. A duplicitous doc would seem to be meant for Aniston an actress whose well-publicized personal life is spelled out in her movie titles - The Good GirlThe Break Up  Rumor Has It  Derailed . In Love Happens  Eloises best friend Marty (Judy Greer) might be referring to Anistons past in telling her ""You tend to fall for the guys with expiration dates on their foreheads."" Of course romantic comedies like middle-aged love are blind to character flaws and expiration dates. Sure enough Eloise and Dr. Burke meet cutely - physically bumping into each other in a hotel corridor. He helps her pick up her things. Soon theyre drinking coffee and drinking in each others eyes. Love happens for them sure; its in the script. But how about us? Do we fall in love with Eloise and Burke? The answer as you may have guessed is her yes; him ainnh. Aniston has the screen empathy gene. Her film characters are game for life and laugh easily especially at themselves. But it is the sadness that lingers in her eyes that touches us. Everyone screenwriters included are interested in her. The writer-director of Love Happens  Brandon Camp provides Aniston with intriguing quirks. Eloise is the kind of florist who finds folk poetry in messages that come with flowers. She collects well-struck sentiments. She also scrawls silly provocations behind paintings in hotel corridors - flirtatious invitations to some unknown adventurer who might strive to find her. That turns out to be Dr. Burke. Eckhart has top billing and most of the screen time and there are plenty of scenes intended to suggest hes a swell sensitive guy with problems. Nevertheless we get the nagging sense that Eckhart hasnt really evolved to use a Dr. Burke word from the self-absorbed schmuck he was in Thank You for Smoking  where he played a conscience-free tobacco lobbyist. Oh filmmaker Camp has added a dash of meat tenderizer; Eckhart smiles more and works hard at listening. Still there he is giving his self-help workshop group - men and women who have lost loved ones - 2 truth candles to help illuminate their problems. Eckharts con-man was a lot of fun in Thank You for Smoking . But we were always in on the swindle. Here were being asked to cheer for a guy we suspect is trouble. We feel like were being conned too. Another problem with Love Happens is the company that Eloise and Dr. Burke keep. Just as we measure Bond movies by their villains we judge romantic comedies by the supporting cast. (Think of the flavourful eccentrics who littered Hepburn and Tracy comedies.) Burkes curly-topped agent (Dan Fogler) and Eloises poetry-slamming friend (Greer) dont have much to do except follow their friends around and fret. The lone belly laugh from the minor players is supplied by a parrot named Rocky that can impersonate a fire alarm while doing the Lindy Hop. Anistons constituency will enjoy seeing her again in Love Happens . Shes lovely and fun to be with as always. But him? They probably think her new fella is iffy. Theyd be right. Hang in there Jen.

In Love Happens Aaron Eckhart mimes the moods of a sad slick motivational speaker with a specialty in grief counseling -- a skill he developed after the death of his wife. Jennifer Aniston impersonates a perky plucky singleton florist with a specialty in tilting her head inquisitively. The two mope and chirp around Seattle until finally finally the moper releases a parrot into the wild (dont ask) and kisses the chirper. Other stuff happens too all of it strained and dull with the exception of those scenes in which MVP character actor John Carroll Lynch steals the show as a grieving father.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Kimberley French) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / September 18 2009 E-mail this article To Invalid E-mail address Add a personal message Your E-mail Invalid E-mail address Sending your article Your article has been sent. E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Love Happens is being sold as a romantic comedy but its really a Big Cry movie. You know the genre main characters whove suffered tragedy and lost touch with their emotions who get redeemed by love and a few well-orchestrated crises who lead the audience in a big cathartic bawl at the end. Its a tricky balancing act Beg for sympathy too early and youve got corn chowder; pour on the tears too heavily at the end and it all comes apart like a wet Kleenex.Brandon Camps movie doesnt make the first mistake but trips badly over the second. It helps that he has two likable stars Aaron Eckhart as a psychiatrist who has turned his grief over his wifes death into a self-help cottage industry and Jennifer Aniston as a free spirit who runs a flower store.They meet cute - Burke smacks into Eloise in the hallway of a Seattle hotel where hes giving a seminar - and court cuter but Eckhart gives his lines an edgy topspin and Aniston is well within her narrow comfort zone.On hand as the required ""wacky best friends are Dan Fogler (playing Burkes agent) and Judy Greer (as Eloises assistant). Its formula but sometimes the formula works. For about half its running time ""Love Happens looks like the kind of date-night headcheese you can live with.Theres trouble a-brewing though not least Martin Sheen in the role of Burkes father-in-law glowering on the horizon like an uneasy conscience. As Burkes ""A-OK seminar progresses through a long weekend (and as the agent pursues a mega-deal that could turn his client into the next Dr. Phil) ""Love Happens turns its attention to all the emotional gunk the hero is repressing even as hes coaching others to let it all hang out. The movies so blunt in its greeting-card symbolism that Burke even has to rescue his wifes pet bird and let it fly free.That scenes pretty funny admittedly but its the last gasp of lightness before Camp and co-writer Mike Thompson open the floodgates and turn ""Love Happens into glycerine therapy. Not that the grieving process shouldnt be addressed in a movie but this one feels increasingly cooked up. Burkes built-in illogic - hes a sensitive soul building a business on his wifes death? - becomes hard for even the actor playing him to ignore and in the final scenes Eckhart throws in the towel and shamelessly pimps for our tears and approval.By then the movie has become one of those sticky dramas that use working-class stiffs (John Carroll Lynch as a grieving construction worker) and hipster bohemians to lend the white-bread main characters a soul and credibility they lack on their own. Eloise has just about vanished by this point but the movie trots her out one last time so Burke can turn up at her store for an apology scene boiled down from the last five Hugh Grant movies. ""Love Happens? So do other things but I cant say what they are in a family paper.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

LOVE Happens"" is a weepie about the grieving process mainly my own. Two hours of my life have been brutally stolen from me and I need closure. So here goes. Aaron Eckhart plays one of those sleazy cliche-spouting mountebanks who inexplicably fill hotel ballrooms with applauding morons eager to hear room-temperature cliches. Except here hes a hero. His big topic is coping with the loss of a loved one. My notebook only has about 50 pages so I ran out of room but among the pellets of wisdom this movie presents are the following When life gives you lemons make lemonade. (No Im serious.) Happiness is a state of mind. When one thing ends something else begins. PHOTOS JEN ANISTON AND HER LEADING MEN Burke (Eckhart) meets a florist (Jennifer Aniston) literally by bumping into her in the hallway of his hotel. After initially blowing him off (she pretends to be mute) she gets flowers and an invitation to dinner from him and suddenly shes all purring and smiles. They wave their pretty hair at each other. Cute movie stuff happens. She rents a cherry picker to take him to see a rock concert because standing in a cold metal bucket 30 feet above the ground for two hours has got to be fun. She leaves odd words (like ""quidnunc"") scribbled on a wall for no discernible reason. At Burkes seminar which lasts an entire week or almost as long as this movie people hold a ""candle of truth"" and let spill with the intimacies. Says a woman of her dead fella ""I made a mold of his um . . . you know. That way when he was gone we could still . . . you know."" Thanks I didnt need to know. People walk over coals and Burke heals a former contractor who lost his son with a Home Depot shopping spree. Burke is tight-lipped about the details of his wifes death in a car accident setting up a third-act reveal that isnt surprising (the only reason you wont have guessed it in advance is if you think its too obvious) and doesnt change anything important. Writer-director Brandon Camp wouldnt be able to get a job writing parking tickets if he hadnt been born into the movie business. His father Joe Camp created the profitable ""Benji"" dog movies in the 1970s. Even his title is unfortunate carrying a reminder of a popular bumper-sticker phrase that also ends with ""happens"" but begins with a different four-letter word. Come to think of it that would have made a far more accurate label for this film. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Dirty Dancing town plans Swayze memorial Read Next Dirty Dancing town plans Swayze memorial Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 33242 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 24408 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 18443 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

This time she plays Eloise a Seattle florist who drives a quirky van and wears cunning hats. As per usual Aniston has bountiful hair and a fretful mouth and is available for love. The object of her tepid affection is Burke (Aaron Eckhart) the best-selling author of a self-help book called A-Okay. Burke has specialized in trying to cajole others out of grief since his wife died in a car accident three years before but he is living a lie because he is not A-O.K. But enough about them. We know theyre going to get together despite the heat between them topping out at about 56deg (Fahrenheit sadly) but we never get vested in the romance. Eckharts best moments are the ones in which we see Burke psyching himself up to glad-hand his fans. But problematically even after weve seen the ""real"" Burke the snake-oil salesman with the sharky grin is more convincing. So its far more satisfying to focus on the supporting actors the people who try their hardest to make this cutely maudlin movie bearable. Martin Sheen has only four short scenes -- two of them seconds long and conducted opposite a fluffy white parrot (who had me at ""Hello"") -- yet still leaves a vivid impression. He plays Burkes former father-in-law Silver a retired Marine who is handling his grief in the most productive way possible by showing up at the Seattle hotel where one of Burkes multiday seminars for the bereft is under way to remind him that a) he Silver is not A-O.K. b) he thinks Burke shouldnt be either and finally c) just because Martin Sheen reveals his teeth doesnt mean hes smiling at you. After this scene I sat up jotted down ""thrown for a loop"" in my notebook and commenced hoping hed come back. During that long wait I focused on the woefully underappreciated actor John Carroll Lynch. You might remember him from Fargo in which he played Marge Gundersons husband Norm or Things We Lost in the Fire in which he gave a compellingly tender and pleasingly peculiar performance as Halle Berrys neighbor. Love Happens is not his best work -- that would probably be his chilling performance in Zodiac as the prime suspect Arthur Leigh Allen -- but its still pretty fine. Lynch has been working steadily since 1993 which was right about the time of Eckharts first screen credit but he unlike Eckhart never become a star. (There may be an issue involving a lack of hair. On his head.) Here Lynch plays Walter a contractor from Billings who drove all the way to Seattle for Burkes hokey seminar and a few hours in sensibly wants his money back. Burke has to practice some serious self-help voodoo to keep skeptical Walter on the hook but eventually (its an interminable seminar) he gets Walter to pull a photo of his 12-year-old son out of his wallet and recount the story of his death. At which point I wrote ""almost cried"" in my notebook. No mainstream movie about coping with grief would be complete without some comic relief or at least thats what the studio presumably told the screenwriters Mike Thompson and Brandon Camp who also directed. To that end we have Judy Greer and Dan Fogler. Greer has made a career of playing the wry best friend (27 Dresses 13 Going on 30 The Wedding Planner). She plays Marty a poetess flower arranger and dispenser of advice to Eloise and as usual shes cute funny and charming enough to be able to recite a poem featuring a phallus without making you hate her. Fogler plays Burkes manager Lane. Lane is plump sweaty and initially seems so eager to cash in on Burkes burgeoning celebrity that we assume were watching a young Ari Gold (without Aris personal trainer). But Fogler who had a gleeful part as the head of a absurd theater troupe in Ang Lees Taking Woodstock conveys a genuine concern for Burke and we grow fond of him as well. Love never happens in this movie but at least theres some liking here and there. See TIMEs fall entertainment preview. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week.

Love Happens Cupid misses by a mile | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLove Happens Cupid misses by a mileGood grief The title alone of Love Happens should be warning enough that this romantic-comedy is the kind of cloying saccharine-saturated date movie that only the most deluded of fools in love would enjoy.Spoiler alert Burke played by Aaron Eckhart and Jennifer Anistons Eloise live happily ever after.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. Sept. 18 2009(out of 4)Starring Aaron Eckart Jennifer Aniston. Directed by Brandon Camp. 109 minutes. At major theatres. PG Good griefThe title alone of Love Happens should be warning enough that this romantic-comedy is the kind of cloying saccharine-saturated date movie that only the most deluded of fools in love would enjoy.Worse still the title doesnt actually convey much of the actual plot which is about a man still in mourning (and denial) three years after his wifes death who nonetheless makes a lucrative living as a self-help guru counselling others on how to cope with the loss of loved ones.Article Continued BelowWhile doing a week-long seminar in Seattle - the city where IT (the car accident) happened Burke Ryan (played by Aaron Eckhart) encounters Eloise a kooky florist (played by Jennifer Aniston) whose first instinct is to brush him off by pretending to be deaf.Would that she had been successful the audience would have been spared close to two hours of plodding painfully predictable pseudo-drama interspersed with occasional dollops of comedy lite.Predictability works in inverse relation to suspense so the questions raised - Will Burke finally deal with his own grief and reconcile with his in-laws? Will Dan the contractor grieving the death of his son finally learn to accept it after a shopping spree at Home Depot? Will Burke and Eloise finally realize they may be right for each other? - are each a resoundingly foreseeable yes yes and yes.Eckhart with the best cleft chin in Hollywood since Kirk Douglas gets by far the most screen time and hes a likeable sort. But its hard to respect a character which as the author of A-Okay a guide to grief relief spouts such tripe that he makes Dr. Phil sound like Aristotle. Despite the fact that its sleetless in Seattle Aniston overdresses for all her exterior scenes in a succession of designer wool hats and loopy scarves. Indoors her blond highlights shimmers along with the kind of wardrobe youd see on a college-age kid with rich parents.Her baby blues express a sort of vaguely puzzled enigmatic quality throughout (possibly because she keeps forgetting her motivation).Supporting players - his agent her co-worker - just arent funny enough to steal a scene and Martin Sheen who plays the ex-Marine father-in-law whos actually just a big teddy bear inside is actually kind of creepy.Seattle tourist officials must be thrilled by the citys starring role throughout featuring identifiable local landmarks and amenities such as the Space Needle slam poetry grunge rock and coffee houses equipped with hookahs which burn only non-offending substances.Too cynical you might say? Not one-tenth as cynical as the studio execs who gave this vacuous rom-com the green-light knowing it would score at the box office.Love happens? Yeah well so does boredom and bad filmmaking.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Instead it trades in the slogans of self-help procedural.The film unfolds during a weekend seminar in Seattle where Burke Ryan (Aaron Eckhart) mental-health guru belatedly swallows advice he dispenses to others.Burke is one of those publicly charismatic privately brooding fellows who preaches what he cannot practice. Though he counsels others to accept that there is life after a loved ones death Burke is in prolonged mourning for his late wife.For three years he hasnt even looked at another woman - until he spies Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) the long-stemmed florist whose colorful arrangements adorn the hotel where hes booked. Suddenly Burke is intrigued.Eloise is not. Until she is. Until shes not again. Until Burke can be honest with himself - and her.This is surely the first movie in which the metaphor for the heros return to mental health is (literally) setting free his caged cockatoo. Burke knows why the caged bird squawks.Brandon Camps film has a ping-pongy rhythm and spin suitable for romantic comedy but rather lighthearted for the emotional load it drops.Despite its two appealing leads Love Happens is as the kids say not happening.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

(Universal Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday September 17 2009 230 PM Title Love Happens You know what? If filmmakers cant be bothered to care about their movies theres no reason we should either. A date movie doesnt have to be art but it ought to be artfully made with at least some sense of respect for the audience and actors.Some may wonder why Jennifer Aniston keeps taking projects about single women unlucky in love. But the bigger question in ""Love Happens"" is why with her pick of scripts she chose one so utterly uninspired. Even she seems bored by her character Seattle florist Eloise Chandler. (The last name ""Ross"" presumably was deemed too obvious.) Aaron Eckhart is the soapoperatically named Dr. Burke Ryan an emotionally stunted self-help guru. Ryans wife died three years ago and now he travels the country counseling large groups of mourners for a few days at a time.After one of his seminars he and Eloise bump into each other -- literally since creativity is not a priority here -- and begin a boring romance in which she urges him to take some of his own advice.And thats pretty much it scenes of people grappling with devastating loss are intercut with various dates in which two stars with no chemistry try vainly to find something of interest to grab on to. We never feel the love -- except for Seattle which is beautifully shot -- and next to nothing happens.Eckhart has an easier time as the conflicted guru than as the bland boyfriend while Aniston looks understandably annoyed to be stuck playing a standard character defined by only-in-the-movies eccentricities. (Eloise occasionally scribbles wacky words like ""quidnunc"" on public walls for people to find.) The supporting actors dont fare much better. John Carroll Lynch offers a heartfelt turn as a bereft father but Dan Fogler is miscast as Burkes slick agent and Judy Greer simply recycles her quirky-sidekick shtick.Worst of all though is the cheap and frankly manipulative way director/co-writer Brandon Camp uses grief as a plot point. For 12 -- and two hours of our time -- we deserve more than a movie as shallow and generic as its title.

Excise the love story and theres a pretty good movie buried within ""Love Happens"" struggling to get out mostly to little avail. Aaron Eckhart shares top billing with Jennifer Aniston but hers is clearly a supporting role leaving Eckhart and a fine performance by John Carroll Lynch to provide the sporadic highlights. Alas Lynch isnt on the billboards and those drawn anticipating romance will have to grapple with sluggish pacing and an uneven tone. So while Universal would doubtless welcome a sunnier box office forecast for this Seattle-set comedy hey stuff happens. At times resembling his character in ""Thank You for Smoking"" Eckhart stars as Burke who has channeled grief over losing his wife in a fatal car accident into a motivational bestseller ""A-Okay"" and a series of self-help seminars for survivors. On the verge of inking a deal brokered by his diligent agent (Dan Fogler) that will potentially turn him into the next Dr. Phil Burke returns to Seattle -- where his wifes buried -- to host one of these events. There he literally bumps into a flower-shop owner named Eloise (Aniston) setting in motion a relationship filled with unconvincingly twinkly moments. If only Burkes interplay with Eloise came close to his work with Walter (Lynch) -- a skeptical father who grudgingly attends the workshop devastated by the loss of his son. Yet the not-too-subtle message in the screenplay that director Brandon Camp co-wrote with producer Mike Thompson (the two previously collaborated on the supernatural romance ""Dragonfly"" and TVs ""John Doe"") is that Burke talks a better game than he plays -- counseling the bereaved to shun the numbing help of alcohol say while conspicuously swilling Grey Goose vodka (one of several distractingly overt product plugs in the film). Eckhart again demonstrates his willingness to undertake a variety of roles and hes compelling enough to hold your attention -- especially in scenes with Lynch or too-brief exchanges with Martin Sheen as his estranged father-in-law. Yet almost more to service the marketing campaign than the story the narrative keeps returning to Eloise. Some of the casting (""Six Feet Unders"" Frances Conroy for example appears in blink-and-miss-her fashion as Eloises mother) hints at trims that might have occurred and the movie still drags en route to its well-telegraphed climax. The most ill-served party however is Aniston whose character never really comes into focus seeming to exist only to advance our sympathy toward Burke. At various points shes winsome (scribbling obscure words in hidden places) yet standoffish; prone to bad personal decisionmaking yet free-spirited; and finally conveniently determined to lead Burke out of his funk. Pic makes reasonably good use of its Seattle locales (while also lensing in Canada) but would have been more interesting by more fully embracing the sense of gloom that the towns frequent downpour invites. For all that ""Love Happens"" isnt necessarily bad but rather like the hyperbolic title of Burkes book It should lose the ""A-"" since its merely okay.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint LOVE HAPPENS  out of four stars Rating PG-13 for language sexual references Burke (Aaron Eckhart) is a widowed psychologist whose bestseller about dealing with loss has made him a celebrity bereavement guru. While running a seminar in Seattle he meets Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) a florist who stirs his emotions for the first time since his wifes death. To complain that ""Love Happens"" is a routine Hollywood romance is like protesting that Nilla Wafers have a cookie-cutter similarity. Eckhart has the meatier role as a half-healed trauma coach whos morose offstage but infomercial-excited in the spotlight. Eckhart is good at suggesting dark moody notes beneath a charming veneer; more of those touches would have made Burke compelling. Anistons performance is surprisingly guarded. Their chemistry hovers around the ""good friends"" level with little romantic ardor. ""Love Happens"" is technically slick with gorgeous Seattle locations handsomely photographed. The problem comes in the telling. Was it really necessary to stop the movie halfway through for a featurette-length Home Depot commercial? The dramatic hook of the story involves a secret that any viewer can see a mile off. The film is a harmless time-waster that could have been more. COLIN COVERT THE BEACHES OF AGNEs  out of four stars Rating Not rated; brief nudity. Subtitled. Where Edina. To see this film is to fall in love with its creator and subject 81-year-old auteur Agnes Varda ""a little old lady pleasantly plump and talkative"" in her own modest description. Varda was present at the birth of the French New Wave and still makes films with more brio and imagination than most professionals a third her age. ""Beaches"" is a chipper colorful film essay about her life her career and friendships with the bad boys of French filmmaking including her late husband ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" director Jacques Demy. Varda made fiery feminist films in the 70s but was too independent-minded to be confined to the womens-film ghetto. She opens her heart to one and all from the bakers who are her next-door neighbors in France to her unlikely Hollywood pal Zalman King soft-core sovereign of the ""Red Shoe Diaries."" Her autobiography overflows with passages of Fellini-esque beauty as she films a trapeze troupe against the sea as well as skits of surreal silliness. When was the last time you saw a world-renowned director converse with a cartoon cat or dress as a potato? COLIN COVERT Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs  out of four stars Rating PG; mild language This computer-animated 3D extravaganza is the ultimate food fight capitalizing on the universal compulsion to play with your food. But like any good food fight it offers short-lived entertainment. Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) is a brilliant but misguided inventor who has the best intentions but the worst ideas. When the town of Chewandswallow falls on tough times he is committed to liberating everyone from their daily diet of sardines. A harebrained machine that converts water into any food goes haywire destroys half the town and launches into the sky. Its deemed yet another Flint Lockwood failure until -- whadda ya know -- it starts raining cheeseburgers The town is smitten and Flint is a hero. Gluttony and thoughtlessness prevail as Flint preoccupied by his newfound fame and beautiful weathergirl Sam unwittingly unleashes a worldwide food tempest. Based on the much loved (and gentler) book by Judi and Ron Barrett ""Cloudy"" takes the premise and goes as out of control as Flints food machine. A self-proclaimed ""film made by a lot of people"" it relies too heavily on CGI and quick laughs to give much more than momentary enjoyment. KATHIE SMITH THEATER OF WAR  out of four stars Rating Not rated. Where Oak Street Cinema. In 2006 New Yorks Delacorte Theater staged a fantastic theatrical event Bertolt Brechts masterpiece ""Mother Courage"" starring Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline. Streep played the cunning mercenary survivialist trudging through the Thirty Years War switching alliances and carving out deals but ultimately unable to outwit inevitable fate. This behind-the-scenes account of the production preserves the actors artful intense performances and offers their insights into the social responsibility of artists in turbulent times. A strong spirit of protest against the Iraq war motivated the production. As producer Oskar Eustis observes ""Its a play that examines the question of what are the things that attract us to that which destroys us because all of us are acceding to what is being done in our name by our country."" COLIN COVERT BURMA VJ  out of four stars Rating Not rated; subtitled. Where Oak Street Cinema. Journalism might be endangered in the United States but it can get one killed in Burma where for decades the junta has cracked down violently on protesters and those who dare to cover them. This unique and startling documentary collects understandably shaky footage from the Democratic Voice of Burma whose members risked their lives to capture harrowing images of the 2007 uprising of democracy-seeking Buddhist monks and their followers in Rangoon. ""Burma VJ"" would be even more intense without its early announcement that some scenes have been restaged putting the viewer in a regrettably uncertain relationship to what follows.

ABOUT THE MOVIELove Happens  (out of four) Stars Jennifer Aniston Aaron Eckhart Dan Fogler John Carroll Lynch Martin Sheen Judy GreerDirector Brandon CampDistributor Universal PicturesRating PG-13 for some language including sexual references.Running time 1 hour 48 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Love Happens is an oddly upbeat title for a movie that is surprisingly sad. The ads would have you think this is a warm and fuzzy romantic comedy but the plot focuses on facing death and loss. Sure flowers a surprise concert and a couple romantic gestures are in the mix. But theres a downbeat tone to the story about charismatic self-help guru and best-selling author Burke Ryan (Aaron Eckhart) who helps grieving people get on with their lives but is unable to take his own advice. On the brink of a multimedia deal that could bring Dr. Phil-like stardom Burke conducts a three-day seminar. During those few days -- which play out like weeks -- he finds himself attracted to Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) a florist he meets at his hotel. Their initial connection is a bust and on their second brush they get into a tiff. Somehow they muster the courage to go on a date. While both Eckhart and Aniston are appealing their interactions are not exactly light-hearted. The film has its breezy moments but it traffics in weightier emotional stuff than mere flirtation. Those expecting an escapist date movie might find it depressing. Still while it adheres to some of the genre conventions at least it dials down much of the sillier rom-com formula. Ryans teachings are simplistic bordering on inane He greets an adoring crowd with the same banal routine ""Im feeling OK. How are you?"" And they respond in unison with a trademark hand gesture yelling ""A-OK"" The film has an uneven tone unsure whether to mock Burkes rudimentary words of wisdom or play up his good intentions. Eloise is a floral designer unlucky in love who by her own admission never makes the right choices. In one of the more moving plot lines John Carroll Lynch convincingly plays Walter a mournful father whose life is derailed after the death of his young son. In a weird bit of retail therapy -- and to encourage Walters return to his contracting career -- Ryan rewards Walters soul-baring honesty with a group shopping excursion to Home Depot. As it turns out Love Happens sad side and its exploration of the devastating effects of loss is more compelling than its conventional romantic leanings.

CAST Aaron Eckhart Jennifer Aniston Dan Fogler Martin Sheen LENGTH 149 What happens when troubled self-help author Burke Ryan (Aaron Eckhart) meets disillusioned florist Eloise Chandler (Jennifer Aniston)? Love happens in ""Love Happens"" along with hearts flowers wine roses sweetness light and every other cliche the filmmakers can squeeze into a two-hour film. Want to know more? It begins with Burke using lemons to make lemonade. Later hell walk through fire and set a caged bird free. Eloise is slightly quirkier She scrawls arcane words in hidden places around Burkes hotel and keeps copies of her customers love notes (questionable habits both). advertisement | advertise on newsday Debut director Brandon Camp and his co-screenwriter Mike Thompson cant completely squash the natural charm of their lead actors who have their moments. But this film features not one but two grieving fathers (Martin Sheen and character actor John Carroll Lynch) and enough Stuart Smalleyisms to keep Al Franken in stitches. Only comedic actor Dan Fogler (""Taking Woodstock"") as Burkes energetic publicist remains likable throughout. Spoiler alert Here is Burkes final line ""When one thing ends something else begins.""

The reason? It is the kind of movie in which it feels like virtually nothing happens much less love. Love Happens Bad to fair Director Brandon Camp. Cast Aaron Eckhart Jennifer Aniston Martin Sheen. Rating PG-13 for some language including sexual references. Related Spotlight Jennifer Aniston Chick flicks Eckhart plays Burke Ryan a widower who has written a self-help manual called ""A-Okay"" He is in Seattle to lead a seminar about the books principles Participants walk through traffic and hold a ""candle of truth"" while revealing secrets about themselves. It is all a bit too cutesy. At his hotel Burke meets a florist named Eloise (Aniston) who is coming off a bad breakup. Other than the fact that they are both impossibly perfect looking the two seem to have little in common. Still a relationship blossoms. Writer and first-time director Brandon Camp has made an odd little film. It is hard to hate the finished product It is generally pleasant the cast is watchable and the movie virtually serves as a tourism commercial for Seattle (this despite the fact that Vancouver doubles for much of the city). But Camp never succeeds in showing what brings these two together. There is no heat between the actors and the script doesnt fill in the blanks. Outside of the physical you dont see what makes these two connect. Camp also does things like handing Eloise a silly little quirk in which she writes words like ""poppysmic"" on the hotel walls. Couldnt he have given Aniston a fleshed-out role to play instead? Burke is given a secret of his own but its not terribly difficult to guess. And because theres no mystery no chemistry and paper-thin characters the movie coasts by on the charms of its two stars. And while Eckhart and Aniston are mighty appealing they need to be given something more with which to work. But what can you say? Sometimes stuff happens.

"Love Happens movie review by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review Love Happens -- 2 out of 5 stars The possibility of a new romance leads a self-help guru to the realization that he has never truly confronted his wifes death. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Love Happens is a comedy in mourning a romance so sad that even Jennifer Aniston at her most engaging cant save it. The writer of the deadly Dragonfly has been promoted to writer-director for this one and despite having the same template as a hundred screen romances he cant make it work.Aaron Eckhart is Burke Ryan the prototypical lonely man in need of love. Hes a motivational speaker a guy getting rich running self-help get-over-grief seminars. His hook the one he cashed in on with his best-seller A-Okay is simple -- ""My wife died."" He and his manager (Dan Fogler half as funny as usual) are about to turn that hook into a huge multi-media deal. But our lonely man has a dark secret. They all do.Aniston is the quirky girl who can make him love again. Eloise is a florist who saves copies of the touching cards folks send with their flowers. She writes odd words from the dictionary like ""quidnunc"" behind the paintings at the Seattle hotel where Burke is giving a seminar. She has an oddball slam-poet employee-pal ( Judy Greer naturally). She even has the ""car with character"" a 60s vintage Ford Falcon delivery van. She has just bailed on her latest bad relationship. And when she meets Burke she blows him off by pretending to be deaf. Can these two lost souls find each other? Without him learning sign language?Whatever thin potential Love Happens had is utterly botched by co-writer/director Brandon Camp son of Benji filmmaker Joe Camp. He struggles to find a laugh in the first half hour delivers a nice comic confrontation that he never repeats and works in a funny bit about Burkes wifes cockatoo -- he calls it a ""parrot"" which he bird-naps from his bitter in-laws ( Martin Sheen).But Camp bogs down in the Dr. Phil side of the story -- Burkes efforts to ""help"" people and come to terms with his own grief .Eckhart plays ""broken"" for the whole movie and Aniston plays herself -- as a florist.Love Happens doesnt bring tears and whats worse doesnt create sparks. Thats a crying shame.Love HappensTwo of five starsCast Aaron Eckhart Jennifer AnistonDirector Brandon CampRunning time 1 hour 47 minutesIndustry rating PG-13 for some language including sexual references.
