Clocking De Niros genial crows feet fringing bewildered eyes we arent surprised when they all cancel one David doesnt even bother to do that. So Frank decides to spring visits on each of them which is the family-drama equivalent of picking up a hitchhiker in a horror flick. If Amy (Kate Beckinsale) Rosie (Drew Barrymore) and Robert (Sam Rockwell) are such great kids why are they neglecting their lonely dad? And wheres David? As Frank a former telephone-cable installer traverses the country it becomes clear that the Goode communication lines are down. Where did he go wrong?Forget Hollywood remakes; this is one film Id like to see reworked by an arthouse director and a pack of actors with smaller names and bigger reserves of subtlety (Rockwell can keep his role though). The literalist approach of British director Kirk Jones (Nanny McPhee) sucks all interest from Franks travels and rarely has a neat ending seemed less appropriate. Phone cables are being superseded but our connections with loved ones fray and corrode forever.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Dec. 03 2009 144PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Everybodys Fine Directed and written by Kirk Jones Starring Robert De Niro Drew Barrymore Sam Rockwell Classification PG If nothing else (and there aint much else) Everybodys Fine does prove one thing Even an actor with the gifts of Robert De Niro cant make bland interesting. Saddled with playing Frank Goode a character about as compelling as his name a clearly befuddled De Niro struggles to find something anything to make us care about this ho-hum guy - struggles and then pretty much admits defeat. ""Attention must be paid"" wrote the playwright about another common man. But Willy Loman with his tragic flaws and redeeming virtue deserved our attention. Frank Goode barely merits a glance. Thats because hes trapped in a script that needs him to be recognizably ordinary - essentially good occasionally not - but doesnt know how to give his ordinariness any dramatic weight or conviction. Instead the narrative gets loose and then downright gimmicky. This is a remake of the Guiseppe Tornatore film Stanno Tutti Benne  and although the map has shifted to America the compass is every bit as wonky. Matters start in the Northeast where the recently widowed Frank has settled into a bored retirement from his blue-collar job reduced to inventing ways to tidy up his already impeccable suburban house. His four children are all adults now scattered across the country and also adroit at inventing things - mainly polite excuses not to visit their father. So Frank despite his frail lungs heads out to serially visit them and darned if we dont have a road movie. Seen through Franks rose-coloured glasses his offspring are uniformly happy and hugely successful David (Austen Lysy) is a talented artist in Manhattan; Amy (Kate Beckinsale) a rich ad-exec in Chicago; Robert (Sam Rockwell) a symphony conductor in Denver; and Rosie (Drew Barrymore) a headlining dancer in Vegas. Well guess what They arent what he thinks they are arent nearly that successful or all that happy. Seems that first his late wife and then the kids themselves have contrived to cocoon him in a tissue of half-truths and outright lies. Why? Check this out ""You always worried too much if everything wasnt perfect."" Sorry but in the annals of family dysfunction excessive worrying isnt much of a dramatic hook. Whats less when Frank tracks down the deceivers and the scales slowly fall from his eyes its not as if he gets upset staring down truths barrel. However wrong-headed ol Dad may have been in the past hes definitely right-hearted now loving his brood even with their masks removed and intent only on ""getting us all around the same table"" for Christmas. Fine and ""goode"" indeed but it gives poor De Niro zilch to work with. With no character to explore he almost seems to retreat into himself instead and an actor who so often lit up the screen disappears right off it. For his part writer-director Kirk Jones (who cut his teeth on Waking Ned Devine  then dulled them on NannyMcPhee ) doesnt do much to help. He tries to give Frank a few comic encounters on the road and were keen to work with him there but our labours come up well short of a laugh - maybe a faint chuckle or two. Okay when a little comedy fails how about a big tragedy? Cant give it away although I can offer you a cost-saving tip Buy the popcorn but dont shell out for any tissues. The search for tears is contrived at best and maudlin the rest of the time. Seldom has suffering seemed so sweet and neat all the painful loose ends nicely tied up before the snow falls and the bells jingle. Of course tis the season for this kind of picture and I dont mean to suggest its a complete turkey. Its not but thats just another problem with bland - you cant even get a good hate going.

Comments click to enlarge Everybodys Fine Rated PG-13  95 minutes  2009 A retired widower (Robert De Niro) ignored by his grown children sets off on a road trip to connect with each of them and discovers that for years hes been turning a blind eye to their problems. He cant communicate with people though hes spent his career manufacturing PVC coating for telephone wires which his cross-country train rides give him ample opportunity to gaze at out the window. A remake of an Italian drama by Giuseppe Tornatore (director of Cinema Paradiso) this is sentimental but dramatically solid its placid themes fortified by De Niro (who could certainly do worse these days) and as his kids Kate Beckinsale Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore. British filmmaker Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) directed his own script. By J.R.

TRAILER Check and see if Everybodys Fine Everybodys Fine a remake of Giuseppe Tornatores Stanno Tutti Bene (1990) is raised by the nuanced performance of Robert De Niro as Frank a stoic widower and father of four grown children. But its a syrupy downbeat film. The story opens with Frank planning a family dinner expecting all his children to attend. Instead he is met with cancellations and excuses. He takes it in stride realizing his conduit to his children was his deceased wife. Like many fathers of his generation Frank was focused on providing for his family. While he didnt connect emotionally he was intent on their success. Ironically his job was all about connections -- he installed coating on telephone wires for a living. He embarks on a road trip to visit his kids and en route chats up fellow bus passengers garrulously. Meant to be funny it comes off contrived. Franks first stop is the New York home of his artist son who is not home. Frank moves on to Chicago and his advertising executive daughter Amy (Kate Beckinsale). Theres an awkwardness in the air. Then hes off to Denver to visit his son Robert (Sam Rockwell) anxious to see him in his job as a symphony conductor. Disappointments ensue. His final stop is Las Vegas where his bubbly daughter Rosie (Drew Barrymore) a dancer is eager to impress him. Reality slowly dawns on Frank as secrets lies and painful realities emerge. Though De Niro gives a strong performance as a loving if not always perceptive dad the film takes a treacly turn grows truly sad and never fully recovers.

(Miramax Film Corp.) Joe Neumaier Thursday December 3 2009 639 PM Title Everybodys Fine Getting the details right counts for a lot. ""Everybodys Fine"" - a more subtle film than its advertising indicates - works because it has a feel for little things. Like how a widower looks away when he says he doesnt still speak to a wife who isnt there or how grown children know what word irks their dad who in a glance can see them as the 5-year-olds they once were.British writer/director Kirk Jones remake of a 1990 Italian movie also contains whats become a rarity A sweet human-size Robert De Niro performance. The two-time Oscar-winner and one-man Mount Rushmore of New York was in danger of being defined by big comedies (""Analyze This"" ""Meet the Parents"" and their sequels) and small catastrophes (""Righteous Kill"" ""Hide and Seek""). Here the actor dials it down and wins us over.Frank Goode is a 70-ish former blue-collar worker dealing with the loss of his wife of 41 years by obsessing over housekeeping tasks he never knew existed. When his four busy kids all cancel on a family reunion he had planned Frank travels by bus and train to surprise them.Yet he is the one who gets the real surprise as he learns that the people he helped raise arent entirely happy. One daughter Amy (Kate Beckinsale) is a hot-shot Chicago lawyer with an unsuccessful marriage. Another daughter Rosie (Drew Barrymore) is a Vegas dancer living an echo of the life she dreamed of as is Robert (Sam Rockwell) a member of the Denver orchestra though not the renowned conductor his father thought he was.The mystery of the fourth sibling is the narrative hook but the emotional thread is a series of lovely scenes that work as one-acts about familial disappointment and dashed hopes. De Niros scenes with the always engaging Rockwell are particularly good loaded with forced friendliness laced with recriminations and empty promises.Beckinsale and Barrymore also do a lot with very little taking their cues from De Niro whos in every scene. As Frank crisscrosses the country Jones (""Waking Ned Devine"" ""Nanny McPhee"") fills the movie with random connections that recall everything from ""Harry and Tonto"" to ""About Schmidt."" And theres as much real appreciation here for empty bus stations and antiseptic offices as there is for peoples interior narratives. Jones even manages to convey how a working-class guy like Frank would be both proud and slightly confused about his childrens creative paths.In its final third ""Everybodys Fine"" tries to hit a few too many emotional notes and wrap things up in a bow but the overall result isnt damaged. Turns out you can mess up a little bit and still produce a winner. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Everybodys Fine The lies that bind | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesEverybodys Fine The lies that bindExpect an uncomfortable moment while watching Everybodys Fine . Youre not the only one who edits events and polishes the truth to protect your parents - and yourself. Worse they know it.Kate Beckinsale and Robert De Niro in Everybodys Fine.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Dec. 4 2009 Starring Robert De Niro Kate Beckinsale Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore. Directed by Kirk Jones. 100 minutes. At major theatres. PG Expect an uncomfortable moment while watching Everybodys Fine. Youre not the only one who edits events and polishes the truth to protect your parents - and yourself. Worse they know it.Retired factory worker Frank (an effortlessly average Robert De Niro) is feeling at loose ends with the recent death of his wife rattling around in their suburban home tending to the garden and yard. Hes the kind of older man you see staring in puzzlement at cuts of meat in the grocery store.His grown kids all of whom had promised to come home for a weekend for the first time since their mothers funeral have bailed at the last minute amid a flurry of apologies. So Frank decides to visit them ignoring the advice of his doctor by embarking on a cross-country tour.Article Continued BelowHe plans to surprise his brood dropping in on each David the successful Gotham artist; Amy the happily married Chicago ad exec; Robert who conducts an orchestra in Denver; and Rosie the headlining Las Vegas dancer.But David is nowhere to be found in Manhattan and when he gets to the modernist showplace of Amy (Kate Beckinsale) he finds the grandson whos supposed to be top of his class (a very competent Lucian Maisel in a small role) is struggling in school and theres some awkwardly concealed frost at the family dinner table.The revelations pile up as he crosses the country even as the kids continue their father-protecting fibbing. Robert (Sam Rockwell) comes clean immediately seeming relieved to have been caught in his lies while sweet Rosie (Drew Barrymore) has the most baggage but cant bear to disappoint her dad. The kids all hustle Frank to the door with made-up excuses about busy schedules and commitments while he pretends hes not on to them. He asks for assurances about their happiness and each gives the answer he or she thinks dad wants to hear.Based on Cinema Paradiso writer-director Giuseppe Tornatores Stanno Tutti Bene British director Kirk Jones brings the same gentle humorous touch exhibited in Waking Ned Devine to Everybodys Fine.With so many lives to explore Jones has a lot of ground to cover and there are times when it would be helpful to know more about these people if we are to sympathize with their struggles.The story offers some fine funny touches and just enough sentiment to tug at the heartstrings. Jones cleverly uses childhood versions of his adult actors to reveal unspoken truths.De Niro is his usual stellar self - wry and wise with a face that wears a smile like nobody elses.So its disappointing when the last reel goes off the rails with a sappy home-for-the-holidays endgame. These scenes feel as if they were tacked on to earn a seasonal release into theatres and betray the good intentions brought by the bulk of the film.I could say otherwise but Id be lying.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Everybodys Fine Drama. Starring Robert De Niro Sam Rockwell Kate Beckinsale and Drew Barrymore. Directed by Kirk Jones. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Let the sentiment reveal itself. Dont veer into sentimentality. Dont push. Just trust the story. Thats the whole trick with a movie like ""Everybodys Fine."" Nineteen years ago the Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore (""Cinema Paradiso"") made the original version of this story and he gave into every bad temptation - faux Fellini dream sequences and enough schmaltz to cover the Mediterranean coast. Now comes this American version which turns out to be the exception an American remake thats better than the European original. In retrospect Tornatore was probably just too young back then (in his early 30s) not to make something romantic out of old age. Writer-director Kirk Jones who is a decade older takes Tornatores central character a delusional old civil servant (a kind of feeble-minded version of De Sicas Umberto D.) and transforms him into a blue-collar American guy who bought into the American dream. Played by Robert De Niro Frank has a major investment in his childrens success. His self-conception is riding on it. The setup is simple. Dad a recent widower finds out that none of his four grown children will be flying out for a planned holiday get-together. So he decides to go to them to travel to the various cities where they live and surprise each one. But wherever he goes he finds a strained welcome and hints that their lives might be quite different from what theyve told him. To enjoy ""Everybodys Fine"" you have to accept that its possible in a modern American family for adult children to misrepresent their careers or hide from their father major life changes such as divorce and childbirth. Accept that and ""Everybodys Fine"" becomes a satisfying family story that accomplishes something unlikely but essential. It establishes convincing family dynamics that allow audiences to believe that Kate Beckinsale Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore are siblings and that De Niro is their father. I particularly enjoyed Rockwell who slips easily into a roughneck mold playing a workaday musician and Barrymore who has within her a natural capacity to be a very satisfying daughter. Clearly the director worked with his actors in establishing a family history and a pattern of relationships. Were never told the backstory but its suggested in the texture of the interaction. One child (Barrymore) was Daddys favorite. Another steered clear. Another made points by excelling in school. Another could do nothing right. Finally De Niro gets to make a good movie. -- Advisory The movie contains one brief shining outburst of profanity.

"Everybodys Fine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; everybody-s-fine ) Everybodys Fine (United States 2009) December 03 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Everybodys Fine explores universal themes - concepts that many sitting in the audience will relate to from one perspective or another. Its about the ways in which the expectations of a parent can shape the life of a child - both in terms of what he or she will do to satisfy those expectations and how a failure to live up to them can create a rift. The movie also recalls the Harry Chapin song ""Cats in the Cradle"" which is about a father who is too busy for his son when the child is young but has the tables turned on him later in life - by the time Dad has the time the son is preoccupied. The same dynamics introduced in the song are at work in the lives of the characters presented in this film. British-born director Kirk Jones (Nanny McPhee Waking Ned Devine) is re-working a 1990 film by celebrated Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore (Cinema Paradiso). The original starred Marcello Mastroianni in the role now inhabited by Robert DeNiro. Jones tones down some of the strong emotions found in Tornatores movie giving this interpretation a more low-key tone. The approach is double-edged it mutes the movies impact but also lessens the sense of manipulation. Everybodys Fine works on its own terms as a road movie in which an aging man embarks upon an unexpected journey of self-discovery where he finds that some of the ""cornerstones"" of his life are not as certain as he believes them to be. The veil of willful blindness is lifted. As the film opens recent widower Frank (DeNiro) is planning for a visit from his four grown-up children; they havent been together since the funeral of his wife eight months ago. One-by-one however they cancel citing job pressures. Recognizing that his health is failing and he might not have long to live Frank makes the impulsive decision to go on the road and visit his children one-by-one. He wants to get to know who they have become. They were close to their mother but not to him. He was the breadwinner who pushed them to aspire to greatness but not the parent they could confide in. His first stop is in New York where his youngest son David an artist lives. David is not home - we soon learn from another source that he is having drug problems and is in Mexico. Traveling by bus and train Frank heads west to Chicago where he surprises his advertising executive daughter Amy (Kate Beckinsale) who does what she can to hide the obvious rift that has developed between herself and her husband. After spending only a night with Amy Frank moves on to Denver where his son Robert (Sam Rockwell) has established his home. Frank had been led to believe Robert is an orchestra conductor but in fact he is only a percussionist. Franks final stop is Las Vegas where his youngest daughter Rosie (Drew Barrymore) lives. In an effort to impress him she borrows a spacious apartment from a friend and passes it off as her own and introduces Franks grandchild as an infant shes baby-sitting for. Frank is savvy enough to see through the illusions conjured by his children and recognizes they are pretending because they dont want to disappoint him by showing areas of their lives where they have fallen short of his aspirations for them. Robert DeNiro gives an amazing portrayal- one that is remarkable because he is playing an ordinary man. DeNiro best known for his larger-than-life roles in both dramas and comedies provides a natural understated performance. Theres nothing extraordinary about Frank and therein lies the genius of the actors work. DeNiro successfully erases his personality and we are left with only Frank a solid working man who is bored with retirement and struggling to find his place in a world where his everyday constants - his wife and his job - are no longer around. There were times when I looked at Frank and saw my grandfather. On other occasions I caught a glimpse of my father. And once or twice I even saw future echoes of myself. Everybodys Fine doesnt strike as forceful an emotional chord as the original. Jones builds a wider buffer between the characters and the audience. The movie works because so much of whats on screen will resonate with viewers. The movie has its share of gently comedic moments but it is mostly a drama. It follows the general trajectory of a road movie although this is a case when reaching the final stop is important because its as much a psychological destination as a geographical one. The original Italian version is not obscure (although I donat believe its available on Region 1 DVD) but this is an effective re-packaging and is worth the 90-odd minutes spent in the theater joining Frank on his journey of self-discovery.

(Abbot Genser/miramax) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday December 4 2009 ""Everybodys Fine"" arrives like a bolt out of some distantly remembered past when they made movies about recognizable human beings engaged in real if flawed relationships where the stakes are high even if the family van doesnt turn into a giant robot. This StoryEverybodys Fine De Niros Fine holiday journeyWatch Everybodys Fine trailerFind showtimes This wistful gently moving family drama stars Robert De Niro as Frank a retired telephone company employee and widower who as the movie opens is eagerly preparing for a reunion with his grown children at Thanksgiving. Within the first few minutes of ""Everybodys Fine"" which is based on Giuseppe Tornatores 1990 film of the same name its clear that its going to be a heartbreaker The first clue is the dignified befuddlement with which Frank asks a clueless supermarket clerk to recommend an expensive wine. When Franks high-achieving kids fail to show he decides to visit them embarking on a cross-country journey of often brutal self-discovery. Kate Beckinsale Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore deliver fine performances as Franks busily self-involved children but ""Everybodys Fine"" is De Niros picture through and through. Like he did in the woefully under-seen ""What Just Happened"" he turns in a subtle poignant performance as a man who has become an alien in his own family. When he contemplates a wheeled suitcase with faint bemusement he resembles nothing less than E.T.; hes a walking embodiment of vulnerability and loss. Everybody should see ""Everybodys Fine."" But one piece of advice Phone home first.  PG-13. At area theaters.

When we meet De Niro a solitary guy vacuuming his generic suburban ranch house we think witness relocation program. In a minute well see a flashback to his career as a bank robber the heist where it all went bad a Fred Thompson cameo as the gruff FBI chief who packs him off to Palookaville maybe a comic montage of Bobbys arguments with the paperboy and the school crossing guard. Only no. Theyre playing this one straight. Painfully straight. The soundtrack over De Niros housekeeping scene is ""Catch a Falling Star"" and a sense of requiem for a heavyweight reverberates throughout this holiday-themed reconciliation saga. Soon the echoes of the larky charming Perry Como song are drowned by the gears of a formulaic plot clicking into place. De Niro plays a retired widower prepping his empty house for a homecoming. His grown kids are scattered nationwide. Kate Beckinsale is a married ad agency chief in Chicago Drew Barrymore works at a Vegas casino Sam Rockwells a classical musician in Denver. For reasons you will predict if youve ever seen a crumbling-but-coping family holiday movie the reunion misfires so De Niro travels the country to drop in on each of his children unannounced. In what universe could these surprise visits happen? Why in the same fantasy dimension where De Niros doctor sternly warns him against plane travel and gives him a skimpy supply of anti-death pills. Writer/director Kirk Jones who displayed a feel for broad naive comedy in ""Nanny McPhee"" and ""Waking Ned Devine"" is adrift here. He has no grasp of the subtler emotional shadings needed to elevate a stereotypical Christmas flick. Instead he pours on the syrup thick. Jones clumsily establishes that De Niros trade was producing telephone wires. And yet he cant communicate with his kids see? The film includes so many shots of phone poles youd think it was an ATamp;T documentary. On his cross-country tour De Niro doesnt tread much new ground. The films look at family secrets and lies is familiar stuff. Beckinsales brittle high-powered exec lives in the kind of modernist mansion that screams ""Unhappy Unfulfilled"" Barrymore so delicious in the underappreciated roller derby romp ""Whip It"" does her misty-eyed sweetness routine as an aging little girl lost. Only Rockwell supplies much spark as an orchestra musician who didnt fulfill his dads expectations. Rockwell is spiky enough to be De Niros kin bringing an undercurrent of angst and bitterness to his role. Perhaps thats why the sight of him wearing a Santa hat is so disconcerting. The other siblings could only have arrived in this flabbergasting family unit via an adoption agency with a taste for practical jokes. EVERYBODYS FINE  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic elements and brief strong language. As for De Niro Jones script requires him to perform with a sanitized uninflected sweetness utterly at odds with his edgy electrical power. This out-of-character role isnt a stretch for the finest American actor of his generation. Its a four-eggnog snooze.

Not a fuzzy com- edy its a bittersweet weeper about a fathers attempts at reconnection.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted December 04 2009From 1970 to 1990 Robert De Niro was the yardstick by which other actors measured themselves. This godfather raging bull goodfella was the champagne of bottled rage as one observer nicely put it.Yet for the last two decades despite occasional fine work as an actor (Heat The Score) director (A Bronx Tale The Good Shepherd) and citizen (the Tribeca Film Festival) De Niro is best known for paycheck performances in swill like Righteous Kill and Analyze That.So it is with great pleasure that I report that his pensive performance in Everybodys Fine the Americanization of Giuseppe Tornatores 1990 family drama Stanno tutti bene is up there with his best.Though billed as a fuzzy holiday comedy Everybodys Fine is a prickly bittersweet weeper about a fathers attempts at reconnection and reconciliation with his four far-flung children. De Niro plays his character completely contained afraid to brim or overflow with emotion. The more he pulls back the more he pulls in the audience.Frank Goode (De Niro) recent retiree and widower lives alone in his tidy home in Elmira N.Y. He hopes to fill the void left by his beloved wife with the laughter and bustle of his grown children and grandson over a family reunion weekend. One by one they call to make their excuses.If the kids cant come to him Frank reasons he will go to them. At first he cant see them as the adults they are but rather as the 8- and 10-year-olds they were. Its hard to connect when theres no bond there. The irony in the films guiding (if overworked) visual metaphor is that Frank himself not much of a communicator manufactured the PVC coating for the utility wires that carry the phone calls among his family members. Those fraying drooping wires represent what is left of the Goode family ties.The early sequences of the film directed by Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) who also adapted the script have some drollery with Frank consulting the supermarket oracles - the butcher the wine stockboy the guy selling gas grills - for advice on catering and preparing the family meal.Now he has to be both mother and father to his kids. But as it transpires though he was a good provider Frank wasnt emotionally available to his children. His late wife did the parenting.Jones structures the movie as a mystery in which Frank must ferret out the secret each son and daughter is concealing. Why isnt his artist son answering the door at his Manhattan studio? Why is his account executive daughter (Kate Beckinsale) so stressed about her husband and son in Chicago? Why did his musician son (the very fine Sam Rockwell) in Denver represent that he was a conductor of the orchestra rather than a percussionist? Why is his dancer daughter in Vegas (an even finer Drew Barrymore) so skittish?Though Frank has challenges in keeping his family connected De Niros minimalist performance has maximum emotional impact and succeeds in unifying the episodic film. I wept. So will you.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + It takes some effort to neutralize the charm of a modestly charismatic Robert De Niro performance. But ""Everybodys Fine does a stupendous job. De Niro plays - humanizing name alert - Frank Goode a widower crossing the country by train and bus to drop in on the four adult children who are too busy to visit him. Franks journey has been made under the assumption that we possess desperate hearts and strained carrots for brains.Whenever Frank sees one of his kids or waits to see one the score flares up like an orchestral rash. And as he regards them - three are played by Kate Beckinsale (Chicago) Sam Rockwell (Denver) and best of all Drew Barrymore (Las Vegas); the little-seen fourth a son is in trouble in Mexico - the movie keeps cutting to actual kids. This is stupid. We can tell from De Niros wistful expression what he sees in these grown-ups is the children they used to be.Frank made his living coating Americas telephone wires in PVC a chemical thats now made him vaguely ill (his doctor urges him not to fly). And after he leaves one child to surprise the next one the camera pulls right up to a drooping strand of wire and we hear the siblings squawking away on their telephones about what do for the brother in Mexico and whether to tell dad.Not even the 1990 Giuseppe Tornatore movie that ""Everybodys Fine is based on was that shameless. The original had a lot of problems. Its been almost 20 years but I think audiences all over the world are still in sugar shock. Still it also had the natural Italian landscape to traverse Tornatores affecting ideas about the emotional downside of living too long a life and a keen awareness of how to make the movie a meaningful showcase for its star Marcello Mastroianni.Kirk Jones (""Waking Ned Devine) wrote and directed this Hollywood version. And the sentimentality he glops on is meant to bring out the bittersweet nature of these relationships. But theres something darker roiling untapped beneath this material. Have Franks high expectations made his family pathologically incapable of leveling with him? That pathology extends to Jones who perfumes most of the scenes with some form of cuteness. The movies big confessional happens as a hallucination in which Frank cross-examines the young incarnations of his kids Youve all been lying to me Suddenly a cloying family dramedy turns into an episode of ""Law amp; Order Childrens Television Workshop.Once its clear the movie wont be deviating at all from its formula Franks journey gets tedious. But De Niro handles himself with rare care. Hes spent most of this decade playing goons and grumps so its heartening to see that hes still interested in etching the contours of such a proud ebullient life-size character. Frank is a side of De Niro weve never seen. So theres immense pleasure to be had in the sight of this great craftsman actor simply making googly eyes at a baby or waving his arms to trip a light sensor. He reminded me of the airborne codger in ""Up. This movie is a condolence card. His performance belongs somewhere better in say a movie about a house lifted aloft by a giant balloon bouquet.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Time has reduced many of the idiosyncratic American leading men of the 70s into harmless adorable senior citizens. Dustin Hoffman and Richard Dreyfuss appear onscreen these days almost exclusively as cutesy old codgers. Now a neutered Robert De Niro plays a widower who dodders around the country visiting his grown children in Everybodys Fine a schmaltzy Americanization of Giuseppe Tornatores 1990 Italian drama. De Niros demanding ways and impossibly high standards are supposed to have scarred each of his children profoundly during their formative years but the harsh taskmaster of the past bears only the fuzziest resemblance to the nice old man of the present who seems to demand nothing more than a bowl of soup and maybe the occasional nap. In a sleepy lead performance De Niro plays a widower who let his wife handle the lions share of parenting duties while he devoted himself to his job. In the aftermath of his wifes death however he realizes just how little he knows his four children so when they opt out of attending a family reunion he decides to hit the road. If they wont come to him hell come to them. Everybodys Fine follows a dispiritingly predictable arc; De Niro visits his kids and learns that theyre each living a lie. His son Sam Rockwell isnt the hotshot conductor De Niro imagines him to be but rather a lowly percussionist. His high-powered businesswoman daughter Kate Beckinsale has a nuclear family that isnt anywhere near as perfect as De Niro had been led to believe. This dynamic is dull the first time around and it grows even less interesting with each mild variation. Viewers get no points for guessing whether the fate of De Niros most troubled child a tortured New York artist busted for drugs in Mexico will be revealed climactically in the films third act. Waking Ned Devine writer-director Kirk Jones does nothing to leaven the unashamed sentimentality that defines Tornatores cornball oeuvre In the films most nauseating trope De Niro initially sees each of his grown children as their adorable younger selves.  Even more than the remake that it is Everybodys Fine plays like a homogenized Hallmark Channel version of About Schmidt with all the rough edges shaved off.

View more ""Everybodys Fine"" photos HERE. ""Relief"" is the word for it. Its a relief to see Robert De Niro giving an honest effective starring performance in a project that does not stink and that in fact rises to a respectable level of filmmaking proficiency. How long has it been? ""Everybodys Fine"" may be as calculated a commercial product as the ""Meet the Parents""/""Meet the Fockers"" comedies (No. 3 to come next year) in which De Niros comic skills were stretched into cartoon broadness. But this Americanized remake of Giuseppe Tornatores 1990 ""Stanno Tutti Bene"" is gracefully acted by a very good cast headed by De Niro relaxing into a comfortable pair of shoes originally worn by Marcello Mastroianni. In the original Mastroianni portrayed a Sicilian pensioner on a journey to visit his grown offspring all of whom harbored secrets. The outline and various details of the original script remain in writer-director Kirk Jones Americanized adaptation. (Jones himself is English.) Frank Goode a retired wire factory worker and recent widower invites his four adult children to the upstate New York homestead for the holidays. One by one they stiff his invite offering wobbly excuses by phone about work and vague details regarding the whereabouts of their vagabond New York City artist sibling David.Against doctors orders Frank hits the trail traveling by train and bus mostly to see how the kids are doing one city at a time. First New York to no avail; then to Chicago where tightly wound daughter Amy (Kate Beckinsale) works in advertising and lives in a sleek but soulless home seemingly untouched by human hands or marital warmth. From there Frank ventures west to Denver to surprise his son Robert (Sam Rockwell) who Frank thinks is a conductor on the rise with a touring orchestra. Then its off to Las Vegas where Rosie (Drew Barrymore) a performer seems to be living well and baby-sitting for ""a friend."" The trek recalls Paul Mazurskys lovely ""Harry and Tonto"" (1974) though ""Everybodys Fine"" has little of Mazurskys funk or looseness. Its shot in a completely different style neat and square and in sync with De Niros portrayal of a quietly demanding patriarch. Frequently Jones who made ""Waking Ned Devine"" isolates Frank in cavernous hallways and separates father and son or daughter by acres of metaphoric visual space. As written scenes typically establish one point and then move on. The payoffs are all in the interactions. Watch for the way De Niro sitting down to dinner with the fractured Chicago wing of the family responds to the uneasy dynamics at play. De Niros later scenes with Rockwell bring out an interesting combination of reserve and openness in both. In a too-brief scene a trucker played by ""Frozen Rivers"" Melissa Leo picks up Frank. Nothing happens of consequence yet youre reminded of how our best long-haul performers have a way of bringing a lifetime of experience to a simple two-person encounter.No doubt some will feel theyve been run over by the pathos van with this thing. Its too bad Jones coda borders on emotional fraud. (Tornatores Italian original was pushier in its whimsy but more bittersweet at the core.) With gratifying reliability however the actors come riding to the rescue of the schematics.""Everybodys Fine"" is content to be a simple sincere heartwarmer. Ill take it over ""The Blind Side"" by 40 yards. mjphillipstribune.com Related Winters 10 most intriguing movies MPAA rating PG-13 (for thematic elements and brief strong language)Cast Robert De Niro (Frank Goode); Drew Barrymore (Rosie); Kate Beckinsale (Amy); Sam Rockwell (Robert); Katherine Moennig (Jilly); Melissa Leo (Colleen)Credits Written and directed by Kirk Jones based on the 1990 film ""Stanno Tutti Bene"" directed by Giuseppe Tornatore; produced by Gianni Nunnari Ted Field Vittorio Cecchi Gori and Glynis Murray.

Everybodys Fine Fair Director Kirk Jones. Cast Robert De Niro Sam Rockwell Drew Barrymore. Rating PG-13 for thematic elements and brief strong language. RELATED Robert De Niros Fine Family gatherings on film Spotlight Robert De Niro Spotlight Drew Barrymore Trust us. You dont have to be a Mensa member to get into a movie theater (good thing) and you certainly wouldnt have to be any genius to get at the emotional impact director Kirk Jones is going for in his remake of the 1990 Italian film. He has Robert De Niro for goodness sake acting his tail off in the story of an aging father who comes to realize how out of touch with his childrens lives he has become. He has retired from his longtime job working on the covering for telephone lines. A communications guy in other words who cant communicate with his own family. There. Get the irony? Thought so. But Jones hammers the point home with such insistence and repetition that it eventually becomes grating. Dude We get it already Too bad too because De Niros really good as Frank. (Not ""Taxi Driver"" perhaps but at least not ""Meet the Fockers"" either.) And there are some scenes that would have been genuinely touching had Jones left well enough alone. Frank whose wife died not long ago invites his children to a dinner - getting everyone around the same table again as he puts it. But in a genuinely moving series of events one by one each kid cancels. Wounded but determined Frank decides to pay each a surprise visit at their far-flung locations. Along the way hell learn how much he doesnt know about their lives how much they trusted in their mother instead of him. The rest of the cast does a nice-enough job. Kate Beckinsale is the harried career woman; Sam Rockwell a musician; Drew Barrymore a performer in Las Vegas. Yet each harbors a stock secret at least from Frank. They actually share all the details of their lives with each other something displayed with all the subtlety of a flying mallet with Jones repeated shots of the telephone lines Frank proudly observes on his travels as we overhear the conversations they have. But this is clearly De Niros movie existing mostly as a vehicle for his estimable talents (and if an awards nomination or two falls his way so much the better). He does all thats asked of him and more. Which probably is the problem. If the film becomes increasingly predictable the ending is pure sap. In that regard ""Everybodys Fine"" is a fitting title.

And although Franks not supposed to be a very sophisticated man it requires saintly moviegoing patience I clearly dont have to put up with his level of unworldliness. For one thing he shows up at the doorsteps of his four adult children who are scattered across America without calling ahead expecting each to be home. What it would kill him to pick up a phone? The guy spent a working lifetime manufacturing the protective coating that insulates telephone wire fer chrissakes. The contradiction counts as galumphing irony in this calculatedly soppy seasonally phony Americanized remake of Giuseppe Tornatores 1990 Stanno Tutti Bene -- which was bittersweet in the Italian original with Marcello Mastroianni as the poignant papa. Then theres this Frank who hasnt seen his brood since the death of their mother a few months earlier travels from kid to kid (each son or daughter secretly unhappy lying to their pop and not fine at all in his or her own way) by bus and train toting a sad rolling carry-on bag. Thing is Frank is the only American born in the age of Samsonite who doesnt know that rolling bags actually roll dont you know on little wheels that work quite well when the collapsible handle is extended and pulled. So until one of his kids clues him in he lifts carries and schleps like a grandpa from the old country. Well. The sight of the world-famous Robert De Niro a powerful actor revered for playing tough guys who can smash Samsonite with their bare hands pretending not to know how to pull a handle is so embarrassing that the ick ought to obscure the rest of the movies falsehoods. Yet as written and directed by British director Kirk Jones (Waking Ned Devine) with guidance apparently from Dr. Phil the movie introduces offspring who are correspondingly awful including Kate Beckinsale as a tense rich ad exec in Chicago Sam Rockwell as a drippy musician in Denver and Drew Barrymore as an alleged dancer in Las Vegas. As for the artist son in New York City jeez hes nowhere to be found. Naturally poor shnooky Frank just waits like a lox on the stoop of the kids scary downtown-y artisty and vagranty tenement building. At least he might have spent the time more profitably learning how to get his wheels rolling.

Its a marketing departments feeble feint The four actors appear onscreen together for only a handful of minutes late in the movie--and its no more a Christmas movie than Yentl.Actually this is writer-director Kirk Joness retelling of Giuseppe Tornatores Stanno tutti bene (1990) in which Marcello Mastroianni his failing eyes made to look like tiny black dots behind thick glasses traveled almost the entirety of Italy to surprise-visit his five grown children who for one reason or another couldnt make it home for a family reunion round the dinner table. It was an exquisite lush (that scenery) and wholly naturalistic bit of filmmaking about the painful secrets children keep from their parents and how grown-ups will always view their offspring as fragile eight-year-olds in need of prodding. Tornatore fresh off his glossy and nostalgic Cinema Paradiso proffered something that felt like documentary; Stanno tutti bennecontained moments so unflinching and intimate that you almost wanted to turn away and let the characters just share them in private. The bubbly feel-good of Cinema Paradiso had spoiled and in its place was vinegar.In a potentially inspired bit of casting De Niro takes over the Mastroianni role but his deadpan--intended to signify emptiness and ache--looks mostly like a somebody doing nothing. Mastroiannis mustache worked harder than De Niro does here. He plays Frank a widower who spent his entire life breathing in toxic fumes at a plant that manufactured PVC coating for telephone wires. Why has Jones given him that job? Because it allows for copious cutaways to phone lines over which Franks children--Robert (Rockwell) Rosie (Barrymore) and Amy (Beckinsale)--share grim news concerning their brother David an artist in Manhattan who has gone missing down Mexico way one among many secrets they keep from their father in their mothers absence. Its a dreary gimmick Rather than watching actors um act we see instead a screen filled with phone wires again and again and again. Its not a movie; its an audiobook.Frank who lives in upstate New York travels first to Manhattan to see David whos not home. He lingers on the stoop for hours; nothing happens save for a passing prostitutes half-hearted offer of a better way to kill a few hours. Franks sleepy. We know how he feels. Then hes off by bus to Chicago to see Amy a wildly successful ad exec who lives in a glass house perched on a lush hilltop. Alls not well there either Amys son Jack (Lucian Maisel) isnt quite the straight-A student Mom had said he was and the boy wants nothing to do with his father whom he ignores over a take-out Chinese dinner. But Frank lets it go; better not to ruin the illusion lest the glass house shatter and fall. ""I tell you the good news"" says Amy ""and spare you the bad."" Frank rushes off; who has time to talk?Next stop Denver where Roberts not an orchestra conductor as advertised but merely the guy banging the big drum in the back row. Father and son argue for a few moments Robert says he only went into music for Frank; Frank says he wanted better for his boy than to hit a drum. And . . . scene. Finally Frank heads to Las Vegas where Rosie says shes working as a dancer in a big Bellagio show. She shows off her fancy pad overlooking the tourist palaces; she says um yeah that baby is really a friends. Frank knows better. Oh but would you look at the time--gotta go theres a dream sequence ahead. (And its a low point in De Niros career.)So whats the point of all of this road-tripping to nowhere? Parents best intentions often get the better of their children? Sons and daughters keep secrets from their parents? Fathers with blinders on can only pretend to know best? Its awfully hard to remake Tornatore and Alexander Paynes About Schmidt at the same time? Robert De Niros only good at playing a dad in movies starring Ben Stiller? Its all so much raging bull.

Much of Kirk Jones family-reconciliation drama ""Everybodys Fine"" takes place on steadily moving trains Greyhounds and 18-wheelers appropriately enough for a film that moves reliably and ineluctably toward a well-mapped denouement. Though a bit too artful to merit the pejorative ""tearjerker"" label the film is rigorously streamlined to deliver a good emotional uppercut by the end and purely on the strength of its craft it connects. But aside from an atypically mannered Robert De Niro theres very little new to see along the way. Box office should be respectable for the Dec. 4 Miramax release. Helmer-scripter Jones adapted ""Everybodys Fine"" from Giuseppe Tornatores 1990 original and the two directors prove highly compatible counterparts. For one Jones shares Tornatores total lack of embarrassment with sentimentality and stock character types; Jones 1998 debut ""Waking Ned Devine"" deftly skirted the boundary where stereotypes cross over into archetypes. To call that film cliched or predictable would be entirely accurate yet also miss the point. So too with ""Everybodys Fine."" The trouble here is that while ""Waking Ned Devine"" had an entire towns worth of quirky characters to help move the narrative along this single-character-driven piece needs room to breathe and Jones never allows it (or the audience) to forget its ultimate destination; this may be the tautest most regimented movie ever made about a meandering road trip. Like Tornatore Jones is also an extremely literal filmmaker and when he intercuts scenes with footage of cross-country telephone wires or small talk about a huge gathering storm in the Atlantic the symbolic functions of both are so straightforward that they almost cease to be metaphors. Thus responsibility for providing the films complexity falls to De Niro (taking over the role played by Marcello Mastroianni in the original) and he mostly delivers. While his elderly traveling widower Frank Goode has shades of Jack Nicholsons Warren Schmidt (and a few overcooked scenes) its nonetheless a role De Niro makes his own and possibly his first to evoke sincere unironic goodness. The simmering rage and restless anxiety of his best roles are totally absent here as is the hamming of his more recent outings; in their place is a quiet contemplative intensity that suggests an inner life to the character beyond the machinations of the script. Alone at the beginning except for Perry Como on the soundtrack Frank prepares for a planned reunion with his four adult children -- their first meeting since the death of their mother eight months prior. He soon receives a barrage of phone calls from his kids all of whom cancel at the last minute. After a quick visit to his doctor (who warns him not to travel) Frank impulsively sets off to surprise his children in their homes conspicuously packing four envelopes all of which may just as well be stamped with ""Do not open until final reel."" First on the list is youngest son David a painter living in a disreputable New York neighborhood. The evidently cell phone-less Frank waits outside his door all night and when David fails to show up leaves an envelope under his door and heads on his way. Next is Amy (Kate Beckinsale) in Chicago an ad agency owner with a palatial home and seemingly consequent marriage problems then slacker classical musician Robert (Sam Rockwell) in Denver and finally Las Vegas dancer Rosie (Drew Barrymore). While Frank is between destinations we hear the three on the phone with one another slowly spilling details about Davids whereabouts -- which they conspire to keep secret from their father who concurrently begins to realize how much his children left out in their idealized descriptions of their own lives to him. Rockwell Beckinsale and Barrymore are in fine form here though they have precious little to do. Rockwell fares best perhaps because his segment of the film has no obvious sociopolitical points to make while Beckinsale is saddled with some of the films more stilted dialogue her character serving as little more than the proverbial career woman with a troubled family life. Melissa Leo has even less of a chance to leave an impression in her quick scene as a truck driver. Henry Brahams photography is quite strong unobtrusively capturing the particular melancholy of bus terminals chain hotel lobbies and roadside scenery. Other tech elements are above average.
