The operation goes disastrously wrong. However Lt Tyler (McConaughey sonambulent) a popular but frustrated officer proves his worth by navigating the U-boat plus its vital device into safe waters. Aided by persuasive effects and authoritative production design from Gotz (Das Boot) Weidner writer/director Mostow pays his dues to the genre but without much charge and even less depth. After an overextended landlocked prologue the film pits Tyler and his sub against the German navy in a series of efficient if predictable cat and mouse encounters. A natural climax eludes the film-makers and instead an endnote asks us with some gall to view this Americanised composite as a tribute to largely British actions during WWII.

PARKS Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle Published 530 am Friday April 21 2000 So how long has it been since you saw an old-fashioned World War II submarine movie? Well the folks at Universal think thats just too long. Theyre right. Grab your life jackets and hop aboard the U-571. Dont expect a quiet voyage. U-571 is a traditional thunder-and-sweat sub movie that should appeal to those old enough to remember Clark Gable in Run Silent Run Deep or Cary Grant in Destination Tokyo two of many pigboat movies based on World War II. But the intensity and action level has been jacked up several notches to make sure those who grew up on Raiders of the Lost Ark dont drift away with the tide. Theres also a plot gimmick to allow for a bit of hand-to-hand combat and give the events significance. During the early days of World War II the Germans Enigma machine allowed the Nazis to transmit information in a code the Allies had a devil of a time breaking. In the Atlantic German U-Boat (undersea boat) 571 is attacked by an Allied destroyer. It escapes badly damaged. It has to request a supply sub be sent to its rescue. Deducing a U-Boat is in trouble the U.S. Navy sends the S-33 one of the old World War I-era pigboats that made up most of Americas submarine fleet in the early days of the war. The crew is to capture the U-571 before the Enigma machine aboard can be destroyed. Aboard the S-33 are an experienced captain (Bill Paxton); his popular but not yet tough enough executive officer Lt. Tyler (Matthew McConaughey); a wise salty old sea dog of a chief (Harvey Keitel); and a hotshot Marine commando (David Keith). All are characters out of many movies past. Also in the crew is Lt. Emmett (Jon Bon Jovi); a radioman who speaks fluent German (Jack Noseworthy); and a mess cook (T.C. Carson). The S-33 and its crew are to masquerade as the German supply sub board the U-571 and take over before their ruse is discovered. But in war and action films the best-laid plans go awry. This one goes from bad to worse to heaven help us The American crew whats left of it ends up commandeering the U-571 and goes through a watery hell including a sub-to-sub torpedo duel a surface face-off with a large Nazi warship ruined engines torpedo tubes that wont open instructions in German tense moments from a Nazi scout plane a near mutiny and more loud teeth-rattling depth-charge scenes than Gable and Grant went through put together. Director and co-screenwriter Jonathan Mostow crams in every idea and cliche from those old World War II movies including taking the boat to a depth far greater than its supposed to go and sending out wreckage and bodies through the tubes to convince the enemy theyve been destroyed. He didnt have a radar-guided torpedo turn back on its own ship -- remember this is World War II -- but he does have the Marine leader tell his men to ""lock and load"" before a raid. Its a wham-bam bumpy ride great fun in the old-fashioned war movie tradition. U-571 is straight-ahead adventure with little of the hyped-up moral introspection or character focus of say Rules of Engagement and other modern war-related movies. If you were left cold by Rules of Engagements ambiguities youll be glad to know that here the good guys and the bad guys are clearly defined and everybody knows the job that needs to be done. The Nazis are not portrayed as the one-dimensional demons of 1940s films but they definitely are the enemy. Nor does this film portray Americans as bad or bloodthirsty or cowards. Theyre the heroes and they act like it. Truth is the films weak point is characterization. Perhaps Mostow decided the best way to avoid the cliches of submarine movie characters is to just avoid character. A minor conflict does erupt briefly between the captain and Lt. Tyler. The captain thwarted Tylers promotion; he thinks hes not ready for tough decisions. When he tells Tyler to stop being buddies with the crew because one day he may have to sacrifice individuals for the good of the group we know that situation will come up soon. McConaughey is OK as the hero but doesnt get much chance to register in an underwritten part. Keitel has a couple of good moments in what must be one of his most low-key roles ever and the reliable Keith is as usual a convincing commando. Mostow (Breakdown Flight of Black Angel) does better at directing and plot than at characterization. The movie is shot in a straightforward style. He avoids the choppy editing approach many action films take. It would be anachronistic in this film. The films look is wonderfully rich and authentic thanks to director of photography Oliver Wood and production designer Gotz Weidner. The inside of the sub is dark sodden and claustrophobic. Its no surprise that Weidner was art director of the best of all World War II submarine films Das Boot (The Boat) the German film that set the high-water mark for the genre (in the original 1981 version). But U-571 is a light adventure with none of Das Boots resonant characters and powerful message of wars horror. After recent war films that have (appropriately) shown the carnage of war in stomach-churning detail U-571 is a step back to a less gruesome style that looks away from the gore. That and its more ""grand adventure"" tone are reflected in its PG-13 rating.

Starring Matthew McConaughey Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow. (PG-13. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Heres a surprising statistic One quarter of all the Allied ships sunk in the battle of the Atlantic went down right off the Eastern seaboard of the United States. In the early days of World War II the Atlantic was crawling with Nazi submarines. Hitler knew if he could keep American soldiers and supplies from reaching Europe he could win the war. ""U-571"" which opens today is based on a bit of history that most of us never read about in school. Its about the Allied effort to steal the Enigma the device that allowed Nazi officials to communicate with their submarines without detection. A fictional composite of several real- life missions the film is two hours of nonstop nail-biting tension and anxiety. Related Stories Tension Beneath the Surface / `U-571 a nail-biting submarine thriller In fact if theres anything wrong with ""U-571"" its that its too effective -- at times almost unbearable. If watching a two-hour submarine movie is this nerve-shattering imagine what the real thing must have been like. Writer-director Jonathan Mostow in an apparent labor of love has created a film drenched with atmosphere -- drenched is the right word. The old-fashioned subs depicted here are creaky contraptions that spring leaks constantly and whose walls groan from the pressure. Dark and cramped they are floating tombs and Mostow never lets the audience forget their death- trap potential. Matthew McConaughey plays Tyler an executive officer who starts the film smarting that he has been passed over for promotion by his commanding officer (Bill Paxton). Tyler wants his own ship but the commander doesnt think hes ready. LEADERSHIP QUALITIES Paxton has a memorable moment when he explains to Tyler the qualities required in a ships captain. The key quality is not noble but necessary Its the ability to send soldiers into deadly situations without hesitation or regret. Paxton leaves the audience in no doubt he can do that. McConaughey leaves the audience in no doubt that he cant -- not yet. ""U-571"" among other things is the story of a good soldier who under pressure grows into a commander. To compare ""U-571"" to ""Saving Private Ryan"" is like comparing a miniature to a mural but there is one point of similarity The audience is made to feel the full weight and terror of combat. In the first minutes of the movie Tyler (McConaughey) and a small group of men disguised as Nazis have to board a disabled German submarine and wrest control of it from its crew. Mostow gives us a long beautiful shot of the men paddling on their rafts moving slowly toward the submarine. The water is choppy; the night is thick and dark. The Germans are shouting ""Ahoy ahoy"" (in subtitle) and the Americans are frozen with fear. Before a shot has been fired its already horrible. CRISIS AFTER CRISIS Thats just the beginning. Think of every bad thing that can happen on a submarine. Now think up a few more. In several scenes the men stand bracing themselves as depth charges explode around them. There is nothing they can do but wait to get blown up. One could argue that the films strong impact is largely a matter of pacing. Had Mostow left viewers with enough time to pinch themselves and remember its only a movie ""U-571"" might just have been a routine war film. But the crises pile on too quickly for sober reflection and the performances do nothing to spoil the carefully crafted illusion. McConaughey takes the audience on every step of Tylers journey of self-discovery. He is to put it simply a man who finds out how tough he is. Harvey Keitel brings his rough-edged integrity to the role of the ships chief a combat veteran of World War I. No women appear in ""U-571"" after the first scene. The picture takes place entirely in a world of men and deals with that male thing war -- a great evil that strangely enough can occasionally bring out the best traits in its participants. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence. ..

The submarine goes deep but the story never does in ""U-571"" a good old-fashioned WWII picture that is exciting in only the most superficial way. Well crafted but consisting almost exclusively of suspense and action high points with little modulation and even less characterization Jonathan Mostows follow-up to his masterfully tense debut ""Breakdown"" has the requisite thrills and chills to become a popular popcorn picture with mainstream audiences worldwide even if its as disposable as the popcorn box when its over. A fictionalized account of the Allied (but historically speaking mostly British) effort to break the Nazis Enigma code by capturing an enemy submarine with one of the coding machines on board the films story unfolds in an exceedingly mechanical way as if written in strict adherence to nuts-and-bolts principles taught in a screenwriting course. The picture gets the job done where it counts for the modern public in terms of the instant gratification provided by the special effects technical verisimilitude multiple climaxes and even politically correct elements. But it has no emotional or moral weight at all leaving it leagues behind the classic it clearly means to emulate and in some instances explicitly imitates Wolfgang Petersens ""Das Boot."" Set in the spring of 1942 a time when Hitlers U-boats were seriously disrupting Allied shipping in the North Atlantic and along the U.S. East Coast pic has drawn on a number of actual events to shape a streamlined tale of a boatload of largely inexperienced American sailors who are put to the test in a hurry when pitted against the German Navy. Opening sequence set aboard the title vessel quickly presents the extremes of submarine service as the Nazi crews exhilaration at a spectacular direct hit against an Allied ship is followed by the horror of an attack by depth charges which heavily damages the boat. Knowing that the disabled sub with an Enigma transmitter is within range the Yanks snap into action in an attempt to reach the U-571 before a German rescue craft can. To outwit their opponents the American sub the WWI-vintage S-33 has been disguised as a Nazi craft and a German-speaking Yank officer will lead the boarding party and try to keep the ruse going long enough for his small unit to overtake the stranded U-boat. Its a perfectly good setup for a story of risk derring-do and heroism and one that features a couple of major reversals along the way that place the Americans in ever-greater jeopardy; as an underwater rollercoaster ride its been outfitted with as many twists and sudden free falls as its cunning craftsmen could devise. But there is scarcely a moment of downtime and perhaps one brief dialogue scene devoted to anything other than procedural matters. In this context it hardly matters who the characters are so long as they collectively possess a varied set of traits that manage to coalesce into a unit with a winning combination. At the storys fore is Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) a sullen fellow with his nose out of joint over not having been given command of his own boat. Instead he must serve Lt. Commander Mike Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) and also do the bidding of Marine Maj. Coonan (David Keith) who joins the expedition with a load of explosives. Among the other faces that stick out of the crowd are those of WWI vet Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel) communications expert Lt. Peter Emmett (Jon Bon Jovi) the German-fluent Lt. Hirsch (Jake Weber) radioman Wentz (Jack Noseworthy) and black cook Eddie (T.C. Carson). Films big early scene and the plots pivot comes in the driving rain at night as the American sailors attempt to board the Nazi sub from two inflatable rafts. Given the dark and torrential conditions it is understandably hard to make out all the action during this major set piece but this is still no excuse for not clearly showing what happens to two important characters Keiths domineering Marine Major suddenly disappears never to be seen again while Paxtons commander can be glimpsed in the water signaling for Tyler to forget about him and take off although how and when he was injured remains obscure. But this is only the beginning of the irritants. This is one of those movies very much of the old school in which the bad guys aim is always off but the good guys invariably hit the target however difficult with a single shot. Especially in the final climax with the U-571 locked in mortal combat with a Nazi destroyer the Germans fire off countless salvos that just barely miss the heroes while the latter make implausibly lucky hits on more than one critical occasion. The Americans seem to survive more close calls than Indiana Jones did in all of his adventures rolled together and this is meant to be a basically realistic picture They figure out how to operate a German submarine within minutes eliminate the attacking U-boat with dispatch knock out the destroyers radio tower elude countless depth charges and torpedoes and fix pesky electrical problems and water leaks on their way to the final showdown with the destroyer. In the sequence that most directly mimics one in ""Das Boot"" the U-571 dives to 200 meters far below the maximum allowable depth. Mostows staging is competent but the level of danger and tension never comes close to what Petersen generated partly due to the far lesser degree of claustrophobic containment the new film achieves and partly because of its more artificial and concocted nature. Even though there are deaths and sacrifices along the way ""U- 571"" is fundamentally a story of anonymous men rising to the occasion with none of the complex components of irony doom and a genuinely tragic hero overlaid upon the accomplishment of the job at hand that made ""Das Boot"" such a rich experience. Tyler is the only figure endowed with what could remotely be termed a character arc moving from begrudging obedience to uncertainty and finally to forceful unhesitant action. All of McConaugheys usual tics and mannerisms have been drained away here leaving nothing but determination -- both on the part of the character and the actor -- to do a good job. Given more to work with Keitel could have made something of his old salt character but virtually all the dialogue like the movie itself is unpoetically functional leaving the actors with little to do other than react to events as they rapidly unfold. The moral bankruptcy of the Nazis is underlined in an early scene in which they are shown mowing down a lifeboat full of sailors on the high seas rather than taking them prisoner and the filmmakers get in a contempo dig at the then-heavily segregated U.S. armed forces by having the black cook survive and demonstrate that he can quickly master any technical job hes assigned. Shot in Malta and at Cinecitta Studios in Rome pic boasts fine production values and effects save for a couple of too-obviously digital explosions. Richard Marvins score is far too insistent and full of martial-music cliches.

Here as in his previous film the Kurt Russell highway paranoia thriller ""Breakdown"" (1997) Mostow working with his screenwriting partner Sam Montgomery (as well as David Ayer) takes characters and situations that are if anything overly familiar and charges them with fresh volts of dramatic surprise. Watching ""U-571"" you can always sense where the action is headed but youre never sure just how its going to get there. The movie wastes no time letting us know that its willing to kill off key characters to leave our heroes in a lurch and then dig them in deeper and deeper still. Mostow its clear was heavily influenced by the leaky-rivet nuts-and-bolts existential physicality of ""Das Boot"" (1982) Wolfgang Petersens celebrated German U-boat thriller perhaps the first World War II movie realistic enough to imagine a submarine as a giant yet claustrophobic sardine can. Like ""Das Boot"" ""U-571"" depicts underwater warriors as cocooned and vulnerable sleuthing through the sea with only an eggshell of tin to separate themselves from death. This however is the rollicking American version. The setting may be ""serious"" and scrupulous in its historical detail but the filmmaking is strictly for kicks - we might be watching ""Dying Hard to Save Private Ryan."" Mostow is a junkie for narrative and ""U-571"" has been designed to leap from one suspense gambit to the next (a stowaway enemy sailor a battery that dies at just the wrong moment). The movie is filled with grandly ominous images of sinking ships zooming surveillance planes and torpedoes that propel their way through the water like skinny metal sharks. When the submarine has to dive 400 meters beneath the surface to avoid detection you can practically feel the water pressure crushing in on the sailors. Theres an element of dread-soaked comedy - and it must be said of unabashed gimmickry - to the directors orchestrated high-risk sweepstakes. Still Mostow like Howard Hawks has a knack for using action to reveal his characters inner moxie. Most of the performers in ""U-571"" have been cast subtly against type an effect thats only enhanced by the severity of their military haircuts and were held in scene after scene by the emotion in their faces the husky authority of David Keith the surprising tremulousness of Jon Bon Jovi (completely unrecognizable without his rock-dandy mane) the prickliness of Harvey Keitel and the tersely woeful heroism of Matthew McConaughey. The entire movie is structured as a test of Lieutenant Tylers (McConaughey) leadership - does he have the mettle to take charge? - but by the end were really watching McConaughey finally earn his stripes as a star. Hes a face of stoic courage amid the movies sound and fury.
