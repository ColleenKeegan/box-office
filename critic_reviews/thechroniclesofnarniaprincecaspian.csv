Comments The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian Disney and Walden Media adapt another of C.S. Lewiss classic fantasy novels though this fusty sequel lacks the narrative complexity of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) and squanders both its first-rate computer graphics and its sturdy international cast. The four Pevensie children (William Moseley Anna Popplewell Skandar Keynes Georgie Henley) return to the magical realm of Narnia where an evil lord (Sergio Castellitto in a glowering one-note performance) covets the throne of his nephew Caspian (Ben Barnes). Tilda Swinton returns for a brief cameo as the White Witch Peter Dinklage has a comparably small role and under Andrew Adamsons middling direction most of the battle scenes are pedestrian.

"Review A glowing Prince Caspian - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review A glowing Prince CaspianStory Highlights CNN.coms Tom Charity ""Prince Caspian"" moves the Narnia series forward Films heart is in two major battle sequences If there are struggles its with the C.S. Lewis source material Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- ""You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember"" the dwarf Trumpkin cautions the Pevensie children -- Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy -- on their return visit to the magical land theyd visited in ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe."" Ben Barnes plays the title character in ""Prince Caspian."" Fair warning. ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" is indeed a darker and more violent episode than ""Wardrobe"" the first film in the series based on the C.S. Lewis novels. It is a year later -- in the Pevensies time. In Narnia centuries have passed. The castle at Cair Paravel lies in ruins. The trees no longer dance the bears dont talk and the Old Narnians hide out in the woods praying that one day they will recover their land from the godless tyrannical Telmarines. Lewis book was one of the weaker entries in the series. But the movie is a marked improvement on the novel and an altogether more robust confident enterprise than director Andrew Adamsons previous effort. Even so it cant entirely dispel the aura of Tolkien-in-short-trousers that permeates Narnia along with that quaint English sense of sovereign entitlement the blithe conviction that paradise could be reclaimed if only everyone understood the rules of cricket. At any moment you half expect someone to call a break for tea and crumpets. Thats part of Narnias charm of course but also a real challenge for filmmakers addressing a very different audience than the readership Lewis had in mind. iReport.com What did you think of ""Prince Caspian?"" So the film includes two lengthy battle sequences to spice things up. The first is an invention of Adamson and his writing partners Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely (""You Kill Me"") the second a significant elaboration on a mere two pages in the book. They both provide some welcome energy to the film. Dont Miss iReport.com What summer movies are you looking forward to? Caspian himself enjoys a more advanced role. Played by 26-year-old British newcomer Ben Barnes as a kind of Mediterranean pretty-boy Hamlet the prince escapes a plot by his uncle King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) -- who has usurped his throne -- and falls in with a rag-tag band of talking badgers valiant mice dwarves minotaurs griffins and centaurs. With the return of the four Kings and Queens of yore Caspian cedes leadership to ""Peter the Magnificent."" But pride and tension ensure that a pre-emptive strike on the Telmarine court is a fiasco. (""Peter the Impetuous"" might be a more fitting moniker.) None of this is in Lewis but the thwarted assault is the most exciting set piece in the picture and would not look out of place beside Peter Jacksons work in ""Lord of the Rings."" The bloodshed might have been averted if only the boys had listened to faithful little Lucy (Georgie Henley) the youngest and the purest of Aslans disciples (and also the pick of the child stars). In this mythology the shorter you are the nobler youre likely to prove. And the more enjoyable you are in the film. Case in point The two most colorful scene-stealers are Reepicheep a swashbuckling mouse (voiced with gusto by Eddie Izzard) and Peter Dinklages grumpy Trumpkin patronizingly nicknamed ""Dear Little Friend"" by the Pevensies or ""DLF"" for short. Live-action and digital effects are state of the art -- theres a nice detail when a distracted centaur kid is pulled up to attention by his mom -- although at one point during the climactic battle Caspians strategy seems to involve bringing the roof down on the heads of his own cavalry. (Not a tactic they teach at West Point.) A few minutes later were treated to the sorry spectacle of bullish minotaurs in retreat the pathos all the greater because theyre so obviously grown men in costume. But these are minor distractions. ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" may lack the visual distinction of the great fantasy film series such as ""Rings"" but at least ""Prince Caspian"" is a step in the right direction. Adamson barrels the action along in an even-handed manner that should keep most of the family happy. And the film sets a fair wind for ""The Voyage of the Dawn Treader"" coming to a theater near you in 2010. ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" is rated PG and runs 140 minutes.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Perfect Disharmony A superbly tangled film about Turkey and Germanys divided souls. By David Edelstein Published May 18 2008 ShareThis (Photo Yasamin Kiyisinda/courtesy of Strand Releasing) In the first section of Fatih Akins entrancing The Edge of Heaven a coffin bearing a Turkish woman murdered in Germany is unloaded from a plane in Turkey; in the second section a coffin bearing a German woman murdered in Turkey is unloaded from a plane in Germany. The killings are linked in a roundabout way but the mourners never grasp the pattern. The movie is like a Dickens novel with the ends of all the subplots lopped off The related characters (six of them) who improbably stray across one anothers paths cant see the connections and the harmonious resolutions youre expecting dont arrive. Frustrating And yet those frustrations pay off. The Edge of Heaven is powerfully unsettledit comes together by not coming together. Dislocation and disharmony are Akins themes. The director was born in Germany in 1973 of Turkish parents and he remains a divided soul raised in one country but with roots in another. His harsh moody films (his last was the punk romance Head-On) are mixed-up dialogues between cultures that are themselves mixed-up often violently. The movies like the characters have no center. Or maybe their center is a void. Identities disappear into it. No one in The Edge of Heaven is on home turf but no one escapes his or her legacy certainly not the middle-aged Turkish prostitute Yeter (Nursel Kose) in the films first chapter Yeters Death. She has no illusions no expectations. She works on an open-air sex strip in Bremena permissive environment until a couple of Turkish Muslims let her know theyll kill her if she doesnt close up shop. Its the worst of both worlds Shes isolated in a foreign land but bound by the restrictions of the old one. So she accepts the offer of a client a lonely old Turkish widower (Tuncel Turkiz) to live with him and give him her favors exclusively; although he has a George Burns twinkle hes a drunk who regards her as his property. Before the old mans assimilated son Nejat (Baki Davrak) can intervene the film makes good on the chapters title. Akin is big on symmetry. Nejat is a professor of German and when he travels in his guilt to Turkey to track down Yeters estranged daughter Ayten (Nurgul Yesilcay) he ends up switching places with the owner of a German bookstore who wants to return to Deutschland. The daughter meanwhile heads to Germany to find her mother; shes a radical lefty activist on the lam. In the films second section Lottes Death she meets a shining-eyed idealistic student Lotte and they fall deeply hungrily in love. Some good lesbian tongue action is undercut by Lottes mother Hanna Schygulla who looks on her daugthers lover with mute disapproval. The narrative is too twisty to summarize yet Akins storytelling is masterly. He passes the point of view effortlessly among his protagonists. He alternates intimate close-ups and cool long shots; he brings you close to characters before he kills them off. He created Lottes mother Susanne for Schygulla and even if you dont know Schygullas history if you never saw her in Rainer Werner Fassbinders transgressive parables you can feel something radioactive in her presence. Shes not demonic shes terrifiedby her daughters sexuality by Aytens angry anti-colonialist rhetoric. Turkey will soon be in the European Union she protests. Best not to fight but to wait. The Fassbinder mascot has aged into a Good German. Akins Germany and Turkey seem like inversions of each other the Germans outwardly liberal but tight repressed with a lurking reactionary strain the Turks corrupt and repressive but with a passionate fullness. Despite similar views of each culture The Edge of Heaven feels nothing like Head-On which is a rough bloody screwball tragedy in which the hero and heroine meet cute in a mental hospital after their respective suicide attempts. The new film is even and controlled and in places it seems as if Akin was straitjacketed by his immaculate construction. Despite his inner tug-of-war Nejatprobably a stand-in for the directoris disappointingly undemonstrative. (And why is he so sexless?) The reason for the Turkish mother and daughters estrangement is unclear. Aytens politics? Theres a moment when Nejat and the ghost of Yeter pass Ayten and Lotte that feels as if it belongs in another movieits moth-eaten magical realism. The actors keep the movie raw and alive especially Ziolkowska with her charming headlong ardor and Schygulla with her wails of grief that seem dredged up from a bottomless chasmnot from hell but endless purgatory. The movie might be overly determined but Akins feelings arent. Hes trying to work out something he doesnt entirely understand dredging up pieces of his psyche and arranging them into ever-more-complicated patterns. In The Edge of Heaven he finds a place for rage for melancholy resignation and even in the end for hope. The void isnt filled but it isnt unfillable. 1 2 Next Share this story...

In the sequel ""Prince Caspian"" their gateway is a subway. As the four Pevensie children stand waiting at a station in Londons Underground a train comes roaring through at warp speed theyre whooshed out of the tunnel and deposited on a sunstruck beach in Narnia where 1300 years have passed since their last visit. The transition is thrilling in a film thats short on thrills though long on clanging swords conventional battles and spectacular scenery. See a clip from the new ""Prince Caspian"" movie. I wish I could be more enthusiastic about ""Prince Caspian"" an honorable and attractive adventure for children and families. But scenic beauty and spirited action cant conceal its dramatic defects -- the novel wasnt the strongest in the C.S. Lewis series -- or tighten the slack in Andrew Adamsons direction of his live actors. As before the talking animals deliver dare I say it the lions share of the fun. (Although Aslan the leonine Christ surrogate in Lewiss allegory makes only a brief appearance Reepicheep a fearless mouse voiced by Eddie Izzard is consistently appealing.) ENLARGE The prince of the title forced into exile by an evil uncle is played by the young English actor Ben Barnes. Caspians allure is quickly apparent but slow to develop since hes essentially passive for much of the films 144-minute running time and the romantic attraction between him and Anna Popplewells Susan is tacit to the vanishing point until the very end. Similarly the reappearance of Tilda Swintons White Witch promises to be more than the brief icebreaker that it is. But ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" finds its footing as an old-fashioned action adventure when the Prince and the Pevensies (Narnian royalty in their own right) lead an army of liberation to return Narnia to the Narnians. And the notion of heroic stature is redefined by Peter Dinklages portrayal of the indomitable dwarf warrior Trumpkin. If it isnt a towering performance its certainly a powerful one. Reprise Film Clips See clips of the films ""Reprise"" and ""Roman de Gare."" A gesture like a picture can say much more than words. In ""Reprise"" a remarkable debut feature from Norway an editor chats with a promising young novelist whose first book is about to be published. ""How old are you 23?"" the editor asks. ""Yes"" replies the writer Erik whos as handsome as he is bright. ""Fantastic"" the editor says with a smile. Then crossing his hands in front of his chest he opens them upward and outward in a fleeting gesture of wonderment and heartfelt salute as if to say ""Its perfect this moment of your life youre young and youve got it all."" Being young in the tumultuous here and now is what ""Reprise"" is about. Joachim Triers coming-of-age film which he co-wrote with Eskil Vogt moves to the rhythms of punk lyrical poetry comedy and tragedy often within the same passage. (My Norwegian is lacking but the English subtitles seem excellent.) The narrative structure is equally fluid a collage of ruminations and cockeyed speculations -- the sort of what-if visions of the future that boil around in young brains -- within a perfectly lucid story of Erik whos played by Espen Klouman-Hoiner and his friend Phillip shooting the rapids of love adulthood and the literary life. (The film begins with the two of them dropping their manuscripts into a mailbox.) ENLARGE Pal Stokka Espen Klouman Hoiner Anders Danielsen Lie and Viktoria Winge in Reprise. Success comes first to Phillip. Hes the charismatic one though also the unstable one and the actor who plays him Anders Danielsen Lie gives a performance thats as distinctive as any in recent memory -- casually witty remarkably graceful and yet terrifying in its explosiveness. (Mr. Lie we are told was a child actor but hes also a musician and a physician. No one ever said the distribution of talent was fair.) At times the film seems to be about everything at once -- parties friendships rivalries fear of women fragments of childhood memories -- but the core has to do with Phillips obsessive relationship with his girlfriend Kari (yet another stunning performance by Viktoria Winge) and his fateful attempt to reprise in painstaking detail a vacation spent in Paris when they were in love. The conventional -- and unfortunately correct -- wisdom about independent films is that theyre an endangered species what with entertainment conglomerates dominating the marketplace and their products all but monopolizing the multiplexes. Youd never know that though from ""Reprise."" Its a fine film by any standard on any scale. Roman de Gare As I started my review of Claude Lelouchs ""Roman de Gare"" my first impulse was to say that I couldnt guess how many times Ive complained about movies being manipulative. Then I realized I didnt have to guess. Using Factiva as my search engine and ""Morgenstern and manipulative"" as my search terms I found 30 examples in the blink of an eye. Not too terribly repetitive for a gig that began 13 years ago this month but the point this time is to commend not condemn a new film that wears its manipulativeness as a badge of honor. Nothing is what it seems or claims to be in this thriller by Mr. Lelouch whose ""A Man and a Woman"" won an Oscar four decades ago. If youre willing to go along with it as I was then being manipulated -- or at least actively misled -- becomes a pleasure. ENLARGE Dominique Pinon and Audrey Dana in Roman de Gare. Audrey Dana a new actress and an impressive one is Huguette a young woman with a Savoie accent whos just been dumped by her fiance. Dominique Pinon plays a sleight-of-hand artist with a nervous sniffle who gives her a lift; hes either an escaped serial killer or as he claims to be ""a famous novelists ghost writer who is ending seven years of slavery."" Fanny Ardant is the novelist trapped in a plot of her own making. As for the movies plot think of red herrings swimming strongly upstream. ENLARGE Morgensterns DVD TIP Dominique Pinon is best known for playing the ex-clown in ""Delicatessen"" (1991) and the clones in ""The City of Lost Children"" (1995) but he first made his mark as a creepy thug in ""Diva"" (1981) an inimitably cool and stylish thriller directed by Jean-Jacques Beineix. Wilhelmenia Fernandez is Cynthia Hawkins the opera singer who has never allowed herself to be recorded and Frederic Andrei is Jules an ardent motorbike messenger who gets into all sorts of trouble after recording her.

The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian (PG) Disney (140 min.) Directed by Andrew Adamson. With Ben Barnes Peter Dinklage William Moseley Anna Popplewell. Now playing in New Jersey. THREE AND A HALF STARS Centaurs and minotaurs giants and werewolves four quarreling English children and an enormous lion to lead them all into battle -- yes looks like were back in Narnia again. And thank goodness. The thanks are due because of the magical appeal and adventure of these tales. They are more than half-a-century after C.S. Lewis wrote them still literally charming -- able to conjure up a world of myth and fantasy. And the goodness -- thats here in abundance too. Because without any lecturing or too much obvious allegory they remain stories about faith hope charity and the redemptive power of self-sacrifice. But with really wonderful swordfights and talking animals. The second in a proposed series of seven this film takes place after ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" left off. After having slipped into an enchanted world met the leonine Aslan defeated the White Witch and ruled as kings and queens Peter Edmund Susan and Lucy are back in wartime England. And frankly finding being a schoolchild again rather tiresome. What they dont know however is that Narnia has been reconquered. And Prince Caspian is about to use an important bit of magic they left behind to call them back to the enchanted kingdom join his army of fabulous creatures and talking mice and help him drive out a tyrant and regain his throne. Director and co-screenwriter Andrew Adamson faced a challenge here and its clear even to -- perhaps especially to -- anyone who loved these classic stories ""Prince Caspian"" is the weakest of the series as first the children have to be convinced theyre in Narnia then Caspian has to be convinced hes in danger. There are the first hints of the books slight xenophobia and when the battle finally comes its hasty and unsatisfying. Adamson must know that -- hes a lifelong fan of the books -- and his changes are smart and effective. He begins with Caspian and speeds up the action; hes added a storming-the-castle sequence and a few lovely touches not in the books (such as the giant eagles that carry the children to battle). The final battle is extended and King Miraz -- a barely glimpsed swarthy stereotype in the novel -- becomes clearer and more threatening. The young actors from the first film are all back and refreshingly real -- although William Moseley the oldest boy is appropriately heroic and Anna Popplewell the oldest girl has lovely eyes none of them are treacly cute. Ben Barnes makes a good Prince Caspian -- theres a bit of Inigo Montoya in that flashing anger -- and Peter Dinklage is a properly brave and gruff Trumpkin. The scenery -- mostly New Zealand -- is gorgeous and for a change the battle scenes give a sense of tactics. Some tactical changes arent quite as effective. There are so many characters that Adamson lets some go forgotten for too long; a mild flirtation between Susan and Caspian feels like a sop to the tween audience (although not nearly as egregious as the rubbishy pop song that concludes the film). And a climactic battle -- not in the book -- has too much of ""The Ten Commandments"" in it as well as some uncharacteristically subpar CGI. But these are small failings and certainly Aslan would forgive them. Whats important here is that Narnia -- and its fascinating all-ages mix of pagan myth and Christian symbolism of boys-own-adventures and Round Table heroics -- is back. And although only the very young and innocent are allowed to go there in the novels even the old and jaded are able to visit it in the movies as often as we like -- even best of all perhaps with a wondering child or two in tow. Rating note The film contains swords sorcery and a few monsters too scary for the very young. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Another classic saga of deeds dastardly and swashes buckled ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" doesnt quite equal the first film but some may find this one a less-insistent piece of pure entertainment because it isnt so overtly Christian. (A disclaimer Im on friendly terms with this films producer Mark Johnson who also produced the TV series based on my novel ""Love Monkey."") ""Narnia 2"" has a bleak ""Empire Strikes Back""-ish aura with leaders making poor decisions that cause heavy losses rebels in hiding and a psychological wrestling match inside a Jungian cave. In place of jolly Mr. Tumnus from the first film the guide this time is a dour red-bearded dwarf (Peter Dinklage) who warns ""You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember."" Cuteness is tightly rationed with only a feisty sword-fighting mouse on hand to provide much in the way of comic relief. The four kids from the first movie are now fully licensed kings and queens of Narnia. But they are still stuck in wartime London trudging around a train station in their school uniforms. Any hopes that theyll be getting in a rumble with the Hogwarts gang are dashed though when the station abruptly turns into Narnia where they discover 1300 years have passed while they were away for one year in earth time.Things are not well The lion king Aslan is nowhere in sight his good works lie in ruins and all of the magical creatures he once championed have been driven into near-extinction by the ruling tribe of vicious humans called the Telmarines. They speak in Italian accents and rock a conquistador look to produce an amusing anti-Mediterranean effect.With the king of the Telmarines dead his brother takes over. The new despot who will soon crown himself King Miraz orders a hit squad to take out his nephew the proper heir to the throne Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes of ""The History Boys""). Instead Caspian escapes chased by troops who hadnt reckoned on the battle readiness of for instance a resourceful badger and a rapier-wielding mouse. When he joins forces with the four kids there arises a dilemma Should they hunker down and set a trap for their attackers or launch a daring aerial raid on the enemy castle? And what should they make of young Lucys claim that Aslan is around somewhere?The themes lack the heft of the first movie - theres nothing here with the mythic force of Aslans Christ-like death and rebirth or of young Edmunds character gradually subsiding into evil. (A cave battle with inner demons is brief and seemingly tossed in.) Theres also a villain deficit The wicked king is a retro figure a nefarious Italian who could have been played by Basil Rathbone or Claude Rains. He has neither the supernatural pull nor the fashion panache of the unnerving White Witch.But ""Narnia 2"" is as splendid a military movie as ""Patton."" The C.S. Lewis book on which it is based is said to have been inspired by Mars the god of war. Director Andrew Adamson brilliantly assembles the battle scenes complicating the action with the medieval equivalents of tank traps and airborne assaults behind enemy lines. Adamson also has the confidence to know when to slow things down to savor the majesty of a gauzy vision of Aslan in the forest or the pride of the four siblings marching beneath the upraised swords of their honor guard. Its the kind of movie where no one has to be hip or apologize for language like ""Stay your blade."" In their refusal to be up-to-the-moment the Narnia movies are bound to age beautifully perhaps much more so than the two Shrek films Adamson directed. When he stages a display of fireworks over a castle it isnt a smarmy allusion meant to get a laugh but a pleasing reminder of the Disney canon in which this film takes its rightful place.

Fantasy-adventure about siblings who help save a magical land. With William Moseley Ben Barnes. Director Andrew Adamson (224). PG Intense battle action and violence. At area theaters. ""Things never happen the same way twice"" the noble lion Aslan teaches us in ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian."" And anyone familiar with author C.S. Lewis classic fantasy series knows that Aslan creator and savior of Narnia is never wrong.So those coming to the second installment in Andrew Adamsons epic adaptation are likely to be disappointed if they arrive with memories of the first truly wondrous adventure. But taken on its own theres still enough magic in this sequel to please all but the most earth-bound audience members. When the movie begins the young Pevensie siblings from ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" - Peter (William Moseley) Susan (Anna Popplewell) Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) - are once again stuck in dreary wartime England. Soon enough however they return to a Narnia that desperately needs them. The kingdoms new leader should be Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) but his wicked uncle Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) has stolen the crown and started a civil war. With little time to waste Caspian and Peter marshal their army which in this case includes centaurs minotaurs a cranky dwarf (Peter Dinklage) and a very brave mouse (voiced by Eddie Izzard). Peter and Caspian have differing ideas on how to fight Mirazs men but only Lucy knows they cannot win by force alone. Without faith and the aid of Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) they will surely be lost. Lewis made no secret of the religious themes in his stories and theyre certainly evident on-screen if you go looking. Most viewers wont though because theres always so much else to see. Adamson stages breathtaking battles intense enough to rival those from ""The Lord of the Rings"" while the actors playing the Pevensies are as charming as ever. The same alas cannot be said for the wooden Barnes and there is no villain to rival ""Wardrobes"" White Witch (played again by Tilda Swinton in a brief cameo). With his generic threats and random Italian accent Miraz isnt half as scary as those computer-generated minotaurs. Still even with all the CGI effects this darkly emotional movie feels like the anti-""Speed Racer."" Sure its a big-budget spectacle. But its also the kind of grandly old-fashioned entertainment we dont get enough of anymore. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

""Oh youve got to be kidding"" he says his delivery oozing dashed expectations. ""Youre it? The kings and queens of old?"" And because Trumpkin is played by Peter Dinklage a diminutive actor with a huge withering presence the young people facing him are rendered temporarily mute. It doesnt last. But its a fun moment and it provides some brief comic relief to a movie otherwise notable for its mortally serious tone. This Prince Caspian (actually based on the fourth book in C.S. Lewiss series) is one dour film -- disconsolate rebellious and violent lightened by brilliant visual invention and touches of flighty wit. Dinklage as Trumpkin and Eddie Izzard as the voice of Reepicheep a stout-hearted mouse with a dArtagnan feather steal every scene theyre in. Karl Walter Lindenlaubs cinematography shimmers like the dawn. And when ancient trees uproot and thunder across the battlefield? Wow. But its a dark place we enter when we journey to Narnia this time. The Pevensie children have aged a year (supposedly; the actors are all three years older and look it) since their return to wartime London at the close of 2005s The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe but more than a millennium has passed in their magical alter-world. Time has not been kind After the Pevensie four departed Narnia was invaded and Old Narnians were all but wiped out by invading forces of human Telmarines. These Telmarines depicted as glowering Conquistadores have been ruled by a string of Caspians. The latest is the young Prince of the title (Ben Barnes) whos forced to flee into the woods of Narnia by his power-hungry and possibly murderous uncle Lord Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). On the verge of capture Caspian blows an enchanted horn that summons those kings and queens of old Peter (William Moseley) Edmund (Skandar Keynes) Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Lucy (Georgie Henley). The four return to Cair Paravel finding it in ruins. Perplexed they unearth their stash of royal clothing and various magical tchotchkes (Susans bow and arrows; Lucys elixir) and promptly head out in search of answers. So they meet Trumpkin and eventually Caspian thereafter spending the plot in pitched military conflict against the wicked Miraz. The result is absolutely magnificent eye candy. All that we have come to expect from a fantasy saga is here talking animals (badgers and mice); mythic creatures (centaurs and minotaurs); vast clanging battle scenes engaged by muscled armies. I love the shhhhing of a broadsword pulled from its scabbard and I admire the way Adamson shot the film with maximum warfare but minimal blood cutting away split seconds before death or dismemberment. This is a PG affair after all. No on-screen decapitations allowed. But to those who love it whove read the books and feel theyve lived there the world of Narnia should offer more than eye candy. There are indeed battles and bloodshed and chivalry in Lewiss imagining but theyre less important than the archetypal moral struggles that underpin them all -- between good and evil resolve and temptation the cold allure of the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and the ""deep magic"" of Aslan the Lion (Liam Neeson). These struggles remain but Adamson (and co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely) have tweaked the plot rejiggered the character dynamics and piled on the epic warfare. By the end I had overdosed on surly Peter pouty Caspian and over-digitized shock-and-awe. In a dream Lucy visits with Aslan in the midst of a sparkling forest. She asks him why he hasnt shown up to help and he replies ""Things never happen the same way twice dear one."" Hes right.

"Narnia misses magic mark | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsNarnia misses magic mark Its been 1300 years since the four Pevensie children last reigned in Narnia in the first instalment of the 2005 movie version of C. S. Lewiss The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.The art of storytelling gets lost amid noisy battles and CGI trickery in The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian starring Ben Barnes above.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. May 16 2008 The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian (out of 4)Starring Ben Barnes Georgie Henley Skandar Keynes William Moseley Anna Popplewell Sergio Castellitto and Peter Dinklage. Directed by Andrew Adamson. 144 minutes. At major theatres. PG Its been 1300 years since the four Pevensie children last reigned in Narnia in the first instalment of the 2005 movie version of C. S. Lewiss The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.Back in their native United Kingdom it seems like yesterday. World War II still rages just as it did when the children first discovered Narnia and the Pevensie quartet are still not past the first blush of youth. But in their absence dark days have befallen Narnia. Necessity calls in the form of a magical horn blown by the beleaguered Prince Caspian and before the Pevensies can board a train in the London underground theyre back in their old kingdom.While 1300 years is a long time not much has changed. Military technology has progressed from the early to the late Middle Ages with the introduction of crossbows conquistador-like helmets and marching in formation. The Telmarine invaders have conducted ethnic cleansing sending the Narnians into their forest stronghold.Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) rightful king of the Telmarines is driven into this forest by his usurping uncle King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). Here he meets the Narnians and Lucy Pevensie (Georgie Henley) Edmund (Skandar Keynes) Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell). A bargain is struck. Under the royal leadership of the Pevensies - Peter in particular - the Narnians will fight for their freedom and for Caspians right to the throne. This sequel marks the reunion of Andrew Adamson who directed the first Narnia venture and the actors who played the Pevensies in that movie - plus a brief appearance by Tilda Swinton as the evil Ice Queen and Liam Neeson as the voice of the lion Aslan.In the first Narnia movie Aslan was clearly a Christ figure enduring a sacrificial death and then rising from the tomb as it were. Here his theological implications are muted. The biggest connection of Aslan to divinity consists in the arguments of the characters over whether he exists. Also the ways of Aslan are mysterious and not our ways. ""Why havent you come to help us?"" cries Lucy who in the strength of her faith is the first to see Aslan. ""Things never happen the same way twice dear one"" Aslan replies.Meanwhile the Narnians who all speak in English accents and the Telmarines with their dark features conquistador helmets and vaguely continental accents are busily engaged in a thinly disguised re-enactment of the Spanish Armada.Quite a stirring fight it is. But it goes on forever absorbing a major portion of this rather long (almost 2 1/2-hour) movie. Swords clash with swords. Bodies fly through the air. CGI-created centaurs gallop hither and yon. Peter keeps sitting on a horse and yelling ""Charge"" The scriptwriters have tried to lighten the atmosphere with moments of banter and also the introduction of Lewiss secondary characters who all possess supposedly endearing traits - a curmudgeonly Narnian dwarf named Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) a chivalrous mouse named Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard) a wise professor named Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass).With an inspired screenplay these characters could have taken on life but theres a perfunctory quality about them.Not that its all mindless. Themes of humility and gratitude are acted out and at various points in the movie ""thanks"" becomes the magic word.But something human is missing here amidst all the centaurs and talking bears and mobile trees. Its the art of storytelling which knows when to allow characters time for heartfelt interaction when to build suspense when to mount a climax.In this movie enemy soldiers are always jumping out of the woodwork the stirring musical score never stops the special effects pound away. Its like a symphony consisting of nothing but booming crescendos. This resolute refusal to recognize that less is more is a common failing of fantasy pictures a failing abetting by the wonderful new technology that can do anything on the screen. But what does it profit a filmmaker to gain CGI and lose his narrative sense?

And ""welcome"" is the word. Like the finest fantasy epics ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" invites us into a rich realm and at two-plus hours holds us there for a goodly spell. With better meshing of the real and the computer-generated Narnia is an even more beguiling land than it was in 2005 when the long-awaited onscreen version of C.S. Lewis series ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" roared into theaters. But digital bells and whistles alone (no ""Speed Racer"" no) couldnt make a satisfying impression if there werent a tale pulling us deeper into the forests of Lewis imagination. ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" wastes no time introducing us to the beleaguered royal. British stage actor Ben Barnes plays the handsome if not-quite-formed Caspian. His uncle King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) and aunt have had a baby a son. In the bloody tradition of royal lineages everywhere this doesnt bode well for the rightful heir. Meanwhile in the Blitz-wary London of the 1940s the Pevensie siblings -- Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy -- are no longer kings and queens but once again schoolchildren. What a funk that must engender. In one universe a botched hit crossbow style has the dark-haired Caspian on the run -- a silvery nighttime chase across awesome wilderness. On an Underground platform stand the Pevensie youngsters. Caspian carries a horn his tutor gave him for a future dire moment. That moment comes quickly. He blows and summons the former rulers of Narnia. ""It feels like magic"" Lucy says as an uncanny wind whips. And indeed it does. Since early in cinemas history the motion of the train has stood in for frame-by-faster-frame magic of the movies. Soon the tiles of the station are giving way to the beauty of Narnia (played by an awesome New Zealand). Its not the place they left but a site of ruins and political repression 1300 years later. ""Prince Caspian"" has many a beguiling and subtle moment the sweet sight of sisters and brothers taking each others hands; the flick of a lions tail in kindly pleasure. Ditto the dialogue penned by the director and Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely any nudging of a PG rating doesnt happen in winking repartee. Some tart delivery comes from Trumpkin the Red Dwarf (""The Station Agent"" knockout Peter Dink- lage) who begrudgingly curmudgeonly joins the Pevensies on their quest to fulfill prophesy and rally the Narnians against King Miraz and his Telmarine fighters. That the kids save Trumpkin hardly tempers his mildly ill-tempered pose. The Pevensies are a fantastic foursome. No wonder they move so effortlessly into the summer of superheroes. Their sibling chemistry the foundation of the first adventure feels even more true here. Seduced in the original by the White Witch (played with unsettling allure by Tilda Swinton) Skandar Keynes Edmund has grown into a humbler wiser child. Oldest sibling Peter (William Moseley) maintains his caretaking grace. But he reacts for good but also disastrous ends in his rivalry with Caspian. Like Hermione of another fabulist franchise the Pevensie girls exhibit a maturity beyond that of their male counterparts. Anna Popplewells Susan is the most lethal of warriors pulling red-fletched arrows from her quiver with nary a quiver and sending them spot-on. But it is Georgie Henleys wee believer Lucy who embodies the movies untainted awe -- and yes faith. Shes the first to spy the resplendent Aslan (Liam Neeson) whom Narnians have been awaiting. There is much death but little blood let in this PG-rated film. Yet the filmmakers dont shy away from the dark machinations of powermongers. Betrayals abound. The final battle sequences weave a duel waged between Peter and Miraz with grander clashes of Narnians and Telmarines. Its fairly awesome if long. But director Andrew Adamsons got a gift for the thing that matters most be it represented in blossoms buzzing and darting around Lucy or a talk between a majestic king and his beloveds.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor May 17 2008 Save for later Saved ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" takes place one year after the events in ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" the initial film in the series derived from the C.S. Lewis religio-fantasy series. In Narnian years however that one year represents about 1300. Fortunately watching this movie doesnt feel quite that long.Once more we are unceremoniously plopped into the world of the Pevensie siblings big brother Peter (William Moseley) and little brother Edmund (Skandar Keynes) big sister Susan (Anna Popplewell) and little Lucy (Georgie Henley). They find themselves transported via a World War II-era Tube station in Trafalgar Square to Narnia where last time out they dispatched the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) and were elevated to royalty. (The White One makes a brief cameo here but she is sorely missed.)The moral of this new movie seems to be You cant go home again - especially if you arrive 1300 years later. The new Narnia is a pale reflection of the old. The talking beasties and mythological creatures live precariously on the margins of the kingdom now ruled by the Telmarines a race of entirely dark-haired humans (no blondes need apply). Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? The Pevensie clan has been summoned to Narnia by Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) who fled the castle when it became clear his uncle Lord Miraz (Sergio Castellito) was out to off him. Miraz looks as if hed be equally at home starring in ""300."" Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian And where you may ask is the mighty lion Aslan? He hasnt been seen in a millennium at least not until Lucy claps eyes on him in the forest. For my money there is entirely too little of Aslan in ""Prince Caspian"" although as voiced by Liam Neeson he still sounds too high-mindedly dull. The point is Aslan looks great and in the new Narnia looks count for a lot.Speaking of which the actors playing the Pevensie children have grown up in the three years since the first film and this makes for a better drama. For one thing theyre better actors now able to register a wider range of emotions. There are also some welcome new additions including surly dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) - where would the mythological fantasy genre be without surly dwarfs? - and a talking mouse named Reepicheep (hilariously voiced by Eddie Izzard).The first ""Narnia"" movie was much discussed in terms of C.S. Lewiss Christian symbolism but the new film is unlikely to provoke such discussion. Much more so than its predecessor ""Prince Caspian"" is an action film - too much of an action film. As the battles pile up the lyrical atmosphere wafts away and what we get is a more standard recipe. Director Andrew Adamson who also made the first film was director of the two ""Shrek"" films and he still seems not altogether at home with live action. He cant quite work up a magical atmosphere - especially when the film is constantly being grounded by such leaden lines as ""The throne is rightfully mine.""Still this is a bigger and darker ""Narnia"" movie and although it didnt leave me famished for the inevitable sequel it delivers the family-entertainment goods. Memo to the producers Next time out more dwarfs more Aslan and definitely more Reepicheep. Grade B. (Rated PG for epic battle action and violence.)

The gallant Pevensie siblings recall the Harry Potter crew. And Reepicheep a swashbuckling mouse possesses a giant ego in inverse proportion to his tiny frame - just like Shreks rakish PussnBoots. Directed by Shreks Andrew Adamsonwho also made the one about The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian is an elaborately presented feast that will taste familiar to the tween and teen audience for whom it is served. The four courses are love war faith and humor served in no canonical order and sometimes simultaneously. Visually Adamson borrows heavily from the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter recipe books. Because Narnia author C.S. Lewis and LOTR scribe J.R.R. Tolkien were longtime friends and Oxford dons who wrote their allegories at roughly the same time (Lewis were published first) there are obvious commonalities. J.K. Rowling Harry Potters mother who uses initials instead of a first name like the dons who so deeply influenced her has acknowledged her debt to both. Still for Prince Caspians first half hour I wished that Adamson had framed his story so that it didnt look so derivative of LOTR Harry Potter and his own Shrek. As it goes along Adamsons longish film (137 minutes) overcomes an awkward start finding its own visual language and rhythms. In earth years it is 1941 a year after the Pevensies fell through the wardrobe into an enchanted parallel universe. While theyre standing in the London Underground in their school uniforms the sound of a rams horn beckons them to Narnia where 1300 years have elapsed since Aslan the lion king was sacrificed and resurrected. Thus the Pevensies go from the frying pan of the German blitz on London to the fire of battle between Narnians and King Miraz who effectively has deposed Prince Caspian (destined-to-be-next-tween heartthrob Ben Barnes) rightful heir to the throne. Where Lion Witch and Wardrobe was primarily an adventure movie this one is definitely a war movie. While the acting is a vast improvement over the first installment the supremely talented Sergio Castellito as King Miraz and the wryly funny Peter Dinklage (of The Station Agent) as Trumpkin the Red Dwarf steal the show so often they could be booked for felony. Eddie Izzard who supplies the voice of Reebicheep is their able co-conspirator. Despite postcard-lovely landscapes (shot variously in New Zealand Slovenia Poland and the Czech Republic) Adamsons film really comes to life when a menagerie of griffins and centaurs are loosed suggesting an invasion of Maurice Sendaks wild things. While the more mature actors and creatures and CGI effects tend to upstage the younger performers nothing could be sweeter than Georgie Henley as Lucy Pevensie the youngest sibling whose poise and pluck carry the day. The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian  (out of four stars) Directed by Andrew Adamson based on the book by C.S. Lewis. With Ben Barnes Georgie Henley William Moseley Anna Popplewell Skandar Keynes Peter Dinklage and Sergio Castellito. Distributed by Walt Disney Co. Running time 2 hours 17 mins.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The repeated catchphrase in ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" is rumbled by the majestic lion Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson). ""Things never happen the same way twice"" he proclaims and true enough the ambitious sequel to 2005s ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is bigger brasher more magical and funnier than the first. This film does a graceful job of straddling the gap between C.S. Lewis Christian-tinged fantasy and Peter Jacksons armor-rattling ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Theres a touch of ""Harry Potter"" in the mix too The Pevensie children -- Peter (William Moseley) Susan (Anna Popplewell) Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) -- take a magical tube ride from WWII-era London to the enchanted land where they lived as kings and queens. One earthly year has passed since they returned home from Narnia but 1300 have elapsed in the strange world that they re-enter. Their former castle lies in ruins. There is little magic in the kingdom save a few centaurs and talking animals. Aslan has not been seen for generations. The Narnians have been routed by the human Telmarines ruled by ruthless Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) who has usurped the throne of Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Director Andrew Adamson (""Shrek"" and the first ""Narnia"") must have been shouting ""More Faster Bigger"" through his bullhorn. The action scarcely flags as chases on horseback and broadsword duels pile upon catapult barrages and clashing armies. Hot-tempered Peter bristles at Caspians chastely romantic attentions to Susan who offers the classic brush-off ""It would never work. After all I am 1300 years older than you."" The supporting cast is deep with talent notably Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin a testy dwarf; a chivalrous sword-fighting mouse amusingly voiced by Eddie Izzard and a cavalry of noble centaurs. Tilda Swintons ice queen virtually steals the show in a brief chilling cameo. Oh those subzero eyes Handout Mct Peter Dinklage left and Warwick Davis co-star in Walt Disney Pictures The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian."" The sequels tone is darker than the first. ""You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember"" warns Trumpkin. The tyrannical Miraz exudes real menace and the battlefield action while antiseptically bloodless has a huge body count. The battles fought here arent the clear-cut good vs. evil of Aslan and the White Witch but a power struggle between human rivals. The Pevensie siblings are older wiser and a bit sadder than before though their reserves of English pluck are undiminished. Like the ""Potter"" and ""Rings"" stories this series appears to be growing more somber. With five ""Narnia"" books left to complete the set it should be an interesting journey to follow.

S. Lewis Chronicles of Narnia series share a highbrow imprimatur with box office juggernauts Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings that suggests they are higher-quality fare than most films for young audiences. For one thing they are adapted from books (and not just kids books but literature and even better British literature); they are live-action include gorgeous scenery and depict their young virtuous protagonists as serious intelligent beings who speak in refined locutions. Theres no swearing no bathroom humor. But underneath these genteel trappings the narratives of the films more closely resemble the sequential repetitive structure of videogames than a traditional plot arc. ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" the second installment in the series (following 2005s box office smash ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"") efficiently reintroduces the four Pevensie children sets in motion a struggle for control of Narnia and lets the combatants get down to the business of beating each other senseless in a series of escalating battles that constitute the meat of the movie. Theres a dull bombastic sameness to the last two-thirds of ""Prince Caspian"" as the characters progress from battle to battle like players ascending the levels of ""Donkey Kong.""The movie opens in Narnia which is now ruled by evil King Miraz leader of the Telmarines a race that banished the Narnians to the forest. When Mirazs wife gives birth to a son Mirazs nephew Prince Caspian who is the rightful heir to the throne must flee the castle. Meanwhile back in England our school-aged protagonists from the first film Peter Susan Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are sucked through a Harry Potter-esque time portal in the underground and deposited back in Narnia which has aged 1300 years since their last visit. Aslan the mythic lion who guided the Pevensie children during their first visit is nowhere to be found.This first part of the movie has a mournful lugubrious air; Lucy in particular cant get over how much Narnia has changed and she refuses to accept the loss of her beloved lion. Director Andrew Adamson conveys the childrens grief with atmospherically somber shots showing the scenery as both stunning and foreboding. In one scene Lucy wakes in a misty forest and wanders off in search of Aslan. Adamsons camera makes the trees seem to whisper the way--so much so that a special effect of swirling petals beckoning Lucy forward is clumsily excessive. When Lucy wakes to discover that her early morning walk was just a dream the light sharpens to reveal that shes back in reality--as real as Narnia can be that is. Its a nice subtle visual touch for a film that will soon be overwhelmed by computer-generated fakery. Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Soon enough the Pevensies meet up with Caspian and along with the Narnians pledge to help him claim the throne and free the Narnians from Telmarine rule. Newcomer Ben Barnes as Caspian seems cast to bring some Orlando Bloom-style heat to the story--and teenage girls to the theaters--but he plays Caspian as too hesitant to be an effective foil to Peters headstrong leadership. Like the Pevensie children Caspian is an orphan--he lost his father the king as a baby while the Pevensies have been separated from their mother by World War II. One message of the film is that adults whether ""sons of Adam"" like King Miraz or fantastical creatures like the White Witch (Tilda Swinton who makes a welcome cameo) are not to be trusted with the exception of Aslan the ultimate absentee father figure. But Caspian and the Pevensies never gel as an alternative family unit. The characters are often separated from each other left to fight their battles alone.As for those battles they are your standard CGI extravaganzas long loud and violent though with little actual blood. Adamson seems to prefer excess to invention so there are lots of shots of multitudes of armor-clad warriors racing down hillsides and Narnian minotaurs and centaurs galloping full speed into the breach. The more obvious special effects are downright hokey such as a weird swirling water creature who looks like something out of a toilet cleaner commercial. As the outcome of all the sword-flinging and catapult-launching is never in question its hard to stay engaged with the movie once the fighting begins. Filming for the next installment in the Narnia franchise is set to begin this fall and its a good bet the third film will be even more action-heavy and dramatically flat than ""Prince Caspian."" Its a shame because under all the gimmickry and effects theres a nice story to tell--as anyone who has read the books knows.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

The same people who made ""The Chronicles of Narnia The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" into one of the best films of 2005 have turned around and made one of this years biggest disappointments. The second installment of C.S. Lewis ""Narnia"" saga subtitled ""Prince Caspian"" is exactly one minute longer than its predecessor but its a dragged-out exercise with no epic scale and no spirit worth talking about. The filmmakers fall into the same trap that the makers of ""The Golden Compass"" did. They take a fantasy story and simplify it to the point that its just a war movie - about a war that never happened featuring a side that cant lose. The stakes arent particularly high either. Its not a battle between absolute evil versus absolute good. Rather its a battle between ruthless pragmatism versus ineffectual idealism. Ben Barnes who was so good in ""Stardust"" plays Prince Caspian the rightful king of Narnia as little more than a haircut with a Keanu-esque fuzziness around the eyes. In a free election a plausible case might be made for his nemesis King Miraz - played by the great Italian actor Sergio Castellitto - who is square-shouldered and decisive and by medieval king standards probably not all that bad. His beard may be too pointy for virtue but hes hardly evil enough to make it worth yanking the Pevensie siblings out of 1940s England. But yanked they are. They get their summons in a London subway station. In a nice visual sequence the walls shake reality cracks and the station falls away as the subway train disappears into the horizon. Next thing they know the kids are on a Narnian beach scampering around really happy to be out of England. They dont quite realize that there are other vacation destinations in the world that dont require killing people. Its sad but lets just say it This time out the kids are about as interesting as Chekov in a ""Star Trek"" sequel. Susan (Anna Popplewell) is sullen and unpleasant and Peter (William Moseley) the eldest is pompous. Edmund (Skandar Keynes) was shady last time but hes learned his lesson so now hes boring. And Lucy (Georgie Henley) is no longer a little girl with a cute character face but a pretty young lady on the brink of puberty. As such she no longer effortlessly embodies spiritually gifted innocence. It takes about a half hour for the bad news to sink in ""Prince Caspian"" has little character interest and depicts no earthshaking moral conflict. The Christian allegory unmistakable in ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" is nowhere to be found in ""Prince Caspian."" Not even its former outlines are apparent. Alas Lewis without Christianity just isnt Lewis. In all 144 minutes there are only about two or three that hint at the feeling that the whole movie needed to possess. Lucy gets up in the morning and finds Narnia as it used to be. She finds the trees no longer retreating into themselves but alive animate and welcoming. Animals speak. She walks along an enchanted path and talks briefly to Aslan the great Lion. Then she wakes up and takes the same walk in present-day Narnia and finds it no longer the living breathing place of spirit that it once was. Thats what the movie needed throughout a feeling of the consequences of living in a world without the presence of benevolent creation. Those are the true stakes of the battle not whether the kingdom is ruled by a pointy-bearded guy or by a lightweight who looks like Keanu Reeves. The movie needed to be about an unseen but palpable force of life - it didnt even have to be denominational or identifiably Christian. But it needed some of that grandeur and ecstasy. Thats the true source of epic scale. This has none just choruses and French horns on the soundtrack telling us we should be feeling things that were not. Very sad. Of course there are centaurs. Thats something. Theyre fighting with the good guys and theyre very serious these centaurs as if theyre overcompensating for being attached to a horses backside. Who could blame them? Actually there is one performance to take from the movie and its that of Peter Dinklage as Trumpkin a Narnian dwarf who joins the Pevensie children in their struggle against King Miraz. Crusty and taciturn Trumpkin has a softness underneath that enables him to particularly appreciate Lucy and this Dinklage suggests by subtle means. He sees something in her and he makes us almost see it too. -- Advisory Basically this is a movie about kids who go into another world and dimension and spend the whole time killing people. Lucy doesnt but the three others pile up about a score of corpses each. Be advised. The Chronicles of NarniaPrince Caspian Adventure.

"Prince Caspian reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Prince Caspian reviewed. Prince Caspian reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 15 2008 1159 AM Prince Caspian The Narnia series gets bleaker. By Dana Stevens The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian (Buena Vista Pictures) the second installment in the Narnia series based on C.S. Lewis fantasy novels bears the same relationship to Part 1 The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005) as late childhood does to early childhood. Its darker and bleaker and downright grim at times and that first enchantment of make-believe--the wonder of crawling into a musty wardrobe and finding the door to an alternate world full of talking beavers and hospitable fauns--has given way to the sober onset of adult responsibility. Of course the responsibilities borne by the Pevensie children--in descending order of age Peter (William Moseley) Susan (Anna Popplewell) Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley)--go way beyond the usual roster of childhood chores. Instead of emptying the cat-litter box and sorting the recycling they have to raise an army to save the land of Narnia from centuries of persecution by the Telmarines. This glowering race of men all of whom look like Velazquez portraits and talk like Antonio Banderas operates from a strict policy position of anti-whimsy. For some reason they have it in for the peaceful Narnians a ragtag assortment of sexy centaurs chatty rodents and curmudgeonly dwarves. The rightful heir to the Telmarine throne Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes) on the run from his usurping uncle Miraz (Sergio Castellito) unwittingly summons the Pevensies by blowing on an ancient horn. At once the children are spirited from a dreary train station in wartime London to the ruins of Cair Paravel castle in Narnia where 1300 years have passed since their last visit. Advertisement Aided by the valiant mouse Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard) and the grouchy dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage barely recognizable under prosthetics and makeup but savagely funny as ever) the Pevensies join the prince in a struggle for the liberation of Narnia and the overthrow of Miraz. (The brief electrifying reappearance of Tilda Swinton as the White Witch serves only to remind you what a dull villain Miraz makes by comparison.) What follows is somewhere between a gentle coming-of-age picture and a rousing medieval war epic complete with sword fights gryphon rides and faux Carl Orff on the soundtrack. Peter and Caspian square off over battle tactics Susan becomes a fierce archer while demurely evading Caspians moony gaze and Edmund contends with an epic case of middle-child syndrome. Meanwhile Lucy the youngest communicates in dreams with Aslan (voiced by Liam Neeson) the wise lion king/explicit Jesus stand-in who went to his sacrificial death at the end of Part 1. As in the first movie its only at the end when Aslan raises his fuzzy maned head to intervene on the side of right that Prince Caspian shows its cards as a property of Walden Media the childrens entertainment company owned by a Christian billionaire. The final stunningly staged battle sequence includes a vengeful water spirit whose long white beard and penchant for foe-smiting recalls the Old Testament God. To be fair the movie is no more proselytizing than its source material; Lewis was a born-again convert and the Narnia books were intended as religious parables. But the problem with the (literal) deus ex machina story structure in both the books and the movies is less ideological than narratological. Who cares about the death of a beloved character in a world where (if you know the right people--or lions) death itself is reversible? After the final battle Lucy anoints a few favored survivors with what amounts to a kind of anti-death serum so that we get to experience the thrill of near-annihilation without actually having to mourn. Richard Dawkins would have a field day with this vision of God as metaphysical Santa Claus cozily negating all possibility of real loss (and in fact when Lucy first received the healing elixir in Part 1 it was a gift from none other than Kris Kringle). But whatever their religious faith or lack of most viewers know a narrative cop-out when they see one. They may make for clunky religious parables but the Narnia books--and so far the movies based on them--are wonderful as stories about childhood and its loss. Toward the end of Prince Caspian it becomes clear that the two older children Peter and Susan are aging out of Narnia; theyve crossed over to the world of grown-ups and only Edmund and Lucy will be back for the next adventure. (Handily for the franchise which still has five more installments to go the books dont feature the Pevensie children throughout so these actors neednt commit to their roles for the next decade.) The scene in which the kids bid farewell to the dreamlike world thats become more real to them than their own has the emotional power of great childrens literature. Like Lewis Carrolls Alice L. Frank Baums Dorothy or E.B. Whites Fern the Pevensies live on the border between two realities the mundane and the magical. For those of us who have long since lost the ability to cross over its a pleasure to watch them make that journey. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic.

While the 2005 adaptation of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe kept close to the tone of the book Prince Caspian plays a little less like a fairy tale and a little more like an effort to expand the audience. Thats not necessarily a bad thing and it makes Prince Caspian more accessible to older would-be movie-goers. Overall while not as strong in terms of plotting or character development Prince Caspian is nevertheless a better cinematic experience than its predecessor if only because it feels more confident and polished. Adamson and his co-writers remain reasonably faithful to the source material although there are additions and deletions. The role of Aslan (voice of Liam Neeson) in the movie is significantly reduced from what it is in the book. On the other hand the battle scenes are beefed-up and a subplot is added focusing on a rivalry between Peter (William Moseley) and Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Meanwhile the movie version of the ""boy king"" Caspian has been aged into his mid-20s. He even has a mild flirtation with Susan (Anna Popplewell) - something definitely not found in C.S. Lewis writing. Prince Caspian transpires one year after the events of The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe in our world and 1300 years later in Narnia. Prince Caspian the true heir to Narnias throne has been denied his birthright by his uncle King Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). Now that Miraz has a son Caspian has been marked for death. He is aided in his escape from the castle by Dr. Cornelius (Vincent Grass) who also provides him with a valuable artifact - a horn to be used in only the most dire of circumstances. With Mirazs soldiers at his heels Caspian flees into the forests of Old Narnia where he encounters danger. Before being knocked unconscious he sounds the horn which summons the ""old kings and queens of Narnia"" from their mundane life in London. Peter Susan Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) arrive at the ruins of their former seat of power Cair Paravel. There they are able to reclaim their clothing and equipment from long ago. They also meet the dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) who tells them of the struggle between Caspian and Miraz and how they have been summoned to once again save the creatures of Narnia from evil. Under Caspians rule all of the birds beasts and humans of the land will be able to live in peace. Not so with Miraz in control. And where is Aslan? He has not been seen in centuries but shortly after their arrival Lucy claims to have glimpsed him. No one else believes hera| at first. The most stark area of difference between Prince Caspian and The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe relates to the diverse manners in which the films depict battle. The climactic clash in the first movie was perfunctory; here the final hour of the 137-minute motion picture is devoted to a series of skirmishes. As Peter Jackson did in The Two Towers Adamson has expanded a relatively short portion of the book into an epic segment in the movie. One could argue that the battles in Prince Caspian go on for too long (or that theres one too many of them - the sneak attack on Mirazs castle isnt in the book) but this is preferable to how war was handled in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Here theres a sense of breadth and scope to the death and destruction with a sanitized similarity to how things were handled in The Two Towers. And while theres no blood and gore to speak of Prince Caspian nevertheless contains some of the most extreme violence I have seen in a PG movie. In terms of the body count and the rather nasty ways in which some of the deaths occur this is really PG-13 material. Most of the special effects issues that plagued The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe have been corrected. The computer work is well integrated and there are few instances in which it calls attention to itself. Aslan is better rendered as are monsters like the minotaurs and centaurs and the talking animals like Reepicheep the valiant rodent and Trufflehunter the badger. One suspects however that as much as the effects artists were challenged with Prince Caspian thats nothing compared with what they will be faced with in the next installment The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Prince Caspians greatest weakness lies in middling character development. None of the individuals in this movie - neither the four returning children from the first movie nor the dashing newcomer - attains three-dimensionality. The rivalry between Peter and Caspian (a construct of the movie) is an attempt to flesh out personalities as are the quasi-romance between Susan and Caspian and Peters assertion that he can save the day. Despite these and other additions the protagonists feel half-formed and the audiences bond with them is tenuous. The chief villain King Miraz fares worse. He looks like King Leonidas from 300 but acts like Snidely Whiplash. Compared to Tilda Swintons White Witch hes unimpressive. In terms of its overall appeal to fantasy lovers Prince Caspian is a stronger movie than The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe and attempts have been made to capture that portion of the fantasy audience turned off by the child-friendly nature of the first movie. And although Prince Caspian is less directly allegorical than The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe it offers a message about the importance of having faith and Aslan remains a messianic figure. Adamson tones down the symbolism a little but not to the extent where it is unrecognizable. Nevertheless Prince Caspian does not come across like a sermon. As fantasy adventures go this one falls short of The Lord of the Rings pinnacle but there are enough rousing moments to make it worth the price of admission.

Lewis books. But be warned Not only are there kid-appropriate scenes of violence and a few scares theres also . . . kissing Yuck The possible transmission of cooties aside Prince Caspian packs a lot more action than its predecessor The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. It also adds the prince of the title and does nothing to make anyone think there wont be a third installment (recent rumors since debunked notwithstanding). The film begins with the birth of a boy - the son of Miraz (Sergio Castellitto) a power-hungry sort whos also the uncle of Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Caspian is the rightful heir to the throne but Miraz uses the occasion to seize power. He wants Caspian dead but the prince escapes into the woods and finds himself among Narninans long thought to be merely legends or extinct. Yes extinct. The setting for Prince Caspian is 1300 years after the first film at least in Narnian time. Yet for the Pevensie children Peter (William Moseley) Susan (Anna Popplewell) Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) only a year has passed since they the former kings and queens of Narnia had their last adventures. Its been a long year though. Settling back into the lives of London schoolkids is understandably something of a challenge. But as they wait in a subway station a desperate Caspian blows a horn - Susans magic horn which transports the children back to Narnia. Theyre confused by the changes at first but figure things out soon enough with the help of the Red Dwarf Trumpkin (Peter Dinklage) whos not eager to help. Eventually Caspian the Pevensies and the animals in the forest form an alliance in an attempt to restore Caspian to his rightful place so that he might once again welcome the animals and other creatures as equals. That will mean battles against Miraz who has bullied his way onto the Narnian throne. It will also mean overcoming doubting each other - particularly doubting Lucy who claims to have seen Aslan the lion who hasnt been seen in Narnia for 1000 years. Plus its understandable that Caspian and Peter might engage in a power struggle of their own. Caspian is the rightful heir to the throne but Peter is after all the High King though in a different age. Huh? As Edmund tells Miraz its difficult to explain. Luckily the tale at its heart is much simpler good vs. evil. At times its too simple. Although its obvious to everyone in the world - their world and ours - that Susan and Caspian have a little teenage flirtation going on its not developed enough. And by the time its clear were left feeling as though we missed something in the development of the relationship. Prince Caspian lacks the obvious religious overtones of Aslans death and resurrection in the first film - one could read the corruption of religion into this movie through Mirazs reign but its not a point thats hammered home - but it cranks up the action considerably. The effects are remarkable to the extent that any effects are anymore. Technology has gotten us to a place where a noble-talking mouse named Reepicheep (voiced by Eddie Izzard) no longer surprises us taking us out of the story. Now its an accepted part of storytelling in movies like this. Among the real-life actors Castellitto is outstanding as Miraz. Theres never any doubting his evil intent but he also portrays Miraz with a bit of humor particularly as we learn that his loyal subjects might not be quite so loyal after all. Dinklage ever reliable is funny and moving as Trumpkin. Barnes is the big-ticket item here Disneys newest star and although hes fine as Caspian hes not as central to the story as one might suspect. The true stars of Prince Caspian are the battle scenes massive affairs involving plenty of actors and plenty of computer-generated effects. Theyre exciting (and occasionally scary as when things dont go well during a raid on Mirazs castle). By the end the former kings and queens of Narnia are back on the subway platform waiting for their train waiting for another sequel. In comparison studying for a spelling test is once again going to seem pretty tame. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

(We know what a bad guy Miraz is from one look at his ugly pointed beard. No facial hair should be this sculpted.) The forces of Narnia -- spitfire dwarfs towering centaurs and other misfits -- are the underdogs but when it comes to sneaking past the royal walls they have advantages. The castle itself is impossibly tall -- it looks like a collection of mighty elongated chess rooks -- and so it helps to have a few griffins soar over the edifice to deposit key fighters. There is also a swashbuckling mouse (blithely voiced by Eddie Izzard) who could almost be a prankish cousin to Puss in Boots from the Shrek films. (Andrew Adamson director of Prince Caspian codirected the first two Shreks.) He wriggles up a pole and leaves a castle kitty cat bound in knots. And then theres the hulking humanoid ram just the thing to give an enemy soldier a start. As amusing as this can be the attempt by Caspian to win back his lost kingdom is really about all there is to the film -- which is to say this is a movie that showcases battle. Lots and lots of battle. As the soldiers pick up their broadswords and begin to slash and plunge Prince Caspian seizes and holds your attention yet it begins to look like any other mystically righteous clang-of-metal war movie. Creatures or no creatures we?ve seen it before. Like the C.S. Lewis novel its based on Prince Caspian follows a tradition of darkening sequels. In pop-fantasy cinema the trend was more or less set in motion by The Empire Strikes Back which ripened the underlying foreboding of Star Wars and it was then followed by the playfully (some would say perversely) demonic Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. It took the Harry Potter films an extra installment or two but that series got gravitas as well -- all to the benefit of its hellzapoppin Victorian toy-shop aesthetic. Prince Caspian taking on a similar spirit is a fierce and somber battle epic. It features soldiers in pewter armor lined up in rows like a sinister marching band against the Narnians who stand there with their bows and arrows trembling bravely at the odds against them. Yet make no mistake This is also a Disney film and so theres nothing too twisted ignoble or bloody about it. The real reason Prince Caspian is darker than 2005s The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is that it leans so much more heavily on medieval hardware than mysticism. Whats changed is the ratio of combat to enchantment. From the start you feel a comedown in magic. Instead of the wardrobe they employed before Peter Pevensie (William Moseley) and his fresh-faced siblings now journey to Narnia through a London subway tunnel landing on a sunny beach with rock formations that look a lot less wondrous than theyre supposed to. Peter along with Lucy (Georgie Henley) Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) has been away for a year but in Narnia time 1300 years have passed and so has the glorious revolution over which they presided. The creatures of Narnia are now exiled to the woods and as Miraz leader of the brutish Telmarines plots his nasty takeover Caspian and the Pevensie kids gather the disparate Narnians into that hopeful and collective thing...a fellowship After the Lord of the Rings trilogy I realize Im in the minority in finding the gathering of a fellowship to be a rather blah excuse for the plot of an adventure film. In this case the doubling up of noble young heroes doesnt help. As Caspian newcomer Ben Barnes has pouty lips an anonymous European accent and long hair that glows like something out of a teen-shampoo commercial. He comes off like the second coming of Orlando Bloom. In total effect Prince Caspian feels a lot more earthbound than The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. At least thats true until a surprise figure shows up his giant sculpted liquid face rising out of the waves of an aqua green river. Will viewers agree on what this face is? Or will they debate it the way that certain devout legions do when it is spotted mysteriously in the shadowed folds of a potato chip? B?

Unquestionably the first film sequel with the distinction of taking place 1300 years after the initial series installment ""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"" features more clanging swords than all the Robin Hood and Ivanhoe movies put together. Closer to a straight-ahead medieval battle picture than the fantastical other-worldly journey depicted in ""The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe"" this new entry is a bit darker more conventional and more crisply made than its 2005 predecessor which pulled in 292 million domestically and an amazing 452 million internationally. Given the abundant visual wonders and large action quotient Disney and Walden Media have no reason to fear B.O. will be far off those marks this time around. The second of C.S. Lewis seven books in the early 1950s series ""Prince Caspian"" returns the four Pevensie children to the magical realm more than a millennium in Narnian terms after they helped vanquish the White Witch to become kings and queens themselves. That the young actors have grown significantly gives the film a somewhat different more grounded feel as does the central presence of the title character a young man who must fight to claim the throne thats rightly his. Returning director Andrew Adamson and his co-screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely overhaul the novels structure by opening in Narnia with a childbirth and a related assassination attempt on Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes). Forced to flee from his castle Caspian ventures deep into a forest where his kind are not meant to go. By this time in Narnian history the colorful assortment of creatures and talking animals familiar from the initial story have been banished to the boonies supplanted in the power structure by the Telmarine race -- dark-haired types who speak with an unspecified Mediterranean accent. Suspicious of any Telmarine by nature the small band of dwarves centaurs and chatty furry critters arent sure what to make of Caspian who has been usurped by his venal uncle Lord Miraz (Sergio Castellitto). Enter the British kids who are delighted to depart wartime London but deflated to find the land they remember gone to ruin. In a lovely touch the Pevensies -- eldest Peter (William Moseley) blossoming young woman Susan (Anna Popplewell) teen Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and little Lucy (Georgie Henley) -- find themselves commemorated in cave art. The all-powerful lion Aslan proves elusive although Lucy pursues her own private contacts with him in the forest. Showing a surer sense of cinematic values in his second live-action venture ""Shrek"" vet Adamson stages the surging action with verve and a respect for old-school virtues rather than tricking it up with modern affectations. Caspians flight from the Telmarine castle -- a splendidly iconic one built on a rock and approachable only by bridge over a deep ravine -- and stealthy return in the dead of night are dramatically filmed in considerable darkness. The reappearance of Tilda Swintons White Witch is a riveting surprise but has the unfortunate side effect of making you wish shed step out of her pane of ice as she desperately desires to take a central role here. When all is said and done this is a pretty straightforward war film. Once Caspian escapes Mirazs men methodically prepare to conquer the wayward Narnians by building a big bridge across the river to the forest. Final combat comes in two stages. First to avoid carnage on both sides a winner-takes-all mano a mano is arranged between the vain Miraz and Peter (who for 15 years was High King of Narnia after all). Scene is tensely and intensely enacted with some unusual details. When this doesnt do the trick however the two armies pour it on with the balance swaying this way and that for nearly a half-hour of CGI-dominated mayhem. Given that theres no question as to how it will turn out and that Aslan will eventually intervene at the crucial moment pic is still able to play a couple visual-effects trump cards that provide something audiences havent seen before. Barnes has the dark dashing looks that will make teen girls turn out more than they normally would for a battle epic. The undercurrent of attraction between him and the now mature Susan adds a measure of romantic appeal as does the latters evolution into something of an action heroine. The four kids overall have more character and are therefore more interesting to watch than they were before and Italian actor Castellitto registers strongly with evil thats implacable but not overplayed. Required locations featuring forests mountains and open ground in New Zealand Poland Slovenia and the Czech Republic provide an overall feel of timeless untouched natural surroundings and the cascade of visual effects are even more impressive than they were the first time around. Production values are tops and Harry Gregson-Williams score vigorously supports the films forward movement without becoming overbearing.
