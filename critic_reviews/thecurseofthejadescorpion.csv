Joffe Productions Perido Productions Sweetland Films VCL Communications; Release Date Wide 08/24/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 103; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Dreamworks Distribution L.L.C. Posted September 20 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT In ""His Girl Friday"" Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell turn their flirtation into high-speed spitball comedy; the more they fight the more we know that theyre smitten. Woody Allens The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is a boutique trifle set in 1940 the year that ""His Girl Friday"" came out but when Allen and his costar Helen Hunt engage in their version of knife-tongued competitive warfare all we see is two characters who look as if they hate each other. Allens CW is a hard-boiled New York insurance investigator and Hunt is Betty Ann a beautiful efficiency expert. She gazes at her new underling and sees a sleazy pushy resentful middle-aged loser and the perversity of the movie is that nothing in Allens script or performance leads us to think any different. A would-be whimsical caper that fuses hypnosis thievery and romance ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" wears its confectionary ""smallness"" on its lapel but that doesnt mean that its a fun light snack; its more like a cupcake that never rises. Out on the town for a coworkers birthday CW and Betty are put into a trance by Voltan (David Ogden Stiers) a sinister showbiz mesmerist who gets them to confess (or does he plant the idea?) that theyre deeply in love. Before long hes hypnotizing CW over the telephone and ordering him to commit jewel heists which CW then has to investigate with no awareness that hes responsible for the crimes. (The jaunty New Orleans rag ""In a Persian Market"" that plays over the robberies is the best thing in the film.) Its a wisp of a clever idea but Allen coming off the intricate and funny ""Small Time Crooks"" has regressed to the leaden high jinks mode of ""Broadway Danny Rose"" and ""Manhattan Murder Mystery."" Its not just his prankish wry touch thats gone soft; he seems fundamentally deluded about his image as well. I dont want to sound like Im jumping on the bandwagon of sexual correctness by claiming that Allen is too old and wizened to be playing a shlub who can still win Helen Hunts heart but here goes At 65 Allen is too old and wizened to be playing a shlub who can still win Helen Hunts heart. The fact that it takes a hypnotist to bring these two together would seem to be Allens token acknowledgment of the fanciful incongruity of the relationship but the fairy-tale chemistry in ""Jade Scorpion"" is so contrived that its nearly abstract. As a plot device hypnosis has to rank right down there with amnesia-inducing conks on the head You may instantly want to lose all memory of how little fun youre having. Through it all CW is meant to be a scruffy charmer. He hooks up with a statuesque party girl (Charlize Theron) in Veronica Lake hair and she practically tries to wrestle him into bed. More than unseemly it feels wrong; the entire machinery of the movie seems to be rotating around Woody Allens vanity. He remains a canny (if in this case hollow) film craftsman but by now we know him far too well to be asked to find him adorable.

Woody Allen plays an insurance detective under a spell and Helen Hunt is a woman he kisses in ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion."" Curse is old hat / Once again Woody Allen romances younger women 1 / 1 Back to Gallery CURSE OF THE JADE SCORPION Romantic comedy. Starring Woody Allen and Helen Hunt. Directed by Woody Allen. 100 minutes. (PG-13. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" finds Woody Allen at a peculiar juncture. As a writer-director he is drawn to romantic stories and as an actor hes the best at putting over his own material. But at 65 hes too old to be in a Woody Allen movie particularly one in which he kisses Helen Hunt (whos 38) and romances Charlize Theron (whos 26). The problem wont get better with time. Allen is inexhaustibly prolific and longevity runs in his family. He may yet live to become the first man ever to play a love scene with a woman 70 years his junior. Actresses yet unborn may someday see Allen coming at them on the silver screen. By then hell be making horror movies. As for ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" its middling Allen which means that fans wont be sorry to see it while everyone else can wait until the next ""Bullets Over Broadway."" Allen makes so many films we tend to take him for granted. So it pays to realize that this is a man who has made more good or great movies than any other writer-director ever to work in America -- including Sturges Welles Chaplin and Keaton. He is already an immortal though alas not in a way that might allow him someday to do love scenes with women say 800 years his junior. ""Curse"" is set in 1940 for no reason but that Allen likes the period. He plays insurance detective CW Briggs who loathes the offices new efficiency expert Betty Ann (Helen Hunt). One day CW and his co-workers all go to a nightclub to celebrate the 50th birthday of a colleague -- played by Wallace Shawn whom Allen presumably keeps casting in order to have a guy around whos shorter than he is. There they see a magician (David Ogden Stiers) do a hypnosis act. As part of the act the magician puts CW and Betty Ann into a trance and though he snaps them out of it he leaves them susceptible to suggestion. His motive becomes apparent soon afterward when he calls CW puts him under hypnosis and sends him out to do a jewel robbery. Thats the comic setup By day CW investigates a string of jewel robberies with no awareness or recollection that hes the one committing the crimes. Many of the jokes fall flat and the film has a musty smell about it like an apartment someone has been living in for too long. Yet the picture plays out pleasantly and Allen creates a world thats easy to inhabit. Some scenes stand out -- for example when CW trying to make friends with Betty Ann takes her for a disastrous after-work drink. Hunts abruptness and lack of sentimentality make her a good foil for Allen and dressed in 1940s fashions she has never looked as stunning. But her beauty only accentuates the bizarreness of her being matched with Allen. Though for most of ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" the two are fighting this is a pattern as old as Beatrice and Benedick in ""Much Ado About Nothing."" We know its a romance. And we also know that she looks a foot taller than he is and probably outweighs him. Allen seems to grasp that hes running the risk of making an entire audience barf so he has Hunt call him ""worm"" and ""insect."" Allen adopts the same strategy with Charlize Theron whos about the prettiest woman in movies now. She plays a spoiled rich girl a kind of Lauren Bacall with a Veronica Lake haircut and -- brace yourself -- she finds CW attractive though she goes into a litany of reasons why she shouldnt. Yet for all the put-down lines neither Hunt or Theron ever utters the ""o"" word old. It might have helped. At the very least a line like ""Youre 40 years older than I am and look like death on a stick"" would have gone a long way toward assuring audiences that theyre not watching a movie filmed on Jupiter.

"USATODAY.com - Allens Scorpion delivers lightweight comic sting Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 08/23/2001 - Updated 0246 PM ET Allens Scorpion delivers lightweight comic sting By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY The Curse of the Jade Scorpion (out of four) Stars Woody Allen Helen Hunt Dan Aykroyd Director Woody Allen Distributor DreamWorks Rating PG-13 for some sexual content A retro Woody Allen in a hypnotic trance is almost as funny as a contemporary Woody Allen in a neurotic snit. Thats one of the more substantial revelations one can glean from the vintage trinket The Curse of the Jade Scorpion. In the comics lightweight flirtation with 40s film noir he channels Bogart by way of Bob Hope as a self-proclaimed grubby little insurance investigator from Manhattan who ends up investigating himself. Whenever David Ogden Stiers unscrupulous nightclub magician says ""Constantinople"" Allen enters the zombie zone -- face stony pace plodding attitude oblivious -- and unwittingly pulls off jewel heists. All the while the mesmerizing rhythms of jazz standard In a Persian Market boom and plunk along. Read more Video The Curse of the Jade Scorpion trailer Photo Gallery Woodys world Related Woody Allen in the mood Woody Allen Qamp;A Woodys West Coast swing jazzes L.A. Its a reminder that the filmmaker used to be able to go Bananas and score with physical as well as verbal wit. And since a goodly portion of Jade is given over to the barbed banter lobbed by Allen and a solid Helen Hunt (in Stanwyck mode as a peevish efficiency expert who challenges his facade of male superiority) Woody the wordsmith is in full evidence too. He describes their vast differences ""She graduated from Vassar and I went to driving school."" Her pet names for him inspired by his overtly sexist inclinations include orangutan ferret weasel roach reptile vermin worm and termite. When she huffily offers to leave a bar first so people dont think they are together he sneers ""Why? Do I look like an organ grinder?"" Of course they are destined to fall for each other. Or rather programmed to after Stiers fogs their minds with the power of passionate suggestion. Not that there arent roadblocks. The secretly softhearted Hunt is having an affair with their married boss (Dan Aykroyd doing his best Fred MacMurray as gentlemanly cad). And then there is Allens cat burglar habit. The rest of Jade provides pleasant respite from effects-swamped insanity that passes for summer movies. It aint great Woody by a long shot and his battling with Hunt grows tiresome. But its better than his last outing Small Time Crooks and its stilted stoogery. Think of this as Old Time Crooks. Santo Loquastos exquisite period detail in dreamy shades of gold brown and orange is perfection down to the glasswear and wall calendars. Giving the set design plenty of competition though is Charlize Theron. The eye-popper of a femme fatale the daughter of society clan whose jewels are missing is part Veronica Lake part Lauren Bacall and all hot to trot with Allen whose sexual bravado crumbles in her vampish wake. Is there more than meets the eye? Not really although given Allens all-too-public romantic travails maybe he should have been seeing a hypnotist instead of a therapist all these years. At least at age 65 hes owning up to the fact that his onscreen love interests may be a tad young. As Hunt says ""Youre too old for me youre too nearsighted for me youre too short for me."" Replies Allen ""Youre leaving out the best part Im also losing my hair."" At least he still has most of his touch.

"CNN.com - Review No sting to Jade Scorpion - August 23 2001 MAIN PAGE WORLD U.S. WEATHER BUSINESS SPORTS POLITICS LAW SCI-TECH SPACE HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT TRAVEL EDUCATION IN-DEPTH QUICK NEWS LOCAL COMMUNITY MULTIMEDIA E-MAIL SERVICES CNNtoGO ABOUT US CNN TV whats on show transcripts CNN Headline News CNN International askCNN EDITIONS CNN.com Asia CNN.com Europe set your edition Languages --------- Time Inc. --------- Time.com People Fortune EW Not a bad film not a good film Review No sting to Jade Scorpion By Paul TataraCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- Woody Allen has been quoted as saying that his script for ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" a rather distressingly routine film noir pastiche originated as ""just a funny premise and the rest is whatever spun out of that."" And thats exactly whats wrong with it. There used to be considerable focus and magnetism to Allens comic perceptions a unique overriding sense of purpose. But most of his recent films reveal an increasingly uninterested artist riffing on flimsy ideas. ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" is another New York period piece this one set in 1940. Allen is C.W. Briggs a womanizing insurance investigator. The messy office where Briggs works is full of veteran detectives who like to do things their own way but C.W.s legendary technique is being threatened by a recently hired efficiency expert named Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt). Betty Ann despises C.W. Hes whiny (of course) and shes openly repulsed by his incessant pursuit of sexy young women. Given that Allen now looks like a scrawny 65-year old man -- because thats exactly what he is -- youre liable to agree with her. It seems that Allen now makes pictures out of habit rather than desire or ambition and the results often feel more like rough drafts than finished products. Laugh-wise ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" falls somewhere in the middle of what can accurately be described as his ""mediocre period."" Its not a complete head-scratching washout like ""Alice"" (1990) or ""Celebrity"" (1998). But theres hardly any steam to the narrative and the insult-laden dialogue often sounds like wham-bam sitcom banter.

Woody Allens The Curse of the Jade Scorpion is a boutique trifle set in 1940 the year that ""His Girl Friday"" came out but when Allen and his costar Helen Hunt engage in their version of knife-tongued competitive warfare all we see is two characters who look as if they hate each other. Allens CW is a hard-boiled New York insurance investigator and Hunt is Betty Ann a beautiful efficiency expert. She gazes at her new underling and sees a sleazy pushy resentful middle-aged loser and the perversity of the movie is that nothing in Allens script or performance leads us to think any different. A would-be whimsical caper that fuses hypnosis thievery and romance ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" wears its confectionary ""smallness"" on its lapel but that doesnt mean that its a fun light snack; its more like a cupcake that never rises. Out on the town for a coworkers birthday CW and Betty are put into a trance by Voltan (David Ogden Stiers) a sinister showbiz mesmerist who gets them to confess (or does he plant the idea?) that theyre deeply in love. Before long hes hypnotizing CW over the telephone and ordering him to commit jewel heists which CW then has to investigate with no awareness that hes responsible for the crimes. (The jaunty New Orleans rag ""In a Persian Market"" that plays over the robberies is the best thing in the film.) Its a wisp of a clever idea but Allen coming off the intricate and funny ""Small Time Crooks"" has regressed to the leaden high jinks mode of ""Broadway Danny Rose"" and ""Manhattan Murder Mystery."" Its not just his prankish wry touch thats gone soft; he seems fundamentally deluded about his image as well. I dont want to sound like Im jumping on the bandwagon of sexual correctness by claiming that Allen is too old and wizened to be playing a shlub who can still win Helen Hunts heart but here goes At 65 Allen is too old and wizened to be playing a shlub who can still win Helen Hunts heart. The fact that it takes a hypnotist to bring these two together would seem to be Allens token acknowledgment of the fanciful incongruity of the relationship but the fairy-tale chemistry in ""Jade Scorpion"" is so contrived that its nearly abstract. As a plot device hypnosis has to rank right down there with amnesia-inducing conks on the head You may instantly want to lose all memory of how little fun youre having. Through it all CW is meant to be a scruffy charmer. He hooks up with a statuesque party girl (Charlize Theron) in Veronica Lake hair and she practically tries to wrestle him into bed. More than unseemly it feels wrong; the entire machinery of the movie seems to be rotating around Woody Allens vanity. He remains a canny (if in this case hollow) film craftsman but by now we know him far too well to be asked to find him adorable.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Woody Allen is in a matinee mood for ""The Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" a modest tribute to both the mystery programmers that once preceded the main attraction on the double bill and the spirit of his true movie hero Humphrey Bogart. Certainly not a piffle nor an impressive departure into a new filmmaking realm Allens second film in a row about crooks ranks in the middle range of his work. Its also a return to his favorite era a pre-World War II past when you could turn on a radio and hear Harry James Glenn Miller or Duke Ellington when office meetings took place in smoky bars and -- most crucially here -- when hypnotism and mesmerism were all the rage. Moving along at an entertaining clip with an uncommon degree of plot development but without the kind of moments to stir up discussion in summers Dog Days ""Scorpion"" should have a theatrical run in line with Allens typically calm B.O. performance. The large bold numbers ""1940"" cover the screen after opening credits removing any doubt where we are in the final innocence of the Depression when powerful women in business like Betty Ann Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt) were quite the anomaly. The personalities of Hitler and Mussolini come to the mind of CW Briggs (Allen) when he thinks of Betty Ann since she wants to so to speak make the trains run on time at Northcoast Insurance where CW has worked as an investigator for 20 years. Shes a woman of the new modern era streamlining Northcoasts bustling offices for maximum efficiency. He on the other hand does his gumshoe work by gathering undercover tips from various street bums when he isnt leering at the secretaries or placing bets on the Giants. Since Betty Ann wouldnt know the word sexist she likens CW to various lower and extinct members of the animal kingdom from dinosaurs to weasels to worms. But for all his faults and insecurities at least CW isnt carrying on an office affair with a married employee like Betty Ann is with Northcoast topper Chris Magruder (Dan Aykroyd). So when the office gang goes out on the town for co-worker Georges (Wallace Shawn) birthday its their gag to get CW and Betty Ann up on stage with hypnotist Voltan (David Ogden Stiers) who promptly lulls them into a marital romance with a swinging Chinese jade pendant and the magic Bogey-era words ""Madagascar"" and ""Constantinople."" Later that night Voltan phones CW at home and with the same magic words orders him to rob jewels from the Kensington estate whose security measures were set up under Northcoasts purview. There isnt a moment here that lapses out of period not even during any of CWs verbal battles with Betty Ann (made wearisome however with repeated patterns of insult) -- its a sign of Allens enormous affection for Jazz Era Gotham which is depicted by helmers longest continuing collaborator Santo Loquasto in burnished interiors accented with wood brass and light wallpaper with few of the exterior flourishes of a ""Radio Days."" The re-creation extends beyond the furnishings and Suzanne McCabes attractive costuming to pics ostensible mystery woman Laura Kensington (Charlize Theron) who appears to be Veronica Lakes twin. Therons Laura whips her blonde mane around like a weapon but this is a story without the expected femme fatale. Laura is here rather unimaginatively as a mere plot device first to get CW confused about where hes been and what ladies hes been seeing late at night and later to help bust him out of a police station after hes arrested for not one but two thefts of Kensington jewels. CW like Bogart always did has other private eyes to deal with such as the Coopersmith brothers (Michael Mulheren and Peter Linari) whom Magruder has enjoined to help crack the case. But since their work points the finger at CW himself hes in the jam of his life and forced to hide at Betty Anns. Allens story rarely goes below surface events or even -- despite the many tussles between CW and Betty Ann -- characters so that a charming turn at the end feels like no more than a sweet passing touch. Little remains after ""Jade Scorpion"" is over other than a hazy nostalgic sense for a time that most viewers never knew and that Allen himself was barely old enough to remember. In the largest role hes written for himself since at least ""Mighty Aphrodite"" Allen is unafraid of appearing nearly as wormy as CW is labeled and a stuttering fool in the face of women he cant handle. Rather than pushing the pose Allen carves a performance that comments on Bogart (but shorn of narration) a contrasting variation on his Bogey-obsessed character in ""Play It Again Sam."" Hunts Betty Ann is pics most original creation not quite as cold as CW would deem her and with enough vulnerability under the undefined feminism to collapse under the heat of passion. Aykroyd rigorously sticks to his assignment as the serious company man and guilt-ridden cheating husband without one joke slipping through his lips. Making a fine ominous entrance but with little to do after that Theron provides sultry atmospherics as does a fine supporting cast. Offices have rarely looked warmer as framed in Zhao Feis golden-hued lensing and the jazz soundtrack includes not only the obligatory Big Band sound but some piano care of Earl ""Fatha"" Hines.
