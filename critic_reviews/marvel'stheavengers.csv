You dont need me to tell you its the culmination of a five-year plan that began with Samuel L. Jacksons Nick Fury taking Tony Stark aside at the end of the first ""Iron Man"" to tip him off as to the ""Avengers Initative."" There is a bigger picture he told him -- and here it is The be-all but not (theyre hoping) the end-all of the current craze for CGI-enhanced superheroics.Interspersing flip one-liners with a host of larger-than-life characters and the usual flurry of fight-and-flight scenes the film is never less than amusing. Still its never more than amusing either. Marvel Studios has made it a point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the DC / Warner Bros Batman films. The lightness is fun but it doesnt offer much of a foundation on which to build an epic.And lets face it theres more than a whiff of opportunism about a project that pits a defrosted World War II hero Captain America (Chris Evans) an inventor-industrialist Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) the pagan lightning god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) a scientist with anger-management issues Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) against the Norse god of mischief Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a legion of marauding aliens. In 3-D.Still Whedon (who shares a screenplay credit with Zak Penn) is a very sharp operator.

The improbability of this misfit coalition becomes the movies most rewarding asset. Imagine the bristling egos of so many power players cooped up in the same room The movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand-offs. Not surprisingly Robert Downey Jr.s flip cynical Stark (Iron Man) gets a good measure of the movies best lines bouncing off Steve Rogers (Captain America) boy scout idealism and Thors guileless sledgehammer style (sometimes literally). Whedon also crafts a couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow a far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in ""Iron Man 2.""But no question the movies not-so-secret weapon is Hulk.Share your review of ""The Avengers""Mark Ruffalo is the third actor to play Bruce Banner/Hulk in the past decade and even though the soft-spoken star would seem to have the longest fuse (when we first see him hes tending to the sick in an Indian slum) hes immediately both more dangerous and more fun than either Edward Norton or Eric Bana in the same role. Whedon gives him a long build up. For the first hour of the movie were invited to speculate along with his new allies just how much havoc Banners rampaging id might cause. Then the leash comes offNever underestimate the entertainment value of the Hulk Smash. Thats probably the most important lesson to be drawn here and one that clearly hasnt been lost on the filmmakers who have reportedly signed Ruffalo to a six-picture deal.Beyond that the movie wants us to believe that these action figures have learned to play nice and work as a team -- which is good news for humanity but maybe not so promising for the inevitable sequels. A climax on the war-torn streets of Manhattan could almost be an extended outtake from the last ""Transformers"" flick -- Whedon can only push the blockbuster form so far -- but if its a Friday Night SmackDown youre after ""Avengers"" gets the job done.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

By Anthony Lane Marvel superheroes.   Credit Photograph by Grant Cornett If you are a Marvel fan then ""The Avengers"" will feel like Christmas. Thanks to the merry doings of the director Joss Whedon all your favorite characters are here as shiny and as tempting as presents under the tree. You get Tony Stark better known as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); Steve Rogers or Captain America (Chris Evans); Natasha Romanoff or Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson); Bruce Banner or the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo); and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) whose real name is Thor. None of the weirdos from ""X-Men"" make the grade nor do half-pints like Ghost Rider or the Silver Surfer though I think that Whedon missed a trick for old times sake why not zip back to the first Marvel movie and wheel out Howard the Duck? If you are not a Marvel fan on the other hand then watching ""The Avengers"" will feel like being mugged by a gang of rowdy sociopaths with high muscle tone. Absolutely no quarter is given to the ill-informed; the first scene is set in an undesignated patch of outer space where some masked moaner yaks on in a rich and threatening baritone. I couldnt understand a word until he asked ""The humans--what can they do but burn?"" If he is referring to our cooking skills this is grossly unfair for we can also poach broil gently simmer and steam en papillote. The speech however will make complete sense to those familiar with last years ""Thor"" whose villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is revived for the new film. Loki is a tall well-spoken megalomaniac who bears a magic spear although for anyone who enjoyed Hiddlestons spry and convincing turn in ""Midnight in Paris"" the world would appear to be at the mercy of F. Scott Fitzgerald with a monkey wrench. And it always is the world. One of the failings of Marvel--as of other franchises like the ""Superman"" series--is the vulgarity that comes of thinking big. As a rule be wary of any guy who dwells upon the fate of mankind unless he can prove that he was born in Bethlehem. Superheroes who claim to be on the side of the entire planet are no more to be trusted than the baddies who seek to trash it nor is the aesthetic timbre of the movies in which they both appear. I remember the joy of reading David Thomsons entry on Howard Hawks in ""A Biographical Dictionary of Film""; the principle underlying Hawkss work Thomson argued was that ""Men are more expressive rolling a cigarette than saving the world"" and his adage rings true far beyond ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"" or ""The Big Sleep."" All movies thrive on the rustle of private detail--on pleasures and pains that last as long as a smoke--and there has been nothing more peculiar in recent years than watching one Marvel epic after the next then sifting through the rubble of gigantism in search of dramatic life. If it smolders in ""The Avengers"" that is owing to Downey and Ruffalo two A-grade actors who are damned if they are going to be smothered by a two-hundred-million-dollar B movie. Downey realized in ""Iron Man"" that spectacular pap could be made piquant only if the central icon was a jerk--a narcissist with a roaring cash flow rescuing not Earth from destruction but way more important his own soul from fidgety ennui. Ruffalo at the other extreme is all diffidence and glancing timidity; as Banner he seems embarrassed by the prospect of his own wrath and there is a wonderful closeup of the sad apologetic glow in his eyes as he turns green. Banner begins the film as a practicing doctor (not just any doctor but in line with Marvels overreach a doctor in an Indian slum) and ends as we might have guessed slinging humongous metal lizards around the canyons of Manhattan. The best way to treat ""The Avengers"" is as cinemas answer to the supergroup. Stark and his buddies club together just as Bob Dylan George Harrison and the others did to form the Traveling Wilburys. Harrison wondered what it would be like to tour ""Would each person do a solo set and then do Wilburys at the end or would we all go right on from beginning to end and make everything Wilburys?"" Whedon leans toward the first option and so come the climax they all do Wilburys even as Thor tosses his mallet Iron Man hurls energy pulses from his palms while Captain America waves his slightly underwhelming shield and not to be left out Black Widow repels invading aliens through the sheer force of her corsetry. This mania is what Marvel followers have hungered for and it would be fruitless to deny their delight. As Loki says to a crowd of earthlings ""It is the unspoken truth of humanity that you crave subjugation."" We do Master we do. The hero of ""Headhunters"" is named Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie) and his height is one metre sixty-eight--five feet six. He tells us so at the start of the film and again at the end. What happens in between consists of his convoluted bloodbathed attempt to stand tall. Given that his wife Diana (Synnove Macody Lund) whom he worships towers over him like a heron over a tit you can vaguely understand his point of view. Roger is unlikely though it sounds Norwegian. He works in Oslo at a high-end recruitment agency--hence if only in part the movies title. He moonlights as an art thief typically booking a client into a crucial interview and then at the appointed hour slipping into the guys empty house and relieving him of a picture. Roger is aided by a contact at a security firm Ove (Eivind Sander) who disables the alarm and takes his cut. The sight of Ove--seedy balding and distractible with a Russian playmate in tow--is an early hint that ""Headhunters"" may run less than sweetly. Indeed once the story barrels forward you sense that the game plan of the director Morten Tyldum is not just to pick up speed or tickle our nerves but to rebuke and where possible deface the calm smile-lacquered gloss of corporate life. The stumble comes as stumbles do when a weak soul upgrades the reach of his ambition--specifically when Roger who is low on funds and needs a major heist graduates from Munch prints to a Rubens oil painting. It is owned by Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who seems custom-made for the role of Rogers nemesis a former special-forces operative the head of a tech company that specializes in tracking devices and a handsome brute to boot. Worst of all he meets Diana who works at an art gallery and takes her to bed. From here the plot is a plunge--over the edge of a cliff out of a hospital window into a pit of ordure and so forth. At one point a snarling dog is speared on the back of a tractor imagine a Carl Hiaasen novel shipped over from Florida to Norway. Clearly there are streaks of farce in all this as well as serious cracks in logic and those who like their black comedy done to a crisp will happily feast on what Tyldum dishes up. (The tale is based on a thriller by Jo Nesbo.) My own taste for nastiness has I admit grown less tolerant with time and by a dour coincidence I saw ""Headhunters"" on the first day of the trial of Anders Behring Breivik the fanatic who murdered seventy-seven people last year first in Oslo and then on the island of Utoya. The recitation of those events as heard by the court has proved unrelievedly bleak. Should the thought of them disturb ones enjoyment of ""Headhunters"" or do outrageous fictions owe nothing to intolerable fact? Either way Norwegians had no qualms; whatever their collective trauma they flocked to the movie when it opened in Norway a month after Breiviks crime. ""Headhunters"" a gleeful exercise in overkill became the second-most-successful film of the year. The American rights had been sold before filming began so the remake should not be long in coming. The question is who will play Roger? My advice to casting agents start looking for a shorter wider younger paler Christopher Walken more freaked out than freaking with pumpkin-colored locks. (Hair and how you get rid of it is a big deal in this movie.) Get Roger right and the rest of the story will follow; pick the wrong man and it will founder in a swamp of implausibility. Aksel Hennies Roger certainly will be hard to top. It seems ridiculous that we should warm to this super-creep and yet by the end he has our sympathy. Something about him invites humiliation and Tyldum does not hang back from piling on the shame; that is why Rogers very doggedness commands respect. Watch him in Dianas gallery as he sees her flirt with Clas at an evening party--a pair of superior beings at play. The look in Rogers eyes wide but steady is perfect in its mortification and my immediate response was what a superb Iago this actor would make--what pleasure he would take in his vengeful acts and how irreparably he would be fouled up in the consequence. ""Headhunters"" is admirably swift in style and dangerously silly in what it begs us to swallow but at its heart is a consummate depiction of a permanent type--the proud and prickly male thrown back on his desperate wits. Small may not be beautiful but it lives.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Critics Notebook Does The Avengers Belong at the Tribeca Film Festival? Eric Kohn Apr 27 2012 1005 am erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk ""The Avengers"" will play like gangbusters at the closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival this Saturday. This is less prediction than absolute certainty. A movie that yells at you and geeks out in equal measures the Marvel-Paramount excursion marks the triumphant climax of a five-year effort to merge several tentpole movies into a single explosive whole. Directed by ultimate fanboy/genre auteur Joss Whedon within an inch of his life it has the exemplary polish of a brilliant commercial achievement in the most literal sense It plays like several mini-sequels strung together in a spectacularly fluid combination as Marvel comics have for decades illustrating convergence culture on a massive scale. Once Whedon goes through the motions of assembling his colorful team a motley gang of action figures comprised of Iron Man Hulk Thor Captain America and Hawkeye his swirling camera cant get enough of them indulging in multiple Avengers glam shots that yes marvel at their sensational pop beauty. Its a monumentally successful attempt to show off the first genuine superhero crowdpleaser. Its also undoubtedly too long and too loud. The snazzy display gets exhausting and I have a hard time imagining anyone remembering it too clearly in 20 or 30 years. Despite the rush of the action the technical splendor of ""The Avengers"" never feels particularly groundbreaking or distinctive. Singularly great visual gags involving the Hulk and characteristically snarky one-liners from Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark carry the movie far better than the steady cascade of explosions. ""The Avengers"" is grand escapist fluff best appreciated in the context of its release as a major event movie. That makes its spot as the closing night film the Tribeca Film Festival an ideal venue. However when ""The Avengers"" was first announced as Tribecas closing selection a few weeks back I detected plenty of grousing from a lot of people who dont ordinarily pay much attention to the film festival world at all. Why they wondered would an alleged haven for independently produced artistically sound movies make room for this unapologetic example of blockbuster excess? In this case the backlash is unfounded. Hardly anyone levels missives at Cannes for showing celebrity-studded franchise junk alongside the latest achievements by world class auteurs that usually dominate its main competition. Thats partly because Tribeca is an easier target but critiquing its inclusion of a legitimately satisfying movie on its own terms misses the point. Each year many of us struggle to understand Tribecas purpose. Its founders insist they have taken a generalist approach. Thats a challenging goal given its placement on the festival calendar between the behemoths of Sundance and Cannes but if Tribeca only aims to showcase the range of cinema from around the world then it should contain a certain amount of Hollywood product. And theres simply no better example of the todays studio system doing what it does best than ""The Avengers.""Crucially ""The Avengers"" arrives at the end of the festival but does not define it. With a program large enough to represent a vast range of international cinemas the festival evades an issue facing the European festival circuit where many large festivals must include a certain number of national films. At least on paper Tribeca contains a very diverse program even if the lineup has yet to garner significant respect within the industry. Yesterdays awards ceremony illustrated that its largely not the new movies that dominate the festival. ""War Witch"" Kim Nguyens intense thoroughly engrossing African drama about a teen bride pursued by insurgents premiered in February in Berlin as did ""Una Noche"" the acclaimed Cuban drama that nabbed Tribecas acting prizes. But thats an issue pertaining to the quality of the lineup not the special events which usually generate more talk than any of the world premieres (nobody remembers that awful Cameron Crowe documentary about Elton John from last years opening night but many fondly recall Johns lovely performance after the screening). ""The Avengers"" belongs at Tribeca because the festivals strongest suit is its ability to throw a big bash which is not a pithy achievement and could actually help more movies. ""The Avengers"" doesnt need the help but Ill gladly play devils advocate on this one If Tribeca can do this for ""The Avengers"" it can do it for anyone. An experienced colleague from the festival world recently suggested to me that Tribeca may want to drop the ""film festival"" label altogether and embrace its existing strengths. Call a spade a spade -- or maybe call it a ""celebration of film."" No longer facing insurmountable expectations Tribeca could effectively remove itself from a supremely competitive premiere-oriented world in which every lineup is held hostage by the calendar. By those standards ""The Avengers"" (which actually premiered last week in Los Angeles) doesnt only fit in at Tribeca; it epitomizes one part of the festival that works as well as the commercial feat behind the movies existence.

NonesuchThis American Lifes Ira Glass once aptly described writer/director Joss Whedon as ""one of those people who either you have never heard of him at all...or you love him."" To those of you who in your millions are about to make the transition from the former cohort to the latter Welcome. The probable catalyst for this conversion is of course Whedons The Avengers. (I should note here that I am technically supposed to refer to the film as Whedons Marvels The Avengers but Im not going to because that would be ridiculous. Were the honchos at Marvel concerned that their 60-something target audience would be confused by the absence of Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg? I think not.) When news first broke that an Avengers movie was in the making I thought there was no possible way it could work too many supers too many awkwardly intersecting storylines too much everything. When news broke that Whedon would be helming the project I thought well if theres one person who could conceivably make it work it was him. I was wrong the first time and right the second. The Avengers is sharp witty intense and at times even touching--easily among the best big-budget entertainments of the last few years.For those only now becoming acquainted with Mr. Whedon he is the pop-nerd god responsible for the TV shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel Firefly and Dollhouse; the feature film Serenity (a Firefly spinoff that is among the most criminally neglected movies of the past decade); and the wondrous web-short Dr. Horribles Sing-Along Blog. Back in the day he co-wrote the original Toy Story and more recently he co-wrote and produced the deliriously inventive The Cabin in the Woods. Perhaps more to the point he was the author of a by-all-accounts exceptional stretch of the comic The Astonishing X-Men. Silly as it may sound The Avengers is to a surprising degree an experiment in social chemistryYet despite this exhausting C.V. The Avengers is Whedons first true bite at the apple of mass appeal. It is my humble prediction that the masses are going to stay bitten. Now it is true that if you dont like superhero movies you probably will not like The Avengers which features all the tropes that inevitably accrue to the genre the flying and punching and force-beams and silly costumes. But if you are even modestly open to persuasion Whedons effort is right up at the top of the Marvel heap with the first Spider- and Iron Man and the first two X-Men. Given the degree of difficulty inherent in the undertaking its an accomplishment only modestly short of a miracle.The Avengers were first assembled by Marvel Comics in Avengers 1 back in September 1963 with the gang deciding to unite following some spirited scrapping between Iron Man and the Hulk. In Whedons re-telling the geometry of discord is considerably more complex Captain America bickers with Iron Man who bickers with Thor who bickers with the Hulk who bickers with Black Widow. Its like an episode of Desperate Housewives with repulsor rays. The only one not to join in the squabbling is Hawkeye (who goes by his street name of Clint Barton) and thats because hes genuinely trying to kill them all having been psychically enthralled by the villainous Loki.Loki as you may recall from the movie Thor is the scheming adoptive brother of that hero and like him an extraterrestrial who inspired Norse mythology and retains a decidedly retro--Im talking helmet-with-curved-horns retro--sense of fashion. As the movie begins Loki is stealing the Tesseract (a cube of infinite power that you may recall from Captain America The First Avenger) from S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury (whom you may recall from the aforementioned movies as well as two Iron Mans and a The Incredible Hulk). Lokis plan is essentially to go all Grand Inquisitor on the human race freeing them of the burden of freedom and offering his own rule in its place.It is to Whedons great credit that he manages to corral this herd of competing plotlines into something resembling coherence. The movies leading up to the Avengers were widely divergent in tone and even genre in particular the intergalactic antics of Thor and the pulpy throwback heroics of Captain America. But Whedon turns these inherent tensions to his advantage making a film that itself spans genres a superhero flick yes but one that also dabbles in alien invasion and Mission Impossible-style superspydom. Indeed the fact that the characters hail from such radically different universes ultimately helps imbue them with well character the old-fashioned grit of Captain America the aloof nobility of Thor the self-loving charm of billionaire Tony Stark (a.k.a. Iron Man) and the twitchy discomfort of Bruce Banner ever at risk of inflating into the worlds least jolly green giant. Nor does Whedon skimp on his array of non-super-powered S.H.I.E.L.D. agents the wounded guile of Natasha Romanoff (sometimes known as Black Widow) the solitary sniperhood of Clint Barton the cigar- and scene-chewing gruffness of Nick Fury the quiet decency of Phil Coulson.

Yes it all ends as it must with a massive alien assault upon New York City and there are the requisite battles and blow-ups along the way. But silly as it may sound The Avengers is to a surprising degree an experiment in social chemistry. The cast is excellent down the line and plays well together even--perhaps especially--when their characters dont Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Scarlett Johansson (whose Black Widow is far more interesting than she was in Iron Man 2) Jeremy Renner Samuel L. Jackson Clark Gregg. It would seem unfair to single out any of the heroes--okay fine Downey is customarily terrific--but I have no such qualms about Tom Hiddlestons Loki who elevates lithe Eurotrash sneeriness to an art form. (His eventual comeuppance is one of the most crowd-pleasing onscreen moments in years.)But ultimately it all comes back to Whedon his clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled; his unexpected knack for action choreography; his funny tender immaculately constructed script (from a story he co-wrote with Zak Penn). I dont think Im giving anything away by revealing that the picture ends with Loki locked up for years. If Marvel has a lick of sense theyll do the same with Whedon.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

After Khizr Khan spoke politicians and commentators on most networks said they were moved humbled inspired choked up. (Commentators on Fox did not say these things because their coverage cut away from the Khans for Brit Hume and Megyn Kelly plus a Benghazi ad.) Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Gary Cameron / Reuters Trump Time Capsule 62 A Man Who Can Be Baited With a Tweet James Fallows None Last night in her overall very successful acceptance speech Hillary Clinton said with ruthless precision about her opponent Ask yourself Does Donald Trump have the temperament to be Commander-in-Chief? Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

It smashes and dashes smirks and winks passes the time and yet MAKES YOU THINK. Its a spectacle in the grandest sense of the word a notable counterpoint to ""gritty realism"" and a feather in director Joss Whedons cap. Legions of Browncoats have been trying to get this guy over for years if this doesnt work well have to resort to increasingly desperate measures. Dont tempt us. That said the first forty five minutes drag and this cant be swept under the rug even if we want to slumber party with Joss. Theres an awful lot of expository set-up that doesnt serve the viewing audience well. Who cares where Black Widow is from and what does the evil guys back-story matter to a person who has shown up on the scene primed and looking for action? This is the dangerous paradigm that the (admittedly genius) modern Batman films have foisted upon us - that superhero movies need to conform to the narrative tropes of traditional dramas. Telling a story makes sense only if you have a story to tell. Otherwise what are we doing here fellas? Checking a few boxes so the studio can say ""we tried really hard"" isnt a life skill. Lets get down to business immediately gimme HulkIronManCapAmericaThor now please thanks. Still these are small complaints and 90 percent of a good movie when mixed with 10 percent of a legitimately great movie are worthy of adulation. Downey Jr. makes us remember why his Iron Man character is so compelling hes huge comic relief throughout. Mark Ruffalos Hulk is a delight hes a man constantly on the edge of a delicious rage blackout. Thor and Captain America? Egh I wasnt a huge fan of their origin stories but they both acquit themselves well with better material here. Which brings us nicely to the main selling point of The Avengers. Its very fun. Thematically the film bounces around like a lotto ball but when gallows humor is employed against big action pieces it feels for a moment like the reason movies were invented. Festive escapism laced with comedy huge and blustery and demanding to be taken to dinner. One-liners like ""His brain is a bag full of cats"" and ""an intelligence organization that fears intelligence is not awesome"" carry the day. Furthermore even though Scar-Jos Widow backstory wasnt needed shes otherwise strong bringing a much needed female presence to the team. Worthy too is Sam Jackson though hes asked to convey most of the weighty material he comes through with competence. And then theres the action. Lord have mercy there are scenes in The Avengers that flat out whistle. The strongest aspect of comic book action is though it is (generally) encapsulated in a frame it doesnt need to conform to the physics of reality. So too The Avengers movie which fluidly blends CGI and ambition to output something not quite of this world. When the shot goes from The Hulk to Cap to Iron Man to Thor to Black Widow to Hawkeye ... and back again well youve convinced me that there are still a few angles out there that havent been beaten into the ground. Of those angles the film uses them in a far more intimate manner than were used to with summer fare to the films credit. Overall this is a film well worth your time and there are a few minutes here that are as fun as anything youll watch this year (WAIT for The Hulks moment with gleeful anticipation). I didnt stay for the end credits scene because ""why?"" and I think the Marvel franchise is going to have a rough time going solo after this massive effort. Still quibbles aside this one truly sings along with a joyful purpose.

Media San Francisco Chronicle Marvels The Avengers Action-adventure. Directed by Joss Whedon. Starring Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans and Samuel Jackson. (PG-13. 142 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) After four years five previous films and countless hours of waiting watching getting teased and sorting through backstories its finally here ""Marvels The Avengers"" the mother of all big-budget comic adaptations and the stereoscopic supergroup of superhero movies. As such it has no right to be this good. A 3-D movie featuring not one not two but six brilliant and/or ludicrously muscled protagonists fighting to defend Planet Earth from a Nordic god in a snit has no right to be anything but confusing ridiculous and generally devoid of simple human affect. And yet its none of those things. Instead Joss Whedons delicious ode to the Marvel universe boasts clarity conviction and characters who live and breathe. There are moments of genuine pathos genuine humor genuine surprise. As much as the film adheres to the strictures of the standard comic-book movie it also pops with a knowing loving Whedon-world jokiness that keeps everything barreling along.

Everyone wants it. And thats pretty much all you need to know about the plot. Whedon a pop-genre magician best known for ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a master of viewer manipulation - because he never gives up his own seat in the crowd. ""The Avengers"" does what we expect it to do. Its 3-D-converted visuals look mighty fine and it racks up a goodly amount of photogenic property damage as the story progresses.

Starring Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Scarlett Johansson Jeremy Renner Tom Hiddleston Stellan Skarsgard Samuel L. Jackson Director Joss Whedon Running time 223 Release Opened May 4 2012  Editorial Review Superheroes with team spiritBy Ann HornadayFriday May 4 2012There were ripples of anticipation - and some anxiety - when Marvel Enterprises announced that Joss Whedon would direct ""Marvels The Avengers"" the comic-book-movie to end all comic-book-movies featuring Iron Man Captain America the Hulk Black Widow Hawkeye and (did I miss anyone?) oh yes Thor. Whedon is known for his cerebral humor on display in his TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and most recently in the Web series ""Dr. Horribles Sing-Along Blog"" and the slasher send-up ""Cabin in the Woods."" He also has an unrepentant sentimental streak evidenced by his work on the first ""Toy Story"" movie. When it came to Whedon having his way with the rabidly beloved Marvel franchise fan-boys wondered (to borrow a phrase from the movie itself) Whats his play? Those faithful acolytes can breathe easy ""The Avengers"" has been executed with all the reverence the super-fans demand as well as the winking self-referential humor that has made it palatable for filmgoers disinclined to take a bunch of grown men dressed in spangles and spandex so very seriously. Whedon has adapted Stan Lees masterwork with skill and economy (if you can believe that given the films nearly 21 / 2-hour running time) if not with a surfeit of style. Most crucially hes enlisted terrific actors - some of them reprising already beloved roles a few earning their bones with scene-stealing performances - who function both as individual stars and a cohesive team. That balancing act is precisely whats called for in ""The Avengers"" which pivots largely on the tensions between super-heroes accustomed to being singular now forced to work in harness with one anothers often ungovernable strengths - and egos. When Robert Downey Jr. first played Tony Stark in ""Iron Man"" he brought a bracing dose of sophistication and flippant humor to what could have been a turgid exercise in overseriousness. In ""Iron Man 2"" he took the cockiness and entitlement of his character to a new not altogether welcome level of glib self-regard. In ""The Avengers"" he dials the swagger back to where viewers first fell for Stark the smart-but-silly playboy whose superpower may reside in a distinctive metal sheath but also lies in his ability to puncture even the most cherished pieties. That impudence doesnt sit well with Steve Rogers a.k.a. Captain America whom Chris Evans introduced last year as a refreshingly clean-cut avatar of retro wholesomeness and rock-ribbed values. Befuddled by Starks snark - not to mention references to Stephen Hawking and assorted 21st-century ephemera - he now looks more like a moralizing prig. The competitive psycho-dynamics between Stark and Rogers play out after theyre assembled by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and the peacekeeping agency S.H.I.E.L.D. when an interplanetary interloper named Loki (Tom Hiddleston) arrives on Earth and wreaks chaotic havoc in keeping with his name. If Stark doesnt immediately bond with the straight-laced Captain America he finds a more easy alliance with the brainy Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) the mellow modest genius scientist who to avoid getting angry and turning into what Stark calls an ""enormous green rage monster"" has been living in Calcutta and tending to the sick. From Eric Bana to Edward Norton the role of the Hulk has proved problematic over the years - often nicely played but not always in good movies. In ""The Avengers"" Ruffalo makes not just Banners nerdy glasses but the dirigible-size green suit his own effectively defining not just the films heart but the hyperbolic action that dominates its concussive climax. Another newcomer Jeremy Renner doesnt get as much screen time as Ruffalo. But as Hawkeye - whose complicated back story with Scarlett Johanssons Black Widow forms another fractious subplot - he proves that along with ""Mission Impossible"" and the ""Bourne"" films hes thoroughly capable of holding his own within a franchise juggernaut. The performances are so well-pitched in ""The Avengers"" meshing with such vividness and ease that its tempting to overpraise the good but not great movie that surrounds them. Probably wisely Whedon seems to have tamped down his instincts to play up irony and camp. Instead he focuses on simply making the characters legible and the story easy to follow from the Imax theater cheap seats - all the while interjecting witty lines and bits of business from Starks quippy asides to the literal punch lines Hulk delivers with a wordless grunt. By tacking so close to audience expectations Whedon has made a movie thats more efficient than inspired one that propels the series along and hits the necessary beats without breaking any substantive or stylistic ground. (""The Avengers"" was converted to 3-D in post-production which as in the case of ""Titanic"" does nothing to add or subtract from the experience.) Then again breaking ground is precisely the last thing fans want from movies that at their best play like elaborate pop-up versions of their source material with enough psychological complexity to keep things interesting. In this case that extra interior layer has to do with reconciling with ones own shadow material even at its most frightening and destructive. Laying waste to midtown Manhattan while tickling the dark side of his dualistic protagonists Whedon has positioned ""The Avengers"" exactly where it needs to be in order to keep spinning out in perpetuity. Bidding good-bye to at least one beloved character and saying hello to another in a tantalizing closing-credits hint he leaves us wanting more - which for now at least is undoubtedly the right play.

Take our movie trivia quiz Video The Avengers trailer Monitor Movie Guide Shortly after settling into ""The Avengers"" my initial thought was ""This is going to make a gazillion dollars."" I did not also have the corresponding thought ""Wow this is a great movie."" First things first. Still the film is good enough to keep all the Marvel Comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom.Theres a surplus of superheroes. If you dont care for Thor (Chris Hemsworth) or Captain America (Chris Evans) or the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) theres always Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Or if your tastes run to the dark side theres Loki (Tom Hiddleston) whose possession of the all-powerful tesseract cube is the main reason all the Marvels and Marvelettes are herewith assembled. Samuel L. Jacksons black-eye-patched S.H.I.E.L.D. master is supposed to be a good guy but since this is Samuel L. Jackson he plays him like a bad guy.Director-screenwriter Joss Whedon makes excellent use of 3-D and despite the overload of special effects and kabooms he doesnt turn the movie into a head-rattling endurance test a la Michael Bays ""Transformers"" series. It all goes on too long though Shapeliness is an alien life-form in these superhero movies. Its also set up for the guaranteed sequel this on top of the already impending individually gift- wrapped sequels for the likes of Thor and Iron Man and Captain America. Not to mention no-show Marvel fave Spider-Man who is also getting his own sequel. Recommended Think youre a film buff? Take our movie trivia quiz Its only a question of time before every movie will be required to contain at least one Marvel superhero.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post As titles go ""Marvels The Avengers"" is as unwieldy as Thors hammer would be for mere mortals. Even so director Joss Whedons take on the superhero hookup -- which brings together franchises ""Iron Man"" ""Hulk"" ""Thor"" and ""Captain America""as well as ""Black Widow"" and ""Hawkeye"" -- brilliantly exceeds the sum of its parts. Its two-plus hours of visual brawn unexpected heartbeats and welcome humor. After all it features Robert Downey Jr. Though the verbally agile actor who plays billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Manis hardly alone in delivering wet-towel snapping asides. Does ""The Avengers"" reinvent the genre? Not exactly. But it offers fans -- comic book habitue and moviegoer alike -- an epically enjoyable time that weaves character with action in ways that take serious and playful pleasure in pop culture ideas. Theres sibling rivalry and fealty. There are massive egos and lessons in humility. With its competing deities and heroes theres also a likely thesis topic for grad students. ""Superheroes and Monotheism"" anyone? The plot itself swirls around a dream of clean sustainable energy which at times feels as fantastical a reach in reality as any of these champions unusual talents are onscreen. A perfect chemistry was always going to be tricky. Just ask Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. Samuel L. Jackson portrays the head of the global peace-keeping organization. Hes the one who wrangles the crew. The story begins with an act of intergalactic thievery. Thors brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) arrives through a portal and steals an energy cube dubbed the Tesseract. Loki can subjugate others with the touch of a scepter. He starts with ace agent and archer Hawkeye and Prof. Erik Selvig (introduced in ""Thor"" and played by Stellan Skarsgard ). Note to the sequel leery While helpful you neednt have seen the solo flicks in order to follow or appreciate the action unfolding here. Still theres a load of wattage to finesse Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson Chris Evans Chris Hemsworth Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner portray the sextet. Perhaps thats why Whedon weaves the challenge of chemistry into the fabric of the story (conceived with Zak Penn). Can six superheroes accustomed to going it alone unite to save the world from a very embittered bro? A great deal of the early fun comes from watching the bumpy brawling meet-and-greets especially between Thor Iron Man and Captain America. What different mindsets these guys have Stark is the charismatic corporate egotist; Thor (Hemsworth) is a god increasingly fond of his human wards; Capt. America (Chris Evans) is arguably the most human among them. Contrary to the sports adage there turns out to be six Is in this team. Add Clark Greggs starched agent Coulson and Furys second the efficient whipsmart Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) and youve got a personality for nearly every taste. Need more seasoning still? Gwyneth Paltrow does tart work as Pepper Potts. Ruffalo take his place as the third recent incarnation of Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk. The dreamy-eyed curly haired actor so good in indies (""The Kids are All Right"")has often appeared uncomfortable in more studio endeavors. Whedon makes good use of that hangdog ambivalence. Banner reads as quietly racked ever wary of situations that may set him off and transform him into the volatile green giant. Among the best surprises here is Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Leave it to Whedon creator of Buffy slayer of vampires to give us a heroine who could be the rightful descendent of a different Avenger Emma Peel. That said Whedon and cinematographer Seamus McGarvey owe a debt to Jean-Luc Godards ""Contempt"" because they exhibit anything but disregard toward Black Widows posterior which gets the Brigitte Bardot treatment. What however would a superhero flick be with other special effects and a wave-after-wave action finale? In addition to Starks mad costume changes there are amazingly concocted vessels that move from sea to air An enemy one undulates like a metal koi in a pond of air above Manhattan. For a spell the glut of superhero movies seemed to treat the folk being saved as an afterthought because they were so busy psychoanalyzing the heroes. Even here Whedon and his FX whizzes succeed melding spectacle and at-times-flawed superheroes with the all-to-human. One of the most heroic acts in the film belongs to a regular albeit dedicated guy. Its a sacrifice there to remind us as we head out the multiplex doors ""Thats us people thats us.""

By Dana Stevens Marvels Avengers assemble to take on Loki Still by Zade Rosenthal/Marvel Studios/Paramount Pictures. After youve seen The Avengers come back and listen to our Spoiler Special discussion of all the tasty tidbits Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. You can also click here to download the MP3 file or youll find this and dozens of other Spoiler Specials in our iTunes podcast feed here. ""The tesseract has awakened"" intones a James Earl Jones-by-way-of-Jeremy-Irons voice-over in the opening moments of Joss Whedons superhero hoedown The Avengers (Disney/Marvel). In the opening scene the object in question a small yet infinitely powerful bluish-white cube single-handedly destroys a vast top-secret government laboratory known as the Dark Energy Division (which before it imploded must have been a cool place to say you worked. I may print up business cards with ""Dark Energy Division"" below my name). Advertisement A tesseract awakened in my mind during those opening frames too a portal to another dimension in which Id already seen this movie which in turn led to an infinite regression of universes in which Id also already seen it. As a viewer I might just qualify myself as tired of the chokehold the comic-book blockbuster has on our culture; as a critic Im starting to feel something akin to defeated by it. If guys in tights and capes must dominate our summer movie screens until were all pushing walkers into the multiplex I guess Ill resign myself to watching--but what on earth is there left to say about them? Because The Avengers is directed and co-written by Whedon the quick-witted pop mythologist most famous for creating TVs Buffy the Vampire Slayer and because the cast includes a few actors known more for brains than brawn (Jeremy Renner Mark Ruffalo Robert Downey Jr.) it does manage to feel a cut above the average superhero movie with the odd clever sight gag or sharp bit of banter. But theres only so much Whedon can do to make The Avengers his own; helming a project this size with a budget that makes global success an absolute necessity must be like docking an aircraft carrier. In fact an aircraft carrier of sorts--a vast floating military base with the ability to make itself invisible--provides the setting for much of The Avengers. There Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) a kind of superhero head-hunter gathers together his band of differently abled world-savers. Some like Iron Man (Downey) Captain America (Chris Evans) and the Hulk (Ruffalo) are mortal men whove gained extraordinary powers either through an accident of fate or the force of their own will. Others like the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are more like super-spies than superheroes black-ops specialists with highly developed fighting skills but no special powers. And at least one Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is a demigod from outer space. The same goes for Thors brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who as the movie begins escapes from exile to come to earth and enslave all humanity for no other reason than he feels like it. The capriciousness of Lokis motivation--in one scene he forces a crowd of German opera-goers to kneel before him just to prove that mankinds belief in freedom is only an illusion--makes him an appealingly mercurial villain greeting the chaos he wreaks not with a doomy glower but with an almost mischievous smile. Each of the Avengers too gets his or her small moments of character development. Iron Mans self-satisfied alter ego Tony Stark must overcome his narcissism to serve the larger cause; Thor must get over his snobbish reluctance to fight alongside mere mortals; and in the best-drawn character arc Bruce Banner aka the Hulk must come to terms with his inner green rage monster whom he refers to only obliquely as ""the other guy."" Above I called The Avengers a ""superhero hoedown""; it might more accurately be described as the opening-night cocktail party at a corporate superhero retreat. Theres a lot of competitive wisecracking and jockeying for status among the assembled luminaries. Some of this dialogue especially in the scenes of pseudoscientific one-upmanship between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner is quite funny (though a completely nonverbal moment between Hulk and Thor provides the movies biggest laugh which I wont spoil here). And the actors playing the Avengers (as well as some of their non-super helpmates including Gwyneth Paltrow as Iron Mans lady friend Pepper Potts and Clark Gregg as the loyal Agent Coulson) are such charismatic company that it comes as something of a disappointment each time the kibitzing gives way to crime-fighting with long breaks for spectacular (and often spectacularly dull) CGI-enhanced action set pieces including the climactic invasion of New York City by semi-organic robot reptiles. Because it pulls off the tricky feat of combining multiple pre-existing Marvel franchises into a reasonably entertaining and tonally coherent whole The Avengers (which has already set the machinery in place for its sequel with an end-credits teaser) will likely be hailed as a kind of thinking fans superhero film the way Whedons recent Cabin in the Woods functioned as both a horror movie and a critique of same. But a colossally scaled blockbuster like The Avengers lacks both the agility and the motivation to question its reason for existence. Its primary purpose is not to explore or subvert the superhero movie but to lay the groundwork for more of them (Ruffalo who arguably steals the movie as the rumpled reluctant Banner/Hulk has just signed on for a six-movie deal.) The tesseract crisis may have been resolved by the end of The Avengers but rest assured the time-space portal will be opening again by the summer of 2013 sucking viewers into theaters with the inexorable force of a black hole.

(Video Walt Disney Pictures) By Joe Morgenstern Updated May 4 2012 1004 a.m. ET What if Marvel gave a party and everybody came? Thats the organizing principle of ""The Avengers"" the much-anticipated hugely hyped immensely expensive and fitfully enjoyable (with an asterisk) convocation of comic book superheroes in which Iron Man Captain America the Incredible Hulk Thor Black Widow and Hawkeye team up to save the world. Ill explain the asterisk later. First let me note the magnitude of the event for the movies fan base versus the oddity of the mash-up--a slow start a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen-it-all-in-""Transformers"" to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown Manhattan climax. (Joss Whedon directed from a script he wrote with Zak Penn.) The star is Robert Downey Jr. His Iron Man is certainly a team player but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers a character of established sophistication--the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark a sharp-tongued man of the world--and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony. (He was much better in the first ""Iron Man"" but hes quite good here.) ""The Avengers"" which takes place in murky darkness for the first half-hour or so begins to lighten up figuratively if not literally only when Iron Man appears and we see on the lips of the man inside the red robotic rig a faint smile that says ""this is going to be fun."" The fun in seeing his teammates lies mostly in watching them in action although they quarrel comically among themselves at the outset like superdivas ""Were not a team"" Mark Ruffalos Bruce Banner says ""were a time bomb."" Share Your Photos Going to see ""The Avengers""? We want to feature your photos of fans in costume. Email us at yourphotoswsj.com or share on Twitter and Instagram with the hashtag avengersWSJ. Mr. Ruffalo as the anger-plagued scientist previously played by Edward Norton makes a point of keeping Banners emotions at a simmer lest Banner turn into the raging Hulk but the point is overdone in the name of underdoing and the result is blandness. Its easy to like Chris Evans as Captain America; likability is the retro-heros shield against contempo-hip. Chris Hemsworths Thor is more than likable; the demigod is touching in his attachment to his trusty hammer. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow fill out the sextet without adding much pizazz; Black Widow spends lots of time looking puzzled or confused. Tom Hiddleston is the villainous Loki determined to steal a potential source of unlimited energy. The cast includes Samuel L. Jackson (in lower-energy mode) as Nick Fury Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson and Gwyneth Paltrow whose Pepper Potts makes a brief appearance and then toward the end an even briefer reappearance that plays like an afterthought. What passes for a plot is simple enough even if frequent references to the characters back stories may leave you feeling that you missed a prescreening plot briefing. At first the Avengers are hard put to avenge anything because theyre outnumbered and outgunned by Lokis extraterrestrial army. ""Stark we need a plan"" Captain America says. ""I have a plan"" Stark replies brightly. ""Attack."" Attack they do energetically and episodically in their individual styles. Still it says something about the action--and the nature of action movies--that the wittiest moment comes when Stark says ""Hulk smash"" and the greatest satisfaction involves watching the green guy smash everything in sight as well as fling Loki around like a limp rag doll. More Avengers The Secret Agent Behind ""The Avengers"" Can You Really Get As Big As The Hulk? Mark Ruffalo on what ""The Avengers"" Says About America ""The Avengers"" Leads IMAX Parade ""Avengers"" 101 Now about that asterisk. I saw ""The Avengers"" in 3-D at a screening in Hollywood at the ArcLight a multiplex known for excellent projection. As soon as the opening credits hit the screen it was obvious that something was wrong; the images were dim and badly out of register. I should have known that the problem was a dead battery in my glasses since the same thing had happened--in a different theater--during last years disastrous screening of ""Clash of the Titans."" Instead I sat there stewing with frustration and assuming the projection was to blame since a couple of friends whod come with me were having the same problem. One of them went out to complain but nothing happened. A few minutes later he went out again and returned with replacement glasses for himself his wife and me. Someone had told him the glasses were the culprit but those batteries were dead too. The third try did the trick; he passed out three pairs of glasses that worked. By then though Id been distracted for most of the first act and felt more empathy than I would have preferred for Bruce Banners problems with anger management. Thats the main reason Im recounting this here. The technical screw-up was so upsetting that it may have skewed my judgment about the movie as a whole. I think I settled down but I cant be sure and I cant omit mention of the problem from my review. The other reason has to do with the status of theatrical exhibitors as the weakest link in the 3-D process. (Some theaters have already been caught reducing light levels on the screen to extend the life of expensive projector lamps.) What happened to me and others at the ArcLight the other night was the height of absurdity. Here we were watching a production that cost somewhere in the neighborhood of a quarter-billion dollars. Yet our enjoyment was compromised by button batteries that cant cost more than a buck a pop. And we were an invited audience privileged to see an advance screening not moviegoers paying hefty premiums for their 3-D experience. I shudder to think what they see. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Lets stipulate that older moviegoers are underserved to the point of starvation by a youth-obsessed entertainment industry. Yet theyre ill-served by this story of British retirees traveling to India to spend their sunset years in a retirement hotel thats supposedly as beautiful as it is inexpensive. The hotel turns out to be a ramshackle disappointment where almost nothing works as advertised. The same goes for the movie even though the cast includes some of the best English actors of our time--Judi Dench Bill Nighy Tom Wilkinson and Maggie Smith. Watch a clip from ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" starring Judi Dench and Bill Nighy. (Video Fox Searchlight) Theyre stuck with a script by Ol Parker thats stuffed with contrivance and cliche and doggedly repetitive as it tracks its characters efforts to find new love and adapt to new surroundings. When a genuinely dramatic encounter takes place--it involves Graham Dashwood a retired judge played by Mr. Wilkinson and its the movies only moment of genuine drama--the camera perversely pulls back to a respectful distance. We see next to nothing of the encounter and hear nothing at all until later when Graham tells someone else about it. Lets also stipulate that Mr. Nighy is one of the great comic actors of any time. Here however hes a glum presence in a role of bleak passivity. Ms. Smith spends most of her screen time in a wheelchair complaining nastily about everything under the Jaipur sun. Dev Patel has been encouraged or allowed by the director John Madden to overact wildly and wave his arms grotesquely as the hotels desperate young proprietor. Only Ms. Dench gets to play a scene worthy of her gifts. Her character Evelyn Greenslade has gone out and hustled herself a job at an Indian call center; suddenly shes plunged into the witty give and take of teaching a young Indian woman how to keep a client on the line. The scene is about listening well thinking quickly and responding creatively. Unlike the rest of this inert film its alive. First Position Watch a clip from the documentary First Position which follows six young ballet dancers as they prepare for one of the worlds most prestigious ballet competitions. (Video Sundance Select) Bess Kargmans debut documentary is a marvelous way to spend 94 minutes provided youre willing to spend them with your heart in your mouth. The subject is young dancers seeking awards validation and elite contracts in a ballet competition called the Youth America Grand Prix which holds its final round in Manhattan. In structure the film is a real-life ""Billy Elliot"" but the familiar formula doesnt exclude breathtaking surprises. Beneath the jetes and bleeding feet ""First Position"" is about toughness of mind as much as visions of beauty. In one case its about a transformation so profound as to be unfathomable. ENLARGE Rebecca Houseknecht. at center in First Position. Sundance Selects That distinction belongs to Michaela DePrince. A black war orphan from Sierra Leone she was adopted at the age of four and brought into a very large very white New Jersey family. When she recalls the horrors of her first four years she does so matter-of-factly ""Everywhere you looked you saw someone die...one time I tried to save my teacher but they just came and cut her arms and legs off."" Michaelas arms and legs are strong; so is her compact body. What she wants might seem out of reach for a young woman of her specific physique--""to be a delicate black dancer who does ballet."" Yet delicacy is in the mind and muscles of the dancer and Michaela has already proved that nothing is beyond her reach. ENLARGE From the same film Michaela DePrince and director Bess Kargman. Sundance Selects Ms. Kargmans strategy is straightforward--follow six contestants as they make their way through the semifinals and the finals where everything theyve learned everything theyve worked for and everything they can do must be distilled into a few fleeting moments on stage. There are crushing failures of course but also thrilling successes. In one of those success stories the camera follows a contestant to London where a scholarship awaits at the Royal Ballet and where it is noted in passing two of the ballet companys adjacent buildings are connected by an aerial passageway called the Bridge of Aspiration. Everyone in the film has come to such a bridge and everyone has crossed it. Here You must be willing to give yourself to Braden Kings debut feature a slow meandering and sumptuously photographed road trip combined with an intimate love story. I gave and I got. A lot. Watch a clip from ""Here"" starring Ben Foster Peter Coyote and Lubna Azabal. (Video Strand Releasing) The setting is Armenia where Will an American mapmaker played by Ben Foster meets Gadarine an expatriate photographer. Shes played by Lubna Azabal the actress who gave a glorious grand-operatic performance in ""Incendies."" Ms. Azabal is much more restrained in ""Here"" but extraordinary all the same. And Mr. Foster is fine in an inward way that defines his character. Will works for a satellite-mapping company. Solitary in nature and obsessed by precision he connects satellite images to the right places on the ground. Gadarine makes images too but theyre filled with faces and life and they tell human stories. ENLARGE Ben Foster and Lubna Azabal in Here Strand Releasing In other words two people who are polar opposites when it comes to mapping their worlds. Inevitably and poetically one approach gives way to the other. I wont say which trumps which but I can tell you that Gadarine doesnt end up working for Google Earth and that the filmmaker Mr. King has a gift for telling a story through meditative images. (Lol Crawley did the cinematography.) ""Here"" is intentionally underdramatized and occasionally sententious but intensely felt. Whenever Will and Gadarene touch they are truly touched. 2 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Walt Disney Pictures Marvels The Avengers Director Joss Whedon Genre Action Adventure Running Time 142 minutes Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout and a mild drug reference With Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Chris Hemsworth Watch Clips From Marvels The Avengers - Fight In The Forest Fight In The Forest Credit Walt Disney Pictures From Marvels The Avengers - Avengers Avengers Credit Walt Disney Pictures From Marvels The Avengers - Desperate Desperate Credit Walt Disney Pictures That crashing sound youll hear emanating from cineplexes this weekend will be the sound of comic-book superheroes smashing box-office records. Actually the smashing started last weekend when Marvels The Avengers opened in 39 territories around the world scooping up a cool 178 million in three days. And with legions of fans having already bought advance tickets in the U.S. its a pretty sure bet the box-office bonanza will continue as the film opens in more than 4000 North American theaters. Fans certainly wont be disappointed but neither are they likely to be terribly surprised by Joss Whedons enjoyably zingy genre flick. The banter has zip the effects are fun the climactic battle is decently spectacular and if the 3-D is mostly expendable there are a few scenes where it adds a nice kick. That said the plot is strictly standard-issue superhero stuff the Earths in peril when Norse demi-god Loki (Tom Hilddleston reprising his role as Thors neer-do-well quasi-sibling) steals a glowing blue cube (the Tesseract) that offers the planet unlimited power -- but has the unfortunate side effect of opening a wormhole through which alien invaders can pop. This being the sort of thing S.H.I.E.L.D. was set up to foil the secret agencys superhero-wrangler Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) gathers his brood of caped-or-otherwise-flamboyantly-attired heroes. Theres Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Captain America (Chris Evans) the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) plus a couple of superpower-challenged assassins whove not had their own movies (yet) ace archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and martial-arts tyro Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Once theyre all in place Fury announces ""War has started and were hopelessly outgunned."" To which the only possible reaction has to be ""Oh spare me ... our guys have a hammer exploding arrows a shield broad shoulders -- howre they gonna be underdogs in this fight?"" There is a problem though. These folks dont really play well with others. So turning them into an actual team will take time -- time that director Joss Whedon fills with the kind of one-on-one matchups fanboys usually only dream about. Irresistible hammer meets immovable shield. Snarky billionaire taunts guy whos trying to stay calm. Who do you thinkd win a fair fight? Thor? Iron Man? Hulk? Lets go find a mountaintop and break some trees. i S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) appeared in earlier Marvel movies only in cameos but he takes on a central role as he brings the Avengers together. Walt Disney Pictures hide caption toggle caption Walt Disney Pictures S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) appeared in earlier Marvel movies only in cameos but he takes on a central role as he brings the Avengers together. Walt Disney Pictures After that its mostly a matter of getting everyone assembled on what I guess youd have to call a stealth heli-carrier and marking time till a doozy of a final showdown. Whedon orders up a lot of quips -- some explosive laughs actually -- and so that you can still enjoy the picture if youre over 15 he makes sure that all his stars get to shine in moments without digital effects. Considering what a 3-D traffic jam The Avengers couldve been with six heroes in spandex -- plus big-name hangers-on from Stan Lee to Gwyneth Paltrow -- its impressive that the filmmaker still found time to say let Ruffalo be quirkily understated as the latest in a line of Hulks. All of this of course is leading to a bone-crunching building-shattering giant-eel-spaceship-eviscerating showdown that lays waste to much of Manhattan looks reeeeeeeally cool and sets up what will doubtless be Marvel superhero sequels too numerous to count. Cant say The Avengers makes me look forward to seeing any of its heroes flying solo again but it does establish that in smaller doses even the most annoying Type A personalities can be amusing. As a just-released trailer for the last third of Christopher Nolans Dark Knight trilogy reminds us a caped-crusader movie can aspire to greater things. But nobody says it has to and Joss Whedon just wants The Avengers to be fun. Which it is.

Now playing Movie showtimes buy tickets and more Beneath the garish costumes and day-saving deeds modern movie superheroes tend to be a pretty ornery and dysfunctional lot. Taken individually -- say the brooding tortured soul we know as the Dark Knight -- they get downright gloomy.Throw the right bunch together as in The Avengers and the colliding egos are a lot more fun than all the requisite combat and mayhem. These guys are anything but selfless and thats the key to this loud expensive but ultimately quite charming Marvel franchise mash-up.The Avengers has been percolating over the past few years as each major player received his own (frequently tedious) starring vehicle. Now they all have to play nice to save the world. Consider it an exercise in team building like a contentious corporate retreat with a lot of explosions.And what brings together Iron Man Captain America The Hulk Thor Black Widow and Hawkeye? Why impending Armageddon of course. Thors black-sheep brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston fresh off playing F. Scott Fitzgerald in Midnight in Paris old chap) has laid his hands on an all-powerful energy source called the Tesseract. He doesnt plan to charge up his iPhone with it. In Kiss Me Deadly terms the Tesseract is the great whatsit an apocalyptic yet almost irrelevant gizmo that keeps the plot moving.The best parts of The Avengers bear the fingerprints of director co-writer and fanboy god Joss Whedon who conceived the film as a Dirty Dozen-style homage to the assemblage of mismatched parts. Whedon knows how to be self-aware without getting overly cute about it. He has fun highlighting each characters neurosis and knows which personalities clash to greatest effect. (Old-school Captain America and narcissistic Iron Man not the best of buddies.)Robert Downey Jr. the man in the iron suit and Mark Ruffalo by far the best Bruce ""The Hulk"" Banner to hit the big screen bring the most acting chops but none of the main players is bad. The admittedly impressive final act which turns New York into an urban battleground has plenty to ooh and aah at.Its also the only time when the movies brain shuts down and reverts to that unfortunate action movie staple the overextended climax. The wonderful tension that drives these costumed misfits gets pummeled along with the rest of Manhattan.The Avengers relies on too many old tricks to really transcend the genre. But it plays well enough with others to emerge as an exemplary specimen.THE AVENGERS(B+) Directed by Joss Whedon. Rated PG-13 (action violence). 142 mins.

Every now and then director Joss Whedon (Serenity) executes a quirky camera set-up to assert that the film was created by him and not a team of marketing executives. Of the star-studded cast only Mark Ruffalo (playing Bruce Banner) and Robert Downey Jr. (as Iron Man) bring any personality to the place-holder dialogue.

Biff Bam BoringThis middling movie is the zero sum of overwhelming expectations divided by underwhelming execution. ""The Avengers"" isnt bad by any stretch of the imagination but neither is it especially good because well it doesnt have any stretch of the imagination. From the opening voice-over about dark forces gathering in the universe to the final smackdown in Manhattan weve seen it all a dozen times before including in the movies from which this Marvel Comics all-star team was assembled.The dark forces are from Asgard the home planet of crash-landed demigod Thor (Chris Hemsworth). His evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) steals a cube of limitless energy called the Tesseract from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who rounds up a group of superheroes to retrieve it. The team includes playboy industrialist Tony Stark aka Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.); time-traveling supersoldier Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans); and anger-impaired professor Bruce Banner aka the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo new to the role) who is lured from his Calcutta hideaway by seductress Natalia Romanova aka the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). Yet Loki has a super sidekick of his own hypnotized sharpshooter Clint Barton AKA Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).Thats a lot of subplots to juggle and director Joss Whedon gives almost everyone (sorry Hawkeye) a spotlight moment. Downey adds a welcome whiff of humanity to his tiresome hotshot routine Evans gives the movie a moral center and Ruffalo is the best of the three recent Hulks. A machine this proficient is guaranteed to reap about a gazillion dollars yet even fanboys will be hard-pressed to cite a memorable scene or even a line of dialogue from the table-setting first hour of this overlong movie. Weak wisecracks hide the lack of real chemistry between the characters and this is yet another summer movie where pseudo 3-D effects were added after the fact. Its also another superhero movie in which a major city gets leveled but we dont see a single civilian casualty. Granted the fiery finale is good enough to leave the legions smiling. But when a movie is expected to lift an entire industry ""good enough"" shouldnt be good enough.""The Avengers""Two and a half stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 222  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence Find theaters and showtimes for The Avengers May 2 2012 (...)

Their return is guaranteed also because audiences have been eagerly anticipating this first all-hero extravaganza for years. The wait was worth it.Theyve all been around the blockbuster block individually or in smaller combinations. Now this group of a half-dozen heroic comic-book characters fights a dastardly villain on land air and into outer space. But they also amusingly tussle among themselves. Its that last squabbling that makes for the most fun.STORY Avengers cast shoots for superhero spectacleMORE On Avengers set laughter is a powerful weaponMarvels The Avengers ( out of four PG-13 opens at select theaters at midnight nationwide Friday) offers maximum bang for moviegoing buck. Audiences are treated to the snarky wit of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) the unmanaged anger of the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) the patriotic derring-do of Captain America (Chris Evans) the hammer-wielding Norse justice of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) the sly fearlessness of Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and the fiendishness of arrow-wielding Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).Its essentially six movies in one which might account for the nearly 21/2 hour length. While its slow getting started The Avengers is a splashy superhero mash-up that should please breathless fanboys. It also has a broader appeal for mass audiences with its fast-paced comic banter and exhilarating action sequences under the capable helm of director/co-writer/unabashed fan Joss Whedon.About the movieMarvels The Avengers out of fourStars Robert Downey Jr. Scarlett Johansson Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Tom Hiddleston Samuel L. Jackson Jeremy Renner Gwyneth Paltrow Director Joss WhedonDistributor Walt Disney Pictures Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout and a mild drug reference Running time 2 hours 22 minutes Opens at select theaters at midnight nationwide FridayWhedon weaves a story that allows each of the heroes to do what they do best. And while they may not have exactly equal time audiences get enough of each to feel satisfied but not sated. Clever work indeed.Downeys playboy millionaire/scientist Tony Stark (Iron Man) verbally jousts with straight-arrow Steve Rogers (Captain America) whose earnestness is delivered pitch-perfectly by Evans. Not surprisingly Downey gets the funniest lines. On another planet he battles Hemsworths Thor who intones his stentorian dialogue with the superhero equivalent of a wink. Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk pulls off some of the best physical gags making for a much more fun Hulk after the last few disappointing incarnations.Clark Gregg as Nick Furys second-in-command Phil Coulson has some well-timed comic zingers in a plot that hinges on a power cube known as a tesseract and the megalomaniacal grab for it by the evil Loki (Tom Hiddleston) last seen as the jealous brother of Thor in last summers eponymous blockbuster.Whedon wisely gives the group the appeal of a comic ensemble so when the 3-D battles with alien armies grow numbingly familiar the breezy comic dialogue divvied up among the collective makes for a happy and welcome distraction.

O. SCOTTMAY 3 2012 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo From left Jeremy Renner Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson in ""The Avengers."" Credit Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Pictures Scientists estimate that we reached Peak Superhero in the summer of 2008 when ""The Dark Knight"" sucked the attention of every critic pundit and sentient moviegoer into its inky nexus. It is not as if the number of movies featuring troubled guys wearing costumes and fighting evil has diminished since then. Quite the contrary. But the genre though it is still in a period of commercial ascendancy has also entered a phase of imaginative decadence. (Do you really want to have an argument about this? If so put on your best oversize metal suit and wait for me at the top of the New York Times building. Ill be there as soon as I finish beta-testing my death ray. Apologies in advance to any commuters crushed by flying debris.) The latest evidence -- though it is unlikely to be the last with a new ""Spider-Man"" and another ""Dark Knight"" looming on the horizon -- is ""Marvels The Avengers.""You may occasionally encounter (as I have a few times in the past months) a walking relic of an earlier era of pop-cultural fandom who wonders if they have at last made another movie out of that fondly recalled British spy series from the 1960s. ""They"" have not and those poor souls who cherish old daydreams of Diana Rigg in leather will have to console themselves with images of Scarlett Johansson in a black bodysuit.So ""The Avengers"" which has been foreshadowed by post-credits teasers in (deep breath) ""Captain America"" ""Thor"" ""The Incredible Hulk"" (the one with Edward Norton) and both ""Iron Man"" pictures is not without its pleasures. Written and directed by Joss Whedon this movie revels in the individuality of its mighty mythical characters pinpointing insecurities that are amplified by superhuman power and catching sparks that fly when big rough-edged egos (and alter egos) collide. The best scenes are not the overblown skull-assaulting action sequences -- which add remarkably little that will be fresh or surprising to devotees of the ""Transformers"" franchise -- but the moments in between when the assembled heroes have the opportunity to brag banter flirt and bicker. Photo Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in ""The Avengers."" Credit Zade Rosenthal/Walt Disney Pictures The secret of ""The Avengers"" is that it is a snappy little dialogue comedy dressed up as something else that something else being a giant A.T.M. for Marvel and its new studio overlords the Walt Disney Company. At times -- when various members of a game and nimble cast amble in and out of the glassy metallic chambers of a massive flying aircraft carrier cracking wise rolling eyes and occasionally throwing a punch -- the movie has some of the easygoing charm of ""Rio Bravo"" Howard Hawkss great late western in which John Wayne Angie Dickinson Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson did a lot of talking on their way to a big and not-all-that-interesting shootout.The difference is that in keeping with the imperatives of global franchise entertainment the big shootout in ""The Avengers"" must be enormous of a scale and duration that obliterates everything else. A hole opens in the sky disgorging metallic warriors on Jet Skis and big snakey things that inflict serious digital damage on the Manhattan skyline. Before that there are similarly overdone combat sequences. None of them matches in cinematic wit or visceral surprise a sucker punch landed by the Hulk on Thors lantern jaw or a cartoonish smackdown delivered by that same angry green fellow on Loki Thors adoptive brother and this episodes main villain. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Loki (Tom Hiddleston) a disgraced Asgardian princeling with a spear and magic helmet is after the tesseract a glowing blue cube of pure energy. With the help of a couple of brainwashed turncoats Loki has pried it away from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) a world-government spymaster with a lot of semi-secret projects up his sleeve. He assembles a team to get it back consisting of the guys weve seen in the other movies (including Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson the seriess hardest-working nonsuperhero and its most reliable comic asset) as well as Ms. Johanssons Black Widow. Eventually Jeremy Renners Hawkeye joins up too mostly to glower and shoot a lot of arrows. Photo Robert Downey Jr. in ""The Avengers."" Credit Walt Disney Pictures Mr. Jackson with an eye patch and his well-practiced bellow is more master of ceremonies than mission commander and under his watch the Avengers indulge in some Rat Pack-y horsing around. Captain America (Chris Evans) is teased for being an out-of-touch old-timer Thor for being a longhaired deity from another planet. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is his usual mischievous playboy self distinguishable from Sherlock Holmes at this point thanks only to his accent and the brief presence of Gwyneth Paltrow in his penthouse. The newcomer -- and every intellectuals favorite comic-book-based movie character from now on -- is Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner a mopey hesitant genius who turns large and green when angry.""Im always angry"" he says at one point and while ""The Avengers"" is hardly worth raging about its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding hectic emptiness the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre. Mr. Whedons playful democratic pop sensibility is no match for the glowering authoritarianism that now defines Hollywoods comic-book universe. Some of the rebel spirit of Mr. Whedons early projects ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" creeps in around the edges but as detail and decoration rather than as the animating ethos.""I aim to misbehave"" Malcolm Reynolds famously said in ""Serenity."" But for all their maverick swagger the Avengers are dutiful corporate citizens serving a conveniently vague set of principles. Are they serving private interests big government their own vanity or what? It hardly matters because the true guiding spirit of their movie is Loki who promises to set the human race free from freedom and who can be counted on for a big show wherever he goes. In Germany he compels a crowd to kneel before him in mute terrified awe and ""The Avengers"" which recently opened there to huge box office returns expects a similarly submissive audience here at home. The price of entertainment is obedience.""Marvels The Avengers"" is rated PG-13. Blam. Splat. Kapow. Mostly bloodless.

And we crave guys in tights and capes green skin and clanking metal bringing it on in a big way -- and bickering among themselves while theyre bringing it on -- to save the scampering hordes of humanity. In The Avengers -- the Disney Studios/Marvel Comics marriage-made-in-box-office-heaven -- the superhero stars of Iron Man The Hulk Captain America and Thor come together to set things right when things go apocalyptically wrong. Plot Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the demonic adoptive brother of the Norse god of thunder hijacks the Tesseract a cosmic cube that serves as both a portal to other universes and a plot device of unlimited power -- the mega-McGuffin. Everybody wants it and whoever gets it will have the ability to run clean energy across the globe or run the globe ragged with tyranny. Directed by genre geek Joss Whedon whose pulp sensibilities worked magic on TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Serenity The Avengers is a slickly packaged effects-driven smashup. Watch it in 3-D if you feel the need to see the Mighty Thors hammer flyin at ya (and if you want to suffer the dimming effects of those cumbersome tinted glasses) but everyday 2-D on a decent-size screen with surround sound is really good enough. Good enough to watch Robert Downey Jr. deliver his knee-jerk wiseguy one-liners good enough to watch Scarlett Johansson clench her brow as she strides purposefully toward the camera in Ninja garb good enough to catch Mark Ruffalo the third actor in nine years to play the brainy Dr. Banner talking with trepidation about ""the other guy"" he shares psych-space with. So Loki (""I am burdened with glorious purpose"") gets hold of the Tesseract and hypnotizes SHIELD agent Clint Barton aka Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) while Lokis Asgardian sibling Thor (Chris Hemsworth) joins up with the rest of the Marvel crew -- including the ridiculously jut-jawed Captain America (Chris Evans) -- to hash out a plan. It is the ""Avengers Initiative"" and it is being run by espionage agency SHIELDs top gun Nick Fury. Samuel L. Jackson -- sporting an eye patch a Vandyke beard and an uncanny ability to deliver his lines as if they were straight from a comic books word balloons -- is Fury charged with assembling the misfit gang of turbocharged neurotics to figure out how to thwart the Norse nemesis. The figuring-out part dissolves into name-calling -- Downeys Ironic Man and Evans Captain America dont hit it off for one thing -- and then into a gigantic Transformers-esque free-for-all in and around New Yorks Grand Central Station where commuters are inconvenienced by Lokis legions. If these last 40 minutes or so of The Avengers evoke the real-life devastation of 9/11 this is probably inevitable whether or not its intentional Shots of the NYPD and National Guard rushing here and there as blazing office towers collapse and citizens flee . Its kind of hard not to trigger that connection. But I dont think Whedon is really going there. The chaos and carnage here is just a pumped-up take on a tradition that harks back to Godzilla and harks back of course to the Marvel comics from which all these heros originally sprang.

"Avengers review Joss Whedon saves the day - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movie review In The Avengers a Marvel-ous team Video The Avengers movie review Kenneth Turan reviews the new movie The Avengers starring Captain America Thor Iron Man Hulk Hawkeye Black Widow and Nick Fury. Kenneth Turan reviews the new movie The Avengers starring Captain America Thor Iron Man Hulk Hawkeye Black Widow and Nick Fury. Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""The Avengers""are here and resistance is futile. Even if youre frustrated by the relentless calculation of Marvel Studios plan for world cinema domination fed up by the shameless way the studio used several of its earlier at times pro forma superhero movies to promote this one even if you dont particularly like comic-book adaptations this film just might make a believer of you. Thats because just like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) the uber-calculating director of S.H.I.E.L.D. who calls on the Avengers when the fate of the world is at stake Marvel has gone to its own version of the A-team when the franchise needed it most. That would be Joss Whedon. PHOTOS The Avengers premiere As screenwriter sharer of story credit with Zak Penn and director Whedon is the key reason why this 220-million behemoth of a movie is smartly thought out and executed with verve and precision. It may be overly long at two hours 23 minutes but so much is going on you might not even notice. Whedons biggest success creating TVs ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" was nowhere near this scale. But he is a third-generation television writer who was nominated for an Oscar for co-writing""Toy Story"" and hes got an innate gift for bringing stories like this to life with the energy and intelligence that should be popular entertainments birthright but rarely is. For starters the films numerous action set pieces including a whopper of an alien invasion of Manhattan that was so enormous it had to be shot in Cleveland are crisply done with minimal dead time and few perfunctory elements. But what really makes the difference in ""The Avengers"" is the emphasis on character as the films storytelling core. Many of the superheroes including Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Captain America (Chris Evans) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) have had features of their own but both what they say and how they say it is a step up here. Because Whedons dialogue is less glib than the Marvel norm with lines written as if they meant something not to mention often being genuinely funny the total effect brings the film closer to the tone of the original 1960s books which revolutionized the comic world by presenting superheroes who were deeply involving troubled individuals. It is part of Whedons style here to throw the audience into the middle of the action then backtrack to bring viewers up to speed. ""The Avengers"" begins with some nefarious aliens gleefully writing Earths obituary (""The humans what can they do but burn?"") and the bad news that the Tesseract a tiny but enormously powerful extraterrestrial energy source has started to act up. That acting up opens a portal to the other side of space and who should arrive on our planet but the Norse god Loki (the exemplary Tom Hiddleston) up to no good. ""I am Loki of Asgard burdened with glorious purpose"" he says by way of introduction before killing everyone in sight and using his scepter to turn ace S.H.I.E.L.D. archer Clint Barton a.k.a. Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) into his brainwashed tool. Lokis goal as it turns out is to make a deal with those shadowy aliens and end up ruling we feeble earthlings a species he feels is ripe for the picking. ""The unspoken truth is that you yearn for subjugation you are made to be ruled"" is the way he puts it. What a diplomat. Talk like this causes Fury (whose organization is not called Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division for nothing) to declare that a state of war exists and mobilize agents like the deadly Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) into full combat mode. To save Earth Fury is fully aware his S.H.I.E.L.D. troops will have to be supplemented by a handful of superheroes he hopes will coalesce into a fighting machine called the Avengers. Which allows Whedon to enliven the film with some""Seven Samurai""-inspired sequences where legendary fighting heroes are importuned to join the cause. First asked is mild-mannered Bruce Banner now occupied doing good deeds in the slums of Calcutta but once known and feared as the Incredible Hulk. The doc is willing to help but is understandably worried about ""what happens if the other guy says no."" The talented Mark Ruffalo is the latest in a long line of Hulk portrayers and perhaps the best. Captain America asleep for 70 years and wondering why anyone bothered to wake him is also asked as is Lokis brother Thor and the ever-acerbic Tony Stark/Iron Man. He wears a Black Sabbath T-shirt and has a sarcastic attitude toward his would-be colleagues nicknaming Thor ""Point Break"" and noting that Banner has ""breathtaking anger management issues."" Stark cracking wise is just one example of the problem confronting S.H.I.E.L.D. As creatures of supreme ego the superheroes dont work and play well with others. More than that they genuinely dont like one another and hearing Captain America and Iron Man verbally rip into each other is pleasantly convincing and helps makes the hero-on-hero battles that periodically erupt all the more involving. If as ""The Avengers"" depressingly underlines comic-book movies are the ultimate expression of todays Hollywood zeitgeist the way say ""Gone With the Wind"" or""Casablanca""epitomized an earlier time its good to at least have them done this well. If you have to watch ""a handful of freaks isolated and unbalanced"" saving the planet for the umpteenth time you could do a whole lot worse. kenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies The Avengers (movie) Joss Whedon Toy Story (movie) Casablanca (movie) Academy Awards The Avengers Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-avengers-20120503,0,1815592.story?track=rss",200,marvel'stheavengers21,marvel'stheavengers,latimes

If you like ""Marvels The Avengers"" (theres almost nothing to dislike; its as close as a movie can come to the fantastical reality of a good comic book) stick around for the closing credits. By this point your grandfather knows to stick around for the scrap of preview awaiting the last disclaimers and thank-yous (the scrap is called an Easter egg). ""The Avengers"" puts the egg before most of the credits -- it just feels like the natural end of the movie.Yes getting the egg out of the way gets you out of the theater sooner (the movie runs about 21/2 hours). But it also invites honest appreciation for the hundreds and hundreds of technicians who bring off these extravaganzas - the effects and sound people; the folks who devise and design and build the props and costumes; the men and women who helped make the destruction of midtown Manhattan (by your standard cavalcade of shimmering reptilian evil) a ridiculous pleasure. Its tempting to envy the civilians watching Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man) and Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) flying around the neighborhood from a window of their skyscraper even after the Incredible Hulk barrels past all the cubicles and through the glass. We have 3-D glasses. Theyre actually there.So its truly gladdening to listen to actors like Downey Johansson Tom Hiddleston (Loki) Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury) Gwyneth Paltrow (Iron Mans lady-love and lifeline Pepper Potts) Mark Ruffalo (Dr. David Banner/the Hulk) and Clark Gregg (S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson) speak the banter and asides in Joss Whedons script which is tight and - by the measure of what tends to occur in a Marvel Comics title - perfectly logical. But its the craftspeople you want to hug. The reason we keep going to these movies is to experience what Ive always called the Saturday-afternoon high of taking in a comic book. You dont read them per se. You savor them - the succession of bright handsome frames the simmering pace of the plot the ideas. The great comic books made you want to be inside them. The great comic books were better than the movies. They could do what the technician couldnt.What weve seen since Richard Donners original ""Superman"" from 1978 is the steady closing of that gap. ""The Avengers"" is state-of-the-art in that sense. At some point in this movie the Hulk grabs a character by his leg and whips him into the floor like hes beating the dust out of a mat. This happens all the time in a comic - the defiance of physics. When it happens here it brings down the house - the movies can really do this now. This movie which Whedon also directed is full of these sorts of OMG set pieces. You dont need to be a ""comic-book person"" to find the set pieces exhilarating. But if you are such a person or a fan of the movies that comic books turn into ""The Avengers"" feels like the moment youve been waiting for. For me at least theres some irony in that. ""The Avengers"" evolved into a good series with the addition in the 1980s of some very strange characters and terrific writing. The incarnation of the group in the movie - Iron Man the Hulk Black Widow Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Captain America (Chris Evans) -- always felt like an incoherent shrinking of the Marvel universe.The movie is one of the few that makes a case for revisiting and rethinking its source material. Whedon makes the group make sense. The movies that were devoted to individual stars - Iron Man the Hulk Captain America Thor - were made in part as setups for this one which give side players like Jackson and Johansson much more to do. The story essentially has Nick Fury and the covert government agency - the S.H.I.E.L.D. - unite these characters to stop Thors prissy brother Loki from using a blue energy cube (the Tesseract) to open a portal for alien invaders to trash Earth.As plots go its standard. But Whedon clearly prides himself on adding some zing and zest to the bam and pow. This is a happily quotable movie (only a third of the good lines go to Downey) that wants to be cool without forcing the issue. There are well-constructed jokes about video games at work Shakespeare in the park weed and ""The Wizard of Oz."" There are also moments of elegance such as in an early sequence in which Captain America goes looking for Loki in Stuttgart while nothing but Schubert plays on the soundtrack.When Captain America brings his shield and Thor his hammer for a forest fight with Iron Man we have a deftly choreographed summit of three of Marvels most precious metals. And what music some of the actors make when they pronounce Asgard so that it sounds like a slur If theres a surprise in the casting its how well Ruffalo does with a part he has to share with the effects department. Unlike other movies about the Hulk this one manages to build comedy and suspense into the transition from gamma expert to green monster. He even has an amusing nude scene with Harry Dean Stanton.Not everyones been sufficiently deployed. Loki puts a spell on the characters played by Renner and Stellan Skarsgard (hes a scientist) that forces them to spend the movie with breath mints for pupils. And Cobie Smulders who plays Robin on ""How I Met Your Mother"" stands in a control deck looking eager for the other actors to say something meaningful to her. But Im relieved to report that for a film with this many moving parts it doesnt feel like a bunch of waiters are standing around eager to swoop in and refill your water glass. Its not overstaffed.Whedon passes along his joy for comic book lore and movie-going spectacle. Hes had his biggest success subverting genre television (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""; the beloved short-lived space opera ""Firefly"") and this movie operates with a smoothness that doesnt exceed the capabilities of its maker.The destruction of Manhattan doesnt produce the same pang of disgust that say Michael Bay does when he sets out to bring down anything. Bay is a far more ambitious filmmaker. When he obliterates a city he evokes the iconography of destructions so you think about the Third Reich or Sept. 11 and you remember the images. Whedons attempts to evoke historical morality as he does during that trip to Stuttgart feel callow.Whedon isnt a visionary - hes really not out to say anything about the world or even about himself. But where Bay is making movies for himself Whedon is making movies for people like him. Hes a kid in a comic-book store. I might not remember any of the sequences in ""The Avengers"" but Ill remember the rush. I dont need anything else.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Share Tweet People never know when theyre living in a golden age goes a commonplace bit of wisdom but that cant be true for fans of superhero movies. Since 2000 when Bryan Singer debuted an X-Men film that stayed true to the themes and characters of the best X-Men comics while satisfying all the requirements of a big summer blockbuster good-to-great superhero adaptations--and yes some truly lamentable ones--have arrived at a regular clip. Its not that worthy superhero films didnt exist before then. But even the most striking like Richard Donners Superman and Tim Burtons Batman films either winked at or took outrageous liberties with the source material or both. (To put things in perspective X-Men arrived just three years after this.) In recent years Marvel Studios has gone one step further trying to bring to the big screen not just the companys superhero stories but also the idea of a shared universe in which Iron Man Thor Captain America and others could team up. Built on the groundwork of The Incredible Hulk Captain America Thor and two Iron Man films The Avengers is the logical culmination of that work adapting Marvels long-running oft-changing team comic book in which the companys biggest heroes share space with colorful second-stringers as they save the world. Since making an Avengers movie requires lining up so many moving pieces in an orderly row its something of an accomplishment that The Avengers even exists. But beyond that logistical nightmare is the double agenda the film has to serve advancing the stories of the individual characters as begun in previous films while telling a coherent self-contained story. Factor in another wave of Marvel movies and an inevitable sequel and that agenda gets even more complicated. All of which raises the question Is there room for any movie within this Avengers movie? Decidedly yes. Written and directed by Buffy The Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon The Avengers is big but graceful carefully balancing small character moments with action scenes that stretch from the New York pavement to the sky and beyond. The film finds drama in the reluctant cooperation of teammates yoked together by the threat of a common enemy as well as in the terrifying shadows cast by giant space monsters as they descend from the heavens. Tasked with meeting the many requirements necessary for any Avengers movie to work Whedon checks off all the boxes then sets about creating new expectations for what a big superhero movie ought to be. In essence a getting-the-band-together story The Avengers opens by establishing a threat big enough to warrant the attention of the heaviest hitters of the superhero world. Still unhappy about falling into an abyss at the end of Thor Loki (Tom Hiddleston) has conspired with a group of aliens to take over the world with some help from The Tesseract the mysterious energy-producing cube thats been bouncing around the last few Marvel films. In the process of making his intentions clear he destroys a S.H.I.E.L.D. base and takes over the minds of two of its key operatives a scientific genius (Stellan Skarsgard reprising his Thor role) and freakishly gifted archer Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner). Understandably upset S.H.I.E.L.D. head Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sets about putting together a superteam first bringing in the espionage expert Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) then some less eager recruits Captain America (Chris Evans) Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and eventually super-scientist Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo)--whos laying low in order to keep his monstrous alter-ego The Hulk in check--and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who would like to save Earth sure but also has a personal grudge with Loki. Remarkably given that sprawling cast of characters everyone gets their due. Whedon picks up the action where Iron Man 2 Thor and Captain America left off continuing to develop the stories of each of those films heroes. Downeys Tony Stark remains driven by ego and genius always on the verge of overreaching while Hemsworth continues to navigate between two worlds. As a man out of time unsure of how he fits into the modern world or if he even wants to Evans shoulders even more of the drama becoming the heart of a film thats filled with heroics but also if sometimes too fleetingly concerned with the meaning of heroism. Fitting right in Ruffalos laidback Banner a characterization with echoes of the easy-living California dude he played in The Kids Are All Right Johanssons haunted superspy and Renner whose steely intensity alone makes it easy to forget the unlikelihood of an archer no matter how good being able to hold his own among superhumans. Not to mention major supporting roles played by Jackson Cobie Smulders as Jacksons chief lieutenant and Clark Gregg who steps into the spotlight after lurking in the shadows as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in previous Marvel films. Yet compelling as each character is in his or her own right the real pleasure comes from the unstable chemistry of putting them together. While Downey and Ruffalo bond immediately and unnervingly over their shared love of sciences outer limits others get along less immediately and less well. Thats partly because as in the comics they have no real business sharing space with one another. Characters created to star in disparate adventure tales about espionage science warfare monsters and mythology dont really belong in the same story. And yet also as in the comics they exist in a larger-than-life universe in which their stories can be joined together in service of the clashes between good and evil that overwhelm them individually. The Avengers makes the evil side of the equation seem suitably overwhelming. In action scenes that include a long setpiece aboard S.H.I.E.L.D.s airborne fortress and a Manhattan showdown that bounces from city streets to the tops of skyscrapers and back again (and features more shattered glass than a chandelier store run by Jerry Lewis) The Avengers throws at its heroes opponents who outnumber and outgun a team still learning the meaning of teamwork. The film also gives the bad guys an insidious agenda. The action looks impressive--even with the unnecessary addition of post-production 3D--but theyre made all the more chilling by early Hiddleston dialogue delivered with Shakespearean intensity about using humanitys innate distrust of its own freedom as a tool for his own purposes. Always skilled at mixing melees and metaphors Whedon turns Hiddlestons Norse trickster god into another in a line of Big Bads whose origins can be traced to the worst human impulses and hes made all the more effective by the glints of vulnerability and sympathy beneath the schemes and horns. Some of Whedons other creative impulses get pushed aside by the scale on which he has to work. Downey gets the lions share of the witty banter and anyone expecting the self-awareness and zigzag plotting of the directors other work might be disappointed by The Avengers heads-down forward charge. (Where The Cabin In The Woods offers a straight shot of Whedon The Avengers adds a mixer and garnish to make it go down easy.) But other recognizable Whedonisms arrive intact including a distrust of authority that extends to the ostensible good guys and an unfailing ability to switch between effervescent lightness and wrenching emotion. In other words The Avengers delivers and then some. Even the weakest of Marvel Studios films have felt like competent well-polished pieces of product. The Avengers is that yes but also a heartfelt exciting and thematically resonant piece of big-screen mythmaking likely to please superhero geeks and general audiences alike. Though just as Star Wars helped bring the dreams of science-fiction fans into the world at large in the 70s in the years since X-Men the distinction between fans and general audiences has gotten thinner and thinner. Maybe thats what happens in a golden age. For thoughts on and a place to discuss plot details not talked about in this review visit The Avengers Spoiler Space.

"Avengers movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The gangs all here in The Avengers  Chicago Tribune movie critic Michael Phillips picks 10 movies you should look forward to this summer. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune The culmination of everything ever written produced or imagined in the known universe or something like that""The Avengers""bunches together Iron Man Captain America The Hulk Thor the leather-clad assassin Black Widow the lethal archer Hawkeye and the superheroes one-eyed wrangler Nick Fury for 143 minutes of stylish mayhem in the service of defeating Thors malevolent brother the god Loki who hails from the interstellar world known as Asgard (access through wormhole only) and who yearns to conquer Earth with an all-powerful blue energy cube called the Tesseract.So is this Marvel Comics franchise alumni reunion a full-on Hulk smash? Financially yes most likely. (""The Avengers"" is already killing em overseas.) If the film is more solid and satisfying than terrific so be it. Cleverly writer-director Joss Whedon combines and recombines its various intramural rivalries. If you were a fan of two or three or more of the movies directly feeding into this one youre already planning on seeing ""The Avengers."" Seeing it in 2-D the movie played well enough. Catching it a second time this week in 3-D with a raucous eager crowd provided that little extra something that lifted the experience up a level. While 3-D isnt crucial to your engagement with ""The Avengers"" it helps. The Cinematographer Seamus McGarveys palette nice and bright compensates for the dimness factor that comes with putting on those ill-fitting glasses. Compare the scenes set on the planet Asgard in Whedons film with the early turgid chunks of director Kenneth Branaghs ""Thor"" and you have the difference between a sleekly burnished surface and murk.In this corner the familiar faces. Top-billed and serenely confident in his underplaying Robert Downey Jr. returns as industrialist Tony Stark whose ""Iron Man 2"" colleague Black Widow played by Scarlett Johansson joins the fight against Loki (slithering Tom Hiddleston back from ""Thor""). Thor himself played by Chris Hemsworth comes round once again with his boomerang hammer. Chris Evans aka Captain America re-enters the ring a symbol of retro-nostalgia and stalwart God-fearing patriotic values. Samuel L. Jackson who has dipping in and out of these movies since the first ""Iron Man"" four years ago finally gets some serious screen time as does more surprisingly Clark Greggs Agent Coulson. I like Gregg; with all these outre costume-party characters swanning around and cleaning clocks its nice to have a Cheshire cat of a character man get his due. And in this corner the new guys. Chiefly theres Mark Ruffalo as Dr. Bruce Banner better known as the Hulk. Previously the Hulk has been played by Lou Ferrigno on TV and in feature films Eric Bana and Edward Norton. As with Downey Ruffalo doesnt have to do much to hold the screen; unlike Downey Ruffalo finds ways to do so without resorting to an artful but narrow range of throwaway sarcasm. Jeremy Renners Hawkeye deadly with the straight-to-the-eye arrows cements 2012 as The Year of the Bow arriving to the Marvel movies as he has so soon after""The Hunger Games.""""The Avengers"" is essentially an extended action sequence interrupted by an extended soul-search in the middle. On board their invisible flying aircraft carrier known as the Helicarrier our heroes the agents of the covert S.H.I.E.L.D. peacekeeping club  keep breaking down into rivaling subgroups at the wily behest of Loki whos like the most evil gym coach ever. Whedons narrative task with ""The Avengers""? Finding the best most propulsive ways to pit Thor against Loki; the Hulk (wittily delayed in terms of the characters Big Entrances) against Black Widow; Black Widow against the evil version of Hawkeye; and so forth.The ""Transformers 3""scale of the urban carnage in the final hour of ""The Avengers"" is a long way from the relative size and contrasting comic tone of the first ""Iron Man"" one of my two faves (the other being ""Captain America"") in this corner of the comic-book movie universe. When ""Iron Man"" clicked with audiences four summers ago the reasons were both clear and refreshing Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow who returns here had unusually potent comic chemistry and although director Jon Favreau (one of the producers on ""The Avengers"") wasnt a genius at staging action he knew how to establish a tone and stick to it. So does Whedon though I surely do wish someone other than Alan Silvestri had composed the music; this stuff is so generic the movie would actually be better off with no music and someone in voiceover merely saying ""And here well have some stirring triumphal nonsense like the stuff you heard three scenes ago."" Little matter at least to the box office. Whedons both a wiseacre -- Stark at one point refers to Thor as ""Point Break"" referencing his Patrick Swayze surfer locks -- and a sincere devotee of Marvels durable malleable ensemble of lugs and indestructibles introduced as a group in 1963. The ending which wont come as a surprise sets us up for a sequel. Just as Stark and Loki represent two preening egomaniacal sides of the same coin ""The Avengers"" is both a culminator and a set-up for more more more. mjphillipstribune.com The Avengers -- 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout and a mild drug reference)Running time 223Opens midnight Thursday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies The Avengers (movie) Music Industry Music Robert Downey Jr. Chicago Tribune Columnists Black Widow The Avengers Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising73deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0501-avengers-20120502,0,2194875.column",200,marvel'stheavengers24,marvel'stheavengers,chicagotribune
"Avengers The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; avengers-the ) Avengers The (United States 2012) May 02 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Avengers kicks ass. Its a loud brash spectacle that blows up as many things as a Transformers outing but without the same grinding sense of soulless robotic monotony. For years Marvel has been building to this movie painstakingly introducing many of The Avengers key players in what has amounted to five prequels Iron Man Iron Man 2 The Incredible Hulk Thor and Captain America. If some of those chapters seemed a little thin when viewed as stand-alones The Avengers has redeemed their existence. This movie has the potential to revitalize the superhero movie genre... or kill it. The Avengers has raised the bar to a level where the more ""traditional"" approach of having a single superhero tangle with a supervillain or two may no longer be enough. Once characters like Iron Man The Hulk Thor Captain America Black Widow and Hawkeye have become involved in an epic story of this sort how can they go back to being regular superheroes? When something has been dialed up to an ""11"" isnt there an inherent letdown to turning it back to a ""7""? I doubt theres a comic book fan alive who wont be walking on Cloud Nine when exiting a theater playing The Avengers. In Joss Whedon the producers found the perfect director a man who knows the material and his audience in equal measure. For Avengers fans this is a home run. For the ""average"" movie-goer who may not know the difference between the superhero group and the spy ring featuring Patrick McNee and Diana Rigg this is at worst a triple. Finding faults is a little like picking nits although they are there. The first hour can at times seem sluggish as theres a fair amount of setup and exposition that needs to be endured. And there are times during the final battle when the special effects take over and things edge toward Bays fetishistic fascination with hardware over everything else. Yet those are isolated moments in a jaw-droppingly intense 50-minute battle royale (with cheese). Every hero gets his/her time to shine although some shine more brightly than others. The threat that brings six superheroes together is posed by Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the adopted brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who has broken into SHIELD headquarters brainwashed Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Professor Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and stolen the Tesseract an uber-powerful glowing blue cube. Director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to stop the Norse diety but fails. Under threat of a planetary catastrophe Fury recruits Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans) and sends Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to bring in Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo). Thor makes his appearance when he learns that his brother is up to no good. After a major battle Loki is captured but he appears perfectly content to be held in close confinement on SHIELDs hovercraft. Hes biding his time while his underlings work to open a wormhole that will allow an alien race to attack Earth. Poor Manhattan is to be Ground Zero for this interplanetary apocalypse. The core appeal of The Avengers has been (and always will be) the gathering of heroes. The comic book was initially created in the early 60s as Marvels answer to DCs Justice League (which banded together Superman Batman Flash Wonder Woman and others). The movie fulfills fans wet dreams of having a handful of major Marvel superheroes come together in one forum. Whedon provides one of the time-honored occurrences of ""crossover"" comic books before the heroes band together to take on the bad guys they fight each other. So we have Iron Man going at it against Thor with a little Captain America thrown in for good measure. Hulk and Thor have smackdown. And so forth. Until Nick Fury gives a little pep talk egos trump heroism. One of the most interesting themes of The Avengers relates to how individuals comfortable with being the biggest and baddest kids on the block learn to work with others with similar capabilities. Its like when a high school valedictorian finds himself in a class full of valedictorians at Harvard. Ultimately The Avengers is all about action. The main storyline is pretty basic. The most impressive thing Whedon does with the screenplay is to provide all the characters sufficient screen time and keep the movie from becoming a runaway special effects extravaganza. The explosive high octane finale - a massive battle that runs for more than 45 minutes and in which half of New York is leveled - works so much better than anything in Transformers because we care about the heroes and because attention is paid to the little details. While Iron Man and Hulk are up in the sky smashing big ugly flying monsters Captain America is saving people trapped on a bus. Whedon avoids getting too serious although he avoids full-on campiness. Admittedly the end of the Earth is grim stuff but in keeping with the comic book tone of the movie theres plenty of humor including at least a couple of laugh-out-loud moments (one with a literal ""punch line""). The filmmakers ensure were laughing with them to avoid the unenviable possibility of laughing at them. This is after all pretty silly stuff when you get down to it; Whedons approach is perfect for the material. One senses the only prequel director who might have been able to pull this off as well is Jon Favreau who is on board as an executive producer. Most of the ""original"" actors signed on to recreate their characters. The most valuable of these is Robert Downey Jr. who has the most screen time of all The Avengers. Its not quite Iron Man 3 but there are times when its close. No one is likely to argue with this decision. Downey is terrific whether hes sharing a quiet moment with Gwyneth Paltrow or trading barbs with one of the other actors. Scarlett Johansson reprises her secondary role from Iron Man 2. Chris Hemsworth Tim Hiddleston and Stellan Skarsgard are back from Thor (without Natalie Portman although her characters absence is explained). Chris Evans reprises the title role from Captain America. And Samuel L. Jackson finally gets a chance to appear in more than a random scene or two; hes The Avengers glue. Newcomers include Mark Ruffalo taking over for Edward Norton (who in turn replaced Eric Bana) as The Hulk (Lou Ferrigno provides the UnJolly Green Giants voice) and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye (although he had a cameo in Thor). Its no secret that The Avengers was converted from 2-D to 3-D in postproduction (although some reports indicate that Whedon composed shots with an awareness that the movies primary platform would be 3-D). That in and of itself argues that 2-D is a perfectly valid way to see this movie. However this may be one of those occasions when its worth paying the surcharge especially if theres an IMAX option available. The Avengers boasts what is easily the best post-production conversion to-date. Its not Avatar immersive but it is close. Problems are few and far between. I failed to notice any motion blur the brightness levels were okay and I didnt suffer from eye fatigue (even though the movie clocks in at nearly 2 1/2 hours). The Avengers is more about pop and sizzle than substance and the 3-D delivers. Put this in the admittedly small club of titles for which putting on the glasses is not an unwarranted burden. For those who like Easter Eggs there are a couple of reasons to stay through the end credits. One-third of the way through theres a short scene with a surprise that will delight comic book fans and mean absolutely nothing to those not steeped in Avengers lore. Then after all the credits have rolled theres an amusing moment that adds nothing to the story but is likely to provoke a smile and a chuckle. For those who feel like leaving the moment the movie proper is finished nothing critical will be missed. By swinging for the fences The Avengers opens the 2012 summer movie season with an explosive bang that will reverberate through the superhero genre for years. Some superhero movies like Christopher Nolans Batman outings play on a different field and wont be impacted. But many comic book translations will find themselves chasing The Avengers and more than a few will be found wanting. This is a game changer. By giving audiences everything they could possibly want and more Whedon has ushered in a new era of bigger louder and more spectacular. Future entries into this genre will either have to rise to the challenge or disappoint. The Avengers will likely not be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar but it mayl be one of the most important movies to arrive in theaters during 2012.

(Marvel / Paramount Pictures) Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man in Marvels The Avengers.(Marvel / Paramount Pictures) movie review The Avengers is both a marvel and not Add to ... Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday May 02 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Nixon and Brezhnev Kobe and LeBron the Three Tenors - all-star summits almost invariably promise more than they deliver and much as my inner 12-year-old might beg to differ The Avengers is no exception. Pulled off their separate franchises in the Marvel League the big guns - Iron Man Thor Captain America The Hulk - are now brought together to suit up for the same squad. There while dealing with the trifling matter of saving the wide world from imminent destruction - a slam dunk for any one of them - our superheroes and their superegos gather like kindergarteners in a sandbox to face an infinitely more daunting challenge Can the boys being boys learn to work and play well with each other? Oh the suspense mounts. Robert Downey Jr. right and Robert De Niro attend the screening of Marvel Studios ""The Avengers"" on closing night of the Tribeca Film Festival Saturday April 28 2012 in New York. Dave Allocca / AP Movies Video The Avengers take Tribeca Cast member Scarlett Johansson poses at the world premiere of the film ""Marvels The Avengers"" in Hollywood California April 11 2012. Danny Moloshok/Reuters video Video The Avengers cast take over red carpet Actress Scarlett Johansson poses by her star after it was unveiled on the Walk of Fame in Hollywood California May 2 2012. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters video Video Scarlett Johansson gets Hollywood star Of course so does the budget and like every self-respecting blockbuster this model comes with the expected 3-D bells and CGI whistles - all the costly stuff that is guaranteed to put the lavish into the spectacle even as it seems inexorably to drain the sense from the plot and the interest from the characters. Expected too is the result a kind of sterile opulence or if you prefer a magnificent emptiness. Like many before him director Joss Whedon has mastered the twin arts of raising and razing - building palaces of visual wonders where massive spacecraft hover and gods thunder and mortals fly then subjecting these same wonders to prolonged bouts of destruction and mayhem. The eyes are often delighted the senses are consistently engaged/assaulted and the funny bone is occasionally tickled but obviously our emotions emerge wholly unscathed. To watch another comic book transformed into another blockbuster is to ""marvel"" at much and to feel nothing - thats a safer bet than the converse perhaps which may explain the genres popularity. But enough of the outer crank and back to my inner kid who as the cinematic panels flipped through the standard allotment of action + banter + more action + more banter did manage to summon some feelings although they were decidedly mixed. He delighted again in Robert Downey Jr.s witty insistence on recharacterizing his guy as Irony Man (an insistence that obviously plays better outside than inside that metallic suit). He thoroughly enjoyed the new casting of Mark Ruffalo in the divided role of Bruce Banner thinking him vastly superior to his predecessors at conveying the sheer torment of trying to keep a lid on ones interior Hulk. And he liked the early bickering and battering among the convened stars especially the way Irony Man kept sticking it to that earnest relic Captain America. On the inner kids other hand he was disappointed once more in Thors famous hammer which still looks less like a weapon befitting a deity than like something readily available to any schnook in Aisle 4 at Rona. As for the lesser luminaries recruited to round out the all-star team he had high hopes for Black Widow. But his youthful hormones poised to rage at the mere sight of Scarlett Johansson in martial arts gear remained disappointingly unstirred. In the token sexy female department Scarlett was a pale pink at best. He might have felt similarly about Gwyneth Paltrow but blinked and missed her fleeting cameo. The very bad Loki performed by the very British Tom Hiddleston did not disappoint him although he did find it a tad unfair to have all those superheroes ganging up on one lone villain even if that villain could summon an entire alien air force to descend through a portal in the heavens and subject New York to an interminable blitzing by alien air force thingies. Happily my inner kid unlike my outer crank is sophisticated enough to appreciate that a movie climax should be insufferably loud and interminably long - thats how we know its a blockbuster. Thats not to say my two selves werent ever in agreement. On the matter of Samuel L. Jackson a.k.a. Nick Fury we shared this strong opinion No one not man or god could sport a leather eye patch with more panache. Alas we parted ways again over the Avengers inevitable last words ""Theyll come back."" One of us thrilled to the promise the other bristled at the threat yet the winner of that little contretemps is hardly in doubt At the movies and beyond in this or any summer better a kid than a crank.

Joss Whedons overcrowded ""Avengers"" shows just how thoroughly played-out the genre has become Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Joss Whedon Movies The Avengers Entertainment News Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in ""The Avengers"" If youre new around here this is how the script goes I damn ""The Avengers"" with faint praise observing that the (supposed) culmination of the long laborious Marvel Comics movie franchise is a competent but pointless popcorn entertainment thats being wildly overpraised simply for existing without being incoherent and terrible. Some readers sniff from behind their digital copies of the Atlantic Why did you even bother? Others lament that once again a non-fan of comic-book movies was sent to review something whose true significance as with a sacred scroll written in Tocharian B is yielded only to a coterie of gnostics and believers. (An enormous coterie in this case.) Someone will invoke the ghost of Pauline Kael to instruct us that movies are meant to entertain and someone else will suggest that the editors send me back to covering films about lesbian sheepherders made in Azerbaijan.Well there just isnt enough output from Azeri lesbian cinema to keep me busy so here we all are again. Cutting to the chase ""The Avengers"" does what it needs to do absolutely. In my conversation with writer and director Joss Whedon a couple of weeks ago he promised Marvel fans that this movie would ""deliver unto them"" and that it does with two and a half hours of increasingly frenetic action and a swarm of characters who crack wise in Whedon fashion but feel strongly connected to the mish-mash Marvel mythology. If youre not much of a Marvel Comics person but just want to get an early start on your mindless summer moviegoing well I guess this picture is no stupider than anything else. (As you can see I possess a certain knack for writing irresistible blurb copy.)If you belong to the significant quadrant of the population that feels a powerful tidal impulse to belong to this pop-culture moment and hence yearn to believe that ""The Avengers"" is terrific explosive awesome fun (or other language of your choosing) please dont let me harsh your vibe. I mean that seriously; what kind of person would I be if I begrudged others a good time at the movies? But its my job -- and I guess my inclination -- to stand outside those tidal currents and view these big spectacles dispassionately as far as I can. What I see in ""The Avengers"" unfortunately is a diminished film despite its huge scale and kind of a bore. Its a diminishment of Whedons talents as he squeezes himself into an ill-fitting narrative straitjacket and its a diminished form that has become formula that depends entirely on minor technical innovations and leaves virtually no room for drama or tragedy or anything else that might make the story actually interesting. To praise the movie lavishly as so many people have done and will continue to do basically requires making endless allowances. Its really good (for being a comic-book movie). Its really good (for being almost exactly like dozens of other things). Its really good (for being utterly inconsequential).I saw ""The Avengers"" less than a week ago and already much of its a blur; if it werent so easy to find plot synopses widely available Id probably forget key details. In another month all that will stick with me is a few striking scenes and images Tom Hiddleston as the sneering Norse god Loki compelling a crowd of Stuttgart civilians to kneel before him until one older man no doubt remembering the last time the Germans did that rises to confront him. Or Robert Downey Jr. as playboy zillionaire Tony Stark cum Iron Man delivering oh-snap comebacks one after another to Chris Evans ultra-square Captain America. (Have Downey and John Malkovich ever been in a movie together doing their dueling ""Im so gay but Im actually straight"" routines? I think not.) Or Scarlett Johansson in a catsuit as superspy Natasha Romanoff cocking her head just so as if to acknowledge that shes the idealized fetish object of the 11-year-old boy within every so-called adult male.Is there any point in discussing the plot of ""The Avengers"" anyway? If youve read this far the odds are strong that you either A) already know the whole story B) dont want me to issue clueless spoilers or C) simply dont care. For those who may choose ""none of the above"" I can explain that one-eyed super-secret government honcho Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) has to reassemble the superhero team known as the Avengers after Loki -- last seen in Kenneth Branaghs ""Thor"" getting evicted from Asgard home of the Norse gods -- comes to Earth in search of a mystical energy source called the Tesseract with a force of insect-like space aliens following him. So Iron Man Captain America Natasha Thor the Thunder God (Chris Hemsworth) and Dr. Bruce Banner aka the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo in a nicely understated embittered performance) all gather on a flying aircraft-carrier/command-center thingy along with the imprisoned Loki who plans to sow discord and dissension before his super-disappointing aliens -- rejected by Michael Bay for insufficient gnarlitude I think -- show up to wreck the place. You Might Also Like Got all that? You dont believe me. Theres also quite a bit of eye candy in ""The Avengers"" not all of it Johansson-related and a few glimmers of genuine narrative weight as in that moment with Loki and the Germans. But in trying to cram in enough plot and back story and increasingly incoherent action sequences for at least three summer movies Whedon never finds a confident or relaxed narrative pace and the results are exhausting a picture that pushes three hours and feels like five. Obviously Whedon is one of the most experienced storytellers of our time and I have to assume this is a deliberate attempt to satisfy the core young-dude demographic with an experience that will be physically draining like an extended amusement-park ride. I felt tired at the end of ""Avengers"" for sure but even more bored and irritated probably because the pretense of mythic grandeur cant stand up to the fundamental teenage-boy men-in-tights silliness of the whole enterprise.I know I know. Im profaning sacred ground here. Once upon a time and a very long time ago it was the teenage boys (and occasional girls) who grew into adults and kept on reading superhero comics were viewed as oddballs or outcasts. When Hollywood began to rediscover the pioneering DC and Marvel superheroes of the 20th century it was refreshing and delightful at first and for a while the Christopher Reeve Superman movies Tim Burtons ""Batman"" Sam Raimis Spider-Man trilogy the X-Men series. All were lots of fun all descended into fatal decadence -- as exemplified by Joel Schumachers ""Batman amp; Robin"" quite possibly the worst film ever made in any language or tradition -- all have since been zombified and ripped from the grave for another go-round with emphatically mixed results. Theres nothing new about any of that arguably. One of the defining characteristics of Batman and Superman and all their kind is their malleability their immortality their apparently endless recyclability.But for the love of Christ at what point is the triumph of comic-book culture sufficient? Those one-time comic-book pariahs are now the dominant force in pop-culture entertainment and their works are deemed to be not just big but also relevant and important much the way that Cecil B. DeMilles crap-history spectacles were in another day. This latest series of Marvel adaptations mounted on a scale that would make Richard Wagner blush has attained baroque heights of meaninglessness that make the James Bond movies seem like Strindberg by comparison. I would agree by the way that Stan Lee and his many acolytes and followers have created a kind of modern syncretic mythology and that over the long long haul both the Marvel and DC universes have incorporated some narrative complexity and some sense of mortality. Thats not possible in two or three hours of mass-market entertainment so we get these movies with zero dramatic arc where the protagonists fates are never in doubt and the central issues are all technical Iron Mans ass-kicking fight scene with Thor; soulful Bruce Banners transformation into The Hulk; the precise nature of the alien-invasion force; Scarlett Johansson hubba-hubba catsuit. Theres no point getting exercised about public taste Millions of people out there are eager for the visceral vacation from everyday life that ""The Avengers"" will provide and given the difficult task of packing all these superheroes into one story Whedon succeeds pretty well. (Id rank ""Avengers"" above ""Iron Man 2 but below the first ""Iron Man"" roughly on the same level as ""Thor."") My problem is less with the movie or its audience or Joss Whedon -- although I honestly dont think being an A-list Hollywood director serves his talents appropriately -- than with the penumbra of bratty entitled coolness that surrounds the whole project. Its a neat little postmodern trick actually to simultaneously position this movie as the most central pop-culture event of 2012 and insist on some kind of edgy outsider status that renders any and all detractors as pipe-smoking William F. Buckley squares defending a nonexistent Establishment.Right up to the end of ""The Avengers"" I carried with me the faint hope that this really would mark the conclusion of this particular epoch-spanning series of hyperinflated comic-book spectacles. For good or ill it is not to be As Marvel fans surely know already the usual ""stinger"" follows the closing credits revealing that behind Loki and the insectoid aliens lurks ... well somebody or something who will propel us into ""Thor 2 or ""Iron Man 3 or whatever else is coming. This mimics the way comic books have long worked of course and theres something wistful about it As the transitory ersatz awesomeness of this particular spectacle fades away like the cinematic equivalent of SweeTarts on the tongue true Platonic awesomeness is waiting out there somewhere in the next chapter.

In humanspeak that means youve got a bunch of superheroes in a single movie. (Why not call it what it really is--the economy value pack?) The Avengers has burned like the sweatiest geeks fantasy for years now. If you have to ask why it was so crucially important to get all of this spandex on camera at the same time you probably dont belong here and should immediately find a safe location in a bunker somewhere. Clearly you havent been waiting breathlessly through the credits of Iron Man or Thor desperate for a glimpse of an eye-patched Samuel L. Jackson the almost-mystical Nick Fury and his team to come. Honestly I havent been one of the anticipators either. Still a certain cape-wearing savior--director Joss Whedon--should be thanked for making a summer tentpole that remembers to be fun flip and broadly entertaining. Whedon the pop savant responsible for TVs Buffy the Vampire Slayer straddles the line between sarcastic gab and pulp solemnity like Eli Manning on a fourth-down go-it-alone jag. Entrusted with his most expensive project to date hes made irreverent room for jokes about collectible playing cards flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz the embarrassing behavior of Asgardian siblings and belated requests for stiff drinks blissfully ignorant that millions of why-so-serious fans are depending on him. Its a ballsy move you cant help but love. Did Hollywood have to spend several fortunes ""reintroducing"" these characters in recent films of varying quality? Not really. Robert Downey Jr. plays millionaire tech-jerk Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man a man who likes to wear iron. Theres golden-locked Thor (Chris Hemsworth enjoyably pompous) and a defrozen Captain America (Chris Evans milking the squareness) neither of whom required feature-length preambles. Its telling that the Avenger who steals this movie is one we havent met yet Mark Ruffalos brainy Bruce Banner a radiation scientist with rage issues that turn him into the ""other guy."" They assemble along with Scarlett Johansson as Distracting Catsuit (I might be getting some of the names wrong) and That Badass from The Hurt Locker (Jeremy Renner as the vestigial Hawkeye) to do battle with British-Accented Villain Whos Remarkably Close in Temperament to General Zod. This last role Loki played by the normally subtle Tom Hiddleston asks the actor to scowl and frequently demand kneeling before him--whats with the constant need for supplication? You wish the guy had darker ambitions than being a yoga instructor. With the stage set and one of those glowing power cubes--the kind that are always so prevalent in sci-fi films--absconded with The Avengers eases for a pleasurable while into the type of movie it really wants to be a cutup comedy. Bickering is a part of membership apparently and like J.J. Abramss fleet-tongued reboot of Star Trek theres a thrill in seeing two-dimensional cartoons take on an additional layer of mouthy self-awareness. (If the script lacks for lustiness as Bryan Singers X-Men had in spades it wins on dialogue.) The action scenes--blissfully easy to follow--are where Whedon makes the giant leap into the big leagues. A naval battleship takes to the air on massive propellers (a beautiful sequence of pure wonderment) only to get firebombed by Lokis infiltrators. Later Manhattan fares awfully as downtown suffers the rage of floating metal serpents sort of like Chinese dragons but less happy. It could be contended that The Avengers is subtly bookending itself with the two most traumatic attacks in American history and countering them with the fictional response we secretly yearned for. (Maybe the films title is apt.) If thats the case then these displays of superheroic teamwork are as valid an expression of wish-fulfillment as the movies have offered in a while. ""People just might need a little...old-fashioned"" a nostalgic voice says--a moment of sentiment in a blockbuster beating with a proud undefeated heart. Yes Hulk will smash but hell also feel. Dont struggle if you do too.

The cube starts spewing gamma radiation heralding the arrival of Loki (Tom Hiddleston)--brother of demigod Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and villain of 2011s Thor--who puts a spell on scientist Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard) and SHIELD agent Barton (Jeremy Renner) so that theyll do his bidding. The trio escapes with the Tesseract in hand with eye-patched agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) unable to stop them.With the help of ass-kicking all-purpose Girl Friday Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) Fury gathers a motley crew to help wrangle the Tesseract back. Theres Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) pulled away from Stark Tower the gaudy monument to himself he has built to showcase a pioneering sustainable-energy source. Gamma-radiation expert Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is found in Southeast Asia where he tends to the local sick and maintains an equilibrium that has prevented ""the other guy""--the Hulk--from showing up for a year. Captain A. frozen in a block of ice for 70 years and thawed in the present day at the end of his movie serves as the surrogate for the segment of the audience walking in cold and desperately needing to be debriefed on all of the above. Thor initially unlocatable even by SHIELDs all-seeing surveillance shows up looking for his brother.""These people may be isolated unbalanced even"" concedes Fury. Theyre also largely up their own asses each of them lone warriors wary of giving up control. Once theyre assembled at Furys invisible-to-outsiders secret headquarters Whedon uses the calm in between Loki-initiated storms to demonstrate ad nauseam that the Avengers just cant get along. As daring as it might seem for the biggest superhero movie ever to turn the action knob way down for an hour so that its actors can do some acting the actual material theyre given is as programmatic as a bad culture-clash rom-com transparently meant to tear our heroes apart just so they can come back together. One scene in which Thor Iron Man and Cap each whip out their superpowers to show the others whose is biggest amounts to a CGI-enabled round of roshambo.Writer/director Whedon first showed his incredible talent for long-form storytelling in TVs Buffy the Vampire Slayer infusing the fantastic with slowly built genuinely relatable emotion. On The Avengers comparatively minute canvas of two and a half hours Whedon effectively creates a sketch of a working universe and tells us that his characters are emotionally damaged but doesnt explore that damage in any substantive way. The most Whedon-esque parts of the script are the flippant wisecracks--self-satisfied self-deprecating or somehow both--that the fucked-up superheroes toss off as knee-jerk self-defense in life-or-death situations. What worked as the cool diffusion of stakes in Buffy here underlines the lack of suspense to the mission We never get the sense that any of the heroes might not survive to snark again.Maybe its the shock of the new but the most exciting actor here is Ruffalo the third star cast as Banner/the Hulk in 10 years after Eric Bana and Edward Norton proved unprofitable. Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who in contrast to the preening hunks on the team knows better than to draw attention to himself. As a fellow top brainiac with dangerously repressed issues Banner brings out a measure of complexity in Tony Stark that a tired-looking Downey--who was revelatory in the first Iron Man as someone forced to become part machine in order to realize his full human potential--can no longer muster on his own.The four main male Avengers at least combine to form a varied gallery of masculine neurosis. The women fare less well with Gwyneth Paltrows Pepper Potts who was briefly promoted to CEO of Stark Industries in Iron Man 2 given just one dialogue scene Barefoot in cutoff shorts she whispers implied sexual promises to Tony and then books it so he can get some work done. Johansson reprising her role from Iron Man 2 is the only actress given any sort of inner life to work with. The Avengers hints that this former Russian spy with ""a very specific skill set"" has a complicated backstory--sordid and shameful perhaps but also rife with transformative drama suggesting an arc thats much more interesting than anything the characters travel here.The final act of The Avengers consists of an insanely complex action set piece containing some truly cool visual shit not least the alien army summoned by Loki which arrives in some kind of undulating indestructible prehistoric flying fish. But really who cares about another battle? We know how this is going to end. The long technically bravura sequence is given dramatic tension only by occasional scraps of dialogue such as a two-line exchange between Natasha and Barton over a job they worked in Budapest alluding to the mysterious lives theyd all been leading before this movie. Then a few minutes later Iron Man breaks a moment of tension with a homophobic wisecrack. Every time the movie hints at something rich and evocative Whedon undercuts it with a punchline--his instincts as a big-picture storyteller crippled by his short-term need to please the crowd.

In one of the many rousingly intense confrontations that make up Joss Whedons heavy-duty Marvel action psychodrama The Avengers the hammer (literally) meets the shield and -- clang -- the shield wins. At least Thor can console himself that hes stronger than the other guy whos busting his chops Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). When it comes to putdowns however even Iron Mans snarkmeister alter ego Tony Stark has Thor beat. He refers to the billowy Viking megahulk as ""Point Break"" and ""Shakespeare in the Park."" The best thing about The Avengers a multi-tentpole blockbuster that gathers half a dozen Marvel superheroes and unfurls them on a baddie from another planet is that it also unleashes them on each other. Simply put These freaks of goodness may be a team but they dont like one another very much. The six have been assembled by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) director of the peacekeeping alliance S.H.I.E.L.D. to defeat Loki (Tom Hiddleston) Thors megalomaniac adoptive brother who arrives through a wormhole and steals the Tesseract -- a cosmic cube that throws off ice-blue electromagnetic vapors like the best special effect of 1986. Loki with stringy long hair black eyeballs and a ghostly pallor (he looks like Marilyn Manson playing Richard III) plans to destroy the world through ultimate war. Earths defenders are Captain America Thor Iron Man the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) the ninja twirler Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson with not enough to do) and the crossbow ace Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner saturnine cool). They catch Loki and lock him up in a barely penetrable glass booth and the film then basically counts down to the alien attack that Loki calls forth. The first half hour is murk with too much gobbledygook on the Tesseract (a talisman that could save our environment and yada yada). But once our heroes cram into a flying command station its Five Angry Supermen (and one superwoman). This isnt a case of more being less. The four whove already fronted their own Marvel films look all the sharper as supporting studs jockeying for primacy. The magnetically stolid Captain America emerges as the team leader Iron Man is the nattering narcissist who could hardly give a damn and Thor is the alien outsider whos more intent on saving his planet than on rescuing Earth. As for the Hulk the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that hes at war every moment with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem Hes a lot more fun in small doses.) The second smartest thing they did was to allow Tom Hiddleston to let it rip as Loki. Hes close to a generic villain but Hiddleston invests his ravings and evil smile with a sleek mystery and power that suggests he may be an actor of the stature of Gary Oldman. In terms of storytelling The Avengers is for the most part a highly functional banged-together vehicle that runs on synthetic franchise fuel. Yet the grand finale of CGI action set in the streets of New York is -- in every sense -- smashing. True it wouldnt be out of place in a Michael Bay movie but no Transformer was ever as transfixing as this leaping flying pummeling superteam. It makes you eager to see what theyll do next now that theyve defeated a threat even bigger than their egos.

Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Four superheroes band together to save Earth from an alien army. BOTTOM LINE Snappy humor and all-in performances make this a guaranteed crowd-pleaser even for non-comics fans. CAST Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Chris Hemsworth Mark Ruffalo LENGTH 223 A Norse god a World War II veteran a modern defense contractor and the green-skinned star of a 1970s television series -- thats a lot of superheroes to pack into one movie. More important thats a lot of fanboys to please. Luckily writer-director Joss Whedon is one -- a fanboy that is though he also does a superheroic job of compressing several summer blockbusters into ""Marvels The Avengers"" a splashy flashy pass-the-popcorn extravaganza. This is a movie that knows and deeply loves its audience but its funny smart and good-natured enough to please the rest of us too. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? With its classically hokey plot involving an alien army and a power cube called the Tesseract (Zak Penn of Syfys ""Alphas"" co-wrote) ""The Avengers"" isnt trying to break new ground. The payoff is watching four appealing actors don their costumes and have fun with each other and Whedon gives you nearly 2 1/2 hours worth. Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man rules the roost with his one-liners; Chris Evans shines as his polar opposite the earnest Captain America; Chris Hemsworth as Thor roars his Beowulfian lines with good humor; and Mark Ruffalo makes a nerve-racking Bruce Banner though his crude Claymation transformation into the Hulk is a disappointment compared to the films other kabillion-dollar effects. Scarlett Johanssons slippery Black Widow is a more engaging newcomer than Jeremy Renners humorless Hawkeye while Samuel L. Jackson and Clark Gregg return in dependably fine form as team leader Nick Fury and his lovable mascot Phil Coulson. The secret scene-stealer though is Tom Hiddleston as the power-mad Loki deftly switching between Shakespearean intensity and the flippant pop humor that gives ""The Avengers"" the light sparkle of an ensemble comedy. That easy breezy attitude and Whedons snappy direction (which livens up overly familiar sequences like the Manhattan-wrecking finale) are what make ""The Avengers"" such a crowd-pleaser. A hermetically sealed comics collection might be helpful but not required. VideoTrailer Marvels The Avengers PLOT Four superheroes band together to save Earth from an alien army.

Writer-director Joss Whedon pulls off both in ""The Avengers"" an exhilarating ode to what mainstream comics do best. In my childhood (and admittedly parts of my adulthood) I read the ""Avengers"" comics because they were equally concerned with character interactions and the old biff-bam-pow. On one page our heroes would be sitting around a meeting table needling each other about their differing methodologies and on the next they would assemble to beat back some threat from dastardly aliens. Also read The Avengers Smashes Box-Office Records with 178M Overseas Thats the balance that Whedon has so brilliantly accomplished here telling a story in which who these heroes are and how they deal with each other remains at the forefront even when Manhattan is under assault from an interplanetary Big Bad. He gets the vibe and the delights of Marvel comic books in the same way that Spielberg and Lucas intuitively understood the appeal of serials in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" You dont have to be a comics fan to have a great time (although it sure couldnt hurt) but you may need a reminder of everything thats gone down in the previous Marvel movies. Remember that powerful tesseract (Marvel readers know it as the Cosmic Cube) that played such a big part in ""Captain America The First Avenger""? Now it resides in a SHIELD laboratory where astrophysicist Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard reprising his role from ""Thor"") is trying to unlock its secrets under the watchful eye of the arrow-wielding Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) also known as Hawkeye. During a site visit from SHIELD chief Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) Asgardian trickster Loki (Tom Hiddleston) shows up to steal the tesseract enslaving Selvig and Barton in the process. After the entire installation sinks into the earth (a moment reminiscent of the finale of Whedons ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV series) Fury assembles the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson last seen kicking ass in black leather in ""Iron Man 2"") Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) -- whos constantly worried that the Hulk (whom he refers to as ""the other guy"") will manifest Captain America (Chris Evans) and Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.). Its an unwritten rule in the comics that heroes have to fight each other usually over some misunderstanding when they first meet so when Thor (Chris Hemsworth) returns to Earth to stop Loki he and Iron Man get into an impressive brawl. (The thunder god will later mix it up with Hulk in a more equitable match.) Despite their distrust of each other and of the secrets that SHIELD is keeping from them this group must somehow form a family and these heroes are eventually compelled to join forces to stop Loki from using the tesseract as a portal for some very nasty would-be alien conquerors. ""The Avengers"" doesnt immediately inspire confidence -- the editing of the opening raids eventual chase and shoot-out feels choppy and confusing and the alien with whom Loki argues early in the film looks straight out of a low-budget kiddy show. But Whedon knows how to write an ensemble (just look at ""Buffy"" and ""Firefly"") and when these larger-than-life characters start bouncing off one another the witty repartee flies fast and furious even in the midst of battle. Whedon gets the big stuff right too from the conversion of an aircraft carrier to the enormous SHIELD flying fortress to the final battle which originally feels like its just going to be a coherent Michael Bay moment but winds up delivering the adrenaline while also driving the story and the characters. And while I wasnt crazy about the solo movies featuring the Hulk Captain America or Thor all three characters felt revitalized in this group context. In many ways ""The Avengers"" feels like the truest adaptation of the original comics to the motion picture screen. It doesnt mythologize or minimize or condescend or get lost in fanboy minutiae. Instead it plays up the clash of personalities -- and the simple act of acknowledging that superheroes can actually have personalities may be its boldest move -- while never skimping on the popcorn thrills. It gives superhero movies and even summer movies in general a good name. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

"Is Avengers the holy grail of superhero movies? |       NJ.com comments Is Avengers the holy grail of superhero movies? Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 01 2012 at 700 AM updated May 30 2012 at 1050 AM View/Post Comments Zade RosenthalThor (Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (Chris Evans) in ""The Avengers."" They are called the Avengers an all-star group of crusading superheroes spies and assassins including Thor Iron Man the Hulk Captain America Black Widow and Hawkeye. That much we know. Still the question remains Who exactly are they avenging? The answer turns out to be easy Comic book fans everywhere. Every fan whos ever walked out of a superhero film saying ""You know the effects dont have to look bad ..."" Whos grumbled at corny dialogue or cavalier rewrites. Whos protested ""You know these things can be serious fun."" Because thats what ""The Avengers"" is -- and thats who theyve come to stick up for. No the movie isnt as seriously dark and stylish as Christopher Nolans Gotham City films -- thats a different place a different universe. But it is true to Marvel. And after years of buildup its a reward to patient audiences whove been waiting for this team-up for years. For the non-initiated -- and certainly some interest has flagged among the general populace -- it does help to have seen the past few films in the Marvel series. One sort-of hero here the agent Black Widow comes from ""Iron Man 2""; her equally morally ambiguous buddy Hawkeye was introduced in ""Thor"" as was this films chief villain Loki. And the big whatsis theyre all after -- a powerful energy source that can open the gateway to another world -- was part of the plot of ""Captain America."" Got it? Good. Now youre up to speed for a movie which like any classic caper first introduces us to our heroes then brings them together as a team (with plenty of flare-ups along the way) and finally unleashes them on the common (but frankly not-so-common) enemy. Director and co-writer Joss Whedon is an old genre hand as is Zak Penn who collaborated on the script with him; clearly they get this material. And even better while they understand the conflict in these characters they also get the humor in them and -- knowing theres not enough time to dwell on each characters flaws -- go for a lighter touch. Zade RosenthalJeremy Renner as Hawkeye and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. Smartly they divvy the jokes up too the way the Marx Brothers did. Not that this is ""A Night at the Apocalypse"" but each character has his own approach and his own source and style of humor. So Robert Downey Jr. gets the snobbish witticisms; Mark Ruffalos Hulk (or at least his CGI self) gets the physical gags. Chris Evans Captain America is all straight-arrow naivete; Chris Hemsworths Thor a classic fish out of water. Add the real-life sex appeal of Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner as Black Widow and Hawkeye and Samuel L. Jackson doing full-on Samuel L. Jackson as big boss Nick Fury and theres more than enough starry charisma to go around. The film -- like most films like it -- takes a little too long to set up its team. (TVs Mr. Phelps did it best and quickest by simply flipping through a few Impossible Mission Force head shots). Whedon is still more of a sly writer than an eye-catching visualist too. (He only seems to remember hes shooting a 3D movie in the last half hour.) And Im sorry but this is now the third-go-round for the Hulk in less than a decade and hes still too big and still too much of an obviously software-generated cartoon. How hard is this? People get right next film -- or Hulk smash. But -- as the great Stan Lee himself would observe -- nuff said. This is the kind of rally fans have been dreaming about since Jacksons Nick Fury showed up uncredited in the first ""Iron Man"" to start putting this team together. Except the folks our superheroes are fighting for this time are us. Ratings note The film contains some strong language and violence. The Avengers (PG-13) Disney (142 min.) Directed by Joss Whedon. With Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Scarlett Johansson Jeremy Renner Samuel L. Jackson. Now playing in New Jersey.

The Avengers Good to great Director Joss Whedon. Cast Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson. Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout and a mild drug reference. MORE HOTLIST 10 misunderstood movie superheroes INTERVIEWS Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man Mark Ruffalo The Hulk Samual L. Jackson Nick Fury Director Joss Whedon Chris Hemsworth Thor Chris Evans Captain America Tom Hiddleston Loki Cast But the real hero here is Joss Whedon who directs the film with a fanboys enthusiasm and a thorough knowledge of the genre. He manages to corral all of the heroes and all of their egos for a common purpose. A dual purpose actually -- saving the world from bad guys and creating what looks to be almost the perfect summer blockbuster. It takes a little while to get going -- and at nearly two-and-a-half hours thats not an inconsiderable thing -- but Whedon uses the beginning of the film both to provide a little back-story for each character to get the uninitiated up to speed and to set in motion the conflicts between them. These are disparate personalities with individual gifts; each is damaged in some way. So its no surprise to paraphrase Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) that none of them play well with others. Thats true of Stark who is also Iron Man most of all. But circumstances demand cooperation. Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the adopted and exceptionally bitter brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) has cooked up a scheme that involves enslaving Earth that involves the Tesseract an otherworldly source of evidently limitless power. Understanding exactly how this works is thankfully not a requirement of enjoying the movie. You just need to know that its a bad thing. Loki comes down from his realm of Asgard and starts menacing the planet so Agent Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) works to get the gang together. In addition to Stark Fury and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) call on the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) dredge up Steve Rogers -- Captain America (Chris Evans) -- and seek out Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) -- but not Fury insists Banners alter-ego the Hulk. (Good luck with that.) They manage to capture Loki but it all seems a little too easy. Eventually Thor comes along and they all end up together on an invisible floating aircraft carrier. I know I know. That sounds stupid. And maybe outside the context of the universe Whedon creates it is. But here its not -- Whedons investment in building this world is so complete that it captures the audience as well. Thats maybe his biggest success -- making ""The Avengers"" so entertaining that you dont have to be a fanboy to commit to it (though it certainly doesnt hurt). The story is set up so that the characters wind up together in pairs and small groups working out their problems. And its great. The banter the wit is a Whedon trademark (he co-wrote the story) and hes got a group of actors here who rise to the challenge of his words. That suits Downey -- and Stark -- perfectly of course. But it works for everyone; the scenes between Stark and Banner as they try to out-geek each other in the lab are great as is the showdown between Rogers and Stark. Edward Norton played the Hulk in one of the previous films and was an inspired choice. Ruffalo replaces him here and is also outstanding as Banner. But the Hulk is even better. Yes theres as much CGI as acting talent involved but the Hulk gets a lot of the big laughs and there are a gracious plenty. It wouldnt work as well without a satisfying bad guy and Hiddleston is tremendous as Loki. He played the role well in ""Thor"" but he ups his game here. He has a ludicrous unearned swagger that Hiddleston captures perfectly. The effects are of course top-notch. Plenty of buildings get destroyed in proper superhero-film fashion. But thats not what youre likely to remember when you leave ""The Avengers."" More likely youll keep replaying the dialogue in your head the back-and-forth between the characters. Ultimately thats what makes this hero movie truly super. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Review Marvels The Avengers does it right - Mercury News Hot Topics Big Sur fire Balloon crash No-parachute skydive Deadline 29 to Vegas Sheryl Sandbergs Option B Steve Torrence Ask Amy Comics SV150 Print Email Font ResizeReview Marvels The Avengers does it rightBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury NewsPosted 04/30/2012 055606 PM PDTUpdated 08/16/2012 023531 PM PDT Have your say Poll Who is your favorite Avenger? Not all superhero movies scale great heights. Despite the hype last years ""Green Lantern"" couldnt hold a candle to much of anything let alone Christopher Nolans Batman series. ""Wolverine"" was an outright dog ""Spider-Man 3"" a tangled mess.Now along comes ""Marvels The Avengers"" and were reminded theres a way to do it right. Joss Whedons take on the Marvel collection of good guys is about as great as a superhero movie can get. Its bursting with imaginative action jacked up on clever dialogue directed with fanboy exuberance and teeming with well-drawn Marvel comic-book icons -- Iron Man Thor Captain America the Hulk Black Widow Hawkeye and Nick Fury. Most remarkable is its pacing and how smoothly this mammoth potentially unwieldy production runs ... and runs ... and runs until it finishes with a smashing special effects smackdown on the streets of Manhattan.Assembling such a massive cast of larger-than-life characters and actors some of whom we know can wield superhero egos of their own making is a risky proposition ripe with potential for spotlight-hogging. But ""Buffy the Vampire Slayers"" Whedon who directs and co-wrote the hip frequently laugh-out-loud funny screenplay with Zak Penn respectfully grants equal playing time to each character. Moreover the move allows the actors to not only impress us with their lean torsos but demonstrate their acting muscle. The result is one of the most winning displays of teamwork since the San Francisco Giants captured the World Series in 2010. Advertisement After a fast-paced opening the film does take some time to find its legs and the exposition seems unavoidable since the superheroes need to be reintroduced. But once it hits the highway the action moves like a Lamborghini. The plot is fondly and appropriately rooted in comic book tradition -- theres a power-mad villain with a sinister plan. That part falls on the antlers of Loki (Tom Hiddleston) introduced last year in the Kenneth Branagh-directed ""Thor."" Loki the bad-boy brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) plunks down on Earth so he can steal an all-powerful energy source called the Tesseract which is a big glowing cube.Get movie showtimes Theaters and midnight movie showtimes for The Avengers None of that sits well with the crafty Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) from the covert S.H.I.E.L.D. organization. He summons a team of superheroes -- dubbed the Avengers -- to save the world and maybe set up a sequel -- or three.As youd expect getting everyone on the same superhero page isnt easy but its that tension between their dissimilar personalities that gives the story a compelling dramatic arc. It also allows the stars a chance to do some real acting delineating their characters strengths and weaknesses in a way you cant see when the storys all about just one of them. The friction is particularly evident in the exchanges between Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Chris Evans). As the sharply focused script probes the psyches of both men the cocky wisecracking Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) clashes mightily with the by-the-book sincerity of Steve Rogers (aka Captain America). The rest in the cast all hold their own. Scarlett Johansson is sexy and tough as the cunning and acrobatic Black Widow. Jeremy Renner further cements his new action star status as he slings his arrows as Hawkeye. Hemsworth as Thor shows why hes one of our more promising talents. And Jackson -- relegated to tiny teaser roles in previous Marvel films -- gets a chance to do more with the crucial Nick Fury part.The most pleasant surprise though is Mark Ruffalo who is the best Hulk on film to date (sorry Eric Bana and Edward Norton). As the brilliant seemingly mild-mannered scientist with Jekyll and Hyde issues Ruffalo makes Bruce Banner an eccentric loner living in fear of himself. While everyone in the cast suits up like a pro the person responsible for making ""Avengers"" such a smashing success is Whedon. He loads this blockbuster with clever unexpected touches -- like the guy who plays a video game aboard the airborne headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. Even those who dont know a Marvel hero from a DC caped crusader will find themselves having a grand time. Thats because Whedon manages to tap the inner fanboy and fangirl dormant in us all.

"The Avengers (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Avengers (PG-13) The wildly anticipated Marvel Comics epic doesnt live up to expectations. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/1/2012 Editor rating 2 The Hulk is the green one. Captain America is the one with the shield. Iron Man is the one in the tin suit. Thor is the one who is also a god. Writer-director Joss Whedon? Hes Miracle Man - the one tasked with making a watchable movie out of The Avengers. This turns out to be a lot more difficult than it seemed. Originally hired only to work on the script Whedon was asked to also direct the movie on the strength of his vision (The Dirty Dozen with superheroes) and the skill of his previous film Serenity another pop sci-fi adventure with a large cast of complicated characters. Serenity which was a spin off of a failed TV series but was perfectly accessible to newcomers was rousing and funny and fresh and it bore all of Whedons hallmarks too Witty dialogue playful humor deft ensemble work surprising turns of plot and exciting unexpected bursts of action. But Serenity was a small movie by Hollywood standards. The Avengers is an enormous costly enterprise (it looks so big and expensive) and Whedon who seems to have gotten in over his head struggles to keep this unwieldy movie spinning. He is so preoccupied with the sheer physicality of the thing that he doesnt have time to step back and consider the larger picture. He drowns in the details. The Avengers is peppered with memorable bits (pretty much anytime Robert Downey Jr. says anything) and a few raise-the-roof moments (Hulk steals the show). But the bright spots are fleeting and inconsequential and they dont add up to anything. This is a long talky clunky movie that culminates with a huge action sequence. From Whedon you expected more than spectacle. Even though the histories of its characters had been established in earlier movies The Avengers still feels like an origin tale - something you have to push through before you get to the good stuff. The preceding films bore distinct personalities Iron Man was slick and modern Thor channeled Shakespearean bombast Captain America embraced old-fashioned patriotism. Whedon opts for earnestness resulting in a Cuisinart tone. The movie constantly switches gears depending on who happens to be onscreen. It waffles. Most of the actors have grown comfortably into their parts and inhabit them convincingly. In Tony Stark Downey has found his signature role (this is the one well remember him by). Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth invest Captain America and Thor with subtle humor and Marvel newcomer Mark Ruffalo brings a welcome sense of rumpled menace to the anger-prone Bruce Banner. Only Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) come off as actors playing dress-up. But despite the assured performances The Avengers is unconvincing The illusion doesnt stick. The story ties itself into knots to rationalize why these disparate superheroes would ever band together under the supervision of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to thwart the villainous Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Right from the opening scene a belabored set piece boasting one of the most listless car chases ever filmed the movie feels off. Everyone talks too much. The pace lumbers. Extraneous characters eat up screen time. You hunker down in your seat and shrug it off patiently waiting for the film to kick into gear. By the end youre still waiting. Whedon obviously loves these characters and hes well steeped in Marvel Comics lore. In The Avengers the good guys often fight against each other the way they did in the books settling their differences while learning to work as a team. The movie makes room for several fun brawls (a highlight Hulk vs. Thor) and those scenes ring with the thrill and tickle of wish-fulfillment fantasy Theyre all that fans could have possibly wanted. But for everything the film gets right Whedon counters with a questionable decision. In one sequence he repeatedly cuts away from the main action to show Iron Man and Captain America fixing an engine (). Late in the film Nick Fury runs outside to fire a rocket launcher and the throwaway moment stands out as a sop to the character - the only instance in the film where Jackson isnt standing around spouting exposition. This is the kind of gear-grinding that constantly sticks out in The Avengers You notice all the little details that should have been invisible such as how inordinately long it takes for Hawkeye to run out of arrows or how sparsely populated the streets of New York City are during an attack by an intergalactic army. The best comic book movies (Spider-Man 2 The Dark Knight Superman 2) pay off with a climax that grips you emotionally as well as viscerally. The Avengers has a knockout final 30 minutes all gee-whiz crash and bang and eye candy that makes grand use of 3D and IMAX and all the other toys. But the Transformers movies did that too. And theres nothing else here - no surprises or turns other than a shockingly lazy use of a nuclear deus ex machina. Why has The Avengers elicited such rabid near-unanimous pre-release love from critics and audiences? Im not sure but consider this At a recent preview screening a short scene during the end credits elicited a roar of surprised hoots and hollers (including mine) from the audience. But later talking to people in the lobby I couldnt find anyone who knew  what we had just seen in that teaser. Why did everyone get so excited and cheer then? Maybe its because we love these characters so much were willing to embrace anything Whedon serves us because he has obvious respect and affection for the material. We want the movie to be great. Good intentions though arent enough. A serviceable but uninspired franchise launcher The Avengers sends you home full but unfulfilled to which everyone at Marvel Films would probably say ""Maybe you need to see it again."" The 3D will cost you extra though. Cast Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Scarlett Johansson Jeremy Renner Tom Hiddleston Samuel L. Jackson Stellan Skarsgard.

"Avengers | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Avengers Print Page Email Page Search Avengers (2012) A "" ""Marvels The Avengers"" ranks among the most entertaining comic book blockbusters ever made."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Avengers(2012)In theaters Friday 4 May 2012Genre Action Adventure Science FictionCast Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans Scarlett Johansson Samuel L. Jackson Chris Hemsworth Gwyneth Paltrow Mark Ruffalo New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (26) Post a Comment  DKsaid on Tuesday April 30 2013 63652 PMLoved the fight scenes between the superheroes.  Many have debated who would win in a fight between one superhero or another.  The Thor and The Hulk fight was fantastic.  In fact The Hulk was super all the time.  The thrashing he gave Loki was one of the best Ive seen in any movie. Agent Romanoff seemed to get in the way of the scenes she was in (why didnt they call her the Black Widow?).  She never got beyond being a female superhero.  It would be ok if a male came to her rescue sometime.  All the other superheroes had to rely on another from time to time but because of perception fears Romanoff cant be seen to need a man to help her or even have any character flaws like the others did.   With the costume she was wearing we didnt even get sexy out of her either.  In the final battle (somehow large alien metal armored soldiers were vulnerable to arrows and pistol bullets) for a better story it should have been Hawkeye to close the portal to avenge his treatment at the hands of Loki but Romanoff got in the way. new trailerssaid on Thursday July 05 2012 100628 PMThis too-long adventure is a sensory overload --- complete with loud protracted battle scenes and hunky super heroes who provide the necessary eye candy. Its also very funny and highly entertaining. Chrissaid on Tuesday May 29 2012 113523 PMIt has a good amount of action with comedy (so many memorable lines) thrown in it. Some may complain that the plot development in The Avengers was too simplistic but this movie was the culmination of what was set up in the previous Marvel movies. After you watch them the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. online moviessaid on Sunday May 20 2012 55222 AMall my heros in a movie ....see this and my so heppy Swindlersaid on Monday May 07 2012 113623 AMOK I saw THE AVENGERS yesterday and it was better than I expected i kept waiting wath was going to happened next and I note that my hands were sweting I was tense. Many exciting and funny moments acting was basically outstanding each character with their own differences took the atention even Pots wow Ill see it again there where amazing acting moments definetelly the best Superhero movie by far... The Hulk reinvindicated Wow Stark stole the show Captain America the wisest Black Widow was SUPERB in every aspect THOR really changed for good Ruffalo has magical acting skills as always very interesting Bruce Banner. Hawkeye was ok but I would espect more in another take... The movie was so neat in 3D its simply a Gem Rafsaid on Friday May 04 2012 55453 PMthought it was way too over the top. plus the plot was pretty dull and undercooked. there were funny moments though and it was exciting at times. TDKR will be way better Kevin Klawittersaid on Friday May 04 2012 121823 PMHeres my review of ""The Avengers"" James Smith said on Wednesday May 02 2012 103912 AMBryan You are right I havent looked at the comics in a long time and appreciate being corrected. I will correct your presumption about me it wasnt the race pot I was attempting to stir but the P.C. pot. As I said I would just as bothered if the races were reversed. In The Year of the Dragon a female reporter who is white in the novel was played by an Asian actress which changed an important aspect of the plot. I understand that changing Nick Furys race doesnt change anything else about him OR the plot of this movie I just like to see movies be faithful to their source. Okay? Gustavosaid on Tuesday May 01 2012 105846 PMOne of the best critics great review. I saw the movie yesterday its amazing. Bryansaid on Tuesday May 01 2012 52615 PMJames Smith Allow me to ""nerd out"" on you here. In response to your question about whether Samuel L. Jackson should play Nick Fury I encourage you to check out the ""Ultimate Marvel"" universe. Starting over 10 years ago this is a new telling of the Marvel characters including a seminal series called ""Ultimates"" which is essentially the Avengers. In the Ultimate Marvel universe Nick Fury is African-American and not only that he has the face of Samuel L. Jackson The Ultimates is really the model for the Marvel movies and Samuel L. Jackson said he HAD to play Nick Fury - because after all he already IS Nick Fury. I understand you are looking to stir the race pot for some unknown reason but you should have researched further and you clearly havent paid attention to Marvels best stuff for many years.

Earths mightiest heroes battle an alien villain. (223) PG-13 Comic-book violence. Opens Friday at area theaters. If superhero movies now shoulder the responsibility of being our eras moral parables then ""The Avengers"" is a rocket-powered boost to the tops of mounts Olympus Rushmore and Sinai. Or in less highfalutin words Folks these flicks dont get any better than this. Directed by Joss Whedon and tying together the ""Iron Man"" ""Incredible Hulk"" ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" movies this mega-entertaining ""Avengers"" film is something comic fans have dreamed of since Marvel debuted the title almost 50 years ago. RELATED HOW MARVEL STUDIOS ASSEMBLED THE AVENGERS RELATED MEET THE WOMEN OF THE AVENGERS RELATED THE SUPER WOMEN BEHIND THE AVENGERS The filmmakers -- including Whedon and co-writer Zak Penn -- are aware of the power they wield and so make sure the movie not only meets expectations but also is accessible to everyone. They succeed with flying colors injecting our real world with Marvel-style myth. They even make sure to frame the cast in several valiant poster-ready tableaux. After seeing those 12-year-old boys and their dads should be ready to decide who theyd be. As for the (slightly dense) plot things start fast. As scientists examine the Tesseract -- a blue cube first seen in last years ""Captain America"" and ""Thor"" that opens a door to other worlds -- the evil demigod Loki (Tom Hiddleston) emerges from it and starts turning men into minions including government agent Clint ""Hawkeye"" Barton (Jeremy Renner). In response Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents including Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) kick-start the Avengers Initiative bringing together Tony ""Iron Man"" Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) the once-frozen WWII hero Steve ""Captain America"" Rogers (Chris Evans) and split personality Dr. Bruce ""Hulk"" Banner (Mark Ruffalo). PHOTOS THE AVENGERS HIT THE RED CARPET RELATED AVENGERS STARS SWOOP IN TO CLOSE TRIBECA Once the Asgardian god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) hits Earth to deal with his half-brother Loki the team is in place. But that doesnt mean they fit. Intrapersonal conflicts nearly derail the mission (there are super-sized egos and super-issues involved). Stark provokes man-out-of-time Captain America whose powers were funded by Starks dad. Thor for his part considers Loki a family issue. And Banner works at keeping calm so he doesnt turn into a huge green rage monster till the time is right. Whedon avoids choppy whiplash-edited action scenes in favor of a measured elegance. And his genre sensibility is pop-retro; if you cant quite hear pages turn you can certainly let your eyes linger (especially during one panorama-style shot set to Alan Silvestris lush John Barry-style score that locates each hero mid-fight). This is how it should be Everythings in its place so why rush? Most refreshingly these ultra-powered characters are ultra-human. Funny conflicted and in need of guidance they also know how to put on a good show -- a handy trait when youre wearing spandex and armor costumes. The film does too. Lokis appearance at a German opera house is a classic grandstanding villain scene halted by Captain Americas mighty shield. And whereas the mid-section features a battle in a contained space -- S.H.I.E.L.D.s invisible flying battleship -- the final 40 minutes is a massive rumble across Manhattan as Lokis alien army and their giant flying bug-things burn the city until the Avengers assemble to thwart them. We wouldnt care about them collectively if we didnt know them individually and it helps to have four Oscar nominees in this bunch. Ruffalo is the revelation turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano (and his CGI Hulk actually provides big laughs). Evans conveys Captain Americas confusion at being decades away from home and Downeys Stark is again a wisecracking wonder with a heart that cracks when a member of the film series is lost. They anchor a superb group effort. Most impressive of all ""The Avengers"" makes superhero movies new again -- a colossal task indeed. Magic Moment The colorful cast rally in a circle as they prepare for battle.

By David Edelstein Published ShareThis Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans in The Avengers.  (Photo Zade Rosenthal (c) 2011 Marvel) Apart from being supersmart Joss Whedon has the perfect credentials to write and direct a colossal commercial construct like Marvels The Avengers He plainly loves the opportunity to put these comic-book iconsIron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) Captain America (Chris Evans) the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth)in one room and let them hang out spar (with words as well as hammers shields etc.) and weigh the merits of individualism versus teamwork. Reallydebate is as important to him as Hulk smash The movie would be all over the place if not for Whedons centrifugal seriousness. And it would be overbearingly pompous if not for his nifty ability to spoof his subjects without devaluing them. Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other Whedon wonders The Avengers is both campy and reverential. Comic-Con nerds will have multiple orgasms. I had a blast. I also as I watched thought Wow that must have cost a lot of money money money waves of money. There arent many shots without fancy CGI or mighty sets occupied by dreamy men and women with finely sculpted bottoms. Even if scenes of superheroes whooshing around Manhattan and battling an armada from the realm of Asgard look like video games you have to admire a hot-dog shot like the one in which the camera zigs and zags to catch every single Avenger in midair bashing and crashing and hammering for all theyre worth (plenty). The frames have the thrust of good comic-book illustrations without overdoing it and Whedon picks his moments to come at ya with 3-D Here and there a spear will tickle your nostril hairs. On the human front the stunt doublesespecially Scarlett Johanssons whose name is I swear Heidi Moneymakerare gratifyingly elastic. You might as well revel in this thing. Its like all-day room service at the Ritz. The villain introduced in Thor is called Loki and played by Tom Hiddleston whose name invokes dyslexiaI always type Tim Huddleston. By any name hes a magnificently theatrical presence. Hes after a tesseract that will open a portal to Asgard. The larger point is that he wants to free the world from freedom. He thinks that deep down humans long to follow orders reminding Captain Americatransformed from a puny dork to fight the Nazisof another mad Fascist. The Avengers have a hard time focusing on Loki though since they drive one another loco. We all like to play the game Who would win in a fight Dracula or Frankenstein? King Kong or Godzilla? Palin or Bachmann? Here you get shield versus hammer. Hammer versus iron suit. Shield versus Hulk. Nobody wins but a lot of trees windows and expensive-looking control panels lose. Samuel L. Jacksons S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Nick Fury lectures his wayward charges like the worlds dullest headmaster. (Jackson brings nothing to the part.) For some reason Whedon has the obnoxious Tony Stark (Downey) work on Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) whos diligently practicing anger management to let out his inner Hulk as if their flying battleship is some kind of est seminar. Shambling attractively mussed Ruffalo ignores him and steals every scene. Whedon gives some sweet moments to Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson now part government liaison part fanboy. He gets especially moony around Evanss rather colorless Captain whose most expressive feature is his muscular torso. Multiple protagonists means that by the time youve had your fill of snotty Iron Man you get the wooden Captain and when youre bored with the Captain you get the Norse hottie. Or Johansson who comes into her own. Over the years Johanssons once-refreshing self-confidence has become an irritant (the vibe is now snobbish) but her Natasha RomanoffBlack Widow is a treat her deadpan prickling with rage and hurt. The Avengers is full of terrific comebacks (Captain We need a plan of attack. Iron Man I have a planattack) and Whedon never lets us forget that in the words of one bureaucrat the fate of the human race has been left to a handful of freaks. The problem is what now? Can we watch another Iron Man flick without thinking Why doesnt he get on the phone to Banner? Natasha is rested and ready. Thor is just a portal away. Were spoiled. Well always be thinking Show me the money A charming funny reactionary mating comedy from the Judd Apatow factory The Five-Year Engagement is about a rising San Francisco chef Tom (Jason Segel) who sets aside his career to relocate to a less-desirable city (Ann Arbor) when his fiancee Violet (Emily Blunt) gets into a prestigious academic programand feels his manhood slipping away. Thats what a fella can expect when he puts his woman first. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Photo Marvel The Avengers"" is neither overwhelming nor underwhelming. What it expertly is is whelming. Iron Man shooting through the gastrointestinal tract of a giant space lizard like atomic vindaloo? WHELM Hulk and Thor going at it on a ripped-up plane a la Itchy and Scratchy? WHELM Hordes of alien supertroopers hurtling into town at Grand Central Terminal with a singularity of purpose suggesting Long Island boys getting off the train on St. Patricks Day? WHELM All of this blockbustery business is pleasing enough but the surprising secret of Joss Whedons film is this Its best when the finally gathered Marvel Comics heroes Thor Iron Man Hulk and Captain America are just sitting around ragging on each other as though lounging in Central Perk. Yes this is at heart super-""Friends"" a surprisingly witty comedy with a comic book wrapped around it. I wont bore you with the details -- mainly because the details bored me and I cant explain them anyway. Theres this little crystal cube called the Tesseract from the world of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and his evil brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston). ""I am Loki of Asgard and I am burdened with glorious purpose"" he declares in a line of glorious awesomeness. Everyone wants the Tesseract because its a portal to the other world and/or a potential source of limitless power. SECOND OPINION THE AVENGERS Its being guarded by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) the shop steward of the superheroes union S.H.I.E.L.D. but Loki slips onto Earth to steal it while using a mind trick to persuade S.H.I.E.L.D.s birdlike chief archer Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to turn evil. Now its time to gather the good guys. Round up the usual spandex This takes time Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) doesnt appear until nearly 20 minutes in and Thor 20 minutes after that. But Whedon understands that if you dont establish the characters it wont be possible to make us care when its time to rumble. So I enjoyed both Tony Starks cute banter with his now-girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Black Widows (Scarlett Johansson) recruitment of Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) who has fled to India after his alter ego the Hulk as he puts it ""Uh broke . . . Harlem."" Ruffalo (replacing the so-so Edward Norton) is ideal playing Banner as a calm secure problem-solver carefully walling himself off from what he calls ""the other guy."" Once gathered along with Chris Evans Captain America (who seems to bore Whedon and isnt given enough to do) the gang imprison Loki on their airship. He gets to messing with everyones minds Hannibal Lecter-style and though this scene is slightly forced (if not as forced as a silly fight between Iron Man and Thor) its amusing to see the teammates personalities clash. Captain Americas un-ironic loyalty honesty and respect for chain of command for instance grate on the self-centered cynical and iconoclastic Tony Stark while Thor and Hulk are as wary of one another as any other roid ragers. Downey gets much of the best dialogue. When Thor (who is wearing antlers and an acre of velour) shouts ""You dont know who youre dealing with"" Stark replies ""Shakespeare in the Park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?"" One minute hes buddies with Banner because theyre both science geeks the next hes tweaking him for being ""an enormous green rage monster."" Such is Whedons skilled playfulness that without the movie getting too self-referential everyone gets plenty of sharp lines even the pilot trying to shoot down Hulk who says ""Target engaged . . . Target angry"" Reaching for a bit of the underlying seriousness of ""The Dark Knight"" though Whedon cant quite grasp it. He raises an interesting point by Loki that man loves to be subjugated but doesnt flesh it out (though he does bring in an awkward reference to Hitlers spell over Germany). Then its time for the booming and crashing to begin with a gigantic climax centered on Tony Starks (imaginary) new Manhattan HQ near Grand Central over which the alien portal to a nasty universe busts open. Theres far too much merry chaos going on for any of it to really thrill and working in all of these characters is inherently about as graceful as cat juggling. Still Whedon keeps up the energy and keeps it good-humored. Id rather watch Tony quip than Hulk smash or Thor hammer but then again the ripping mayhem of the finale illustrates an ancient truth We all know that family reunions have a way of getting out of hand.

Its a fun party too bustling to worry about greatness. By Richard Corliss April 25 2012 Share Read Later MVLFFLLC / Marvel Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture A man turns to watch the climactic chaos that has Iron Man Thor the Hulk Hawkeye Black Widow and Captain America battling an alien invasion near Manhattans Grand Central Terminal. ""Superheroes in New York?"" he sneers. ""Gimme a break."" The man is Stan Lee chief dreamer-upper of those muscular dudes a half-century ago in the pages of Marvel comics making a cameo appearance in Marvels The Avengers. The movie -- which opens this week in most of the world and May 4 in North America -- marks a slam-bang convention of superheroes a ComicCon nerds multiple orgasm and the first maybe the biggest blockbuster of summer 2012. Gimme a break? A hundred million fans will shout Gimme more Marvel has been planning this soiree for ages. It salted the ground and whetted audiences appetites with the Iron Man movies (Robert Downey Jr. as arms-merchant-turned-flying-guy Tony Stark) in 2008 and 2010 the Incredible Hulk reboot (Edward Norton as Bruce Banner the physicist with anger-management issues) in 2008 and last years Thor (Chris Hemsworth as the hammer-happy Nordic god) and Captain America The First Avenger (Chris Evans as the 97-pound-weakling given heroic bulk by World War II scientists). (SEE TIMEs Top 10 Superhero Movies) Joining this quartet are two prime Avengers who somehow never got their own movies femme fatale Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) the Black Widow who abetted Stark in Iron Man 2 and from Thor the brooding Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) whose archery skills earned him the name Hawkeye. Those not familiar with the comic-book companys pantheon may need to be told that Spider-Man the X-Men the Fantastic Four Daredevil Blade and dozens of other studs occupy different corners of the Marvel universe. The Greeks didnt have this many deities. For the ultimate union-reunion the Lee team called on writer-director Joss Whedon whose inspired toying with genre tropes gave birth or at least new life to TVs Buffy the Vampire Slayer Angel and Dollhouse plus the recent smarty-pants horror comedy The Cabin in the Woods and the Internet miniseries Dr. Horribles Sing-Along Blog a musical comedy whose self-reflexive ingenuity was topped only by its all-sung DVD commentary. (MORE TIMEs review of The Cabin in the Woods) Reworking Zak Penns original Avengers script Whedon sat on his usual impulse to go meta; instead he served as expert mixologist for this all-star cocktail party. The movie guarantees fast-paced fun without forcing anyone to think about what it all means which is nothing. ""A poem should not mean / but be"" Archibald MacLeish wrote. A pop-culture smash should not mean but do break stuff agitate the senses keep the customer satisfied. The Avengers doesnt aim for transcendence only for the jugglers skill of keeping the balls smoothly airborne and in 3-D too (converted after production). At that it succeeds. In essence a sequel to Thor the movie posits that the blond musclemans dark anemic adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) after plunging into a wormhole at the end of last years film has gained possession of the Tesseract a cosmic cube that contains not only the secret of infinitely replenishable energy but a two-way door to the cosmos. Recognizing this imminent threat to the world nay the solar system S.H.I.E.L.D. lord Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles the far-flung Avengers to face down Loki and his robot army. A floating aircraft carrier -- the films coolest visual effect -- serves as the temporary barracks for this all-star crew until the big climactic battle. (MORE TIMEs review of Thor) Whedon has said that what drew him to the movie is the disparity of the various Avengers ""These people shouldnt be in the same room let alone on the same team -- and that is the definition of family."" For a while The Avengers becomes a 200-million mass-market version of one of those indie films about a dysfunctional family whose members come home for the holidays and rip off all the old scabs. And with six superheroes fighting for screen time the combat sure is as strenuous among them as between them and Loki. Each has a powerful personality and four of them have starred in their own movies; so a good chunk of The Avengers involves the collision of star egos as if the aircraft carrier were a benefit-concert green room stuffed with celebrities bickering over billing. Thor for example spits darts at Loki in iambic heptameter (""You take the world as recompense for your imagined slight"") an antique flossiness that immediately exasperates Starks Iron Man. ""Now theres this guy"" he sneers. ""Shakespeare in the Park."" They have a fight strength against strength ending in Thors WWE head butt; when Captain America arrives to call a truce he gets rocked as well. This clash of the titans is also a mashup of acting styles -- Hemsworths grandiloquence vs. Evanss naivete vs. the Method questing of Mark Ruffalo who replaced Norton as Bruce Banner -- while Downeys snarky Stark provides the movies internal joking DVD commentary but spoken not sung. (MORE TIMEs review of Captain America The First Avenger) Ruffalo whos done many a Sundance drama has called Banner/The Hulk ""my generations Hamlet"" -- though anger not indecision is his characters tragic flaw. The actor performs as if taking direction in improv theater from the late John Cassavetes. And the funny thing is it works here since Banner is supposed to be a creature apart reining in his Hulk impulses until theyre useful in the group effort. He gets the best line when he asks ""What are we a team? No a time bomb."" Indeed the Avengers are so busy arguing that they miss Lokis first major onslaught. Defense of the planet delayed on account of infighting. OK so its tough being a superhero. Stark refers to his Iron Man powers as ""a terrible privilege"" and Banner says the Hulkamania roiling inside him is not a gift ""its a nightmare."" The supervillain also claims to have problems. ""I am burdened with a glorious purpose"" Loki says as if wreaking holocaustal havoc were a solemn duty not a giddy treat. But he has fun nonetheless more than any of his good-guy adversaries; after all there are six of them and just one of him. And just as World War II hero Captain America was thawed out a couple of generations later to help fight some intergalactic Axis powers so Loki has the vibe of an 80s heavy-metal star of Druidic bent pried from his crypt and ready to give the universe a final Spinal Tap. As Stark aptly opines about medieval demon-god ""Hes a full-tilt diva."" (MORE TIMEs review of the 2008 Incredible Hulk) When Loki isnt pulverizing midtown Manhattan hes preening like a Ziegfeld showgirl and disgorging contemptuous aphorisms in the manner of an Oscar Wilde dandy with Tourettes. He uncoils a string of lurid threats Natashas way capping the torrent by calling her ""You mewling quim"" (That may be the first joking yoking of those two words in a century or so of pop culture.) Loki needs a good Asgard-kicking and will get one from the Avengers but his definitive putdown comes when just to flex his nastiness he materializes in front of the Stuttgart Opera House to send a thousand Germans quivering in fear. ""In the end"" Loki says ""you will always kneel."" An old man (Kenneth Tigar) possibly a survivor of Hitlers ovens pipes up ""Not to men like you."" His grandeur enraged Loki spumes ""There are no men like me"" And the old German whispers perhaps from memory ""There are always men like you."" In Marvel-land there are always and almost only men. A cosmos created and illustrated by comic-book guys for comic-book boys and brought to the screen by later platoons of males is by definition homoheroic if not homoerotic. The movies tenderest relationship is between Captain America and his No. 1 fan S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) who asks nothing more than that the good Captain autograph the Agents superhero card set. Theres little room for women except of the cartoon variety the nasty spy Natasha first seen in Madonna bustier and high heels manacled to a chair in a sadistic interrogation. That she uses all these elements to secure her freedom is a nice Whedon touch but also a tribute to the seductive gravity Johansson lends to her character. (MORE TIMEs review of the first and best Iron Man) At the end Natasha shows shes a good soldier vanquishing a regiment of cyborg grunts and fighting off Lokis biggest weapon a monstrosaurus that flies through Manhattan like the Japanese turtle-lizard Gamera and crashes becomingly into the Main Concourse of Grand Central Terminal. The movies climactic inspiration is to use the gleaming Deco spire of the Chrysler Building just a block away to conduct electricity back to the Tesseract. By then Whedon has given all the stars their closeups on the way to restoring order to the universe -- the Marvel universe that is. Sequels to Iron Man and Thor are due next year with the whole gang coming a bit after that in an endless separating and recombination of the central team. The new enterprise is just one lavish element in the grand design. With plenty of incident but limited glimpses into each superheros soul the picture falls short of the finest Marvel film the original Iron Man. For all the entertainment value of Whedons film the question lingers Is The Avengers too much for one movie or not enough?

Not content with co-writing and producing the best film of the year so far the berserk horror romp The Cabin in the Woods hes now scripted and directed its biggest. And if Avengers Assemble doesnt feel quite as irreducibly Whedon-esque as Cabin it retains enough of his trademark off-kilter wit and attention to character to set it high above your average multiplex crowd-pleaser.For those unfamiliar with the Marvel canon the Avengers comics unite superheroes from across the companys roster in this case - deep breath - Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Captain America (Chris Evans) The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and lesser-known caped crusaders Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Brought together by Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) and his SHIELD organisation these six ass-kicking egomaniacs are tasked with taking on Loki (Tom Hiddleston) who plans to flood the world with evil skeleton monsters from outer space.Its not rare to see a blockbuster skimp on plot but that tendency is taken to new extremes here the story is just a bare frame on which Whedon hangs his characters and action sequences. This can lead to problems when we realise that Loki aside we dont know who the bad guys are where they come from or what they want.But that - and a handful of dodgy CGI effects - is the only major fault with Avengers Assemble. This is as close as cinema gets to a fairground ride its shiny noisy and exhilarating. Whedon directs with a sledgehammer bashing the audience Hulk-like with action piled upon action explosion after explosion. And if it can at times seem a little busy the cumulative effect is thrilling.But its no surprise that Whedons true strength is as a writer. Marshalling six heroes - and at least as many other key speaking roles - he delineates characters beautifully keeping the macho-bullshit quotient high (Downey Jr and Hemsworth are good value in this department) while also allowing for a few quieter sweeter touches most of them courtesy of Ruffalos battered and defensive Hulk. And in another break from the blockbuster norm he manages to get the villain spot on handing Hiddleston a gift of a role as Loki and one of the most memorably nasty insults in recent screen history.Avengers Assemble may not be the Joss Whedon movie everyone remembers in 2012 but it does offer this hugely talented writer-director - too long confined to TV and the web - the opportunity (and the budget) to show what hes capable of.

To put it simply I really enjoyed it - it was funny and action packed and all of the characters had great entrances or cool scenes. The Hulk has always been my favourite and here he is given some of the best scenes and lines that any comic character has had on the big screen. For me Ruffalo brings the most human element to the film (which is ironic given that his alter-ego is a big green monster). Of the Marvel comic films Id say Avengers Assemble is up there with the first Iron Man and light years ahead of the dismal Captain America (which I really wanted to like) and the so-so Thor (which wasnt as bad as I thought it would be).FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 29 2012entertainingFeaturedEnjoyed this but have to agree that the baddies (apart from Loki) are a bit faceless and we dont really get an indication of what their point is other than kill all humans. I had a bit of a problem with how powerful the Hulk was portrayed to be - I thought he was meant to just be extremely strong - but here hes leaping around all oer the place at high speed and is apparently stronger than a GOD ?? Apart from this theres quite a lot of genuine humour here and of course Tom Hiddleston steals the show - hes almost too charismatic as often youre sort of rooting for him.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 29 2012JamilFeaturedThis is an outstanding movie with fantastic cgi and strong super hero character depth and well developed together throughout this film.

Such a shame because Whedon is a massive talent and the character material he had to work with is rich but Im sorry - I do not understand all the positive reviews.

The film looks good and yes there is some real humour in the film but the problem is that there is little in the way of plot.

By Christy Lemire Associated Press Posted 04/24/12 1049 AM EDT | Updated on 04/24/2012  Comments The hype has been building for years and it couldnt possibly be more deafening at this point. After a series of summer blockbusters that individually introduced Iron Man The Incredible Hulk Thor and Captain America all these characters come together alongside several other friends and foes in Marvels The Avengers. And with director and co-writer Joss Whedon they couldnt be in better hands. Hes pulled off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast and giving everyone a chance to shine of balancing splashy set pieces with substantive ideology. Stuff gets blowed up real good in beautifully detailed 3-D in The Avengers  the area in and around Grand Central Terminal for example gets obliterated beyond recognition in an exhausting climactic battle  but the film as a whole is never a mess from a narrative perspective. Whedon keeps a tight rein on some potentially unwieldy material and the result is a film that simultaneously should please purists (one of which he is) as well as those who arent necessarily comic-book aficionados. He also stays true to the characters while establishing a tone thats very much his own. As he did with the recent horror hit The Cabin in the Woods which he co-wrote and produced Whedon has come up with a script thats cheeky and breezy full of witty banter and sly pop-culture shout-outs as well as self-referential humor one that moves with an infectious energy that (almost) makes you lose track of its 2-1/2-hour running time. Advertisement The back-and-forth between Robert Downey Jr.s glib Iron Man and Chris Evans old-school Captain America is electric while Downeys more low-key philosophical exchanges with Mark Ruffalos Hulk help give the film some intellectual heft. Actually Downey nearly runs away with this whole thing a tough feat to pull off in a cast full of personalities who are literally larger than life; it just goes to show once again how irresistibly charismatic he can be with the right kind of writing. But the films vibe is never smug or off-putting; these are still comic book heroes full of all the torment and introspection youd expect. And for a movie thats so violent The Avengers ends up being an earnest plea for peace. As in the best of its predecessors the original Iron Man from 2008 its a reminder that a summer blockbuster can be glossy and entertaining but still have meatier matters on its mind. And we havent even gotten to the plot yet Its your basic bad-guy-wants-to-take-over-the-world kinda thing. But even Whedon seems to recognize what a hackneyed premise that is so he has a little fun with it. The preening effete Loki (Tom Hiddleston) the bitter brother of hunky demigod Thor (Chris Hemsworth) descends to Earth from Asgard which still has a distinctly 70s cheesiness about its twinkly sci-fi aesthetic. Once here he steals the Tesseract the cosmic blue cube that gives its bearer unlimited power or some such. The no-nonsense Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) the head of S.H.I.E.L.D.  which had been entrusted with the safety of said cube  springs into action to reacquire it by assembling a dream team of superheroes and other sundry bad-asses with specialized skills. Nick gets help in this endeavor from his right-hand man Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg once again bringing some welcome deadpan humor to this outlandish scenario). Besides Iron Man Thor and Captain America The Hulks services are needed because the Tesseract exudes a radiation that will help track it and The Hulk  despite the threat of his gigantic green volatility  knows a little something about gamma rays. (Ruffalo stepping into the Bruce Banner role that Eric Bana and Edward Norton played previously in the past decade brings a sense of wry bemusement and appealing self-deprecation to this dangerous and misunderstood character.) Theres also master assassin Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and super spy Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). But because these are superheroes with super powers they also have super egos. And so a great deal of time is spent having them talk a lot of trash and square off against one another to prove whos toughest. Theres Iron Man vs. Thor Thor vs. The Hulk Hawkeye vs. Black Widow and so on. While they might seem like filler these showdowns allow each character to have his or her time in the spotlight and they do build genuine tension. They also happen to represent the adolescent fantasies of every geek in the audience. So in theory everyones happy. Eventually they will all have to come together for one epic battle against their shared enemy in Midtown Manhattan home of Iron Man Tony Starks latest dazzling architectural creation his eponymous high-rise and a cool place in general to stage massive movie destruction. Much of the gadgetry is cleverly detailed as youd expect  Tony Stark has devised stunningly efficient ways to get his metal suit on and off  but The Avengers is at its strongest in its quieter simpler moments  when people are actually talking to each other. The dialogue sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but theyre well fleshed-out underneath. And so in every regard this movie truly fulfills its hype. Marvels The Avengers rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action throughout and a mild drug reference runs 143 minutes. 3-1/2 stars out of 4.

However questionable an idea it may have seemed initially and at times along the way Marvels cinematic master plan for its comicbook all-stars pays off in extravagant fashion with ""The Avengers."" Like a superior state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts Joss Whedons buoyant witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story. With fan-ticipation reaching Hulk pressure-cooker levels Disneys domestic and international returns will be nothing short of stratospheric ancillary streams close to eternal. In preparation for this long-anticipated convergence Marvel ambitiously envisioned not one series but an entire family of interlocking self-perpetuating franchises kicking off with 2008s enjoyable ""Iron Man"" and continuing in more erratic fashion with ""The Incredible Hulk"" ""Iron Man 2"" and last years ""Thor"" and ""Captain America The First Avenger."" Under the stewardship of producer and Marvel exec Kevin Feige its been a lucrative enterprise if not a consistently thrilling one and for all but the most die-hard devotees attendance has sometimes seemed a matter of obligation as well as pleasure. ""Stay tuned"" the post-credits teasers may have urged but after awhile they seemed to send a different message ""Bear with us."" ""The Avengers"" fully keeps the promise implicit in that plea taking one of the dominant movie trends of recent years -- the nonstop proliferation of comicbook-based superheroes -- and pushing it to orgiastic new levels of CG-inflated 3D-augmented geek-out mayhem. Expensive and expansive though it may be however the film is no bloated behemoth. As written and directed by the ever genre-savvy Whedon its a clean-burning six-cylinder entertainment that exudes discipline in every particular from the scripts balance of sincerity and self-effacing humor to the well-integrated visual effects to the keen sense of proportion that governs the ensemble. Whenever the possibility of boredom or excess rears its head Whedon finds an elegant solution. Crucially sequences that might have played as laborious buildup are handled in a brisk straight-ahead manner that quickly focuses attention while methodically elevating the stakes scene by scene. A new threat of global annihilation looms from the outset when Thors megalomaniacal brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) arrives on Earth in a petulant huff and steals the Tesseract the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean in ""Captain America."" Overruling his colleagues in the shadowy law-enforcement agency Shield Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) seeks to mobilize an elite squad of save-the-dayers known as the Avengers. A superhero summit is held aboard Furys enormous airship though its more like a misfit meet-and-greet. The script deftly blends comedy tension and on-the-fly character recaps as these life-size action figures some of whom have superhuman egos to match their abilities come into contact. The best lines naturally go to dryly sarcastic playboy billionaire Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) who immediately clashes with earnest WWII relic Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans). An amusing early sequence finds these two squaring off with imperious god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) before they realize they share the same objective Recover the cube before the evil Loki ironically pronounced ""low-key"" harnesses its power to summon a nasty intergalactic army that will enslave humanity. Providing an extra dash of suspense is the deceptively reserved Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) serving in a strictly scientific capacity as his transformation into the uncontrollable Hulk would (and eventually does) threaten the safety of everyone onboard the ship. That includes Furys whip-smart operative Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) who more than holds her own amid all the chrome and testosterone and gets more of a chance to flesh out her troubled backstory here than she did in ""Iron Man 2."" Specifically she has a vested interest in breaking the spell Loki has placed on her old ally Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner briefly glimpsed in ""Thor"") a skilled archer with uniquely deadly arrows. The prior pics tried to position each hero at the center of his own personal psychodrama but here the balance feels right; these fighters work better and hold ones attention more effectively as a unit. In a prime example of Whedons ability to turn problems to his advantage the Hulk seemingly the weakest link in terms of character engagement (Ruffalo is the third actor to play the role in a decade) comes satisfyingly into his own as the Avengers secret weapon. While Downey consistently steals the show with his desert-dry delivery each actor in the freshly re-energized cast gets the chance not only to crack wise but to touchingly express the self-doubt that lies at the heart of every superhero. The inevitable question of whether the world needs this motley crew is answered most sweetly by Shields Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) a series fixture who stands in here for the films targeted fanboy audience. On the other side Hiddleston gamely handles his villain-in-chief duties which mostly consist of issuing petulant putdowns (""You crave subjugation"") to the entirety of the human race. Apart from a punchy setpiece in Stuttgart Germany Whedon confines the action to the airship for much of the picture all the better to maximize the impact of an extended climax that involves as it must the catastrophic destruction of a major metropolis. Most memorable for the image of a giant blue sphincter excreting armed-and-dangerous floaties over the city this endgame is too pro forma to convey real danger images of civilians fleeing en masse notwithstanding. Even still the battles are excitingly staged with a sweep and coherence that actually gain something from the 3D conversion especially when the camera starts to pinball from building to building in a breathless flurry of digital zooms and tracking shots. Production is technically immaculate with Seamus McGarveys lensing as sharp and focused as Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lasseks editing though composer Alan Silvestris big surging themes could have been more commandingly deployed. ""The Avengers"" is the first Marvel production to be released by Disney since it purchased the comicbook giant in 2009 and it wont be the last The coda sets up a sequel that likely wont materialize until after a round of ""Iron Man"" ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" follow-ups that will keep the studio occupied through 2014.

Daily Edition Login to download The Avengers Film Review 901 PM PDT 4/19/2012 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Zack Rosenthal/Marvel Studios The biggest Marvel movie yet destined for the box-office stratosphere. TWITTER Director Joss Whedon pulls off a stunning feat in bringing balance to this superhuman circus engineered to charm the geek core and nonfans alike. The All-Star Game of modern superhero extravaganzas The Avengers is humongous -- the film Marvel and its legions of fans have been waiting for. Its hard to imagine that anyone with an appetite for the trademarks patented brand of fantasy effects mayhem and strangely dressed he-men will be disappointed; not only does this eye-popping 3D display of visual effects fireworks feature an enormously high proportion of action scenes but director Joss Whedon has adroitly balanced the celebrity circus to give every single one of the superstar characters his or her due. Worldwide box-office returns will be in a word Marvelous. VIDEO The Avengers Premiere Red Carpet Interviews During the past several years Marvel has with accelerated speed expanded its cinematic repertoire of over-muscled generally double-identitied heroes not otherwise encumbered by exclusive contracts with other studios -- most notably The Hulk Iron Man Thor and Captain America -- to arrive at the point where this summit meeting of superhuman good guys could be assembled. (A prominent relative Spider-Man has his own reboot coming up this summer.) After this the characters will go their separate ways -- Iron Man 3 starts shooting next month with second chapters of Thor and Captain America set to roll within the year -- before gathering again before too many movie summers pass. With the bundle this one will make the pressure will be on make it happen sooner rather than later. As creatively variable and predictably formulaic as the Marvel films have been this one will not only make the core geek audience feel like its died and gone to Asgard but has so much going for it that many nonfans will be disarmed and charmed. This is effects-driven mass-appeal summer fare par excellence that sought-after rare bird that hits all the quadrants as marketing mavens like to say. As enormous as the production is though the appeal of the ensemble cast makes a crucial difference; you get enough but not too much of each of them and they all get multiple scenes to themselves to shine. PHOTOS Avengers Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals To boil down the particulars of this latest attempt to bring ruin to all we hold dear sinister Thor villain Loki (Tom Hiddleston looking like Richard E. Grants effete younger brother) has gained possession of the tesseract an all-powerful substance contained in an opaque cube that not only provides unlimited sustainable energy but a portal to outer space. ""I am burdened with glorious purpose"" Loki purrs while taunting eye-patched S.H.I.E.L.D. master Samuel L. Jackson (finally with something to do in a Marvel film) with the promised arrival of his army of outer-space warriors. Down but not out the good guys begin assembling on board one of the cooler modes of transport seen anywhere in a while a giant (and beautifully rendered) aircraft carrier that can rise out of the water to become an invisible space ship -- hence a helicarrier -- and serve as a first-rate staging area for operations against Loki. Among those arriving on board are Bruce Banner otherwise known as The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo the third actor after Eric Bana and Edward Norton to give the green giant a big-screen go); Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) a sultry scarlet-haired assassin first seen turning the tables on nasty interrogators despite being strapped to a chair; Thor (Chris Hemsworth) Lokis long-locked brother and bearer of the universes mightiest hammer; and Mr. Old School himself Steve Rogers aka Captain America (Chris Evans) a World War II hero whos not quite up to speed on all the latest super-technology but carries an impenetrable shield. For his part Robert Downey Jr.s Tony Stark better known as Iron Man joins incipient girlfriend Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow) for a brief tete-a-tete before deigning to lend his special expertise to the cause. Although they really should be saving their energy for the battle against Loki and his minions the Avengers team cant resist getting into it with each other from time to time. One could say that this is just gratuitous time-killing but it could as persuasively be argued that watching The Hulk duke it out with Thor for bragging rights as to whos tougher is what such a film is all about; at least theres nothing perfunctory about it as there is when superheroes routinely dispatch aliens and enemies who exist just to get blown away. The friction between Iron Man and Captain America for example is all about style and attitude; the former is far too irreverent and glib for the latter for whom patriotism and coming to the rescue are not laughing matters. PHOTOS 28 of Summers Most Anticipated Movies Avengers Dark Knight Prometheus With only one feature directorial credit to his name the middling 2005 sci-fier Serenity Whedon of Buffy fame would not have been the first name on most peoples lists to tame a potentially unwieldy project. But from a logistical point of view alone he imposes a grip on the material that feels like that of a benevolent general marshaling myriad technical resources (including an excellent use of 3D) while even more impressively juggling eight major characters giving them all cool and important things to do. Never though does the film stall to dwell on individual characters just to give them screen time; the heroes are almost always doing something that relates to the challenge at hand. Even when the impudent Loki is held prisoner in seemingly inescapable circumstances there is still forward movement which crests and then crashes with tsunami force near Grand Central Station in Manhattan; uncountable numbers of alien warriors arrive from the skies accompanied by strikingly designed metal leviathans that undulate like skeletal monsters of the deep as they cruise over New York seeking targets. In this titanic battle which occupies most of the films final half-hour all the Marvel heroes talents are put to the test. In addition to Iron Man making a quick trip to outer space to deal with an incoming missile special agent Clint Barton or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is so good with a high-tech bow and arrow that you imagine theyll have to dragoon Katniss Everdeen into the sequel as a guest star just to see whos better. For his part Jacksons Nick Fury has his hands full restraining army generals from nuking the Big Apple in order to off the aliens. PHOTOS The Avengers Comics vs. Film Its clamorous the save-the-world story is one everyones seen time and again and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish however familiar is irresistibly tasty again. A quick coda reveals to well-versed fans at least who the new adversary in the next installment will be underlining a reality as absolute as the turning of Earth Especially after this Marvel movies will go on and on and on.
