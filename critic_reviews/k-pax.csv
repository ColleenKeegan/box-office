""K-PAX"" gives off a great deal of light but generates little heat in a drama that aspires to cosmic themes but ends up with plain comforting homilies. Taking what in other hands might be a straightforward alien-visits-Earth tale Charles Leavitts script based on Gene Brewers first in a trilogy of novels tries to turn the science-fiction elements upside down as a New York shrink tries to fathom the depths of a new patient who claims to hail from distant planet K-PAX. But the film frustratingly fritters away what fascination it develops and bows to the basic conventions of a standard detective story mixed with the theme of a physician healing himself. Muddled results feel like a betrayal of pics early promise and despite large sections that amount to a two-hander between stars Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges auds may feel let down enough to dampen the ultimate B.O. toward the middle range. While pics most obvious points of reference are ""Field of Dreams"" ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" and ""Starman"" which starred Bridges what ""K-PAX"" most directly recalls is Argentinean directors Eliseo Subielas 1986 ""Man Facing Southeast"" a cult classic that also centers on a psychiatric patient who claims to be an alien visitor. Recent news reports have raised questions about the similarities while noting Brewers claims that he had never seen Subielas film. While the two films are different in a host of details they share many general strokes. Surprisingly director Iain Softley whose previous ""Wings of the Dove"" and ""Hackers"" gave no sense of a director with a bold visual style has expanded a rather straight script into something beautiful to behold. The shadow of Michael Mann seems to loom over every widescreen frame an influence visible in the spare modernist compositions ultra-dramatic close-ups and dominant shades of ethereal color especially blue. Even if by the end the story sends things in a literal Earth-bound direction Softley coaxes every possible bit of magic out of it as if he wanted to beam back up to K-PAX along with his hero. No sooner does Prot (Spacey) appear in Grand Central Station than hes picked up by suspicious NYPD cops -- it seems they dont like how the guy wont take off his sunglasses when asked. As chief of psychiatry at the Psychiatric Institute of Manhattan Dr. Powell (Bridges) knows how to deal with such folk as Ernie (Saul Williams) whose phobias about airborne viruses and chemicals dont sound so crazy these days. But Prot explains right off that his planet is 1000 light years away and responds to Powells question ""Are you sick?"" with a reply that may be a joke or a genuine feeling ""A little homesick."" Such dialogue will be raw meat to lovers of Spaceys performance style as the ultimate ironist. For others theres a sense that Spacey is doing a now-familiar act playing as if hes part of a private joke that hes not going to share. Once Prots identity is apparently revealed this routine may be seen as Prots protective shield but it feels that hes more aligned with Planet Keyser Soze than anything like a remote star system. Bridges Powell on the other hand is direct face-forward and curious and yet when at home with wife Rachel (Mary McCormack) so wrapped up in work that hes deaf to her. But he is listening to Prot even speculating in front of colleagues about whether the strange man really is from K-PAX. As Prot draws to him such fellow patients as Howie (David Patrick Kelly) whom he assigns to looking out the window for ""the bluebird of happiness"" hes revealed as having the nonhuman ability to detect ultraviolet light (thus his sensitivity to direct light and his perpetual sunglasses) and a huge hunger for produce from bananas to fruit salad. Pic persists in playing the is-he-or-isnt-he game with the viewer reaching its zenith in Softleys most theatrical sequence when Powell brings Prot to a planetarium to meet with some astronomers. Prot displays an ability to mathematically map out K-PAXs location in a way that renders the scientists silent. Prots powers seem to be confirmed when Howie actually spots a bluebird but Powell senses a possible breakthrough when Prot announces that he must depart Earth in three months on July 27 at 551 a.m. -- exactly five years from his arrival. But swinging away from sci-fi the mystery of Prot is less intriguingly turned into a basic psychological study. Sensing hes running against time and fighting his superiors (including the barely visible Alfre Woodard) Powell puts Prot under deep hypnosis and seems to discover a hidden past. Bridges in whats finally a magnificently valiant performance thats much more interesting than Spaceys mannerisms does all he can to make the detective business meaningful -- and make it somehow connect with his own frayed family life -- but it leaves the ultimate sense of a movie that has played at least one game too many with its audience. While the foreground exchanges of Spacey and Bridges contain the dynamic charge of two musicians in concert most of the movies background aspects are laid on with little emotional commitment. Pic ends with a post-credit cookie that has Powell gazing at the stars. In a movie treating light dramatically John Mathiesons lensing makes the screen pulsate with light shadow and spectral color making any glossed-on special effects irrelevant. John Beards production design is at one with Softleys geometrical compositions while Edward Shearmur sounds like hes taken more than a little out of the bag of composer Thomas Newman.

For one thing Prot is logical and his knowledge of the cosmos rivals top boffins; for another he has an uncanny ability to calm and help the institutes other inmates. But could he really be an alien? And if not who is he? Softley and his stars invest this mystery with more respect than it deserves. Since Charles Leavitts adaptation of Gene Brewers book can never decide whether Prots a starman madman or Messiah the film steadily turns into a murky melange of banal explanation far-fetched wish fulfilment and moralistic metaphor. The Oliver Sacks-lite psychiatric seasoning simply sours the brew.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"USATODAY.com - Loopy K-PAX is lost in Spacey Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 10/25/2001 - Updated 0159 PM ET Loopy K-PAX is lost in Spacey By Claudia Puig USA TODAY K-PAX (out of four) Stars Kevin Spacey Jeff Bridges Alfre Woodard Mary McCormack Director Iain Softley Distributor Universal Pictures Rating PG-13 for violent images brief language and sensuality Besides being saddled with the years worst title (conjuring images of a politically correct NPR station or a bioterrorist agent) this misguided movie is shackled by its own overreaching sense of importance and foggy earnestness. Some of the actors acquit themselves notably Jeff Bridges who makes almost any role credible and Alfre Woodard as a skeptical doctor with sadly not enough screen time. As impressive as Kevin Spacey ordinarily is this isnt the best vehicle for his considerable talents. After seminal performances in important films such as American Beauty L.A. Confidential and The Usual Suspects (and in the lesser-seen but no less impressive Swimming With Sharks and The Big Kahuna) this role is a let-down. Read more Video K-PAX trailer Spacey plays Prot an enigmatic mental patient who professes to be from the planet K-PAX. Prot is sometimes elusive and remote sometimes uncommonly kind and compassionate occasionally snide and humorously mordant. No one else excels at caustic sarcasm like Spacey and one aches to see him again in roles calling for that trait. Lately alas he has been drawn to more uplifting and heavy-handed fare such as last years Pay It Forward. K-PAX is in a similar vein a queasy amalgamation of Awakenings One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest and Starman which also starred Bridges. Here Bridges plays psychiatrist Mark Powell whose obsession with divining whether the mild-mannered wacko is delusional or a bona fide extraterrestrial jeopardizes his own family relationships. (Of course as in most message-drenched movies the unbalanced Prot helps the otherwise shrewd Powell to redress his own failures.) Prot is no run-of-the-mill alien from nearby Mars or Venus; he hails from a planet 1000 light-years away. And when he says he plans to return home the other patients in the mental hospital compete to go back with him. If youve seen any other movie set in an asylum you can pretty much predict how things will play out. Prot restores the hope of the profoundly depressed the dignity of the demented and the speech of the catatonic. Ultimately the film posits that it doesnt matter whether Prot is a madman or a more evolved being from outer space Either way he has made a huge impact on the inmates and on Powell. But exactly what he has taught them remains murky. That theres a fine line between sanity and insanity? That science doesnt have all the answers? That bananas are tastiest eaten with the peel still on? One walks out of this film with more questions than answers. But the question that burns longest is ""When will Kevin Spacey go back to doing what he does best?""

When we first meet him he seems almost transparent standing in Grand Central Station in an eerie pool of light. Hes Prot (rhymes with boat) an alien from the planet K-PAX -- or so he says. Like most aliens from faraway planets he ends up in a psychiatric ward where he gets busy bettering the lives of those around him. Spacey whose regular-guy looks are weirdly appropriate here (hes even got a little earth-shaped bald spot) gives a meticulously controlled surprising performance. As Prot hes soft-spoken and formal of speech bobbing his head while talking as if accustomed to different air. Its an amusing shtick although not too different from the kind of deadpan work weve seen from Spacey before. ""K-PAX"" 1/2 With Kevin Spacey Jeff Bridges Alfre Woodard Mary McCormack Peter Gerety. Directed by Iain Softley from a screenplay by Charles Leavitt based on the novel by Gene Brewer. 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sequence of violent images and brief language and sensuality. Several theaters. Preview In the movies final third though in a pivotal hypnosis scene Spacey does something quite uncanny a tiny sad voice emerges from him. Its a voice I hadnt heard from him before -- in this movie or in other movies -- and his characters subsequent emotion is all the more affecting for the stoicism that preceded it. Jeff Bridges as the psychiatrist trying to figure out if Prot is the real deal has a far less showy role but hes also terrific in a laid-back way. (I wondered during Bridges frequent small grins if he was remembering his own turn as a good-guy alien in ""Starman."") This exemplary film acting however is in the service of a screenplay that never quite takes us anywhere new making ""K-PAX"" a frustrating near miss. Charles Leavitts script is all over the place with unnecessary explorations of Dr. Powells family life (did we really need the frustrated wife AND the estranged son?) and a tendency to sentimentalize the psych-ward patients. Some of the dialogue (""Its mass hysteria"" says a doctor when the patients get into a tizzy) is just silly. But director Iain Softley (""The Wings of the Dove"") is a talent to watch guiding his cast through some potentially gooey scenes with a light dry touch. And director of photography John Mathieson (""Gladiator"") infuses ""K-PAX"" with a shadowy beauty. A scene near the end of a man slowly wading into dark water until his head finally submerges is as lovely a shot as any Ive seen this year.

Starring Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges. Directed by Iain Softley. Written by Charles Leavitt. (VHS and DVD. PG-13. 125 minutes.) He arrives in a burst of celestial light emanating cool in dark glasses and 3-day-old beard. ""Ive forgotten"" he tells the cops at Grand Central Station. ""Your planet is really bright."" In ""K-Pax"" Kevin Spacey plays Prot (rhymes with ""note"") an emissary from the planet K-Pax who visits Manhattan on a fact-finding mission. Sent to a psychiatric facility run by the earnest Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) Prot runs mental circles around the hapless shrink. Played by Spacey Prot is no ordinary delusional. A genius at astrophysics he seems imbued with an otherworldly wisdom and serenity. Huge doses of Thorazine dont faze him and Bridges analysis only makes him chuckle. Directed by British filmmaker Iain Softley ""K-Pax"" provides a terrific showcase for Spacey who brings an enchanted almost messianic quality to Prot. People love this guy His fellow patients revere him and a team of astronomers is dumbstruck by his level of knowledge. For at least the first half ""K-Pax"" plays like a lighthearted parable about magic and otherness and the possibility of metaphysical phenomena existing in our mundane lives. That part of the film is totally absorbing. But something happens in ""K- Pax"" in the second half that disrupts that note of fancy and brings the movie down to a hokey psychological level. Theres plenty to appreciate in ""K-Pax."" Softley has a lovely way with actors and has the grace to let scenes play out as long as they need to. Its a shame that the movie devolves into such a paint-by-numbers disappointment. . This movie contains some intense emotional content.

They speak in low measured cadences. Theyre provocatively calm these seemingly mild masked men. But an exciting thrum of craziness vibrates just below their placid surfaces - in the taunting genius of ""The Usual Suspects"" Verbal Kint say or the bland monstrousness of John Doe in ""Seven."" And while every Spacey man guards a secret some psychological subterfuges are more interesting - and more suited to the actors performance style - than others Ill take Lester Burnhams reckless self-loathing suburban bust-up in ""American Beauty"" over Eugene Simonets charred self-pitying fear of intimacy in ""Pay It Forward"" any day. Im not sure what to make of the confounding detachment from other human beings that Spacey personifies in K-PAX a mystical twistical psychological drama in the ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" tradition of romanticizing the miraculous charismatic saintly insane. But something in the planets doesnt align in the spaceman-or-madman conundrum the film poses. Here the actors familiar cragged visage is assigned to a sleepless unshaven maddeningly beatific being who calls himself Prot (rhymes with vote or goat) a stranger who is picked up in New Yorks Grand Central Station at the scene of a mugging. Confined to a public psychiatric hospital by a system that doesnt know what to make of a polite undiagnosable patient who says the light on Earth is far brighter than what hes used to on his distant home planet of ""K-PAX"" Prot becomes the obsession of Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) an established psychiatrist familiar with delusional Jesuses. Prot doesnt fit the profile. He doesnt destabilize even under the heaviest doses of psychotropic drugs and hes got an inexplicably brilliant grasp of astronomy enough to impress top scientists. Stuck in a mental ward with the usual psychiatric suspects - the obsessive-compulsive mouse (David Patrick Kelly) the Miss Havisham-ish old lady (Celia Weston) the germophobe (""Slam"" poet Saul Williams) - none of whom have any problem with the notion that their new neighbor really is an extraterrestrial Prot becomes their leader. Hes their therapist their R.P. McMurphy their freakin king of hearts. He cocks his head in birdlike gestures of curiosity; he traverses the halls of his asylum with childlike steps. He says theres no such thing as family on K-PAX yet he comforts soothes and unites his neighbors. Prot also has a profound effect on Powell who begins to doubt everything he knows about earthlings and aliens - the doctor barely noticing that his own distraction is taking a toll on his wife (Mary McCormack) and children. Is Prot a wounded angel a blessed crazy a mystical emissary a guy in need of medication or a true K-PAXian? Director Iain Softley (who created such Jamesian beauty in ""The Wings of the Dove"") and screenwriter Charles Leavitt (who did what he could with ""The Mighty"") work hard to blur the answers sometimes literally blurring focus. Collaborating with painterly cinematographer John Mathieson (""Gladiator"" ""Hannibal"") Softley lingers on moments of otherworldly beauty and everyday activity on Earth whether its a barbecue in Powells backyard or the rainbow refraction of light through crystal on the doctors desk. Leavitt plays off against the visual gentleness with dialogue of snappish wit ""Dont worry Im not going to leap out of your chest"" Prot reassures Powell. ""Your produce alone has been worth the trip"" he announces at one point ingesting a banana peel and all. (For his part in an undershaped role Bridges reacts by smiling back benignly running his fingers through his fabulous Bridges-boy hair and as he pieces Prots puzzle together while losing track of the pieces of his own life taking a lot of naps.) I rather like the whole mystic- crystal-revelations aspect of ""K-PAX"" and the idea that even a psychiatrist of Jeff Bridges handsome American substantiality is open to notions of cosmic improbability. What bugs me though - aside from my earthbound impatience with dramas that wax romantic about the nobility of insanity as the only sane reaction to a lousy world - is the earthbound path Spacey seems to be taking. First with ""Pay It Forward"" and now with ""K-PAX"" he has chosen to squish his big complex talent into safe-movie containers - into characters who are walking moral lessons not just men (let alone slippery cunning deadly smart men who shouldnt be let out of our sights). There are scenes in ""K-PAX"" when Spacey plays tired and vulnerable and Christlike - often in carefully decorated settings where the humans around him are sharing Kodak moments of togetherness. Thats very E.T. of him but not what we need not even in a Spacey extraterrestrial. What we want from him is a guy who will leap out of our chests while appearing to be the nicest calmest man on the planet.

Its worth noting that this has been a dismal year for movies so far so the standards are quite low. But that said this is a well-executed film that doesnt fit any of Hollywoods tried and true -- and tired -- formulas. It expects an intelligent audience and allows viewers to come to their own conclusions. Spacey stars as Prot a mild-mannered man arrested in Grand Central Station after hes mistakenly thought to be involved in a mugging. When he calmly announces that the light on earth is much brighter than what hes used to on his home planet of K-Pax hes sent to a psychiatrist at a local public hospital.
