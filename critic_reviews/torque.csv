Thats motorbikes as in streamlined pumped-up tarmac-bruisers. The plot? A tissue-thin excuse to burn rubber - something to do with gangs chicks Feds drugs frame-ups true love and Ice Cubes perma-sneer; bring on wet T-shirts at the biker meet the fetishising of machines and a line of 20 designer Hells Angels urinating over a cliff. First time director Kahn lobs in quotations from Duel and lifts two fingers in the direction of The Fast and the Furious but the chase on through and in front of a Trans-Am train isnt believable for a second and the effects in the climactic pursuit have Cheap Video Game written all over them.

Mix of tongue-in-cheeky humor and spectacle may fuel a brief but profitable spin through megaplexes. Its not too fast not too furious -- and for the most part not too stupid. ""Torque"" is a spectacularly trashy and aggressively flashy motorcycle melodrama in which computer-enhanced action scenes unbound by gravity or logic are choreographed photographed and edited to resemble video-game stratagems. Scattered between the set pieces however are pointed suggestions of self-mockery that do much to redeem the frenzied enterprise. Mix of tongue-in-cheeky humor and vroom-and-boom spectacle may fuel a brief but profitable spin through megaplexes followed by high performance on the homevid racetrack. Freshman feature helmer Joseph Kahn yet another music-video veteran who measures shots in nanoseconds sets over-the-top tone in pre-titles sequence as leather-clad biker Cary Ford (Martin Henderson of ""The Ring"") out-races two hot rodders on a California desert highway then pummels the dumb lugs when they foolishly attack our hero outside a roadside diner. Shortly afterward buddies Dalton (Jay Thompson) and Val (Will Yun Lee) join Ford for a hard ride to a motorcycle rally. Along the way however theyre briefly delayed by a nasty encounter with badass Trey Wallace (Ice Cube) his jumpy brother Junior (Fredo Starr) and assorted other members of the Reapers Wallaces outlaw biker gang. Credit Kahn for narrative economy Within the first few minutes he effectively intros all the genres -- Western road movie blaxploitation gang-war story biker melodrama -- ""Torque"" will ransack for cliches and archetypes. Matt Johnsons screenplay is little more than a perfunctory checklist of mandatory plot devices. The storyline such as it is has something to with Shane (Monet Mazur) Fords beautiful mechanic girlfriend and Henry (Matt Schulze) leader of a sleazy bike gang. (Aud knows they are sleazy because their leathers are much dirtier than those worn by Ford or the Reapers.) Six months earlier Henry asked Ford to store two motorcycles in Shanes garage. Unfortunately Ford soon discovered the bikes had crystal meth stored in the gas tanks. So Ford hid the bikes and fled to Thailand in the hope of protecting Shane from possible arrest as a co-conspirator. Now Ford is back wanting to reconnect with his sweetie. But Henry -- who vividly recalls Willem Dafoes wild-eyed bad boy in Walter Hills ""Streets of Fire"" (1984) -- is still around and very determined to retrieve his property. Henry murders Junior and frames Ford hoping that Ford will spill the beans about where he stashed the bikes to avoid certain retribution by an enraged Trey. Soon Ford Dalton Val and Shane are racing through the desert hotly pursued by the Reapers two FBI agents (Adam Scott Justina Machado) and hundreds maybe thousands of state troopers deputy sheriffs and quite possibly National Guard reservists. Neal H. Moritz producer of ""The Fast and the Furious"" and its sequel clearly intends to make lightning strike thrice with this latest high-octane extravaganza. Even so he allows Kahn and Johnson to score a few laughs at the expense of the ""Famp;F"" franchise especially when Ford echoes one of Vin Diesels signature lines (""I live my life a quarter-mile at a time"") and Shane responds ""Thats the dumbest thing I ever heard"" Ice Cube adds to the in-joke quotient by working into the dialogue the unprintable title of a notorious rap song he famously performed with NWA. And the FBI agents amusingly played by Scott and Machado have a very funny moment when theyre forced to take a reality check before a high-speed pursuit. The characters are so thin that they are entirely defined by the actors who play them. Hendersons patchwork performance -- a little Brad Pitt here a lot of Kurt Russell there -- just barely generates a rooting interest in Ford. Ice Cube muscles his way through the action on automatic pilot letting his surly glare do most of the acting for him while Mazur relies on a sexy smile and some lithesome body language. Standout among the supporting players is Jaime Pressly if only because shes so ineffably stunning as a body-pierced goth-punk biker chick. Stunt work and special effects are intended as the main attractions in ""Torque"" but even the more attention-grabbing scenes are too obviously faked to build suspense and too confusingly cut to sustain continuity. Late in the action Ford boards a super-duper motorcycle -- specifically a limited-edition state-of-the-art dream machine known as Y2K -- and roars along at a blurry speed usually achieved only by time travelers in sci-fi thrillers. Here and elsewhere however the on-screen imagery is a good deal less persuasive than visuals available on a Play Station 2.

Scruffy guys ride what one character calls ""crotch rockets"" and the movies thoroughly uninteresting blob of a villainess (Jaime Pressly) has a pierced nose and pierced lips to go with the holes in her brain. (Related item See a clip from Torque) Ice Cube shoots a little stink-eye at his competition in Torque. Warner Bros. Torque is also in the grand tradition of third-rate movies that have spent some pre-release time on the shelf -- a reaction perhaps to last years already forgotten Biker Boyz and 2 Fast 2 Furious. The script here is irredeemably 2 fetid and 2 foolish though director Joseph Kahn does dress it up with fast-cuts dazzling cycle stunts and attempts at disarming humor -- or are we giving him too much credit? You can just hear Kurt Russell say ""Boy am I glad I dont have to make movies like this anymore"" when he watches halfway look-alike Martin Henderson be accused of killing the brother of cycle rival Ice Cube. Henderson is also in hot water with his merchant girlfriend (Monet Mazur) for having skipped town and left two bikes he was asked to watch near her shop. The feds didnt like it that they turned out to have crystal meth in their gas tanks nor did she. Now Henderson is forced to plead legitimate innocence to Mazur in a big reconciliation scene. Question Is it that director Kahn doesnt care if we take the apology seriously? Or is he going for a subtly subversive laugh during Hendersons self-defense when he puts the actor in a Ramones T-shirt? About the show Torque  (out of four) Stars Martin Henderson Ice Cube Monet Mazur Matt Schulze Jaime Pressley Director Joseph Kahn Distributor Warner Bros. Rating PG-13 for violence sexuality language and drug references Opens nationwide Friday The cycle thrills here are everything flips collisions a chase across the top of a fast-moving train and even a zoom down the aisle of one of the trains cars as the passengers take it in stride. Torque is apparently set in California though it mostly goes for that undefined otherworldly geographical milieu identified with the Mad Max movies that everyone involved seems to have seen too many times. During the myriad scenes in which the cast seems to be perpetrating crotch-rocket mayhem just for the sport of it you keep hoping that Gov. Schwarzenegger will show up. Not to kick their behinds which of course he could but to tax them for fuel consumption.

(AP Photo/Walt Disney Pictures) FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Torque Action drama. Directed by Joseph Kahn. Written by Matt Johnson. With Martin Henderson Ice Cube Monet Mazur Matt Schulze. (Rated PG-13. 81 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Torque Its only January but already we have a strong candidate for the most thunderingly stupid movie of the year. ""Torque"" is a motorcycle picture like one of those old Jack Nicholson grungy-biker flicks but retooled for the MTV generation. (The director Joseph Kahn is a music video veteran.) There are races fights explosions knuckleheaded cops rival gangs and more dumb motorcycle stunts than in the last ""Charlies Angels"" picture. Instead of the old-style choppers with their high-rise handlebars the focus here is on ultra-fast ultra-expensive high-style ""super bikes"" made by the likes of Honda and Triumph. These vehicles are hell on wheels costing 25 000 and up and capable of hitting 100 mph in less than seven seconds. Everyone needs a hobby. And instead of greasy denim jackets and jeans the characters sport (according to the production notes) ""some of the hippest leatherwear ever seen on screen"" fancy duds that are color-coordinated with their machines. Theres also a gang of black riders who add hip-hop elements to the more traditional biker gear. Hence the movie also functions as a fashion show of sorts. The plots a cross between the ""you stole my drugs"" and ""you killed my brother"" strands familiar from low-end action pictures. The hero a motorcycle enthusiast named Ford (Martin Henderson from ""The Ring"") has just returned to Southern California from Thailand where he fled after coming into possession of methamphetamine belonging to the leader of a drug-dealing bike gang (Matt Schulze looking like Brad Pitt in a mullet). Hes come back he explains to his angry ex-girlfriend (Monet Mazur) a tough chick who runs a motorcycle shop to straighten matters out. But not before hes set up for the murder of the nitwit brother of Trey (Ice Cube) head of the Reapers gang. And a couple of FBI agents who drive a snazzy black Hummer -- straight out of the agencys vehicle pool Im sure -- are also looking for Ford. OK the movies about motorcyclists driving too fast in the desert then fighting then doing it all over again in Los Angeles with occasional fiery crashes and brainless verbal confrontations and one-liners. A couple of bits though ought to appeal to connoisseurs of this stuff one is a zany sequence in which Henderson and Cube wind up chasing each other on their motorcycles atop a moving train; the other a high-octane combat scene conducted at some fantastically high speed no doubt enhanced in the editing room between the two bike-riding female characters. Its not only boys who love their toys. The script contains a few hints that the producers arent taking it all too seriously but in the end junk is junk. In one respect however ""Torque"" is absolutely tops the running time is 81 minutes. Other filmmakers please take note. -- Advisory Strong language and sexual and drug references. Teachers Pet Animated movie. Starring Nathan Lane Kelsey Grammer Jerry Stiller and Paul Reubens. Directed by Timothy Bjorklund. (PG. 75 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Teachers Pet It seems like a bizarre move for Disney releasing a film that combines elements of ""Blues Clues"" and ""The Island of Dr. Moreau."" The result is nowhere near disastrous but after ""Teachers Pet"" is over the colorful tale of a dog who seeks a trans-species operation and considers seducing his owners mother may seem more delightful to marijuana smokers than moviegoing children. ""Teachers Pet"" follows the adventures of a blue canine named Spot (voiced by Nathan Lane) who goes to school posing as a boy named Scott. When Spots young owner (Shaun Flemming) leaves him behind on a road trip to Florida the dog decides to volunteer for a mad scientist (Kelsey Grammer) who claims he can turn animals into people. Adding to the weirdness are a talking bird and cat a Jerry Springer clone and a half-man half-alligator voiced by Paul Reubens. ""Teachers Pet"" the TV show may have worked for kids in 10-minute segments on Saturday morning (the series has won several Daytime Emmys) but after the animation feast that was ""Finding Nemo"" the picture quality in ""Teachers Pet"" the feature film is seriously lacking in splendor. The movie instead relies on its creativity throwing in abstract imagery and stoney visual tangents for the ""Fantasia"" crowd. The 11 songs in ""Teachers Pet"" tend to sound alike. But theyre the highlights of the movie because of the accompanying animation onslaught by art director/co-creator Gary Baseman and director Timothy Bjorklund -- who are comfortable choreographing everything from singing cockroaches to ""Pinocchio"" satire. Spots journey is centered on the most tired moral theme in childrens movies (Just Be Yourself) but the blink-and-youll-miss-them kinetic images make ""Teachers Pet"" seem inventive. This might have been a better movie with the sound off. Unfortunately the sound never stops and the scattered and often subversive plot of ""Teachers Pet"" will make it difficult for some children to watch and too boring for others. Spots obsession to become Scott becomes a little disturbing and the movie -- even at a streamlined 75 minutes -- doesnt have enough jokes that hit the mark. The casting has its share of misses as well. Jay Thomas is more cliche than funny as an angry talk show host. ""Teachers Pet"" plays like an extended short from ""Spike and Mikes Festival of Animation"" and its the kind of film that serious fans of traditional animation will savor. But originality aside parents expecting a mainstream film may want to wait until another Disney cartoon featuring happy woodland creatures comes along. -- Advisory Mild violence and cartoonish mutated animals. Tokyo Godfathers Animation. Directed by Satoshi Kon. Written by Keiko Nobumoto. (PG-13. 91 minutes. In Japanese with English subtitles. At the Lumiere and Act theaters in Berkeley). Tokyo shimmers in ""Tokyo Godfathers"" a gorgeous animated film thats as avid a tribute to the Japanese capital as ""Lost in Translation."" Director Satoshi Kon (""Millennium Actress"") and his team of animators capture and enhance the nighttime sky creating a metropolis of little traffic and endless possibilities. The pictures visual luster is matched by its moving depiction of its main characters three homeless people who discover an abandoned baby on Christmas Day. Their resulting odyssey carries more than a few biblical implications; the pictures compassion for the downtrodden echoes that of the original Christmas newborn. Led by over-the-hill drag queen Hana (drawn as a cross between Gloria Swanson and Bela Legosi) the three trudge through snow seeking the foundlings parents. Along the way they bond to the infant in much the way they have to each other as a precious lifeline. The picture is hopeful but not overly sentimental with the flaws of the newborns guardian angels well in evidence. Hana is an emotional wreck prone to lashing out at those closest to him. His companions are a sometimes belligerent drunk and a teenage runaway so flinty she bristles at the kindness of her protectors. Energized by the search for the infants parents the three do things they didnt think they could like jumping off a moving train and tangling with mobsters. Director Kon and screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto balance these adventures with the sad reality of life on the streets where passers-by are indifferent at best. In one disturbing scene several teenage boys beat the alcoholic man mercilessly one chatting on his cell phone all the while. ""Tokyo Godfathers"" is most concerned with interior demons however and how the gift of the foundling will affect the trios lives. As such its an unusual animated film. More character study than action movie ""Tokyo Godfathers"" could just as well have been a live-action picture. But one look at its jaw-dropping cityscapes makes you glad its not. -- Advisory This film contains violence raw language.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr B Torque Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Dane Cook Martin Henderson Jay Hernandez Ice Cube Faizon Love Monet Mazur Christina Milian Jaime Pressly; Director Joseph Kahn; Author Matt Johnson; Release Date Wide 01/16/2004; Runtime (in minutes) 81; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted January 15 2004 -- 1200 AM EST Torque is the dietary opposite of a no-carb diet. Its all carb no protein - and like its cousins in the ""Fast and the Furious"" family this action-heavy content-light baby is all carburetors too as well as wheels dudes and pouting chicks. Only this time the adrenaline is based on a theme of motorcycles and the boys and girls who love to straddle them (and afterward presumably each other). There is absolutely no nutritional value to the parade of races stunts smackdowns brawls jiggles and snug leatherware assembled by director Joseph Kahn - a music-video guy who never met a side-view mirror shot he didnt love - under the maize-colored sun of Southern California; there is only movement tableau character types and splashes of bright borrowed ssssstyle. The movie is a guzzle of yahoo-Mountain Dew empty-calorie satisfaction A quick blood-sugar high an eyeful of bikes and bosoms and youre out of the theater in 80 minutes. And on a bleak winters day that can be meal enough. ""Torque"" can be useful too as a kind of checklist on the state-of-art-direction trends to peruse when not riveted by the cartoon violence of young folks who want to drive fast split one anothers heads open then drive fast some more. Certainly the desert highway of a plot leaves plenty of time for admiring the cool ethnic mix of the players and the way every character is introduced from the feet up. (The never-gets-out-of-first-gear screenplay is by Matt Johnson.) ""The Ring""s Martin Henderson stars as Ford easy-rider biker hero who expounds his philosophy by a roadside diner ""What is it about driving cars that makes you all such a-holes?"" he queries a couple of goons before clobbering them. The New Zealand-born Henderson who has an unnerving way of looking like any Cruise-Pitt-McConaughey-handsome actor you want him to depending on how he hitches a hip behaves more like a cocky surfer than a racer Fords back from Thailand (travel note Thailand is in) to reconnect with his biker girlfriend (Monet Mazur) who as a bonus is named Shane - you were expecting maybe she would be named Rivka? Ford also needs to settle a score with one drug-dealing biker-gang leader (mulleted Matt Schulze) while keeping a rival gang heavy (Ice Cube snarling so hard that his lip quivers) out of his face and dodging a cowboy FBI agent (""High Crimes"" Adam Scott). As someone - biker? rapper? supermodel? bachelorette? - would say its all good. Dumb and good the way a motorcycle chase across the top of a speeding train is dumb and good. ""Torque"" the latest hot-shot gear-stripping machine from the shop of producer Neal H. Moritz recovers the junk-purity of ""The Fast and the Furious"" and overcomes the primping and prettying of the ""Fast/Furious"" sequel. Its as shiny and showy as a Triumph TT 600 which can attain a maximum power of 110PS at 12750 rpm and a maximum torque of 68Nm at 11000 rpm. Which Im told is something.
