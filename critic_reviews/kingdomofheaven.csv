Who Needs Em? By David Ansen On 5/12/05 at 800 PM NewsThe big summer movie season was supposed to begin with the fireworks of Ridley Scotts ""Kingdom of Heaven"" but the big bang turned out to be more of a whimper. An augury of things to come or just a bump in Hollywoods triumphant road? The studios are nervously awaiting the answer because movie attendance has been slumping week after week. And why shouldnt it when Hollywood deliberately sticks to its dogs-only policy for the first three or four months of the year? Do they think moviegoers dont notice?But why should every movie have to be a blockbuster? As George Lucass Death Star approaches lets pause a moment and take a quick gander at some of the other offerings out there from the mainstream appeal of ""Kicking amp; Screaming"" to the out-of-left-field delights of ""Mad Hot Ballroom."" Its hard to remember but there was once a time when there was no such thing as ""a summer movie."" There were just movies that came out in summer like any other.Kingdom of Heaven Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week Borrowing heavily from his own ""Gladiator"" Ridley Scott follows another grief-stricken hero (Orlando Blooms Balian) a 12th-century blacksmith turned knight from France who wends his way to Jerusalem during a lull in the Crusades and turns into a charismatic leader. Scotts pacifist cant-we-all-get-along take on the Crusades avoids demonizing either Muslims or Christians (the bad guys are the warmongering military sect the Knights Templar) but it also fails to rouse any passion. A potentially great subject is frittered away though this being a Scott movie theres style to spare. Jeremy Irons and an exuberantly nasty Brendan Gleeson do their best to liven things up but the miscasting of the lightweight Bloom proves fatal instead of galvanizing this epic he sucks the energy out of it.CrashPaul Haggiss first film as a director (he wrote the fine adaptation of ""Million Dollar Baby"") is an ambitious intense but overdetermined exploration of the varieties of ethnic intolerance. Structured like a ronde it offers supercharged vignettes from a day in the life of racially fraught Los Angeles. There are many scenes especially in the first half that have you holding your breath Matt Dillon as a racist cop pulls over TV director Terence Howard and his stylish wife Thandie Newton for trumped up reasons and humiliates them while his outraged partner (Ryan Phillippe) looks on helplessly. Later well see that even racists have their noble side and even good guys have their hidden prejudices. This is a keen complex observation until you notice that Haggis is determined to apply the same paradox to every one of his characters (except Michael Penas saintly Latino handyman).Haggis has a fine cast including Don Cheadle as a haunted police detective Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges as a speechifying carjacker whos always decrying white peoples stereotypes of black men and Sandra Bullock as the hysterical insufferably bigoted wife of Brendan Frasers D.A. They create compelling characters whose behavior becomes increasingly hard to believe as theyre forced to jump through Haggiss pre-ordained thematic hoops.Haggis shows a lot of promise as a director his film is never dull. But he needs to unlearn some of the bad lessons he picked up working in TV which demands that everything be neat symmetrical and underlined. In ""Crash"" everybody expresses their ugliest prejudices openly and at the drop of a hat. But isnt the whole point of big-city racism that its largely covert?Mad Hot BallroomA much more sanguine view of cultural diversity emerges in this enchanting documentary directed by Marilyn Agrelo which follows aspiring 11-year-old competitive dancers in three New York city schools in Bensonhurst (Italian and Asian) Tribeca (a hip mix) and the mostly Dominican P.S. 115 in Washington Heights. Watching the transformation of these kids as they achieve mastery over the tango rumba foxtrot and swing is sweet indeed though I wish Agrelo had been able to go deeper into their home lives. ""Spellbound"" to which it will be inevitably compared cast a broader sociological net.But what ""Mad Hot Ballroom"" lacks in depth it more than makesup for in charm and vibrancy. And a couple of these kids have preternatural star power young Wilson Castillo a Dominican immigrant who speaks very little English burns up the dance floor with slow suave fire. Can you resist this movie? Dont even try.Kicking amp; ScreamingDoes it seem as if Will Ferrell is in every other movie coming out these days? Im not complaining if they are all as amusing as this one. Ferrell stars as a vitamin salesman whos forced to coach his sons soccer team a last-place band of misfits. Uh oh you think havent we seen this one before? Yes and no. Before director Jesse Dylans comedy (written by Leo Benvenuti and Steve Rudnick) arrives at its preordained (and mechanical) heartwarming conclusion it veers off in some unexpected and interesting directions. With Robert Duvall playing Ferrells insufferably competitive dad its more like a farcical version of ""The Great Santini"" than ""The Bad News Bears"" redux. Ferrell who develops a hilarious addiction to massive infusions of coffee morphs from victim-son to monster-coach as his rabid will to win transforms him into a mirror image of the father he hates.Its all kept light and funny but underlying the broad sight gags is a movie that actually has something to say about competition fathers and sons machismo and caffeine. Mike Ditka appears as Mike Ditka and plays himself very well. ""Kicking amp; Screaming"" is the Hollywood summers first pleasant surprise.BrothersOne brother Michael (Ulrich Thomsen) is a rock an upstanding soldier and family man who is sent to Afghanistan to serve with the U.N. peacekeepers. The other Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) is the black sheep just released from prison alcoholic he shows every sign of falling back into his bad old ways. But when he hears that Michael has been killed while on duty abroad hes freed from his old role as the bad apple and a transformation begins as he tries to comfort Michaels wife (Connie Nielson) and kids. Michael however isnt dead. But he isnt the same either what he must do to survive as a prisoner of the Taliban will change him even more dramatically than Jannik.Danish filmmaker Susanne Biers unsettling psychologically astute film is about many things the nature of sibling rivalry the effect of wartime violence on civilian life the things we can and cant forgive ourselves. But its as much about the wife/widow whose life is turned upside down as it is about the two brothers and Nielson shows a depth and emotional transparency shes not been allowed in English-language films. Taut and unexpected ""Brothers"" is gripping from start to finish.Mysterious SkinGregg Araki one of the bright lights of what was once known as the New Queer Cinema (""The Living End"" ""The Doom Generation"") is still fascinated with young beautiful self-destructive kids. But in this adaptation of a Scott Heim novel (the first adaptation Araki has ever done) a whole new tone and style emerge. The former enfant terrible has grown up. Hes still dealing with rough subjects--child molestation gay hustling rebellious kids--but not for their shock value.This time he abandons his trademark Cool and dives into deep and twisted emotional waters telling the parallel stories of two Kansas boys (beautifully played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Brady Corbet). Both were violated as 8-year-olds but deal with the aftermath of this traumatic event in totally different ways one becoming a chilly guarded but charismatic prostitute and the other almost pathologically shy becoming increasingly obsessed with UFOs he thinks he was abducted by aliens during those pivotal traumatic hours he cant remember. (Chase Ellison and George Webster play the boys at age 8.)""Mysterious Skin"" explores both prepubescent and teen sexuality with an honesty that may make some people uncomfortable which is a sign of its potency and a badge of honor. Bill Sage plays the baseball coach obsessed with little boys and avoids all stereotypes. His acts are as unforgivable as his humanity is inescapable. The movie sugarcoats nothing but it doesnt revel in its own darkness either. It sheds a clear compassionate illuminating light.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

By 1186 Jerusalem is still held by the Christians though only as part of a working truce with the powerful Muslim leader Saladin that offers religious tolerance within the city. Unfortunately enlightened Christian ruler Baldwin IV the so-called leper king is in decaying health with no successor. With a tussle for control looming its time for Orlando Blooms knight Balian to make his mark as the former blacksmith arrives in the city to assume control of his Crusader knight fathers lands and find his spiritual purpose in the Kingdom of Heaven.Enshrining the fruitfulness of compromise and establishing a mans worth through his actions rather than adherence to clerical prescripts Balians quest for conflict resolution brings much respect for wise Saladin (charismatic Syrian Ghassan Massoud) with the villains of the piece clearly the holy-war-mongering Christian fundamentalist Knights Templar (Brendan Gleeson and Marton Csokas who seriously over-eggs it). If the contemporary angle is obvious and presumably not what Bushs America wants to hear its also perhaps just a touch too impeccably liberal to convince in its proper historical context though never less than absorbing. Cramped for space at 144 minutes reducing love interest Eva Greens Princess Sibylla to an exotic bystander the films storytelling is often awkward but it offers quality mayhem with its slashing spouting battle scenes and copious boiling oil. Overall its striking in thought and deed and you will honestly believe they rebuilt twelfth-century Jerusalem for the occasion.

"Scotts Kingdom Heaven Help Us washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Scotts Kingdom Heaven Help Us Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom) must defend Jerusalem in Ridley Scotts crusades epic ""Kingdom of Heaven."" (Twentieth Century Fox) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Thomson Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 6 2005 WE KNOW were supposed to be watching ""Kingdom of Heaven"" Ridley Scotts epic about the battle of wills between Balian of Ibelin (Orlando Bloom) a 12th-century French crusader charged with protecting Jerusalem and Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) the Muslim leader whose multitudinous army stands in force outside the holy city. But as Balian and his people withstand the might of Saladins fiery projectiles siege towers and the usual computer-generated swarm of soldiers its hard not to think were really watching ""The Lord of the Rings IV Legolas Defends Jerusalem."" Epics have rapidly become digitalized live-action cartoons for the pre-parental and theres little sign of abatement so long as audiences remain resolutely young and determined to watch heroes their own age playing grown-up warriors. Heroes used to be greater and more imposing than the audience. Nowadays theyre slightly exaggerated versions of the dudes and dudettes watching in the audience. Even though director Scott and screenwriter William Monahan have assembled a thoughtful (if flawed) antiwar scenario about the religious divisions that pit one great people against another they still have to reduce it to a mere backdrop for a boy toy with good hair and excellent backlighting. Blooms Balian is a blacksmith in France who learns hes the illegitimate son of crusader knight Godfrey (Liam Neeson these days a regular paternal figure in epics) whose chivalrous reputation is well known in the Holy Land. Monahan and Scott sure ratchet up Balians motivation to go His wife just committed suicide which means she will remain in hell unless he redeems himself somewhere. Oh yeah and he just killed and burned a man who taunted him about all this. When local forces come to apprehend Balian for murder well he has yet another reason to get the heck out of La Dodge. He takes a 65-second sword-training session from his father and a really big German warrior and hes ready to get medieval. Balian gets to the Holy Land and that one-minute tutorial turns out to have been useful. He is forced to slay a belligerent Muslim warrior but he shows mercy to the warriors companion all of which reaches Saladin whose own sense of chivalry is legendary. When Balian gets to Jerusalem he finds a city in which Christians Muslims and Jews live side by side in nonaggressive harmony. Saladin shows no sign of invasion as long as everyone lives this peaceably. But there are bad forces within these walls namely a group of Knights Templar under the charge of Reynald (Brendan Gleeson) and dastardly Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas another ""Lord of the Rings"" grad; he was Celeborn). Predictably they mess up a beautiful thing and Saladin is ready to take Jerusalem. Guy is married to Jerusalems schwingy queen Sibylla (Eva Green) who makes eyes at Balian three seconds after he struts in. Now theres a Brad-meets-Angelina imbroglio waiting to happen but Balian has a city to defend first. A dude has to work up a battlefield sweat then dither morally about hitting on royalty. Blooms presence in the movie is a red-carpet affair. Seasoned actors (including Jeremy Irons and David Thewlis) project appropriate deference as he parts crowds and wows extras. But the real star is Saladin an Islamic hero of deep integrity. In the role Massoud (a Syrian actor well known in the Middle East) is masterful and booms with the gravitas in short supply on the Christian side. To introduce an archetype like this to western audiences -- as the world weathers culturally and religiously demonizing times -- may have been worth this whole flawed movie. Too bad the story didnt just start with him. KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (R 138 minutes) -- Contains graphic battle violence. Area theaters.

"At the Gates of Hell washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On At the Gates of Hell Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday May 6 2005 ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is full of astonishments not the least of which are its ideas. You may or may not agree with them and you may or may not agree with the uses to which the director Ridley Scott puts the historical record in order to advance them. Regardless the movie is built around an intellectual structure as much as a dramatic one. Set in the 12th century just before the Third Crusade as Christian knights had established a mini-Camelot in and around Jerusalem the movie fully deploys the splendors and the savageries of its age including the beauty of armored men on magnificent steeds under rippling pennants and the carnage that they are capable of unleashing upon each other. But these are simply elements in the philosophical calculus a screen to mask its true direction. It decodes into something quite familiar zealots vs. cosmopolitans. In the liberal view this would be conservatives vs. liberals. In the conservative view this would be warriors vs. wimps. In Washington neocons vs. cons. In any event on both sides the fanatics push toward extreme solutions and the moderates urge restraint and negotiation. The movie apotheosizes at its end an act not of heroism but of surrender One general puts himself and his men in the care of the other general confident in the knowledge that both are men of honor and more important men of the sane middle ground and that both can survive with dignity and responsibilities intact. A pipe dream of possibility in the Middle East? Perhaps and Scott has to do a lot of jury-rigging of actuality in order to bring it off. But in Scotts retelling its the moderate elements of both Muslim and Christian societies that just want to get along and the true battle they face is against the extremists in either camp who want not only war but slaughter in its aftermath. In other words the boys from Massacres-R-Us vs. the boys from We-R-the-World. We open with the French blacksmith Balian (Orlando Bloom) mourning for his wife who killed herself after their child died. Balians long-lost father arrives and its none other than Sir Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson) a salty crusader up from his duchy in the Holy Land to regain the out-of-wedlock son hed abandoned years before. Balian rejects the older mans entreaty but when a priest mocks him for loving a wife who as a suicide was not permitted into Heaven and now resides in Hell Balian sends that fellow to Hell as well by piercing his breast and dousing him in flame. Stricken with guilt he realizes that the only place where he can achieve Gods forgiveness is the Holy Land so he hastens to join his father. There truly was a Balian but he was no blacksmith. He was simply another highborn knight in the Holy Land which was the only home he ever knew. Whats the point of the change? Possibly Scott meant to show that by his loss his grief and his ordeal was his Balian open to compromise and change from a strict crusaders commitment to slaughtering infidels -- even as the infidels were slaughtering them back under the impression they were the ones slaughtering infidels. But this doesnt quite work. Instead the plot argues a reactionary theory that Scott might not even be aware of the natural superiority of the hereditary aristocrat particularly as Balian who has styled himself a blue-collar working guy rises almost effortlessly by dint of his inherited talents and soon is not only a knight himself but a wise battlefield commander. (Balians rise might not have seemed so easy and quick had the movie been released in its intended 3-hour 40-minute format instead of this streamlined 2-hour 20-minute variant.) Anyhow the wise and generous Godfrey is soon disposed of (in a brilliantly choreographed small unit action) and Balian now arrived in Jerusalem finds himself in the hothouse of crusader politics backroom-style. In Jerusalem the leper king Baldwin (Edward Norton behind a silver mask) and his wise counselor Tiberias (Jeremy Irons as a kind of Colin Powell of 1194) yearn for peace and work hard to negotiate with the Muslims their grandfathers so bloodily drove out of Jerusalem some 80 years earlier. Meanwhile the great Muslim leader Saladin (Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud) battles his own bloodthirsty minions to keep a fragile peace with the blue-eyed outlanders. But most of the politics is on the crusader side The knights Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Reynald (a red-bearded Brendan Gleeson) pine for war and the pleasures of genocide. In a power ploy meant to hasten the demise of King Baldwins power and advance Guys they begin a secret terror campaign and soon enough despite the importunings of heroic moderates the war is inevitable. If you know your history you know that the war was an exceedingly bad idea. Guy and Reynald led the knights and squires and men at arms into the desert and at a place called Hattin managed to get themselves wiped out. Reynald was executed by Saladin himself a scene that Scott creates as the application of justice. Then it was onward to Jerusalem which was at this time commanded by Our Hero Balian. Two questions Is Orlando Bloom enough of a star to sustain a 100 million costume drama? The answer turns out to be yes. A pretty face as Paris in ""Troy"" and a blond nonentity as the arrow-flinger in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy he is able to dominate the second half of this film in the old-fashioned movie-star way. Scott is smart enough to dirty the young mans face and let his beard blur the freak perfection of his features which gives this Balian a more masculine more commanding presence. Bloom fights his own fights and reveals an athletes quick grace and strength with the broadsword so that as a warrior hes convincing. As a thinker and diplomat hes also impressive. As a late-borning humanitarian idealist he will break your heart even if you despise his and the movies politics. Second is the issue of war. This is Scotts specialty (""Gladiator"" ""Black Hawk Down"") and as a technician of movie battle hes probably the worlds best. Using the full range of film trickery -- the CGI is especially compelling in its ability to re-create medieval panoramas and endless fields of troops -- he really puts you in the thick of mortal danger. The early fights are mostly on horseback and Scott loves horses and is able to get so much of these grand sinewy weapons of destruction their muscles bulging their ligaments straining their nostrils spouting steam. You feel like youve been deposited into the center of a Howard Pyle illustration. But its the siege where Scott shines. He tracks the huge war machines that were the heavy artillery of the pre-gunpowder age gizmos that flung boulders like 155mm shells. But most of all he gets the labor of war This was heavy lifting of the heaviest sort and the physical ordeal and the terrible nature of the blade- and spearpoint-induced wounds gets full frightening display. Adore the films politics or abjure them you must respect Scott for refusing to settle for empty spectacle. And the spectacle besides being idea-jammed is spectacular. Kingdom of Heaven (138 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for extreme violence.

Starring Orlando Bloom Eva Green and Liam Neeson.Directed by Ridley Scott. (R. 144 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) To make a successful Hollywood film about the Crusades a big obstacle has to be overcome. To put it bluntly The West was wrong and the West lost and yet this is not the era in which to expect Western audiences to embrace the sight of Muslim armies chopping up Christian invaders. Nor does the opposite sight hold any appeal. The subject is seemingly too fraught and too close to home and yet its precisely out of that tension that screenwriter William Monahan has fashioned an intelligent and highly topical epic. Director Ridley Scott has brought it home with banners flying. To say that Scott did a beautiful job directing ""Kingdom of Heaven"" would be true but it wouldnt convey the nature of the achievement. A better way to say it is that Scott in the course of planning and making this huge film made many thousands of decisions little and big and just about all of them turned out right. The scenes of spectacle provide the most flamboyant evidence of the directors sureness and imagination but theyre also evident in the acting moments and in unexpected casting choices such as that of the young and ultra-modern Eva Green (""The Dreamers"") as a medieval princess. Unlike Oliver Stones ""Alexander"" which tried to enlist the audience on Alexanders side by sweeping moral considerations under the rug ""Kingdom of Heaven"" embraces moral complexity. The Christian invaders fight for God and for greed. Some are motivated by faith and some are just murderous. Balian (Orlando Bloom) the bastard son a knight finds himself confronted with uncomfortable decisions in which there are no clear-cut moral choices. Death is the consequence of every course of action. The movies one consistent point of view is that rationality is to be favored over fanaticism. ""To kill an infidel is not murder its the path to heaven"" a priest says as he greets warriors wholl soon embark for the Middle East. Its the movies reminder that pious bloodlust is a disease that strikes all sides. They say the door of opportunity opens once for everybody. For Balian it arrives in the form of an aging knight (Liam Neeson) passing through on the way back to his estate near Jerusalem. Balian a blacksmith looks all set to sweat away the rest of his days banging with a hammer on a molten sword. (Is that all they ever made in those days?) But the knight identifies himself as Balians long-lost dad and offers to take him to Jerusalem. After a brief delay for decision-making in which Balian commits a needless murder he joins Dads group which includes a wise and twinkly parson (David Thewlis). For Balian Jerusalem is an opportunity to remake his life to be accepted on his merits and live like a prince. Jerusalem is presented as a singular outpost on the edge of the world rather like the French settlement in ""Apocalypse Now Redux."" The Europeans have imported their customs and yet the whole thing feels makeshift and temporary and with this temporary sense comes a loose attitude such as one might find in a border town. Balian who has a guilty conscience feels outside of Gods grace which ironically is the key factor in his emergence as a decent man. He aligns himself with Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) and the very reasonable but leprosy- ravaged King (Edward Norton) who both want to co-exist with the Arabs. The other faction is represented by a mentally unbalanced lord (Brendan Gleeson) and Guy de Lusignan the Kings brother-in-law and presumed heir (Marton Csokas). Though surrounded on all sides by Arab armies these two want to attack and slaughter them. Attuned to all shifts in power they combine a realpolitik unscrupulousness with an utterly delusional faith that God will aid them no matter what murderous course they undertake. That would seem to be an unlikely combination of traits except that their type has never ceased turning up in history. The relaxed morals of the Christian outpost make it possible for the blacksmith to soon have carnal knowledge of the politically savvy princess a case of upward social mobility unheard of in 1186 -- the American dream realized a full 600 years before there even was such a thing. At first Green looks young for the role but no shes just right Royalty must grow up and get wise fast. And she does seem wise watchful and pragmatic. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is long and sometimes seems long. That and the fact that occasionally its difficult to tell whos fighting whom are about the worst things that can be said for it. Fortunately all confusion is eliminated for the final sequence a siege by the Islamic general Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) of Jerusalems walls. The siege which goes on for days is presented in meticulous and absorbing detail and one comes away from the film with a pretty advanced understanding of medieval military maneuvering. The sky fills with arrows catapults send fiery rocks crashing into the battlements and the attacking army struggles to place platforms within range from which soldiers might scale the walls. The movie shows that the strategies were sophisticated even if the means were primitive. -- Advisory Sexual situations graphic violence and armies getting medieval on each other.

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post From medieval weaponry to the fortress walls of Jerusalem ""Kingdom of Heaven"" is rich with historical detail. But in Ridley Scotts tale of a young Frenchman who travels to the Holy Land seeking personal and spiritual redemption God doesnt reside in the details. God is everywhere on the tongues of a group of rebellious Knights Templar who shout ""God wills it"" like soccer hooligans before they attack; chanted in morning prayer by Muslims in a land where a brief moment of detente between Christians and Muslims exists. The divine fires the crusaders missions but it also feeds the benevolent rule of Jerusalems King Baldwin IV. (Afflicted with leprosy the young monarch played by Edward Norton hides his face behind a silver mask.) And Allahs presence finds expression in the battlefield ethics of Muslim ruler Saladin (Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud). Between the Second and Third Crusades these two leaders maintained some semblance of peace. It is difficult to celebrate movies about war when the nation is at war. And ""Kingdom of Heaven"" appeared doubly vulnerable to a case of bad timing. After all ""Gladiator"" director Scotts return to the historical epic depicts the clash between competing monotheistic tribes in a region where theyre still going at it. Fortunately William Monahans script and Scotts gift with characters maintains a smart debate about warfare and peace organized religion and an individuals relationship to God and conscience. ""Kingdom of Heaven"" offers a number of moments for reflection even as it delivers them the old-fashioned way with an ordinary soul in the midst of transformation. When ""Kingdom of Heaven"" begins the young wife of a village blacksmith has taken her life. Her widower Balian (Orlando Bloom) simmers. Into the midst of Balians crisis of faith arrives Godfrey of Ibelin. Liam Neeson plays the crusading knight whose long-ago actions have him seeking his illegitimate sons forgiveness. In an effort to make amends Godfrey invites Balian to his land outside Jerusalem. Balian enters the Crusades not to honor his fathers wishes - that comes later - but as a form of atonement. In 1095 Pope Urban II gave the Crusades their rallying cry when he called for Europes Christians to reclaim Jerusalem from the Muslims. If the people already inhabiting those lands should suffer so be it. ""To kill an infidel is not murder"" proselytizes one Christian on the road traveled by knights. ""Its a path to heaven."" Balians journey from France to Jerusalem is the stuff of extreme makeover the hero edition. A lethal ambush presages his ascent to knighthood. Before he takes ownership of his fathers land the ship he sails in will run aground he will duel with a Muslim and he will fall for Sibylla (Eva Green) sister of King Baldwin and wife of the chief warmonger in the kings court Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas). Bloom is no Russell Crowe and ""Kingdom"" shakes the ghost of ""Gladiator"" only after it leaves Europe. But then Balian doesnt have to be as muscular a presence as Maximus. Blooms features still in transit from boy to adult make him a fine if not quite thrilling fit for a character on the cusp of becoming his own man. Bold as many of the battle sequences are - Balians defense of Jerusalem in particular - last years sand-and-sword epics have dulled their bite. Instead between the noise of clattering swords thundering hoofs and the deadliest sound of all the lethal whisper of crossbow bolts the filmmakers have created space for provocative silences and challenging statements. At his world-weariest Jeremy Irons as Tiberias laments ""I thought we were fighting for God but we were fighting for wealth and land."" Never straying from issues of war and peace organized religion and an individuals relationship to God ""Kingdom of Heaven"" earns the right to rattle its swords.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Kingdom needs a horse; Bloom isnt itBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Orlando Blooms box office tallies and hunk-meter readings aside he fails to carry director Ridley Scotts Crusades epic. The movie leans toward the cerebral -- an uh-oh right there -- despite heavy on-screen blood loss. Orlando Bloom leads the Crusaders against Saladins vast Saracen army in Kingdom of Heaven. 20th Century Fox The dispiriting result of Blooms blandness is that in a movie touted as the first big-ticket picture of the summer even Edward Nortons leper king proves more interesting than Blooms French blacksmith. And Norton spends the entire movie behind a mask. Less brooding than chronically gloomy Blooms character comes by the condition honestly. Hes ostracized by the community following his wifes suicide a religious taboo. But the surprise appearance of his long-lost knight father (Liam Neeson) provides a respite immersing the lad into Christian-Muslim tensions in 12th-century Jerusalem. Neesons character teaches the lad some tricks of the trade before expiring too soon for the movies good. About the movie Kingdom of Heaven   (out of four) Stars Orlando Bloom Liam Neeson Jeremy Irons Eva Green Edward Norton David Thewlis Director Ridley Scott Distributor 20th Century Fox Running time 2 hours 25 minutes Rated R for strong violence and epic warfare. Opens Friday nationwide So its off to Jerusalem and a studio accountants headache How do you take a sides in a religiously contentious story when pricey productions need to recoup bushels of international dollars? As it turns out Heavens Muslim leader (Ghassan Massoud as Saladin) is enough of a principled guy to nearly steal the picture. And the Christians causing all the trouble are hotheads at odds with their superiors including Nortons king and polished members of his brain trust (Jeremy Irons David Thewlis). The heavies are the kings brother-in-law (Marton Csokas) and his volatile lieutenant (Brendan Gleeson with amazingly ratty hair and beard). Bloom manages to assimilate with all but these malcontents and even walks through a no-sparks romance with Csokas princess wife (Eva Green wearing three times the garments she did in Bernardo Bertoluccis NC-17 rated The Dreamers). But this is an epic and eventually you know that blazing arrows are bound to start flying into an armed fortress. Thats done with all the technical skill that Scott who also directed Black Hawk Down can muster. But by now the movie is an old-hat action situation. Dramatically even a persuasive supporting cast gets Heaven only so far. I know Gladiator somehow won the Oscar and The Duellist deserves its cult. But when you add them to 1492 Conquest of Paradise and now this lumbering film its tough to make the case that Scotts historical films show him at his best. See Black Hawk Down Thelma amp; Louise Alien Blade Runner and Matchstick Men for top-drawer alternatives Of course if the DVD really runs 80 minutes longer -- as Scott has hinted -- itll be a different movie. It makes you wonder if seeing the movie in theaters is beside the point.

The time is the late 12th century between the second and third Crusades and the place is Jerusalem where an uneasy truce has been struck between the leper King Baldwin IV (Edward Norton his face concealed beneath a smooth silvery mask) and the fearsome Muslim leader Saladin (Syrian actor Ghassan Masoud). But under pressure from extremists on both sides -- chief among them Baldwins warmongering would-be successor Guy de Lusignan (Martin Csokas) -- the detente proves short-lived. Evidence that where men and holy lands are concerned the more things change the more they remain the same. The model for Scotts new film (visually and thematically) is in many ways his beautiful and absurd debut feature The Duelists in which Joseph Conrads feuding Napoleonic soldiers pursued each other across great canvases of space and time until the cause of their initial conflict had become irretrievably blurred. In Kingdom of Heaven the dynamic is different -- Baldwin and Saladin can conceive of the peace though their armies cannot -- but the point is fundamentally the same The battle rages on because it is all that the combatants can conceive of. Forthrightly and unapologetically Scott and his screenwriter William Monahan have positioned Kingdom of Heaven as a tract against religious intolerance rife with philosophizing about the consequences of acts committed in Gods name that sounds decidedly more modern than medieval. (""We fight for an offense we did not give against those who were not alive to be offended"" reasons one of the films Christian knights -- an aphorism one could easily imagine popping up in a late-period Godard film.) I should add that Kingdom of Heaven for all its unusual (for Hollywood) polemical stance remains an expensive multinational product made somewhat by committee and designed for mass consumption by the largest possible audience. Throughout the film you sense how Scotts native intelligence and fanatical fascination with the period are at odds with a Hollywood superego telling him that the story must contain a reluctant warrior hero (Orlando Bloom as the blacksmith-turned-knight Balian) a beautiful love interest (sultry Eva Green as Baldwins sister Sibylla) and not one but two of those faux St. Crispins Day speeches delivered by said hero on the eve of battle. (Which is to say nothing of the de rigueur boiling down of complex political relationships into easily digestible morsels of good and evil.) But if the compromises are manifold theyre not nearly as many as they might have been resulting in a tempered thoughtful piece of mainstream entertainment that few will confuse with Andrei Rublev but which may nevertheless disappoint those who are expecting Gladiator II -- which in case you havent caught my drift I intend as a compliment. As Balian Bloom is more minimus than Maximus possessing about as much native authority as a postal clerk and hes effective for that very reason -- even though we know he must eventually rise to the occasion against Saladins encroaching hordes Bloom almost convinces us that he might at any given moment pack it all in and head back to the iron forge. And while Scott still can stage a battle sequence on par with the best of them in Kingdom of Heaven he spends as much or more time burying us in the aftermath of such engagements opting to keep one major confrontation (the bloody Battle of Hattin) entirely offscreen. Even once we arrive at the climactic (and very bloody) siege of Jerusalem Scott makes us feel the full moral weight of the blows landed by swords arrows and giant pots of boiling oil. By doing so he guarantees that the provocative question (and ambiguous answer) voiced late in Kingdom of Heaven will reverberate that much more troublingly into the night ""What is Jerusalem worth? Everything.

""Kingdom of Heaven"" navigates through the minefield of the Crusades and by extension the contentious background of Christian-Muslim relations in ways both shrewd and calculated. Genuinely spectacular and historically quite respectable Ridley Scotts latest epic is at its strongest in conveying the savagery spawned by fanaticism as well as in creating a convincing view of a late 12th century when East and West co-existed then came to blows for neither the first nor last time. Dramatically however there is a vaguely programmatic feel to the drastic upward mobility of a simple French blacksmith to the ruling echelon of the Latin Kingdom. Domestic B.O. prospects look robust if not gladiatorial while the international campaign will in line with the new wave of ancient spectacles net significantly more spoils. The notion of basing a 140 million Hollywood production on the most calamitous episode in the joint history of the worlds most dominant religions -- and at a time like this no less -- would run the gamut from unlikely to sheerest folly in the minds of cautious industry execs. But Scott and screenwriter William Monahan have craftily solved most of the thorny problems by beginning their tale toward the end of the nearly century-long truce that followed the Crusaders bloody conquest of Jerusalem in 1099; correctly pinning the lions share of the blame for reigniting hostilities on a couple of rash Christian belligerents; making the Muslims look good in comparison by more thoroughly detailing Frankish deviltry and perhaps most importantly bestowing the most sympathetic characters with an anachronistic post-French Enlightenment humanistic attitude that while not denying God at least suggests a desire on their part to take an extended vacation from doing His fighting. In this respect pic may irritate traditionalist Christians more than it will Muslims who can delight not only in the ending but in the hugely noble if one-dimensional portrait of the legendary warrior Saladin strikingly impersonated by Syrian actor Ghassan Massoud. But once all the intricate historical needle-threading is said and done its the story that counts. First-time scribe Monahan has done quite an adroit job merging fact with fiction shifting and adjusting certain elements to streamline and augment the drama but never betraying the subject matter in a way that remotely recalls the Hollywood approach epitomized by Cecil B. DeMilles laughably inauthentic 1935 epic ""The Crusades."" There really was a Balian who led the doomed defense of Jerusalem in 1187 but he was not the ordinary bloke vaulted to lofty rank played here by Orlando Bloom. Brooding over his wifes suicide after the death of their son this Balian is shaken from sullenness by the arrival in rural France of imposing knight Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson) who informs the youth hes his father and beckons him eastward. On the way Godfrey gives Balian fighting lessons before an ambush truncates the blooming father-son bond. But in his limited appearance Neeson excels his voice carrying the authority of experience and the lines around his eyes suggesting that nothing in life is any longer foreign to him. On his own Balian makes his way to bustling Jerusalem where he quickly assumes control of his esteemed fathers estate and sizes up the fractious factions that control the worlds most bitterly contested religious site. Ruled by a wise Christian king frail leper Baldwin IV (beautifully voiced by Edward Norton from behind a sculpted silver mask) the domain is further dominated by Baldwins comely sister Princess Sibylla (Eva Green); her snaky husband Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and the latters warmongering cohort Reynald of Chatillon (Brendan Gleeson). Balian finds more natural allies in Tiberias (Jeremy Irons) a peace-minded and pragmatic military expert and the Hospitaler (David Thewlis) a court counselor who has also seen enough fighting for one lifetime. With all these colorful and intriguing characters circling around the one in the center Balian looks bland by comparison. He seems uncomfortably like a reactor instead of an instigator a consciously concocted Everyman designed for audience identification who has greatness thrust upon him. Given that Balian is a cipher needing to be filled a bigger personality than Blooms would have helped. Upon arrival in Jerusalem Balian heads straight for Calvary and spends the night meditating at the site of Christs crucifixion hoping but failing to feel Gods grace. One never senses any urgency or anguish to Balians spiritual dilemma in Blooms performance nor even the more easily expressed ambivalence in his relationship with the enticing Sibylla who gives herself to him like a present and later schemes to install him in Guys place. Narrative contains significant gaps notably in the romance Balians adoption of his new home and especially in his rapid assimilation of military savvy. (Indeed Scott is on record as saying his definitive cut of the film runs 220 minutes a version he claims will be released on DVD.) Suddenly after Reynald has outrageously provoked Saladin by attacking a Saracen caravan for no reason it is Balian who warns in vain against Reynald and Guys ludicrous decision to take on Saladins army at the broiling Horns of Hattin a miscalculation that made Jerusalems fall inevitable. Scott strikingly shows not the massacre that was Hattin (ironically the same location where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount) but only its grisly aftermath so as to save the big action for Saladins siege on Jerusalem. Although much may be made of would-be contemporary parallels the filmmakers have actually gone out of their way to avoid them. The only scene that yanks the viewer into a modern mindset is Saladins opening salvo in which his fireballs lofted into the night sky above the walled city eerily evoke the initial U.S. nocturnal airborne attack on Baghdad. The sights and sounds of the battle are staggering with the enormous Saracen force bearing down on the Christian-held enclave with the help of enormous siege towers and trebuchets (giant catapults) and the vastly outnumbered Europeans holding their own with ingenious defenses that prominently include large amounts of boiling oil. Despite the huge scale and vivid carnage the sequence is a bit deflated by Balians quasi-Shakespearean speech thats meant to be inspiring but isnt. Resolution is essentially true to history. Among the cast vets Neeson Irons and Thewlis come off best along with Massoud. Green makes for a fetching princess although the role could have been a much more complex one torn as she is among her sovereign brother usurper husband and appealing new lover; as it is Green plays up her coquettish side and is allowed to smile too much. Scott is content with one-dimensional villains and Gleeson and Csokas indulge him with bluster glares and dismissive put-downs that are both delicious and far too easy. With John Mathieson behind the camera pic looks much like ""Gladiator"" bathed in blues and densified whenever possible with atmospheric particles such as snowflakes smoke dust and shafts of light. Arthur Maxs production design outdoes his efforts on the previous film conjuring a world particularly the amazing confluence of influences that was Jerusalem 800 years ago never before seen nearly so elaborately or credibly onscreen. Janty Yates diverse costume designs also contribute importantly. With CGI work improving all the time the mix of live and computerized elements creates numerous extraordinary canvases of virtually seamless quality. Harry Gregson-Williams score emphasizes the uniformly solemn tone of the proceedings while mixing in such diverse sounds as traditional and liturgical songs Arabic and world music and most surprisingly bits from ""The Crow"" ""Blade II"" and a piece by Jerry Goldsmith called ""Valhalla.""

"Kingdom of Heaven | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; kingdom-of-heaven ) Kingdom of Heaven (United States/United Kingdom/Spain 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli In Gladiator director Ridley Scott transported movie audiences to the year 180 AD. Five years and four motion pictures later the Oscar-winning director has again immersed himself in the blood and gore of hand-to-hand combat although this time the era is a millennium further along in history. Kingdom of Heaven is similar to Gladiator in many ways with large violent battle scenes and instances of great human courage and sacrifice proving that not all that much changed between the time of the Roman Empire and the Crusades. Where Kingdom of Heaven can be found lacking however is in its context. Although the story is streamlined so as not to confuse viewers theres a sense that a lot is missing - which of course is the case. Its 1184 and Balian (Orlando Bloom) is in mourning having recently buried his wife and child. Into his life during this dark period comes Baron Godfrey of Ibelin (Liam Neeson) who has decided to make himself known to his only son. The younger man agrees to accompany his father on a journey to Jerusalem to atone for his sins and those of his late wife (who committed suicide and by Catholic doctrine is consigned to hell). A battle on the road to Messina leaves Godfrey mortally wounded. Before he succumbs to the fever caused by his injury Godfrey knights Belian and confers upon him the title of Baron of Iblein. Months later after surviving a ship-wreck Balian arrives in Jerusalem as the ally of the leper king Baldwin IV (Edward Norton) and the Marshall of Jerusalem Tiberias (Jeremy Irons). One of the most influential men in the kings inner circle Guy de Lusignan (Marton Csokas) takes an instant dislike to Balian but that doesnt stop the new Baron of Ibelin from having an affair with Guys wife Sibylla the Princess of Jerusalem (Eva Green). Meanwhile in the lands surrounding the Holy City the Arab leader Saladin (Ghassan Massoud) is massing an army of 200000 men to take back Jerusalem from the Christians who have occupied it for 100 years. The film flouts history on a number of points that are worth noting more as curiosities than as criticisms. The romance between Balian and Sibylla is an invention of screenwriter William Monahan. According to the historical record Sibylla was happily married to Guy and was never linked sexually with Balian. (He had a wife and children who were very much alive.) In addition the succession did not pass directly from Baldwin IV to Sibylla as Kingdom of Heaven indicates. There was actually a brief period of rule for Baldwin V Sibyllas young son who died after only a few months reign. By fictionalizing these (and other) aspects of the historical record Scott and Monahan are able to develop a more dramatic story. The relationship between Balian and Sibylla is one of the films weaker points due in large part to the uneven manner in which it is developed. Its as if this started out as a significant aspect of the main storyline then was shoehorned into a minor subplot. A similar comment can be made about the antagonism between Balian and Guy which all-but-evaporates. (Guys fate is left ambiguous which is another minor source of frustration.) And the political backstory is greatly simplified. Even with those flaws exposed Kingdom of Heaven remains a hugely enjoyable experience. The battle scenes especially the 1187 siege of Jerusalem are handled expertly. Theres plenty of the same ""wow"" factor that was evident in The Two Towers when hundreds of thousands of orcs assaulted Helms Deep. Scott keeps the action tightly concentrated on Balian never losing focus the way Oliver Stone did in Alexander. Kingdom of Heaven runs nearly 2 1/2 hours but is tautly paced so as to not seem nearly that long. Kingdom of Heaven has a message as well. Ironically for a film about one of the most intolerant periods of human history Scott is preaching tolerance. Although the Arabs and Christians slaughter each other by the thousands during the course of the story it is ultimately a sense of mutual respect and understanding that avoids a final massacre. Its impossible not to note parallels to todays world situation and to recognize that Scott is reminding us of the age-old clichA(c) those who do not learn from history are destined to repeat it. One could argue that this is Orlando Blooms first dramatically heavy role as theres more heft to the part than to his other well-known characters (The Lord of the Rings Pirates of the Caribbean Troy). His performance is better than adequate but a step below eye opening. Hes a solid fit for the part and while there are times when he seems out of his league opposite Liam Neeson or Jeremy Irons for the most part he holds his own. Somewhat disappointing is Eva Green who after a seductive turn in The Dreamers shows little charisma or presence as Sibylla. The supporting actors playing the Arabs - Ghassan Massoud as Saladin and Alexander Siddig (of ""Star Trek Deep Space Nine"") as his right-hand-man Nasir - do superlative jobs bringing dignity and humanity to these roles. Kingdom of Heaven is unlikely to receive the same kind of Oscar buzz that surrounded Scotts Gladiator. Its neither as complete nor as rousing an experience. But compared to Troy the battle-soaked disappointment that started last years summer season its an improvement. Kingdom of Heaven may have problems but it delivers. You may not leave the theater feeling better educated about history or enlightened about the Crusades but you will leave satisfied that the filmmakers have delivered 145 minutes of exciting visceral cinema.
