"Just Married Just Awful washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Just Married Just Awful Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday January 10 2003 Its difficult to imagine a more thoroughly unpleasant experience than sitting through ""Just Married"" an abrasive unsavory assault on the senses starring Brittany Murphy and Ashton Kutcher. Remember those names if only for the purpose of reminding yourself of what passed for the Next Big Things in 2003. Actually Murphy probably has a future if she manages to avoid material like this but Kutcher -- who was the star of a television sitcom called ""That 70s Show"" -- is a performer best suited to the small screen. The smaller the better in fact. Here Murphy and Kutcher play Sarah McNerney and Tom Leezak two carefree young people who meet on a beach in Los Angeles fall into bed that night set up housekeeping a few weeks later and get married a few weeks after that. (Who said Hollywood doesnt believe in family values?) ""Just Married"" has to do mostly with their European honeymoon during which nearly everything that could go wrong does a phenomenon that in this case might appropriately be called Brittanys Law. Bloody noses head-butts a teensy weensy rental car a near-electrocution while plugging in a sexual aid a flatulent innkeeper a huge cockroach a half-dressed chase through a Venice hotel a rectal search at an Italian airport -- each gets the same goofy giggle from Murphy and mock-infuriated head shake from Kutcher. ""Just Married"" is a veritable orgy of strained physical gags inane vulgarity and poor comic timing. You know a movie is in trouble when its biggest laughs come not from its lead players but from a dog and a car. Kutcher and Murphy are a real-life couple but one would never know it from ""Just Married"" which in an hour and a half fails to spark any chemistry whatsoever between its protagonists. Its particularly painful to watch Murphy -- who was so perfectly cast as the love interest in ""8 Mile"" -- try to be Reese Witherspoon when her flashing eyes and dangerous just-kissed pout clearly indicate that her true calling is that of a bad girl with or without a heart of gold. Unremarkably directed by Shawn Levy (""Big Fat Liar"") from an execrable script by Sam Harper ""Just Married"" is the kind of movie whose existence is completely unjustified save for the two careers its supposed to ignite. Whether audiences comply is their business but with so many terrific movies out right now they can surely find something better to do with their time than serve as human jumper cables. Just Married (95 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content crude humor and a brief drug reference.

Its one thing for a movie to unabashedly revel in its obnoxiousness as in the case of Dude Wheres My Car? This film -- which has the same star Ashton Kutcher -- thinks its being cute when in fact its being exceedingly irritating. The irritation is accomplished with surprising ease by the affable and cute Kutcher and a tough chick turned softie Brittany Murphy. Murphy has done much better in serious roles; 8 Mile put her hard edges to good use. Here she appears to have studied at the Goldie Hawn School of Adorableness but she sure doesnt win our hearts. The movie opens with the couples bitter fighting and little evidence of the chemistry that gossip columnists say led to real-life romance. Actually bitter is putting it kindly. After a disastrous honeymoon along the lines of National Lampoons European Vacation the pair go at it in the airport more viciously than Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York. Murphy falsely accuses Kutcher of smuggling hashish and subjects him to a body cavity search. He body-slams her into a steaming cup of hot coffee and nearly runs her over. This is our introduction to the crazy lovebirds. Were supposed to wonder what went so hideously wrong but instead we get the sense that they have just revealed their true mean-spirited colors. Review of the movie Just Married ( out of four) Stars Brittany Murphy Ashton Kutcher Christian Kane David Rasche Director Shawn Levy Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG-13 for for sexual content some crude humor and a brief drug reference Opens Friday nationwide There are the forced anything-for-a-laugh moments Kutcher goes to Europe without having the slightest clue that his electrical appliances wont plug into overseas sockets. He stubbornly jams the cord into the wall and sets off an explosion. Kutcher transcends the ugly-American stereotype segueing into downright hideous and insultingly xenophobic. We later learn he started out a sensitive guy chock-full of integrity. And were supposed to buy that simply setting foot on European soil unleashes his inner redneck? Just Married is not without some stupidly funny moments. Murphys wealthy mother insists after the engagement that Kutcher call her by a family nickname Pussy and his efforts are appropriately comical. But the plot follows a trite teen romantic comedy formula that never ceases to telegraph itself long in advance ordinary boy meets rich girl; rich parents hate ordinary boy; rich former boyfriend tries to win back girl; the pair fight then make up and everybody beams. Meanwhile the viewer cant help but cringe.

Ashton Kutcher and his costar Seann William Scott made goo-goo eyes at each other as if they were stuck in a casually homoerotic ""Bill amp; Ted"" sequel. The screwball honeymoon farce Just Married is a lot more conventional but it allows Kutcher once again to fashion himself into a cuddle-bug pinup. The heir to teen idols like David Cassidy and Rob Lowe hes the sort of hot-yet-harmless young actor who appeals to the girls who read fanzines because hes handsome in a girlish way himself his tall frame and shaggy hippie hair set off by androgynous Bambi eyelashes and a ruby-lipped smile of reassuring delicacy. Just asking Does Ashton Kutcher really want to look as if hes wearing enough cosmetics to rival Prince? In ""Just Married"" hes supposed to be playing an antic sports-fixated yob who meets Brittany Murphy as a posh and perfect daddys girl and leaps into marriage before hes even close to ready for it. The snooty rich in-laws he can handle but as the newlyweds travel through Europe veering from one culture-clash disaster to the next the underlying joke is that its Kutcher far more than Murphy whos the spoiled bratty princess. Whatever goes wrong (and just about everything does) he cant deal and this young actor who carries himself with a blitzed air of proprietary glee as if he were the class clown on spring break knows that hes the movies true love object. He plays to the teen female peanut gallery by becoming adorably unglued in one cute predicament after the next. At the foot of the Alps Kutcher and Murphy zoom around in a yellow tin can of a French car a vehicle so compact that it looks as if it had been smashed like an accordion into a granite cliff. The sight gag comes to life because of Kutchers stylized irritation at having to squish into that car; he has another good bit in Venice when he does slapstick battle with the pigeons in St. Marks Square. Murphy playing straight woman to these antics proves unexpectedly charming like a junior Meg Ryan without the self-adoring tics. Up until now she has made a calling card of her baby-doll lewdness but if Murphy wants a future in mainstream romantic comedy she appears to have the chops for it. In its cellophane-thin way ""Just Married"" is a portrait of a Gen-Y ""starter marriage"" featuring two characters who love each other yet havent a clue as to how to negotiate the delicate power dynamics of an adult relationship. As long as theyre playing out that tension via the logistical difficulties of travel abroad (e.g. those pesky European electrical outlets) the movie is lively dumb fun. But it makes a crucial wrong turn when it segues into a comedy of sexual jealousy. Paranoid over Murphys preppy ex-flame who just happens to be staying in Venice Kutcher picks up a bimbo of his own who leaves behind a telltale bra even though the two didnt actually do anything...you get the idea. ""Just Married"" collapses into the most generic sort of teen movie-ville just at the moment its convinced you that its lightly appealing stars are capable of better.

Mark Twains innocents abroad werent as clueless as the sparring Yank newlyweds at the center of the inchoate ""Just Married."" Although the pics makers continuously tease the young spouses on their oh-so-American style as they travel through Europe on a disastrous honeymoon the filmmakers themselves betray a lack of knowledge about the Old World while unfailingly repeating physical hijinks one time too many. This latest project from producer Robert Simonds however is at least a rung above his other recent output ""Corky Romano"" ""Joe Dirt"" ""See Spot Run"" and ""Head Over Heels."" Early January escapade will quickly get a visa to video destinations. Reportedly inspired by scripter Sam Harpers own honeymoon story begins as Tom (Ashton Kutcher) and Sarah (Brittany Murphy) deplane at LAX each pummeling the other in an ongoing mutual fit of rage. He drops her off at her rich familys palatial mansion in his aging auto making sure he destroys as much landscaping as possible on his way out. After showing youths acting ugly and vicious the movie struggles through the next reels to undo this impression. It does this awkwardly by showing Tom a radio traffic reporter and sports- talk host wannabe wondering what went wrong as he flashes back to Sarah and him meeting cute on the beach 10 months earlier. Shes the quintessential Beverly Hills princess (art major at Wellesley) while hes a working-class poster boy (two-year degree from Burbank Community College). After a whirlwind courtship and a nine-month live-in tryout they head to the altar. ""Just Married"" delivers an occasional genuine laugh as when Tom accidentally ensures that Sarahs toy boxer goes to dog heaven -- a secret he keeps from Sarah but not from buddy Kyle (David Moscow) whos as skeptical of the marriage as is Sarahs icy sister Dickie (Taran Killam). (The doggie mishap is amusing on first viewing and much much less so when its shown again later.) The seeds of future trouble are planted by Sarahs insistence on truth-telling in marriage but her concealing her true relationship with moneybags beau Peter (Christian Kane) continues to haunt the pair in various ways. Pic skips to the honeymoon suite where the pair finds numerous ways not to have sex but several ways to get bloody noses. As the honeymooners cross the Pond to Europe the mishaps -- ranging from near-crashes in a Euro-scale compact car to smashing down walls in a Venetian pensione -- pile up too quickly pushing Kutcher and Murphy to play them more and more broadly under helmer Shawn Levys direction. The mishaps along with the running gag of Tom and Sarah not having sex soon run out of gas. In addition the European setting seems less than realistic. At one point for example the sound of televised baseball in an Yank-style sports bar tucked in a Venetian side street can be heard many blocks away deep inside the vast Piazza San Marco. Christophe Becks music also seems geographically challenged with Gallic-style accordion ditties and Argentine tango riffs underscoring action in Italy. True to the standard comedy template the marrieds break up but then get together in a sentimental finale that wastes the real gifts of David Rasche as Sarahs snooty pere and Raymond J. Barry as Toms stiff-upper-lip dad. Although never as funny as in ""Dude Wheres My Car?"" Kutcher comes as close as anyone to enjoying himself while Murphy tries much too hard to be the winning comedienne. Alp and Lido locations form the visual highlights of an otherwise plain filmmaking palette and production designer Nina Ruscio enjoyably plays around with designing a range of lavish rooms including several upscale Continental hotel suites.
