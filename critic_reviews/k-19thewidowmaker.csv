No it isnt the theater playing K-19 The Widowmaker but dont count your blessings yet. Sitting through this 2 1/4-hour Russian-sub epic is grind enough even if your multiplex is one of those with cushy seats and a deluxe snack bar that serves chef salads and vodka. Harrison Ford plays the part of a Russian submarine commander in K-19 The Widowmaker. Paramount Pictures Plodding through a shattering true-life story that sounds as if it would just have to engross Paramounts nuclear follow-up to The Sum of All Fears is another overreaching underachiever. Based on a 1961 incident that was hushed up until Russian communism fell it casts Harrison Ford (commander) and Liam Neeson (subordinate) as rival captains on a nuclear missile submarine that runs worse than the first used car you ever owned. The movie justifiably hammers a government that would put this vessel in service and it would be interesting to see if a modern-day Russian-produced screen equivalent would be so critical. But for now heres Ford sporting a Russian accent which is more tolerable than not though it hardly plays to the actors strengths. Passed over for command a more credible Neeson second-guesses most of Fords moves once the jinxed vessel finds its nuclear reactor overheating to deadly extremes 1000 feet under the sea. A welding-repair job exposes the repairers to burns and worse and the sub to only slightly less contamination. The fallout is ugly -- first physically then politically (at least for Ford). Heres the test for second-rate movies that still work especially in the action genre Are there two or three scenes staged with enough electricity to carry the other 100 minutes that merely break even? The answer here is no and fellow sub-pic enthusiasts will marvel again that the expanded DVD version of the first-rate Das Boot (3 hours 29 minutes) never bogs down despite an even more claustrophobic setting. Claustrophobia is of course a built-in dramatic hazard in submarine movies and director Kathryn Bigelow (also behind the overloaded Point Break and Strange Days) has limited options. When late in the movie Ford finally spouts a funny line that got the only laugh from my packed house you realize that a little humor goes a long way and might have helped leaven what is obviously a very grim story. Though this saga would be terrific to read about it is dicey screen material that only a genius should touch. With no genius in sight K-19 might be headed for meltdown.

(HANDOUT PHOTO) Photo HANDOUT IN DEEP / In K-19 Soviet submarine officers struggle on the brink of nuclear catastrophe 1 / 2 Back to Gallery K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER Drama. Starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""K-19 The Widowmaker"" sneaks up like a submarine. Its opening is a whole lot of soundtrack pumping up a small bit of who cares A Soviet submarine is assigned to detonate a test missile in the North Atlantic. But the movie gradually works its way with quiet intelligence and apparent conviction until theres no turning from it. An hour in and were on that boat. Based on a horrific real-life incident that happened in 1961 -- and that might have led to a nuclear nightmare -- the picture pairs Soviet submarine captain Harrison Ford and his second-in-command Liam Neeson who are forced to work together though they have distinctly different styles. Neeson plays Polenin a genial officer loved by his men who is removed from the helm of the K-19 when he is unable to get the boat ready in time for a dangerous mission. Hes demoted to first officer and placed under the command of Capt. Vostrikov a hard-nosed disciplinarian played by Ford in his patented if-I-smile-my-face-might-crack mode. Life in a submarine is bad enough as anyone who ever saw ""Das Boot"" knows but life in a physically compromised submarine is even worse. ""K-19"" is a kind of ""Das Lousy Boot"" about the valor of the men stuck inside a vessel that should never have gone to sea in the first place. Its also about hard choices and life-and-death decisions and two officers at each others throats. In most naval movies whenever theres a clash between two officers we know which one embodies the movies point of view. ""K-19"" throws us a curve. In Polenin we see a reasonable and humane man who commands a lazy feel-good crew. In Vostrikov we see a stronger military man whos also cold and dangerously reckless. Who is the better leader? In leaving this question open the movie does more than play cute with the audience. It replicates the dilemma of the officers aboard the K-19. That ""K-19"" could be made at all is a testament to improved relations between the United States and Russia. With the Cold War now history we can now look back and admit the humanity of the other side. The K-19s mission to set off a test missile was designed to strike fear in President Kennedy and alert the American government of the Soviets ability to wreak destruction from nuclear submarines. However if this movie is any judge Kennedy should have been more worried that the Soviets might blow up the Eastern Seaboard by accident not intention. Director Kathryn Bigelow (""Strange Days"") gives us time to take in life aboard the submarine to get a sense of the cramped conditions and the fragility of the vessel. In a particularly smart shot she pans from a seaman lying inside his bunk through the wall of his room to the outside of the submarine. Its just a thin metal wall separating them from all getting swallowed. From there the movie starts piling on catastrophes not in a sensational action-movie way but with an adult sense of contained horror. Bigelow is known for making good visceral movies but here she adopts a kind of dignified watchfulness and that feels right for the material. Most of ""K-19"" is like an undersea ""China Syndrome"" with the men fighting to prevent a nuclear meltdown that could lead to Armageddon. Its an effort that entails daunting sacrifices which ""K-19"" renders graphically but also with compassion. Ford and Neeson work well together. Their characters go on a journey and by the time they get to the other side theyre different. We believe in their changes even if we dont always believe in Fords accent. At one point he sounds as if hes trying to sound Irish. Still no one could do stoic quite like Ford. In ""K-19"" hes so stoic that when he tries to smile his eyes go screwy and his face goes lopsided. Like Humphrey Bogart. The men in ""K-19"" also undergo changes and thats stirring as well. They go not only from self-interest to heroism but also from heroism to intelligent heroism. By the end theyre not heroes of a Soviet state thats unworthy of them but of a world that only now is becoming privy to their sacrifice. . This film contains strong language and grim images of illness and death.

"Tension Tumult Trauma Run Deep - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Sailors Tension Tumult Trauma Run DeepMovies - REVIEW - K-19 The WidowmakerSub Thriller Proves Fathomable With Neeson And Ford.July 19 2002|By Roger Moore Sentinel Staff WriterK-19 The Widowmaker is a sad and noble submarine thriller a somber and heroic variation on a genre that has proven to be a cinema evergreen. Its a well-acted spin on The Caine Mutiny. ""Inspired by"" an actual Soviet sub accident its a film that has the ring of truth about it thanks to the loss of the Russian submarine Kursk and revelations about what caused that sinking.Liam Neeson is Polenin who is to captain the Soviet navys first nuclear ballistic missile submarine the K-19. He has worked his crew battled the shipyard and the military brass to get the vessel ready. He isnt willing to compromise the ships safety for the Motherland.So he is displaced. Capt. Vostrikov(Harrison Ford) a senior politically connected skipper is brought in to take the sub to sea.""We deliver or we drown"" he informs Polenin.With deadly and complicated equipment that the green crew doesnt understand and a callous fatalistic new captain the drowning seems more likely. Superstitious sailors label the ship unlucky ""The Widowmaker."" But its 1961 the very height of the Cold War. The Soviets to maintain the balance of ""mutually assured destruction"" must match the new American trump card our A-bomb armed submarine fleet. So the K-19 heads to sea safety be damned.The hull creaks and groans from the crushing pressure. Sailors stare wide-eyed at every drip plopping from the damp leaky pipes. The corridors are crowded the bulkheads low the torpedoes as dangerous to their crews as they are to the enemy. And theres always a gauge that sticks requiring someone to tap on it to make it work. The conventions of the submarine thriller are movie comfort food.Action director Kathryn Bigelow whose career dropped off the radar after the gargantu-flop Strange Days uses those familiar ingredients as seasoning in what is essentially a character study of men facing horrific choices. The choices arrive in the form of what became the hallmark of the Soviet system -- an accident.K-19 is no Red October/U-571-style hunt-and-hunted thriller. The sub here is a crucible where character mettle and metal are tested. The movie makes the most of the novelty that these men are the faceless commie enemy humanized. It has taken this long for a Hollywood movie to allow the Soviets to show patriotism even as the film condemns a heartless unworkable political system for flinging brave sailors into battle with inferior hardware.The cast a mix of Hollywood international and Eastern European actors speaks variations of ""Hollywood Russian"" with mixed results. Ford takes a shot at it Neeson rarely bothers and old pros like Joss Ackland lay it on thick.Other details from the borscht and red wine served the crew (the wine helps protect against radiation) to the forlorn balalaika music on the soundtrack are spot-on.And the players hit many of the right emotional marks especially Neeson. Ford may struggle with playing a man who could be either a patriot or a suicidal fanatic but Neeson brings pathos to a deceptively heroic role. As in other sub movies the rest of the crew are relative unknowns but perfectly solid in playing stoics martyrs cowards and schemers.Bigelow and the screenwriters didnt know how to end this thing which leads to several anticlimactic super-titled postscripts ripped from the pages of history. But she nails the emotion and just enough of the details to make K-19 a serviceable addition to the roster of submarine thrillers. Its no Das Boot Crimson Tide or The Enemy Below. But its no embarrassment either.

Now comes K-19 The Widowmaker a lavish submarine pic that does something that never would have happened before the Berlin Wall came down It glorifies the heroic sailors of the Soviet Motherland. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Based on a little-known real-life episode the story takes place in 1961 the heyday of MAD the aptly acronymed theory of mutually assured destruction. In order to make its nuclear deterrent plausible (so the U.S. wont dare attack) the Soviets believe they must quickly launch their underwater flagship the nuclear-missile submarine K-19. The sub isnt seaworthy -- its got leaks bursting fuses faulty reactors -- but the high command doesnt care. And so Captain Alexi Vostrikov (Harrison Ford) is ordered to assume command of the sub replacing its original commander Captain Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) who serves as his second-in-command. Together they take K-19 on its maiden voyage which almost instantly turns into a disaster with overheating reactors radiation invading chamber after chamber and the clock ticking down toward an unwanted atomic blast that could well trigger World War III. To make matters even dodgier the ships two commanders seem to be rehearsing for a Soviet production of Mutiny on the Bounty (by way of The Caine Mutiny and Crimson Tide). Where Vostrikov is an iron-fisted martinet of the old school -- hes always pushing his men and the submarine to dangerous extremes -- the humanistic Polenin sees the ship and its crew as a family and worries that Vostrikov will get everyone killed rather than let his mission be tarred with failure.On the face of it its hard to see how K-19 ever got made -- at least by Hollywood. The American public hasnt exactly been clamoring for an in-depth portrait of life on old Soviet subs; nor has it been crying out for a story in which Harrison Ford plays a Communist SOB. In fact I suspect the only reason the movie got made was that Ford himself relished the chance to play a version of Captain Ahab--Bligh--Queeg. After years of polishing his image as an American icon hes now doing what Clint Eastwood has done for decades -- chipped away at his heroic persona. He played a murderous adulterer in his last film What Lies Beneath and if anything hes even more unlikable here. His feathery-haired Captain Vostrikov moves through the submarine like an irascible owl pissed off at both his crews slackness and the lousy tin can the Party has ordered him to command.For years I insisted that Ford was the dullest living white man (this was pre--Chris ODonnell of course) yet its always been one of Fords strengths that his bland good looks and flattish line readings have been enriched by an undertone of grumpiness that feels habitual. Now that his features have grown so craggy -- in K-19 he looks every day of his 60 years -- this ill-tempered edge suits him. Although his Russian accent is only working part time he dominates his scenes with Neeson who as usual is as solid as a shillelagh and only marginally more expressive. In fact Fords so good at playing the unpleasant tough guy one keeps hoping that K-19s writers Louis Nowra and Christopher Kyle wont feel the need to tenderize him.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Unlike her lead actors director Kathryn Bigelow always goes full out which is both her virtue and her curse. Over the past 17 years she has carved out a fascinating Hollywood career building up a peculiar body of work that includes a superb vampire pic Near Dark; one deliriously goofy surf-heist hit Point Break (whose heros very name Johnny Utah made me chortle); an overintellectualized feminist cop thriller Blue Steel; and the apocalyptic Strange Days a savage commentary on the politics of voyeurism that was probably the most unfairly reviled Hollywood film of the 90s. (Her last film 2000s The Weight of Water was never released in the States.) Determinedly unfeminine in her directorial style -- she makes Oliver Stone look like Penny Marshall -- Bigelow is uncommonly gifted at all the high-torque stuff that women arent supposed to care about. Bigelow likes the world of men and in K-19 she not only gazes lovingly at all those fresh-faced young sailors (she has an eye for good-looking fellas) but displays an equal ardor for glowing dials rocket blasts and the masculine sense of duty that leads several of the lead characters to sacrifice themselves to save their mates and keep their country from blundering into nuclear war.Bigelow is one of the worlds best action directors and working with legendary editor Walter Murch she puts together some extraordinary sequences for K-19 -- especially the one in which Vostrikov first drops the sub so far it is almost crushed by the water pressure then orders it to race upward from these depths and crash through a meter-thick layer of ice. Perhaps because she began as a painter shes always had an instinctual awareness of how to use space and the movie could serve as a textbook in the use of scale from the crane shots of K-19s vastness in its snowy dry dock to the edgy moving camera and pell-mell editing that captures the claustrophobic horror of being aboard a doomed submarine.Unlike James Cameron or John Woo -- to name two of her peers in directing action -- Bigelow has never really been good at pleasing the mass audience. People complain that her work is cold and thats true. But shes also profoundly romantic and this peculiar blend of the icy and the headlong can inspire unease like watching two strangers making out passionately at the table next to you at a fancy restaurant You watch but youre no part of it. Far from being a heartless hipster Bigelow doesnt have an ironic bone in her body and watching K-19 I kept hoping for flashes of the delectable Russian sense of absurdity found in works such as Om On Ra (Viktor Pelevins sly novel about the Soviet space program) or My Friend Ivan Lapshin Aleksei Germans offbeat movie about an eccentric secret policeman in the Soviet provinces. No such luck. While what happens to Vostrikov and his crew is undeniably grim -- can you imagine being sent out in a nuclear sub without a single radiation suit? -- the storys real interest should probably lie not in the situation but in the complicated ways that very different characters react to it. And this is what we never get.Indeed K-19 is so unnervingly square that it seems eerily like Party-sanctioned Soviet filmmaking Its Motherland-loving sailors myth-making shots of K-19 and displays of heroism are worthy of the Young Lenin Pioneers Handbook. Although such cliches recall the aesthetic known as Socialist Realism whats obvious and bombastic in the movie is equally intrinsic to Hollywood movies like Saving Private Ryan and Pearl Harbor. Nearly everything annoying about the picture comes straight from the studio playbook including a hectoring score complete with womens chorus. We might well dub its style Paramount Realism in honor of the studio that is releasing it. Bigelow has never made a film with so little going on beneath the surface and I can just picture those meetings with the commissars from Paramount""Comrade Bigelow your last few films have not pleased the people because you have confused them with your decadent ideas and bourgeois subtleties. Now you must play the womens chorus very loud -- the Chairman likes them very much -- and show many handsome photos of brave Soviet soldiers. You must deliver a timeless message of uplift.

By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer (CNN) -- In June 1961 just a year after Francis Gary Powers U2 spy plane was shot down over the USSR and 16 months before the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world to the brink of war a brand-new Soviet nuclear submarine the K-19 was launched on its maiden voyage. After the successful test firing of a missile in the Arctic Sea the sub was off the eastern coast of the United States when disaster struck. Shown from the Soviet point of view the film ""K-19 The Widowmaker"" starring Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson tells the dramatic story of how a group of brave sailors saved their sub and perhaps the whole world from a nuclear holocaust. The movie opens with Captain Alexei Vostrikov (Ford) being sent by the Soviet High Command to test-run the K-19. America has successfully launched its first nuclear Polaris missile submarine the USS George Washington. Not to be left behind in the arms race the Soviets have decided to launch the K-19 before she has been completely tested. The original captain of the boat Mikhail Polenin (Neeson) is replaced by Vostrikov when its decided Polenin is not proceeding quickly enough to meet the deadline. However hes kept on as second-in-command due to his extensive knowledge of the sub.

If that doesnt sound exciting be aware that Liam Neeson also plays a Soviet navy captain and that the films central action starts when the crewmen enter the core of the subs damaged nuclear cooling system exposing themselves to sickening doses of radiation. (Its like watching a thriller about the cleanup of Chernobyl.) The director Kathryn Bigelow works with hurtling technical prowess yet shes stuck making a grim historical message movie that hits us with the breaking news that the arms race was in every sense a poisonous game.

With a stalwart sense of mission mirroring that of its characters ""K-19 The Widowmaker"" obediently follows the verities of the submarine movie and its true story origins but without the imagination needed to refresh the genre. Those who remember ""Das Boot"" ""The Bedford Incident"" and ""Run Silent Run Deep"" will appreciate pics specific salutes to sub classics as well as its avoidance of contempo actioner tricks. But outline of the actual 1961 incident -- in which Soviet K-19 nuclear-powered sub nearly experienced total meltdown during the Cold War -- tends to bog down rather than inspire the drama. Because it marks Harrison Fords return to his best star fit as a rough man of action pic should open strongly but sustainability will be challenged by unfortunate Yank disinterest in Cold War history from the Soviet perspective. Such apathy is ironic Embarrassed Communist party officials and military brass swore survivors of the second of K-19s several mishaps (boat was later darkly dubbed ""Hiroshima"" by mates) to secrecy about the Atlantic episode which the now-public record and pic clearly blames on incompetent and rushed Soviet ship production and maintenance as well as undue political pressure to keep up with the U.S. Some Russian filmmakers doubtless feel that this was their story to tell but like ""Paths of Glory"" and its shaming of French brass in WWI American filmmaking might has invaded the territory first. Much more comfortably than Pars recent action-drama ""The Sum of All Fears"" which uneasily tried to make itself into a Cold War thriller ""K-19"" really is that although the efforts to be fully Russian in mood attitude and (especially) language sometimes show considerable strain. The link to ""Sum"" doesnt only involve Ford (the former Jack Ryan) and Yank-Russo conflict but also the opening sequence which uncomfortably repeats ""Sums"" gambit of creating the illusion of a thermonuclear crisis only to then reveal that it was only an exercise. Though echo may be accidental it hardly helps pic get off to a roaring start. Running afoul of protocol and his new boats shoddy mechanics the K-19s skipper Mikhail Polenin (Liam Neeson) is upstaged by superiors who place Capt. Alexei Vostrikov (Ford) in command. Vostrikovs own skepticism about shipping the untested sub out to the maritime front lines is shot down by top chief Marshal Zelentstov (Joss Ackland). Though Christopher Kyles script (based on Louis Nowras story) deletes mention of K-19s first nuke reactor problems it replaces it with doses of Russian mysticism in the form of bad omens The man in charge of the reactor is found drunk; an untested rookie named Vadim (Peter Sarsgaard) replaces him; the christening bottle of champagne fails to crack on the hull; and the boats doctor is killed in a freak accident. Unfortunately Kyles script also insists on reviewing this litany through frequently literal-minded dialogue. Neeson fights off the dialogues anchoring effect though with a performance that evolves by stages. Initially both loyal to his equally loyal men and slightly rebellious to authority his Polenin adapts to an obedient secondary role under Vostrikov until he gradually senses that the captain is pushing his men and the boat too hard with actions that include a near-fatal move in the polar ice to test-fire a nuke missile (whose destination remains oddly unexplained). Like the best moments between Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster in ""Run Silent"" the clash between Neeson and Ford is weighted equally so that each man has his case to argue -- even though Fords odd twists in his Russian-accented English during his angriest exchanges become a bit of a distraction from an otherwise solid portrayal. Vostrikovs successful missile test wins both the loyalty of the crew and the faith of the Kremlin which quickly assigns K-19 Atlantic missile control sending it on a course to directly face the U.S. coast between Washington D.C.  and Gotham. Centerpiece of action immediately bursts forth when a leak in the reactor sets off overheating risking a meltdown. Since the leak is in a sealed area Vostrikov must assign pairs of men to go inside and manually weld the leak even though their entry will release a potentially uncontrollable radioactive spread through the sub. Intensity of the situation peaks as the contamination reaches full effect scarring and sickening crew with a rapidity that shocks even the stone-faced Vostrikov and unhinges Vadim until he redeems himself with desperate heroics. Though director-producer Kathryn Bigelow might be expected to bring to the project her heightened sense of technologys effect on people what surprises is how plain and traditional she is with the action and storytelling. Her occasionally roving camera deliberately recalls some of the spatial excitement of ""Das Boot"" (also recalled in the presence of political ""officers"" on board who make nothing but mischief) but pic is otherwise true to the sub movie faith down to the dusty cliches -- sailors pining for their beloved helicopter shots of the skipper at the helm in private reflection mutinies and mutinies reversed. Climax of nuke incident though roughly accurate factually is rather dull lacking the suspenseful build of a ""Hunt for Red October"" while aftermath in 1989 as the Berlin Wall falls and surviving crew reunites contains a well-considered wintry end-of-era feeling as well as a preview of what a senior citizen Ford may look like. Physical filmmaking shares the lead with Ford and Neeson who are both exceptionally up for the mission. Jeff Cronenweths lensing and production design by Karl Juliusson and Michael Novotny stress a closed-in world of rust rot and nausea-producing greens and Walter Murchs editing maintains a full-speed approach without ever being carried away with cutting for its own sake. Visual fx are minimal and highly convincing while the sound (care of vet Murch associates) becomes a character unto itself when not drowned out by Klaus Badelts overdone score. Combined opening and closing credits total nearly 10 minutes.
