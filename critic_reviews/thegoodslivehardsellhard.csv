Trailing a wake of strippers and lager Don and his crew are summoned to Temecula California by James Brolins car-lot owner. He needs them to punt 200 cars over a July holiday weekend otherwise his business will be turned into rehearsal space for the vile Ed Helms and his boy band sorry man band. Swearing and innuendo are the order of the day with most gags imploding midway and climaxing in a mess of semi-improvised cussing. A throng of outrageous supporting characters do little to salvage this stalled effort.

Comments click to enlarge The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard 2009 A hired-gun car salesman (Jeremy Piven) and his crew of eccentric sales associates (Ving Rhames David Koechner Kathryn Hahn) come to the rescue of an ailing California dealership during a three-day Fourth of July blowout. This frantic vulgar but often clever comedy seems to have been inspired by John Landiss little-seen documentary Slasher (2004) though the dealerships rivalry with a neighboring car lot may also call to mind the old Robert Zemeckis classic Used Cars (1980). Its a grab bag of comic ideas but some of the gags are impressively perverse (like Hahns lust for a ten-year-old boy whose glandular abnormality has turned him into a full-grown man). First-time director Neal Brennan is best known for having partnered with Dave Chappelle on the cult sketch-comedy series Chappelles Show; the cast includes Ed Helms Ken Jeong and Rob Riggle.

The milieu may bring back fond memories of Robert Zemeckis 1980 ""Used Cars."" To be clear Theres not a single shot in ""The Goods"" helmed by debut feature director Neal Brennan (""Chappelles Show"") that you could describe as carefully composed or pictorially vivid. But the script by Andy Stock and Rick Stempson offers a fair number of low cheap verbally adroit and usually filthy laughs. I used to think quality was everything when it came to screen comedies even stupid ones but quantitys important too. The Goods"" does not seem poised to take over the world the way a more acceptably raunchy comedy like ""The Hangover"" did but the writers have talent and they believe in keeping the gab fast and loose. And any film that has veteran character actor Charles Napier attacking a customer in the opening seconds cannot be dismissed outright. Rogue salesfolk for hire Piven and his fellow closers played with unruly relish by Ving Rhames David Koechner and Kathryn Hahn are hired by Temecula Calif. used-car legend Ben Selleck (James Brolin) to move the inventory pronto over a 4th of July weekend. ""The Goods"" cooks up just enough narrative fodder to hold this jalopy together Does Don Ready have a grown son hes never met? Will he and the boss daughter played by Jordana Spiro get together? The supporting cast include Craig Robinson playing a character named DJ Request which gives him the opportunity to say ""NOBODY tells DJ Request what to play"" Hacky technique? Yes. All over the place. More misses that hits in the joke department whether the jokes involve lap dancers or not? Check. Piven a little too practiced at this sort of wheeler-dealer by now? I believe he may be. Yet I laughed more than I thought I would (though of course hope springs eternal at the movies) and if I ran the Hollywood zoo Id give these particular screenwriters another assignment. MPAA rating R (for sexual content nudity pervasive language and some drug material)Running time 129Starring Jeremy Piven (Don ""The Goods"" Ready); Ving Rhames (Jibby Newsome); James Brolin (Ben Selleck); Jordana Spiro (Ivy); David Koechner (Brent Gage); Kathryn Hahn (Babs Merrick); Ken Jeong (Teddy Dang); Charles Napier (Dick Lewiston); Craig Robinson (DJ Request); Ed Helms (Paxton Harding)Directed by Neal Brennan; written by Andy Stock and Rick Stempson; produced by Adam McKay Will Ferrell Kevin Messick and Chris Henchy.

He may be the movies big drawn but her performance outshines his. Thursday August 13 2009 323 PM The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard  2 starsA wild-man car salesman and his team save a failing company. At area theaters (129). R Language sexuality. A hyperactive comedy that owes a lot to anarchic late-70s and 80s flamethrowers like ""Used Cars"" ""The Goods"" gets points for being true to itself and energetic -- and filled with goofy cameos most notably co-producer Will Ferrell -- but it ultimately exhausts itself to the point that it runs on fumes. Jeremy Piven (""Entourage"") is an obnoxious supersalesman brought in to save a failing small-town dealership. He and his team (which includes a stoical Ving Rhames) overrun a sleepy California town seduce its daughters and run roughshod over propriety. The oh-so-out-there mentality earns some chuckles but that along with Pivens preening gets very trying. A hard sell is still a hard sell. Joe NeumaierIt Might Get Loud3 starsThree renowned rock guitarists share their musical passions. At the Empire 25 and Sunshine Cinema (137). PG Brief language. It does of course get loud in Davis Guggenheims mash note of a movie which unites a trio of guitar greats for whats billed as a sort of rock star summit. But few of the parts harmonize properly leaving us with provocative fragments rather than an electrifying whole.The subjects are Jimmy Page the Edge and Jack White all of whom offer brief allusions to their pasts and passions. In between we return to a soundstage where these outsized talents awkwardly connect unable to ignite the sort of chemistry theyve found with their bandmates. What Guggenheim really does is make the case that each man deserves his own movie; this one feels like an especially well-produced VH1 special. Elizabeth WeitzmanSpread2 starsA high-end hustler tries to make it in Hollywood. At the Empire 25 and Village 7 (131). R Language sex nudity.Presumably if there are millions of people hanging on Ashton Kutchers every tweet there will be millions of people willing to watch him work. While naked.As pretty and shallow as its lead David Mackenzies uneven drama finds Kutcher playing callous gigolo to vulnerable older women in L.A. (A terrific Anne Heche is the movies standout.) His rise is fun to watch but the inevitable fall feels soulless and stale. Anne Heche as Samantha and Ashton Kutcher as Nikki in Spread. He may be the movies big drawn but her performance outshines his. Although Kutcher deserves some credit for trying to spread his professional wings it quickly becomes clear that hes in over his head. Fortunately for fans hes got other assets to fall back on. And theyre on ample display throughout.E.W.Ponyo 3 starsAnimated tale of a sea creature who loves a human. At area theaters (140). G. For all the magic of the Pixar era the poetry of beautiful hand-drawn animation never wavers. When not done assembly line-style it can still be transporting and ""Ponyo"" -- from Hayao Miyazaki (""Spirited Away"" ""Howls Moving Castle"") known as the Japanese Walt Disney -- is exactly that. An adaptation of Hans Christian Andersens ""The Little Mermaid"" that may confuse younger kids used to red-haired princesses Miyazakis film is a great way to show tweens something new.Here the fishy creature who falls for a human is cute little Ponyo the blobby spawn of a naval wizard (voiced by Liam Neeson) whose love is a brave 5-year-old boy. Trippy in the right way and wholly enchanting. J.N.Earth Days 3 starsDocumentary about the origins of Earth Day and the modern environmental movement. At the Quad (140). Not rated. A rich trove of news clips and interviews inform Robert Stones fast-moving documentary about the movement to save the planet and the cultural forces that helped it along or held it back.No ambiguity here and no back-and-forth about the causes of greenhouse gases; the emphasis is on awakening -- from the stupor of the 1950s through Rachel Carsons groundbreaking book ""Silent Spring"" to the burgeoning 70s science. Even with all the inconvenient truths exposed Stones film is still sadly inescapably crucial. J.N.

"The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-SalesmenMOVIE REVIEW The Goods Live Hard Sell HardThe Will Ferrell-Adam McKay production about used car salesmen is no comedy clunker.August 14 2009|Robert Abele It aint pretty to look at makes a lot of noise when it runs and has more than a few features that dont function but the car dealership comedy ""The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard"" has a beaters clunky fast-moving charm.Set in the world of crass battle-fatigued automobile salesmen and produced by the machismo-skewering team of Will Ferrell and Adam McKay (""Anchorman"" ""Talladega Nights"") it doesnt set out to be the raunchiest or silliest or dumbest movie youve ever seen. (It doesnt even qualify as the funniest comedy about used cars which is well that desperately venal 1980 model ""Used Cars."") But ""The Goods"" motors along choking out enough lowbrow laughs to make for an agreeably nutty late summer ride.Out front is ""Entourage"" dynamo Jeremy Piven -- more huckster than actor meaning perfectly cast -- as stripper-loving salesman-for-hire Don Ready a dealership-hopping mercenary hired by faltering lot owner Ben Selleck (James Brolin) to help unload more than 200 cars in one weekend before a competing businessman (Alan Thicke) can make good on his threat to take over. With a crack team -- played by the nimbly funny David Koechner Ving Rhames and Kathryn Hahn -- Pivens open-collared swaggering antihero sets out to move product reinforce tactical capitalisms ugly thrill and -- why not? -- try to seduce the owners daughter (Jordana Spiro) before she hitches herself to a boy-band-loving doofus (dim-bulb maestro Ed Helms).Writers Andy Stock and Rick Stempson and director Neal Brennan are hardly craftsmen -- the films visual appeal is that of a weather-stripped sedan -- but their greed for whiplash pacing brazen nastiness and unfettered lunacy (a hallmark of the Ferrell/McKay oeuvre) is refreshingly honest. Plus the cast is jammed with seasoned bit players -- Charles Napier Rob Riggle Craig Robinson Kristen Schaal -- who keep the party vibe going whether jokes fly or not.The best thing you could say about ""The Goods"" is that the filmmakers consider nothing and nobody terribly precious even their lead character. Chances are youll care more whether Hahns aggressively vixenish saleswoman follows through on an amusingly taboo scheme with Riggles hulking man-child than whether Don Ready can overcome his personal demons about true love deadbeat fatherhood and a departed ex-colleague (Ferrell in a choice cameo). Don even gets hilariously taken down at one point by a pair of heaven-sent angels who belt out his flaws as gospel truth. As absurdist touches go its worth shaking on.

Will Ferrell has specialized in such characters but its easy to see why he confined himself to producing and playing a three-scene cameo role in the scattershot ""The Goods"" with Piven uncomfortably cast in the role that Ferrell normally plays. Sure as hes shown on ""Entourage"" Piven can play a sleazeball with the best of them. But he just cant sell the characters reformation in this sporadically funny movie which -- like the worst of Ferrells -- is more often just plain stupid. Pivens character is summoned to run a no-holds-barred Fourth of July weekend clearance sale by James Brolin who is about to lose his California used-car dealership to the bank -- or perhaps rival dealer Alan Thicke. Our strip-club-lovin hero energizes Brolins haphazard staff in unconventional ways including unfortunately a racist beating of an Asian-American salesman (Ken Jeong) led by a demented old colleague (Charles Napier) who served in World War II. Pivens crack team includes fast-talking financial wiz David Koechner; Kathryn Hahn who spins lesbian fantasies for prospective male buyers when she isnt lusting after Brolins overly large 10-year-old son; and Ving Rhames as a sensitive retired pro bowler who has his own thing for a member of Brolins staff. Things start off well thanks to a series of inventive sales scams -- including a promised appearance by the brother of Bo Bice of ""American Idol."" But Piven himself is distracted by Brolins flirtatious daughter (Jordana Spiro) who is engaged to Thickes son (Ed Helms of ""The Office"") an aspiring boy-bander. ""Something is being taken away from me and I dont like it"" Pivens arrested-development case -- who may also have a long-lost son on Brolins staff -- whines at one point. Ferrell probably would have knocked that line out of the park. Instead Ferrell is literally accompanied by a heavenly choir. ""The Goods"" which shows signs of considerable tinkering in the editing room is understandably not getting a hard sell at all by its studio. THE GOODS LIVE HARD SELL HARD Die easy. Running time 91 minutes. Rated R (sex nudity profanity drugs). At the Empire the Chelsea others.

Never mind the self-deluded obliviousness exhibited by Ferrells dunderheaded Ricky Bobby and Ron Burgundy - they were harmless hapless essentially well-meaning guys.Jeremy Pivens Don Ready is another story. The Goods - from the same crowd that steered Talladega Nights and Anchor Man into theaters - trades in a similarly politically incorrect brand of comedy but theres nothing likable about the character. Don Ready is a fast-talking car salesman a hustler and a huckster who comes to Temecula Calif. to save Selleck Motors from bankruptcy.His goal move 211 cars over one Fourth of July weekend. His method anything that works.Piven carrying his first film after a long career of sideline schlumps and hard-case character parts (and of course Ari Gold in Entourage) has a nasty word for everybody. Don Readys smile is more like a sneer. Hes slick and ethically shabby and he has a posse of dubious cohorts played by Ving Rhames David Koechner and Kathryn Hahn.With James Brolin as the car lots eponymous (and closeted gay) proprietor and guest spots from anyone who did time on Jon Stewarts Daily Show The Goods is not without its share of laughs.But the laughs come with contempt and condescension not empathy.

Jennie Punter From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Aug. 13 2009 409PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 319PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard Directed by Neal Brennan Written Andy Stock and Rick Stempson Starring Jeremy Piven Ving Rhames James Brolin David Koechner Kathryn Hahn Jordana Spiro and Ed Helms Classification 14A Entourage s Jeremy Piven remains in hustler mode in The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard  a raunchy fast-paced comedy that nevertheless is as flat as the tires on the old Volvo gathering dust in my garage. Piven plays Don ""The Goods"" Ready a used-car ""mercenary"" who travels the U.S. Southwest with his crew of veteran hotshots liquidating sluggish lots for struggling dealerships by day and partying hard at night. When his services are called upon by Ben Selleck (James Brolin) whose Temecula Calif. dealership is facing bankruptcy on the eve of the July 4 weekend Don arrives more than ready to ""sell the metal."" But he doesnt expect that love loss and a long-lost son will speed him toward an emotional meltdown. The feature directorial debut of Chappelle Show co-creator Neal Brennan The Goods assembles a large cast of talented comic actors who make the most of their one-note roles. Dons crew includes Jibby (Ving Rhames) Babs (Kathryn Hahn) and Brent (David Koechner) all of whom deal with some kind of sexual ""issue"" during the long-weekend blitz. Brent becomes the immediate object of desire for Selleck a married man who is more than inching out of the closet. Babs develops a thing for Sellecks son Peter ( The Daily Show s tall and strapping Rob Riggle) a 10-year-old with a pituitary problem -a lame joke despite Riggles best efforts. And Jibby a particularly useless character for the most part just wants to ""make love to a woman"" for the first time (as opposed to having sex). Yee-awn. Ed Helms ( The Daily Show  The Office ) steals the movie in his supporting role as the smarmy Paxton the son of Stu Harding (the perfectly cast Alan Thicke) an imported car dealer who wants to buy Sellecks business. Paxton is also engaged to Sellecks cute smart daughter Ivy (Jordana Spiro) an annoying complication when Don becomes more than attracted to her. Ivy who is not completely immune to Dons sales-floor smarts is bent on finding out ""what happened in Querque"" (that is Albuquerque) a tragic recent event Dons crew keeps mentioning. Don finally relents and relates the story which features a surreal flashback cameo by Will Ferrell. And it is pretty bizarre. Ferrell (whose company produced The Goods ) plays a dim-witted but lovable DJ who jumps out of a plane as a stunt to help Don who it turns out handed his friend the wrong backpack. So we get to watch Ferrell dressed in an Uncle Sam costume falling through the air opening a pack filled with sex toys then deliver a truly odd stream-of-consciousness monologue. (He later appears as an angel to help out Don in mid-meltdown. But its not very funny.) The Goods suffers the same problem as so many other comedies made by TV folks It gets stuck in one place (the used car lot) and is primarily a series of sketches in this case not particularly successful ones. In the end this film is like a piano falling on a car - it may sound funny but not when it happens to you.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard Comedy. Starring Jeremy Piven Kathryn Hahn and James Brolin. Directed by Neal Brennan. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Something about ""The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard"" feels forgettable even though in the moment its often very funny. In a way its unfair to call a movie forgettable because about 80 percent of the movies we take seriously are probably also forgettable at least in the grand scheme. But this one feels forgettable today which makes it almost interesting - so forgettable its practically memorable. It stars Jeremy Piven as a wheeler-dealer freelance car salesman who comes to a small California city along with a crack team of associates to boost sales at a venerable dealership. The movie trades on the persona that Piven has built up over the past few years in feature films and in the HBO show ""Entourage"" of a blustering sell-snow-to-the-Eskimos fast talker who can say anything do anything and get away with everything. So the surprise here is that Piven is the movies weak link. Or maybe the weakness is in the role. In any case theres a big element of seductiveness missing in Don Ready (Piven) the central character and its clear from the first minutes. In an early scene he decides that he wants to smoke on an airplane. When a flight attendant warns him that thats illegal he launches into a defense of smoking and freedom thats intended to showcase his verbal flair and charm. But the speech impresses the people in the movie more than the people in the audience. It just doesnt dazzle. Aside from Don ""The Goods"" has some very good things about it It has a healthy streak of nastiness and its not afraid of absurdity. It goes for the jugular. If logic is in the way of a punch line goodbye logic. If a characters personality stands in the way of a laugh the personality is distorted. In another movie this might seem a form of laziness. Here its more like mischievousness and exuberance. Nobody on the other side of the camera is pretending that ""The Goods"" might be a classic. Like a crooked car dealer going after sales the filmmakers distort lie cheat inflate and exaggerate to get their laughs and most of the time they succeed. One funny running bit has James Brolin as the dealership owner making flirtatious sexual innuendoes in the direction of Brent (David Koechner) one of the salesmen. Nothing about the dealer reads gay and he has a wife and kids. The element is there just for the shock of the unexpected. In a similar spirit Kathryn Hahn as one of Dons sales agents keeps trying to seduce the dealers son. She knows the boy is only 10 years old but a genetic disorder gives him the body of a large 35-year-old man. So she doesnt care. Hahn played Milly the next-door neighbor in ""Revolutionary Road"" so it comes as a double surprise to see that she can be both funny and glamorous when she wants to be. The great virtue of ""The Goods"" - the thing that makes it hard to dismiss - is that it has a cast that really knows comedy. Brolin Hahn Koechner Rob Riggle (as the 10-year-old) Will Ferrell (in a cameo) and even Ving Rhames (also part of the sales team) find the right tone and they all have a light touch. Only Piven pushes and strains like someone with something to prove - and doesnt make the sale. -- Advisory Nudity strong language sexual situations. review Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 5 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 6 33 signs youre living in the San Francisco bubble 7 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 8 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 9 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 10 San Francisco ranks surprisingly low on the list of 20 Most...

"The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard Not worth buying | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Goods Live Hard Sell Hard Not worth buyingIts high noon in a used car lot - and this towns not big enough for the more than a dozen usually funny actors shoehorned into the spectacularly flat The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard .Jeremy Piven left helps clear James Brolins used-car lot.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Aug. 14 2009(out of 4)Starring Jeremy Piven Ving Rhames James Brolin David Koechner Kathryn Hahn and Ed Helms. 90 minutes. At major theatres. 18AIts high noon in a used car lot - and this towns not big enough for the more than a dozen usually funny actors shoehorned into the spectacularly flat The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard. Saddled with a ridiculously unwieldy title and a dumb script The Goods is a starring vehicle for Jeremy Piven who essentially reprises his reptilian character of L.A. agent Ari Gold from HBOs Entourage with a smattering of self-awareness tossed in.Article Continued BelowThe flick has the right cast to be a funny ride but instead suffers from a panicky sense of desperation to cram it all in while offending as many people as possible with lowball yuks.It has good genes the stamp of Adam McKay (Funnyordie.com Anchorman) and producing partner Will Ferrell who unfortunately decided to parlay his off-camera role into an uninspired bit part that relies on jokes about sex toys.The Goods is the handiwork of an untried team; the feature debut for director Neal Brennan (Chappelles Show) and writers Andy Stock and Rick Stempson whose previous credit is Balls Out Gary the Tennis Coach. Their inexperience shows.Piven plays Don ""The Goods"" Ready a used-car rainmaker leader of a pack of sleazy selling hotshots Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction) David Koechner (Anchorman) and Kathryn Hahn (Revolutionary Road). Shes especially good as the smoulderingly sexy Babs wholl do anything or anyone to make a sale. But the story line involving one of her conquests is just plain sick.Led by slick Don the gang goes from town to town riding in for a few days to clear car lots for a price when the regular staff cant deliver. Wearing a four-day growth of beard and dressed like a modern-day gunslinger in vest and sandwich-sized belt buckle Don never met a flight attendant he couldnt bed or a deal he couldnt close. Summoned by drowning-in-debt dealership owner Ben Selleck (James Brolin) to the town of Temecula Calif. to get rid of lingering inventory over the Fourth of July weekend the car wranglers arrive ready to do business.Selleck Motors sales staff - including earnest but useless Teddy Dang (The Hangovers Ken Jeong) and doddering old warmonger Dick Lewiston (Charles Napier) - are losers who need a lesson in inking the deal. Don also hopes to close one of his own luring Sellecks daughter Ivy (Jordana Spiro) with whom Piven has zero chemistry away from uptight fiance Paxton Harding (The Hangovers Ed Helms). Helms is a highlight in his usual role as the crown prince of dorks. This time hes the leader of the towns biggest boy band Big Ups. There are some laughs to be had but many of the jokes are stale and a look at the trailer gives most of them away. The Goods seems to rely on the weakest method of getting yuks if you cant write a gag that will make them howl swear.In this case the word is ""motherf-----."" And the dozens of times it is used - by everyone from a flight attendant to being sung by a chorus of angels - must break some kind of record. Its probably the only thing this one is remembered for.Maybe you can sell The Goods for parts but I aint buying.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

He and his ragtag team dive right in to save the day but what Ready doesnt count on is finding his soul. Starring Jeremy Piven Ving Rhames James Brolin David Koechner Kathryn Hahn Ed Helms Director Neal Brennan Running time 129  Editorial Review The Goods Kick the Tires And the WritersBy Ann HornadayWashington Post Staff WriterAugust 14 2009Theres surely no actor alive better suited to play the hustling slightly sleazy used car salesman at the center of ""The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard"" than Jeremy Piven. The sharp-tongued fireplug best known for playing the voracious talent agent Ari Gold on the HBO series ""Entourage"" seems plucked from some distant revival of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" with profanities and politically incorrect outrages at the ready.But in this sloppy compendium of filthy jokes and lowbrow sight gags the vulgar arias of David Mamet have been replaced with the preoccupations of its producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay. Granted theyve been responsible for some of the most satisfying smart-stupid comedies in recent years including ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights."" There are laughs to be had in ""The Goods"" which features Ferrell himself in two of the funniest scenes. But most often theyre cheap and easy delivered with such crude attempts at shock value that they cant be repeated in a family newspaper.Piven plays Don Ready an itinerant car salesman who leads a team of fellow mercenaries throughout the American West parachuting in when a dealership is in trouble. Hes been called to a dusty California town by Ben Selleck (James Brolin) who must have a strong Fourth of July weekend or lose his business forever. With his ragtag group of foulmouthed fellow mercenaries (played by Ving Rhames Kathryn Hahn and David Koechner) Don descends on Sellecks lot with a pocketful of gimmicks including a DJ strippers to greet the customers and plenty of red white and blue bunting. Soon his prime motivation becomes impressing Sellecks comely blonde daughter Ivy (Jordana Spiro) who makes him reconsider his boot-heels-must-be-wandering ways.Selleck brings his own squad of misfits to the fray At one point a Korean salesman played by Ken Jeong is set upon by colleagues in a fit of pique over Pearl Harbor. Theyre egged on by a coke-snorting obscenity-spewing veteran played by the squared-jawed character actor Charles Napier.Rooting for all of them to fail is Ivys dweeb of a fiance Paxton (Ed Helms) who sells foreign cars and leads a superannuated boy band called Big Ups. Watching Helms mug it up as an aging wannabe pop star in ""The Goods"" serves as an unlikely reminder of why ""The Hangover"" a similarly raunchy but much better comedy in which he also co-starred has become one of this summers surprise hits. Where ""The Hangover"" had its share of ebbs and dead spots it still managed to hum along at an easy increasingly madcap clip. ""The Goods"" which was written by Andy Stock and Rick Stempson and directed by Neal Brennan (""Half Baked"") barely makes it to the finish line wheezing and sputtering like one of Sellecks clunkers.As it lurches from set piece to set piece ""The Goods"" begins to take on the very sense of con artistry that Ready personifies. Its as if the filmmakers assured of an audience parched for laughs in the dog days of August figure its enough to throw them running gags involving Brolin and his characters gay proclivities and the seduction of a 10-year-old boy in a 30-year-olds body (played by Rob Riggle) broken up with rote profanity. The audience will no doubt laugh on cue as ""The Goods"" hits its marks with dutiful predictability but they shouldnt be surprised if they come to feel like theyve been had.Contains sexual content nudity pervasive profanity and some drug material.

Theater Edina. ""Adam"" is a minor tolerably enjoyable romance that doesnt add up to anything much. Dimple-licious Rose Byrne rebounding from a bad breakup moves into a Manhattan brownstone and meets her diffident neighbor Hugh Dancy. She first takes him for a socially awkward schlemiel but learns that he has Aspergers Syndrome a mild form of autism. Hes highly intelligent but given to blunt honesty. Byrne falls for his childlike innocence because shes an elementary school teacher. Figuring that he just has a tougher than usual case of ""nobody understands me"" Byrne leads him into an affair. But when Dancy asks her father Peter Gallagher what it feels like to be under indictment for felony accounting fraud its easy to see this will not be a smooth courtship. The film earnestly informs us about Dancys condition as if the film was an After School Special. I learned that his condition makes you alternately cuddly-zany (he washes Byrnes windows dangling from a rope while wearing a full astronaut suit) and violent (wall mirrors and flowerpots beware). I also learned that a beautiful 30-something in New York City cant be choosy. COLIN COVERT THE GOODS  out of four stars Rating R for sexual content nudity language drug material. If there were a cash for clunkers program for ramshackle film vehicles ""The Goods"" would command a premium price. This lowbrow car-lot comedy wheezes and sputters clunks and groans but never makes it into second gear. The movie the first entirely produced by Will Ferrells new studio Gary Sanchez Productions is a sad debut. Neal Brennan co-creator of TVs ""Chappelles Show"" makes his directing debut capturing all of the beloved comedy series raunch and none of its wit. Jeremy Piven stars ... sigh. Just typing that hurts. Piven plays a motor-mouthed used-car salesman brought in to save a failing dealership. Unless every auto on the crowded lot is sold in three days owner James Brolin will go bankrupt. Pivens character a strutting flimflam artist quarterbacks the sales team teaching them inventive techniques to defraud the public. The story makes Pivens huckster a sort of hero by positioning him as the underdog fighting against a rival BMW dealership and by making him good at his trade. How good? Good enough to buy a car wait 20 minutes and sell it back to the original owner at a profit. But his greasy charisma quickly wears thin and a romantic subplot pairing him with attractive Jordana Spiro pushes the story toward sheer fantasy. The movie gores many sacred cows insulting families capitalism sexual responsibility political correctness and smoking bans with glee if not originality. Ferrell pops in for an absurd extended cameo that echoes the premise of the film When your crew isnt getting the job done bring in a pro. But even his frenzied efforts arent enough to make the sale. COLIN COVERT NOT QUITE HOLLYWOOD  out of four stars Rating R for nudity sexuality violence gore language drug use. Theater Lagoon. Quentin Tarantino is on hand to give his benediction to the films featured in ""Not Quite Hollywood"" a compilation/celebration of ludicrous Australian exploitation movies. His tribute to obscure drive-in fare from Outback auteurs is a kick -- say what you will QT can talk. The film assembles filmmakers to reminisce about working unsavory edges of the New Australian Cinema in the 1970s. While their more elitist compatriots were making ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" and ""My Brilliant Career"" they were grinding out sleazy sex comedies disreputable ""documentaries"" (one moviemaker staged a satanic mass in his mother-in-laws back yard) and blood-on-the-lens actioners. Alas most of the films glimpsed here look like theyre more fun to summarize than to view. Tarantinos enthusiasm notwithstanding backstage gossip about movies of no importance is enough to bore even certified film geeks. There is one anecdote worth repeating. Dennis Hopper imported to star in a Down Under western got into character by downing enough 151 rum to pickle a whale. His Aborigine co-star fled the set to talk to nature spirits about Hoppers erratic behavior. ""They said Dennis is crazy"" he reported. The producer replied ""I could have told you that.""

Jeremy Pivens much-admired performance as a live-wire agent in ""Entourage"" gets a grueling road test in ""The Goods Live Hard  Sell Hard"" inasmuch as he plays virtually the same motor-mouthed character for a duration equivalent to three teeth-grinding episodes. A project about selling used cars invites abuse but the movie indeed runs out of gas squandering a wealth of comedy talent mostly associated with television. Barely mustering enough crude humor for one trailer ""The Goods"" continues a ""lost"" (as in ""Land of the"") summer for Will Ferrells producing endeavors; Paramount doesnt figure to yield much cash from this clunker. The premise proves so wispy that director Neal Brennan (""Chappelles Show"") has to rely on several musical montages to pad the story to feature length. The sputtering plot focuses on Don Ready (Piven) and his trio of ""mercenary"" car salesmen enlisted to save a struggling franchise in the nondescript California town of Temecula. The dealership is owned by stately ol Ben Selleck (James Brolin) who spends most of the movie propositioning Dons balding sidekick Brent (David Koechner). In fact the whole Selleck family quickly finds itself in strange liaisons with Dons neer-do-wells Don flirts with Bens engaged daughter Ivy (Jordana Spiro ""My Boys"") while the one gal in Dons quartet Babs (Kathryn Hahn) fixates on Bens son (Rob Riggle) a man-sized 10-year-old thanks to a pituitary condition. And so it goes. Ving Rhames rounds out Dons posse getting some laughs simply because of the low rumble in his voice. Ivy has an odious fiance (Ed Helms in what surely wont be his highest-grossing comedy of 2009) who with his import-selling dad (Alan Thicke) wants to take over Sellecks business. Bankruptcy looms unless Don can move all 211 cars off the lot in one weekend. Or something like that. Earning its R rating for salty language (""mother"" is frequently invoked but almost always with a tart chaser) the movie inadvertently telegraphs its strategic approach near the outset when Don tells the standoffish Ivy that hes ""just gonna keep firing til I hit something."" As much could be said for Brennan who betrays his sketch-comedy roots working from a scattershot script by Andy Stock and Rick Stempson. Yet despite the casts gameness and a few uncredited cameos funny people saying filthy things only goes so far. And even playing with obvious cliches the lets-save-(closeted)-dads-dealership motif feels like the flimsiest of excuses to allow Piven to chew through the drab scenery. Frankly the movie gets its best comedic mileage from character actor Charles Napier as a bigoted easily riled war vet. Of course seeing cars sell like hotcakes given the auto industrys well-publicized woes represents its own kind of dark joke but a movie that spends half its time in strip clubs because what the hell weve got an R already for dialogue cant really be expected to indulge in social commentary. At least ""The Goods"" knows precisely what its mission is. But unlike Dons can-do attitude the movie simply doesnt deliver -- living hard selling hard and before its over finally dying hard.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard the feature directorial debut of Chappelles Show co-creator Neal Brennan casts Jeremy Piven as the head of a traveling crew of used-car salespeople. Mercenaries of the trade they travel from town to town helping dealers clear their lots using whatever sleazy means they deem necessary to make a sale. Then they pack their bags and move on leaving a lot of unsatisfied customers in their wake. By the films final scene the plot has started to feel self-referential. Piven leads an ensemble cast of funny people--David Koechner Rob Riggle and Tony Hale tip an iceberg that also includes Kristen Schaal Ed Helms and others--shuffling through a largely laugh-free wasteland of easy setups easier punchlines and endless repetition. (Even those amused by the first scene in which James Brolins car-lot patriarch puts the moves on Koechner will probably have tired of the joke by the fifth go-around.) Brennan opens the film on a promisingly timely note with footage of Brolins declining business synched to Loretta Lynns despairing ""May God Bless America Again."" But The Goods is really about Pivens character leading a charge for a return to the old-fashioned values of lap dances hard booze and easy money. (Its almost as if he spent his formative years rebelling against some kind of PCU.) About Piven When did it go wrong? When did the caustic character actor guaranteed to liven up even the dullest movie turn into a walking black hole of smarm from which no joy can escape? Pivens frat-boy-with-suspicious-looking-hairline act is front and center here which demands a lot of tolerance from the audience. But the script and Brennans lay-it-on-with-a-trowel approach to comedy is what ultimately kills the movie. Funny ideas bubble up from time to time--Helms boy-band-for-thirtysomethings Big Ups Craig Robinson as a character named DJ Request whos fiercely opposed to taking requests--only to disappear into a morass of stripper jokes and desperation. When producer Will Ferrell shows up for a cameo involving a skydiving accident a Lincoln costume and a sex toy The Goods seems on the verge of redefining the phrase ""anything for a laugh."" Or it would if there were any laughs involved.

Besides that bit of OMG hysteria Todd Graffs film is written with a desperate cleverness that clamors for attention over the brainless against-the-odds music-competition plot. Chinless new kid Will (Gaelan Connell) finds his encyclopedic audiophilia pressed into service when nervy Charlotte (singer Aly Michalka) wants to enter her garage trio in a regional battle of the bands. He also finds a partner in crime in sarcastic outsider ""Sa5m"" (played by HSMer Vanessa Hudgens) while his long-necked and fretful mom (Lisa Kudrow) hovers. Thus Will achieves the bizarre dream of becoming a band manager in a story littered with musical references (Bowie CBGB) that are more 50-year-old screenwriter than platinum teenybopper. The fleeting first kiss between Will and Sa5m is the rare sweet moment on the trudge toward the big night when a tinny lineup of finalists in various ersatz styles climaxes with Wills nine-piece band -- actually called ""I Cant Go On Ill Go On."" (Citywide) (Nicolas Rapold) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - GO  FLAME amp; CITRON Of all European nations Denmark enjoys the nearest thing to a heroic record of resisting the Nazi occupiers -- which adds both poignancy and punch to Ole Christian Madsens fact-based drama about two posthumously honored Danes. Framed without cynicism as a gangster picture (the point being that contract killing turns everyone into a thug however noble the cause) this slickly produced picture stars the almost unbearably charismatic Thure Lindhardt and the saturnine Mads Mikkelson as co-assassins -- one loves killing the other makes a mess of everything but killing -- charged with executing Denmarks Nazi collaborators. Flame amp; Citron is less about the battle between good and evil than about losing ones way in the fog of war which makes it hard to tell friend from foe and harder yet to sort through the rules of engagement and complicates the heroic honor codes of movies about the ""good war."" Jean-Pierre Melvilles 1969 masterpiece Army of Shadows exerts a palpable influence but in its own right Flame amp; Citron is the film that the horribly overrated Black Book could have been had Paul Verhoeven not indulged in the puerile reversals of sensitive Nazis and treacherous partisans. (Royal; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Ella Taylor)G.I. JOE THE RISE OF COBRA Credited as the first ""action figure"" G.I. Joe came to life in 1964 as Hasbros answer to Mattels Barbie doll. There were actually four Joes -- one for each branch of the armed forces -- and in the imaginations of boys everywhere they fought Nazis. Forty-odd years later the Joes have evolved into an international band of soldiers seeking to bring down the evil Cobra Command. In the first of whats likely to be a lucrative new film series director Stephen Sommers (The Mummy Van Helsing) outfits actors Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans in ""accelerator suits"" which allow them to jump cars and buses in a single bound as they and their team attempt to retrieve a suitcase containing nano technology that a lunatic billionaire (Christopher Eccleston) plans to use for world domination. After a first hour that plays like a bad TV show Sommers hits his groove with an over-the-top Paris chase sequence which in turn leads to an underwater finale thats absurdly overproduced momentarily diverting and then instantly forgettable. The script -- by Stuart Beattie David Elliot and Paul Lovett -- is full of embarrassingly bad dialogue but a recent midnight screening audience laughed benignly as if to say that they hadnt exactly been expecting profundity and wit from a summer-season toy-soldier flick. (Citywide) (Chuck Wilson)THE GOODS LIVE HARD SELL HARD Making copy editors lives everywhere easier The Goods doesnt deliver. Don Ready (Jeremy Piven not changing a note from Entourage) is a hired-gun slasher salesman the guy you call when your used-car business is in trouble. With his team Dons a genius at clearing out stagnant lots. Producers Adam McKay and Will Ferrell are firmly in Anchorman territory which means theres zero time wasted on token sentiment. They also miss a chance to immerse themselves in a potentially rich environment shown in all its gimmicky grandeur in John Landis underrated used-car-salesman documentary Slasher. Nothing here convinces. Briskly vulgar The Goods skips scatalogy and goes straight for the gonads ""I have hair on my balls and I sell cars"" is how Ready introduces himself. Compared to 2009s truly vile specimens (like Miss March) The Goods is unobjectionable but shoddy. The few real laughs -- all two minutes worth -- come courtesy of Russ Meyer veteran Charles Napier as Dick Lewiston the angriest macho male anachronism of the year. ""I dont like Jews queers or Eskimos"" he announces apropos of nothing. ""I was raised that way."" Napier connects the dots between economic disenfranchisement and subversive humor; the rest of it is just a bunch of absurdist dick jokes.

Sep. 13 600pm GRACE A muddled logic-starved provocation Grace avoids smugness by refusing to play its body horror for shits and giggles but its resonance is purely atmospheric. Miscarriage-plagued Madeline (Jordan Ladd) decides to carry her latest child to term after losing it during a car accident that also kills her dullard of a husband who goes bizarrely unmissed even by his own mother. Through sheer determination (a.k.a. screenwriter contrivance) Madeline wills her baby to life except little should-be-stillborn Grace who transforms mommys breasts into a bloody war zone after only a few feedings appears to be only half-alive given her low temperature putrid body odor and kinship to flies. Soon -- perhaps naturally -- the blood from organic supermarket meat (and from a surgeon who pays house calls) ends up in the tykes glass bottles after the hospital-averse Madeline diagnoses as being protein-deprived. Creepy yes but whats the point of all of this bratty poignance-free bloodletting? If the references to Madelines past sex life and finicky diet are any indication perhaps writer-director Paul Solets only point is to warn us of the dangers of lesbian vegans aiming their breasts at the mouths of babes. (Sunset 5) (Ed Gonzalez)I SELL THE DEAD Hours from the chopping block apprentice grave robber Arthur (Dominic Monaghan) recounts his small-hour scrapes with ghouls and ruffians to Ron Perlmans priest. The storytelling frame allows a genial aint-it-cool pileup of occasionally antic episodes most of which build to Arthur and his partner Willies glorified shock takes at frisky impeccably made-up undead. The film is set in the feckin 19th century and buffered by raise-your-flagon pub scenes (apparently shot in the East Village at the Scratcher) and the setup is like snack food for horror hobbyists -- Angus Scrimm turns up and (producer) Larry Fessenden plays old hand Willie. Its rather hard for anyone who has ever chanced upon a Poe anthology on cable and only lasted through one or two cheeky tales. First-time director Glenn McQuaid is especially enthusiastic about the duos rivals (a Burtonesque family of rogues dubbed ""The House of Murphy"") but the editing rushes through the best bits and trips up Arthur and Willies partnership. Supporting hobbit turned Lost axiom Monaghan is too reserved anyway and even Fessenden holds back from hork-in-yer-top-hat unsavoriness. Though Arthurs brassy wench Maisey (Eileen Colgan) enters too late to turn things around she gets the best introduction fresh off a career in ""wrecking"" ships siren-style for their booty. (Sunset 5) (Nicolas Rapold)GO  IT MIGHT GET LOUD Marketed as a guitar summit between the Edge Jimmy Page and Jack White Davis Guggenheims affectionate intermittently insightful behind-the-music doc is more electric triptych than meeting of the minds. Yes the trio gather round the sound-stage amps to teach each other a few tricks but its anticlimactic -- save for the schoolboy smiles of White and the Edges mug when Page instructs them in the finer art of piloting a Led Zeppelin. But the meat of the movie deals with their individual tales anyway the Edge showing off the school rooms and studios where U2 became one; Page air-guitaring along to Link Wrays ""Rumble"" and guiding us through the manse where the fourth Zep record was recorded; White building a guitar out of little more than wood wire and a Coke bottle. Guggenheim pits youngun against old fart White bemoans ""technology"" while the Edge is nothing but -- so much so that U2 fans may find themselves disappointed by the revelation that the Wizard is nothing but a pile of pedals behind that arena-sized curtain. Its Page a joyful instructor and natural storyteller who steals the spotlight. (Robert who? More please.) Only real complaint The movies not loud enough. They should have turned that fucker up to 11. (The Landmark; ArcLight Hollywood; Playhouse 7; Town Center 5) (Robert Wilonsky)SPREAD Broke-ass hustler Nikki (Ashton Kutcher who also produced) may not have a home or a car but he does possess ""six inches and a pretty face"" in the words of his latest conquest Samantha (Anne Heche) a 40-ish corporate lawyer with a fantastic house in the Hollywood Hills. Director David Mackenzie best known for 2003s coitus-heavy Young Adam and first-time screenwriter Jason Hall make sure Nikkis half-footer services Samantha (before she has vaginal-rejuvenation surgery) in many different positions on several pieces of furniture -- scenes that generate about as much heat as reading Alex Witchels recent obsessive recapitulation of Heche getting her hair and makeup done in The New York Times Magazine. Nikki like fellow L.A. opportunist Joe Gillis in Sunset Boulevard provides first-person voice-over with Kutchers drone registering as neither sardonic send-up nor consistently fanged takedown of Lotusland. Instead as Nikki falls for Heather (Margarita Levieva) a player herself Spread becomes a sloggy tepid comeuppance tale. Though the end credits feature an inspired bit of nastiness Spread might best be remembered for Nikkis horrible kept-man fashion sense His keffiyeh and skinhead suspenders are a far cry from Richard Geres Armani suits in American Gigolo -- and Joe Dallesandros skin-hugging raglan T-shirts and polyester pants in Heat. (AMC Burbank Town Center 6 Mann Chinese 6 Mann Criterion 6) (Melissa Anderson) GO  TAXIDERMIA A batshit-crazy whatsit that applies a dazzling visual vocabulary to gleefully crass buffoonery Taxidermia suggests a Jackass flick as directed by Swedens Roy Andersson. The stoners fantasy of non sequiturs and carnivalesque body horrors begins almost sensibly with a possibly retarded army dude singeing the hairs on his body then shooting flames from his cock -- a phantasmagoric expression of the lengths to which bored stiffs will go in order to get off. The dimwitted perv will go out with an unexpected bang but not before slipping his dick into a freezing tub of water a makeshift vagina carved into the side of his cabin and a portly tease who will give birth to his son a future giant literally of the speed-eating world. The tableaux depicting the pathetic single-minded lives of father son and finally sickly taxidermist grandson are insanely stitched together with highly conceptual graphics and director Gyorgy Palfis vision includes a 360-degree pan around a vomit trough and the conflation of an orgasm to the killing of a pig. All this helps to shape Palfis crudely bombastic but impressive philosophical view of the body as landscape and art a source of personal discovery wonder and annihilation. (Nuart) (Ed Gonzalez)THE TIME TRAVELERS WIFE A dapper (mostly) contemporary costume drama The Time Travelers Wife is abundantly interior-decorated in vintage rococo. Eric Bana to his credit continues to wear the outfits picked out for him remarkably well. The hip-bougie upholstery even covers the band at the fairy-tale wedding playing ""Love Will Tear Us Apart."" Its not really love though that complicates things between Clare (Rachel McAdams) and Henry (Bana) but instead Henrys tendency to inconveniently melt in and out of the present finding himself unceremoniously stranded somewhere in time naked. The ""absentee time-traveling partner"" is an open invitation to apply your own metaphor -- I favor a time-travel-equals-chronic-blackout-drinking reading but its elastic enough for whatever. Wife recalls a few other timeline-tangled romances not least the telescoped lifelong love of 1948s Portrait of Jennie -- but where Jennie favored a ""poetic"" logic (and no-strings-attached romance) Wife forgoes any sense of mystery dealing in the daily difficulties of synchronizing schedules doctors appointments vasectomies pregnancies and meeting friends and parents (all crowding the movie and further diluting the already-limited rapport of the central lovers). This thoroughness may impress fans of the bestseller source novel but will disappoint anyone looking for transport from a movie. Being a time travelers wife it turns out is mostly a drag.

Its the execution thats out of alignment in The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard a slightly dinged endeavor from the makers of Talladega Nights Barely controlled scenes of genial scattershot political incorrectness (sexual racial you name it) bump up awkwardly against a soft sad story of economic downturn. Ed Helms and Ving Rhames score laughs. But the breakout is Step Brothers Kathryn Hahn as the tough (sales)girl who keeps up with the boys.

Sell Hard"" must have believed that someone somewhere would think repeatedly referring to Albuquerque as "" querque"" is funny. The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard Bomb Director Neal Brennan. Cast Jeremy Piven Ving Rhames Ed Helms. Rating Rated R for sexual content nudity pervasive language and some drug material. Related Jeremy Piven leaves his entourage behind for a lead role Thats not the greatest sin the makers of this wretched mean-spirited little waste of talent have committed. Just one. But if you find such a person one who might enjoy that kind of thing by all means buy him a ticket. Maybe hell enjoy ""The Goods."" Its hard to believe anyone else would. Its an unconscionable waste of talent an immediate embarrassment for Jeremy Piven Ving Rhames David Koechner Ed Helms and Tony Hale. Who knows how much they got paid but if it wasnt a lot they were robbed. Then again so is the audience. Piven plays a used-car salesman - like much of the movie it sounds like a great idea on paper - who is a hired gun. Desperate dealerships call him and his team to help them move cars. The dealer in question this time around is Ben Selleck (James Brolin) whose family dealership in Temecula Calif. is in danger of going under. He reluctantly calls Don Ready (Piven) for help over a Fourth of July weekend; next thing you know Ready and his crew - Jibby (Rhames) Brent (David Koechner) and Babs (Kathryn Hahn) - hit town and start selling cars. Among the developments once there Selleck has the hots for Brent; Babs has the hots for Brents 10-year-old son who thanks to some medical condition or other looks like a 30-year-old man (or like Rob Riggle); and Ready falls for Sellecks daughter Ivy (Jordana Spiro). Shes engaged to Paxton Harding (Helms) who works at the rival dealership his father (Alan Thicke) owns but dreams of making it big with his adult boy band. (Again potentially hilarious idea cruelly mistreated.) Ready seems to love his life but the team repeatedly makes reference to what happened in "" querque"" and how it affected him. It involves a parachute and a silly appearance by Will Ferrell one of the films producers but trust me by that point you wont care. Are there any laughs? Sure some funny lines sneak through. Whats the saying about the blind pig occasionally finding an acorn? Its bewildering. These are funny people - director Neal Brennan co-created ""Chappelles Show."" And its not as if small gritty gleefully profane films cant work (see ""The Foot Fist Way"" or even more appropriately the great ""Used Cars""). This one just doesnt. Not in querque or anywhere else.

"movie review the goods live hard sell hard the goods live hard sell hard movie review movie review the goods live hard sell hard the goods live hard sell hard movie review movie review the go - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard -- 2 out of 5 stars Ed Helms Alan Thicke James Brolin and Jeremy Piven Paramount Paramount Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Hollywoods ""Cash for Clunkers"" program misfires with The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard. Its a car-selling comedy that plays like a backfiring Bentley -- a shiny ride that runs in fits and starts never quite hitting on all cylinders.The Goods is a Jeremy Piven vehicle his first big-screen headliner since what P.C.U.? But the Entourage agent doesnt bring his A game making his swaggering fast-talking salesman Don Ready not quite ready for the spotlight. Its not all his fault. A cast of Hangover comics and folks from the Will Ferrell stable manage some giggles. But this short movie plays looong thanks to slow-footed direction and editing that doesnt hide the dead spaces between the yuks. Ready heads a rootless amoral team of ""move the metal"" mercenaries supersalesfolk who show up at troubled dealerships and clear the lot with their hustle. On that team -- the silky-droll Jibby ( Ving Rhames) the saucy Babs (Kathryn Hahn of Step Brothers) and Brent ""Magic"" Gage the accountant (David Koechner). They live in budget hotels dine in strip joints (funniest lap-dance scene ever) and jet from city to city ""saving"" embattled dealerships.James Brolin is the Temecula Calif. dealer who summons them with Ken Jeong ( The Hangover) and Charles Napier among his hapless salesmen and Jordana Spiro as his daughter who is engaged to the dweeb son (Ed Helms of The Hangover) of a competitor ( Alan Thicke). Craig Robinson ( Pineapple Express) a strip joint DJ will play the tunes that lure the customers. Many players make an impression -- Napiers racist WWII vet salesman for instance. Helms fiance has delusions of boy band (""MAN band"") fame through his group Big Ups.""We opened for O-Town. You can Google it""But for a movie thats going for the down and dirty this one seems lost on the lot. How do they lure and lie to the customers how do they stay so amped up during marathon sales and all-night parties? This film of Hangover refugees plays like a PG Hangover.The funny people in front of the camera (Ferrell has a tasty cameo) suggest that the real lemons on this lot are behind the camera. Director Neal Brennan (Chapelles Show) and the screenwriters have a showroom cast and a movie with nothing under the hood.
