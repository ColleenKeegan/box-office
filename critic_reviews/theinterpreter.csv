One evening shes working late and overhears a sinister conversation filtering through the main chambers microphone system theres a plot afoot to assassinate Edmund Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) the reviled president of  the African state of Matobo who is due to make a controversial visit to the UN within days...Who you gonna call? Enter the Secret Service and hard-boiled recently bereaved special agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) a man who wears conspicuous dark glasses and has a sign on his desk that reads Secret Agent. Is Broome - who is herself Matoban speaks the native Ku language and harbours a radical political past - telling the truth? And what about exiled Matoban dissident Kuman-Kuman (George Harris) who now lives in Brooklyn? Whats he up to? Its time both for Broome to enjoy round-the-clock protection and for director Sydney Pollack to indulge in the internal machinery of the UN building (allowing in movie cameras for the first time) and some impressive helicopter shots of NYC.Matobo? Ku? Kuman-Kuman? All fictional of course - but we must assume that Matobo is a post-revolutionary now corrupt sub-Saharan state along the lines of say Zimbabwe and in turn that President Zuwanie is a thinly veiled portrait of a Robert Mugabe-type figure. This is largely a competent successful  thriller but observing global politics from this perspective is an uncomfortable frustrating experience. The world-view on display here is much more considered than say in a Bond movie but the film still lends nothing to our understanding of postcolonial Africa or the UN (discounting the decor of its more private corners). And as for the will-they/wont-they chemistry between Broome and Keller...

The threat has come to light from an overheard conversation. In the big room by chance one night U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) catches some muttered words in Ku the language of Matobo which she understands so well. Nicole Kidman as U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome and Sean Penn as federal agent Tobin Keller fail to really engage the viewer in ""The Interpreter.""

Born and raised in the (fictional) southern African nation shes uniquely qualified to appreciate the severity of the remark. ""Teacher"" is the nickname for Edmund Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) the president of Matobo who has been under international pressure to curb his draconian reprisals against political enemies. Zuwanie who has demanded to address the United Nations  is in danger. So is Silvia for knowing about the threat. But when she contacts the U.S. Secret Service Silvia is surprised to find herself the target of suspicion by agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) the man in charge of investigating her report. ""The Interpreter"" directed by Sydney Pollack who made 1975s ""Three Days of the Condor"" has the nail-biting allure of an old-fashioned thriller. With scenes in the United Nations -- this is the first time a Hollywood production has been granted access to film there -- it also has smatterings of Alfred Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest"" a thriller also set in and around the United Nations. (Hitchcock had to build his own U.N. set.) Theres a hint too of ""The Manchurian Candidate"" a film about a hypnotically controlled assassin. As a straight-ahead thriller the movie is enjoyable and stirring much of the time. And there is one tense sequence involving a city bus thats the standout set piece of the film. But ""The Interpreter"" fails to get much traction in the character department. Although Kidmans Down Under tongue makes for a convincing white southern African accent she seems rather schematically conceived a multilingual quasi-superheroine and sophisticate with radical connections to (and formulaically traumatic memories of) Matobos revolutionary days. And Penns Tobin who also carries around his own formulaic mental baggage makes an interesting but not emotionally involving foil. Tobins obsession that theres more to Silvia than meets the eye yields fascinating revelations but its not enough to burnish the film in your heart or memory. As for their growing romantic tension the apparent meat and potatoes of the movie it could use a little more salt and pepper. Theres at least one other problem. Silvias the passionate citizen of a fictional African country in an otherwise realistic setting -- the world of interpreters at the United Nations. Theres a disconnect between the gravity of the situation and a make-believe nation Somewhere in Africa. Should we really be worried that some leader from a made-up country might die? Pollacks ""Three Days of the Condor"" which starred Robert Redford and Max von Sydow had a greater sense of menace because it felt more rooted in actuality the possibility of a vengeful CIA using all its power to kill a loose whistleblower. Although watchable ""The Interpreter"" is a convoluted yarn that trades on well-executed suspense tactics but not its people. You watch ""Condor"" and you never forget von Sydow and Redford. See ""The Interpreter"" and chances are youll only recall Kidmans face. And that bus scene. ""Condor"" will endure; it already has. ""The Interpreter"" simply wont.

Its ambition is admirable It wants to be an adult thriller like its directors justly famous ""Three Days of the Condor"" with political and psychological reverberations on real-world topics with a reasonable cause-effect dynamic at play clear motives action plausible and not overdone free of computer effects full of recognizable compellingly flawed characters yet taut and gripping to an astonishing end. Alas as someone has said theres many a slip twixt the cup and the lip and ""The Interpreter"" slips like a drunk on a greasy playground slide in a high wind. Youre left with admirable even noble wreckage but wreckage it is. Nicole Kidman plays a U.N. translator who overhears a plot to assassinate an African leader in Sydney Pollacks film that strains to match his ""Three Days of the Condor."" (Phil Bray -- Universal Studios Via AP) _____More in Movies_____  The Interpreter National Showtimes  Watch the Trailer  More Movie Trailers  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now The grand old director Sydney Pollack (besides ""Condor"" he made ""The Yakuza"" ""Out of Africa"" and ""They Shoot Horses Dont They?"" among other distinguished efforts) plays with a situation that seems promising. An interpreter at the United Nations -- one of those linguistic geniuses who can make instantaneous real-time translation and thereby lubricate the wheels of diplomacy -- overhears a conversation in an arcane African language one night when shes come back to her booth overlooking the General Assembly. As it happens shes one of six people in the West who understand the language and what she hears seems to suggest that the controversial leader of a small country may be assassinated during a scheduled speech before the assembly in the next week. This is classic Hitchcock setup a woman who knows too much and suddenly finds herself heading north by northwest as various mysterious antagonists begin to threaten and shadow her and her ""protector"" an American Secret Service agent is ambivalent toward her. The woman -- Silvia Broome -- is very well played by Nicole Kidman who refuses to coast on her beauty and instead as the film progresses reveals a tormented personality and a contact to that country that brings her testimony into question. One problem We see her overhear the threat so we know its legitimate. But Our Hero doesnt. As a suspense ploy this is a mistake because the already crowded plot wastes too much time proving what we already know to be true. But its not the big one. The big one is casting Sean Penn as Secret Service agent Tobin Keller. It just so happens that Ive spent the last two years on a project involving an episode from Secret Service history and as a consequence have met a fair number of agents. That makes me no expert at all but I can say Better men youve never met. These guys are like 50s ballplayers square-jawed modest forthright with their short trimmed hair direct gazes and muscular vital bodies. Theyre the guy youd want in the foxhole with you except theyd be the sarge or the lieutenant already. And then theres Penn. Did he do no research? Was he too selfish to even look at the type of man he was portraying? Did he notice nothing pick up cues on anything? Agh the hair is too long by several inches the drinking habits (a slug every few minutes) out of control but worst of all is his face. The badge of honor and price of admission into this culture is that professional mug Among special agents of the U.S. Secret Service the expressions run the gamut from A to A-minus expressing at one end of the spectrum polite interest and far away at the other end mildly polite interest. By contrast Penns face is his instrument. For him ""acting"" is basically an issue of manipulating his face. Mobile tormented expressive with welling tears or scowling mouth or brows raised in operatic astonishment it dominates the movie in unpleasant increasingly incredible ways making the actor seem as if hes wandered in from ""Days of Our Lives"" or a high school production of ""Hedda Gabler"" in which he had the title role. Could he not discipline himself along more realistic lines? Its so stupid and youd think that a pro like Pollack would get it. Hes a superb director of actors and hes worked before with high-achieving minimalists like Robert Redford and Robert Mitchum. Thats what this part needed not a grief-merchant tear-jerker By contrast the very fine character actor Catherine Keener is excellent as his no-nonsense partner shes every inch the believable special agent controlled efficient dedicated human but highly disciplined (as was come to think of it Clint Eastwood in the far superior Secret Service drama ""In the Line of Fire""). The story follows three lines simultaneously Kellers investigation of Silvia Silvias slowly revealed engagement in Africa and Keller and Silvias growing trust and eventual love. It is less interested in but doesnt abandon completely the more conventional thriller hugger-mugger following the mysterious-assassin pattern also finding time to stalk various murderous ploys and counterploys in a riven emigre community even while the dangerous arrival of the political leader to the U.N. draws closer and closer. The best thing in the film after Keener is Africa. Pollack after ""Out of Africa"" is an old hand and here you find his imagination fully engaged as he beautifully evokes a cry for the beloved country. The fictitious nation seems to be modeled on what was once called Rhodesia and now Zimbabwe one with a long-entrenched white colonial class a civil war a ""liberator"" turned genocidalist and 12-year-old boy soldiers with AK-47s. It turns out that Silvia is the last surviving daughter of an old colonial family and her roots in that country are deep and ancient. What Pollack is getting at is quite impressive Its the tragic complexity of Africa a continent so absurdly full of atrocity as it is of nobility with problems that will not go away ever but cant be ignored either. In Silvia we see these contradictions embodied and its a shame really that the thriller aspects of the film and all the emotional fireworks from blubberpuss Penn obscure her. Thats another of its main problems. It cant decide which of its characters -- Penns or Kidmans -- is more interesting and far too much time is spent on Penns a recent widower with that drinking problem and a tendency to unprofessionally spill his guts to civilians in a way no Secret Service agent would possibly consider. Ach it feels so wrong so willfully stupid In other regards as well the film is deficient. In ""Three Days of the Condor"" Pollack had the advantage of a brilliantly engineered thriller (by Washington writer James Grady) that seemed complex from the outside yet revealed itself to be simple as it was penetrated leaving room for both thrills and the deepening relationship between Redford and the woman whose life he took over played by Faye Dunaway. By contrast the plot here as its penetrated gets more and more complex until its almost laughable; it has too many beats too many reverses and in the end seems unbelievable. Then as it turns out most viewers will guess the Big Twist and be annoyed at how ludicrously it plays out in an endless scene that again feels more out of ""Hedda Gabler"" by high schoolers on speed than anything as Penn and the assassin shriek at each other as the assassin pushes a gun against the dictators head. The plot needed an interpreter into Esperanto or even rebus Simple would have been so much better and someone should have put a spit-muzzle on the histrionic Penn. The Interpreter (135 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for some intense violence.

Directed by Sydney Pollack from a screenplay by Charles Randolph Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian. 135 minutes. Rated PG13 for violence some sexual content and brief language. Several theaters. Sydney Pollacks ""The Interpreter"" ticks along like a freshly wound-up clock smart and precise keeping its audience just breathless enough not to notice that more than two hours have passed. Except for Sean Penns performance theres nothing particularly unexpected about it but smart thrillers are a rare enough treat these days. And Pollack now 70 directs with real verve quite enough to make us forget his tepid recent movies (""Random Hearts"" ""Sabrina"") and to remember the skill and craftsmanship of ""Tootsie"" ""They Shoot Horses Dont They?"" and ""Out of Africa."" The film a story about a United Nations interpreter (Nicole Kidman pale as powder) who overhears a death threat against an African head of state gets an added level of gravitas from its surroundings According to the films press materials this is the first motion picture to be filmed inside the U.N.s New York headquarters. (Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest"" among others had to film its U.N. scenes on a look-alike set.) The outside shots of the building a majestic midcentury box seem oddly serene; the interior scenes crackle with life with the furnishings looking just out-of-date enough so that you know theyre real. But for all the films carefully honed atmosphere and polish it still comes down -- as so many movies do -- to the problems of the two little people at its center. Because these people are portrayed by Penn and Kidman ""The Interpreter"" gets not only a movie-star gloss but a pair of meticulously honest performances. Penn plays Tobin Keller a federal agent assigned to investigate the case of Silvia Broome (Kidman). Like the other men Penns played recently Keller is a tortured soul but we dont entirely learn why until late in the film. Hes scrupulously polite and professional but somethings dead behind his eyes and Penn wisely gives the performance little of his usual fireworks. His work here is deliberate and thoughtful his delivery often very simple (listen to the line late in the film ""The only thing I wanted besides having her back was to be left alone"") -- and the result is devastating. Penn rarely appears in thrillers but he understands the power of quiet at the core of a swirling plot. Its a marvelous performance and it elevates the film. Kidman surprisingly is a bit overshadowed by him; her character seems less interesting. The idealistic Silvia is steely but in a predictable way and her lovely face seems less expressive than usual. Shes never less than competent but Pollack only needs one emotion from her -- wary apprehension -- and she disappears from the screen for a long stretch in the third act. This leaves the movie available for stealing and Catherine Keener as Penns partner neatly snatches it up. With her delivery as dry as a U.N. position paper she plays the wry sidekick to perfection. (Upon finding a wired bomb in a suspects apartment she deadpans ""Well thats just rude."") Its a small role but Keener creates a rich character within it sarcastic and funny yet warmhearted beneath -- you see the affectionate bond she has with Keller though the two would never admit it. Keeners been doing terrific work in indie films for years; its nice to see her shine in such a high-profile project.""The Interpreter"" touches on some hot-button issues as its breakneck plot envelopes terrorism a dangerous dictator genocide and the role of the U.N. and its to the credit of Pollack and the screenwriters (Charles Randolph Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian) that it all moves along intelligently and swiftly. (Credit editor William Steinkamp too for a nail-biting sequence on a bus.) But when I think back on ""The Interpreter"" its the quiet control of Penns performance that remains a great actor demonstrating that hes still capable of surprising us.

Starring Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn. Directed by Sydney Pollack. (PG-13. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its hard to know what is more impressive the artistry of ""The Interpreter"" or the sheer craft of it. The lead roles are meticulously inhabited by Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn who play complicated people with lots of sorrow and conflict going on beneath the surface. But just as notable as their artistry is the shrewd construction of this suspense thriller as a whole the way the story unfolds the way director Sydney Pollack handles this big canvas and the ways in which the writers always find a compelling reason for the audience to keep watching -- and worrying. ""The Interpreter"" is an old-fashioned thriller from a director who was making such thrillers when they were new-fashioned. Like his ""Three Days of the Condor"" in 1975 ""The Interpreter"" confirms a paranoiacs worst suspicions. It depicts a world of shadows dangerous and unknowable. Things go on under cover of darkness all of them bad. Knowledge can be fatal and the same goes for ignorance. One person alone doesnt have much of a chance. The person alone in this case is Nicole Kidman as Silvia a U.N. interpreter born in the fictional war-torn African nation of Matobo. Silvia accidentally overhears a conversation over an open microphone between two dissidents planning an assassination. She escapes from the building but the assassins know who she is and they know where she lives. So from that point on not only is the African dictator Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) in peril but she is too. Related Stories A whole world of trouble at U.N. The film keeps the tension simmering focusing on both the personal and the political. It engenders a state of anxiety about what will happen in the larger world at the same time it keeps us anxious about what will become of Silvia. It also ropes us in by complicating Silvias interaction with Keller the Secret Service agent played by Penn. Penn is in charge of security for foreign dignitaries. He listens to Silvias story about overhearing assassination plans and immediately writes her off as a phony. Even with just phoned-in performances ""The Interpreter"" would have been a perfectly satisfying thriller -- the story is riveting enough on its own. So its almost like a bonus to find Kidman and Penn bringing such thought and care to their roles here. They play opposites in type and temperament. He watches for a living and she listens. Hes instinctive and shes methodical. Hes forthright and shes elliptical. But they have two things in common a history of tragedy that has obliterated all faith that life is fair or sensible and dignity in the face of that cold understanding. To see them in ""The Interpreter"" is to be struck by just how skillful and arresting these actors are. In close-up Kidman is radiant -- radiant with intelligence but also with a God-given porcelain radiance that makes her in some lights look like a very wise 20-year-old. As for Penn he does something thats rather difficult to adequately explain. He infuses his entire performance with sadness but then doesnt play the sadness. He plays a guy just doing a job. If he were a house painter you could say he makes sorrow the undercoat and then covers it up so that when you look you see the surface but the surface is informed by whats underneath it. But Im afraid this is a clumsy description of something smooth and intuitive. One of the best scenes in the movie involves nothing dangerous just Silvia and Keller talking on their cell phones in the middle of the night. She is in her apartment and hes in the next building watching over her. The actors find their way to that drawn-out rhythm that happens only in the wee hours when theres no reason to get off the phone and no pressing reason to stay on either to let someone elses voice break the silence. Its a time for bonding when people let their guard down. According to publicity ""The Interpreter"" is the first motion picture ever filmed inside the United Nations and the General Assembly auditorium like most things in life looks a little smaller than it does in the imagination. Previously cameras have been banned but the United Nations made an exception and it picked a good movie to do that for. Though it would be fair to say that in the end Silvia makes a less gratifying heroine than either the Robert Redford character in ""Condor"" or the Tom Cruise character in ""The Firm"" this is a suspense thriller of rare intelligence. -- Advisory This film contains graphic violence.

Although the events depicted in the film are fictional (as is the country in which some of the action transpires) they bear a more-than-passing resemblance to incidents that have rocked African nations in recent decades. This makes the backstory more credible than what one might otherwise expect. The screenplay successfully develops suspense without relying on the bait-and-switch tactics that often leave a viewer dissatisfied with an ""unexpected"" twist. The Interpreter builds to a satisfying conclusion that will not inflict the average audience member with a case of cinematic whiplash. The film is a little overplotted and as is often the case with movies of this sort there is a coincidence that has to be absorbed in order for the story to work. Once the viewer gets over that hump however its clear sailing. Veteran directory Sydney Pollack whose experience in the genre dates back to Three Days of the Condor understands that thrillers work best when the characters are real and by casting Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn two of the best working performers he allows acting to transform the clichA(c)d protagonists into three-dimensional individuals we come to care about. Silvia Broome (Kidman) spent most of her life as a member of the affluent white minority in the African country of Matobo. As an adolescent she lost her mother father and sister to a landmine. Now she works as a translator at the United Nations in New York. Edmond Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) Matobos president and the man Silvia blames for her parents demise is coming to the U.N. to make a speech designed to circumvent his being placed on trial for human rights violations. Late one night when Silvia returns to her sound booth to retrieve some belongings she inadvertently overhears a conversation between two men who are plotting to kill Zuwanie. And when they see her she becomes a target. Enter Secret Service agents Tobin Keller (Penn) and Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) who are called to investigate Silvias story. Tobin is on shaky emotional ground. His wife was recently killed in a car accident and he is fighting to keep it together. At first he is skeptical of Silvias tale - considering her background as a political opponent of Zuwanie it seems unlikely that she would come forward with information that might save his life. But as he spends time with her he begins to trust her and when there is an attempt on her life he takes on the role of her protector. But there are things she isnt telling him and her silence places both of them in danger. The Interpreter pays a great deal of attention to the recent history and politics of its fictional African country. 28 years ago when he came to power Zuwanie was hailed as a hero. But to quote the saying power corrupts. The dictators paranoia led to a ruthless purge of his supposed enemies with many innocents being caught in the crossfire. The word ""genocide"" is spoken aloud not just whispered. Now two rivals work to overthrow Zuwanie but he and his henchmen are aware of the threat they pose. How fine is the line between a good thriller and a poor one? With a less accomplished cast a director less sure of the material and screenwriters who dont fill in as many blanks The Interpreter could have been direct-to-late-night-cable B-movie fare. But it isnt. This is solid welcome entertainment that doesnt rely on car chases and shoot-outs (although both are represented after a fact) to generate tension. The first 60 or 70 minutes of the movie are primarily set-up. As the story moves forward the characters backgrounds are gradually revealed. Once were into the second hour Pollack ratchets up the pace a few notches and we notice a quickening of the pulse. Although primarily designed to get the adrenaline pumping The Interpreter also functions as a morality play asking questions about the value of revenge (""vengeance is a lazy form of grief"" remarks a character at one point) and whether the taking of a life does anything to assuage emotional pain. And theres a low-key love story of sorts. Penn and Kidman both play damaged individuals who find a degree of solace in each others company. The way they connect and the limits they place upon how much comfort they seek is believable. (Its interesting to note that Kidman with her hair lightened almost to blond bears a striking resemblance to Naomi Watts. This causes a dA(c)jA  vu flashback to the Penn/Watts interaction in 21 Grams. That was another film in which pain more than love formed the foundation of a key relationship.) Theres a sense of unpredictability about some of the things that happen in The Interpreter but at no time do any of these turns seem forced. Elements of the ending are facile but nearly all of the loose ends are wrapped up and we dont suffer through the kind of ""happily ever after"" epilogue that would betray The Interpreters underlying dark tone. This is a finely balanced and crafted motion picture. Despite the PG-13 rating which will allow admittance to audiences of all ages Pollack and his screenwriters appear to have crafted this picture with adults in mind.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Sean Penn Nicole Kidman or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? (CNN) -- Sydney Pollack knows his way around a thriller. Hes the director who brought us ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Firm"" and hes a master at slowly building a sense of dramatic urgency until a shattering breaking point is finally achieved.In his new film ""The Interpreter"" -- a finely tuned example of the genre -- Pollack doesnt disappoint.In a scene in which a possible murder is viewed across a courtyard the director follows the action through the window of one apartment into the window of another; the scene moves nicely reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcocks ""Rear Window."" And Hitch would be proud.In one respect Pollack goes Hitchcock one better in ""The Interpreter.""When Hitchcock wanted to shoot 1959s ""North by Northwest"" at U.N. headquarters in New York he was turned down. Pollack received approval which makes ""The Interpreter"" the first feature film actually shot inside the U.N.. The location provides a sense of realism -- and tension -- that otherwise would have been impossible to obtain.""The Interpreter"" stars Nicole Kidman as Silvia Broome a translator who hears a death threat against Edmond Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) the head of state of the fictional African country of Matobo. Hes turned against his people becoming a vicious warlord and his murder is to be carried out in front of the entire world when Zuwanie addresses the U.N.s General Assembly in a few days.Broome who was raised in Matobo and knows a few things about Zuwanie is played by Kidman with equal measures of steel and vulnerability.Differing stylesHer allegations of a murder plot are assigned to Tobin Keller a recently widowed federal agent played by Sean Penn in a terrifically controlled performance. Keller is highly skeptical of Broomes allegations and she doesnt think too highly of him -- or his tactics -- either.Both harbor deep secrets and personal pain and both respond to the pressures of an assassination plot in different ways she reacts to words and diplomacy he relies on action and instinct. However as they race against the clock -- and the tension mounts with each assault against Broome -- they form a tentative truce. Director Sydney Pollack knows how to raise the level of dread in ""The Interpreter.""How their feelings slowly change from uneasy distrust to unlikely bond is a testament to how artfully both Kidman and Penn have subtly layered their characters shifting interactions. They make the characters and the relationship their own.Catherine Keener is excellent as Kellers partner the dry-witted unflappable Dot Woods -- although her character turns into wallpaper halfway through the movie when the plot completely shifts to Keller and Broome. (Too bad.) And as he often does Pollock also acts in one of his films; this time around hes a department head for the Secret Service.Taking its timeThe plot with its elements of international political unrest genocide and terrorism -- at one point theres a terrorist attack in the streets of New York City -- resonates deeply. Indeed its fairly easy to think of the fictional country of Matobo as the African nation of Zimbabwe and Edward Zuwanie as a thinly veiled stand-in for Zimbabwes leader Robert Mugabe.In an exception to the rule of thrillers nowadays -- which insist on an explosion every five minutes -- the plot is allowed to unravel slowly providing no easy pat answers to many of the complex questions in the storyline. When the climax comes its doubly thrilling -- and unexpected.""The Interpreter"" features mind-snapping suspense a provocative intelligent script (courtesy of Charles Randolph Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian) dynamic direction and fine performances by two of the worlds most accomplished actors.In fact Id say its one of the best films of the year but given the lackluster movie year so far that sounds like damning with faint praise. So lets say this ""The Interpreter"" is top-notch entertainment and well worth your nine bucks.""The Interpreter"" is rated PG-13.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

The film is plot-heavy and superficially suffers from a lack of chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn. Commercial prospects look reasonable rather than rousing. A genuine international thriller set almost entirely in New York City in and around the United Nations ""The Interpreter"" is coolly absorbing without being pulse-quickening. A return by director Sydney Pollack after the misfires of ""Sabrina"" and ""Random Hearts"" to the twisty suspense terrain of ""Three Days of the Condor"" the film is plot-heavy and superficially suffers from a lack of chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn that is not inconsistent with their characters interactions. Commercial prospects look reasonable rather than rousing. No film not even Alfred Hitchcocks ""North by Northwest"" has ever been given permission to shoot at U.N. headquarters before (it reportedly took a personal meeting between Pollack and Kofi Annan to clinch the deal) and ""The Interpreter"" takes outstanding but unostentatious advantage of its opportunity to show off the nearly 60-year-old building in all its modernist splendor. The most recognizable room the General Assembly is also where the most decisive and extensive action takes place but good use is also made of the Security Council lobby private rooms and outdoor courtyards as completely fresh locations for narrative drama. The story concocted by two scribes and fleshed out by three more does not lack for contemporary relevance even as it transplants the conflicts of a far-away region to Americas doorstep. On balance the structural machinations drive the characters although its political orientation is liberally well-intended to highlight the plight of those -- in this case Africans -- suffering under murderous dictatorial regimes. In a country one could be excused for imagining is Robert Mugabes Zimbabwe but is called Matobo a five-minute pre-credits sequence has a white observer being shown dozens of rotting corpses at a dusty soccer stadium before being blown away by a pubescent boy with a very large gun. The mans photographer friend waiting in a car grabs a few pictures before escaping with his life. Its an hour before we see the friend again or are led to hope we might learn what happened at the arena. In the meantime the pic takes up the life of U.N. translator Silvia Broome (Kidman) one of whose languages happens to be Ku; its the dialect (concocted for the film) spoken in Matobo where Silvia was raised. On an evening after a precautionary General Assembly evacuation Silvia overhears a barely audible whisper in Ku threatening death to the Teacher the nickname of Dr. Zuwanie the genocidal longtime leader of Matobo due to address the U.N. in a few days. Brought in to assess Silvias trustworthiness is Secret Service agent Tobin Keller (Penn) a heavy-hooded fellow morose over his wife recently having flown the coop. Quickly pegging Silvia as a liar Tobin has a number of measured testy talks with the translator who speaks with an accent thats British by way of southern Africa and is more easily rattled than most heroines in this era of self-assured bigscreen female role models. Clearly there is more than so agreeably meets the eye where the silky blonde Silvia is concerned and its little surprise that with her as well as with nearly all the supporting characters all roads lead back to Matobo and the nasty things that happened there. While Tobin his world-weary associate Dot (Catherine Keener) and other feds peer into Silvias apartment through binoculars and follow her all over New York a number of other suspicious characters are shuffled into the mix including Nils Lud (Jesper Christensen) Zuwanies white security specialist; Kuman-Kuman (the vibrant George Harris) a Gotham-based opposition leader to Zuwanie; Jean Gamba (Byron Utley) a dangerous provocateur of mysterious allegiances and Philippe (Yvan Attal) the photographer who cant cope with what went down at the soccer stadium but who brings some key information to the table. Due to Silvias hypertension and Tobins mournful demeanor the characters dialogue exchanges have a hushed tight-reined quality that keeps the proceedings at a relatively low temperature. With different casting a romantic/erotic undercurrent might have been established between these two highly pressured individuals which without bubbling over would still have given the drama an extra charge. As enacted by Kidman and Penn Silvia and Tobin seem like people who never would have gotten together under any circumstances. Theyre essentially opposites and ones that dont attract. This fits all right with the story but may frustrate general viewers on basic movie-movie terms. Pollack nicely pulls off the two big set pieces first a long tense scene aboard a bus in Brooklyn that ends in shocking violence then the assassination attempt on Zuwanie at the General Assembly indicated at the outset. A follow-up sequence is significantly marred dramatically when a central figure is unaccountably left alone and unprotected and wrap-up is mealy-mouthed. As always Pollacks polished professionalism reps a significant pleasure in itself and the presence of the U.N. front-and-center is a spectacle to behold. Darius Khondjis splendid widescreen lensing and Jon Hutmans production design are major bonuses whereas James Newton Howards score is too on-the-money in its emphasis on would-be suspense. Her hair like corn threads and her skin the color of the moon Kidman looks more youthful than she has in her last few pictures and more fragile. Her seeming mastery of the invented Ku language (not to mention French) is duly impressive. Penns usual volatility is suppressed as much as its ever been. Supporting cast members uniformly succeed in the important task of etching strong impressions so one can more or less remember whos who when multiple foreign names are rapidly rattled off. Earl Cameron who portrays the reviled Dr. Zuwanie may be remembered by buffs from his appearance 40 years ago in James Bond pic ""Thunderball.""

"The Interpreter high-minded stodginess no thrills. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Interpreter high-minded stodginess no thrills. The Interpreter high-minded stodginess no thrills. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.April 21 2005 502 PM Lost in Translation The Interpreter is all high-minded stodginess and no thrills. By David Edelstein How do you say ""earnest"" in Ku? We should all be grateful when A-list Academy Award-winning talents come together to do something more meaningful than a mere cloak-and-dagger thriller a thriller with a message of peace and nonviolence and a commitment to international human rights; a thriller that incorporates a non-Western philosophy thats radically different from the usual eye-for-an-eye red-meat opportunism of most American action movies. We should be grateful but we are lowly imperfect creatures. Besides The Interpreter (Universal) is too bloated with its own significance to deliver the requisite thrills. Its directed by Sydney Pollack who made one of the scariest paranoid thrillers of the post-Watergate era Three Days of the Condor and whose legendary clashes with Dustin Hoffman helped produce the fluke comic masterpiece Tootsie. But Pollacks Oscar for Out of Africa convinced him he was a major artist and his subsequent movies have been weighted down by humorlessness and self-importance. Advertisement Speaking of humorlessness and self-importance The Interpreter gives us Sean Penn with gray hair at the temples as a Secret Service agent trying to foil a mysterious (and possibly nonexistent) assassination plot against an African dictator planning to give a speech to the United Nations General Assembly. The problem is that Penn cant play just any agent trying to do his job. He has to have his own traumatic back story and overflowing well of grief over a dead wife because whats a Penn performance these days without the actor emoting in close-up for a camera frozen in awe? (You can practically hear the director say ""And now ladies and gentleman the stylings of the premier actor of his generation."") My theory--and its just a theory my evidence is only whats on screen--is that a multimillion-dollar rewrite guy (either Steven Zaillian or Scott Frank who both get a credit with Charles Randolph) got hired to load emotional baggage onto Penns part. Otherwise the focus would be entirely on Nicole Kidman as a U.N. interpreter named Silvia Broome. Silvia leaves a bag in her translation booth and when she returns to get it overhears a whispered plot to assassinate the president of the fictional African country of Matobo Zuwanie--an idealistic liberator turned ethnic cleanser. Silvia reports what she heard to the authorities but Penns Tobin Keller thinks shes hiding something. After all she has a back story of her own and many reasons to despise Zuwanie. She also has a very peculiar accent. Early on there are some good ping-pong exchanges between Kidman and Penn but the hostility between the two characters seems a mite trumped up. Kidman is excellent although shes once again upstaged by those locks of hair that hang artfully in her face. It must have been very hard for Pollack to answer the old ""Whats my motivation?"" query because Silvia seems to have about 10 conflicting motivations in the course of the movie. A former Matoban rebel shes now the films spokesman for a nonviolent ethos she translates from the ""Ku"" language which holds that vengeance is a lazy way of mourning and that you have to rescue your drowning enemy to be healed. She and Penns Keller fix their blue eyes on each other and have a lot of dark-night-of-the-soul exchanges that take the wind out of an already convoluted conspiracy plot. A light touch would help but the lightest character and actor--Catherine Keener as Kellers tart colleague--gets left out of all the fun. And with the exception of a well-designed set piece involving several agents and suspects converging on the same bus The Interpreter is stodgy and misshapen. It manages to be both thoroughly confusing and entirely predictable thanks to a climactic plot twist that you can see limping toward you about an hour before the maudlin hero manages to. That climax comes with a civics lesson in which the heroine spells out that ethnic cleansing is a very bad thing. I couldnt agree more. But I also wished for a little less highmindedness in the pacing department. The Interpreter is so lofty it feels as if it were made to be screened at the United Nations. Update My hush-hush Hollywood inside sources tell me that the Keller back-story was in Charles Randolphs original script which was rewritten to accommodate the needs of Nicole Kidman not Sean Penn. It sounds like Randolphs climactic revelation was much more compelling and would have taken some of the sanctimoniousness out of the climax. Also apparently tested but not used was an ending in which John Bolton becomes incensed when Nicole Kidman does not translate ""Matobo has lovely veldts"" as ""Matobo has lethal nukes"" and chases her around the U.N. with a machete.

These days you cant move without tripping over a Hollywood movie about global catastrophe much of it happening in Manhattan. In Sydney Pollacks ambitious new political thriller The Interpreter Nicole Kidman plays a United Nations translator who becomes a moving target of more than one murky agency when she slips on her earphones during a routine bomb-scare evacuation and overhears a whispered exchange that suggests a visiting African head of state is scheduled for assassination. I can think of better casting than Kidman -- Cate Blanchett say or Kate Winslet or the sorely neglected Madeleine Stowe -- to play a sophisticate as cerebral as Silvia Broome a multilingual former activist in the same fictitious African country as the menaced potentate. Still Kidman looks delectable in a careless ponytail and rimless glasses gliding around New York on a beat-up Vespa and she makes a fetching Beauty to the stoically wounded Beast assigned by the FBI to give her round-the-clock protection -- or is it surveillance? By way of introduction agent Tobin Keller whom we have briefly glimpsed drowning his wedding ring in a double Scotch at a nearby bar tells Silvia ""They hire us for our forgettable faces."" Since the patently unforgettable mug in question belongs to Sean Penn who is known for taking his face and the gray matter behind it extremely seriously we must be grateful that the crisp screenplay credited to Charles Randolph Scott Frank and Steven Zaillian has given him a saving feel for irony and behind his characters stern professional exterior an inviting softness of temperament. Not to mention a pleasant nocturnal habit of monitoring his attractive charge through binoculars from an adjacent high-rise. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In the way of all thrillers Keller and Silvia come to their uneasy partnership toting hastily sketched tragic back stories that serve on the one hand to cement their growing bond on the other to further the movies endlessly curling plot which winds back and forth between the U.N. building the land of Matobo (a thinly veiled blend of Zimbabwe and Mozambique) and back to Crown Heights for an explosive set piece that could only have been staged at a safe four years remove from the Twin Towers tragedy. For all Pollacks strenuous efforts to spread suspicion among several possible assassins -- including Silvia herself who comes under scrutiny when it turns out that she was once active in a militant wing of Matobos resistance movement and has ample reason to want to see the dictator Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) dead -- if youre on your toes youll have fingered at least one of the perps 20 minutes into the movie. In truth Pollack has always been stronger and livelier addressing gender politics (one thinks of Tootsie and The Way We Were if not the comatose Sabrina) than he is at making political thrillers. Kidman and Penns moody chemistry make of The Interpreter a compelling love story however understated. But notwithstanding a neat little plot fillip at the end as a thriller the film is no more than competent and enjoyable in the way that Pollacks The Firm was with its equally functional visual style and certainly no more exciting. Still theres fascination in the movies mapping of a political landscape -- part wish part fear -- that reveals as much about the contradictions in liberal American attitudes in the international arena as it does about global terror and diplomacy in a post-9/11 world. Zuwanie is a familiar Third World figure the liberator turned corrupt dictator and though Pollack is careful to acknowledge the legacy of white colonialism and to balance the despot with a more demotic black luminary who likes to take the bus and commune with the people of Manhattan Zuwanies resemblance to Zimbabwes murderous Robert Mugabe is powerful enough to make one wish that his assassins would have at him and be done with it. When it comes to the United Nations though the movie turns to Jell-O. Whether Pollack was softened up by his meetings with U.N. brass (all the way up to Kofi Annan) or by his own gentlemanly Midwestern liberalism he is alarmingly circumspect about that august body. The dialogue is studded with high-minded proclamations about the triumph of diplomacy and order over vengeance and chaos and dappled with homespun African proverbs about the saving balm of charitable behavior. Thats all very nice but you would hardly know from The Interpreter that were talking about one of the most impotent organizations on the global stage at once struggling with its own internal sources of corruption and often as not serving as a vassal of various national or regional interests not least of all those of the United States. For all its contempo global reach The Interpreter comes off as a throwback to the thrillers of the Cold War only now with different nations as enemies. You can hardly hear the still small voice that halfway through the movie quietly murmurs ""There are no nations any more only companies"" and falls away.?

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Kontroll a Hungarian quasi-thriller of considerable gloomy charm won the Prix de la Jeunesse Award at Cannes last year and its easy to see why. Set entirely in the depths of the Budapest subway system -- at no point in its 106-minute running time do we see the light of day -- the movie combines high-speed rail chases and schoolboy prankishness with the kind of romantic alienation that many young people wear with their basic black and assume will see them through the rest of their lives. Writer-director Nimrod Antal still in his early 30s lived in Los Angeles long enough to acquire a slight Tarantino swagger. But then he went home to study filmmaking and his movie is unmistakably European in style -- Tarkovsky by way of the Kaurismakis with a dab of Jim Jarmusch. The plot such as it is centers on a group of ticket inspectors a wan lethargic breed apparently much reviled by Budapest commuters. At their helm is Bulcsu (Sandor Csanyi) a moody young refugee from a better life aboveground with the hollow-eyed good looks of a young Paul Henreid. Though he manages to keep his little band of losers together despite bullying from management competition from a rival group of inspectors and intermittent provocations by a fleet-footed teenage stowaway Bulcsu appears to have given up on life. To make matters worse hes haunted by a mysterious hooded figure who creeps up behind commuters and pushes them into the path of oncoming trains. Then comes love and hope in a form only an Eastern European surrealist could conjure up that of an exquisite woman in a teddy-bear costume with a ludicrously padded rear end. Kontroll is goofy smart and beguiling and it whips up an almost unbearable luster from its grimy subterranean labyrinth -- a gorgeously lit image of Bulcsu sitting disconsolate atop a huge vent in the tunnel is unforgettably wistful. What the movie lacks is a point unless you count Bulcsus rote existential quest. But Nimrod Attal has time on his side and we should expect to see much more and much better from this talented young filmmaker.

Advance reservations passport security clearance and appropriate dress will do to admit a visitor into an elegant affordable lunchtime adventure that may be the closest a nonemployee will ever get to experiencing the daily hum of ritual mystery diplomacy and bureaucracy with which the worlds deliberative body has held together in imperfect harmony for 60 years. Or you could watch The Interpreter an elegant adventure of a different kind Among its many accomplishments this capacious and worldly drama directed by Sydney Pollack is a serious invitation -- a mature filmmakers exhortation really -- for Americans to engage globally even while seeking local entertainment. (In this regard the man who made Three Days of the Condor and The Firm is back where his heart lies in the realm of crisp engrossing dramas about power.) Its also an old pros demonstration of how a politically relevant big-release flick can still effectively be done old school -- not snazzily by no means perfectly (what with popcorn conventions grafted onto matters of current events) but squarely in the best most adult sense of the word. In setting a thriller about explosive politics to the rhythms of moderation -- the beat of the U.N. itself in all its sober and sometimes maddening temperateness -- Pollack chooses the unusual architecture of making the actual corridors crannies and cool modernist expanses of the United Nations the star of the show. The human luminaries Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn are mere mortals in proportion their characters overplotted and intertwined personal and professional anguish a light distraction from the affecting themes at hand. And the change of scale is tonic for both of them. Kidman applies her essential milk-tinted stillness to the role of Silvia Broome the sad estranged daughter of the unstable fictional African country of Matobo. She holds the title job despite a political activist past (and it quickly emerges present) that might eliminate a less ethereally stylish-looking candidate from the job. In her microphone booth after hours one day she overhears something -- she says its a death threat against the oppressive Matoban head of state due to give a speech to the General Assembly -- and when shes spotted her life is put in danger. It is perhaps inevitable that Tobin Keller (Penn) the federal agent assigned to check her story is himself a man of constant sorrows or that despite uneasy suspicion about his charges own involvement in the plot Tobin finds himself drawn to Silvias brand of hurting. It is less of a given that Penns concentrated intensity -- volatility pulled inward -- should work so brilliantly against Kidmans soft inaccessibility her daintily careful African accent of indeterminate provenance. The unusual pairing of powerhouses both skilled at intelligent risk-taking in the line of Hollywood duty results in a strong partnership that overcomes the plots twitchy insistence on complications above and beyond the call of a movie about revolution political activism and an all-too-believable climate of terrorism. And Pollack working with cinematographer Darius Khondji shoots the stars with a kind of grandeur lighting and setting them with grave regard for their wattage. (Catherine Keener outstanding in a subtle serious performance as Tobins partner receives similar A-game treatment.) The Interpreter argues for a lot of things -- too many. The story advocates the power of words over more lethal weaponry (Silvia speaks eloquently about the precision of language explaining to Tobin that ""if dead and gone were the same thing thered be no U.N."") but pays attention to the desperation that can lead a populace to guns. The script (a relay-team effort as emphasis and world events including 9/11 changed the projects focus over its long years in development) honors the importance of the U.N. in a way no permission-to-film-granting authority could fault but still captures the obtuseness that is as much an institutional trademark as the contours of its famous buildings. The films hodgepodge agenda doesnt though matter in the end and neither do the position speeches about everything from grief (Tobin is an alarmingly fresh widower) to protocol in the General Assembly inserted between bouts of cat-and-mouse action. What does signify and what builds with unexpected poignancy is the movies expression of love -- for an authentic New York City so fondly photographed for a U.N. so remarkable in its very existence however complicated and for people trying to work things out in a civilized way. The alternative The Interpreter makes very clear cannot be interpreted as anything other than disaster.
