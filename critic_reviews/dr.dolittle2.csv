"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Dr. Dolittle 2 Gas Menagerie By Rita Kempley Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 22 2001 Eddie Murphy talks to the animals in ""Dr. Dolittle 2."" (20th Century Fox) Dr. Dolittle does a lot for the environment in ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" a wisecracking follow-up to the 1998 tale of the genial multilingual physician. Star Eddie Murphy who was upstaged by the talking animals in the original brings bite as well as bark to the funnier sequel. He squawks the squawk and walks the walk all with a wink at the grown-ups. But he doesnt spoil the fun for kids who will be enchanted by the adorable creatures and aghast as prisspots may be will roar at the movies many potty jokes particularly one involving a flatulent bear.In this outing Dr. Dolittles medical practice has grown out of control and hes trying to spend more time with his family when hes approached by Joey the raccoon (voiced by Michael Rapaport) consigliere of the God Beaver (Richard C. Sarafian). The beaver wants a meeting with the doctor who reluctantly bails out on his daughters birthday party to follow Joey into the woods.When he meets the God Beaver and his weaselly cronies Dolittle begins to suspect hes become involved with some kind of animal mafia. ""Im just a simple fisherman whos been blessed with many friends"" responds the beaver who goes on to make an ""offer"" the kindhearted hero cannot refuse A heartless developer (Jeffrey Jones) and his smarmy lawyer (Kevin Pollak) are out to make mulch of the animals wilderness home. And hes their only hope.Dolittle manages to stay the ax but only for three weeks when he learns the tract is the habitat of an endangered species of bear protected by law. Sadly theres only one female Ava (voiced by Lisa Kudrow) left in the wild and unless the doctor can find her a mate the forest will be razed.The he discovers Archie (voiced by Steve Zahn) a borscht-belt bear who doesnt know from the call of the wild. Hes spent his whole life in show business. Archie was born in a trunk - an elephants trunk Ba-da-boom Okay so hes not a great comic but then neither is Deputy Dawg. It takes some doing but the doctor persuades Archie to give up his creature comforts and return to the forest by promising him hell be more famous than Pooh. But its almost too late. In her desperation for cubs Ava has taken up dating a hunky kodiak and the prospects for a happy ending dim when she declines Archies suit.Sure Archie makes her laugh but Ava wants a bear capable of supporting a family. And she isnt about to be seduced by his terrible rendition of ""I Will Survive."" Theres only one thing to do Dolittle must help Archie get in touch with his inner grizzly. Now motivated by the first stirrings of love Archie makes a serious attempt to adapt to the country life no mean feat for a bear whose turn-ons are long soaks in his tub his own trailer and a diet of junk food.While the film also has its Cosby family moments - and would be too thin without the tired subplot about Dad dealing with Daughters first date - its carried over the rough spots by the odd coupling of Murphy and Zahn. Thats not to negate the contributions of the movies adorable menagerie including incidental characters like a pig who whispers ""Hello Clarice"" when Dolittle passes his pen.Despite a subversive sense of humor ""Dr. 2"" has its obligatory perhaps even sincere messages about respect for not only our own families but also the family of Mother Earth. Talk about unbearable.""Dr. Dolittle 2"" (87 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for language and crude humor.

With Eddie Murphy as the San Francisco physician who can converse with animals sequel abounds in funny business that auds of all ages can enjoy. Even more family-friendly than its immensely popular predecessor -- and conspicuously less raunchy than the ""Nutty Professor"" comedies that also showcase its charismatic star -""Dr. Dolittle 2"" has all the symptoms of a sure-fire smash hit. With Eddie Murphy once again in fine form as the San Francisco physician who can converse with animals sequel abounds in funny business that auds of all ages can enjoy and showcases impressive f/x wizardry that enhances the central gimmick of trans-species communication. The prognosis An extended theatrical run fortified by chronic repeat biz followed by massive outbreaks of homevid rentals and sales. Murphy again toplines as Dr. John Dolittle an updated version of the character introduced in classic childrens stories by Hugh Lofting (which also inspired the 1967 musical starring Rex Harrison). In the 1998 ""Dr. Dolittle"" which grossed 293 million worldwide Murphys kindly but easily discombobulated medico learned to finally accept his long-suppressed gift for talking with animals. In the follow-up Dr. Dolittle uses his talents to aid woodland creatures in their efforts to keep their forest from being destroyed by rapacious loggers. To help the imperiled critters the good doctor must delay plans for a European vacation with Lisa (Kristen Wilson) his lawyer wife and their two daughters Charisse (Raven-Symone) and Maya (Kyla Pratt). The timing couldnt be worse Charisse already in the early stages of moody-teen rebellion no longer is amused by her fathers antics and claims to be embarrassed by his much-publicized adventures as adviser and interpreter for birds and beasts. Even so Dr. Dolittle cant say no to a Godfatherly beaver (voiced by Richard C. Sarafian) who needs outside help to protect the other creatures in his forest turf. Thanks to his wifes legal maneuvering the doc obtains a temporary restraining order to stop logging exec Joseph Potter (Jeffrey Jones) from clear-cutting the forest. To permanently protect the woodland however Dr. Dolittle must sustain an endangered species by finding a mate for Ava (Lisa Kudrow) the last surviving Pacific Western bear in the forest. Trouble is theres only one other Pacific Western bear to be found Archie (Steve Zahn) a raised-in-captivity performing bear whose natural habitat is a sideshow stage. Archie likes the look of Eva but hes reluctant to end his showbiz career -- he specializes in dancing and motorcycle riding -- for the purpose of long-term mating. And hes none too eager to pursue a lifestyle that would entail foraging for food and hibernating in caves. So Dr. Dolittle reluctantly accompanied by his family must temporarily move into a forest cabin to facilitate the mating process. Think of it as a kind of extended house call. Much of ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" revolves around the docs therapeutic efforts to help Archie get in touch with his inner bear. As a result Murphy plays -- as he did in the previous ""Dolittle"" pic -- a primarily reactive role responding to the chatty wildlife around him. But Murphy doesnt appear at all uncomfortable by being restrained by the demands of the part. Indeed hes ingratiating and extremely amusing even as he serves as straight man to trained animals and seamlessly integrated animatronics. He knows precisely when to emphasize the fussiness of his character when to be to comically excitable and when to provide a pricelessly funny double take. Working from a script by Larry Levin co-writer of the 98 ""Dolittle"" director Steve Carr (""Next Friday"") maintains a suitably zippy pace and keeps the animal flatulence jokes to a bare minimum. (Unlike its slightly more scatological PG-13-tagged predecessor sequel rates a PG.) Wilson reprising her perf as Lisa Dolittle does little to smooth the brittle edge that characters such as hers -- i.e. often-snippy not-always-sympathetic spouses -usually display in pics such as this. Other two-legged supporting players are unremarkably competent. Of course every human onscreen even Murphy is repeatedly upstaged by animals digitally augmented by the Rhythm amp; Hues f/x team. Mouth movements and hand ... errr paw gestures are skillfully faked. But the perfectly cast vocal talents are what really make the illusion work. Zahn brings a slightly goofy gee-whiz quality to Archie (whos played by an ursine thesp named Tank the Bear) while Sarafian scores big laughs as the God Beaver blithely dismisses the suggestion that he has underworld ties. (""Im just a simple fisherman whos blessed with many friends."") Other standouts include Michael Rapaport as a tough-guy raccoon Isaac Hayes as a sleepy-sounding possum and Kevin Pollak (who also plays the logging execs lawyer) as a crocodile who snaps at a TV nature-show host. Norm Macdonald makes a welcome return as the voice of Lucky a sardonic dog who gets some of the best lines while providing running commentary.

Singer Entertainment 20th Century Fox Film Corporation; Release Date Wide 06/22/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 90; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted August 9 2006 -- 1200 AM EDT If you believe that animals really are little people in fuzzy suits - and what small child doesnt? - then the innocuous anthropomorphic high jinks of Dr. Dolittle 2 will make you very happy indeed. If youre a parent looking to blow 81 minutes on a sequel that painlessly combines cute talking critters a hug a tree message broad enough for a 2 year old to catch and a few de rigueur poop jokes heres your cinematic babysitter. And if youre a person who thinks animals is animals - and that providing them with digitally animated lips so they can crack ""Whasssup?"" jokes is wishfully misguided humanoid thinking - well the feral bipeds of ""Sexy Beast"" are showing around the corner. Once again Eddie Murphy plays the beguiling buppie straight man M.D. who talks to the animals; he gives a reined in performance that every so often shows a spark of the ""Shrek""ish donkey within. The plot of ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" though is pure kiddie matinee stuff involving the doctors efforts to save a tract of forest from meanie loggers by coaxing an endangered species circus bear to shed his citified ways and pitch woo to an ursine wild honey. The cast of human actors behind the animatronic lips provides a modicum of delight to demiceleb spotters Steve Zahn (""Happy Texas"") and ""Friends"" Lisa Kudrow give the romantic bears eccentric voice and everyone from Isaac Hayes (a possum) to Andy Dick (a weasel) to Joey Lauren Adams (a squirrel) has fun with their respective animal correlatives. But you dont have to be a card carrying PETA member to get the uneasy sense that the loggers arent the only ones exploiting nature Its there in the fake forest sets and in the stunts that Tank the bear rotely obligingly turns for his offscreen trainer. If only the storys essential fantasy were true I bet the animal reaction to ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" would be biting.

"USATODAY.com - Romantic Dolittle bears watching Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/21/2001 - Updated 0537 PM ET Romantic Dolittle bears watching By Mike Clark USA TODAY Dr. Dolittle 2 (out of four) Stars Eddie Murphy Kristen Wilson Raven-Symone with the voices of Steve Zahn Lisa Kudrow Norm Macdonald Director Steve Carr Distributor 20th Century Fox Rating PG for language and crude humor With Pearl Harbor fading at the box office as deserved Hollywood doesnt have to wage war to substitute one Doolittle (Gen. James) with another. The replacement is Eddie Murphy reprising his 1998 role as Dr. Dolittle -- chum to all creatures a modern-day Noah in the making. And compared with your everyday talking-animal movie Dr. Dolittle 2 has occasional droll moments though theyre interspersed between more lulls than any movie running under 90 minutes should have. But whenever it feels pressure to hit the targeted PG audience the sequel follows what has become all but a big-screen requirement in recent years It puts the doo in Do-2. Read more Video Dr. Dolittle 2 trailer Photo Gallery Animals on film Its easy to take this low road with an animal cast but in its heart this is a romantic movie. Murphys John Dolittle is trying to save an endangered forest from evil loggers by proving that Ava its lone female bear inhabitant (voice of Lisa Kudrow) can procreate successfully if she can just find the right guy. The good doctors mission is to play Cupid even if Ava calls him a ""bear pimp."" Ava says shes looking for an Alpha bear that can protect her but the best the doc can find is an indoor wimp (voice of Steve Zahn) raised in a carnival with a love for disco tunes. The grizzly Archie tries to toughen himself up while Dolittle tries to connect with his older daughter (Raven-Symone) who is going through a pouty adolescent stage in what will surely be one of the dreariest subplots this summer. Archie sings Barry Manilows Copacabana a raccoon greets Dolittle with a ""Yo"" and the doctor prescribes whatever passes as Viagra for a turtle to help him get it on with his lady friend after a 48-year dry spell. Its the kind of material that is either going to make your day or not though parents who have been dragged into past kiddie-pic trenches wont come out battered and scarred. While this Dolittle does too little its harmless.

Eddie Murphy plays second fiddle to a bear named Archie in ""Dr. Dolittle 2."" Not what the doctor ordered / In ""Dolittle sequel Eddie Murphys barely there 1 / 1 Back to Gallery DR. DOLITTLE 2 Comedy. Starring Eddie Murphy. Directed by Steve Carr. (PG. 89 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Eddie Murphy in ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" is a sleek Jaguar XK8 running on idle. It is the Eddie Murphy movie where Eddie Murphy has next to nothing to do. Do little says it all. In this unnecessary sequel to his 1998 hit Murphy has been reduced to a go- between for a circus bear and one in the wild. Hes the yenta who must get them to mate. ""Dolittle 2"" is a nice sweet little movie as far as it goes but nice and sweet are not the reasons we want to see Murphy. He is left playing straight man to a passel of talking animals and thats only half of it. Murphy has gone green. As the San Francisco doctor who chats up all creatures great and small he enlists the critters in a scheme to save a forest from clear-cutters. The forest is the home of a bear named Ava one of the endangered ""Pacific western"" species. Dolittle must persuade the performing bear Archie to mate with her -- is that why theyre called performing bears? -- and save their love nest (the forest). Sigh. In ""Dolittle 2"" there are talking animals of all sizes and shapes and ethnic types -- live animals animatronic ones animated ones all computer- assisted. A raccoon and a weasel are a couple of mafiosi voiced by Michael Rapaport and Andy Dick respectively. Isaac Hayes plays possum. Steve Zahn is the voice of not-too-bright 800-pound Archie a bush league song-and-dance bear with stars in his eyes. Lisa Kudrow is the blase Ava who is not at all impressed. She wants a real bear of a boyfriend. Norm Macdonald again is the voice of Dolittles dog Lucky who narrates. Speaking of voices the best Eddie Murphy movie out there right now continues to be ""Shrek"" where hes the voice of the donkey. Despite all the animals -- or because of them -- Murphy has no one to play against. Theres a spark of hope when rapper-soul singer Lil Zane shows up as the unwelcome boyfriend as far as Dolittles concerned of his going-on-16 daughter. Lil Zane quickly brings a little life to the screen but the story just as quickly leaves him behind. ""So young so angry -- damn that rap music"" comments a Yoda-like chameleon (Jacob Vargas) and thats about the best line the old guy can manage. Later we know were really in trouble when the movies biggest laugh flies in on bear flatulence. There are some routine shots of San Francisco but the cliches dont stop there. Jeffrey Jones and Kevin Pollak are a couple of meany land grabbers and even they seem impatient to get this sappy perfunctory plotline out of the way. When youve got a star as big as Murphy on your hands youve got to give him something to do. Dolittle even brings up the idea of a taking the family on a European vacation. Sounds as if theyre already setting up another sequel. If Murphy isnt careful hes gonna turn into Chevy Chase.

The actors playing his family do little more. Still thanks to the wildlife this is a well-intentioned and fairly inventive kids movie. The so-so plotting eventually takes a back seat to a cast of talented comedians and comic actors who lend their voices to the animals. The dialogue is more than the usual string of pop culture references that are supposed to be ""funny"" simply because you can recognize them. As the story opens Dolittle has come to accept his amazing ability to converse with wildlife. Hes now a celebrity and has all kinds of furry creatures running around his home. It makes for an often hilarious hubbub. Highlights include a wine-swilling monkey (voiced by Phil Proctor) who swears hes drinking Gatorade a chameleon (Jacob Vargas) who isnt as adept at camouflage as he thinks he is and a Mafioso raccoon (Michael Rapaport) who speaks in flowery underworld argot.

"Dr. Dolittle 2 | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dr-dolittle-2 ) Dr. Dolittle 2 (United States 2001) A movie review by James Berardinelli About the most positive comment I can offer about Dr. Dolittle 2 is that its not as painful to endure as its 1998 predecessor Dr. Dolittle. Unlike the earlier Eddie Murphy effort about the M.D. who can talk with animals the second installment makes no pretense of being family-oriented entertainment - this is kids-only fare (hence the PG-rating). Potentially audience members over the age of 12 wont find much to laugh at or be amused by in this by-the-numbers comedy that uses sledgehammer tactics to convey its politically correct message. Of course to balance out the films social conscience there has to be one gross-out scene - in this case it involves a bear with flatulence. Many of the principal characters have returned - the good doctor his uninteresting wife Lisa (Kristen Wilson who couldnt be more plastic if she tried) and his two kids perky Maya (Kyla Pratt) and rebellious Charisse (Raven-Symone). This time around Dr. Dolittle is on a crusade to save a forest that a lumber company plans to clear-cut and the mean-spirited Mr. Potter (Jeffrey Jones playing a villain inspired by the bad guy in Its a Wonderful Life) and his sleazy lawyer (Kevin Pollak) will do anything to stop him. Dolittle believes that if he can repopulate an endangered species of bear in the area the courts will have to refuse permission to cut. So its up to him to convince a city bear (voiced by the laconic Steve Zahn) and a country bear (Lisa Kudrow) to get together and make a few cubs. Meanwhile in a subplot that could have been stolen from a bad TV sitcom Dolittle is having problems with his 16-year old offspring Charisse who has discovered boys and the desire to be free of her parents strings. Dr. Dolittle 2 is saddled with a juvenile screenplay aimed squarely at a grade-school audience. No attempt is made to include more than an occasional sly reference or clever aside for older viewers. The humor like everything else is geared towards pint-sized patrons who are apt to laugh at any funny facial expression and the occasional (or in some cases not-so-occasional) expulsion of gas. For an adult the comedy quotient is low - although not as low as that of the first film. Predictably the loudest laughter at the screening I attended occurred during the flatulence scene with Dolittle trapped in a small room desperately trying to inhale fresh air through a partially open window. I dont think I have found this kind of thing funny since I hit puberty and certainly not since I graduated junior high school. (I sometimes wonder if people really find this stuff humorous or if they laugh because they know its expected.) Its a little ironic that Eddie Murphy once known for his raw and uncompromising comedy has appeared in two PG-rated films this summer. Even more intriguing is that the animated one Shrek is far more sophisticated and intelligent than the live-action one Dr. Dolittle 2. One could successfully argue that Murphy is this movies sole redeeming feature. Hes not in peak form but he comes across as relaxed and his performance is unforced. Sadly hes not funny enough to rescue the proceedings. The lackluster special effects (the animal ""lip synching"" is awful) and pedestrian direction (by relative unknown Steve Carr) dont help matters. About the most fun to be had by the average adult trapped in a theater showing this movie will be playing ""guess the animal voice"" - Norm Macdonald Molly Shannon Lisa Kudrow Steve Zahn and so on. Dr. Dolittle 2 exists solely because Dr. Dolitle was financially successful (it raked in 144 million domestically). Like a couple of recent sequel bombs 102 Dalmatians and Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles the absence of a strong plot-related motivation for the movie has led to complete creative bankruptcy. Perhaps the best decision made by the producers was to aim Dr. Dolittle 2 at children. Since theyre far less discriminating than adults they wont notice the avalanche of problems that will be immediately apparent to every mature movie-goer attracted by the lure of Eddie Murphy and a menagerie of digitally and animatronically enhanced creatures.
