"300 Rise of an Empire Is that your sword or are you just mad to see me? Review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies300 Rise of an Empire Is that your sword or are you just mad to see me? ReviewNot-quite sequel 300 Rise of an Empire takes to the sea for its Greeks vs. Persians action and unveils a new secret weapon against the beefcake hordes women.Eva Green in Rise of an Empire.  (Courtesy of Warner Bros. Picture)  Fri. March 7 2014300 Rise of an EmpireStarring Eva Green Sullivan Stapleton Lena Headey Rodrigo Santoro and Igal Naor. Directed by Noam Murro. At GTA theatres. 102 minutes. 18AA heap of bodies only partially explains the seven-year wait for a follow to 300 Zack Snyders ancient Greek affair in which Gerard Butler and 299 beefcake bros nakedly took on multitudinous Persians with only their swords and sweat. Butlers Spartan King Leonidas and his men achieved ""a beautiful victory"" -- not to mention great box office -- but sadly lost their heads. A prequel seemed the obvious path but then Butler went sitcom soft and Snyder opted for stories of super dudes in leotards. Article Continued BelowSo the mere existence of 300 Rise of an Empire is worthy of note especially the inventive means by which the story has been advanced. Neither prequel nor sequel (maybe we should call it equal) it looks at the other Greeks versus Persians clash that was happening around the same ancient time as 300s Battle of Thermopylae.As any history book (or Google) will tell you this is the aquatic skirmish on the Aegean Sea. The Greeks are once against vastly outnumbered by invading Persians and here we meet the secret weapon of Rise of an Empire women. This highly stylized account drawn as before from a graphic novel by Frank Miller but under the direction this time of Israels Noam Murro has a vibrant lead in Eva Green best known as Bond girl Vesper Lynd from Casino Royale. As Artemisia commander of the Persian navy she dresses Goth but acts Amazon. To say she takes no prisoners is like saying Godzilla doesnt have a calling card. Presented with an unworthy male she summarily beheads him theatrically kisses the severed noggin and then flings it contemptuously away.Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned especially one packing two lethal blades. And although Artemisia is of Greek blood shes seeking payback against her countrymen for the raping and pillaging visited upon her family and town in her childhood and for the killing of Persian King Darius (Igal Naor) the man who rescued her and trained her as a warrior.Darius took a fatal arrow fired by the Greek warrior Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) an event so important to the movie Murro shows us the flashback twice in case we missed the point. (Snyder and his 300 co-writer Kurt Johnstad penned the screenplay.)As fate would have it Themistokles now leads the Greek naval resistance against Persia and Artemisia aims to seduce corrupt and kill him not necessarily in that order. And shes great giving Rise of an Empire some badly needed energy beyond the endless grunting and sepia-toned blood-spilling of the rest of the picture which does manage to make good use of widescreen 3D. Heads split breasts bulge bodies slam and ships collide with authority. The estrogen-enriched production also includes the return of Game of Thrones Lena Headey as Spartan Queen Gorgo aggrieved widow of Leonidas who also swings a mean knife but gets considerably less screen time than Green.Together they help make up for the absence of Butler who is seen only in flashback and for Stapletons serviceable yet unmemorable portrayal of the top Greek seaman. Making even less of an impression apart from a sartorial one is Rodrigo Santoro as returning god-man Xerxes the heavily pierced peacock who watches the action mainly from the sidelines while Artemisia does the heavy lifting. We do get to see how he became a god while visiting a spa but it inspires snickers rather than shudders.None of the men in Rise of an Empire are a match for Artemisias tongue which is sharper than her twin blades. Given the choice between hearing her withering assessment of your sexual prowess or having her shove a sword into your guts you might just go for the sword.

AP AP AP AP AP AP AP AP 300 Rise of an Empire    Director Noam Murro Cast Eva Green Sullivan Stapleton Rodrigo Santoro Rated R (strong sustained sequences of stylized bloody violence throughout a sex scene nudity strong language) Running time 102 min. By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 456pm on Thursday Mar. 13 2014 Thursday Mar. 13 2014 Thursday Mar. 06 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The first 300 director Zack Snyders 2006 take on the legendary showdown between Persians and Spartans at Thermopylae in 480 B.C. was all about the guys and their abs. The sequel 300 Rise of an Empire is more about the women. Specifically seafaring Greek-born Persian warrior Artemisia a figure who -- if this movie is to be believed -- ruled the ancient world through a combination of cunning cruelty and the ability to look great while waging war on the high seas.Its Artemisia played with a mixure of cool and camp by Eva Green ( Dark Shadows Casino Royale) who gives this CGI-saturated sequel a jolt of energy as her male Athenian adversaries are as flavorless as week-old hummus. If not for Artemisia Empire would be just a retread of its predecessor.Set at the same time as the first film when a brave force of 300 men valiantly tried to hold off an invading Persian army led by Xerxes Empire details the sea war between Artemisia and Greek leader Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton). He spends much of his time trying to unite the Greek city-states to thwart the threat. He even travels to Sparta to try to convince Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey reprising her role from the first film) to help him but she wants to handle things on her own.Themistokles turns out to be a tough smart warrior. While the Greeks lack the Persians sheer force of numbers they make up for it in cleverness. So when its Artemesia-vs.-Themistokles crunch time its classic David and Goliath stuff (though unlike here Goliath didnt try to seduce David ending up with one of the most bizarre sex scenes in an action movie ever).Directed by Israeli commercials director Noam Murro and produced by Snyder Empire has the same heavily stylized blood-splattered comic-book visuals as the first film. (Like 300 Empire is based on a Frank Miller graphic novel.) The battle scenes are well-staged even if the 3-D is totally unnecessary. ( Gravity this isnt.)As written by Snyder and Kurt Johnstad Empire is unfortunately low on tongue-in-cheek sword-and-sandal humor though there is a brief shout-out to the Spartacus TV series Peter Mensah who oversaw the gladiator school in that show is seen here as Artemisias combat trainer when she was a young girl cutting her teeth on the hatred of all things Greek. (We learn that though she is Greek herself she loathes them because her family and neighbors were slaughtered by other Greeks.)Stapleton the Australian actor who brought an intensity to his portrayal of a thug in Animal Kingdom acquits himself well in his first big starring role -- he gets to bellow and exhort his followers to battle with the best of them. But theres nothing particularly unique about him here and the same is true for most of his crew. Its up to the Persians -- Artemisia and the evil golden-boy Xerxes (once again played by Rodrigo Santoro) as well as their horrible horde of minions -- to give Empire what bite it has.Artemisia may ultimately have lost the war in this clash of civilizations but she wins our hearts.

The best thing about the new 300 Rise of an Empire is that Zack Snyder didnt direct it. And the worst thing about it is that Zack Snyder didnt direct it. Allow me to explain myself. Back in 2006 Snyders adaptation of Frank Millers comic book 300 a macho reimagining of the battle between a small band of Spartans and the Persian army in Thermopylae made for a most unlikely hit. Sword and sandal movies werent exactly big business but 300 captured something in the culture The Iraq War was raging and the film portrayed the beefy noble Spartan warriors as brave Western heroes holding off a decadent grotesque beyond-Orientalized Persian army. Dont ask me how we managed to see ourselves in the outnumbered outgunned resistance and our scattered and desperate enemy in the massive well-armed invading horde; it was a dark time for everybody. Did Snyder have any real idea of the loaded politics of his filmmaking the hateful equation at the heart of 300? Im not sure He followed 300 up with a literal-minded adaptation of Alan Moores subversive comic book Watchmen. You sensed that like a Chinese tattoo whose translation remains unknown this stuff didnt really mean anything to him It just looked cool. And bro it did look cool. For all its hormonally unbalanced political ideas 300 had a visual purity. Its speed-ramping lateral tracking shots resembled gory 21st-century variations on Eadweard Muybridges studies in motion. Snyder invested this rarefied stylistic conceit with a visceral kick You admired the movement and cringed at the violence even as you held the movie itself at arms length for its stupidity. It worked so well that everybody and his mother has been aping it ever since. (Recently the new Russian movie Stalingrad tried to do for WWII what 300 did for the ancient world. It was kind of ridiculous but Russian audiences apparently ate it up.) That brings us to 300 Rise of an Empire which is an altogether more coherent and less politically convoluted film than 300. This time Snyder serves as producer and co-writer and has turned over directing duties to Israeli director Noam Murro. The result though is a lot less interesting -- its style more anonymous and its macho theatrics more predictable. The film starts where 300 left off -- with a birds-eye view of the Spartans and their King Leonidas lying dead in the wake of Thermopylae. But it then shifts focus to whats happening elsewhere in Greece as the Athenian General Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) prepares for and then fights a massive Persian naval fleet led by the beautiful but ruthless Artemisia (Eva Green) a Greek slave turned Persian general. (By the way nobody actually goes to ""war"" in Rise of an Empire. They all go to something called ""wooooooh."") Along the way the movie flashes forward and backward trying to explain the (made-up) reasons for the Persians second invasion of Greece and filling in all-important details about how the Persian king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) got to be an eight-foot fully shaved golden god. (Answer He walked into a hermits cave there was a pool ... these things happen.) For all those attempts to lend additional context Rise of an Empire actually feels more cartoonish than the original film more eager to indulge in the base pleasures of an action flick. The film has a fantastic ace card in Eva Greens Artemisia -- a magnificently vicious creation an over-the-top badass who slices and dices her way through battle and then makes out with the severed heads of her vanquished enemies. (As the overripe narration tells us ""Her ferocity was bested only by her beauty her beauty matched only by her devotion to her king."") Green the ingenue of Bertoluccis The Dreamers and the Bond girl with a brain from Casino Royale has so much fun with the part that they should do a spinoff movie just about her. As for the battles themselves once again they are highly stylized though in a more humdrum way. Director Murro can speed-ramp like a champ but gone is the level of abstraction that Snyder brought to the original -- and with it much of the visual interest. As our amped-up beefed-up roided-up heroes do their sideways slo-mo somersaults as the limbs and the heads go flying as the thick screen blood splatters the lens like barbecue sauce you may find yourself wondering if that speed-ramping thing can make things go faster. But then every once in a while the movie throws a compelling image at you and youre briefly entranced again a dark horizon filling with ships like plagues of locusts or a vertigo-inducing 3-D shot of Xerxes surveying his massive army from an impossibly high precipice or a harrowing vision of Athens being burned to the ground by the invading Persians. Moments like these and a villain thats hard to resist may be enough to make Rise of an Empire a better movie than 300. But dont be surprised if two weeks from now you forget it ever existed.

Within the first minutes of the film as Leana Headeys Queen Gorgo gives exposition in a clipped Olivier-esque voice we get to see beheadings boobs and bloodspurts; while Persian God-King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) surveys the fallen of Thermopylae from astride his steed we cut for the sight of a horse hoof plunging through a dead human beings face.. We dont get to know any of the people involved in these brutalities and excesses; theyre just presented as part of the films constant designed-to-overwhelm imagery. But pummeling presentation will only go so far; eventually director Noam Murro has to tell us a story as taken from Frank Millers sequel to the original ""300"" graphic novel ""Xerxes."" The script (credited to Zack Snyder director of the first ""300"" and Kurt Johnstad) is the story of what happened while the Spartans were at Thermopylae. With the Persian army delayed by the 300 Spartans Athenian general Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton given so little to do it hurts) leads a rag-tag army of veterans and farmhands and a small fleet of ships against the arriving Persian navy whose fleet spreads from here to the horizon under the baleful command of Artemesia (Eva Green) whose past of tragedy and abuse in Greece has made her a vengeful terror. (Many critics are praising Greens work here as the films standout but being the best slice of ham on a plate full of bloodied raw meat and rot is a matter of contrast not quality.) And theres nothing wrong with the story here; its inspired epic poems and great novels other films and enduring legends. The problem is style or rather Millers style; ""300"" and ""Xerxes"" were originally graphic novels which is what you call ""comic books"" when you know you should be lightly embarrassed by them. Comics are a static medium; the best of them create still images whose power fluidity and impact suggest and imply movement and action. Adapting that illusion to film is tricky and Sam Raimis ""Spider-Man"" films are a great example of how this can happen well. But ""300Rise of an Empire"" like ""300"" simply plays out like a series of violent oil paintings still and lifeless over-created and under-thought. Every time a Greek slashes a Persian with a sword or vice-versa theres a 3D blood-spurt that then in slow-mo or stopped for a moment resembles nothing less than if you were making the punctuation marks for a new font made entirely out of pudding. And its not that this alone is awful boring (although it is); its also that Murro literally has no idea of when to turn this stuff -- notably the slowing-down stopping and then re-accelerating actions better known as ""Speed-ramping"" off. When Themistokles goes to parlay with Artemesia and the negotiations turn into something like a seduction Murro even speed-ramps one of their kisses as if there was a concern that abandoning the one style trick the film knows how to do for even a few moments would frighten the audience. When Themistokles is talking strategy with his fellow soldiers or any other time theres more talking than fighting CGI 3D dust motes or ash particles float in the air presumably so the audience for this film wont be confused by the absence of blood and body parts floating in the air and become concerned their 3D glasses stopped working. But the empty violence and pointless style are only the biggest problems. Much like the Clive Owen-led ""King Arthur"" and the first ""300"" ""300 Rise of an Empire"" shows us Greeks who say mysticism dying but then consult oracles; who say they are working on a glorious idea called ""democracy"" even though Athenian women couldnt vote and Athens had slaves. The need to retrofit modern morals onto ancient civilizations for lazy drama is bad enough but when its done to stack the deck so we can cheer as one side slaughters the other and boo when the dark-skinned foreign invaders gain any advantage is both bad storytelling and a shallow reading of the truths of the past; ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is going to be a thrilling historical epic for people who dont really know what those words actually mean. Long on crimson spurts of blood but low on character larded with production value but bereft of any other kind of it ""300 Rise of an Empire is a 3D joke. Its a not-especially-good FX reel masquerading as a movie a story of brutality and empty violence that cloaks itself in glory and meaning. The story of the Spartans at Thermopylae is a tale of blood battle and bravery that will of course never be forgotten; this film like its predecessor is a tale of banality blood and more blood that is never anything but forgettable.

Print Email Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 06 2014 at 418 PM updated March 06 2014 at 421 PM comments Sing Muse Of the Woods of Holly and the land of angels and that storm-tossed Campari-dark sea from which all the blessings of the gods flow most beloved those that come with international rights and multi-platform merchandising opportunities. For there was once a movie called ""300"" and it told a tale of ancient Sparta when men were men and boys were men and everyone was manly together and so the sad women worshipped Bacchus and book clubs and went antiquing on the Isle of Lesbos. But then came an invasion of mad Persians who wielded fantastic weapons and great wonders riding armies of elephants bearing stores of fine waxes and moisturizers for their torsos were denuded and their faces were like unto a Bieber. And they did battle and the brave Spartans were slaughtered but the storerooms of the Woods of Holly were filled with gold. And there was much rejoicing even to the most junior assistant. And Lo Now comes upon us ""300 Rise of an Empire"" which is both a prequel and a sequel to the original tale only with more bloodspilling and slow-motion and even less wit or truth. For this tale begins with the Battle of Marathon in which Persias King Darius is killed by an arrow from the bow of Themistokles and while Herodotus would rend his garments to hear history so badly spelled and rewritten what does he know from a great opener? So swiftly with the winged feet of Hermes we return to Persia where Darius mourning son Xerxes is transformed by enchantment into some bejeweled creature who calls himself a god-king but looks as if he did lose round one on RuPauls reality show. And Xerxes desires revenge against Athens and so sends his greatest warrior Artemisia for even though she is a beautiful woman she is butch enough for both of them. Yet defeated too she is at first even though offscreen the Spartans are still losing their own battle back in the original ""300"" perhaps in some adjacent amphitheater. So -- let now the final conflict begin Please. But no there is first more manly strutting and posing and voguing about with every chest shaved and oiled and crisscrossed with leather straps until even the oracle of Delphi could not tell if they were going to invade Persia or just that bar down by the docks. And Themistokles who is played by Sullivan Stapleton grimaces mightily as if he were carrying Atlas very burden or maybe trying to pass a stone. And Artemisia whom Eve Green inhabits doffs her breastplate and disports herself in a way unfitting a former Bond Girl not to mention someone who once made a Bertolucci movie. N.J.

And finally our players all voiced of Britannia and buffed by gym do at last meet at the Battle of Salamis which alas is not pronounced the way the movies Teamsters hoped although by the gods that sounds like a good description of this film. And there is much grinding of teeth and mauling of history and anachronistic use of gunpowder until we plug our ears and desperately pray to the gods of Olympus or the brothers of Warner that they might make an end. But they do not for many eons. And now that they have and the films entrails are spread before us as if at a divination or the lunch spread at that deli downtown with the nice stuffed derma what more can we make of it? What lessons can we take from its gleeful xenophobia nudity violence and gore? That if it makes enough drachmas not all the sons and daughters of Zeus can save us from another.

Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Warner Bros. Pictures 300 Rise of an Empire Director Noam Murro Genre Action fantasy Running time 102 minutes Rated R; graphic violence sex scene partial nudity profanity With Sullivan Stapleton Eva Green Lena Headey Talk about meeting cute The first time theyre alone together the protagonists of 300 Rise of an Empire rip each others clothes off. But then Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) and Artemisia (Eva Green) cant decide if they want to make love or war. The other characters in this movie a superstylized battle epic that doubles as an Samp;M comedy suffer no such confusion. Theyre all primed to mangle skewer and dismember each other generally at angles that send red-black CGI blood spurting directly at 3-D-specs-wearing viewers. Its an effect that soon becomes numbing -- but then so does everything else in Israeli director Noam Murros drab repetitive sequel to 2006s 300. Actually Rise of an Empire isnt exactly a sequel; its more of a simul-quel since most of the action takes place at the same time as the battle in the earlier film. While those 300 Spartans fight invading Persians on land Athens-born Themistokles leads a Greek-coalition fleet against a much larger Persian armada. Themistokles it turns out is the guy who took out Darius the Persian king who led a failed assault on Greece 10 years earlier. So Darius brooding son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) seems to crave vengeance against the Athenian although its hard to tell for sure. The way he struts around -- gleaming pierced and nearly naked -- it appears that what Xerxes really wants is to be on the cover of LUomo Vogue. Luckily the Persian king can count on Artemisia who shares his goth-punk fashion sense but is much more focused on combat. She leads repeated sallies against the Greeks and never seems happier than when fighting one-on-one with implements that elicit what she calls ""the ecstasy of steel and flesh."" Other turn-ons leather breastplates setting things on fire and slaying ineffective subordinates. Rise of an Empire has such a thing for decapitations that severed noggins become almost routine but only Artemisia thinks to lift a freshly separated head and kiss it on the lips. No wonder Greens character is the films most memorable and loads more fun than Stapletons earnest Themistokles. Random scraps of this scenario are historically true. There really was an Artemisia although the backstory the movie provides is fiction. Also genuine is Spartas Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) who serves as the narrator. Its unlikely however that either woman resembled a Marvel Comics superheroine quite so much as they do here. Co-written by 300 director Zach Snyder the script is based on Frank Millers unfinished graphic novel Xerxes which draws on Hellenistic writer Herodotus (aka ""the father of lies""). The characterization of the democratic Greeks (noble and scarred bearded but chest-waxed) and the theocratic Persians (proto-Nazi berserkers dressed by Lady Gaga) is sheer nonsense. Not that anyone should expect realism from an ancient-world war epic whose look and feel are utterly contemporary. Although the actors are less digitally altered than in 300 the movie relies heavily on computer-generated backdrops effects and ""camera movements."" And its overamplified wounds blows and cries are woven into a score by Dutch electronicist Junkie XL. If the movies action recalls video games the dramatically artificial lighting suggests 1980s rock videos. Indeed Rise of an Empire is so campy that it might work better as a musical. All those topless Greek hunks could sing ""Im too sexy for my shirt"" and Artemisia could share a duet with a severed head. ""It Aint Me Babe"" might work.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 07 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Mar. 07 2014 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Noam Murro Written by Zack Snyder and Kurt Johnstad Starring Sullivan Stapleton and Eva Green Classification 18A Country USA Language English In 300 Rise of an Empire Eva Green commands a navy and bares her navel with equal aplomb. Cast as Artemisia a Greek orphan adopted by the Persian conqueror King Darius (Igal Naor) - and thus the de facto stepsister to his sociopath-in-waiting son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro - Green revels in her warrior-woman character and her wardrobe including some spiky body armour that makes her look like a sexy stegosaurus. Because Artemisia is on the wrong side of a brutal campaign being waged against her countrymen by the now-grown Xerxes she is ostensibly the films villainess and plenty of Greeks die by her nimble hand. But Greens reckless abandon in the part makes it hard to root against her. Shes definitely more appealing than our nominal hero the bearded Greek general Themistokles played by the young Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton. In the original 300 Gerard Butler cut a kingly figure as the Spartan leader Leonidas but Stapleton doesnt quite have enough cartoon-brute presence to carry the day. In fact fans of 300 might sit hoping for a cameo from Butler considering that the story here takes place mostly concurrently with the events of the first film. Its being marketed as a sequel but Rise of an Empire is more accurately described as an extension of the 300 universe like an add-on content pack for a video game.Taking over in the directors chair for Zack Snyder Noam Murro utilizes a similarly video-game-esque visual scheme all digitally assisted tracking shots teeming battlefield tableaus and spurting carotid arteries. This Xbox aesthetic was at least somewhat unique when 300 came out in 2006 but seven years worth of slicked-up sword-and-sandal epics has diminished its novelty significantly. At least one large-scale battle sequence set aboard a flaming wooden ship and climaxing with the surreal sight of sea serpents snacking on the capsized casualties has a certain loony grandeur but Murro doesnt have Snyders talent for either violence or velocity even as he keeps doubling down on both.Critics who called out 300s underlying political allegory - the democratic West staving off the Middle Eastern barbarians at the gate - will find more of the same here as will those who giggled at the original films homoeroticism find plenty more well-oiled torsos and basso-voiced speeches about brotherhood and honour. At the same time Murro does his best to play up the lustful dynamic between Artemisia and Themistokles whose mutual respect for the others military tactics masks a palpable attraction. By throwing herself headfirst into scenes that a more cautious actress might beg off Green earns herself a citation for valour - a Purple Heart in a movie thats otherwise way too grim and grey for its own good.Special to The Globe and Mail Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments AA In the know Report on Business In tough job market highly educated feel the squeeze Report on Pokemon Canadians love it a Pokemaster is crowned Werner Herzog is puzzled News How a Dudes Club in Vancouver is helping homeless men feel human again Life How do I keep peace in the family when money comes up?

Credit Warner Brothers Pictures Classical historians disagree but it was probably Herodotus who first posed a question that would ring out across the ages unanswered till now Wouldnt Eva Green look awesome kissing the severed head of an insolent captive? ""300 Rise of an Empire"" puts the issue to rest (the answer yes but itll never last) and strives to uphold the rah-rah style of visuals and rhetoric established by its popular predecessor ""300.""Greece -- or its tightly rendered color-constrained graphic equivalent -- is again in danger but the battles in this contemporary sequel center on the sea. Free city-states are mustering a defense against the Persian invaders and their myriad ships under ever-darkening prospects (and skies).Unlike the death-cult Spartans led to war in the earlier film by Gerard Butler in a performance that unleashed a thousand meme variations this motley crew of slightly less chiseled Greeks follows the less inspiring or at any rate less shouty Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton of ""Gangster Squad"" and the TV show ""Strike Back"").The hacking and impalement of ancient combat still yield gore that defies gravity and invites our delectation in the obligatory money-shot slow-motion. But the bigger mortal threat to manliness lies in the Persians vicious naval commander Artemisia (Ms. Green) impossibly willowy and virtually dripping black like an Aubrey Beardsley drawing.A Greek who suffered horrifically at the hands of warring countrymen shes revealed as the eminence grise behind Xerxes (swaggeringly reprised by Rodrigo Santoro) though Ms. Green sometimes suggests cruel hauteur more often than she puts it across. Meanwhile the Persian emperors origin story -- his transformation into a bejeweled manscaped god-king -- is revealed in a process evoking a brisk dip in molten gold. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The naval collisions and melees play out in panel-like renderings that are bold and satisfying for the first half-hour but lack the momentum and bombastic je ne sais quoi of ""300."" Someone was also apparently worried that the films depth of field wouldnt come across judging from the ubiquitous particles suspended in the air as if some unseen Greek had just dusted. (The director Noam Murro who has primarily specialized in commercials took over from Zack Snyder this time. Mr. Snyder wrote the screenplay with Kurt Johnstad from Frank Millers graphic novel ""Xerxes."")Strategically speaking the Greeks underdog maneuvers work until they dont while the Persians are unstoppable until they arent. Themistokles supplies a politicians skeptical perspective on the Spartans while a brave father-son duo serve to personalize the notion of self-sacrifice with regular check-ins.It might also be added that the film arrives at a somewhat different less freshly besieged era than ""300"" released in 2007. But the political climate might matter less than the over-the-top example of faux period excess provided by several seasons of ""Game of Thrones.""That shows bedroom maneuvers might have influenced a pivotal scene in which the long rivalrous gazes across the sea between Themistokles and Artemisia lead to their finally getting a room. In the telling aftermath the ruthless Persian commander is more or less recast as a woman scorned ultimately leaving Greece and everyones machismo mostly intact.""300 Rise of an Empire"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sustained sequences of stylized bloody violence; a sex scene; and some strong language.

Grade C+ Asked if ""300 Rise of an Empire"" should be called a sequel or a prequel to 300 the filmmakers called it ""an equal."" Its more like a replica - or with its alternately glittering and rusty look a carbon copy typed on yellow paper with several pages set ablaze. Once again we get an imperial Persia vs. free Greece story line with gut-splattering action and high-flown rhetoric. ""Better we show them we chose to die on our feet rather than live on our knees"" says the Greek leader Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton). Once again the moviemakers fill the screen with scantily clad warriors though compared with the Spartan fighters in ""300"" the abs on Themistokles Athenian sailors are six-pack Lite. The one prize addition is Artemisia the Persian naval commander played by the gleaming-eyed Eva Green with a palpable sexual bloodlust. Swinging her oversized battleships against the Athenians relatively tiny wooden fleet she falls into love-hate - or hate-love - with the wily Themistokles via spyglass. She calls an abrupt powwow so they can engage in brutal sex. They approach satisfaction only when they literally cross blades. Director Noam Murro and screenwriter Kurt Johnstad adapting an unfinished graphic novel by Frank Miller swiftly link Themistokles to the Persian god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). In this mythic history Themistokles killed Xerxes dad at the Battle of Marathon 10 years earlier. The filmmakers depict Xerxes transformation from mortal to divinity as a monstrous vision quest then connect the naval battles he initiates at Artemisium and Salamis to the land battle at Thermopylae where 300 Spartans delay the Persian hordes. Themistokles sly defensive tactics are impressive whether hes gathering his ships into a coil that looks like a snail-shell or luring the Persians into a fogbank. But ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is more depleting than energizing. Murro combines harrowing pyrotechnics with savage hand-to-hand combat in the franchise style that crosses horror comics with ""Classics Illustrated."" The slow-mo spurts of blood make every slash instantly comprehensible - and increasingly repetitive. You tire of being pulled by your viscera. Murro thinks hes contrasting the fascist sensibility of the empire-building Persians with the freedom-loving temperament of the Athenians. He describes his vision of the Persian capital Persepolis as ""Albert Speer meets Dolce amp; Gabbana."" But in this hot-wired spectacle the only good look we get of Athens comes when its in flames. Murro may believe that hes directed an anti-fascist movie but what hes really made is almost as coercive as fascist melodrama. Its a big bully of an action film.

Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic As much performance art as movie ""300 Rise of an Empire"" unfolds as beautiful bloody slow-motion machismo. Torsos bared swords flashing another 300 rock the leather skirts and loincloths with pounding passionate music perfectly underscoring this latest round of the ""beautiful death"" the ancient Greeks were so poetic about.Though it is hard to replicate the freshness of the first ""Rise"" is almost as visually stunning as 2006s ""300"" when Gerard Butler as King Leonidas sacrificed Spartas finest abs in a no-win battle against the Persian god-king Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). This time there is more to it than scantily clad men mud wrestling to hone their battle skills. A female demands the right to bear arms and bare breasts. Artemisia (Eva Green) is as fierce and brave as any man and shes dressed to kill. Zack Snyder who directed the first remains a guiding force in ""Rise"" writing the script with Kurt Johnstad. Director Noam Murro continues the arresting design ethos of ""300"" which took its visual cues from graphic novelist Frank Miller on whose work the films are based. The freeze-framing of blood spurting and heads rolling is amped up significantly allowing much more time for the audience to absorb -- appreciate? -- the gore.BEST MOVIES OF 2013 Turan | Sharkey | Olsen Based on another story idea from Miller ""Rise"" picks a different battle that unfolds around the same time as ""300s"" Thermopylae clash at the Hot Gates. This one is by sea and led by the slightly less buff but more philosophical Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) an Athenian naval general and part-time politician.Xerxes is technically still the nemesis. We get a look at his before-and-after how a trip to an evil spa in the mountains turned him into Persias golden boy with shimmery skin impressive piercings and to-die-for bling. But Xerxes is more of a poser in ""Rise"" often asked to look god-like at a discreet distance.The one to watch is Artemisia and not just because Green gets the best costumes -- leather and chainmail has rarely been as fetching -- but because her character is as tactical a warrior as Themistokles and she has a grudge to match.Some of the ""300"" are back for ""Rise"" most notably Leonidas wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey). She is also the films narrator making sure we dont get confused with all the Thems and Therms. That a narrator is necessary to walk us through the complexities might suggest theres a problem with the script. There is. For all of its hyper-realized visuals ""Rise of an Empire"" is a very talkie film. The Queen not only explains Themistokles push for a unification of the Greek city-states but Spartas isolationists stance Persias desire for dominance Artemisias difficult Greek adolescence her unexpected allegiance to Persian King Darius King Darius death Xerxes rise. And I havent even mentioned all the ruminations on fathers and sons the price of democracy the pain of war etc. etc. etc.PHOTOS Box office top 10 of 2013 | Biggest flops of 2013Its not that Headey isnt a fine storyteller; the actress is actually quite good at bringing Greek mythology to life. But the film relies on her so much that it is sometimes a shock when a character actually speaks. And sometimes when they do speak you understand why the filmmaker keeps turning to Headey. A particularly embarrassing democracy debate comes to mind -- in addition to its windy pontificating Themistokles and his cohorts are put in red togas which are frankly not flattering in any light.Fortunately Themistokles regains his manhood by the time he is needed for the sex scene with Artemisia. Fueled by his-and-her rage that quickly leads to the ripping of clothes and some serious sword play along with the foreplay the scene represents a high or low depending on your point of view.Still you couldnt ask for a more magnetic villain than Green whose fight choreography is incredible. Opposite that force field Stapleton is not quite as commanding. Hes better on his own with his men on the high seas.Those skirmishes are truly a tribute to the power of visual effects the skill of cinematographer Simon Duggan and production designer Patrick Tatopoulos creative reinvention of period details.The spectacularly brutal fighting is the films main calling card and in that ""Rise of an Empire"" doesnt disappoint. Still in the battle for best guilty pleasure Id give it to the Spartans of ""300"" by a head.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com -----------------------------300 Rise of an EmpireMPAA rating R for strong sustained sequences of stylized bloody violence throughout a sex scene nudity and some languageRunning time 1 hour 42 minutes Playing In general releaseMORE ON LOCATION People and places behind whats onscreen PHOTOS Biggest box office flops of 2013 PHOTOS Celebrity production companies Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews 300 (movie) Lena Headey Eva Green Interior Policy On the Set Movies and TV 300 Rise of an Empire likely to top Peabody amp; Sherman 300 Rise of an Empire trailer spotlights Eva Greens Artemisia Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad81deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-300-rise-movie-review-20140307,0,18039.story#axzz2vDXLviEI",200,300riseofanempire11,300riseofanempire,latimes

The 300 sequel is beautiful and bloody.Sullivan Stapleton stars as Themistokles in ""300 Rise of an Empire.""(Photo Clay Enos Warner Bros. Pictures)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY review  out of fourStars Sullivan Stapleton Eva Green Lena Headey Rodrigo SantoroRated R; Runtime 1 hour 43 minutes; opens nationwide FridayRome wasnt built in a day but this sword-and-sandals sequel may have been.Stunningly shot and stupidly written 300 Rise of an Empire ( out of four rated R opens nationwide Friday) has all the visual style and arterial spray of its predecessor Zack Snyders 300.But even that stilted dialogue is Fellini-esque compared with Empire whose wacky take on Greek history wont bother action fanatics. But for anyone looking for a sense of script (forget plausibility) Empire is a Trojan horse.Sullivan Stapleton (Gangster Squad the British TV series Strike Back) plays Themistokles the real-life Athenian general who would lead the Greek military against Persian forces around 480 B.C.Empire begins promisingly with the ferocious battle of Marathon and the introduction of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) the Persian king who would later defeat the 300 Spartans of Snyders tale.STORY Eva Green conquers 300 Rise of an EmpireMORE Lena Headey is the glue holding 300 to its sequelREVIEWS The latest reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersBut the scene underscores Empires struggle. While its beautiful and bloody Empire paints its villains -- Xerxes and his lieutenant the beautiful and deadly naval commander Artemisia (Eva Green) -- as far more interesting than their heroic Greek counterparts. Xerxes watches his father die and swears revenge on Greece; Artemisia is Greek but watched her family die at the hands of Greek soldiers and switched allegiances.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare 300 Rise of an Empire picks up not long after 300 left off as Xerxes the Great of Persia battles the Greeks to avenge his father Darius death and become a god. Their stories dwarf those of Themistokles and his blandly benevolent comrades a father-son soldier combo and the sulking Spartan Queen Gorgo (one of the few returning players in Lena Headey).Our heroes are swarthy and buff (you know who to root for because the bad guys wear clothes) but they have little to say beyond renditions of ""Id rather die on my feet than live on my knees"" And a scene in which Themistokles and Artemisia meet to broker peace but instead break into rough sex draws the necessary R rating -- and unintentional laughs.Director Noam Murro (Smart People) tries to infuse Empire with a David-vs.-Goliath worldview similar to 300s. And credit Empire with giving its actresses substantial action roles. But this film telegraphs its punches like a sword to the eyeball.And there are plenty. Empire promises and delivers a literal tide of blood which will be welcome news for action aficionados looking for a picture that pulls no punches. But for fans of story Empire throws none. 108 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1cee3uV",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/03/06/300-rise-of-an-empire-review/5807971/,200,300riseofanempire12,300riseofanempire,usatoday

Comments click to enlarge 300 Rise of an Empire Video Rated R  103 minutes  2014 History becomes a vulgar spectacle in this ultraviolent actioner about the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Battle of Artemisium. An Athenian general (Sullivan Stapleton) leads his muscle-bound countrymen against an evil king (Rodrigo Santoro) and the vast army led by his buxom second in command (Eva Green) a foul temptress with a murderous streak. The slow-motion battle scenes are technically impressive and occasionally elegant but theres enough machismo here to choke a thousand NFL locker rooms; thank cowriters Zack Snyder (who directed the original 300) and Kurt Johnstand for the rampant homophobia and chauvinism. In one scene Green and Stapleton meet to discuss a possible truce but wind up trying to out-fuck each other in a display of carnal superiority; she eventually succumbs to his uh will.

Stephanie Merry writes ""Ice Age Collision Course"" the fifth installment in the 14-year-long saga of animated prehistoric animals will with any luck also be the last. Lazy scattershot and excruciatingly unfunny the movie is a hazard to the very young who might come away with the erroneous impression that movies dont get any better than this."" Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. By Ann Hornaday March 6 2014 Follow AnnHornaday Gazing at actor Michael Fassbenders fine tuxedoed self as he celebrated ""12 Years a Slaves"" historic win at the Academy Awards earlier this week it was hard to believe that seven years had gone by since we first met the dreamy Irish actor when he played a brave Spartan soldier in the cult pulp classic ""300."" In that film director Zack Snyder put his bombastic gifts to use in bringing ancient Greece if not to life then to some kind of mesmerizingly bizarro synthetic version thereof. A super-stylized mashup of graphic novel narrative and video-game stagecraft ""300"" was a huge hit launching Fassbender into much finer things (including a longtime collaboration with director Steve McQueen) and star Gerard Butler into a Dante-esque limbo of forgettable rom-coms and middling action flicks. ""300 Rise of an Empire"" isnt a sequel to ""300"" as much as a parallel-quel catching up with the Athenian-led Grecian forces at the same time that ""300s"" King Leonidas and his Spartans are getting their toned tushies kicked at Thermopylae. While no big stars are likely to emerge from the speechifying and gruesome swordplay of this installment the film does feature at least one genuinely memorable performance by Eva Green here playing Persian naval genius Artemisia with such gothic bloodlust that the only things shes missing are fangs and a coffin to sleep in. In ""Rise of an Empire"" Artemisia has been sent by Persian god-king Xerxes (a blinged-out Rodrigo Santoro) to defeat Greece and avenge the death of Xerxess father Darius at the hands of the soldier Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton). Suffice it to say things dont go exactly according to plan. Based on a still-to-be-published graphic novel by Frank Miller ""Rise of an Empire"" has been adapted by Israeli commercial director Noam Murro with alternately crude and canny fealty to Snyders hyperventilating original A series of smashing crashing seafaring set pieces interrupted by variations on Henry Vs Crispins Day speech (or maybe the ""Gentlemen to bed"" gag from Steve Coogans ""The Trip"") this chapter is a dull monochromatic affair its dingy gray palette barely enlivened by syrupy blood that spurts squirts and gushes with metronomic regularity. When the film isnt sloppily directed its a series of lazy filmmaking tics including fetishistic slow-motion shots of blood water and sweat as well as sundry dismemberments impalings and decapitations. It sounds like a blast doesnt it? But ""Rise of an Empire"" is no fun at all -- even those famous six-pack abs from ""300"" seem to be missing a can or two in this desperate attempt to up an already dubious ante. Despite a visibly sincere effort Stapleton is a non-starter as the brave Athenian trying to unite the city-states of Greece in defending their experiment in democracy. His supporting players are little more than an anonymous tableau of shirtless grunting dude-itude. Oddly for a franchise founded on the bedrock of man flesh and macho posturing its the women of ""Rise of an Empire"" who make the most impact Lena Headey as Spartan Queen Gorgo makes serious focused use of her lamentably limited time on screen and Green rips into her ruthless anti-heroine with throaty gusto not to mention an endless supply of beautifully draped leather and chain mail. (Who knew Persian barges boasted that much closet space?) Despite its comic-book sensibilities ""Rise of an Empire"" is anything but family-friendly. In addition to its steady stream of gloppy bloodletting the film includes aggressive sexuality that borders on the perverse including a ludicrous scene of carnal passion below decks and a startling moment of intimacy between a key character and a disembodied head. How do you follow a scene like that? ""Rise of an Empire"" makes an attempt but it only looks sillier the harder it tries.  R. At area theaters. Contains strong sustained sequences of stylized bloody violence throughout a sex scene nudity and some strong language. 102 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

Photo Credit AP / Warner Bros. Pictures advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Greeks battle Persians in a follow-up to the 2007 blockbuster ""300."" Rated R (extreme battle violence sexual content) BOTTOM LINE Battle porn for undiscerning viewers. CAST Sullivan Stapleton Eva Green Lena Headey LENGTH 142 Way back in 2007 Zack Snyders ""300"" hit screens like the blood-spray from a freshly sliced jugular. The story of 300 Spartans who held back the Persians at Thermopylae the movie was a highly stylized orgy of violence filled with bare-chested male warriors writhing in crimson gore. It was battle porn basically and like most porn it made money earning 456 million worldwide. Compared to the new follow-up ""300 Rise of an Empire"" the first movie feels positively quaint. To stretch the porn analogy the old ""300"" now looks like a reel from the 1970s with its endearing attempts at story and character while ""Rise of an Empire"" is the kind of stuff that sweaty teenagers now consume via broadband a plotless montage of anonymous bodies. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Messing Shelton call truce after spat over Trump Matt Damon says hes taking a year-long acting break Some fans of ""300"" might consider that good news though surely even they can spot a knock-off. For starters the first films enjoyably overpumped star Gerard Butler (as King Leonidas) is gone leaving his widow Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) to help deliver the rousing speeches. The Persian king Xerxes memorably played by Rodrigo Santoro as a kind of antiquity-era RuPaul with facial piercings and a swinging codpiece has been reduced to a bit part. Our hero is now Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton ""Gangster Squad"") a generic Greek general who shifts the battlefield from land to sea. Directed not by Snyder (who co-wrote the screenplay) but by a hardworking impersonator Noam Murro ""Rise of an Empire"" seems to be overcompensating for something. Heads are severed mouths stabbed women raped all of it captured in pleasure-lengthening slow-motion and smeared with thick digital blood. Murro goes overboard when adding depth to the 3-D field filling the atmosphere with so much floating virtual crud -- dust motes campfire sparks pollen -- that it distracts from his already overwhelmed actors. The one bright spot is Eva Green as Xerxes machinator Artemesia a raccoon-eyed warrior princess. Just as she did in Tim Burtons ""Dark Shadows"" Green plays a snarling insatiable self-hating femme fatale and completely steals the show. (If some sharp director ever reattempts Ayn Rands ""The Fountainhead"" Green would make a perfect Dominique Francon.) Even Green however cant save ""300 Rise of an Empire."" It feels like a Vine video version of a feature film. 231 Movies300 Rise of an Empire trailer PLOT Greeks battle Persians in a follow-up to the 2007 blockbuster ""300."" advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (extreme battle violence sexual content) CAST Sullivan Stapleton Eva Green Lena Headey LENGTH 142 BOTTOM LINE Battle porn for undiscerning viewers.

March 6 2014 -- 240pm Sullivan Stapleton in ""300 Rise of an Empire"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert ""300 Rise of an Empire"" plays like a collaboration between the Marquis de Sade and Michael Bay. Or maybe the History Channel and the ""Saw"" franchise. Catering to audiences that savor chest-thumping machismo in-your-face eruptions of blood and hyper-pumped male musculature fetishized in slo-mo its unlike anything else in theaters today. Thank goodness. Fans of Zack Snyders 2007 hit ""300"" will see some familiar faces. Rodrigo Santoro returns as the bald bling-bedecked Persian god-king Xerxes with Lena Headey as the warlike Spartan queen Gorgo and even a cameo by Gerard Butler as her late husband Leonidas who fell in the battle of Thermopylae defending Greece from eastern hordes. Yes theres a walk-on by a deceased character because this not-a-prequel not-a-sequel jumbles in events before during and after the first films timeline. This chapter moves the conflict to sea battles with Greek general Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) laboring to rally his homelands divided kingdoms against their common enemy the Persians. His nemesis is Artemisia (Eva Green) a Greek turncoat who commands Xerxes fleet. The films dramatic center of gravity is off-balance with the fearsome/repellent Xerxes on the sidelines and Artemisia pursuing personal revenge through military means. Stapleton is utterly colorless especially in contrast to Butler who bellowed his lines like a boss. Green is the films dynamo a villainess with electric eyes and a rumbling husky voice who is equally brutal and bonkers. She rains scorn and destruction on her enemies and French-kisses an enemys decapitated head. Shes one of those black hats like Loki Anton Chigurh or Hannibal Lecter who steal the movie. Snyders hand is evident here as a co-writer and producer with Noam Murro handling the directing duties. He was apparently chosen for his ability to mimic the look and feel of the original. Again we have constant dramatic digitally created storm clouds imparting a look of Scandinavian gloom to famously sunny Greece. There are repeated low-angle shots of muscleman actors as if the camera is kneeling worshipfully before them. The action sequences are ostentatious tidal waves of amputation and disembowelment replicating the look of the Frank Miller graphic novels that inspired the movies. Say what you will about the dubious content this is a technically and visually impressive piece of craftsmanship. Disturbingly the film gives Snyder another forum to explore his fascination with hate-sex. For all the violence onscreen nothing tops the punishing scene of rage and intercourse between Artemisia and Themistokles as she connives to make him switch sides. The episode echoes queasy episodes of fury and coitus in Snyders ""Watchmen"" and ""Sucker Punch."" Hes the rape-iest major moviemaker working today. In the climactic duel Artemisia belittles Themistokles lovemaking performance before he decisively shows her who has the bigger sword. Snyder would be better served sharing those fantasies with a professional than with the impressionable young male audiences his films attract. Warner Bros. Sullivan Stapleton is Themistokles. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 6 2014 201 PM Title 300 Rise of an Empire Film Info R Graphic violence sex nudity language. Area theaters. In IMAX and 3-D where available. In the annals of crazy-bad movie sequels theres a special place for those whose stories take place concurrent with those in the original better movies. You know the stories that werent important enough to tell the first time out. The perfect example is ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"" from 1979 a film that shows there was a second less interesting group of seafaring-disaster survivors also trying to make their way out of the upside-down ocean liner. Now comes ""300 Rise of an Empire"" which picks up from the 2006 original with similar results. History tells us that while King Leonides was leading his valiant 300 to certain death against Persia at Thermopylae in 480 B.C. another simultaneous conflict was happening at sea. Eva Green plays strong-willed Queen Artemisia. In the Battle of Artemisium the villainous Persian Xerxes intended to smash the Greek city-states with massive naval might. So it is told here. Ah but theres a catch The Greek general Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) is every bit as fierce as Leonides (played by Gerard Butler in ""300"") if slightly less hairy. His brute magnetism does inspire cunning Queen Artemisia (Eva Green) to make that classic villain offer Join her and rule side by side She makes this offer in the form of a violent coupling -- its not exactly side by side though pretty much every other side is taken care of. The Spartans are ready for battle again in 300. Themistokles pledged to fight for Greeces Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) wont leave his men. Many graphic stabbings spearings and fiery explosions later Xerxes proves what any wrongdoer knows Dont mess with a guy with two Xs in his name. The first ""300"" directed by Zack Snyder from a Frank Miller graphic novel had a semi-animated look that set it apart. ""Rise of an Empire"" director Noam Murro copies that visual palette but the film winds up looking like an ashen video game. Its even more muddy in IMAX and 3-D. The bare-chested actors are forgettable including returning baddie Rodrigo Santoro as Xerxes who looks like a life-size Oscar statuette from a disco-obsessed planet. Rodrigo Santoro plays Xerxes the baddest Persian cat around. The only saving grace is Green the reigning witch-queen of cinema. The smoky-eyed French actress best known for ""Casino Royale"" ""The Golden Compass"" and ""Dark Shadows"" throws her all into the performance going bare-chested at times bared-teeth at others. Shes like Elizabeth Taylors Cleopatra possessed by a succubus -- which is a good thing. Without her ""300 Rise of an Empire"" would be bloodless and brainless. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" Thurs. - Sun. throughout the day on New Yorks WOR-710 AM and at wor710.com.

Starring Eva Green Sullivan Stapleton and Rodrigo Santoro. Directed by Noam Murro. (R. 102 minutes.) ""300"" was an innovative and imaginative action film but the follow-up ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is nothing but a disappointment. Zack Snyder directed the original but the new entry is directed by Noam Murro whose only previous feature was about an emotionally repressed English professor (""Smart People""). And no - a sequel to ""300"" is no place to get started as an action-movie director. Like the best of Snyders work ""300"" wasnt all about action. There were subtleties in the performances that suggested an entire distant culture in this case the warrior culture of ancient Sparta. The movies muted colors and Snyders use of a digital rose-petal effect instead of blood in the battle scenes evoked the storys origins as a graphic novel while suggesting something far away as though we were seeing not the events themselves but their memory. But as is often the case with a novice action director Murro overcompensates for his inexperience. Trying to out-Zack Zack he replaces Snyders rose petals with gushes of blood and muted colors with murk. ""300 Rise of an Empire"" becomes a succession of battle scenes filmed in tight medium shots so that all you see is commotion. If you want to know whos winning the only way to tell is to see which general is smiling. More movie reviews Visitors Static film isnt for everyone Bethlehem Powerful film on Israelis Palestinians The Rocket Tragedy balanced with triumph Mr. Peabody amp; Sherman Worthwhile trip back in time The Lunchbox A lush if frustrating food affair The movies one genuine point of interest is perverse and thats Eva Greens performance as the evil Artemisia the naval commander heading the Persian attack on the Greek city states. With her black hair pale white skin and murderous ways she looks like the women in Edvard Munchs lithographs and acts like a vampiric femme fatale of the early 20th century. A caricature Its curious that a misogynistic stereotype from a century ago could still be offered to the public as an example of strong powerful womanhood. (If you punch a woman in the face is it a feminist statement to show that she can take it?) Green is fun to watch - she always is - but theres a point at which the caricature becomes the career and that point is drawing closer. Still its hard not to enjoy the absurd spectacle of Artemisias person-to-person meeting with her Greek counterpart the Athenian general Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton). A tense peace conference turns into an interlude of scary sex in which the two blast through six positions within 30 seconds banging into walls and slamming into tables looking like theyre trying to kill each other - but no theyre not doing that not yet. Later Artemisia implies that Themistokles lovemaking was too soft. If it were any harder theyd have to put a hole through the wall. ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller called ""Xerxes"" after the Persian king. The movie is not strictly speaking a sequel to ""300"" in that it covers events concurrent with the previous film. ""300"" showed the land battle in which 300 Greeks attempted to stop a massive Persian army at Thermopylae. ""Rise of an Empire"" shows the sea battle happening at around the same time. Setup is a letdown On the one side theres Themistokles trying to forge a legion of Greek states and getting trouble from Lena Headey reprising her role as Spartas Queen Gorgo. Unfortunately this movies effort to convey the life and mentality of ancient Greece is perfunctory and so her role is simplified from that of someone emblematic of a cultural mind-set to someone whos merely tough by nature. Likewise unaided by the director Sullivan Stapleton as Themistokles has none of the complication and mystery that Gerard Butler had in the earlier film. Hes just a generic hero so noble that he doesnt quite appreciate Eva Greens allure as much as he should. In the end if ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is not technically a sequel its a sequel in spirit - an attempt to do something a second time but with none of the same feeling inspiration or vision. At one point Themistokles tries to inspire his troops and we sit back and expect some statement that might give us a glimpse of this earlier time. Instead he talks about how soldiers dont fight for a cause but simply for the guy next to them. Thats something you hear all the time and can know - and put in a characters mouth - without having ever been in battle. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"300 Rise of an Empire | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; 300-rise-of-an-empire ) 300 Rise of an Empire (United States 2014) March 05 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli 300 Rise of an Empire is one of those unnecessary sequels that exists primarily because the previous installment made a lot of money. The lack of a creative driver behind the film leads to a level of fundamental dissatisfaction. The movie delivers all the necessary elements but their impact is dull. The virulent mix of adrenaline and testosterone that fueled 2006as 300 accomplishing the increasingly difficult task of getting young adult males into theaters is diluted in 300 Rise of an Empire. Thereas a sense that screenwriters Zack Snyder (who directed the original) amp; Kurt Johnstad and director Noam Murro sat down and came up with a list of things that made 300 popular. Over-the-top violence - check. Spurting blood - check. Frequent beheadings - check. Six-pack abs - check. Topless women - check. Big special effects-fueled battles - check. Rousing speeches - check. Those elements which formed the cornerstones of 300 are all present in 300 Rise of an Empire. But thereas something missing the energy and sense of envelope-pushing. More than anything this new movie feels calculated. In 300 the stylistic aspects worked in the service of presenting the narrative. In 300 Rise of an Empire itas the other way around. The storyline is constructed to highlight the visual and visceral components and thatas why it doesnat work nearly as well. Part of 300 Rise of an Empire is a prequel part takes place during the same time frame as its predecessor (but in a different location) and the final act advances the story beyond the end of 300. With King Leonidas dead a new hero is needed. This comes in the person of Themistocles of Athens (Sullivan Stapleton) who is credited with killing King Darius of Persia during the first attempted invasion of Greece. This allows Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to ascend to the throne and with the able assistance of his chief naval warrior Artemisia (Eva Green) he claims the title of agod king.a While Xerxes is beginning his attack on Thermopylae he sends Artemisia and her fleet against the small navy commanded by Themistocles. Before engaging the enemy he seeks support from Queen Gorgo of Sparta (Lena Headey) but his efforts are rebuffed. As a result of necessity his attack on the much larger Persian force requires more guile than brute force. After winning two battles Themistocles finds himself in an untenable position where victory no longer appears to be an option. In 300 the largest character by far was Leonidas and his absence in the sequel is keenly felt. (Initially it was planned for Leonidas to make appearances but Gerald Butler wasnat interested in reprising the role.) Sullivan Stapletonas Themistocles is a poor substitute. The character is mundane and his speeches lack the fire-and-brimstone of Leonidasa pep talks. The most colorful member of 300 Rise of an Empireas roster is Artemisia. Unfortunately sheas a villain and is therefore not permitted to capture our sympathies despite having a tragic backstory. Eva Green plays her like a Frank Frazetta warrior woman come to life. Rodrigo Santoroas Xerxes might have been an imposing abig bada if permitted more screen time. As it is heas only around for a few minutes at the beginning and a few more at the end. For the most part heas too busy wiping out Leonidasa 300 to make an appearance. The filmas visual aesthetic replicates that of 300 despite the change in director. Noam Murro obviously subscribes to the aif it ainat broke donat fix ita philosophy of filmmaking. 300 Rise of an Empire looks and feels like its predecessor. There are a lot of impressive visual moments although a few of them are obfuscated by bad 3-D. The movie makes poor use of the extra dimension using it primarily as a means of hurling globs of blood at the audience. 300 Rise of an Empire is too loud and over-the-top ever to be boring. It moves briskly from battle to battle without worrying about character development or historical accuracy. Sadly nothing in 300 Rise of an Empire comes close to generating the kind of cinematic rush that accompanied Leonidasa shout of aWe are Spartansa as he kicked the Persian messenger into a well. This filmas constant attempts to mine the first filmas touchstones result in a pale echo of a onetime success rather than a new installment of a franchise. 300 Rise of an Empire (United States 2014) Director Noam Murro Cast Sullivan Stapleton Eva Green Lena Headey Rodrigo Santoro Jack OaConnell Callan Mulvey Screenplay Zack Snyder amp; Kurt Johnstad based on the graphic novel aXerxesa by Frank Miller Cinematography Simon Duggan Music Junkie XL U.S. Distributor Warner Brothers Run Time 142 U.S. Release Date 2014-03-07 MPAA Rating ""R"" (Violence Bloody Mayhem Nudity Sexual Content) Genre ACTION/ADVENTURE Subtitles none Theatrical Aspect Ratio 2.351 Comments Add Comment Three...better movies of this genre Braveheart (1995) Hidden Fortress The (1962) Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) worse movies of this genre Tomb Raider The Cradle of Life (2003) Catwoman (2004) Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance (2012) Three...better movies of Sullivan Stapleton (There are no more better movies of Sullivan Stapleton) worse movies of Sullivan Stapleton (There are no more worst movies of Sullivan Stapleton) Three...better movies of Eva Green Casino Royale (2006) Kingdom of Heaven (Directors Cut) (1969) Kingdom of Heaven (2005) worse movies of Eva Green Dark Shadows (2012) Golden Compass The (2007) Perfect Sense (2012) Three...better movies of Lena Headey 300 (2007) Dredd (2012) (There are no more better movies of Lena Headey) worse movies of Lena Headey Purge The (2013) Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2016) Mortal Instruments The City of Bones (2013) ReelViews Library Currently in Cinema Writings Fictional Writings ReelThoughts Specials About Privacy Policy Terms and Conditions Contact Website credits",http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2734,200,300riseofanempire20,300riseofanempire,reelviews

"Review 300 Rise of an Empire 2 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Review 300 Rise of an Empire 2 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Mar 6 2014 728 AM Hilariously over-the-top when it comes to gruesome 3-D violence and woefully underserved when it comes to story ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is pretty much what the original ""300"" was a wish-fulfillment fantasy for the juiced-up bodybuilding crowd. Fans of gratuitous slow-motion disembowelings will also find much to enjoy. The blood looks like its sloshing onto the camera Everyone else however will go away grossed out or disappointed probably both. ""300"" was a big hit in 2006 making a star out of the buffed-up Gerard Butler while playing fast and loose with the legend of King Leonidas. Zach Snyder who directed the first film contributed to the screenplay this time around but ceded directing duties to Noam Murro whose only other feature credit is ""Smart People."" There arent many of them in this film. The story takes place alongside ""300."" While Leonidas is off leading the greatly outnumbered Spartans against the Persians at Thermopylae Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) of Athens is trying to unite all of Greece to hold off the Persians by sea. He is refused help by Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) Leonidas wife so he sets off with a motley crew to face off against Artemisia (Eva Green) the gleefully insane commander of the Persian navy and its greatest warrior. Shes also the kind-of sister of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) who has become the god-king of Persia an evolution that involves giving up his humanity and evidently doing about 10000 sit-ups. So once again we have undermanned overmatched (and underdressed) Greek forces in battle against the mighty Persians. Only here the defenders arent Spartans eager to die a glorious death on the battlefield. Theyre farmers and sculptors and poets and politicians. Themistokles knows that there will be great sacrifice that many men will be lost. But its all for the glory of Greece and beyond that for freedom. We know this because every so often Themistokles gives a speech about it which is supposed to be rousing but isnt exactly the St. Crispins Day speech in ""Henry V."" Murro shoots the whole thing with a background of murky clouds. Its always about to rain seems like and these weird little dust specks and sometimes flecks of fire float by. Its kind of like watching a movie from behind a fireplace grate. The best thing about the movie by far is Green. Her Artemisia is a real nut case with a taste for blood and Green is the only one in the cast who seems to be having any fun at all. The only thing that makes a movie in which you chop off peoples arms and legs and slice their heads in two (right down the middle) in SLOW MOTION palatable is a sense of humor as Sam Raimi proved in the ""Evil Dead"" movies. Otherwise its just idiotic violence cloaked behind the guise of some sort of freedom fighting. Probably plays big over by the bench-press machine but nowhere else. Visually aside from the drabness the computer-generated fleets and armies are impressive enough. But really ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is all just sound and fury signifying nothing. Or worse signifying stupidity on the part of the filmmakers and those who choose to see it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Those who can look past the fact that 300 Rise Of An Empire depicts a war between white people (technically orange people per the movies color scheme) who ""dont negotiate with tyrants"" and the brown people who hate their freedom may be able to enjoy it as a slice of bronzed and bloody beefcake kitsch. An awkward spin-off of Zack Snyders macho death fantasy 300 Rise Of An Empire retains the earlier films hyper-stylized digital backlot slickness but without the Spartan rah-rah-rah that has ensured 300s enduring popularity. In its place is uninspiring jingoism pitting the blue-cloaked Athenians upholders of democracy against the evil Achaemenid Empire made up of Persians--and therefore Iranians--who wear anachronistic turbans. Its a movie viewers are supposed to get off to though anyone who just wants to watch waxed ripped guys running jumping and thrusting (this is one of those cases where a sword isnt just a sword) while wearing leather briefs may find their enjoyment soured by the perverse political power fantasies which are the films raison detre.Led by Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) the outnumbered Athenians disembowel their way through the faceless (literally--the villains wear balaclavas and metal masks) Achaemenid horde occasionally stopping to look off into the distance while thinking aloud about the brutality of war. About half of the film is in slow motion with blood--thick strawberry-jam-like resembling the gore in a Build engine game--spurting out in all directions. The Athenians are merciless because they represent a higher ideal; the Achaemenid are merciless because they are the bad guys. During the naval battles which make up most of the movie the Achaemenids cruelly lash their galley slaves while Athenian triremes are powered by the democratic values of young men who have chosen to row of their own free will.  Theres an irony here Out of all the Ancient Greek city-states Athens depended the most on slave labor while the real-life Achaemenid Empire did not practice slavery. Athens also distinguished itself from its neighbors by granting women absolutely no legal rights. Even by the standards of the time Athenian society was notoriously xenophobic. Their legal system was a joke and their foreign policy was brutal. In fact aside from practicing a political system called ""democracy""--open to only a small portion of the population and empowered by widespread slavery--Athens was hardly a model society. The Achaemenids in the meantime built roads and infrastructure ensured religious freedom established a postal service and generally set the standard for large governments for centuries to come.Why quibble with the historical details of a movie like Rise Of An Empire? Because the way in which the movie--which is based on an unpublished Frank Miller comic--lionizes the Athenians reveals its values. Athenian misogyny is passed over because the movie conveniently features only two female characters neither of whom is Athenian the Spartan queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) and the Carian commander Artemisia (Eva Green wearing historys first pair of hidden wedges). Visually the Achaemenids are associated with black leather and gold a look thats half space-Nazi half Yeezus tour. The diversity of their empire is underscored--perhaps as a way of avoiding accusations of vilifying one particular ethnic group--while the Athenians look so alike that it becomes difficult to tell characters apart.The Achaemenids are a flashy gold-chain-wearing group composed of assorted peoples of color in baggy clothes and led by a treacherous sexually aggressive woman. The Athenians are protecting the core values of modern Western society and as it happens are composed entirely of white men without body hair or pants. Director Noam Murro and co-writers Snyder and Kurt Johnstad are probably not racists misogynists or xenophobes. However not being a bigot doesnt preclude acting like one. Actions not intentions hold value.In this sense Murro makes a perfect replacement for Snyder a director whose work is fixated on visual and narrative flash but which is continually undermined by ignorance of its implications. Murro doesnt so much direct as frame and stage placing the characters against digital desktop-wallpaper skies and constructing each battle scene as a showcase for the characters prowess and toughness. Aside from raccoon-eyed Green--the only actor aware of the movies campiness shoving so much scenery into her mouth that she barely has time to chew--everyone in the cast exudes the same kind of serioso steely resolve. But what does all this cool posturing add up to? The answer lies in the title. The Empire in question is not the Achaemenids but Athens--a power that deserves to slaughter and subjugate its enemies because it represents a cornerstone of Western culture and whose actions are excused because they represent noble intentions.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr EMERALD IN THE ROUGH Eva Green is brilliant in the surprisingly entertaining 300 Rise of an Empire (Warner Bros) B 300 Rise of an Empire Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Eva Green Rodrigo Santoro; Director Noam Murro; Release Date Wide 03/07/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 103; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted March 20 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Proving the old adage that those who cough up 10 bucks to see history are doomed to repeat it we now get a sequel of sorts to Zack Snyders razzle-dazzle Spartan bloodfest 300. I wasnt a huge fan of the original. It felt like a Joe Weider bodybuilding magazine turned into an ultraviolent videogame. But the films visual artistry was undeniable. In 300 Rise of an Empire director Noam Murro uses 3-D to up the wow factor even further. Theres so much crimson gore flying off the screen you feel as if you should be wearing a tarp like the folks in the front row of a Gallagher show. Xerxes the pierced and waxy-smooth Persian king played by Rodrigo Santoro is out to avenge the death of his father at the hands of strapping Athenian he-man Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton). Egged on by his sultry adviser Artemisia (Eva Green) Xerxes and his men square off against the outnumbered Greek forces -- this time on the high seas. The Aegean setting is a nice excuse to stage clever naval gambits that turn into slo-mo orgies of impaling and limb-hacking. But really the film belongs to Green -- maybe the only actress ever to ""graduate"" from being a Bertolucci muse to a bloodthirsty action-flick dominatrix. With her raven hair smoky voice and leather fetish wear she gooses the repetitive carnage into something deliciously sinister. In the movies best scene she and her enemy Themistokles turn a discussion of surrender into a rough-sex brawl. Henry Kissinger shes not.

Photo Warner Bros. Pictures MOVIE REVIEW 300 Rise of an Empire Running time 108 minutes. Rated R (extreme graphic violence profanity nudity sex). At the Lincoln Square the Empire the Kips Bay others. I have no doubt that catching the ouchy end of a spear with your abdomen can be disquieting or that it may be unpleasant to be thrown into the drink as your flaming ship is reduced to toothpicks. In ""300 Rise of an Empire"" though all of this looks like a jolly good time which is why the film works as a high-tech boy-fantasy successor to ""Conan the Barbarian."" Taking place concurrently with ""300"" in which Spartans broke off from other Greeks to get massacred by Persians this one finds the Persian navy being led by the deliciously diabolical Artemesia (Eva Green). Shes an ethnic Greek who having been kidnapped and raped in battle was raised by Persians to become a sword-wielding warrior and rose to become the power behind the throne of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro). Her opposite number in a loincloth and blue cape is Themistokles the Greek freedom fighter who seeks to unite the various democratic states into one great anti-Persian fighting machine but is rebuffed by the surviving Spartan queen (Lena Headey). Sparta seems kind of like Texas You wouldnt want to fight a war without them but theyd want to run everything their way and probably make you listen to country music in which case maybe youd rather just go ahead and die a beautiful death. Green rules the picture with her nutty stare and her willingness to get nasty in a hot sex scene but the movies main weak point is the Greek general Themistokles. Eva Green stars in ""300 Rise of an Empire.""Photo Warner Bros. Pictures Hes played by Sullivan Stapleton a man not fit to wash Gerard Butlers loincloth (just as Butler isnt fit to carry Russell Crowes). With his pretty-boy eyes he seems like the kind of guy youd meet at the salad bar wearing a fishermans sweater. The lunatic blood lust you need in a mythic war hero isnt there nor in the eyes of any of his interchangeable brothers in arms. Out-performing them all is the blood thick as 10W-40 spewing in globs and blasts. It isnt remotely disturbing because its so stylized and comic book-ish. The gore in the PG-13 ""Son of God"" which was meant to hurt and did was far more disturbing. In ""300 Rise of an Empire"" snicking the head off an underperforming officer in your navy seems like no more than routine disciplinary action. Tough love. Like Lou Gossett Jr. making Richard Gere do push-ups in the rain. Going to the trouble of cleaving a friends neck in twain is just another way of showing you care. All those limb-choppings and neck-severings accompany half a dozen boffo action set pieces. For instance Guy in flames falls through a jet of oil which he turns into a massive blowtorch. Wreckage men and arms all fall into the sea and turn it into a giant churning chowder of despair. Then sea monsters. OK there isnt a lot of seriousness here and the relentless attempts to coin a new battle-cry catchphrase do approach self-parody. But why fight it? This isnt Sparta. This  . . .  is  . . .

In that picture directed by Zack Snyder and based on Frank Millers graphic novel about the three-day Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. the Spartans and their small but mighty army kicked the asses of the Persians with much yelling grunting and spilling of black-red CGI blood. Though it isnt exactly a sequel Rise of an Empire might have been essentially more of the same but for one distinction that makes it 300 times better than its predecessor Mere mortals of Athens Sparta and every city from Mumbai to Minneapolis behold the magnificent Eva Green and tremble A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - While warrior-king Leonidas was mixing it up at Thermopylae Athenian general Themistocles was doing his damnedest to fend off the Persian navy at nearby Artemisium. Thats the conflict dramatized in 300 Rise of an Empire also based on source material by Miller this time with Israeli director Noam Murro at the helm (though Snyder had a hand in the screenplay). Once again real live human actors have been subjected to some unholy CGI process that renders their skin poreless and flat -- it glows like reconstituted marble. And again 99.9 per cent of the characters are men who run around jabbing swords into one anothers sternums and going ""Gaaah"" This time theyre just doing it at sea.You dont need to have seen 300 to get the gist of Rise of an Empire though it probably helps. Gerard Butler does not make a return as Leonidas though his face shows up in the admittedly stunning opening shot a brownish jumble of dead bodies that gradually shifts into a death tableau rendered in muted but glowing colors like medieval stained glass. This time around Themistocles gentle-spirited but tough as a lions claw is the star of the show -- hes played by Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton (Animal Kingdom Gangster Squad) who musters at least a few whiskers worth of authority as he delivers sub-St. Crispins Day lines like ""We choose to die on our feet rather than live on our knees"" Those who loved 300 -- or even just those who recall it as a beefcake blur -- will note the return of several characters among them Lena Headeys stern no-makeup-look Queen Gorgo David Wenhams one-eyed warrior Dilios and best of all Rodrigo Santoros Persian god-king Xerxes who once again graces the screen with his multiple piercings gold-dipped skin and glistening chrome dome. Hes like the Oscar Statuette crossed with Mr. Clean.Film Details 300 Rise of an Empire RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time102 More Info Trailer Other delights for people of all sexes and persuasions include an adorable swain in a mini-kilt (Jack OConnell) and an array of impressive digitally created backgrounds. Of those the Persian ones are the best The interiors are dazzling a riot of elaborate panther carvings and gently shimmering fish-scale patterns. Its always a disappointment when the action shifts back to Athens with its tasteful businesslike columns and guys walking around solemnly in rough tunics each held together with a little clip.Admittedly even if youre not really one for digital effects the whole enterprise looks pretty grand. Yet the finest spectacle in all of Rise of an Empire is a human being Eva Green plays resident bad gal Artemisia commander of the Persian navy. As a child she watched as Greek soldiers raped and killed members of her family; then the Greeks made her a slave violating her and leaving her for dead. She was rescued by Persians and trained as a warrior. Now she hates all Greek men -- wouldnt you? -- though her hormones kick into love-hate overdrive when she gets a gander at Themistocles and his noble brow (among other attributes).But really whos looking at him? In her every scene -- and thankfully shes in lots of them -- Greens Artemisia is something to behold. She makes her entrance in a fringed leather gown with a molded breastplate sweeping into the Persian palace like a B.C. Morticia Addams. From there her costumes become even more elaborate There are one-shouldered numbers draped with chains and dotted with grommets shimmery columns that resemble liquid metal and perhaps finest of all a skin-tight sheath with a row of silver spikes running down her spinal column like a violent shiver. Artemisia wears gowns even onboard her ship fer Chrissakes. Her over-the-topness -- and in one scene her resplendent toplessness -- really gets Rise of an Empire cooking.Green is a far better actress than shes usually given credit for. In Bernardo Bertoluccis The Dreamers her debut she captured perfectly that bumpy stage in the growing-up timeline when youre hoping to mask coming-of-age awkwardness with been-there done-that sophistication. And as James Bonds doomed love Vesper in Casino Royale she blended gravity with vulnerability a hard mix to get right whether youre shaking or stirring.Green knows just what to do in 300 Rise of an Empire She takes the dialogue seriously but gives each line a mischievous tweak. Artemisia commands her naval warriors as if she were telling them what to do in bed ""Today we will dance across the backs of dead Greeks"" she purrs pronouncing the word dance ""dahnse"" -- because thats what an all-powerful enchantress would do. When she lowers her kohl-rimmed eyes the sailors hear and they obey. Theyll kill for her and theyll die for her. Green makes it all look like dahnsing.1 Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

She may as well be speaking to the audience. Even lighter on story than Zack Snyders 2007 predecessor with an even more imposing array of beardy-yet-waxed male specimens on display 300 Rise of an Empire essentially cops to being an equal-opportunity droolfest as homoerotic or empoweringly macho as you want it to be with more women in play this time round. Director Noam Murro is at the helm now; his first film the smug campus comedy Smart People was an odd training ground for this. The oppressive red-and-sepia styling of the original has been tempered a bit - manly charcoal hues are in this season with burgundy blood now sloshed generously across the screen in 3D. Stepping in for the slain Gerard Butler is the strappingly named Sullivan Stapleton as Themistocles of Athens (and to judge by his accent Melbourne) chosen to lead the allied Greek states in naval battle against Persia. Their fleet in turn is commanded by warrior queen Artemesia played by the splendidly vampy Eva Green as a kind of Xena/Joan Crawford hybrid who lops off heads in gold lame. Its a pleasingly fair fight. Storytelling is left to Headeys wordy voiceover; its flesh and carnage that the audience is here to see and Murro delivers it by the glistening ton pausing only for stray bits of backstory. We learn how Persian god-king Xerxes came to be (short version he took a bath and emerged as both members of Right Said Fred) while a token father-son arc serves only to give British star-in-the-making Jack OConnell a few extra lines. Its all extravagantly daft moves at a fair clip and is over before you expect it to be - one suspects the actual Battle of Artemisium was rather different.

Few recent tentpoles have lent themselves less naturally to a sequel than Zack Snyders ""300"" a movie in which nearly all the major characters died while a brief coda showed a unified Greek army about to lay waste to the remnants of Persia. But Snyder and co-writer Kurt Johnstad handily surmount that problem in ""300 Rise of an Empire"" which offers a ""meanwhile back in Athens"" story to complement the Spartan narrative of the first film along with an even higher quotient of impaled torsos severed limbs and rippling Mediterranean musculature. Anchored by Eva Greens fearsome performance as a Persian naval commander whose vengeful bloodlust makes glowering King Xerxes seem a mere poseur this highly entertaining time-filler lacks the mythic resonances that made ""300"" feel like an instant classic but works surprisingly well on its own terms. Arriving in theaters on the box office fumes of ""The Legend of Hercules"" and ""Pompeii"" it should prove to be the ancient epic auds have been waiting for. If ""300"" was largely a boys-only affair ""Rise of an Empire"" very much belongs to the women -- specifically one woman named Artemisia (Green) who sports a warriors stoic countenance and the blazing azure stare of a femme very fatale. As a young girl we learn the Greek-born Artemisia watched helplessly as her entire village (including her parents) was slaughtered by other invading Greeks earning her a healthy distrust of her own people. Spared but sold into slavery she was rescued by the Persian King Darius (Igal Naor) father of Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) who raised her as a kind of surrogate daughter and stoked her warrior ethos. And while Xerxes battles things out with the good King Leonidas (Gerard Butler seen in recycled footage from the first film) on land it is Artemisia who leads Persias charge against Greece by sea. Shes a ferocious presence but well matched by Spartas own Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey reprising her ""300"" role) who has less screen time but also serves as the movies narrator holding forth on the long and bloody backstory of the Greco-Persian wars as she guides a warship toward a looming battle. (Both ""300"" films have made effective use of a slightly formal literary voiceover to evoke the oral tradition of Greek epic poetry.) Fittingly regal and stern Gorgo recounts the first clash of these two great armies a decade earlier at the town of Marathon which plays out in flashback as the first of the movies extravagant battle scenes. The outnumbered Greeks engage the weary Persians before they have even managed to row their boats ashore while the valiant Gen. Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) hurls the fateful spear that deals King Darius a mortal blow. We learn too of the strange dark magic by which Xerxes evolved from his once-human form into his more familiar appearance that of an 8-foot-tall Grace Jones after a rough night at a piercing parlor. All this is neatly dispensed in the first 30 minutes or so leaving the rest of the running time for the kind of elaborately choreographed combat that was ""300s"" stock-in-trade here with the violent storm waters of Aegean substituted for the narrow mountain passes of Thermopylae. Though Snyder has stayed on as writer and producer ""Rise of an Empire"" was directed by Noam Murro a veteran commercials director whose lone previous feature the 2008 Dennis Quaid dramedy ""Smart People"" offered no indication that he could handle a project of this size and scale. But Murro acquits himself more than well borrowing a lot from Snyders playbook while managing to find his own way through the material. Working with Australian d.p. Simon Duggan (""The Great Gatsby"") Murro re-creates the previous films distinctive duochromatic palate (ochre for day deep-blue for night) with the actors again performing against mostly digital sets -- a look that may not be to the tastes of some analog cinema purists but which comes as close as any movies have to a cinematic equivalent for the vibrant active panels of the comicbook artist Frank Miller (whose work inspired both ""300"" films). Murro favors a somewhat faster messier look than the first ""300"" with a constantly tracking swooping camera in lieu of Snyders more fixed meticulously composed tableaux and a minimum of the super slow-motion that gave ""300s"" battle scenes their dreamy ethereal air. And when it comes to blood of which there will be plenty Murros is darker thicker and gloppier than Snyders bright-red pointillist splays. ""Rise of an Empire"" never quite shakes the sense that were watching an undercard bout while Leonidas is off fighting for the title and how could it not? Under Themistokles command these Athenians are an altogether more civilized lot than their neighbors to the south lacking the suicidal fire in their bellies that drove the Spartans to seek their so-called ""beautiful deaths."" These farmers poets and artists -- heck even Aeschylus himself (Hans Matheson) is among them -- go more reluctantly to war and Themistokles himself cuts a less iconic figure than mighty Leonidas. But when push comes to shove they rise to the occasion and the movies long impressively sustained central naval engagement (modeled on the real-life Battle of Artemisium) is as exciting for its large-scale clashes of military might as for its minutiae of Greco-Persian battle strategy. The images are duly spectacular as Murros camera swoops and dives from every conceivable direction Greek ships charging the Persian armada like so battering rams; mighty wooden vessels reduced to splinters by the jutting rocks of a narrow strait; nautical and human debris swiftly subsumed by the churning tempest. Yet not a bit of it is as startling as even a fleeting glimpse of Artemisias icily intent stare. Elsewhere Murro and the writers fold in some compelling side business As in ""300"" theres a focus on a pair of father and son soldiers Scyllias and Calisto the latter played with appealing humility by the rising young star Jack OConnell (fresh off his bracing star turn in the IRA drama ""71"" and soon to be back at sea in Angelina Jolies ""Unbroken""). Three visual effects houses and two vfxsupervisors share credit for the movies seamless integration of the real and the virtual. Also making a major contribution the Dutch electronica composer Tom Holkenborg aka Junkie XL whose throbbing muscular score seems to be echoing forth from some distant place in the cosmos.

Whatever says November 16 2014 at 159 pm Unimpressed with the over the top gore and soulless theme os this movie. Green looks like a anorexic model and in now way pulls of the role of a ""warrior"" woman. Yawn. Reply Harun Karali says March 13 2014 at 540 pm Thank you somebody who actually understands a good movie when they see one. spectacular review. 5 stars Reply Dalton Branch says March 7 2014 at 834 am King was killed by an arrow in this movie not a spear. Good review though. Reply Lance Smith says March 6 2014 at 246 pm I guess we shall see....I enjoyed aspects of the first movie. I ""got"" the stylized nature of the film and the story. In this case what concerns me most is probably the inclusion of a key female role IF that female role is more or less symbolic or token in nature. Too many movies/shows throw a female into a dangerous violent role...and then proceed to do everything they can to protect that female in ways a male would never be protected. Does she experience real risk? Is her life really ever in danger? Are the fights staged in order to make her look good and does she come across as super-human? Finally does the movie end with her death - as it arguably should and certainly would if SHE were a HE - or does she learn a ""moral"" or escape at the last minute? And finally is she the only female in the movie or does she have female ""grunts"" that are also fighting the good (or not so good) fight? Havent a token female at the head of an army if there are no female soldiers is completely and utterly preposterous. After all one doesnt just wake up one day and lead an army...they serve as a grunt and work their way up. If she is leading then other women should also be working their way up. So in the end Im fine with a woman playing a violent dangerous role....what I have a problem with is if she is playing that role only to pander or add buzz. That doesnt add any depth and it certainly doesnt do women any service. Reply johntshea says March 6 2014 at 411 pm Except Artemisia was a real person who became the ruler of Halicarnassus on the death of her husband commanded a fleet whose crews were all male and who was not killed in the battle. Real life does not follow the rules of drama. Reply Reginald says March 5 2014 at 705 am There was a massive amount of enjoyment for me from the first 300 movie. I was ecstatic when I seen they were releasing a somewhat of a sequel. I believe with including a woman main character will give the movie a little more depth. Based on the trailers I will support the film and do not anticipate any disappointment in this film. Some of the art and special effects in the first one was a little bit over the top and unrealistic however oddly it drew me into the storyline more because of it. Reply PETER says March 4 2014 at 951 am I didnt like the first one so would rather see POMPEII Or even HERCULES. I didnt like the look of 300; it didnt look real at all. Too over-done arty and not real at all so couldnt get into it comic book or not who cares. Reply The Kingslayer says March 4 2014 at 554 am I am surprised at how positive the review for this have been I was expecting it to get slaughtered. Reply johntshea says March 3 2014 at 1100 am Salamis was the first great sea battle in history and by no means a side-show. It was at least as important as Thermopylae. And Artemesias fleet was all Greek though fighting for the Persians. Reply big daddy D says March 3 2014 at 149 pm I have no knowledge of tgese events..Although ive been reading Greek mythology since I was 8 years old..37 years. Looking forward to seeing this movie on Friday night. Reply big daddy D says March 3 2014 at 523 pm Hmmm..guess Ill have to do some wiki research. Greek history/mythology has always been a favorite of mine. johntshea says March 3 2014 at 458 pm History not mythology Big Daddy D. Artemisia (misspelled in my first comment sorry) was a real person more extraordinary than most mythological characters.

Playing the most vicious and certainly sexiest naval commander ever to ride the waves of the Aegean Eva Green has a one-for-the-ages scene in 300 Rise of an Empire in which she decapitates an adversary with two deft sword strokes then holding his head by the hair kisses him on the mouth with pointedly derisive hunger. Given his condition the man does not respond but given the bestower it wouldnt have been surprising if he had ... just a bit. Other than for the pleasure of watching Green try to conquer ancient Greece dressed as a distant forebearer of Catwoman more is less and a little late in this long-aborning sequel to the 2007 bloodbath that was stylistically extreme and just different enough from anything else in its field to become an international action sensation. Centering on mostly aquatic battles that historically took place simultaneously to the Battle of Thermopylae so fancifully depicted in the earlier film this follow-up slavishly adheres to the graphic comics-meet-video games look of the original. It would be a mild surprise if box-office results equaled those of the original which came to 456 million worldwide (slightly more from foreign than domestic tills) but most fans will still probably want to check it out. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies Although Gerard Butlers star has significantly fallen due to the 17 mediocre films hes made since 300 hes missed here; his replacement at the top of the sequels cast Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton just cant bellow on a par with Butler whose cocky over-the-top abandon and staunch physical presence leave big sandals to fill. Visually there was clearly a mandate to hew close to the originals look. All the same its disappointing that after all the years no effort has been made to augment or riff on the style at all; in fact the new film is more monochromatic and duller in appearance lacking the bold reds and rich earth tones that are glimpsed here in brief visits to Sparta and the events at Thermopylae. Original director Zack Snyder who moved on to the Superman franchise at Warner Bros. turned the directing reins over to Israeli commercials ace Noam Murro whose previous feature was the 2008 independent Smart People. However Snyder stayed around to co-produce and adapt Frank Millers graphic novel Xerxes along with returning co-scripter Kurt Johnstad. Other top creative personnel are different which hasnt prevented the sequel from sporting the same bombastic slo-mo blood-in-your-face aesthetic. Narrated by Lena Headeys Spartan Queen Gorgo Rise looks at the Persian invasion of Greece in the late summer of 480 B.C. from a different angle than did the land-based 300 concentrating on the purported 1000-ship fleet that King Xerxes expected would have an easy time conquering the divided Greeks. It also provides some nifty illustrated backstory tidbits; that the arrow that killed Persian King Darius was fired by Themistokles (Stapleton) that Artemisia (Green) is a Greek who turned on her own people for what they did to her and her family and that Xerxes (the returning Rodrigo Santoro) in a vividly illustrated sequence had himself transformed from man to golden god (who resembles a walking advertisement for a Beverly Hills jewelry store) so he could exact revenge for his fathers death by conquering the Greeks once and for all. VIDEO 300 Rise of an Empire Trailer Has More Blood Guts and Glory So while Spartan King Leonidas keeps Xerxes occupied at the ""hot gates"" the non-aristocratic soldier-politician Themistokles dares to engage the mighty Persian navy with a far smaller force but with much shrewdness. Although hes managed to patch together a coalition of Greek states to try to ward off the Persians assault his repeated attempts to persuade Sparta to join in are rebuffed by Gorgo who insists that her city-state does not share the Athenian dream of a united Greece. But in 300 -- or is it 600 now? -- 2500-year-old geopolitics takes a back seat to ranting speeches ripped torsos manly-manness and the spurting spilling and splashing blood which is often aimed strategically at the viewer for maximum 3D effect. When Greeks wade into battle jumping from ship to ship the film slips way over into video game mode as Themistokles the father-son team of Scyllias and Calisto (Callan Mulvey and Jack OConnell) and others implausibly cut through hordes of opponents with little trouble. For much of the time the Greeks have luck on their side and director Murro and his team clearly visualize how low clouds and fog hide the straits into which the home team induces the invaders to unwittingly enter. They also show how the outnumbered locals effectively use a circling strategy to disrupt the Persians attack mode sending many to a watery grave. To be an unsuccessful subordinate to Artemisia is not an enviable position; her punishments as weve seen are most creative. But as her opponents successes mount the imperious warrior develops an admiration -- and maybe something more -- for Themistokles skills. Implausibly he accepts her invitation for a shipboard summit at which their intense enmity crosses the line into craven lust resulting in a contest of rough and varied sex that leaves them both with a heightened sense of competitiveness. That she doesnt kill him afterward like a praying mantis seems entirely out of character. Although Themistokles inspirational speech to his dwindling supply of troops is nowhere near as rousing as Leonidas was before the Spartans last stand in 300 the result in the Straits of Salamis is quite the opposite. In their final armed face-off Artemisia takes the opportunity to insult Themistokles lovemaking skills but he has the last laugh. If Rise proves to be anywhere near as successful as its progenitor one or perhaps two films could follow that would be set in the following year 479 B.C. when the united Greeks this time with Spartan help put an end once and for all to Persian dreams of local conquest with same-day land and sea victories at Plataea and Mycale respectively. More than in the original its often easy to tell where the small foreground sets occupied by the actors end and the digitally created backgrounds begin. The score by Junkie XL is predictably orotund although some unusual and arresting moments emerge here and there.

Working from a script by the original ""300"" team of Frank Miller Kurt Johnstad and Zack Snyder director Noam Murro (""Smart People"") inherits the first films gold-dipped speed-ramped camerawork and its penchant for heroic largesse. But ""Rise of an Empire"" lacks director Snyders shrewd deconstruction of cartoonish hagiography undermining the glorious robust escapism of testosterone-fueled historical reenactment with an underdog story that feels almost too reflective to be rousing. Watch video Eva Green Sullivan Stapleton Mix Business With Pleasure in New 300 Rise of an Empire Trailer (Video) Taking place concurrently with the first film ""Rise of an Empire"" stars Sullivan Stapleton (TVs ""Strike Back"") as Themistocles an Athenian general who resorts to battling Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his conquering Persian armies only after exhausting all efforts to unite Greece as a democratic nation. Refused help from Sparta by Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) Themistocles assembles a small army of free men and employs naval strategy to impede the Persians from striking land. But after finding his ranks decimated by the sheer volume of forces being controlled by Queen Artemisia (Eva Green) Persias most formidable general Themistocles begins to reconsider the actual cost to his men - and to his country -- of pursuing a so-called noble death. The great thing about the first film is that it never lets you forget youre hearing a story - a kind of ubermensch myth-making that excites soldiers and inspires nationalism regardless of the odds that are being faced. Indeed its only because of the fire in the few survivors bellies at the end of the first ""300"" that the film feels remotely like a triumph sure 299 of their best men got slaughtered but now their lesser-trained backups are super pissed-off readying themselves to fight and if necessary to die in defense of their country. As told by Dilios (David Wenham) the term ""dramatic license"" doesnt begin to cover the level of hyperbole he applies to King Leonidas defense of Sparta. But even if the events of ""Rise of an Empire"" take place at virtually the same time as those in ""300"" theyre being regaled to audiences seven years later -- and to present them with a similar kind of propagandistic zeal might seem irresponsible given the seemingly inexhaustible supply of Americas real-world conflicts. As such Murro presents Themistocles wartime position as a counterpoint to Leonidas as he champions democratic ideals agonizes over the prospect of sending free men to war and sees little glory in their deaths. Oddly the very respectability of that narrative choice tends to undermine the gritty enjoyment of watching people get dismembered in spectacular slow motion. When were meant to like care about the fact that these people are human its not as fun. Also read Miley Cyrus Will Smith and Zack Snyder Make GQs List of Least Influential People That said Murro hasnt turned fans beloved ""300"" into some kind of solemn eulogy for antiquitys lost soldiers; far from it. In fact he matches Snyders sense of bloody camp blow for cringe-inducing blow expanding the first films meat-and-potatoes combination of sex and violence into a full-blown smorgasboard thanks to an ass-kicking centerpiece sex scene between Themistocles and Artemisia thats sort of hilariously ""empowering"" as a portrait of two equals competing to show who possesses more testosterone. But the broader edges of Snyders tale which was populated by giants monsters and mystics have been pared away to focus on the mettle of ""real"" men making the ultimate sacrifice as awesomely as humanly possible on behalf of their country. For better or for worse Stapleton is a star in the same way that Gerard Butler was one when he starred in ""300"" and it remains to be seen whether Hollywood figures out how best to utilize him elsewhere. But hes a formidable presence on screen and theres an appealing consciousness behind his eyes that elevates him above the ranks of the industrys aspiring action heroes; hes a next-gen Russell Crowe without quite the same depths of simmering intensity. Otherwise ""Rise of an Empire"" is all Eva Greens show and she clearly relishes the opportunity to not only match but exceed her male counterparts supposedly indefatigable toughness. Though Green sees more action in this film than Headeys Queen Gorgo did in ""300"" the earlier heroine offered a promising template for female leadership commanding respect while always remembering her place in this mans world. But Green demolishes the eras gender dynamics with a performance that plays like an act of revenge upon all of the b.s. love-interest roles shes ever been offered. Also read Penny Dreadful Trailer Josh Hartnett and Eva Green in a World of Sex Blood and Monsters That Artemisia is Themistocles story-assigned opponent offers a welcome change in action-movie formula; that Green makes her a convincing adversary (physically as well as emotionally) is a testament to the actress talent and commitment. Meanwhile Murros only crime is failing to show any hint of directorial authorship; his considerable control of the form and structure of the narrative notwithstanding its unclear what ideas or message he wants to impose upon material Snyder made his own. But given that the movies priority as a whole seems to be to replicate the style and impact of its predecessor his imprint might simply be fidelity. In that regard hes entirely successful which is why ""300 Rise of an Empire"" is a worthy companion piece to the first film; even though its message may emphatically support democracy its director seems to be a puppet installed by a dictator.
