Jackson) a decorated 30-year Marine veteran now facing court-martial doesnt bellow You cant handle the truth...2000-04-14Ben KingsleyGuy PearceBen Kingsley Guy PearceParamount Pictures B Rules of Engagement Genre Drama War; Starring Samuel L. Jackson Tommy Lee Jones Ben Kingsley Guy Pearce; Director William Friedkin; Author Stephen Gaghan; Runtime (in minutes) 128; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Paramount Pictures Posted April 14 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT Col. Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) a decorated 30-year Marine veteran now facing court-martial doesnt bellow ""You cant handle the truth"" during his trial in Rules of Engagement. But he thinks it. How could civilians or deskbound military types -- ""Starbucks drinkers whove never seen combat"" -- know what its like to be under fire? Childers knows He served in Vietnam Lebanon and the Persian Gulf. And when hes sent to Yemen to rescue the American ambassador (Ben Kingsley) cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops Childers does what he has to do evacuate the family and protect the men under his command. After three Marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire he orders his troops to shoot into the crowd. More than 80 Yemeni men women and children are mowed down. Did Childers violate authorized U.S. military rules of engagement? Desperate to avert an international dustup the national security adviser (Bruce Greenwood) with his Starbucks-drinkers sleek haircut wants the militarys prosecuting attorney (Guy Pearce) to prove he did. To help with his defense Childers calls on Col. Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) the old Vietnam buddy whose life he saved some three decades earlier. Retired from active duty a mediocre attorney but first-rate cynic Hodges at first demurs. ""Im a shot-at Marine and a weak lawyer"" he says. But coming from Jones you just know theres hoo-ha in the tough leatherneck yet. Directed by William Friedkin (The French Connection) with an old Hollywood vets command of action and story building Rules of Engagement is a traditional crisis-and-aftermath flashback-and-trial military thriller not unlike A Few Good Men and Courage Under Fire. The commanding gravitas of Jackson (who always raises a movies game whether the projects worthy of him or not) is comfortably met by Jones bulldog cussedness; the two actors are soldiers of hard-headed substance at attention in a field of milder actors at ease. And with such a mature team Rules has countless opportunities to go deep -- to really look at the warping of right and wrong thats an inevitable part of combat and of diplomacy too. But the movie backs off each time theres an opportunity for us to be challenged by ambiguity. For every unnerving hypothetical out of a Fred Friendly seminar -- what if the U.S. ambassador to Yemen is a weakling and stays that way? What if the Americans really do lack an understanding of Arab culture? -- the drama ultimately retreats to safer duller more illogical and more reactionary impulses and stereotypes. Friedkin and screenwriter Stephen Gaghan (The Practice) construct an intricate card tower of evidence collection and trial detours. Then they blow the cards down in a gust of hoo-ha meant to satisfy Starbucks drinkers and leathernecks alike. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

Jackson makes his military man believably flawed in `Rules of Engagement Bob Graham Chronicle Senior Writer Published 400 am Friday April 7 2000 RULES OF ENGAGEMENT Court-martial drama. Starring Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones. Directed by William Friedkin. (Rated R. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are allusions to two iconographic images from the Vietnam War in William Friedkins court-martial drama ""Rules of Engagement"" An officer blows out the brains of an unarmed prisoner point-blank and there is a helicopter airlift from the roof of a U.S. Embassy . How much the director wants to rehash divisive issues from that bitter war -- U.S. protesters of this fictional conflict are briefly shown in an unfavorable light -- remains an open question. What isnt in question is that this drama about a massacre in Yemen takes on unexpected interest because the main character a fiery-eyed Marine combat hero played by Samuel L. Jackson is presented as a believably flawed man. The case against him turns on the issue of when a military man trained to kill becomes a murderer and a little too patly involves a coverup. We are told that the combat buddy who defends him is a second-rate attorney and it would be more interesting if he were but thats not what we see. Tommy Lee Jones performance though it seems to be based more on his crows-feet than usual cant be faulted however. But the single most compelling performance may belong to Australian actor Guy Pearce (""The Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert"" ""L.A. Confidential"") as Jones adversary the Marine prosecutor. Raw- boned like the young Frank Sinatra and with an American accent and pugnacity that recall him Pearce is tough and uncompromising but decent. The ambiguity of the key sequence the siege of an American embassy by Yemeni demonstrators and the helicopter evacuation of its shaken-up ambassador (Ben Kingsley) is deftly laid out by Friedkin (""The French Connection"" ""Cruising""). The bond between the two Marine officers Col. Terry Childers (Jackson) and Col. Hays Hodges (Jones) was sealed 28 years earlier when Childers saved Hodges life in a Vietnam ambush. Blood flying in slow motion characterizes the battle. Jackson whose high-wattage glare dominates from across a room makes plausible the prosecutions belief that Childers has a murderously short fuse and will blow up on the stand. Hodges describes himself as ""a shot-up Marine"" is called a drunk and tells Childers that ""Im a good enough lawyer to know you need a better lawyer than me."" That promising angle remains talked about but undeveloped. Bruce Greenwood (last seen with Jones in ""Double Jeopardy"") plays a cagey national security adviser and Kingsleys ambassador becomes more mealymouthed as the movie progresses -- there is a wonderfully revealing exchange of salutes between him and Jackson. Advisory Contains graphic combat violence and profanity. ..

""Rules of Engagement"" is a nuts-and-bolts ramrod-straight military thriller that uses a distinctly unsavory case to defend the honor of the U.S. Marines way of life. Taking a broad and obvious approach to ambiguous material thats virtually all plot mechanics with little nuance or characterization William Friedkins combat-and-courtroom drama possesses sufficient action and conflict to put it over as a solid commercial attraction and it will be easy for Paramount to suggest to the public that the picture is this seasons ""A Few Good Men"" or ""The Generals Daughter"" big hits both. The specifics of the situation which were elaborated into a screenplay by TV writer Stephen Gaghan from a story by former Marine infantry commander and Secretary of the Navy James Webb may be distinct from other screen military mellers but the dynamics -- the honor of the military view vs. the incomprehension and hostility of civilians -- are pretty familiar. Probably the film ""Rules"" most resembles notably in its stress on decisions made under difficult battle conditions and its concern with the truth about how and why tragic events occurred is the 1996 ""Courage Under Fire"" which also dealt with combat in the Middle East. Ten-minute prologue illustrates the defining moment in the lifelong bond between Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson) and Hays Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) which was cemented when the former saved the latters life during a mission in Vietnam. Twenty-eight years later Col. Childers presents Col. Hodges with a sword at his retirement party from the Marines before heading off for another arena of conflict this time in Yemen. With angry crowds besieging the American Embassy Childers commands three Marine choppers that are sent to rescue the cowering ambassador (Ben Kingsley) his wife (Anne Archer) and son. By the time the colonel and his men arrive snipers are firing from rooftops across the street and the mob is launching rocks and knocking down the doors to the ancient palace. Childers only barely manages to spirit out the government representative in the nick of time. But the fighting continues Marines start to be killed and Childers finally gives the order to start firing into the crazed crowd. The result is an international scandal Eighty-three Arabs are dead including many women and children with scores more wounded. Snapping into action the transparently evil National Security Adviser William Sokal (Bruce Greenwood) demands that the blame for the slaughter be placed squarely upon Col. Childers for giving illegal orders to ""murder"" unarmed people so as to take responsibility off the United States in general. In other words the fix is in from the start and theres nothing that even sympathetic military higher-ups can do about it. Rightly sensing hes being hung out to dry Childers asks his old buddy Hodges who went to law school after Nam to represent him at the court-martial. Although Hodges insists ""Im a weak lawyer"" he can hardly refuse his friend who flatly states the films p.o.v. when he says ""If Im guilty of this Im guilty of everything Ive done in combat for the last 30 years."" Hodges takes a quick trip to Yemen in search of anything or anyone possibly helpful to his client but all he finds is heated anti-Americanism and mutilated victims mostly children of Marine bullets. He returns mad as hell at Childers but then the audience gets to see something that no one else sees a videotape taken by an embassy security camera that clearly shows many of the ""innocent"" men women and yes children in the crowd firing guns at the American compound and its defenders. Finding this evidence at odds with his intentions Sokal tosses the one and only tape in the fire. Final 45 minutes are devoted to the trial in which callow bulldog prosecutor Maj. Mark Biggs (Guy Pearce) relentlessly attacks Childers alleged recklessness and makes him look pretty bad. Hodges chips away at the governments case as best he can even managing to suggest that Sokal destroyed the tape he proves was sent to the State Dept. from Yemen. But it just doesnt look like its going to be enough especially in light of the weasely ambassadors lies on the stand and Childers own unfortunate outburst at a crucial point. ""Rules of Engagement"" gives fresh meaning to the term ""narrative cinema"" since there is essentially nothing else here. A reserved man who says he wants to spend his retirement fly fishing Hodges is divorced with a grown son and once had ""a drinking problem"" but thats all the information about him provided by either the script or Jones recessive performance. Jackson has even less to work with since Childers is defined only as Pure Marine -- no family no psychology no nothing. A big fight between the two aging comrades-in-arms in which Hodges assaults Childers after his return from Yemen is clearly meant to be a classic Big Scene with two stars beating up on each other but Friedkin doesnt stage it too well and the underlying layers of comedy and love between the men dont find expression. The anti-Arab defamation crowd could conceivably mobilize itself for this one since all Yemeni adults but one are seen as hate-filled marauders. Still none of them is as clearly nefarious as the National Security Adviser who rather than the military is meant to represent the poison that infects the American establishment. It cannot be denied however that such a story develops a pull and momentum of its own that the issues of justice honor professionalism patriotism and bonds between soldiers can generate feelings independent of the characters who embody them and that courtroom dramas arent that difficult to make interesting and even gripping. Friedkin has an affinity for the trappings of the genre even if he doesnt do much special with them this time out and the 15-minute action sequence of the Yemeni siege and evacuation undeniably builds to a blood-coursing level of intensity. But the pictures outlook on the events it depicts is strictly legalistic never broadening to assume anything resembling a political moral or philosophical position. All performances are as narrowly defined as the storytelling approach. Visually pic is disappointing with the widescreen compositions lacking boldness and drab color schemes predominating everywhere but in the foreign locales in Nicola Pecorini and William Frakers lensing. Mark Ishams score hits predictable military chords rounded out with a few exotic sounds while other production values notably the sound work are good. Locations in and around Ouarzazate Morocco fill in nicely for Yemen. Rules of EngagementProductionA Paramount release presented in association with Seven Arts Pictures of a Richard D.
