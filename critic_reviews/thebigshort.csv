By Leah Pickett The Big Short The Big Short  Directed by Adam McKay In the mid-2000s the banks that serve as the pillars of the U.S. financial system defrauded the American people caused the worst global economic crisis since the Great Depression and essentially got away with it. Only one executive went to jail for a calculated and widespread corruption that tainted every echelon of the U.S.s top-tier financial institutions from JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs to the since- collapsed Bear Stearns AIG and Lehman Brothers. Millions of Americans lost their jobs homes pensions and retirements and the big banks that survived the crash were compensated by the U.S. government with a multitrillion-dollar taxpayer bailout. What a disgrace. What a story. Adam McKay must have thought so. The Big Short a ruthless comedy based on Michael Lewiss nonfiction book The Big Short Inside the Doomsday Machine is something of a departure for McKay best known for goofball romps like Anchorman and Step Brothers. In directing The Big Short he employs a more crafty and sardonic approach lecturing testing inveigling and even dressing down his viewer to listen up damn it because the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis--as boring as it sounds when shrouded in purposefully abstruse financial jargon--is not as inscrutable as the one-percenters would have you think. The system is complex by design the film maintains to keep the insiders protected and the outsiders until their world comes crashing down around them blissfully oblivious. In fact The Big Short sees as much danger in a passive too-trusting and easily distracted culture as in Wall Streets insatiable greed or the federal governments lack of oversight. McKays gimmicks shouldnt land as well as they do but the film succeeds because its indignation is righteous and earned. Most of The Big Shorts bitter humor is injected via the fourth-wall-breaking character of Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) a Brillo-haired Wall Street trader who stares languidly into the camera with a teasing smirk on his lips. ""Its pretty confusing right?"" Vennett asks the audience after a stream of money talk. ""Doesnt it make you feel bored or stupid? Heres Margot Robbie in a bathtub to explain. . . . "" Cut to the Wolf of Wall Street actress soaking in a bubble bath and sipping a glass of wine as she delivers a primer on mortgage-backed securities. ""When you hear subprime"" Robbie warns. ""Think shit."" The celebrity cameos persist--Anthony Bourdain popping up to explain collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) while chopping fish Selena Gomez demonstrating the domino effect of synthetic CDOs by losing a game of blackjack in a casino--but they all serve a purpose. The economy may not be sexy to the masses but money itself debauchery and beautiful people most certainly are. McKay cowrote The Big Shorts screenplay with Charles Randolph (Love and Other Drugs) and they know how to keep an audience engaged broadcasting this knowledge often as both parody and indictment. The film moves at a quick clip often surprising one with a random jump cut or freeze frame as if to say ""Pay attention"" Names quotes keywords and definitions materialize onscreen as theyre spoken adding punch and clarification and just as quickly disappear. Other characters make asides to the camera to point out what is true about their interactions and what isnt keeping the audience on its toes. Flashes of mid-2000s commercials and music videos abound and popular songs of the time like Ludacris and Pharrell Williamss ""Money Maker"" are peppered throughout. But for all of the self-aware snark and superciliousness The Big Short is an underdog story at heart. Three characters in particular contribute some moral sensitivity to the otherwise jaded proceedings Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a brilliant hedge fund manager who detects the housing credit bubble in 2005 and accurately predicts its burst; Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a disillusioned former Wall Street trader turned lone wolf; and Mark Baum (Steve Carell) a principled money manager who convinces his team to begin shorting--betting against--securitized subprime home mortgages after Vennett inadvertently alerts them that the vast majority of these mortgages are fraudulent. Baum Burry Rickert and Vennett may seem well intentioned and outspoken against corruption but their motives are complicated by their knowing they could make a fortune. In the end they all profit from the crisis with Baum and Rickert expressing only a modicum of remorse for how they cashed in on other peoples pain. Burry Rickert and Baum are outsiders and though that doesnt automatically redeem them it does render them more sympathetic. Burry (the only character named after his real-life counterpart) is bothered by the reactions of others to his glass eye and antisocial behavior but he speaks his mind anyway insisting that the housing market is propped up by bad loans. Rickert is drawn back into the business by a pair of twentysomething entrepreneurs who spot trouble in the system but later chastises them for celebrating their own financial windfall. ""You know what I hate about banks?"" Rickert growls. ""They turn people into numbers."" And Baum wracked with guilt following his brothers suicide throws himself into the unpopular job of exposing injustice financial or otherwise wherever he can find it. ""He was having bad thoughts"" Baum confides in his wife when the death finally hits him. ""And my first thought was to offer him money."" Even Vennett has his conciliatory moments. At one point he reveals how ""numbers guys"" are able to assert such power over everyone else through obfuscation and alienation. They want you to think that theyre the only ones smart enough to understand he says. There have been several decent films about the 2008 financial meltdown including J.C Chandors drama Margin Call (2011) and Charles Fergusons Oscar-winning documentary Inside Job (2010). The Big Short is the most incisive. Its method of pedagogy may be too acerbic for some tastes but maybe thats what people need in this instance to be rudely shaken awake. v Trailer More Movie Review >> Tags Movie Review The Big Short Adam McKay Michael Lewis subprime mortgage crisis Wall Street Ryan Gosling Charles Randolph Christian Bale Brad Pitt Steve Carell Video Email Share Digg Newsvine del.icio.us Facebook Reddit Twitter Windy Citizen Add to favorites Saving...

The Big Short (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Big Short (R) The 2008 economic crisis recounted as a comedy starring Christian Bale Steve Carell Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/24/2015 Editor rating 3 The Big Short is an angry fiery movie disguised as a comedy. Director Adam McKay (Anchorman The Other Guys) has turned Michael Lewis dense bestseller about the 2008 economic collapse and the people who profited from it into a crackerjack comedy. The movie is paced like one of McKays Will Ferrell pictures stuffed with cameos and filled with direct addresses to the audience that lay out some of the more complicated elements of the story. If you dont know what a collateralized debt obligation is you might have a better grasp on the concept after Anthony Bourdain explains it to you from his kitchen. But there is so much information to process in The Big Short that only hedge fund managers and stock brokers will be able to track every nuance and shading of this complicated story. If you want a serious thoughtful exploration of what happened watch Charles Fergusons Oscar-winning documentary Inside Job. McKay keeps numerous plates spinning worried about boring his audience as he follows several characters (some based on real people others composites) in the years leading up to the meltdown. The one thing they all have in common They got rich while everyone else got burned. You cant blame people such as Michael Burry (Christian Bale) an eccentric genius with a glass eye and a touch of Aspergers who pored through the mortgage-backed bonds that banks started using in the late 1970s to reap giant profits. Burry was the first to realize that in 2007 many of the people who had been given loans wouldnt be able to afford their payments after the adjustable rates kicked in and that a disastrous chain of foreclosures would ensue. Burry was acting on behalf of his clients when he started shorting the banks loans investing millions of dollars into credit swap defaults that required the housing market to collapse in order to generate a profit. Other investors such as the oily shark Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) and the conscience-stricken Mark Baum (Steve Carell) took a different approach deciding to make a profit for themselves even though they knew the apocalypse was looming. McKay doesnt judge any of his protagonists He just tags along with them as they negotiate a field of credit-rating agencies corporate conventions and immoral mortgage brokers who live high on the hog by granting loans to people who dont even have a credit score. As a pair of young self-made investors who literally stumble onto the opportunity of a lifetime Finn Wittrock and John Magaro play up the humor of their characters helping you overlook the fact that these guys got rich while countless people lost everything. As their mentor and advisor Brad Pitt injects a note of crackpot gravity Hes a serious conscionable man who got out of the game years ago but hes willing to go back in briefly to help out his disciples. Pitt does however remind them that what they are doing is nothing to brag about. The characters in The Big Short arent outright criminals like Jordan Belfort was nor are they saintly representations of ethical behavior. They are all men who got a peek at the breadth of the corruption lurking beneath the global economic infrastructure realized it was doomed to fail and decided to make some money on it. Because who wouldnt? McKay is careful to include a scene in which two of the men try to get their reporter pal at the Wall Street Journal to break the story before the housing bubble burst. But the journalist declines because hes afraid of burning his sources. In The Big Short everyone is complicit in one way or another despite their level of indignation and the film ends on an alarming note that points out how easily it could all happen again. If the movie wasnt so funny youd leave the theater crying.

And it probably would have been in the hands of anyone other than director Adam McKay (""Anchorman"" ""Talladega Nights""). McKay specializes in doing frenetic humor and he brings that same energy to this story which he and Charles Randolph adapted from the book by Michael Lewis.As most realize the economic bust was driven by banks heedlessly giving out home loans to people who were underqualified to pay those loans. ""The Big Short"" follows three groups of people who foresaw the crisis to come and bet huge amounts of money against the banks thus somewhat guiltily making fortunes for themselves as much of America found itself broke and homeless.The initial visionary was Dr. Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who is a real person (others are composites or have had name changes). Burry had given up medicine for investing but he was hardly your standard business type -- he had a glass eye wore shorts and flip-flops to work and loved heavy metal. But he was also ultra-sharp and was the first to notice things were heading the wrong way and bet against the banks.An oily investment banker named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) hears about Burrys moves and convinces an investment group headed by Mark Baum (Steve Carell) to go the same way. Coincidentally a couple of small-time traders (Finn Wittrock John Magaro) working out of a garage in California hear about the trend and with the guidance of a wily retired granola-munching ex financial wiz (Brad Pitt) they go all in.Then its just a matter of waiting for the economy to collapse.McKay livens things up with sudden fiscal explanations from unlikely sources -- Margot Robbie in a bubble bath Selena Gomez at a blackjack table -- and trips to Las Vegas and Florida where the housing market is so bad that an alligator is lounging in the pool of an abandoned home. He constantly cross edits from one group to another keeping the pace madcap even goofy.And yet as the film makes clear there is nothing goofy about this. American taxpayers ended up bailing out these consciously corrupt banks retirement plans were ravaged and virtually no one went to jail. Worst of all the banks seem to be gearing up for another round.""The Big Short"" manages to be as enlightening as it is entertaining. But its ominous revelations linger long after its over.tlongdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/toomuchTomLongThe Big ShortGRADE B+Rated R for pervasive language and some sexuality/nudityRunning time 130 minutes 15 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1OmG4TV MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/12/22/movie-review-big-short-tom-long/77789294/,200,thebigshort3,thebigshort,detroitnews

And the cleverly-conceived The Big Short repeatedly breaks ""the Fourth Wall"" rule and addresses the audience in its sublime breakdown of the 2008 subprime mortgage disaster. Think of it as a series of footnotes. And comedy relief. Director Adam McKay (Step Brothers Talladega Nights) gains all kinds of serious cred for this star-filled adaptation of a book by Michael Lewis (Moneyball) about a handful of moneymen who figured out the meltdown was coming and ""shorted"" the big banks mortgage bonds (i.e. bet on them to fail). But its McKays comedy chops that really make it work. Just when you think youre losing whats going on Margot Robbie sips champagne in a bubble bath and explains derivatives to us. When some characters figure out that ""toxic assets"" are being rebundled into new funds and resold we get Anthony Bourdain using a metaphor of three-day-old fish being tossed into soup. And then theres Selena Gomez and collateralized debt obligations. Im still not ready to take the commodities exam but these episodes help break through the wall of verbiage that might otherwise prevent us from seeing The Big Short as a very human story. And in McKays hands it is. Ultimately about a dozen Wall Streeters spotted the massive fraud the banks and finance companies were pulling. It speaks to the morality of that world that none of them became whistle blowers. Instead they did what they were conditioned to do which was try to figure out how to cash in on what hits the fan. The real-life characters - played by Christian Bale Ryan Gosling Brad Pitt Steve Carell and others - more or less figured things out independently of each other. And they were an odd lot as portrayed here. For sheer intensity its hard to beat Bales portrayal of Michael Burry a lone-wolf investor who practically became Rain Man obsessively scouring thousands of individual mortgages to absorb the extent of the fraud. At home he mulls over it all locked away from his family and playing death metal drums in a soundproof room. Steve Carell also burns as Mark Baum (a pseudonym) who agrees to go collaborate on a billion-dollar short with a fast-talking young trader named Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling). Baums motivation is screwing the banks his spirit soured by a personal tragedy - although he is among the first to realize there is little noble in what theyre all doing. And Pitt plays it cool as guru Ben Rickert who comes out of retirement to play when presented with the unbelievable facts. But if these are not conventional heroes there is some delicious schadenfreude in seeing the arc of people who know the truth are laughed at and then redeemed as smug Wall Streeters lose it all. The Big Short suggests there is real-life drama (and comedy) hiding behind subjects that scare us away by their complexity. In that sense it is very much like Moneyball which had to deal with the nuts and bolts of Billy Beanes game-changing actuarial-based baseball management before telling us a story. Ultimately The Big Short should outrage us once we understand the sheer larceny that went on with other peoples money and which crippled the world economy. En route to that it entertains us.

Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount Pictures Robert Wilonsky Dallas Morning News RobertWilonsky rwilonskydallasnews.com Star-filled look at credit housing bust The Big Short is a must-see (A) Dec. 22 2015 609pm Close Sharing really is caring... Close Join the conversation... On Facebook With Robert Wilonsky Comment on one of our official threads. Share This Story Share Discuss Meh This is no joke Writer-director Adam McKays The Big Short is the companion piece to his 2010 film The Other Guys the Will Ferrell-Mark Wahlberg police-pension-system-swindle film whose end credits (see below) charted and graphed how a bailed-out Wall Street profited off the ruins of the American economy in the years following the housing markets demise.The Big Short based on the Michael Lewis book published the year The Other Guys opened is the 130-minute back story fleshed out with familiar faces -- Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Brad Pitt Christian Bale -- getting rich while everyone else goes broke when the bubble bursts in 2007 and 08. The Big Short mines the economic collapse for tragicomic gold McKay best known for titles in which Ferrell plays the soft (in the body and in the head) man-child has always made funny movies about serious things -- like say how 24-hour cable TV ruined the news or how over-parenting births unearned entitlement. No ones better at making the medicine taste like candy.But The Big Short sticks in the throat. You laugh at it only because you cant believe it was this awful -- that people were (and are) this awful. Its the horror movie soundtracked with nervous incredulous giggles wrung from the rot of the soul.Its also easily one of the best releases of 2015. Journalists love Spotlight because it makes newspapering heroic. But The Big Short does something even more impossible It makes you root for -- feel for -- men who saw the End Times coming and did nothing to stop it except pause long enough to collect the return on their investment.By the end youll finally know the difference between a credit default swap collateralized debt obligation a synthetic CDO and mortgage-backed securities. It turns jargon into a punch line and then poetry. It will make you laugh. It will make you angry. And it will scare the heck out of you by the end of its 130 minutes when you realize weve learned nothing from the sins of the recent past. There are no heroes in The Big Short only shades of villainy. Bales the barefooted nutty professor who sees the crash years before it emerges and bets the bank (someone elses) on the housing markets eventual demise. Carells the all-id hedge-funder whose mission is to break the profiteers who stole a previous life. Pitts the bearded former banker lured out of retirement by two greedy eager comers. And Goslings the over-tanned over-coiffed sleazebro who knows just how to turn the whole broken system into a billion-dollar game of Jenga hell never lose.No one gets out alive -- not the banks that sold houses to people who couldnt afford the mortgages not the credit rating agencies that sold their AAAs for pennies on the dollar to the banks and certainly not the overworked federal regulators literally hopping into bed with the banks for bigger bangs and bigger bucks.Its the bleakest movie released this year.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Ann Hornaday December 22 2015 Follow AnnHornaday ""The Big Short"" features plenty of men behaving madly including from left Vinnie Daniel (Jeremy Strong) Danny Moses (Rafe Spall) Porter Collins (Hamish Linklater) Mark Baum (Steve Carell) Chris the assistant (Jeffry Griffin) and Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling). (Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount Pictures) A manic contagious case of the jitters pervades ""The Big Short"" Adam McKays alternately ingenious and gratuitously quirky portrait of the run-up to the 2008 financial collapse. Adapted from Michael Lewiss book of the same name this spin-art collage of genres and visual styles might look like a comedy from a director best known for his collaborations with Will Ferrell. But dont believe the hype For every moment of gallows humor ""The Big Short"" is a sober-minded profoundly angry piece of agit prop as ham-handed in its outrage as in its attempts to couch its wordy economics lessons in slick vignettes and winking gimmicks. [Michael Lewis explains and demystifies how things work on Wall Street] ""The Big Short"" revolves around three sets of players a money manager named Mark Baum (Steve Carell) a reclusive former banker named Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) and Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a visionary fund manager in California who in 2005 sees a housing market teetering on the brink of Depression-era foreclosure rates. Ignoring the objections of his investors Burry decides to bet against the historically rock-solid mortgage bond market. When he travels to Wall Street to create a financial instrument to short the market his strategy comes to the attention of Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) a spray-tanned carefully permed trader who acts as ""The Big Shorts"" swaggering clench-jawed narrator. [Steve Carell hopes ""The Big Short"" makes you want to throw up""] A madcap montage of expository speeches hyperventilating meetings revelatory encounters with corrupt brokers and their hapless marks ""The Big Short"" feels less like an immersive story than a lecture delivered by the hippest Econ 101 professor on campus illustrated with glib asides and state-of-the-art visual aids. Punctuated by occasional collages of snippets from Madison Avenue MTV and McKay and Ferrells website Funny or Die (thats McKays daughter Pearl in a blink-and-youll-miss-it clip) ""The Big Short"" will resort to anything to grab the audiences attention even if it means having a character deliver his lines while brushing his teeth or stopping the movie dead in its tracks for a celebrity tutorial on subprime mortgages or debt repackaging. Michael Burry (Christian Bale) predicted the housing market crash and made millions for himself and other investors. (Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount Pictures) That approach works until McKays control begins to slip Unlike ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" (which is explicitly invoked in one of those celebrity cameos) ""The Big Short"" cant exactly be accused of celebrating the greedy bro culture its indicting. But McKay cant slow down long enough to let the information unfold naturally by way of the story and organic design elements. ""Moneyball"" another Lewis adaptation that Pitt produced and starred in possessed its share of arcana but that movie handled abstract factoids with far more grace and organic humor. Here McKay takes viewers by the lapels and shakes them until theyre dizzied and dumbfounded allowing the cinematic equivalent of look books and mood boards to do the narrative heavy lifting for him. Shot by Barry Ackroyd with the shaky-cam lensing he made famous in the Jason Bourne movies and ""The Hurt Locker"" ""The Big Short"" winds up being a woozily punch-drunk assault on the senses which makes it all the more remarkable when the actors manage to deliver sharp performances amid the circling bluebirds. Gosling and Pitt are particularly impressive as two sides of the same Mephistophelian coin and Carell plays Baums moralistic crusader with barking wounded authenticity although Baums teammates -- played by Hamish Linklater Rafe Spall and Jeremy Strong -- are arguably more interesting. Bales twitchy stuttering portrayal of Burry might be the weakest point of a film that winds up collapsing Marxs dictum to repeat recent history as tragedy and farce in one busy bouncy ball. The effect is distracting aggressive and finally psychically numbing. Upon leaving ""The Big Short"" audiences are likely to feel less enlightened than bludgeoned with a blunt instrument albeit one wrapped in layers of eye-catching silks and spangles You may be too old to cry but it hurts too much to laugh.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The great American tradition of filling ones pockets with other peoples money has inspired milestones from ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" to ""Oceans Eleven"" ""Wall Street"" and ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" The dizzying comic thriller ""The Big Short"" joins that class of ""follow the money"" classics. Its a dazzling muckraking story about financially corrupt banksters committing the biggest fraud in U.S. history. The film is adapted from author Michael Lewis ""The Big Short Inside the Doomsday Machine."" That nonfiction account followed the massive 2008 mortgage bubble as it triggered financial collapse blowing the nations economy to smithereens. If you dont clearly remember that Armageddon take a minute to look at your retirement plan. I will wait until you stop crying. This seems like an incongruous topic for director Adam McKay a past master of goofball gems like ""Anchorman"" and ""Step Brothers."" Yet he proves himself a gifted versatile filmmaker who understands how to entertain without obscuring a message. McKay makes a smart snarky crisis tragicomedy from the real estate boom and bust. His film balances sardonic character sketches with sober mockery of a culture gone mad with market mania. The heroes of the tale -- sort of -- are Steve Carell Christian Bale Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt all bright and interesting actors doing standout work. They play a diverse group of renegade investment specialists -- Goslings narration calls them ""a few weirdos and outsiders"" -- suspicious that America is about to jump off a cliff of toxic assets. These smart men are admirable in the ways they fathom the imminent unholy mess. They observed that the real estate boom driven in part by risky mortgages for bottom-rung buyers (no-income no-job ""ninjas"") was circling the toilet bowl. Those iffy loans packaged into overrated bonds would collapse. But the downfall could make immense fortunes for traders betting against the market (and the economy) in the form of credit-default swaps. The central focus is a labyrinthine situation involving Wall Street jargon about pooled loans and liability structure tranches. This is the sort of thing that stretches creative ingenuity to the breaking point but McKay explains it in plain English through the most unlikely interpreters. Breaking the fourth wall he enlists actress Margot Robbie -- the blond bombshell from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" -- for a bubble bath soliloquy directly addressing viewers to define mortgage bonds. Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain cooks us a stew of leftover fish to explain collateralized debt obligations. The film bustles with flashbacks and inspired subtle effects like the hushed buzzing of flies when a pair of market researchers visit a Florida housing development thats all but abandoned. Moments like these make the frequently surreal film oddly realistic and grounded. What better way to represent the coming downfall of the market than by pushing over a tower of Jenga blocks? Photos by Paramount Pictures Christian Bale (above) plays a hedge-fund savant in ""The Big Short."" At top Steve Carell (center) and Ryan Gosling (right) sense the imminent financial meltdown -- which isnt exactly a popular position. McKay keeps the story human by giving his money men a taste for childish insult humor and some excruciating personal issues. There are no outright heroes or villains in ""The Big Short."" The central characters arent thieves; Carells brokerage trader believes the banking system is corrupt. Hes an annoying but decent man haunted by the feeling that he should have offered his late brother attention that could have saved his life. But what does that guilt mean in the next moral dilemma he has to face? Bales hedge fund manager is a hyper-energetic genius who is painfully awkward socially. Yet as the bubble approaches everyones actions are geared to do what is advantageous to them. They focus on betting against the economic system to make a bundle not do what would prevent or smooth the bubble. Sharks are sharks. They attack food not ethical dilemmas. One senses that McKay created ""The Big Short"" from passion deftly linking his characters public follies to private frailties. Watching this polished impactful film is like listening to a record where practically every song is a potential hit single.

Updated July 30 2016  253 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews The Big Short is a sharp comedy with a first-rate cast By Calvin Wilson St. Louis Post-Dispatch Calvin Wilson Dec 22 2015 (...) Michael Burry (Christian Bale) is kind of eccentric -- he walks around his office barefoot -- but hes savvy about the stock market and unimpressed with the conventional wisdom. So when he notices shaky mortgage practices Burry is quick to conclude that a bubble of historic proportions is set to burst -- and just as quick to bet against or ""short"" the housing market.That move attracts the interest of several other financial players including bank trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) and hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell). Off to the side of the action is Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a disillusioned former banker whos not particularly surprised that Wall Street has gone too far.Baum is uncomfortable with exploiting the situation for personal gain and appalled when he discovers just how catastrophic the collapse of the housing market could be. Burry cant believe that so many people cant seem to face up to the truth. And Vennett cant wait for the house of cards to come crashing down. Based on a best-selling book by Michael Lewis about folks who anticipated the financial crisis of 2008 ""The Big Short"" is the film that ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" wanted to be.Working from a screenplay that he co-wrote with Charles Randolph director Adam McKay departs from the broad comedy of ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" to deliver a financial farce with satirical sting. Of course Wall Street jargon can be impenetrable so McKay hilariously breaks it down through tactics including onscreen text and celebrity cameos.The cast is first-rate. Gosling is the essence of the smooth operator whos always working an angle. Pitt and Bale clearly relish the opportunity to disappear into their characters. And Carell nails Baums intriguing blend of self-righteousness and empathy.Far from being a dry economics lesson ""The Big Short"" is an unsparing look at corporate skullduggery and its consequences -- and the rare mainstream film with political bite.

"The Big Short shows that even sharks get the blues review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Big Short shows that even sharks get the blues reviewThe Big Short made by Anchormans Adam McKay uses both comedy and drama as it works to make us root for profiteers who tried to cash in on the economic meltdown of 2007-08.By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Dec. 22 2015The Big ShortStarring Ryan Gosling Steve Carell Christian Bale and Brad Pitt. Directed by Adam McKay. Opens Dec. 23 at GTA theatres. 130 minutes. 14A Much is made in The Big Short both in jest and in deadly earnestness about the impenetrability of the 2007-08 economic meltdown it chronicles.To be sure arcane financial terms like ""credit default swaps"" and ""bespoke tranche opportunity"" are hard to grasp even for people who use them. Fumbling in the dark is a big part of what the movie is about.Article Continued BelowDirector Adam McKay uses amusingly instructive celebrity cameos -- including a beauty in a bubble bath and a beast in chefs garb -- to make swallowing the narrative medicine easy.Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling star in The Big Short.  (Paramount Pictures)  When you get right down to it though The Big Short is actually pretty simple a small number of maverick investors ""outsiders and weirdos"" played by Ryan Gosling Steve Carell Christian Bale and Brad Pitt foresaw the subprime mortgage collapse of 2007 and sought to profit from it.They ""shorted"" the mortgage bubble betting against the U.S. economy -- and thus the global one. They profited from the misery of a multitude of homeowners and small investors.Unlucky little guys and gals dont get much screen time in The Big Short one of the films few faults. McKay best known for such comedies as Anchorman and Step Brothers wants us to root for people who would be villains or dupes in other money movies such as 99 Homes and Inside Job.People like Goslings venal bank trader Jared Vennett Steve Carells harried hedge fund boss Mark Baum Bales barefoot investment manager Mike Burry and Pitts Yoda-ish money mentor Ben Rickert all composites drawn from the book by Moneyballs Michael Lewis. (McKay co-wrote the screenplay with Charles Randolph.)The really neat feat of The Big Short is getting us to care about these dollar-hungry sharks and other erstwhile profiteers and to laugh at their desperate dealings even if we dont always understand what it is theyre doing (a second viewing really helps). A couple of them even have semblances of a conscience like people in a sci-fi alien invasion movie who cant get the masses to understand that disaster looms. The film also warns that the greed stupidity and dirty deals behind the subprime mortgage debacle persist and could easily cause more mayhem.As Led Zeppelins darkly prophetic ""When The Levee Breaks"" sounds on the rock-and-rap soundtrack were advised that the above-mentioned ""bespoke tranche opportunity"" is the 2015 buzz phrase to fear if a repeat of recent history is to be avoided.Which is all the more reason to watch The Big Short again.Read more about Ryan Gosling Brad PittThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Based on Michael Lewis book.Steve Carrell (left) and Ryan Gosling portray financial players who were one of the few to see the 2008 housing market crash coming in ""The Big Short.""(Photo Paramount Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4.5 stars out of 5The film while sobering is endlessly entertainingThe cast is first-rate and everyone is all-in particularly Ryan Gosling""The Big Short"" manages to entertain you while making you really really mad.And sad. And incredulous. Adam McKays take on the financial meltdown of 2008 and the handful of people who saw it coming weaves bitter humor through an educational journey that ultimately ends in tragedy. For all of us. In some ways its a horror story Many of the culprits are still at large.The film based on Michael Lewis book (as was ""Moneyball"" another supposedly unfilmable work that turned out pretty swell) is relentlessly entertaining with a star-studded cast (Brad Pitt Steve Carell Ryan Gosling and Christian Bale among a host of others) effortlessly operating at the top of their game.The housing market was considered the one rock-solid investment. When a few smart folks started suspecting that it was instead a bubble that might soon burst supposedly smarter folks told them no. Impossible. Wont happen. Couldnt happen.Why not?Um because it never has. And were greedy. Go back to your desks and keep selling loans to people no matter if theyre qualified.Some people didnt listen. This movie offers a look at some of them (real and not). And it is an uproarious ride from start to finish.Dr. Michael Burry (Bale) is a socially backward fund manager who blasts death metal (and plays along with a drum kit in his office). He sees an unsustainable future for housing and starts betting against the market -- ""shorting"" it -- with his clients money. Bankers are thrilled to cheat him (so they think) and his bosses are exceptionally unhappy but Burry doesnt care (at all) about either.Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (John Magaro) started their own fund while they were still in college. Theyve made a lot of money but not real money not in the context of this world. They want to and they accidentally happen across a report that recommends shorting the housing market. (Except they didnt. In one of many instances of breaking the fourth wall the duo tell us this isnt really how it happened. More on McKays technique later.)They know theyre out of their league so they call in Ben Rickert (Pitt) a granola-crunching mentor who stepped away from the game but still knows how its played.Ryan Gosling (left) stars in ""The Big Short"" a film about the housing market crash of 2008. (Photo Paramount Pictures)Then theres Mark Baum (Carell) a hedge-fund manager with a bad attitude toward banks. He has his reasons more than the rest but you get the feeling they only made the bile worse.The tour guide is Jared Vennett (Gosling) a subprime specialist at Deutsche Bank who is certain things will crash. Hes slick as a weasel (and in Goslings all-in portrayal hilarious) but so sure of himself he convinces Baum hes right.So here we have isolated people who stand to make billions on a bet that only they see as a near-sure thing even when government and financial ""experts"" belittle them. This is the stuff of a classic David-and-Goliath tale -- except that when Goliath goes down so does the U.S. economy and millions of people holding bad loans with it. Pitts Rickert is the movies moral compass reminding Shipley and Geller they shouldnt gloat (and dance) on the backs of others.AZCENTRALThe Big Short (2016) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsYet in a scenario that has few good guys our gang comes closest. Its difficult to root for them when that means rooting against the economy and your own wallet. But McKay who has worked most famously with Will Ferrell (the ""Anchorman"" movies for instance) uses their formidable talents and personalities in such a way that makes it nearly impossible not to.Also Not everyone is versed in economic theory so McKay brings in help. Margot Robbie reclining in a bubble bath with champagne explains mortgage-backed securities. Anthony Bourdain lays out collateralized debt obligations or CDOs. Selena Gomez and actual economist Richard H. Thaler have a go at synthetic CDOs. It sounds silly but its not -- its absurd and thats an important distinction. The whole rotten business was absurd and thats what McKay is showing us (not that we didnt know).This is hardly the first film to explore similar themes. ""Margin Call"" was terrific if smaller in scale. ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" got caught up in the force of Leonardo DiCaprios performance diluting the universal theme Martin Scorsese was going for.AZCENTRALYear in Review 2015 Goodykoontzs 10 worst moviesBut McKay of all people finds the right balance and reminds us that sometimes its better to laugh if only so we dont cry.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Steve Carell (left) and Ryan Gosling star in The Big Short.(Photo Jaap Buitendijk)Putting Margot Robbie in a bubbly hot tub and having her explain risky mortgages is one way to make a movie about financial scandal somewhat palatable.The subject matter is dry but at least its made entertaining in director Adam McKays The Big Short (1/2 out of four; rated R; expands nationwide Wednesday) a tragi-comic satire of sorts about iffy dealings in the housing industry and how a small group of people could see the 2008 financial crisis coming years before America had to bail out its banks.McKay uses A-list talent and creative filmmaking to go with subprime rates and credit debt though what it amounts to is the hypercool version of a boring economics lesson you slept through in college.USA TODAYSteve Carell Adam McKay bring serious history to Big ShortThe Big Short revolves around the young bros and old white guys who were the villains of the burst housing bubble of the mid-2000s though the movies main characters are the ones who foresee the series of bad home loans and future defaults that will ultimately lead to a spectacular market collapse.Michael Burry (Christian Bale) an eccentric money manager who air-drums to Metallica and works math in his bare feet is the first to see the impending disaster. The folks at his company think hes mad as a hatter but young wheeling-and-dealing banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) believes Burry might be on to something. He talks hedge-fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) an emotional guy dealing with personal and professional issues and his analysts into pouring millions of investment dollars into a scheme of credit default swaps.Theres a lot of shouting and stressing out as they all try to make their millions while the rest of the country tilts closer to rampant unemployment and turmoil.USA TODAYBig Short 5 things to know about Christian Bales real-life characterBale is a spectacular sight as the oddball Burry whom no one takes seriously though he knows more than most everyone. Carell is also outstanding in giving the edgy Baum a tortured soul and Gosling does his smarmy best at making Vennett hateable but charming and breaking the fourth wall often as the audiences self-confident narrator.Brad Pitt also turns in a quiet and very bearded performance as Ben Rickert a former banker and now doomsday prepper who helps a couple of youngsters (Finn Wittrock and John Magaro) get their foot into the racket too.Known for broad comedies such as Talladega Nights and Anchorman McKay tries to put a humorous touch on his and Charles Randolphs screenplay based on Michael Lewis book The Big Short Inside the Doomsday Machine. Some of it works -- ""Whenever you hear subprime think (crap)"" is one of Baums choice lines -- but celebrity cameos and stock art go only so far in making sense of mortgage rates and inside-baseball financial dealings to the common moviegoer.It all comes down to men behaving badly and greed rules all though at least youll laugh and seethe along the way. 86 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1Ol7n0P",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/12/22/review-the-big-short-movie/77672250/,200,thebigshort12,thebigshort,usatoday

EntertainmentMovies The Big Short weirdly fascinating Wall Street shenanigans Originally published December 22 2015 at 1201 am Updated December 25 2015 at 802 am ""The Big Short"" cast includes from left Rafe Spall Jeremy Strong Steve Carell Ryan Gosling and Jeffry Griffin. (Jaap Buitendijk/AP) Movie review of ""The Big Short"" Arcane financial verbiage and revved-up performances by the likes of Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling combine to make this Wall Street drama often baffling yet weirdly fascinating. Rating 3.5 stars out of 4. Share story By Soren AndersenSeattle Times movie reviewer Look its complicated. In ""The Big Short"" arcane dialogue flies thick and fast. Terms like ""tranche"" and ""credit default swap"" and a hailstorm of abbreviations -- CDO FICO and a word-salad myriad others -- whiz by in such profusion that before long it all seems to spell C-O-N-F-U-S-I-O-N for anyone without a background in the world of high finance or who hasnt read the Michael Lewis best-seller on which the picture is based. The words fountain from the mouths of Type A guys in suits in offices and somehow all that talk -- and ""The Big Short"" is virtually all talk -- very quickly becomes weirdly fascinating. Its made so by the caliber of the actors talking that talk -- most notably Christian Bale Steve Carell Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt -- and the supercharged intensity they bring to the delivery of the verbiage. Movie Review 1/2   The Big Short with Christian Bale Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Brad Pitt Margot Robbie. Directed by Adam McKay from a screenplay by McKay and Charles Randolph based on the book ""The Big Short Inside the Doomsday Machine"" by Michael Lewis. 130 minutes. Rated R for pervasive language and some sexuality/nudity. Several theaters. What theyre talking about is in one of the most unambiguous statements in the picture ""the worst financial crisis of modern times."" That would be the housing bubble and the bursting of same in late 2008 that sent the U.S. economy into a tailspin from which it has yet to fully recover. Related story What The Big Short gets right and wrong about the housing bubble The characters in ""The Big Short"" arent involved in causing the crash but they detect its on the way through analysis of market trends and figure out how to bet against the economy -- and make gazillions by doing so. Theyre a quirky crew. Bales character is an analytical genius with no social skills. He digs deep into data identifies the coming apocalypse tries to warn other big-money types and has his warning dismissed. In the standout performance of the picture a revved-up Carell plays a hedge fund manager with an abrasive manner and a conscience the latter making him an exception in that milieu. Gosling plays the opposite a sleekly tailored sleaze of a Wall Street banker who is a smug cynic and thinks hes the most brilliant guy on the planet. Pitts character is an investor who has stepped off the fast track and becomes a kind of grouchy guru to two naive young money managers. Director/co-screenwriter Adam McKay whose background is comedy (""Anchorman"" ""Talladega Nights"") lightens things up by having characters break the fourth wall now and then to explain in simplified terms whats really going on. In one scene it announces that Margot Robbie the striking blonde from ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" will make clear the intricacies of mortgage-backed securities. Cut to Miss Robbie. In a bubble bath. Sipping Champagne. And her explanation does make sense. Sort of. But I somehow wound up focusing on those bubbles slowly bursting and ... Huh? Where was I? Oh yeah. See the movie. Its a treat.

Paramount Pictures AP The Big Short      (out of five) Director Adam McKay Cast Christian Bale Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Rated R (pervasive strong language sexuality) Running time 130 min. Related links Comedy director Adam McKay gets serious with The Big Short By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 954pm on Monday Dec. 21 2015 Monday Dec. 21 2015 Friday Dec. 25 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The financial crisis and subsequent Great Recession that hit in 2007-2008 was the source of much global grief and heartache. The Big Short tells the flip side of this tragedy about those who saw it coming and profited from it.But this isnt just another greed-is-great orgy a la The Wolf of Wall Street. Simultaneously sobering and entertaining The Big Short carefully explores the guilt that comes with profiting from pain and inflicting misery on so many. The result is one of the best and most resonant films of 2015. Based on the nonfiction bestseller by Michael Lewis this fictionalized film from director Adam McKay -- up to now known more for the broad humor of the ""Anchorman"" movies -- is set in the world of the upstart geniuses and fund managers who in 2005 began to sense that the economy and more specifically the housing market was due for a major crash.At the heart of the story is Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a doctor heavy-metal fan and financial savant who has built an investment company based on his uncanny instincts. Against all advice he dives heavily into credit default swaps basically betting the housing industry would tank at a time when common wisdom said that was impossible.His unorthodox behavior attracts the attention of Deutsche Bank trader Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who persuades fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and his team to get involved.Similarly two young Colorado hotshots -- Charlie (John Magaro) and Jamie (Finn Wittrock) -- hear about what hes doing and want a piece of the action. Their mentor Ben Rickert (a low-key Brad Pitt) tells them its a smart move. If the economy crashes and burns all involved get unfathomably rich.The movie works as a companion piece to 99 Homes a film from this year about a laid-off construction worker who loses his house during the recession. Both films capture the deep sense of desperation that comes with a financial crisis and the collateral damage thats left in its path. As with Spotlight the film about a newspapers expose of the Roman Catholic Churchs sex abuse scandal much of The Big Short involves people sitting around computer screens delivering dialogue. But McKay working from a screenplay he co-wrote with Charles Randolph rescues the movie from being a static experience with a playful sense of humor (cutting in snippets of pop-culture and news events of the time) and constantly smashing the fourth wall. The likes of Anthony Bourdain Wolf of Wall Street star Margot Robbie and Goslings character -- as well as onscreen title cards -- provide interstitial lessons on just what credit default swaps tranches ISDA and CDOs are.It all makes for engrossing moviegoing and a timely economics lesson.

"Big Short The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; big-short-the ) Big Short The (United States 2015) December 21 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Against all odds The Big Short works. In fact ""works"" is an understatement for what director Adam McKay has achieved with his improbable adaptation of Michael Lewis nonfiction book about the 2008 global financial crisis. Writing in Vanity Fairs December 2015 issue Lewis says the following ""My job as I saw it was to make the reader badly want to know about credit-default swaps and collateralized debt obligations."" This in turn became McKays obligation when he made the movie. And one of the major reasons The Big Short succeeds is because McKay does this. Using gallows humor likable protagonists and a variety of nonstandard filmmaking techniques (like having characters address the audience directly) McKay maintains a high level of energy for more than two hours and dares us to become bored. The Big Short merges narrative elements with a pseudo-documentary exhumation of what happened during the years leading up to the 2008 collapse. The characters are all either real-life people who told their stories to Lewis or slightly fictionalized versions (with the names changed to protect the guilty). The film is both instructive and highly entertaining. McKay goes out of his way to inform viewers about the underlying causes of the instability but he does so with tongue-in-cheek irreverence. One device he employs is to hijack celebrities to provide explanations. Margot Robbie gives a lesson while enjoying a bubble bath. (Admittedly its tough to concentrate on what shes saying). Celebrity chef Anthony Bordain uses a fish stew analogy. And Selena Gomez plays blackjack. This is more in McKays wheelhouse than one might initially assume. The former SNL writer has previously directed a handful of features - all comedies (including Anchorman and its sequel). That background is an asset for The Big Short. The comedic edge gives the film greater resonance. Not only does it leaven the heavier material but it impels the narrative with a natural momentum.  The snarky tone will appeal to those who have always been distrustful of Wall Streets business practices. McKay in no way uses this for humorous sport however; theres a deep current of anger and outrage underlying the comedy. The Big Short cherry picks characters from the book - not every person profiled by Lewis makes it to the screen. The focus is on five individuals Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a socially awkward financial genius; Mark Baum (Steve Carell) a broker with a conscience; Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) a rapacious investor out to make a killing; and the duo of Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) a couple of amateurs who see the opportunity of a lifetime. Burry is the first one to identify the dangers inherent in the way Wall Street is overvaluing bonds backed by sub-prime mortgages. As early as 2005 he is sounding the alarm bell but no one is listening. So he turns this into an investment opportunity by ""shorting"" the bonds - essentially betting that the housing market will collapse. Vennett reaches the same conclusion and discusses it with Baum who after a private investigation agrees with him. Geller and Shipley are in the right place at the right time and acting under the advice of ex-broker Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) get a seat at the big boys table. Christian Bale who is no stranger to radical appearance changes de-glamorizes himself in order to portray Burry. Bale adopts some of Burrys mannerisms and idiosyncrasies (such as his preference for always being barefoot) and believably conveys the sometimes off-putting personality of a man afflicted with Aspergers Syndrome. Not to be outdone Steve Carell submerges his physicality and personality although by nature Baum isnt as compelling an individual as Burry. While Bale and Carell have the most screen time a host of other big-name players make appearances including Ryan Gosling Brad Pitt Melissa Leo Marisa Tomei and Mark Strong. This is the second unorthodox feature adaptation of one of Lewis books and is fundamentally more successful than Moneyball. It was possible to fashion the 2011 movie into a slightly off-kilter bio-pic. The Big Short because of the necessity of educating viewers about a variety of terms and processes necessitated a different approach. McKay (along with his co-screenwriter Charles Randolph) found the ""sweet spot."" As a result The Big Short works not only on a narrative level but as a teaching device and it achieves the latter without seeming to talk down to an audience. There have been other movies about stock market corruption. Most like Wall Street and J.C. Chandors Margin Call (also about 2008) view the situation through the lens of a thriller. McKay like Martin Scorsese in The Wolf of Wall Street illustrates that comedy can be an effective tool in telling a story like this provided its used with scalpel-like precision. The cuts made by The Big Short are deep and devastating in what they reveal about how 2008 happened and tellingly how little has changed since then.

Entertainment Ryan Goslings New Movie Goes Too Far To Try To Make The Economic Crisis Fun How much sugar does it take to make some serious economic crisis messaging go down? Anchorman director Adam McKay tries to figure it out in The Big Short. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling in The Big Short. Paramount Pictures ID 7562989 ""Mortgage-backed securities subprime loans tranches -- its pretty confusing right?"" slick-to-the-touch banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) asks in voiceover not far into The Big Short. ""Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid? Well its supposed to. Wall Street loves to use confusing terms to make you think only they can do what they do. Or even better for you to just leave them the fuck alone."" And then to alleviate those issues he introduces Margot Robbie as herself in all her golden pulchritude drinking champagne while sitting in a bubble bath and explaining in her native Aussie accent to the camera what exactly those terms mean. View this image > Christian Bale in The Big Short. Jaap Buitendijk / Paramount Pictures ID 7563017 Its not the only time The Big Short enlists a celebrity to deliver a particularly knotty bit of financial terminology. Whenever it gets to an especially tricky concept either a famous figure shows up to talk the audience through it or Gosling in his role as the narrator as well as a character in the story breaks the fourth wall to do it himself. And there are a lot of concepts to grapple with here because The Big Short adapted from Moneyball author Michael Lewiss nonfiction book of the same name aims to do nothing less than explain everything that caused the 2008 economic crisis and why it could absolutely happen again.In a crazily noble and doomed way The Big Short is an educational movie for grown-ups. That Robbie scene is a miniature version of what the film attempts to do as a whole -- to enlist big stars like Gosling Christian Bale Steve Carell and Brad Pitt in order to make palatable a complicated scenario with an end result that everyones painfully familiar with. It has ahead of its release been described as a companion to The Wolf of Wall Street Martin Scorseses excessive enjoyable portrait of a master of the universe as an unrepentant douchebag only with a conscience. But its more like an advanced version of those Sesame Street sketches in which someone like Mark Ruffalo shows up to explain the vocab word ""empathy"" to Murray Monster. View this image > Hamish Linklater and Rafe Spall in The Big Short. Jaap Buitendijk / Paramount Pictures ID 7563067 Its characters are a collection of finance industry outsiders who all spot what everyone in the heart of the banking world remains blind to -- that theres a housing bubble due to burst. Bale plays Michael Burry an eccentric California-based neurologist turned hedge fund manager while John Magaro and Finn Wittrock are younglings from Colorado who started a hedge fund in their garage and who enlist the help of a former banker turned survivalist named Ben Rickert played by Pitt to bet big on credit failure. Carell plays the fractious Mark Baum a money manager based on Steve Eisman whose team (which includes Hamish Linklater Rafe Spall and Jeremy Strong) gets involved with Goslings character based on Deutsche Bank mortgage trader Greg Lippmann.If that sounds like a whole lot of finance types to keep track of as they each pursue a path toward making a fortune off the demise of the American economy well none of them really matter. Theyre vehicles for delivering more information about what went wrong and how to the audience. View this image > Finn Wittrock and John Magaro in The Big Short. Jaap Buitendijk / Paramount Pictures ID 7563038 Baum and his posse take field trips to Florida to examine stretches of homes whose mortgages are underwater talking to strippers leveraged to the hilt on multiple houses and the smirking brokers who helped them get there. They along with some other characters travel to Las Vegas for the American Securitization Forum where they dont bother to keep the contempt or disbelief off their faces while talking to indifferent SEC agents and banker bros who groan ""Please stop being such a buzzkill"" when anyone tries to get serious.The Big Short is directed by Adam McKay the former SNL head writer best known for highly quotable stupid-smart comedies like Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy and Step Brothers. The Big Short is a comedy only in that its not really a drama -- it doesnt do jokes really but it does maintain a light touch and documentary-style camerawork that evokes a sprawling high-stakes version of The Office in which a small set of characters have magically been awakened to the greed arrogance and obliviousness of all of their colleagues. View this image > Brad Pitt in The Big Short. Paramount Pictures ID 7563094 McKay is a famous and prolific purveyor of comedy but hes always had an angry relevant streak -- The Other Guys his 2010 Will Ferrell-Mark Wahlberg buddy cop comedy rolled its credits alongside graphics illustrating facts about the financial crisis and the countrys growing income inequality. The Big Short is like that section blown up into a full feature and its excellent intentions are only undermined by how boring it really believes its subject matter to be. McKay who wrote the screenplay with Charles Randolph approaches his material with a spoonful-of-sugar mentality Here are some movie stars here are cutaways to keep talky scenes interesting and heres economist Richard H. Thaler with Selena Gomez to explain synthetic CDOs.And between those dashes of sweetness are giant chunks of undisguised didacticism characters delivering lectures all but to camera (or sometimes right to it). McKays problem is that while he feels strongly that the events hes chronicling are urgent and essential he also assumes that no one else will without his tap-dancing as fast as he can. Rather than have faith that theres something interesting about this subject matter -- subject matter from a book compelling enough to spend 28 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list -- he lays it out all dry and with the occasional touch of condescension then adds trimming to make it more appealing like a giant plate of boiled broccoli sprinkled with a handful of bacon bits. View this image > Strong Spall Linklater Carell Jeffry Griffin and Gosling in the Big Short. Jaap Buitendijk / Paramount Pictures ID 7563119 The Big Short is a movie about the financial crisis how our economy failed because everyone in a place of power was incentivized to do irresponsible things that benefited them at the cost of the greater system and about how the lack of consequences and regulations means were all surely doomed to repeat ourselves. But it ends up feeling like an equally depressing movie about the entertainment industry and about how someone at the top of the comedy game feels the only way for a mainstream movie to tackle this kind of serious subject matter is to trick people into watching it.Not even Margot Robbie and her champagne flute can make that look good.

"The Big Short starring Ryan Gosling Steve Carell and Christian Bale reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Big Short Gets Big Laughs out of the 2008 Economic Collapse--but Its Still a Tragedy The Big Short Gets Big Laughs out of the 2008 Economic Collapse--but Its Still a Tragedy Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 10 2015 1239 PM Bubble Boys The antic Big Short plays the collapse of 2008 for laughs--but its still a tragedy. By Dana Stevens Christian Bale as Michael Burry in The Big Short. Photo courtesy of Paramount Pictures ""Explain it to me like Im a golden retriever"" asked the investment banker played by Jeremy Irons in Margin Call as he faced the imminent collapse of his firm in the 2008 financial crisis. Those of us with a golden retrievers comprehension of the financial markets laughed appreciatively but in The Big Short writer-director Adam McKay finds a more human way into the crisis. The Big Short more comedic than Margin Call but by the end no less tragic explains it to us--""it"" being the murky process by which a housing-market bubble somehow turned into a global financial catastrophe--not as if were friendly floppy eared pets but as if were intelligent human beings. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. One of the most appealing things about this very appealing movie--a stylistic Chex Mix of storytelling satire advocacy and clip art--is its high regard for the intellect of the viewer who is at times addressed directly by the films characters or by celebrities playing themselves in pop-up cameos. The Big Short adapted from Michael Lewis 2010 nonfiction book proceeds on the assumption that not only are Americans capable of understanding exactly what happened to our money in the wake of the events of 2008 but we deserve to understand it--indeed that its our moral duty to do so. Advertisement Moral duty and comedy arent usually the comfiest of bedfellows but McKay--best known for his dumb-and-proud comic collaborations with Will Ferrell including Talladega Nights Step Brothers and the Anchorman movies--mingles righteous outrage with intermittent fits of giggling. You havent seen credit default swaps explained until youve seen Ryan Gosling in a hideous curly wig stacking Jenga blocks to illustrate the concept for a group of skeptical investors. As they begin to catch on the concept so do we which only increases our outrage. (Boiled down to a point that even an overbred poodle like me can understand it A lot of bad mortgages are bundled together rubber-stamped with an AA rating and then sold off as good investment products to unsuspecting buyers. The ""big short"" of the title is the bet the few analysts whove uncovered the scam make on the likelihood those investments will fail.) You havent seen credit default swaps explained until youve seen Ryan Gosling in a hideous curly wig stacking Jenga blocks. Gosling plays Deutsche Bank doutsche bag Jared Vennett who narrates the films opening segment introducing us to many principal characters. As Jared warns hes hardly the movies hero--only a cynical playboy whos sharp enough to take advantage of the opportunity few investors have the foresight to see coming. One who does is Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a San Jose-based doctor turned private money manager whose difficulty in relating to the social world may have something to do with his uncanny skill at number-crunching. (Though the films primary characters are versions of real-life figures in Lewis book Burry is the only one to appear under his own name.) While obsessively going over some mortgage bond assets one day the beyond-eccentric Burry--who likes to work barefoot in shorts while blasting heavy metal--notices how many of the home loans bundled into the bonds are headed for default. When Burry goes around asking investment banks for opportunities to bet against the housing market hes literally laughed out of the room (though in between guffaws the banks take his money). Soon a few younger Wall Street investors including Vennett and a pair of fumbling startup entrepreneurs played by Finn Wittrock and John Magaro catch wind of Burrys default-swap idea and begin pitching it to financiers--including former banker Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) now a reclusive health-food zealot whos reluctant to be associated with the whole dirty game. If theres anything remotely approaching a hero in this roiling carnival of opportunism and greed its the temperamental hedge-fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) based on the real-life Big Shorter Steve Eisman. Mark has buried his grief over a recent family tragedy in stress and overwork. When his wife (Marisa Tomei) begs him to slow down and get help he barks ""I love my job. I love my job. I LOVE MY JOB"" in a voice about as loving as a jackhammer. Mark at first distrusts the new investment tools being touted by the unctuous Vennett. But when he and his team (a wiseass trio played by Rafe Spall Hamish Linklater and Jeremy Strong) travel to Miami to investigate the state of the supposedly booming housing market a depressing encounter with two ethics-free mortgage brokers--along with the gator in an abandoned homes swimming pool--convinces them that the bubble is indeed about to burst. As one of the first investors to realize what that will mean not only for his own firms success but for the nations economic future Marks character takes on a tragic dimension in the movies last third. In the end The Big Short becomes the dramatic showcase Carell thought he had in Foxcatcher. Mark Baum has the moral complexity (and complex character arc) that movies cold-fish billionaire lacked. Carell keenly conveys this miserable mans conflicted relationship to his own success Hes about to be proven right make a killing in the market and get filthy rich--while untold numbers of his fellow citizens lose their jobs homes and savings because of the same chicanery that made his score possible. The screenplay co-written by McKay and Charles Randolph dismantles prettified cliches about ""moral hazard"" and ""complex financial instruments"" to reveal the simpler uglier words bundled into them like so many bad mortgages Fraud. Theft. Lies. These plain-spoken deconstructions of financial jargon are delivered direct to camera as tongue-in-cheek PSAs--most memorably by the dazzling Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street) who sips champagne in a bathtub while sensually breaking down abstruse financial concepts. Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain likens the housing scam to restaurants that hide three-day-old fish in overpriced seafood stew. A distinguished behavioral economist shows up to play a hand of blackjack with Selena Gomez by way of explaining the ""hot hand fallacy"" that tricks both gamblers and investors into believing they cant lose. Because these incursions are fast-moving funny and short they dont slow down the films pace; if anything The Big Shorts 130-minute running time careens by eased along by bouncy pop-cultural montages that trace the nations trajectory from the Reagan years to 2008--from Thatcher to Greenspan to Bernanke yes but also from Cyndi Lauper to Cartman to Ali G. The cronyism deception and systemic malfeasance that led up to the crisis of 2008 have been seen on screen in recent years in the form of tense workplace dramas (Margin Call 99 Homes) grim documentaries (Inside Job) and old-fashioned gangster pictures set in the world of high finance (The Wolf of Wall Street). But McKays saucy innovative comedy accomplishes something no other movie about that time has yet tried. It plays the whole absurd shell game for laughs even as it acknowledges that the last and bitterest laugh is on the rest of us. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 11 2015 Save for later Saved The Big Short stars Brad Pitt (l.). Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""The Big Short"" is fast-paced and entertaining and given that its about the home loan mortgage crisis that led to the 2008 financial collapse I found it surprisingly easy to follow. But as much as I enjoyed parts of this film I was bothered as I was to a much greater extent in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" by the high-style amorality on display - or to be more precise by the films kid-glove attitude toward that amorality.Directed and co-written by Adam McKay and based on Michael Lewiss nonfiction bestseller ""The Big Short"" is about a band of disparate investors who anticipating the housing bubble and ready to stick it to the big banks profit from the crash. They are played by among others Steve Carell Ryan Gosling and Christian Bale the mastermind of the scheme who seems more like a stoned surfer dude than a fat cat and who has one glass eye (the warmer one?). Brad Pitt also turns up as a refugee from the Wall Street wars who has decamped with his millions to Colorado. For some reason I cant fathom all of these actors are wearing unsightly hairpieces. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Anticipating the audiences confusions about investment lingo McKay periodically features celebrities such as Selena Gomez purringly decodingthe arcana for us and speaking directly into the camera. Its a cute ploy that wears thin fast. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The actors play their roles to the hilt but in the end the role of these investors in extenuating the crisis they took advantage of is played down as is the disastrous life consequences of all those who were severely hit by it. This wouldnt be the first time that a movie aimed at championing ""good"" guys ended up more temperamentally in tune with the bad guys.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size David Sims Dec 11 2015 Culture Adam McKay is angry and righteously so. The director of The Big Short a rollicking adaptation of Michael Lewiss non-fiction examination of the financial crisis has taken that books disparate threads and thrown them together onscreen and the messiness feels almost justified. Just 10 years ago a market catastrophe brewed and was largely ignored because there were so many moving pieces to put together. McKay seeks to find order but at the same time hes taking cynical delight in the chaos. Hes created a film that is fun to watch but based on themes that are terrifying to consider.Related Story Margin Call A Financial-Crisis Film Thats on the Money Lewiss book covered Wall Streets astute few who foresaw the 2008 recession and ""shorted"" or bet against it making billions off of the countrys economic ruin. McKay tells those same stories and yet at times it feels like The Big Short cant decide if its protagonists are heroes or villains. Here are people who saw through the lies perpetrated at every level of the booming markets in the mid-2000s each of them charming renegades in their own ways but in profiting off of it they were really just symptoms of a larger problem. McKay shoots every phone call and boardroom meeting so kinetically and lumps in wild dashes of humor but by the end of the film he wants the audience holding their heads in their hands with dismay. It mostly works.Our heroes such as they are include Michael Burry (Christian Bale) an anti-social savant who nearly drives his hedge fund into bankruptcy by making a billion-dollar bet that the housing market will collapse; Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) a slimy trader whos been ostracized for telling his colleagues the sky is falling; Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a retired trader and paranoiac convinced of Wall Streets underlying corruption; and Mark Baum (Steve Carell) a phlegmatic money manager whos the closest thing the film has to a hero. Each of them independently identify the ticking time-bomb of subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations ignored by Wall Streets rating agencies; only Baum seems the least bit angry about what their coming collapse implies.If the very phrase ""collateralized debt obligations"" sends you to Wikipedia McKay and co-writer Charles Randolph have a solution for that--The Big Short does its best to parcel out information about each element of the crisis as plainly as possible even enlisting surprise celebrity cameos to break the fourth wall and talk straight to the audience about credit-default swaps and the like. This is part of the freewheeling charm that made McKay such an exciting voice in comic filmmaking over the last 10 years--hes collaborated with Will Ferrell on films like Anchorman Talladega Nights Step Brothers and The Other Guys all of which contained similar mad flourishes.But it often feels like McKay is working his hardest to spice up a film that mostly consists of phone conversations. His camera zooms wildly into characters faces slowing down and blurring as if succumbing to a fit of rage turning even the most basic exchanges of dialogue into action scenes. His passion for the material and fury at the system hes portraying is palpable but The Big Short is at its best when it slows down for a second. A sequence where Baum and his team exploring the stability of the sub-prime market visit an almost entirely vacated tract of new homes in Miami is weighted with a compassion that most other scenes lack. Thats necessary--you dont want the film to have too much compassion for its blood-sucking ensemble--but the wild lurches in tone can be exhausting.Some of the cast are sleepwalking clearly more interested in the themes being discussed than the roles themselves. Pitt in a smaller role mostly mumbles and broods; Bale does a lot with a role that consists of his character sitting alone in an office listening to death metal and ignoring his emails. Gosling is smarmily funny somehow simultaneously magnetic and repulsive; after years wandering the halls of mediocre art cinema its wonderful to see him cut loose again. Carell is one-note playing the kind of millionaire who feels he has free range to express his fury and disgust to anyone he interacts with but as a surrogate for McKay and the audience hes a vital presence and the only character in the film who has a real emotional arc.There are moments in The Big Short which feel almost absurdly on the nose. In one scene Melissa Leo pops up as a representative of the ratings agencies which continued to slap sub-prime mortgages with triple-A credit ratings even as the market was openly festering. In case you dont get how short-sighted she is McKay has her wearing wraparound dark glasses recovering from some kind of eye surgery literally squinting into the dark as shes confronted with a catastrophe her organization helped create. Its unbelievable--but thats McKays point. In almost every scene you can feel the director gesturing to the audience asking ""Can you believe this happened?"" With every scene hes delighted and horrified to tell you it absolutely did.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading carianoff/flickr Why Some People Respond to Stress by Falling Asleep Elijah Wolfson Fight or flight or sleep Last month my wife and I found ourselves in a disagreement about whether or not our apartment was clean enough for guests--the type of medium-sized disagreement that likely plagues all close relationships. In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

But these are not the wolves of Wall Street. More like the weasels. Because ""The Big Short"" is a picture about the subprime meltdown told from the point of view of the little guys - well comparatively - who figured out early what was going on at the big banks. And saw a way to cash in. Christian Bale is an oddball investor out in Silicon Valley. Steve Carell is a rage-machine in New York. Brad Pitt is a groovy granola capitalist retired to Colorado. Ryan Gosling is in the belly of the beast a shiny suit at one of the financial institutions. But one by one - with Bale leading the way - they figure out that most of these mortgage-backed securities arent AAA investments but class-A junk. And so they short them - betting on them to fail. That way if we lose - if Wall Street and the housing market and everything else goes belly up - they win big. Can you see why this is a problematic subject for a movie? Theres no doubt that director Adam McKay - the long-time Will Ferrell collaborator - feels strongly about the financial meltdown. (He even used the closing credits of the comedy ""The Other Guys"" to rail against CEO compensation.) Hes been sneaking smart anti-establishment messages into big dumb Will Ferrell movies for a long time. But is this the way to do a serious movie about the financial meltdown? By making heroes out of the guys who made money off it? Sure they did it by beating the big banks at their own game and good for them but they werent exactly whistleblowers and they sure werent doing it for us. Robbing from the rich is one thing but you then actually have to give it to the poor to qualify as Robin Hood. Thats why its hard to muster much interest in these characters even though McKay has brought in big stars to play them. Pitt is the most interesting as the off-the-grid titan who actually has a shred of conscience but Carell (outfitted with either a bad dye job an awful wig or both) is wearying Bale overdoes the twitchy genius bit and Gosling is a slimeball. Of course he knows hes a slimeball - he warns us about that early on. But with so many characters on screen and almost all of them annoying theres no one to focus on. Even the good guys arent really good guys - they just want to make some money off the really bad guys before the whole system comes crashing down. And who can root for that? McKay well aware he has a story thats both important to tell and incredibly dull does work very hard to keep it exciting. Celebrities pop up to help explain (not very well) various financial terms and the editing throughout is quick and flashy interrupted by music videos newsreel clips and almost subliminally fast cuts. Its interesting until it isnt. Because a good half-hour before the film ends all the dazzle in the world cant quite distract you from the fact that this is a movie about mostly unpleasant people shouting numbers at each other and talking in incomprehensible jargon. Worst of all -- unlike Leonardo DiCaprios ""Wolf"" - none of them is having any fun. If youre going to make a film about greed-is-great antiheroes at least make them entertaining. Give us some reason to watch them. All credit to McKay for making a movie about a crucial moment in our history but it all still remains a little dull and slightly impenetrable. I went in fully prepared for outrage but after an hour of shorts and bonds and rates and derivatives my eyes glazed over. Which of course is what the Wall Street folks count on. And how they keep doing what theyre doing. Ratings note The film contains strong language. The Big Short (R) Paramount (130 min.) Directed by Adam McKay. With Christian Bale Brad Pitt Ryan Gosling.

"Review The Big Short somehow makes the 08 housing collapse entertaining - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Big Short somehow makes the 08 housing collapse entertaining The Big Short movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews ""The Big Short"" starring Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Christian Bale and Brad Pitt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan reviews ""The Big Short"" starring Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Christian Bale and Brad Pitt. Video by Jason H. Neubert. Kenneth Turan Making an anarchic absurdist comedy about 2008s housing market collapse and the global financial crisis that followed is as unlikely as the collapse itself. But that catastrophe happened and that very funny movie ""The Big Short"" is here to wonder at and enjoy.Making comedies about serious situations used to be in the days before raunch ruled at the box office a Hollywood tradition. Ernst Lubitsch and his writers made Communism funny in ""Ninotchka"" and writer-director Preston Sturges took on political corruption in ""The Great McGinty"" and poverty and incarceration in ""Sullivans Travels."" SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;Working very much in that tradition director Adam McKay (who co-wrote with Charles Randolph) has taken off from Michael Lewis best-selling book about the men who bet against the hugely successful subprime mortgage bond industry and come up with a funny energetic and self-aware film that manages to entertain without diluting the complications -- or the gravity -- of its subject matter. The gamble on Adam McKay and The Big Short looks like it might pay off Josh Rottenberg If you were drawing up a list of possible directors to take on a film about the 2008 financial meltdown odds are the guy who brought the mustachioed jazz-flute-playing weatherman Ron Burgundy into the world wouldnt immediately spring to mind.

If you were drawing up a list of possible directors to take on a film about the 2008 financial meltdown odds are the guy who brought the mustachioed jazz-flute-playing weatherman Ron Burgundy into the world wouldnt immediately spring to mind. So when Adam McKay first set out to bring Michael... (Josh Rottenberg) McKay is best known for the work he did with Will Ferrell guy-centric comedies like the ""Anchorman"" films and ""Talladega Nights."" And with a cast headed by Christian Bale Steve Carell Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt the profanity-laden humor of macho camaraderie is much in evidence here.Pitt is not just a co-star his Plan B Entertainment production company bought ""The Big Short"" as it did an earlier Lewis book ""Moneyball"" which also celebrated an outlier (in that case a baseball general manager) who questioned conventional wisdom.But getting you to root for as Lewis has said ""people who are betting on the end of the world"" people who made billions while others lost everything is a trickier business so much so that five of this storys six protagonists chose not to use their real names in the script.

The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. has announced its nominees for the 2016 Golden Globe Awards. "" Spotlight "" "" The Revenant "" "" Carol "" "" Mad Max Fury Road "" and "" Room ""received Golden Globe nominations for dramatic film while "" The Martian "" "" The Big Short "" "" Trainwreck "" "" Joy "" and...Read the story ""The Big Short"" has made that happen by emphasizing the eccentric outsider status of these individuals something audiences tend to respond to and by using jazzy narrative techniques like having Wall Street banker Jared Vennett (Gosling) speak directly to the audience. And by the amusing use of a group of celebrity explainers who enlighten in highly unconventional ways. So we see ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" actress Margot Robbie in a bubble bath no less talking to us about mortgage backed securities celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain comparing the making of collateralized debt obligations to turning old fish into fresh fish stew and Selena Gomez joining world class economist Dr. Richard Thaler to talk about his idea of extrapolation bias. Like the rest of the film its both engaging and informative.Before the explainers can get into the act Goslings Vennett lays the groundwork for the story talking about changes in the financial world that turned bankers into people that went to strip clubs instead of country clubs.Despite this veneer of unshakable prosperity there were ""outsiders who saw the giant lie at the heart of the economy"" the fact that packaging mortgages into bonds was much riskier than conventional wisdom imagined.Introduced first is Michael Burry (Bale) a money manager who had suspicions about the contents of those bonds as early as 2005. As an antisocial eccentric someone who dresses surfer casual and listens to heavy metal music when he works Burry (the only protagonist whose real name is used) is right in Bales wheelhouse and even sent the actor his own clothes to wear in the film. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Hedge fund manager Mark Baum (Carell) is Burrys total temperamental opposite a disruptive personality often apoplectic with righteous anger at the wrongs of the world. (As a boy in yeshiva were told he spent his time searching for inconsistencies in the word of God.)Baum hears about Vennetts suspicions about the housing market and after a wacky presentation by the banker gets on the skepticism bandwagon. But not before his team of wary analysts (Rafe Spall Hamish Linklater Jeremy Strong) go on the ground in Florida to determine just how bad the mortgage situation is.The last group ""The Big Short"" follows is a pair of up and coming twentysomething money managers Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (John Magaro) who also get a whiff of the problem and are mentored by lone wolf Ben Rickert (an amusing Pitt) a conspiracy theorist with doomsday on his mind.To this films credit even though it places audiences on the side of its protagonists it doesnt let us forget that there were consequences to what Wall Street did that millions of Americans suffered because of the actions of a few.But even as it is emphasizing the fraudulent nature of things ""The Big Short"" never neglects to be entertaining with Barry Ackroyds cinematography and Hank Corwins editing really moving things along. The film packs in so much information and comedy it would be fun to see it twice not just to take in what it has to tell us but also to laugh all over again.------------The Big ShortMPAA rating R for pervasive language and some sexuality/nudityRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesPlaying In general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on December 11 2015 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""08 housing collapse goes down easy - `The Big Shorts stellar cast finds a way to entertain amid true financial ruin. - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Reviews Movies Entertainment Brad Pitt Ryan Gosling Christian Bale Steve Carell Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-big-short-review-20151211-column.html,200,thebigshort22,thebigshort,latimes

Photo Jaap Buitendijk/(c)Paramount/ Courtesy Everett Collection MOVIE REVIEW The Big Short Running time 130 minutes. Rated R (profanity nudity sexuality). Early in ""The Big Short"" when someone pauses to tell the audience what a ""short"" is you know the movie is confused about who its talking to. Did Darth Vader ever have to stop to explain what a ""star"" or a ""war"" was? Things get more tangled as the movie goes on Based on Michael Lewis rightly acclaimed book about the traders who foresaw a collapse in mortgages that would lead to a bank crisis and a nationwide financial panic in 2008 the big-screen version is a film without an audience. As a polysyllabic spree of technical verbiage (""collateralized debt obligations"" ""credit default swaps"") its far too dry for the ""Talladega Nights"" crowd to name one of the many silly Will Ferrell comedies directed by Adam McKay this films co-writer and director. But its self-consciously goofy interludes (Margot Robbie Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain all playing themselves make guest shots to explain the crisis using juvenile comic metaphors) render the film unbearably puerile to those who actually know or care about how Wall Street works. You might as well reduce Einstein to finger puppets. The main purpose of the film seems to be to encourage the actors to go bonkers playing up the eccentricities of their unfortunately coifed characters. Christian Bale plays Michael Burry a mildly autistic one-eyed fund manager in California who plowed through the data to prove that many bonds consisting of packages of bad mortgages were doomed; Steve Carell is an arrogant anger-management case Mark Baum (based on Steve Eisman) who bet against the same kinds of bonds in New York. Ryan Gosling as a fictional character explains directly to the audience what the others are doing and Brad Pitt is a retired paranoiac and elder statesman of finance who helps provide a crucial connection for a pair of young traders working on their own bet against the mortgage-backed bonds. McKays choices keep clashing into one another He badly wants the film to be another ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" but having directed the ""Anchorman"" movies and being a political activist he is equally keen to be taken seriously. So instead of being charming rogues the principal characters strike a hurt and sorrowful tone as they rake in the millions a choice that strips the film of any cheap vicarious thrills and makes the supposed comic lark about as fun as sleet. McKay also shoots much of it like a fake documentary with handheld cameras and natural lighting. The papers on desks in the background are the exact kinds of prospectuses and sheafs of data that would have been on the characters desks in 2008. So why use such maximum artifice as having actors repeatedly break the fourth wall in one case to confess that the scene hes playing is completely made up? Why cut away to nude blondes in bubble baths (Robbie) or perky starlets in casinos (Gomez) to explain finance? At the end of it all comes McKays big angry harrumph about the meaning of the crisis -- a sign of failed frustrated satire. If you can make your message clear through comedy theres no need to say ""Heres my moral."" A funnyman cant afford to get caught wagging his finger.

Courtesy of Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Christian Bale as Michael Burry in a scene from The Big Short. Courtesy of Paramount Pictures The two best American movies of the year so far Spotlight and The Big Short are both docudramas yet are entirely different in tone. Where the former is sober and pitch-perfect the latter is garish overreaching and farcical. All of which is justified by the real-life burlesque act thats its subject Wall Streets 2008 implosion. The Big Short is derived from Michael Lewis 2010 book about a handful of investors who discerned the vulnerability of the market -- make that alleged market -- in securities based on home mortgages. Director and co-writer Adam McKay has lightly fictionalized the tale and changed most of the names. But even the maker of Anchorman and Talladega Nights couldnt conceive of anything loonier than Lewis real-life narrative. ""Securities based on home mortgages"" may sound dull and Wall Streets terms of art -- ""credit default swaps"" ""synthetic collateralized debt obligations"" -- were designed to be opaque. So McKay uses every possible trick to provide cinematic impact and sparkle. The movie employs celebrity cameos direct address to the viewer and occasional reminders that the improbable events on screen really happened. Our host and on-screen narrator is Deutsche Bank salesman Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling with slicked hair and attitude). Hes a weasel but also a hero because hes out to expose systemic fraud. And make lots of money of course. The central characters are Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who runs a hedge fund from California and Mark Baum (Steve Carell) who does much the same thing in midtown Manhattan. Burrys an outsider and Baum nominally an insider but both share a disconcerting tendency to tell the truth. The difference is that Baum cant resist confronting liars and fools to their faces while the reclusive Burry prefers e-mail. Bale and Carell could hardly be better suited to their roles as men who are respectively chilly and anxious. Operating without knowledge of each other Burry and Baum decide to short -- bet against -- the people who insisted subprime mortgages couldnt lose much of their value. That this was a big short is demonstrated by the fact that the global economy has yet to entirely recover from the 2008 takedown. Also on Burry and Baums side of the bet are two young dabblers (John Magaro and Finn Wittrock) who initially cant even get in the door of the Wall Street casino. They turn for help to a former financier (Brad Pitt one of the movies producers) whos so disgruntled by his onetime profession that hes preparing for nothing less than the collapse of civilization. Theres a lot going on here and The Big Short might be best appreciated by people whove already read the book. Thats not because the film doesnt do a good job of explaining what happened. It actually does although viewers will have to pay closer attention than they would to the average Will Ferrell flick. Whats missing is a strong sense of the major players their motivations and their mixed feelings about what theyre doing. Lewis portraits of Burry (thats the guys real name) and Baum (thats not) are more nuanced and thus more sympathetic. Since hes fictionalizing McKay gets to flesh out or actually invent some minor characters. Two of the more memorable are the callow mortgage brokers who take Baum and his associates on a tour of Floridas about-to-collapse housing boom. These guys who may be stupid to know how corrupt they are seem kind of familiar. They could have stepped out of Alex Gibneys Enron The Smartest Guys in the Room. That documentary was released in 2005 about a month before Michael Burry made his first bet against mortgage-backed securities.

Photo Credit Paramount / Regency / Jaap Buitendijk advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The true story of several financial outsiders who bet big on the 2008 mortgage crisis.CAST Steve Carell Ryan Gosling Brad Pitt Christian BaleRATED R (language adult themes)LENGTH 210BOTTOM LINE A muddled comedy-drama though one with a commendable sense of outrage. If you saw Adam McKays enjoyably goofy cop-comedy ""The Other Guys"" (2010) you may remember its unusual closing credits which rolled against an animated graphic explaining the recent financial crisis. Complete with bar graphs and pie charts the whole presentation had nothing to do with the movie but it was clever crystal clear and full of outrage. The same cant quite be said for ""The Big Short"" essentially McKays feature-length version of that short sequence. Based on the nonfiction book by Michael Lewis ""The Big Short"" follows several visionary financiers who glimpsed a way to profit from Americas impending economic collapse. Are these the heroes of the story you ask? Thats just one problem in this well-intentioned but muddled comedy-drama. advertisement | advertise on newsday ""The Big Short"" centers on an entertainingly motley crew (mostly fictional versions of real people) played by several excellent actors. Christian Bale is easily the best as Michael Burry a socially maladroit hedge-fund manager who decides to study U.S. mortgages -- thousands of them -- and realizes that theyre largely heading for the toilet. His strategy Place a massive bet against the housing market. If America loses Burry and his investors win big. Others get the same crazy idea including the cocky Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling); two whiz kids (Finn Wittrock and Charlie Geller) and their eccentric guru Ben Rickert (a deadpan Brad Pitt); and high-strung Mark Baum (a very good Steve Carell) who considers himself a righteous thorn in the banking industrys side. With energetic pacing and zippy dialogue ""The Big Short"" (written by McKay and Charles Randolph) is often entertaining -- a screwball comedy with an angry streak. If only the film could sustain that tone. Among the sharp satire is a compelling but misplaced sequence in which Baum sees firsthand the eerily empty suburbs of Florida. McKay further disrupts his narrative so that random celebrities (Selena Gomez Anthony Bourdain) can explain complicated concepts to us. Movies2016 Golden Globe nominees As the big banks try to avoid paying the piper ""The Big Short"" asks us to root for our heroes but is that what they are? The banking industry certainly needs independent voices and outliers but in the end these financiers made money on our losses. Thats a difficult pill and ""The Big Short"" doesnt have quite enough finesse to make us swallow it.

"The Big Short a frustrating look at fiscal meltdown - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Big Short review Frustrating look at fiscal meltdown The Big Short Jaap Buitendijk / Paramount Pictures Scene from ""The Big Short."" Scene from ""The Big Short."" (Jaap Buitendijk / Paramount Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune If a film can essentially succeed while also remaining essentially frustrating heres a prime example.Im conflicted beyond the usual definitions of ""conflicted"" regarding director and co-writer Adam McKays ""The Big Short"" a valiant zestily acted adaptation of the Michael Lewis nonfiction bestseller about the financial meltdown of 2008. The national and world economies are still mired in the melted cheese of that crisis a slice of recent history that seems very far away and depressingly present. To tell this story McKay and co-writer Charles Randolph cope with an ungodly mass of dialogue concerning the risks involved with collateralized-debt obligations and mortgage-backed securities. Im an idiot when it comes to finances both my own and the countrys. To an idiot like me ""The Big Short"" comes off as an exasperated blur of a movie packed with information loaded with entertaining actors working hard to dramatize and energize.The film is mad as hell justifiably about this particular chapter of American capitalism. McKay who made his name first as a Chicago improv ace and then started making movies such as ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" does all he can as a comic filmmaker to keep the scripts antiheroes on a boil as they sweat and obsess and contrive to make out like bandits while the nation and the world lose so so much. Not enough has changed in the wake of the crisis. ""The Big Short"" is narrated or hosted by a Deutsche Bank hotshot played by Ryan Gosling. He is one of the movies seers the ones who saw it coming and made hay while the rain clouds gathered. Gosling ushers in the movies main players including San Jose money manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale playing the only key character retaining his real-life name; the others have been fictionalized) and a New York hedge fund manager (Steve Carell excelling in a role based on Steve Eisman). These two wagered that the housing market built on credit default swaps and fairy dust would collapse in due course. They were right. Finn Wittrock and John Magaro play a couple of greenhorn investors who likewise wager against the system with the counsel of their mentor played by Brad Pitt. As in ""12 Years a Slave"" Pitt gets to play the conscience-driven progressive swimming against the tide. The Big Short trailer The Big Short stars Christian Bale Steve Carrell Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt. The Big Short stars Christian Bale Steve Carrell Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt. See more videos The movie is panoramic without being especially trenchant which seems a strange thing to say about any script so justifiably seething. Individual vignettes work and work well When Carells Mark Baum travels with his team to Florida to see how the housing market looks there he finds a sharply etched collection of characters illustrating the larger picture. McKay juices the film visually every chance he gets whether its by putting ""Wolf of Wall Street"" actress Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to deliver a sidebar on derivatives or by jazzing up difficult facts and figures in digital animation on screen.Some of that helps but a lot of it plays like nervous overcompensation. ""The Big Short"" is not an easy watch. McKay knows its not an easy topic. McKay probably wouldve been better off going a little crazier with the movie a little further away from the book and deeper into the realm of pitch-black comic satire. Think ""In the Loop"" from 2009. That film however failed to find a big audience. With its star wattage and McKays instincts ""The Big Short"" might get by. The Revenant review Leonardo DiCaprios out for vengeance in Inarritu epic Michael Phillips The gorgeously brutal first hour of ""The Revenant"" marks the peak of director Alejandro G. Inarritus glittering if not quite golden career. For a while his new movies really something. Then as Leonardo DiCaprio crawls across miles and miles of mighty pretty scenery filmed in Canada Montana... The gorgeously brutal first hour of ""The Revenant"" marks the peak of director Alejandro G. Inarritus glittering if not quite golden career. For a while his new movies really something. Then as Leonardo DiCaprio crawls across miles and miles of mighty pretty scenery filmed in Canada Montana... (Michael Phillips) Carell fares best. The role of Baum allows the actor latitude to play the stakes for real while also affording him the chance to brow-beat his competition out of a cab on a Manhattan street. Had the script tilted more toward Baum away from Bales Burry wed have a very different and I suspect a more fully activated picture. This ones diverting which isnt the same as revealing.

The Big Short Capitalism takes a comic wallop from a cast of A-listers Steve Carell second from left and Ryan Gosling in The Big Short. By Peter Travers December 10 2015 More News Brad Pitt The Rolling Stone Interview Adam McKay What Its Like to Write for SNL Taibbi Here Comes the Next Big Bank Bailout All Stories >> It sounds like a horror show a doomsday epic about the 2008 financial crisis and the Wall Street wolves who got rich off it. Gone were the homes jobs and savings of average Joes. But wait. As directed and written by Adam McKay - the dude behind Anchorman and other giddy hits with Will Ferrell his partner on the website Funny or Die - The Big Short is hunting bigger game. Id call it a Restoration comedy for right the fuck now a farce fueled by rage against the machine that relentlessly kills ethics and a hell of a hilarious time at the movies if youre up for laughs that stick in your throat. More News Brad Pitt The Rolling Stone Interview Adam McKay What Its Like to Write for SNL Taibbi Here Comes the Next Big Bank Bailout All Stories >> Related Big Short How Anchorman Director Took on Wall Street Adam McKay on adapting Michael Lewis bestseller on subprime-mortgage crisis ""We actually need this"" Based on the nonfiction bestseller by Michael Lewis The Big Short is brilliantly constructed by McKay to hit where it hurts. A terrific Christian Bale pulls you right in as Michael Burry an eccentric neurologist-turned-money-manager who pads around barefoot in his San Jose office fiddling with his glass eye and banging drums. Its Burry who figures out that those subprime home loans the banks hand out to bad credit risks are a disaster in the making. Wall Street fat cats dismiss Burry as a crank. But not Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) a Deutsche Bank dealmaker who relishes Burrys idea to bet against the banks by shorting home loans that are bound to default. Gosling a virtuoso of verbal sleaze talks directly to the camera and hes volcanically fierce and funny. Its Vennett who intensifies the big short by partnering with Mark Baum (Steve Carell) a hedge-fund manager who runs FrontPoint a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley. Baum is a hardass. But he knows a good deal when it gets a thumbs-up from his trio of number crunchers (Rafe Spall Hamish Linklater and Jeremy Strong). Baum is also the only character in the film with a working conscience. Carell is just tremendous following his Oscar-nominated turn in Foxcatcher with a performance of comic cunning and shocking gravity. Likewise Brad Pitt finds the disgust in Ben Rickert a banker whos paying for his sins by helping the environment - that is until he uses two young money managers (Finn Wittrock and John Magaro) to bite the hand that fed him. Camera maestro Barry Ackroyd helps McKay keep the plot in a perpetual spin. When it sails over your head - and it will - McKay drops in celeb explainers including Selena Gomez Anthony Bourdain and Margot Robbie. Are you more likely to understand CDOs if a naked Robbie explains them in a bubble bath? Probably not. But whos complaining? McKay dares greatly by couching his anger in a slapstick tragedy that makes us wish we could see every character in it behind bars. Does the risk pay off? Bet on it.

Its like a collaboration between Judd Apatow and Bertolt Brecht or just a recognition that theatrical devices that used to seem confrontational or postmodern have now been completely mainstreamed. At one point Ryan Gosling playing a contrarian Wall Street hotshot named Jared Vennett who correctly bets that the mortgage market would collapse in 2008 turns to the camera amid a heated conversation to observe that of course we dont understand the complex financial instruments hes talking about. Thats because were not supposed to he says. ""But heres Margot Robbie in a bubble bath to explain it all.""That sounds like bizarre pandering and of course it is. But it works brilliantly because it cuts to the heart of Michael Lewis nonfiction bestseller which McKay and co-writer Charles Randolph have adapted pretty faithfully despite all the gamesmanship. The financial collapse and economic crisis of 2008 was a gigantic con job enabled by politicians from both parties - most of all by the Clinton administration frankly - and perpetrated by an elite caste of predatory criminals who looted the American people (and the people of the world) and got away with it scot-free. Both Lewis and the movie remain agnostic about whether the principal driving force behind the collapse was widespread fraud and corruption or simply widespread stupidity. Both were clearly implicated and in either case unregulated and undisciplined greed - which apostles of the free market consider the ultimate virtue - proved instead to be immensely destructive.Not all of McKays devices work as well as Margot Robbie in that bubble bath doing her best to explain the mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) that made immense fortunes for Wall Street bankers even as a few guys like Vennett or mid-level fund manager Mark Baum (Carell) or loner investment guru Michael Burry (Bale) began to suspect they were junk. Later interpolations involving Anthony Bourdain throwing day-old seafood in the stew pot or Selena Gomez at the blackjack table dont quite pay off. But McKays highly entertaining thrill ride on the economic roller coaster never loses sight of the fact that Lewis central characters are ambiguous figures driven by familiar forces of self-interest not Robin Hood heroes or Bernie Sanders activists.Theres no doubt that the pugnacious anger-fueled Baum and the smooth stylish above-it-all Vennett - both characters are fictionalized composites but their real-life models can be found in Lewis book - yearn to stick it in the eye of The Man and prove they are smarter than anyone else. In a sense they have some shreds of social conscience in that they see the entire financial system as corrupt (either purposefully or through idiocy) and are eager to prove it. But they make a historic deal despite their mutual mistrust investing heavily in a newly invented instrument called a ""credit default swap"" that would pay off if the banks crazy-house of bogus securities collapsed because they stood to make a fortune if they were right. Which they did In the film Baums fund clears 2 billion all by itself from the financial collapse in which at least 6 million Americans lost their jobs 7 million homes were foreclosed and an estimated 16 trillion in household wealth was subtracted from the economy. In the real world there were guys who profited on a similar scale from this catastrophe which was of course many times larger than that if we consider the world economy.McKay is Will Ferrells longtime writing partner and the director of both ""Anchorman"" movies and ""Talladega Nights"" so hes a conspicuously odd choice to dramatize a book that is both a complex morality tale and a work of power-nerd investigative journalism. But if ""The Big Short"" didnt have these layers of absurdist splash and sizzle and didnt have four of the biggest male stars of our era playing deliberately outrageous outsiders and renegades would you be even remotely interested in watching it? With its cartoonish pace larger-than-life characters and detours into farce and agitprop this movie captures the accelerated pace of life in the financial markets and the vast scale of their mendacity far more vividly than a naturalistic drama could. (I liked J.C. Chandors ""Margin Call"" quite a bit for example but its a totally different animal.) You Might Also Like As in ""Moneyball"" Lewis is fascinated by the issue of data - why certain people can read it and understand it and how they use it to gain advantages over others. But in the case of Billy Beane and the Oakland Athletics the marketplace inefficiencies Beane exploited only involved baseball teams spending too much money on bad players not a global economic catastrophe. In the case of ""The Big Short"" we are left to wonder why Bales character Michael Burry - who really exists a Stanford-educated doctor who quit medicine to run a small but exclusive hedge fund from a California office park - was pretty much the only person who actually peered under the hood at the millions of mortgages beneath Wall Streets elaborate Ponzi scheme of indecipherable interlocking debt.What Burry discovered through his number-crunching was not especially difficult to understand and should have been noticed by government regulators ratings agencies and the banks themselves By the mid-2000s mortgage defaults were creeping inexorably upward and in 2007 and 2008 a large proportion of subprime adjustable-rate mortgages which lenders had been handing out to anyone with a pulse would convert to higher rates that borrowers probably could not pay. Billions of dollars of investments that had been sold with supposedly ironclad AA or AAA rating would likely be rendered worthless. In McKays screen version of the story of course we end up rooting for the irascible Mark Baum and the unctuous Jared Vennett because they are Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling and we know theyre right when everyone else is wrong. But one could easily portray those guys as shameless sleazebags Their ""big short"" rested on the premise that you and I and Aunt Tillie had been played for suckers and that the real-estate boom that had apparently ensured the financial future of millions of American families was a collective delusion. It seems clear in context that McKay wants Brad Pitts understated character a onetime Wall Street whiz kid named Ben Rickert who now lives in the Colorado mountains nurturing home-grown organics and conspiracy theories to serve as a moral counterpoint. Rickert serves as the private Yoda to a couple of enterprising kids from his hometown played by Finn Wittrock and John Magaro who land in Manhattan with a few bucks to invest and catch wind of Vennetts illogical but irresistible credit default swap scheme. He repeatedly reminds them that theres no such thing as non-dirty money especially when youre essentially taking side bets on other peoples misery.Pitt helped produce this movie (as he also did with ""Moneyball"") and I appreciate his desire not to hog the spotlight and to play the voice of quiet Dickensian decency. But Rickert simply isnt as compelling as conflicted characters like Vennett or Baum who are driven to do what they do by larger forces they either cant evade or dont try to. I dont think McKay meant to make an anti-capitalist manifesto (or that Lewis meant to write one) but to my taste such is the intriguing effect of ""The Big Short."" The system is much bigger than anyone and overwhelms all notions of individual good or evil. Its internal logic dictated that the bankers should steal from us and wreck the economy while blaming the whole thing on injudicious decisions made by ordinary people and then that we should bail them out and they should go unpunished.

Photo Photo Credit Jaap Buitendijk The Big Short lends dark wit to the big financial crash 1 / 2 Back to Gallery The financial crisis of 2008-09 gets the movie it deserves with ""The Big Short"" which isnt a drama and isnt quite a comedy but more like a bitter farce. The subject has been dealt with in documentaries and in dramas such that weve come to understand the arrogance and crookedness that almost tanked the world economy. What ""The Big Short"" provides is a proper rendering of the colossal and contemptible stupidity that was also a factor. Almost incidentally it gives one of the clearest explanations of the collapse that has been put on film. Go in knowing nothing about credit default swaps and CDOs and you will walk out educated -- and in the most painless and amusing way imaginable. A running joke of the movie is that whenever something arcane has to be explained the movie brings out a glamorous celebrity to do the explaining. It freely acknowledges that it deals in dull material and finds ways to make it enjoyable. The film is directed by Adam McKay a comedy director best known for several movies starring Will Ferrell including ""Anchorman."" For ""The Big Short"" he locates a specific tone that allows for a wide range of information and moods. It is funny and then serious absurd but with consequences featuring characters who are exaggerated but not ridiculous. The movie has the seeming looseness that can come only with control demonstrating the free impulses that filmmakers can indulge only when they know exactly what theyre doing. Now that theyve gone and made it the story of ""The Big Short"" seems tailor-made for the movies. How do you craft a story about a global calamity? How do you make it without creating a total downer full of dejected people in Ireland and Iceland homeowners losing their homes and retired people losing their life savings? Easy Make a movie about the guys who made their fortunes because of the crisis. Theres your built-in happy ending. And to keep it all from being distasteful show that they all deserved to get rich because they were the only ones in the game who werent completely insane. Based on the book by Michael Lewis the film follows a handful of investors and hedge-fund managers who saw the collapse coming from a few years off. In the case of Michael Burry (Christian Bale) he figured it out by actually looking at the thousands of home mortgages that were bundled into Triple-A-rated bonds. He saw that they were filled with balloon mortgages whose monthly payments would triple during 2007 causing defaults guaranteed to turn the bonds into toilet paper. He saw that the banks were lending money to anybody who could sign their name to a mortgage and that the housing market was bound to crater. To see what others cant see -- what everyone else swears isnt there -- requires a certain kind of obstinacy even eccentricity. As Burry a real-life person Bale gives us a socially awkward guy who works by himself in a room full of blasting hard-core punk music. When he goes to Goldman Sachs wanting to buy a product betting against the housing market hes practically laughed out of the boardroom but not before three Goldman executives take his money. ""The Big Short"" is structured so audiences will root for the inevitable -- the near-collapse of the entire world economy. From the standpoint of the lead characters its a wonder it takes so long. Even when reality starts to dawn the market is held up through unjustifiable bond ratings and misguided investor confidence. To watch ""The Big Short"" is to look forward to seeing the smug look wiped from the faces of everyone who caused the crisis -- from the bond salesman peddling junk to the moronic rapacious salesmen roping people into loans they cant ever pay back. At the heart of the film is Steve Carell playing the semifictional character Mark Baum a morally driven hedge-fund manager who becomes a surrogate for the audiences anger. He embodies the films tone as a borderline comic figure who grows in stature and vision. With one eye on the ticking clock as it tracks different sets of people betting on the apocalypse -- Brad Pitt has a nice role as a Wall Street veteran aiding a pair of talented neophytes -- ""The Big Short"" maintains its wit and velocity for its entire 130-minute running time. Its an impressive achievement though in the moment it might seem like something else -- simply the most relentlessly entertaining film of the last few months.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet At first glance Adam McKays career as a movie director may look like the most single-minded one this side of Dennis Dugan His first five features were all collaborations with his Saturday Night Live soulmate Will Ferrell. But within the McKay/Ferrell oeuvre and its clear style there is an equally clear comic range from the demented free-for-alls of Anchorman and Step Brothers to the more focused satire of Talladega Nights and The Other Guys. McKays first non-Ferrell film The Big Short seems to spin off from the latter--specifically from its barrage of angry end-credits stats about the financial crisis which was touched upon in its semi-absurdist cop-spoof plot.The Big Short is also a comedy of sorts but its stocked with A-listers instead of comic ringers Christian Bale Ryan Gosling Brad Pitt and sole McKay rep-company holdover Steve Carell play characters adapted from the Michael Lewis nonfiction book of the same name who have all caught wind that the financial crisis of 2008 is coming and are trying to ""short"" the housing market by betting big on its collapse. Michael Burry (Bale) a doctor turned hedge fund manager notices the bubble first by studying data on mortgage packages and convinces banks to let him set up investments that bank on the probability of bad loans going belly-up.Played by Bale with a receding gummy grin plenty of nervous air-drumming and a difficulty with human small talk (""You have a very nice haircut--did you do it yourself?"") Burrys lack of slick polish makes him easy for some in the financial world to dismiss. One early adopter of his collapse theory (according to Burry more of a certainty) is Mark Baum (Carell) a malcontent who works in finance but appears helplessly unable to avoid saying whats on his mind which includes a festering resentment of the big banks. He teams up with smarmy trader Jared Vennett (Gosling) for their own shorting scheme. The movies heroes such as they are look like con artists in reverse Theyre guys conspiring to rip off the banks simply by observing the banks faulty procedures (and the outright lies of rating agencies) and betting that as Baum explains fraud can only work for so long. As a narrative The Big Short puts up a major risk of anticlimax; a lot of it is explanation of how the housing bubble grew and why it will burst and then waiting around for that to actually happen. (Burry apparently had a sizable lead time on anticipating what finally went down in 2008.) The waiting game involves Baum and his guys researching the claims made by Burry about these bad mortgages which isnt an inherently exciting process but functions as a series of darkly comic citations. Baums insider outrage generates a lot of the movies best lines like this incredulous exchange responding to cocky lenders discussing their bad loans ""Why are they confessing?"" ""Theyre not confessing. Theyre bragging."" Though much of the movie is fast and funny McKay is clearly gunning for a more serious brand of comedy controlling his usual comic anarchy into mere irreverence. He signals his intentions by switching up his filmmaking style. McKays broad comedies are underrated for their pragmatic combination of gag-goosing framing and improv-friendly coverage; The Big Short goes for a docudrama look with handheld and often close-up camera work jumpy focus and some pointless surveillance-style freeze frames. Some of the effort at seriousness feels a little sweaty but it also has its own snappy energy especially when McKay knowingly breaks format Gosling sometimes addresses the camera directly and occasionally the movie cuts away to a series of financial process explanations performed by attention-grabbing celebrities (like ""Margot Robbie in a bubble bath"" as the movie puts it). McKay seems to regard his film as some form of edu-tainment using his big-name cast and guest stars to get across the absurdity and outrage of the 2008 crisis. Moviegoers excited to witness intra-star fireworks on the way to the righteous outrage however may leave disappointed. Of the four main actors only Carell and Gosling share any substantial scenes and even some of those look like they may have been spliced together in post-production (the two actors faces rarely share a frame). Pitt in particular is very much pulling a 12 Years A Slave appearing in an agreeable but unchallenging supporting role to help out a movie coming from his production company. Bale Gosling and Carell though are all well-cast and compelling; in the end McKays edu-tainment tactics work even if the laughs arent as hearty as his broader work with Ferrell. The Big Short pulls off its own oddball gambit grabbing attention through fringe wonkiness rather than a tantalizing glimpse at bro-banker lifestyles.

Come across too flip and youll offend the many who lost their homes and savings. Be too dry and pedantic with the mind-numbing terms and figures necessary to cast light on the fiasco and risk an agonizingly dull mishmash.So its no small feat that Adam McKays ""The Big Short"" handles the dicey topic appropriately and with style toggling from irreverence to seriousness as it takes on an inherently uncinematic subject. Adapted from Berkeley writer Michael Lewis 2010 best-seller of the same name ""The Big Short"" chronicles the true story of how a small band of prophetic moneymen foresaw subprime mortgage loans collapsing long before anyone else then bet the house the whole thing would go belly up. (L-R) Jeremy Strong as Vinnie Daniel Rafe Spall as Danny Moses Hamish Linklater as Porter Collins Steve Carell as Mark Baum Jeffry Griffin as Chris and Ryan Gosling as Jared Vennett in The Big Short. (Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount Pictures) ( Jaap Buitendijk/Paramount Pictur ) With an A-list cast -- led by Christian Bale Steve Carell Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling -- McKay has pulled off one of 2015s most impressive cinematic hat tricks making subprime mortgages and CDOs (collateralized debt obligation) interesting even a little sexy at times. While ""Short"" lacks the naughty bravado of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" Martin Scorseses skinny dip into suit-and-tie avarice its still a feisty rattling good film that likely will make you spitting mad.McKay the director of the cult hit ""Anchorman"" and his screenwriting partner Charles Randolph manage to keep our attention as they reveal how a batch of quirky financial whizzes including one brainy hedge fund manager from San Jose foresaw the looming mortgage crisis and hatched plans to save investors bacon while carving out some ham for themselves.Advertisement McKays hyperactive film works thanks to its focused purpose. Its presented in a go-for-broke jangly style thats especially apparent whenever ""The Big Short"" needs to break down all those mumbo-jumbo terms. Instead of enlisting a boring chap with a pointer stick or Michael Moore in jeans and a baseball cap we get explanations from a sultry Margot Robbie sipping sparkling wine in a bubble bath Anthony Bourdain in the kitchen and Selena Gomez betting in Vegas. These bold strokes are effective clearing the acronym-cluttered haze while surrendering to our celeb-obsessed culture.That outrageousness and the films wrath over what went down and out on Wall Street makes for one lively interpretation of Lewis respected book.Christian Bale is a standout as the brilliant and quirky Michael Burry founder of Scion Capital in San Jose. The drum-playing heavy-metal-loving renegade sees disaster on the horizon and obsessively details a plan to benefit his investors through credit default swaps. Not everyone believes the town crier but the confident Burry sticks to his prediction. Bale is a marvel tapping into Burrys intelligence and committed resolve with steely-eyed intensity as doubters queue up. Its a great role for a great actor.Some other main characters in the film are fascinating and based on real-life people. One is Wall Street hotshot Jared Vennett (Gosling) who sniffs out whats happening and persuades the smart short-fused Mark Baum (Carell again showing his range) and his Wall Street team at FrontPoint a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley to join in on making some money off the deal.Meanwhile in the one films best sections two young eager market managers -- Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock of ""American Horror Story"" edging closer to star status) and Charlie Geller (John Magaro) both of whom work out of their garage get in on the action with input from shrewd former banker Ben Rickert (Pitt having a devilishly good time). Pitt who also produced the film and was in the film version of Lewis ""Moneyball"" does not have much screen time. But hes hilarious as a doomsayer whos paranoid about what he sees as the planets inevitable environmental collapse and such a germaphobe that he wears a surgical mask on planes.While Gosling seems a good fit for his part he doesnt bring the flair and power he normally wields. That might be because McKay asks him and others to speak directly to the camera an annoying distraction that might work for Kevin Spacey on ""House of Cards"" but not here. Goslings performance needs to be as slick as the movies.""The Big Short"" joins and compares favorably to other laud-worthy films about the tanking of the economy or the insane housing market including the exceptional ""Margin Call"" the anger-inducing documentary ""Inside Job"" and this years indie gem ""99 Homes.""

Theyre not exactly the Fellowship of the Ring One guy the real-life Dr. Michael Burry (Christian Bale embracing a near-Aspergian intensity) blares heavy metal out of his office and analyzes the paperwork of thousands of failing home loans. Another one our narrator Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling on fire) yells his colleagues out of the executive washroom to unleash torrents of cell-phone assholery. A third the investment consultant Mark Baum (Steve Carell) steals cabs from more patient New Yorkers hustling his way to high-pressure meetings where hell whine out his fury. And yet in the subversive riotous The Big Short these are our heroes (of a sort)--the few the brave the vicious who somehow predicted the 2008 housing collapse years in advance. Theyre an extremely unpleasant bunch to build a movie around. Even worse as chronicled in Michael Lewiss deft 2010 best-seller (on which the script is based) they all made a killing while billions in pensions and savings went up in smoke. Still its impossible not to be swept up in their Cassandra-in-the-wilderness craziness because we know theyre right. Almost halfheartedly The Big Short reminds us--via a bearded Brad Pitt as an eco-conscious trader--that millions of lives will be ruined. Mostly though the movies a sick thrill a toast to the douche bags. Director Adam McKay has up to now made things like Step Brothersand Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Now isnt the time to demean those films--theyre exquisite tantrums of unchecked aggression and in a way a perfect resume for The Big Short. McKay more than any director whos taken on this subject to date sees the banking crisis as a shriek of ego which it was. He brings on the smirking agents who sold multiple homes to strippers. Then he brings on the strippers and the crocodile that now lives in the abandoned swimming pool. McKays zaniness has a precedent Like Stanley Kubricks Dr. Strangelove The Big Short is a gleeful tumble toward the apocalypse except in this case it actually happened. Some of the ideas here are fuzzy--how could they not be?--and certain attempts to explain the housing bubble via cheeky cameos by Selena Gomez and Anthony Bourdain (among others) lack the nerve of the sinewy main event. But when a Hollywood comedy turns the crime of the century into a lark you know a huge gamble has been chanced and won.

It took some getting used to but he was more than up to the task. The Big Short is an entertaining if not somewhat informative look at the harsh reality of those who prospered during housing collapse in 2008. Plenty of finance terms and acronyms were introduced throughout the movie as explained by Selena Gomez Margot Robbie playing themselves. Its heavy on satire an will likely make you hate finance bros even more but it was an entertaining movie. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 19 2016NaveenFeaturedFor a reality that took place in 2008 its pretty amazing that only in 2016 is there a film thats able to explain whats seemingly complex in layman terms... And by layman terms I mean that even Selena Gomez is able to explain the structures of a CDO. This dark comedy lifts the lid on a greed fueled world revealing how little accountability or care can be taken when profits are involved. The film finishes on a dark note I wont spoil the ending but its worth a watch.  Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreJan 13 2016Stephen LFeaturedPerhaps this dark comedy bites off more than it can chew trying to make sense of the gigantic clusterk that was the banking collapse of 2008. Its extremely complex and wonky and even the sharks who rigged the house of cards in a morally-bankrupt wager against the entire economy dont really understand how it all worked. Christian Bale is frighteningly focused as the emotionally damaged investor who set the train wreck in motion by betting against the housing mortgage market. Ryan Gosling and Steve Carrell have a ball chewing the scenery as ""masters of the universe."" There are no heroes in this sick tale and I came away more disgusted than outraged. The game continues on the Street after all and none of the bankers went to jail for stealing our money. The Big Short keeps our interest by switching between documentary and traditional film styles with clever cameos of celebs and experts attempting to explain the bizarre new financial instruments that the banks devised to hide their mountains of bad debt. A funny smart well-acted film overall.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreDec 9 2015allysonmtastemakerFeaturedTackling a heavy subject with both satire and straight up absurdity The Big Short is one of the best non-documentary documentaries to hit screens in recent years. The performances are all solid with Ryan Gosling doing his best Leo in Wolf of Wall Street impression (a cameo by Margot Robbie places tongue firmly in cheek) and Steve Carell continuing to solidify his place as one of our best underrated character actors. McKay take a complex issue and makes it easily understandable and palatable for those who never bothered to investigate the complexities. While the horror of the economic crisis may not make viewers laugh out loud it certainly gives a lot to think about with a dose of outrage thrown in for good measure. McKay is stretching his comedic wings with inventive storytelling and here he soars.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Website terms of use Contact us Get listed Advertising Time Out products Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Foursquare Time Out New York Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/us/film/the-big-short,200,thebigshort35,thebigshort,timeout

Based on Michael Lewiss 2010 bestselling book of the same name McKays film operates on a gambit as audacious -- and as ultimately unsuccessful -- as the one that J.C. Chandor risked in Margin Call (2011) which also centers on the economic catastrophe of seven years ago Both ask viewers not only to empathize with but to find heroic obscenely overpaid finance workers. The Big Short goes even further queasily valorizing some of those who profited from the global fiscal freakout. Depicting several of its characters breaking down in tears Chandors project is a white-collar weepie; in contrast McKays bumptious movie awkwardly combines fourth-wall-breaking gimmickry and flaccid indignation with the goofball energy that defines his comedies.One of McKays funny pictures The Other Guys (2010) ended somewhat incongruously with a welter of graphs and charts about CEO billions and bank bailouts and other figures from the ledger of turbo-capitalism. Rather than stoke fury though that data dump had the wan effect of restating the obvious rehashing headlines from the previous two years that had already been dissected and fulminated against in media old and new. Concluding a pleasingly absurd cop comedy one that features a villainous tycoon in a less successful subplot these statistics came off as a hectoring rant by a cranky civics teacher. A similar ersatz too-late populism motors The Big Short -- the movie begins with a quote from Mark Twain -- though the cognitive dissonance it produces is even more dizzying than that generated by The Other Guys closing credits The handful of fact-based finance guys the film tracks who saw that the economy was headed for calamity and made billions of dollars while millions of people lost homes and jobs are held up as conscience-bearers.Film Details The Big Short RatingR GenreDrama Running Time130 min. More Info Trailer Or more precisely as ""outsiders and weirdos [who] saw what no one else could...the giant lie at the heart of the economy"" in the words of oily Wall Street banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) who also serves as the films narrator. Sporting a Chia Pet perm and a vaguely outer-borough-sounding accent Gosling is the first in the cast to directly address the audience a device deployed to diminishing return. The eccentrics extolled in the opening scene include Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a Northern California-based MD and money manager who invents the credit default swap in the mid-Aughts when the films central action kicks off; Mark Baum (Steve Carell also hideously coiffed) an obnoxious hedge fund manager whose backstory involving a dead-by-suicide brother somehow positions him as the films most steadfast moral compass; and Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a onetime trader for Chase turned secular eschatologist who advises two young aspiring operators Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) and Charlie Geller (John Magaro) how to bet against Wall Street.The Big Short queasily valorizes some who profited from the global freakout.These financiers all gather at the American Securitization Forum in Las Vegas save for Burry who is mostly shown in his grim San Jose office scribbling on a whiteboard or wailing on his drum kit in his basement (like the love the physician/rapacious capitalist has for cheap haircuts cargo shorts and going barefoot his enthusiasm for heavy metal is treated as further proof of his ennobling nonconformity). There as Jared tells Mark and his lieutenants they can see ""how dumb this money really is."" The cash may be stupid and stupidly abundant but the financial agreements that make it so are impossibly abstruse ""Who understands this stuff?"" Jamie frets to Charlie.McKay who co-wrote The Big Shorts script with Charles Randolph decides that the best way to explain the deliberately obfuscating terminology is to add another distracting element to the film cutting away to cameoing notables of varying degrees of star wattage who try to simplify the jargon as Anthony Bourdain does with ""collateralized debt obligation."" The glib strategy further clutters a movie already too busy with characters looking right at us to offer asides and with vapid intertitles. (In addition to the Twain adage The Big Short includes this profundity ""Truth is like poetry. And most people fucking hate poetry"" a maxim ""overheard at a Washington D.C. bar."")The first celebrity to offer one of these mini vocab lessons is Margot Robbie who parses ""subprime mortgage"" while soaking in a bubble bath and nursing a flute of Champagne. The Australian actress made her breakthrough performance as the wife of Leonardo DiCaprios Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) a movie whose manic energy McKay clearly tries to emulate. Both savagely funny and utterly depleting Scorseses film about a real-life stock market scammer ascendant in the 1980s remains the most potent in conveying the indecencies of an unfettered economic system and those it rewards largely through the unrelenting depiction of the main characters debauchery. Scorseses Jordan Belfort is granted no redemption. The Big Short meanwhile ends in mid-September 2008 as one of the main players on the terrace of his Park Avenue home wrings his hands over the millions hes about to make from others deprivations. Since I havent read Lewiss book I dont know how distorted this conclusion is. But the stupefying cloyingness of the finale makes me hope that the next economics tome to be adapted even as a lavish musical is Thomas Pikettys Capital in the Twenty-First Century.The Big Short Directed by Adam McKay Paramount Pictures Opens December 11 Directed by Adam McKay.

Photo Paramount Pictures How do you make an exuberant comedy about the financial apocalypse of 2008 that also manages to elucidate -- with documentary-like rigor -- the labyrinthine fraud at the heart of the U.S. economy? Its a challenge that the director Adam McKay leaps to in The Big Short (see our story here) which he adapted (with Charles Randolph) from Michael Lewiss book on the collapse of the subprime-mortgage market. Its a rollicking bad time Related Stories The Big Short Will Make You Furious All Over Again About 2008 The Big Short Author Michael Lewis on Watching His Book on the Big Screen and What Hasnat Changed Since the Crash Brad Pitt on Producing and Starring in The Big Short the Financial Crash and What Keeps Him Up at Night McKay invents his own glorious goofball syntax part business thriller part stand-up comedy with a liberal dash of NPR didacticism -- as in the Peabody-winning ""This American Life"" episode ""The Giant Pool of Money."" He has a master of ceremonies in Ryan Goslings Deutsche Bank slickster Jared Vennett (based on Lewiss portrait of Greg Lippmann) who buttonholes the camera explains how bankers went from ""losers"" to hotshots and introduces characters like the misfit San Jose money manager Michael Burry (Christian Bale) and voluble New York hedge-fund manager Mark Baum (Steve Carell) both of whom bet against a booming housing market built on bad loans. Vennett stops the show for ""explainer"" sidebars that are the movies glory celebrities who spell out whats meant by such concepts as ""mortgage-backed securities"" ""collateralized-debt obligations"" (CDOs) and ""extrapolation bias."" Its important to follow along The more you can cram into your mind the more your mind will be blown by the titanic scope of the greed and illogic. The films various heroes ignore conventional wisdom and risk everything for what they believe and we root for them We love to identify with mavericks even (maybe especially) if in real life we follow the herd. But in this case theres a brilliant nasty paradox at work. When we root for each man to be proved right and make a killing on cascading defaults were actually rooting for global economic collapse and the loss of our own money. We go Yes They did it Theyre rich And then Oh. Shit. Its both a great narrative strategy -- Why would we want to identify with us the patsies? -- and a window like no other into How Things Work in the infernal machine that is 21st-century capitalism. To be fair these men didnt create said infernal machine; they only recognized and profited from it. Bales Burry (the only real name among the films protagonists) is a socially awkward (on the Aspergian end of the spectrum) ex-neurologist who bops around his office-playroom waving a pair of drumsticks. Hes the one who gets it first who flies to New York to buy ""shorts"" from bankers who shoot stunned glances at one another while thinking Sure well take your hundred million heh-heh. Easy money Bale plays him sweet and earnest in his own world of impersonal projections incapable of lying but seemingly untroubled by the morality of his investment Hes only fazed when the market doesnt collapse at the precise instant he knows it should when it continues to be propped up by delusional thinking and he has to hold out against bosses who think hes destroying their firm. Will things go to hell in time to save his investment? Fingers crossed Related Stories Ryan Gosling on The Big Short Finding the Humor in the Financial Meltdown and Why Heall Probably Never Wear a Wig Again Steve Carell on The Big Short Studying Hedge-Funders and His Style Advice to Ryan Gosling Christian Bale on The Big Short and Meeting the Real-Life American Psychos Its Carells Baum (based on Steve Eisman) whos divided against himself in it to win it but aghast at the chicanery and shortsightedness and the prospect of economic Armageddon. He still -- as Vennett notes with sadness and derision -- has faith in the system. Baums brother (also in finance) jumped off a skyscraper and he cant shrug off the real-world consequences of what he does. Before making a deal with Vennett Baum leads his team to Florida where for sale signs and idle bulldozers dot suburban neighborhoods with their empty McMansions. What shocks him even more is the joshing nihilistic materialism of the young men who collect fat commissions on loans that they know will never be paid back. ""Theyre not confessing"" says one of Baums assistants. ""Theyre bragging."" Even more appalling is the sequence in which Baum and Vennett travel to Vegas to get a close-up look at the industry packaging the loans. A scene in which Baum quizzes a smug CDO manager (clearly based on Wing Chau whose libel suit against Lewis was dismissed) ends with one of the few applause lines. Baum hisses ""Short everything this guy has touched"" Carells Baum is capable of sitting still and focusing for short amounts of time but not of keeping his thoughts to himself. He always looks as if he is itchy in his skin and smelling bad things. Its a wonderful performance--peerlessly antsy. But the whole cast is terrific. Gosling sends up his own ingenuous good looks and he has a funny mocking rapport with Jeremy Strong who radiates hostility as one of Baums partners. Finn Wittrock and John Magaro are the films other protagonists a pair of fledgling Colorado investors who get wind of the potential windfall and turn for advice to their old mentor Ben Rickert -- Brad Pitt with a beard in his intellectual Robert Redford-esque persona. Pitt (who also brought Lewiss Moneyball to the screen) co-produced The Big Short with Dede Gardner and as in 12 Years a Slave he gets to be the voice of decency reminding his proteges that their fortunes will be made from the loss of investments pensions and houses. He scolds them for dancing. Although McKay is best known for the slapstick Will Ferrell comedies Anchorman and Stepbrothers he has also shown a fair amount of political sass. He directed Ferrell in the barbed Broadway hit Youre Welcome America A Final Night With George W. Bush and he closed the 2010 Ferrell-Mark Wahlberg buddy-cop comedy The Other Guys with a chart of bonuses paid to executives at financial companies taking government bailouts. Reviewing that film I wrote ""Maybe instead of another buddy-cop movie they ought to have made a comedy about an SEC dummy."" This is close Dr. Who vet Karen Gillan flexes her mile-long gams as the blithely unconscientious Securities and Exchange Commission agent with a yen for finance types -- not a subtle character. More fascinatingly weird is Melissa Leo as the blinkered little Standard amp; Poors analyst whos taken aback when Baum calls her out for giving triple-A ratings to triple-Z loans. ""If we dont give [the banks] what they want"" she explains ""they will go to Moodys."" The Big Short ends with some pointed editorializing about the lack of consequences for the fraudsters who cost the country trillions and I was going to complain about the movie turning preachy ... until I remembered having dinner in 2009 or thereabouts with some far-right-wing friends of my parents. The problem they explained was that the government had forced banks to give loans to minorities and immigrants. The problem was too much regulation. These are not the sort of people whod see the director Charles Fergusons Inside Job or any pinko documentary. But maybe theyll see this nutty whooshy comedy (the best film of the year? Possibly ...) and choke on their popcorn. McKays way of spinning this story gets us where we live.A A A A A A This article appears in the November 30 2015 issue of New York Magazine.

By Anthony Lane Adam McKays all-star cast takes on the 2008 financial crisis.   Credit Illustration by Concepcion Studios Easy Chill Combo Bounce and Sleep and not forgetting Lebowski just add ""The Big"" to any of those words and youve got yourself a ready-made film. The latest contender is ""The Big Short"" directed by Adam McKay and in this case the title swaying on the verge of an oxymoron is a perfect fit for the theme. There was nothing small about the disaster that struck the economy in 2008 and as for shortness the movie is peopled from first to last with the morally myopic and the emotionally stunted. Some characters are invented and some are all too real. Youll love them. Meet Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who works for an investment firm named Scion Capital. He has a medical background and prefers to be called Dr. Burry as if to suggest that hes still involved in one of the caring professions. He also possesses a glass eye an ear for heavy metal and a busted internal radar. Socially he makes Steve Jobs look like David Niven. (Bale can be such a chilly actor but here he plays a chilly man whose very gait spells bewilderment and the result is unexpectedly touching.) As early as 2005 Burry has a hunch grounded in laborious research that the housing market famed as a rock of reliability could soon be washed away. He decides to bet against it and word of his gamble spreads. Largely it is greeted with derision but it piques the interest of Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) at Deutsche Bank a kind of lizard with sideburns who in turn persuades Mark Baum (Steve Carell) the head of a rancorous hedge fund to join the game. If you happen to understand credit-default swaps and collateralized debt obligations or C.D.O.s you might well enjoy ""The Big Short."" If you dont understand them however youll have a much better time. The movie is made for you. It trades on the fact that ten years ago no one outside the fortress of finance had the time the will power or the math to follow the fathomless chicanery that was taking place inside. (No wonder it could flourish with such abandon.) McKay and his co-screenwriter Charles Randolph working from a book by Michael Lewis are so alert to this ignorance that every so often they halt the movie as sharply as a dog walker yanking on a leash. We suddenly hear the voice of Vennett say on the subject of Wall Street verbiage ""Does it make you feel bored? Or stupid?"" He has an unusual solution ""Heres Margot Robbie in a bubble bath."" Cut to Robbie--whom many viewers will have last seen in ""The Wolf of Wall Street""--swathed in foam and holding a glass of champagne. Briskly she unravels the problem of subprime mortgages and adds ""Got it? Good. Now fuck off."" What is Robbie doing here? Pretty much what Marshall McLuhan was doing in ""Annie Hall"" when Woody Allen pulled him into the frame. McKay who made the ""Anchorman"" films is not on entirely unfamiliar territory; he stuffed the end credits of ""The Other Guys"" (2010) with animated graphics about Ponzi schemes. From those you could argue the whole of ""The Big Short"" has burst. His method here is to take the choppy skittish and impatient mood of modern comedy and paste it onto the story of a fiasco. The rants are exhilarating; the editing by Hank Corwin is a riot of faces in closeup chats to the camera and neon-bright montages of pop culture; even a trip to Florida made by Baum and his team who want to see the mortgage market in all its dysfunctional glory comes off as a riff of jocund disbelief. Ramin Bahranis ""99 Homes"" released in September took a far less hasty look at the catastrophe in Florida and at the families who felt the brunt. But that film was--no surprise--a downer and audiences stayed away. Robbie is not the sole provider of a cameo. We also get Anthony Bourdain comparing a financial deal to three-day-old fish soup and better still Selena Gomez and a professor of behavioral economics who sit at a blackjack table and demonstrate how a synthetic C.D.O. functions and ergo to what high heaven it stinks. Do such nuggets of education succeed? They do. So is it the solemn purpose of ""The Big Short"" to leave us properly informed? Give me a break. When Frank Capra made ""American Madness"" in 1932 with the Wall Street crash fresh in the public mind he dramatized a run on a bank taking care not to let the outbreak of chaos send the movie into a spin. At every turn we knew where the story stood. McKay by contrast cant get enough of the spinning. The film is nearly as mad as the world that it sets out to expose. That is why with everything at its most hectic McKay tugs at yet another strand of plot reeling in Charlie Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) out-of-towners who trade from their garage. Hearing by chance of the plan to short the housing market and yearning to cash in they call Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) a neighbor with a beard like a hedgerow and a diet to match. He was once a wizard of Wall Street before quitting in disgust and now for reasons that are never clarified he agrees to help. By this stage McKay has got so many characters in play that only one of them Mark Baum is given much of a backdrop; we learn of a private sorrow wrestled over in conversations with his wife (Marisa Tomei). Harrowed though Carell is in these scenes we dont really need them because his comic tenseness has always depended on something--some disgrace or hurt--wadded down within his roles and we latch on to Baum just by hearing him say to his colleagues ""Im happy when Im unhappy."" That desperate confusion lurks at the root of ""The Big Short."" Can you in all honesty enroll in the pursuit of happiness if it makes you wretched and leaves the happiness of others--millions of them perhaps--in ruins? Yes but if you do it in all dishonesty the pursuing is a lot more fun. And heres the kicker no one will put you in jail. McKay spends the final act attempting to whip us into a froth of outrage at the villainy that was perpetrated in the financial crisis and at the well-dressed villains who slipped through the bars of justice. Nice try. By now his movie has long since succumbed to its own brio. So expert are the performers that you wind up rooting for Burry Baum and the others despite yourself knowing full well that they are fuelled by cynicism--by an ardent faith that the system will and must fail. They are little better than the bankers whose downfall they so gleefully engineer. ""The Big Short"" is a feel-good film about doom and it pays the price. It bets on our indignation and loses. Whats the best way to break the fourth wall? Should you throw a quick glance at the viewers drawing them into sly conspiracy or pal up with them in a more sustained act of concord? In truth we need both methods. We need Eddie Murphy in ""Trading Places"" looking up at us just the once when a rich condescender explains what a B.L.T. is; the look means ""Spare me this old white fool."" But we also need Ferris Bueller keeping us up to speed with every twist in his day off and we need Ryan Gosling in ""The Big Short"" fingering his paycheck for forty-seven million dollars and telling us ""I can feel youre judging me. Its palpable."" And so to Samuel L. Jackson resplendent in a three-piece orange suit approaching the camera in the new Spike Lee film ""Chi-Raq"" and hailing us as guests. ""Welcome to Chi-Raq land of pain misery and strife"" he declares in the tone of someone offering milk honey and a chance to dance. He is the chorus and the movie is based on Aristophanes ""Lysistrata"" first performed in 411 B.C. in which the title character strives to end the Peloponnesian War by urging the women of Greece to stop having sex with their menfolk. Lee and his fellow-writer Kevin Willmott shift the action to the ganglands of present-day Chicago whose citizens are being slain by the gun in numbers that rival American military casualties abroad. Hence the title. The topic is so grave and the corralling of ancient Greek comedy so audacious that you long for ""Chi-Raq"" to succeed. Sad to report its an awkward affair stringing out its tearful scenes of mourning and going wildly astray with its lurches into farce. When Lysistrata (Teyonah Parris) the queen of the revolt enters the Armory (much as female Athenians stormed the Acropolis in the original play) and humiliates the commander who is left half-naked and shackled to a Confederate cannon you dont know where to look. Still if you can handle a collage of provocation and fury rather than a tale well told the movie has its moments as well as its roster of prophets Angela Bassett as a peace activist John Cusack as an inflammatory preacher and the majestic Jackson bringing bad news like a merry Jeremiah. It isnt just the fourth wall that Lee wants to break. Theres a castle of oppression out there and he wants to bring it down.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

That or 2015-12-07 Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Jaap Buitendijk) A The Big Short Release Date 11/12/2015; Release Date Limited 11/12/2015; Release Date Wide 11/12/2015 Posted December 7 2015 -- 1146 AM EST Up until now the most serious film on Adam McKays resume as a director might well have been Anchorman The Legend of Ron Burgundy. That or Talladega Nights. Honestly its a toss-up. All of which is to say he might have been the least likely candidate in Hollywood to make a brainy bruise-black satire of Americas 2008 mortgage crisis. But made it he has. Like Rahmin Bahranis more sober 99 Homes in September McKays The Big Short attempts to explain how the seemingly rock-solid U.S. housing market went from solid and secure to nosebleed-inducingly worthless overnight. The message of The Big Short is that the doomsday omens were there to see... but no one wanted to see them. Based on Michael Lewis 2010 non-fiction bestseller the film follows a small group of contrarian Cassandras who bet against the housing bubble just as it was about to burst. As our semi-trustworthy slickster narrator Ryan Gosling oozes smarm and smartass charm leading viewers through the ins and outs of a game thats always been rigged against regular hardworking folks. Theres also Christian Bale as a socially awkward speed metal-loving doctor-turned-money manager who was the first skeptic to sniff out the house of cards the market was built on. Then theres Steve Carell as a loud misanthropic hedge fund honcho who bet the farm on bad debt. And finally Finn Wittrock and John Magaro as the small fish swimming against Wall Streets herd-minded sharks. None of these people are very easy to root for especially since they stood to make millions off of the absolute detonation of the American economy. But when you stop and think about it their only real crime was profiting off of a crooked system that was going belly up anyhow. McKays film weaves these outsized characters together with snappy effortlessness. And whenever theyre against-the-grain schemes start to get to the point of becoming too arcane or Byzantine the director playfully breaks the fourth wall to allow the audience to catch up. For example when all of the scripts talk about collateralized-debt obligations gets confusing the film might cut to say Margot Robbie in a bubble bath or Selena Gomez at a blackjack table to help explain things. You cant take the merry prankster out of the man. RELATED 10 Best (And 5 Worst) Movies of 2015 I suppose you could call The Big Short a comedy. Its very very funny. But its also a tragedy. Behind every easy drive-by laugh is a sincere holler of outrage. Deep down McKay couldnt be more serious about his films message which is this Anyone who ever bought into the version of the American Dream that included their own home (with or without a white picket fence out front) was played for a sucker by the banks the regulators and the government who all seemed to interpret capitalism as license to rob people blind. The Big Short has such a wicked rat-a-tat energy that by the time it was over I felt like Id just seen the movie that The Wolf of Wall Street wanted to be. McKay deserves a lot of credit for making it and he also deserves to be taken seriously now as a filmmaker. Because with The Big Short hes graduated from wiseass to wise man.

(Jaap Buitendijk / Paramount Pictures) BY Gersh Kuntzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday December 7 2015 653 AM Title The Big Short Film Info With Steve Carell Christian Bale Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt. A comedy about the tragedy of the 2007 near meltdown of the world economy. Director Adam McKay. (210). R for some language. AMC Lincoln Square AMC Empire 25 Regal Union Square. More locations on Dec. 23. Remember the financial crisis of 2007? Remember how the entire nation was brought to the brink of a new Great Depression by some greedy bankers and the confusing fiscal instruments they wielded? Remember how angry you were when no one went to jail? Remember how all the greedy guys got rich again? The makers of ""The Big Short"" certainly do. Taking Michael Lewis seminal book about the meltdown as source material director Adam McKay channels his own anger into something rarely even attempted by Hollywood let alone pulled off a comedy about a tragedy. Better still its a cogent attempt to make sense of one of the most confusing facets of our modern civilization. The story of Americas near collapse is told through three teams of unhinged stock traders. One is led by Mark Baum (Steve Carell) who is so fueled by anger at Wall Street hucksters that he skulks through the movie like a coiled snake ready to pounce. Another is led by Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a borderline-Aspergers savant who figures out that the crash is coming simply by examining how many sub-prime mortgages are about to go belly-up even though theyre all rated AAA. And the final team features Ben Rickert (Brad Pitt) who got out of the financial because its so disgusting only to be drawn back in when he realizes he can make a buck by betting against the bad guys. The teams never meet but come to the same conclusions about the imminent collapse from different places. Along for the ride is Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) a sleazy hanger-on who figures out how to win whether the economy crashes or soars. A voiceover from Gosling ties it all together -- a deconstruction approach that is reminiscent of ""Goodfellas"" except that this scam was being carried out by Masters of the Universe not mafiosos. McKay (""Anchorman"" ""Talladega Nights"") is far more comfortable with the humor of the situation -- but thats one of the strengths of ""The Big Short."" At several times during the narrative the action stops so that a celebrity -- Margot Robbie in a bubble bath Anthony Bourdain in his kitchen or Selena Gomez at a blackjack table -- can explain an esoteric bit of financial jargon like credit default swaps or collateralized debt obligations. Mark Baum (Steve Carell) confers with Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling) as they figure out how to profit from the coming bust of the housing bubble. (Jaap Buitendijk / Paramount Pictures) Its not only funny but in helping to define obscure terms it may be the greatest legacy of ""The Big Short."" But its not just a much-needed civics lesson Indeed the technique allows McKay to mock our general lack of understanding of Wall Street while simultaneously reminding us how Wall Street profits from that lack of understanding and our blind trust that financial systems are self-regulaing. Bale and Carell offer Oscar-worthy performances in that rarest of Hollywood role the sympathetic villain. Their characters stand to make billions from the financial collapse but the audience can never hate them because they take no delight in being proven correct -- and barely even want to collect their payday. If ""The Big Short"" has any flaw its that at its climax -- when the financial system crashes and the short-traders are proven right -- McKay pulls his punch Were the big banks knowingly corrupt or just so drunk on money that they didnt care to behave any other way? Baum and his cohorts clearly think the fix was in but McKay doesnt necessarily agree. The viewer is left as he pretty much was when the dust settled stripped by the greedy confused about what just happened and wanting someone anyone to end up with striped sunlight. But did anyone in a fancy suit actually do anything criminal? Its just not clear. Besides Baum Burry Vennett and Rickert get their revenge against the system -- but its a dish that leaves them cold.

Daily Edition Login to download The Big Short AFI Fest Review 312 AM PST 11/13/2015 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A one-note comic drama about finance high and low. TWITTER Adam McKays all-star comedy vehicle is about a bunch of Wall Street wiseguys who made a mint out of the financial crisis. The world is divided between many fools and a few sharp crazies in The Big Short a strenuously unfunny comic drama about a handful of foresightful or maybe just lucky Wall Street guys who made a mint by being right about the home loan mortgage crisis that led to the 2008 financial collapse. While there is a certain undeniable fascination in watching the so-called experts go down while a few visionary mavericks escape on self-made lifeboats you can never escape the thought that Paramount probably made this film only because of the success of The Wolf of Wall Street two years ago and then recall how much better made and more entertaining that was than whats onscreen here. A top cast and the prospect of indulging in some deep-dish schadenfreude will prove a commercial draw up to a point but mainstream fans drawn by the big four cast toppers -- Christian Bale Steve Carell Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt -- might not be so amused. Director and co-writer Adam McKay switches gears considerably from his Anchorman and Talladega Nights heyday with a film in which one hundred per cent of the dialog is about finance of which 98.6 percent will go over the heads of the general public. This is as much as admitted by an amusing conceit in which none other than Wolf co-star Margot Robbie is brought in fairly early on to take a bubble bath and drink champagne while jocularly explaining about sub-prime mortgages and other issues of relevance; Selena Gomez picks up the baton for similar purposes later on. Not that this or anything else does much good to clarify the financial shenanigans and buyer blindness that went into the calamity that hit seven years ago. Read more Brad Pitt Wants Justice for Victims of Financial Collapse ""Its Disgusting. It Makes Me Angry"" Based on an esteemed book by Michael Lewis the script by Charles Randolph and McKay focuses on the handful of men in the field -- most of whom seem at least half-bonkers -- who bet against the conventional wisdom by not accepting the shibboleth that just because something hasnt happened before means its never going to happen. In a world of almost constant weirdness perhaps the weirdest sight of all is Scion Capital executive Michael Burry (Bale) he of one glass eye who demonstrates that one eye is better than two in spotting a calamity that awaits some distance down the road. How he holds down this job is less certain however since the man is so ungainly and antisocial that one might be forgiven for imagining him the village idiot. But hes quite sure hes called this one right. Mark Baum (Steve Carell) is one of the rudest men alive as he has an ill-advised habit of bursting into rooms loudly imposing his opinions whether anyones interested or not and generally behaving like a boor. Accused of being unhappy he replies that ""I am happy when Im unhappy."" Read more How Adam McKay Managed to Write and Wrangle Stars for The Big Short (Qamp;A) Ryan Goslings Jared Vennett is arrogantly self-assured in a more conventional manner while Brad Pitts bookish Ben Rickert has already retired to Colorado when called upon to lend his expertise to the maverick view that nothing is too big to fail. With the action mostly set in New York offices and conference rooms McKay serves up one scene after another in which the conventional wisdom of executives at various top-name financial institutions -- some still in business others merged or gone -- is challenged by the outliers whose gloom-and-doom prognostications are dismissed for years as anything from simply cracked to market ""buzz-kill"" to downright heretical. On their own individual scenes are effective enough in semi-farcically portraying the ignorance avoidance and/or downright denial by the practitioners of bad loans. Together however they are wearying in their repetitive nature (the mavericks uniformly prevail over the know-it-all establishment) and depressing given the awareness of how it all turned out. In a manner that splits the difference between the jokey and the objectively serious McKay tries to explain what all the arcane financial terms mean and ultimately comes down very hard on the selfish and larcenous executives who refused to confront the consequences of their practices before it was too late. And well he might. But both the behavior of the characters and the viewer responses sought are so repetitive and unchanging that it all becomes wearisome well before the far overlong feature wraps up. The cast is game to be sure with everyone seeming to take enthusiastic pleasure in disappearing into the roles of societal misfits of one kind or another.

In his potent 2-min. 21-sec. drama The Landlord a wolf in Baby Gap clothing-played by McKays then toddler Pearl terrifying in a ruffled blue pinafore-shakes down a distraught Will Ferrell for back rent she knows he cant pay. Discomfiting as it is The Landlord was just a run-up to The Big Short McKays serrated true-life tragicomedy about four outlier investors who foresee the subprime-mortgage meltdown and cannily set out to short the housing market-only to realize to their horror that the system theyve managed to game is so rotted through that millions of Americans will soon lose their homes and jobs. Christian Bale plays Michael Burry the one-eyed savant who by scrutinizing reams of data first spots hidden cracks in the housing markets foundation. Steve Carell is renegade hedge-funder Mark Baum who takes Burrys research even further uncovering sickening global ramifications. Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt show up as respectively a slick Wall Streeter with untrustworthy hair and a reclusive former banker with a penchant for organic produce and colonics. McKay approaches this adaptation of Michael Lewis book with wit energy and a surprising degree of clarity. But if the movie is a crackerjack entertainment its one with a conscience. McKay invites us to laugh at the meltdowns abundant absurdity but makes sure the bitterness of the joke lingers. Pearl the landlord even surfaces briefly in a greed-is-good montage. In retrospect this tiny tyrant doesnt seem like such a bad egg. We just didnt know how good we had it. This appears in the December 14 2015 issue of TIME.

Based on Michael Lewis nonfiction best-seller this postmortem on the 2008 financial crisis overflows with facts jargon rage cynicism jokes insults and A-list stars. Unless youre a Wall Street trader or a CNBC fanatic youre bound to learn something new about how unregulated capitalism set itself on fire less than a decade ago -- and how the banking industry has retained its tight grip on both the kerosene and the matches. For all the millions of jobs houses and pensions lost though talking about how the economy was set on a path to ruin is one of the surest ways to bore and confuse your audience. Director Adam McKay (""Anchorman 2 The Legend Continues"" ""The Other Guys"" ""Step Brothers"") knows this which is why he practically invents a whole new genre -- lets call it the lecture-comedy -- for his latest film. Also Read Funny or Dies Production Chief on Why Will Ferrell-Adam McKay Project Isnt SNL Billy Eichners Big Move At least half of McKay and Charles Randolphs script is devoted to explaining things like subprime mortgages and synthetic CDOs. The film (wisely) never overestimates viewers attention spans embracing instead a kitchen-sink approach to any technique that might work Ryan Gosling talking to the camera Margot Robbie defining financial terms while taking a bubble bath tumbling Jenga blocks the most obvious visual metaphors to be conceived. A credit-ratings agency employee (Melissa Leo) willfully blind to the tanking housing market wears sunglasses in her office. An SEC regulator (Karen Gillan) looking for a job in the industry shes supposed to be overseeing sleeps with a banker. After requesting so much mental bandwidth in other departments the film does us a favor with these undemanding images. The screenplays Niagara-like cascade of information can be exhausting and impossible to keep up with but its ambitious and innovative format serves both its subject matter and its dramatic core rather well. The one major misstep is in the restless camerawork which bobs and weaves and zooms and zags with nausea-inducing regularity. (This might contribute to the headache.) Also Read Archie Comics Musical Coming to Broadway From Anchorman Director Adam McKay and Funny or Die Taking place between 2005 and 2008 ""The Big Short"" follows a small group of eccentric or up-and-coming investment-banker types -- mostly separate from each other -- who are the only ones to see the meltdown of the housing market coming. Being money men they follow their first instinct to profit off the impending economic apocalypse by shorting or betting against the real-estate sector. Portrayed by Gosling Christian Bale Steve Carell Finn Wittrock John Magaro and Brad Pitt theyre financial heretics under enormous pressure to be right. If their calculations are incorrect for example Bales Michael Burry could wipe out his 300 million company. Playing variations on the smug obsessive genius Gosling Bale and Carell provide the bro-y bluster that fuels the films impatient pacing and combative sense of humor. In contrast are Wittrock and Magaros Jamie Shipley and Charlie Geller self-questioning small-timers who hit the jackpot so to speak when they become the proteges of retired investing virtuoso Ben Rickert (Pitt). Supplying the films ethical center is Carells Mark Baum a rude reedy loudmouth who hates Wall Streets corruption as much as he benefits from it. Most if not all viewers will know going into the movie that this sextet will despite their many setbacks make millions off their short. McKay initially gets us to root for these smartest guys in the room -- which isnt hard to do. The stakes for them are colossal and somehow get even larger when it turns out that the market initially seems too corrupt to reward them for their Cassandra-like insights into the future. But in a sophisticated narrative pivot the film then complicates the moral picture by reminding us that its main characters arent really doing anything more than exploiting other peoples misery. Also Read Will Ferrell and Adam McKay Producing Remake of Manimal Those dudes may bask in the spotlight but ""The Big Short"" is really interested in ordinary citizens whose lives we see in heartbreaking glimpses. The films compassion for everyday Americans -- whom the bankers chose to forget about when devising the various valves and switches that triggered the Great Recession -- along with its energetic determination to entertain enlighten and infuriate make it a laudable surprise. ""The Big Short"" might be too pessimistic to serve as a call to action but it certainly wants us all to at least know how weve been screwed over. And if that requires instruction in what a ""bespoke tranch opportunity"" is McKay really doesnt mind telling you all about it.

Of all the current centurys most cataclysmic world-historical events the 2008 financial crisis is probably among the most poorly understood. Filmmakers looking to rectify this have already approached the story from a number of angles from sober-minded documentary (""Inside Job"") to operatic boiler-room drama (""Margin Call"") but the route taken by ""The Big Short"" is by far the most radical turning a dense economics lecture into a hyper-caffeinated postmodern farce a spinach smoothie skillfully disguised as junk food. Taking style cues from hip-hop videos Funny or Die clips and ""The Office"" Adam McKays film hits its share of sour notes; some important plot points are nearly impossible for laypeople to decipher even with cheeky fourth-wall-obliterating tutorials and the combination of eye-crossing subject matter and nontraditional structure makes it a risky bet at the box office. But theres an unmistakable scathing sense of outrage behind the whole endeavor and its impossible not to admire McKays reckless willingness to do everything short of jumping through flaming hoops on a motorcycle while reading aloud from Keynes if thats what it takes to get people to finally pay attention. Adapted from Michael Lewis bestselling book ""The Big Short Inside the Doomsday Machine"" McKays film traces the roots of the global market collapse through the eyes of those who saw it coming and figured out ways to profit from it. First out of the gate is Michael Burry (Christian Bale) a stock-picking shaman with a glass eye and an utter lack of social graces who crunches numbers while pacing his office barefoot and blaring Mastodon. By actually bothering to go through the thousands of individual mortgages that make up the securities that underwrite so much of the banking industry Burry realizes that a dangerous number of subprime home loans are on the verge of going south and decides to plug more than a billion dollars of his investors money into credit default swaps effectively betting against the housing market. His seemingly insane investments create enough of a stir on Wall Street to attract the attention of alpha-douche banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling who also serves as the films foul-mouthed narrator). Thanks to a fortuitous wrong number Vennett winds up going into the credit-default-swap business with Mark Baum (Steve Carell playing a fictionally named character) a self-hating hedge funder with a centimeter-long fuse. The potential windfall also interests the bumbling small-potatoes investment team of Charles Geller (John Magaro) and Jamie Shipley (Finn Wittrock) who loop in a former banker-gone-New Age (Brad Pitt) to help get them a spot at the grown-ups table. Despite sturdy energetic performances from all the actors mentioned above only Carells Baum manages to register as a genuine empathetic character; not coincidentally hes also the only one to express believable compunctions about getting rich off a looming fiscal catastrophe. Indeed despite its satirical bent ""The Big Short"" often seems a bit too eager to present these men as sympathetic when all they really did was prove to be smarter than the average investor about a downturn that caused so much misery for so many innocent people. Simply balancing this many characters (there are also significant roles for Marisa Tomei Adepero Oduye Hamish Linklater Rafe Spall and Jeremy Strong) would be difficult enough but McKay is also tasked with talking his audience through immensely -- and at times intentionally -- esoteric financial products and procedures. Sometimes he does this through onscreen text and at others hell halt the narrative to have attractive celebrities spell out terms like ""synthetic collateralized debt obligation."" Aware of how quickly viewers can tire of watching terrible men in suits screaming jargon at each other the director also splices in lightning-fast montages of period-appropriate pop culture and sometimes seemingly random imagery to keep up the pace. (Editor Hank Corwin more than earns his paycheck here with the sheer amount of visual information hes managed to process though the film could have done with a more low-key shooting approach than d.p. Barry Ackroyds somewhat exhausting camera movement.) ""The Big Short"" is miles removed from McKays previous films like ""Anchorman"" and ""Talladega Nights"" but a bit of their broadness remains and his attempts at more subtle metaphorical commentary -- an Samp;P analyst (Melissa Leo) with a vision condition a drunken SEC agent (Karen Gillan) throwing herself at anyone with a Goldman Sachs business card -- are way too on-the-nose. As it nears its final act however the film takes an effective turn for the serious with even our cynical investor-heroes surprised to learn just how deep the institutional rot in the countrys financial systems really went. And perhaps McKays hyperreal approach is exactly what this story needs given how far removed from the reality-based community so many of the highest-paid financial gurus were at the time. (More than once the film has to directly address the audience just to stress that yes the scene talking place actually did happen.) In the pics most viciously surreal sequence Baum and company travel to Florida to see firsthand some of the mortgages that are threatening to go belly-up finding cul-de-sacs full of abandoned houses highly motivated McMansion sellers and a pair of meatheaded mortgage consultants who chuckle over writing six-figure home loans for buyers with no income or down payment. Baum steps aside and consults with one of his agents. ""Why are they confessing?"" he asks confused. ""Theyre not"" comes the reply. ""Theyre bragging.""

Michel says June 28 2016 at 534 pm Hopefully (and weve all heard about hoping and crapping in ones hand which get filled first) this movie as well as the book its based on will be compulsory reading/viewing in all the ivory league halls of higher learning. Reply Fred says March 22 2016 at 421 am Reading from Keynes is what caused this mess in the first place. Reply Moon says January 10 2016 at 149 am What a great film. It is bizarre in its execution wonderfully acted and it does not lecture people on morality. Most importantly it doesnt patronise the audience by wrapping the economic crisis into a soppy drama like other films have done to make it accessible to the general public because they think we cannot understand the financial part of the crisis or the banks rating agencies and governments involvement in it. And it does not make the characters sound like heroes at all I have no idea where the reviewer got that from. In fact in more than one time it points out that they were aware of the consequences on the American population they just were surprised about how deeply corrupted the all system was when the crisis broke off. Reply Connie says January 9 2016 at 628 pm I watched in a audience of all retirees. We laughed all the way through and then we left so angry. Reply Sane Jane says January 9 2016 at 350 pm I thought the movie was terrific. I hope word of mouth makes people continue to see it. Reply deborah says January 7 2016 at 948 am The Wall Street Journals review clinched it for me grab my coat and go Now I think ""The Big Short"" is too important a film to miss. From Variety Adam McKays film-version of ""The Big Short"" got a 70 in Fandango (accessed 12/31/2015). That 70 looked out of place among several 90s and a half-dozen or so 100s Fandango posted (one from WSJ). Yet I dont object to Andrew Barkers assessment but something he said still bothers me That ""some important plot points (that) are nearly impossible for laypeople to decipher even with tutorials ... make it a risky bet at the box office."" But I already knew up-front on my way to the movie that I wouldnt really understand that much. Except thats what it was all about in 2008 and as the film said widespread-greed stupidity fraud and opaqueness that kept us all in the dark. Looking back now I wonder if even my own lack of financial-literacy wasnt also fueling the momentum. Soon it would be possible for those so much smarter than I am to bet against (short) the housing-market meaning to bet against-- me holding my mortgage. I assume Variety holds sway (in the entertainment industry) as it has for decades and that reviews generally affect a films distribution and release (re theaters and streaming media). Im only guessing of course but my point is anyone who wants to see ""The Big Short"" (in limited release where I live) should have the chance. Reply Ed says January 6 2016 at 331 pm This is one of the most articulate reviews Ive read about this movie. Indeed Hank Corwin does terrific work and there are far too many wobbly hand held close ups that are frequently out of focus. And for all the tea party guys who want to blame everything on the government step away from the Kool Aid and stop watching Hannity. Reply Fred says March 22 2016 at 424 am The free market tried to fix the banks but the feds put a stop to that. Reply Jay says January 1 2016 at 1159 am Good movie but absolutely zero mention of Fannie and Freddie and the role government played in this crisis. To portray regulators as being asleep at the wheel is disingenuous. They were encouraging banks to lend to people who shouldnt have loans in the first place. Reply deborah says January 7 2016 at 1019 am Hi Jay The film made a reference to Fannie in a visual. It was of a cover of a Fannie Mae GPO publication. I blinked almost missing it too but it was there Reply Tom says December 25 2015 at 945 am This is all Bernie Sanders needs for his election campaign. Horrific that the big banks are bigger and more powerful than in 2008 and are concocting even more risky financial instruments that will benefit only the wealthy before the fraud is revealed. As Carell quotes in the movie. Fraud isalways eventually revealed and fails. And by the way...........this is all true. Massive fraud without prosecution bailed out by taxpayer money. Take that back. The government had to go further in debt to fund the bailout. And to think that Hank Paulson was the Secretary of the Treasury and former CEO of Goldman Sachs a big perpetrator of the convoluted fraudulent schemes. Reply eddie willers says December 11 2015 at 943 am 1% of the one percenters will flock to the theaters. This bomb will make Steve Jobs look like Star Wars. Reply jhoughton1 says December 5 2015 at 839 pm ""all they really did was prove to be smarter than the average investor about a downturn that caused so much misery for so many innocent people."" In fairness they yelled and screamed about the looming bubble the while as they were betting on it. Problem was no one wanted to listen. Reply jhoughton1 says December 5 2015 at 837 pm The reviewer fails to mention ""Too Big To Fail"" an excellent parsing of the events of that dramatic time. Reply Banjoman says November 24 2015 at 130 pm The invocation of Keynes is exceedingly weird... Reply Silvana says November 16 2015 at 1144 am Entertaining. This could win Oscar or Spotlight. The race is between just those two films. Reply Gabriel says November 15 2015 at 1114 am Not going to lie this does look really fucking cool. Reply citney211 (indi15243) says November 14 2015 at 317 pm Another home run for Brad Pitt and Plan B. The man is on a roll. Reply K.D. says November 13 2015 at 609 pm Just saw it..... Its electrifying and its awesome. Huge kudos to McKay whos pulled off a nearly impossibly hard feat. And literally every actor was just dynamite esp Bale Carell amp; Pitt. Reply citney211 (indi15243) says November 14 2015 at 318 pm With this cast and Plan B producing how could this go wrong. Reply Wendy Cooley says November 13 2015 at 240 pm I cant wait to see this. It might open some of the publics eyes to Wall Street and Investment bankers. Reply Adam says November 13 2015 at 604 am Does the film mention the role of Freddie Mac Fannie Mae and the repeal of the Glass-Steagal Act in the 2008 financial crisis? Reply George Khalsa says December 23 2015 at 426 pm In assuming the audience will only pay attention to TV stars in a conversation about financial markets McKay insults the audience. By characterizing the financial services industry and all who work in it as corrupt this movie actually mitigates the criminal guilt of the high level industry and government people who perpetrated a fraud. If everybody is corrupt then who is guilty? Reply jhoughton1 says December 5 2015 at 841 pm It will be interesting to see if the conversation is re-ignited or if people just say ""Get over it that was so eight years ago"" Reply Shawn McDonald says December 7 2015 at 843 am Somehow I doubt the movie mentions Congresswoman Barbara Jordan of TX whose idea it was to give mortgages to people who could not pay for them. Or the Clinton Administration enacting Barbara Jordans ideas. Or the seven times agents of the Bush Administration went to the Banking Subcommittee of Congress and warned them that Freddie and Fannie were overleveraged in bad debt. And the seven times Barney Frank laughed them off. But at least idiot America can finally figure out that it wasnt GWB who invented an obscure mortgage insurance product that ended up being exploited to the temporary ruin of some 401Ks and the lowest workforce participation in history. Zoe says November 13 2015 at 540 am This doesn`t really sound like the Oscar contender some were predicting it would be. Reply LOL says November 13 2015 at 1026 am No. Its more middlebrow star-driven audience-pleaser.Youll like it.
