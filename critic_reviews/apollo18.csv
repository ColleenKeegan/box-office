Launched in 1972 Apollo 17 was NASAs final mission to the moon. So the conceit of ""Apollo 18"" is that authentic raw footage was mysteriously uploaded to lunartruth.org depicting the trials and tribulations of a top-secret subsequent Apollo mission. Landing on the lunar surface two astronauts are immediately vexed by communication difficulties. Something is out there manifested by a lunar rock that seems to move on its own volition. And if a moving rock doesnt terrify you just wait -- theres more On their second day outside the module the astronauts find footprints leading to a Russian LK Proton Lander. Russians on the moon? No But if the Russians beat us to the moon they paid dearly for it as a dead Cosmonaut is found on the deep dark bottom of a crater where the sun has never shone. Without giving too much away our astro-boys soon find themselves in a heap of trouble that makes ""Apollo 13"" look like a walk in the stars. Of course Apollo 13 was a real flight fraught with real problems. ""Apollo 18"" despite its convincingly distressed footage and verite approach is never believable its veneer of authenticity shattered by poorly scripted scenes that leave the audience one step ahead of the action. Actors Warren Christie and Lloyd Owen give it their damnedest in the cramped set but neither is very convincing. Despite the varied angles and jostling hand-held camera Christie and Owen usually wind up looking more like two actors delivering lines than two astronauts fighting for their lives. Cinematographer Jose David Montero delivers convincing high-grain footage befitting the era replete with scratches and dust motes making his new shots blend seamlessly with archival moon footage and digital effects. His use of a strobe as one of the astronauts descends into a pitch black crater is chilling and effective teasing us with whats down there in brief snippets surrounded by terrifying blackness. Kris Finskes sound effects editing a mix of echo-y noises distorted radio waves and unexplained bumps and pings chillingly underscores nearly every scene. It is fine work ladled on a little too thick effectively ratcheting up tension but too weak to maintain it on its own. Movies like this and ""Paranormal Activity"" or the aforementioned ""Blair Witch Project"" draw their power from the overall feeling of veracity. But those movies have the benefit of being set in ordinary environments playing on old fears dwelling in familiar places. ""Apollo 18"" takes place in an out-of-this-world setting that is unrelatable. Movies in this sub-genre usually escalate going from the mundane to the unusual and building to the unthinkable. But ""Apollo 18"" doesnt escalate fast enough or high enough. Of course the real genesis of the new movie isnt found footage uploaded to the internet but rather ""Wanted"" director Timur Bekmambetovs screenplay contest which selected Brian Miller and his ""Apollo 18"" script as its winner. For Miller the experience must have been like something out of a fairytale but in fairytales the moon is made of green cheese. In ""Apollo 18"" it isnt the moon thats cheesy just the movie.

They barely exist as movies. The latest specimen Apollo 18 isnt egregiously inept. It just never lives. Its 80 minutes of dead air. In concept this thing must have leapt off the page ""Get ready for Blair Witch -- on the moon"" A prologue explains that while the Apollo missions supposedly were scrapped after number 17 footage has been leaked that reveals a final covert lunar trip its launch disguised as a payload its catastrophic fate covered up. What follows is a mixture of drecky Cold War sci-fi Alien-like paranoia and new-style faux-documentary montage. Two uninteresting astronauts land on the moon while one uninteresting astronaut orbits it. The two on the moon hear a bump the first night ""What was that?"" And then ""Shit. What was that?"" And then ""How did that rock get there? I bagged and tagged at it."" ""What the hell ... ?"" By this point in The Blair Witch Project Paranormal Activity and Cloverfield youre feeling something for those dull people -- youre there with them in the moment. But in Apollo 18 the attempt at realism -- the spacesuits the fuzziness of the images -- ends up a barrier to intimacy. You want to fast-forward to the monster if there is one. (""These tracks ... arent human."") The noises are kind of fun like someone played an old haunted-house sound effects LP through a fuzzy shortwave radio. But after a while theyre as hard on the ears as the purposely grainy over- and under-lit mismatched footage is on the eyes. I caught Apollo 18 at noon at my neighborhood movie house (it wasnt shown to critics in advance) and maybe midway through the projector failed and the screen went black. The only other patron an elderly man told the young woman at the refreshment stand that it did seem like a long time without a picture or sound but he thought it was part of the movie. I didnt but I wasnt in a hurry for the problem to be fixed. The darkness and the silence felt nice.

One what if thered been a secret mission to the moon after the Apollo space program was officially discontinued? And two what if the ""found footage"" genre of horror filmmaking were still fresh and original? Pretty hard to swallow I know. I mean Blair Witch Project was 12 years ago. This entry cheap in both budget and imagination purports to be what the astronauts cameras picked up while they were documenting their hush-hush lunar expedition in the 1970s. Mission commander Nathan Walker (Lloyd Owen) and Capt. Ben Anderson (Warren Christie) take a probe to the Moons surface to gather samples and conduct tests while their third wheel (Ryan Robbins) orbits a little jealous that he came all this way but doesnt get to set foot on the moon. But hey guess what? THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING DANGEROUS ON THE MOON Theres nothing wrong with the premise here. Horror movies in which explorers find something inhabiting a place thought to be uninhabited are a subgenre unto themselves and the moon is the most remote and desolate place humans have ever gone. Plus its fun to contemplate alternate answers to the question of why we stopped going there. (""Budgetary concerns""? Pssh. Youre so naive.) To succeed however a movie like this -- with a tiny cast and a narrowly defined area of action -- needs to keep the suspense constant and the thrills frequent and give us interesting characters to hang out with during the downtime. Apollo 18 does neither. Kind of directed by Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego and barely written by Brian Miller its all slow-burn and no payoff. Apart from a few moments of mild tension nothing about the story is compelling. The source of the creepy events when its finally revealed is profoundly dull like a forgettable episode of The X-Files or Fringe. The characters meanwhile are so underwritten and so blandly performed that I cant even muster the energy to be apathetic toward them. This is a disappointingly un-scary execution of a promising idea.

"Apollo 18 Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Apollo 18The documentary-style thriller about a secret lunar mission takes its time to build up to the spooky action.September 03 2011|By Mark Olsen Special to the Los Angeles Times A scene from ""Apollo 18."" (Deminsion Films )Purporting to be edited from 84 hours of footage recently uploaded to the Internet a by whom it is not stated a ""Apollo 18"" would have viewers believe that this is the true story of how NASA and the Department of Defense sent a secret final manned mission to the moon in 1974 after the lunar program had been officially shut down. What the astronauts found there has been kept under wraps ever since. In reality ""Apollo 18"" is a faux found-footage thriller directed by Spanish filmmaker Gonzalo LA3pez-Gallego from a script by newcomer Brian Miller and produced by Russian filmmaker Timur Bekmambetov. The astronauts are played by Warren Christie Lloyd Owen and Ryan Robbins. When it starts to seem that mission leaders back on Earth might be deceiving the astronauts somehow a Watergate is explicitly referenced in conversation a the space explorers realize they are alone with nothing to rely on except themselves and the things at hand. The film takes a startlingly long time to rev up and even at less than 90 minutes feels thin and at moments like it is playing for time. Taking the premise at face value why would anyone putting together ""discovered footage"" take so long to get to the good stuff? Footage from space missions is frequently slightly spooky and unsettling a the meditative fixed camera harsh lighting and odd angles can make the images creepy or sad. The story establishes that the astronauts set up motion-sensor cameras on the moon and carry Kodachrome hand-held cameras with them as a means of explaining how the images were captured and to allow for differences in quality color and texture of the footage. (Patrick Lussier director of the recent ""Drive Angry 3D"" is credited as editor and does a fine job of sorting it all out.) The possibility of being stuck on the moon makes for blunt dramatic essentials and the film is at its best when it is a true chamber piece a couple of astronauts stuck in a landing pod anxiously trying to figure out what to do. The filmmakers are not concerned with how the footage came to be discovered or the physics and realism of what it might really be like if one were attacked by creatures on the moon. Even if ""Apollo 18"" is not exactly as it presents itself to be it is less of a stunt than a low-key and unassuming film of rising tension rather than big scares or wild shocks. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Turtle The Incredible JourneyMay 18 2012Movie review Man on a MissionJanuary 20 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessAstronautsEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-apollo-18-20110903,0,2926130.story",200,apollo184,apollo18,latimes

Credit Dimension Films ""Apollo 18"" a drab combination of science-fiction horror film and conspiracy thriller accomplishes something the world wasnt really crying out for it recreates the tedium of watching the later Apollo missions.Using the found-footage dodge -- were told that everything we see comes from a trove of 84 hours of NASA film discovered online -- the film purports to document a final secret manned mission to the Moon in 1974 two years after Apollo 17. It doesnt explain how the thunderous launching of a Saturn V rocket went unnoticed or (spoiler alert) why another nation put a man on the lunar surface without bothering to tell anyone. (Its also not clear why the cache of film includes happy preflight scenes of the three American astronauts at a backyard barbecue.)The movie the first English-language feature by the Spanish director Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego quickly transports the men to the Moon then settles in for a series of familiar bump-in-the-night scares as they set up equipment gather scientific samples and exchange stilted personal anecdotes during downtime inside the lunar lander. They are not alone of course -- they have company both human and otherwise -- and soon theyre battling predatory creatures and a vast cover-up.Some effort has been expended to recreate the look of the grainy jumpy images that were miraculously beamed back to terrestrial televisions during the Apollo flights but little imagination went toward using that format in the service of an entertaining story or any genuine suspense. All we get is the low-level tension of strange noises flickering lights and shock cuts; when the monsters appear theyre so sketchy whether by design or from lack of budget that you cant believe youve waited around to see them.The coy marketing campaign for ""Apollo 18"" in which everyone involved insisted that the film was a documentary about an actual space flight went to the extreme of never crediting the actors and even on screen they are named late in the closing credits and not identified by their roles. (The closing credits also contain one of the movies wittier touches theyre set to an instrumental version of ""We Three Kings."")

Despite stretches of skillfully sustained suspense ""Apollo 18"" ultimately comes across as little more than a modestly clever stunt. Helmer Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego and first-time scripter Brian Miller aim to infuse fresh life into a familiar scenario by spinning their paranoid tale -- in which U.S. astronauts encounter unfriendly life forms on the dark side of the moon during a secret 1974 NASA mission -- in the found-footage fashion of ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Paranormal Activity."" That gimmickry likely wont be enough to lure massive auds into megaplexes. Still the small-budget filmed-in-Vancouver thriller could find a receptive aud on homevid. ""Apollo 18"" may resonate especially with viewers old enough to recall watching real lunar landings on TV during the era when the pic purportedly is set. To be sure the basic plot already was whiskery by the time Neil Armstrong took one giant leap for mankind back in 1969. But style not substance is the main attraction here and theres an impressively persuasive verisimilitude to the way Lopez-Gallego and his production team (under the overview of producer Timur Bekmambetov) use a variety of visual tropes -- blurry black-and-white video shaky handheld camerawork static-interrupted transmissions from inside spacecraft and aboard lunar rovers faded-color homemovies and ""official interviews"" -- to simulate the look of documentaries about 60s and 70s NASA missions. The pics basic conceit is that it has been culled from hundreds of hours of long-classified footage pertaining to a top-secret lunar mission that began in December 1974 and ended quite badly for all parties involved. ""Apollo 18"" doesnt begin with opening credits (or even the logo of distrib Dimension Films) but rather with the onscreen claim that hey forget everything the government wants you to believe about Apollo 17 being the final U.S.-sponsored interplanetary voyage -- this is the real reason why weve never gone back to the moon. While John Grey (Ryan Robbins) steers the command module in orbit around the moon fellow astronauts Nathan Walker (Lloyd Owen) and Benjamin Anderson (Warren Christie) descend to the lunar surface to install what they think are radar scanners. Unfortunately they discover a Soviet space capsule -- and a deceased Soviet cosmonaut -- near their landing site. Even more unfortunately they gradually discover why that cosmonaut is very seriously dead. ""Apollo 18"" takes a long time to set up its relatively simple premise but the visuals are sufficiently intriguing to alleviate boredom. Once the scary stuff kicks in however its often difficult and occasionally frustrating to suss out precisely whats happening in key scenes as the found-footage flourishes -- jump cuts eruptions of static swervy camera movements etc. -- get in the way of narrative clarity. The three lead actors while reasonably competent are not nearly charismatic enough to turn their thinly written roles into truly compelling characters. On the other hand Lopez-Gallegos decision to offer only fleeting glimpses of the unfriendly life forms -- and absolutely no explanation for their inhospitality toward lunar visitors -- works to the pics advantage by helping to ratchet up the scare factor. Final scenes provide a suitably exciting and darkly ironic payoff though some viewers doubtless will question how some of the found footage ever made its way back to earth.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Earlier this week NASA felt the need to clarify that Apollo 18 is not a documentary but a work of fiction in spite of some marketing claims that suggest otherwise. But what if it wasnt? The film purports to be constructed from footage made during a secret mission to the moon conducted after NASAs last known lunar mission Apollo 17. But for it to be real Apollo 18 would not only have to come from a universe in which American astronauts discovered heretofore-undisclosed mysteries on the moon it would have to come from a universe in which at least some people saw that footage before now and made films inspired by it specifically Alien and The Blair Witch Project. In fairness combining science fiction horror and mockumentary creepiness isnt a terrible idea. Dry NASA footage just needs a nudge into the uncanny to seem spooky and other films most recently The Box have explored the disturbing side of our urge to explore space. But make no mistake Apollo 18 is a terrible movie. Director Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego doesnt seem to understand that going to the far reaches of plausibility makes successful found-footage horror films like Blair Witch The Last Exorcism and the Paranormal Activity movies work. Instead of trusting static shots to build tension or locking viewers into the terrified first-person perspectives of one character or another Apollo 18 is cut cut cut like a lost chapter from Natural Born Killers with mismatched distressed film stocks and an aggressive sound design to match. All that headachy busyness fails to mask an absence of inspiration as an ill-fated team of astronauts head to the moon where they find a seemingly abandoned (and secret) Russian craft plus evidence that the moon might be crawling with--spoiler?--aliens. Unpleasant when it isnt dull Apollo 18 never sells the lost-footage illusion and never compensates for it with scares. Jolts sure. Like so many lazy horror directors Lopez-Gallego knows how to startle but not how to frighten. Worse the astronauts foes once revealed prove more laughable than disturbing and the action remains annoying rather than unnerving as a pair of interchangeable clean-cut astronauts start shouting at each other and rushing from one place to the next as the yelling gets louder. Its an interminable intolerable entry in the cinema of ""What was that??"" In space no one can hear you scream but frustrated sighs are another matter.

Ostensibly tasked with installing Cold War anti-missile systems three American astronauts instead discover that Russians--who seem to have made their own secret voyage to the same remote vicinity and have now disappeared--are a far less urgent threat than extraterrestrial entities of a sneaky shape-shifting nature. Director Gonzalo Lopez-Gallegos mock-verite aesthetics involve endlessly blurry scratchy video (shot by a laughably implausible number of different cameras) and otherworldly howls that ineffectively strive to create suspense from half-glimpsed shadows and indecipherable screaming. His this-is-authentic conceit is by now a tediously corny device and his story delivers no scares during the interminably long uneventful build-up to its deflating climax. Nefarious government plots nostalgic home movies skeletal cosmonaut corpses bodily infection and creepy-crawly aliens all eventually factor into the droning action which indulges in so much distractingly herky-jerky handheld cinematography that any sense of claustrophobic terror is impossible to maintain. Its a conspiracy theory-pandering film that merely reconfirms that most entries in the ""found-footage"" horror subgenre should remain lost.

Or groan. Apollo 18 hopes to tap into the same shivery voyeuristic vein as its found-footage predecessors The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity but it doesnt seem to understand how those films managed to get under our skin. While their half-a-shoestring budgets forced them to be inventive -- transforming mundane sights like shaking tents and swinging doors into conductors of genuine fright -- this purported documentary of the final secret moon landing is just a Hollywood production playing pauper the grainy 16mm film doesn?t mask the fact that the movie is put together with the same juddering editing and bad characterization as most traditionally shot thrillers. Despite one or two effective jump-scares director Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego cant muster the same building sense of dread that carried Paranormal Activity through its many actionless stretches. The demons of that movie followed you back to your own creaking darker-than-you-remembered house but I doubt many will be checking the far corners of their lunar modules. Apollo 18 fails to stay with you because like the cratered satellite on which its set it has no atmosphere.

Daily Edition Login to download Apollo 18 Film Review 1057 AM PDT 9/2/2011 by Frank Scheck FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Weinstein Company This space-set ""found footage"" horror flick never lifts off. TWITTER Not only is this long-delayed horror films form clichA(c)d so is its content. The ""found footage"" horror movie genre that The Blair Witch Project pioneered so successfully has become a numbing cliche. The latest example of this increasingly tired trend is Apollo 18 which purports to show actual footage of an ultra-secret three-man 1974 lunar mission. It comes to us compliments of ""lunartruth.com"" apparently the space-oriented branch of WikiLeaks. After a lengthy delay it is finally hitting movie theaters over Labor Day weekend the cinematic equivalent of entering it in the Witness Protection Program. Not only is this films form cliched so is its content. Composed entirely of the sort of grainy blurry footage that a generation of space buffs grew up watching on television it depicts an ill-fated mission undertaken by three astronauts including two (Warren Christie Lloyd Owen) who land on the lunar surface. There much to their shock they encounter a damaged Russian space capsule and the remains of a cosmonaut who clearly didnt die of natural causes. STORY Apollo 18 Is Not a Documentary Says NASA Violent mayhem inevitably ensues as one of the astronauts falls victim to tiny creepy crawly creatures that get into his space suit his helmet and eventually Alien-style into his body. As his physical condition worsens and he becomes mentally unhinged his partner frantically tries to get help from an increasingly unhelpful Mission Control. STORY Apollo 18 Touches Down For Vancouver Shoot Judging by the seemingly infinite variety of camera angles this was apparently the most photographed mission in the history of space travel. But while director Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego provides suitably ragged and aged visuals that look entirely authentic they quickly prove tiresome and make the brief running time feel endless. The films few scares dont come from anything truly creepy or imaginative but instead from jarring cuts and loud sound effects. The increasingly hysterical performances by the lead actors suggest not so much ultra-cool seasoned astronauts but rather frightened teen boys trapped in a haunted house. A famous tag line from a far better film once declared that ""in space no one can hear you scream."" In the case of Apollo 18 no one will be heard screaming in theaters either.

Joe Neumaier Friday September 2 2011 1235 PM Title Apollo 18 ""Found footage"" purports to tell of a final secret manned moon mission. Director Gonzalo Lopez-Gallego. (126) PG-13. At area theaters.Maybe its time we lose the whole ""found footage"" trend.""Apollo 18"" a slow-as-a-space-walk thriller thats supposed to be a cobbled-together account of an undisclosed 1974 mission to the moon has no thrills no chills no scares and contains a villain or several of them actually that will turn you to stone -- from boredom.All pop-cultural conspiracy theorists have an affinity for the grainy film stock severe buzz-cuts and mysterioso details of the post-""Right Stuff""-era missions as well as for the men who explored the cosmos during the Nixon administration. But thats not enough to stave off the inevitable sense that director Gonzalo Lopez-Gallegos movie is in a deep-space bind It wants to use ""Paranormal Activity""-style creepiness (the old Westinghouse cameras and Kodachrome film stock still create otherworldly images at least) but he needs newfangled monster-flick thrills.So what do we get? Three astronauts heading to the lunar surface and finding a deserted Soviet module a corpse strange footprints ... and some weird little pebbles that sound like Tribbles and turn into spidery rock lobsters that can crawl inside their victims space suits. Then a la ""Alien"" they burrow into their skin though why we dont know why.The dialogue whether spoken in supposed terror or not by the travelers is not exactly on a par with ""One small step for man one giant leap for mankind."" As they shuttle about in their LEM and bounce along the dark side we get ""Hard to believe the sun never shines here. Ever. "" And ""Drop one of those youll get cold in a hurry."" And ""Stay close -- the Russians could be anywhere"" (This last line is delivered without irony seeing as its spoken on the moon not exactly a place known for its hiding places.) But then again this is a secret mission that still got its own official patch like every other so how secret can it be?In space apparently no one can hear you make idiotic movies.
