Reyes covers familiar ground without stumbling or dazzling in ""Empire"" about an upwardly mobile hustler whos undone by his own ambitions. Cast and subject matter may generate modest interest in cable and homevid venues. John Leguizamo is deadly serious and highly effective as Victor Rosa a Latino drug dealer whose crew peddles a popular heroin mix (known as Empire) on the mean streets of the South Bronx. Through a classmate (Denise Richards) of his girlfriend (Delilah Cotto) Victor connects with Jack Wimmer (Peter Sarsgaard) a WASPy investment banker who openly admires Victors entrepreneurial skill. Victor profits from one of Jacks ventures and borrows heavily from Latina drug kingpin La Columbiana (a miscast but game Isabella Rossellini) to invest in another. Unfortunately Jack turns out to be more treacherous than any drug interloper. ""Empire"" traffics in easy ironies about amoral pursuits of the American Dream but scores a few provocative points about class-consciousness and moral relativism. Leguizamo manages a couple of genuinely poignant moments as Victors bright new world of respectability falls apart. Tech package is adequate. Exploitable soundtrack includes cuts by Marc Anthony Ludacris and Naughty by Nature. EmpireProductionA Bigel/Mailer Films production. Produced by Daniel Bigel Michael Mailer. Executive producer Robert B. Campbell. Co-producers John Leguizamo Jill Footlick. Co-executive producers Evan Lamberg Steven Beer. Written directed by Franc. Reyes. CrewCamera (color) Kramer Morgenthau; editor Peter C. Frank; music Ruben Blades; production designer Ted Glass; art director Frank White.

"Empire Gangster Tale Sleeps With the Fishes washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Empire Gangster Tale Sleeps With the Fishes Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday December 6 2002 A vivid vital movie has been made about New Yorks underworld a film that pounds and pulses with the brutal life force of young men living on the edge of unlimited potential and early death. That film is ""GoodFellas"" and it is available at your nearest video store. You might also pick up ""Mean Streets"" while youre at it. By no means be fooled into seeing ""Empire"" a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by Martin Scorsese. Such invidious comparisons are required in assessing a movie that begs borrows and outright steals from its more illustrious predecessors. ""Empires"" writer-director Franc. Reyes is a onetime choreographer and sometime composer of pop songs; what he knows about making movies he clearly gleaned from studying Scorsese as well as such Scorsese acolytes as Spike Lee with the voraciousness of a magpie. In ""Empire"" which stars John Leguizamo as a Bronx heroin dealer named Victor Rosa Reyes makes heavy use of Scorseses signature camera movements slow-motion effects and jittery editing. He surely steals nearly every play in the ""GoodFellas"" book from the opening introductions of the films seedy characters to a scene in which Victor leaves his SUV parked on a dangerous Bronx street. No one touches the car he explains in the films tiresome voice-over. ""And you know why? Respect."" At that point one half-expects Tony Bennett to start belting ""Rags to Riches."" ""Empire"" is being advertised as something of a gangster sting movie wherein Victors character is hoodwinked by a smarmy Wall Street investor named Jack Wimmer (Peter Sarsgaard in a terrifically fey performance) and then gets back at the rich guy using street smarts and South Bronx muscle. It turns out that Victor is hoodwinked not only by Wimmer but by the latters voluptuous girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards whose Jeanne Moreau pout seems to get more pillowy in each movie). But sadly ""Empire"" has next to nothing to do with the mind games of its main characters and much more to do with a bunch of beefy guys shooting at each other - quite sloppily - with very big guns. Leguizamo is a gifted comedian and a chameleonlike actor but his talents are wasted in this portrait of New York greed which is as tiresome as it is anachronistic (the World Trade Center is still intact in the movie as is the dot-com boom). And what in heavens name is Isabella Rossellini doing tarted up as a Colombian drug dealer? Or Sonia Braga as a haggard-looking matriarch? The best part of ""Empire"" is Ruben Blades swinging swelling musical score which is interspersed with some good Latin pop songs. (""Empire"" is the first release of Universals Arenas label dedicated to tapping the Latino audience.) Still the endless posing and fake gunplay and ginned-up violence and acrid profanity have an effect every bit as soporific as Victors most sought-after product. If you find yourself nodding off in the first half-hour just chalk it up to being in the ""Empire"" state. EMPIRE (R 90 minutes) - Contains violence pervasive profanity drug content and some sexuality. At area theaters.

Starring John Leguizamo Peter Sarsgaard and Denise Richards. Directed by Franc. Reyes. (R. 108 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The tale of a gangster who grows up in poverty and pursues the American dream with a gun is as old as the talkies. But ""Empire"" finds something new in the old story for the simple reason that it doesnt take its inspiration from movies but from the streets and it shows. The result is that ""Empire"" -- the debut film of Arenas Entertainment a Latino division of Universal Pictures -- is a gangster movie with the capacity to surprise. People do unexpected things and for reasons we wouldnt anticipate. Even the tone of familiar scenes is just a little different. Gangland hits here are more clumsy and personal more small-town and familial than in the usual gangster movie. The fresh take makes for a fresh experience. Written and directed by Franc. Reyes ""Empire"" tells the story of a South Bronx heroin dealer Victor (John Leguizamo) who sees himself as a businessman in the tradition of Carnegie Rockefeller and Bill Gates. Other movie crooks have compared themselves to legitimate businessmen as a way of rationalizing their crimes but Victor is something different He really believes it. This healthy self-image gives Victor a spring in his step and a distinctly American belief in his own destiny. To his mind hes not at war with his countrys values but is the embodiment of its entrepreneurial spirit. Underneath his gold chain beats the heart of a natural Republican. Reyes in his first feature relies on lots of voice-over narration from Victors point of view. Reyes doesnt use it awkwardly as many beginning filmmakers do for the sake of plugging holes in the narrative. The narration is built into the fabric and is used audaciously -- not as flashy as the narration in say Scorseses ""Casino"" or ""GoodFellas"" but getting there. Victors aspirations make it inevitable that hell someday try to go legit and he sees his opportunity one night when he meets Jack an investment banker played by Peter Sarsgaard. Jack is one of those 30-year-old geniuses that until recently actually existed Ivy League education first million at 25 Midas touch with the stock market. Jack has a great Manhattan townhouse and lots of ""investment opportunities"" for Victor. Sarsgaard conveys the ease of a young man at home with wealth and all it buys. He talks big numbers -- 60 million 600 million -- like someone who lives in that world. Jack is low-key shrewd sure of himself. Sarsgaards performance is persuasive in every way and makes it clear why Victor whos a prince in his own sphere would look at Jack in awe. Its not just Jacks money that Victor aspires to. Its his relaxation. Leguizamo keeps Victor sympathetic by emphasizing his intelligence and his desire for a more genteel life. When Victor goes back to the old neighborhood after living for several months in a downtown loft he feels he has nothing to say to his old friends and wants nothing to do with his old life. His girlfriend (Delilah Cotto) is disgusted by his snobbishness and by his inability to recognize his real friends but director Reyes is wise enough to keep the movies point of view ambiguous. Maybe Victor doesnt belong in the dishonest glamour of downtown but the honest bleakness of the South Bronx is no haven either. ""Empire"" is set in the days of ""peace and prosperity"" as Jack puts it and it has the New York skyline shots of the World Trade Center to prove it. Jack Victor the stock market and New York itself are right on the edge and the audience can feel it. In the end the story of ""Empire"" gets completely crazy and pretty improbable as if Reyes quit writing about what he knew and started throwing in any wild thing he could think of. Still the movie stays compelling if only because we can never guess where it might go. . This film contains lots of graphic violence harsh language and some sexual situations.

The division was formed to create entertainment for Latino audiences worldwide. Its acutely disappointing that the first movie out of the gate is this stereotypical banally written bloodbath. Almost every Latino actor (or any actor of color) has complained about Hollywoods repeated insistence on portraying them as drug dealers violent street thugs maids or gang members. One would think the folks at Universals Arenas which is run by Latinos would be sensitive to this concern. But Empires plot centers on drug dealers and violent thugs who cheat kill and put money above all else. Bullets fly in stylized fashion accompanied by trite dialogue and heavy-handed moralizing. Movie review Empire ( out of four) Stars John Leguizamo Peter Sarsgaard Denise Richards Director Franc Reyes Distributor Universal Pictures Rating R for strong violence pervasive language drug content and some sexuality Opens Friday nationwide John Leguizamo stars as Victor Rosa a Bronx-based dealer of an ultra-pure heroin mixture called Empire. The actor does his level best with the limited material and manages to convey a full range of emotions with his expressive face and considerable talent. Others in this cliche film dont fare as well. Particularly dismal is Denise Richards an actress of minimal acting skill at best. Shes the uptown girlfriend of the boyish Jack (Peter Sarsgaard) a Wall Street investment banker who offers to cut Victor in on a biotech deal that he predicts will make millions. ""Its as close to a sure thing as anything can get"" he simpers. Trafficking in human genomes is now the safest investment for a shady businessman hoping to go legit? Not that we believe for a nanosecond that Jack is on the level. (One clue that hes not a straight-arrow Wall Streeter is the bash he throws at his penthouse that is attended by scores of artsy types and a few naked women frolicking in a bubble bath.) He comes off as whiny while the assortment of lowlife street dealers mostly seems pathetic or unhinged. Or both. Isabella Rossellini plays a Colombian drug lord which may get the prize for the years weirdest casting choice. Leguizamos character keeps up a running narrative on the goings-on vacillating between pseudo-street wisdom and empty moralizing. ""You know a mans actions always have their consequences"" he intones at the movies violent conclusion. Too bad the filmmakers didnt think about the consequences of glamorizing the seedy world of ""street pharmaceuticals"" and exporting it globally to Hispanics hungry for substantive portrayals of their culture. ""For everybody money is what its all about"" Leguizamos Victor rationalizes. ""Dollars are all that matter here."" The same could be said for the efforts of writer-director Franc. Reyes and Universal Pictures.

Writer-director Franc Reyes impressively polished debut works on two levels. On the surface its a satisfyingly down-and-dirty melodrama about a South Bronx heroin dealer named Victor (John Leguizamo) whos looking to make one last big score so he can finally get out of the game. But between bursts of automatic gunfire the story offers a trenchant critique of capitalism as Victor gets mixed up with an even more ruthless player Wall Street high roller Jack Wimmer (""Boys Dont Cry""s Peter Sarsgaard oozing sleaze in a potentially star-making turn). The grab-bag ensemble encompasses not only Rossellini (as a flamboyant drug queen done up like Liz Taylor circa 1963) and Fat Joe (as a street pusher with a soft spot for his PlayStation-obsessed son) but also Denise Richards a perfect Malibu Barbie as Jacks insipid girlfriend. Still Leguizamo owns ""Empire"" the first film to capture the live-wire crackle of his one-man stage shows (""Sexaholix...A Love Story"" ""Spic-O-Rama""). Hes front and center in nearly every scene and he holds the screen with a simmering self-assurance. ""Empire"" reunites Leguizamo with Nestor Serrano (in the chilling role of Rossellinis hit-man brother) his castmate from the late writer-director Joseph B. Vasquezs sadly forgotten 1991 indie comedy ""Hangin With the Homeboys."" A sweeter-souled South Bronx tale ""Homeboys"" got lost in the ""Boyz N the Hood""-era crowd of inner-city flicks. Amid the annual crush of Christmas-season releases it would be a crime if ""Empire"" were to wind up getting similarly dissed.

What Issue? 12 years ago by Paul Moses Dear International Olympic Committee inspectors I hope you dont mind but I somehow picture your team of International Olympic Committee inspectors as a bumbling crew of Inspector Clouseau types.
