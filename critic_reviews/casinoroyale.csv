One such occasion is the opening scene of Casino Royale in which James Bond confronts a turncoat within British intelligence. Bond is played by Daniel Craig in his rookie outing and he is played appropriately enough as a rookie agent or at least as one who has not yet been granted his iconic label ""007."" To ascend to that rank we are told requires two sanctioned kills--one evidently for each ""oh."" His first was the man who led him to the turncoat and it was not a pretty one Bond beat him bloodily before drowning him in the sink of a public restroom. ""Made you feel it didnt he?"" the turncoat asks. ""Well you neednt worry the second is--."" Rather than complete the thought he fulfills it as Bond casually shoots him through the chest before concurring ""Yes considerably."" The word that neither man utters of course is ""easier"" and its elision is telling. This is the first Bond movie in decades perhaps ever that respects its audience enough to let them fill in the trope for themselves. From its first frames Casino Royale just released on video promises to restore the trimmed-down urgency of the early Sean Connery outings as Bond before the franchise grew so fat and tired and stupid The MGM lion and the Columbia Pictures torch-lady are both presented in black and white; when onscreen type announces that the first scene is set in Prague theres a knowing pause as if to hint this could be some Cold War-era John le Carre adaptation (The Spy Who Loved to Come in from the Cold?) before it confesses its era with ""Czech Republic."" But Casino Royale exceeds this promise presenting a Bond both leaner and meaner than any that has come before. That this is the best Bond flick in nearly four decades is beyond reasonable dispute; whether its better even than the early Connerys is a subject worthy of debate. Who could have imagined that the franchise could lift itself up so quickly from the laughable depths of Die Another Day with its invisible cars and one-man war against the North Korean Army? Though Casino Royale was produced by the same folks responsible for that self-parodying rubbish it feels as though the rights to the story somehow fell into the hands of an outsider who fashioned the film as a ""fuck you"" to Bonds official custodians. Rebukes to the franchises errors and excesses are everywhere an opening action sequence that consists merely (but marvelously) of two men chasing one another on foot through a construction site; Bonds joke to his female partner that her cover-name is ""Miss Stephanie Broadchest""; the villains explanation ""I never understood all these elaborate tortures"" before he pummels Bonds privates with a knotted rope; Bonds response when asked whether hed like his martini shaken or stirred ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" It is an almost inexpressible relief that the niftiest spy gadget in the entire film is the medical kit hidden in Bonds car. Unlike recent Bonds whose kills had no more weight than the one-liners that generally accompanied them Craigs tend to be intimate bloody and devoid of glamour the restroom murder that opens the movie; a slow painful strangulation in the bottom of a stairwell. In the latter half of the movie alone Craig goes through more tuxedo shirts--gore-soaked waterlogged shredded--than Roger Moore seemed to dirty during his entire Bond tenure. Craig is also the first Bond who is not openly pleasure-seeking whose sexual escapades are clearly intended to further his mission rather than the other way around. This correction is made most explicit when Bond engages in some light foreplay with a Bahamian lovely in order to find out what her villainous husband might be up to. ""Apparently hes on the last flight to Miami"" she informs him between nibbles ""so you have all night to question me."" In response Bond phones room service to send up a little beluga and bubbly. But when hes asked ""For two sir?"" his reply is terse ""No one."" Cut to him speeding to the airport. The last several Bonds would probably have let it wait til morning; even Connery would at least have allowed himself a wistful sigh at his coital self-sacrifice. Its as if the franchise at last felt forced to decide between carnal vocations for its hero and opted wisely for assassin over gigolo. Even the opening credits forsake the tease of quasi-naked jiggle bunnies in favor of a neatly stylized series of animated executions. And Craig makes a superb assassin. Its not just that he seems more likely to have killed someone than any of his smirking predecessors; its that he seems likely to have killed them with his forehead. Though a handsome actor (and according to a disconcerting number of female friends the sexiest man on the big screen in ages) Craig has not a whiff of prettiness to him. His face is angular but unlovely the mouth a little wide the brow a little heavy the eyes tilting down morosely at the sides. Hes the first Bond one doesnt envision spending a great deal of time in front of the mirror. (The gym is another matter Hes so lean you could use him to cut vegetables.) The film does let down Craigs performance (and viewers) here and there. The plot meanders a bit before arriving at its titular destination a high-stakes poker game pitting Bond against Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen) a man who is described as the ""private banker to the worlds terrorists"" and who like the statue of a medieval saint weeps tears of blood. The game itself is staged rather inertly (and according to those who know something about cards ridiculously). And the movies denouement suffers a bit from Return of the Kingitis You think its over several times before it actually is. But given the revelatory improvement over the last dozen-plus Bond outings these are quibbles. Regarding Bonds love interest a heretically fetching accountant named Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) the film reaches high but falls a little short. Its certainly nice to see Bonds custodians strive for a genuine romance a sharp sparring between attracted minds (and yes not only minds). But the chemistry between Craig and Green is never much in evidence their repartee isnt quite so clever as the filmmakers think and her eventual surrender (whatever its explanation) is too abrupt and too complete to be satisfying. This is the second film in which 007 has fallen truly in love and the second time that love was doomed. The first was On Her Majestys Secret Service starring another freshman Bond--Aussie model George Lazenby who took over from Connery in 1969 but never made it to a sophomore outing. Like Casino Royale it too followed Ian Flemings novel relatively closely downplayed gadgetry in favor of dramatic depth and served as a kind of explanation for Bonds darker treatment of the fairer sex. Despite a somewhat leaden performance by Lazenby its among the best of the Bond films (thanks largely to the magnificent Diana Rigg the Bond Girl against whom all others must be measured) and it might have offered a model for reinvigorating the franchise. Instead it was followed by Diamonds Are Forever a lamely semi-comic gizmo-stuffed entry that foreshadowed the disappointing decades to come. Theres no real reason to expect that Casino Royale will have a similar one-and-done quality. The fact that it has been widely described as a ""reboot"" suggests at least some awareness by the producers that the franchise had crashed; and Daniel Craigs decision to return for another tour is good news indeed. Still in mass-market filmmaking its often easier to throw in a space-based laser than a good line of dialogue and its an open question how long the franchise will be able to resist such temptations. But for now Bond fans have--for the first time in a long long time--something to savor. The Home Movies List Rebooting Bond Casino Royale (1967). After acquiring the rights to Flemings novel producer Charles K. Feldman initially wanted it to be part of the usual Bond ""canon."" When gatekeepers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman turned him away he instead opted to make it a spoof. Sadly star Peter Sellers wanted to play Bond ""straight"" feuded with Orson Welles (his Le Chiffre) and quit before completing his footage--a departure that forced the filmmakers to reframe the entire film as a kaleidoscope of competing ""Bonds"" (David Niven Woody Allen Ursula Andress et cetera). A disaster from beginning to end too pitiful even to laugh at. On Her Majestys Secret Service (1969). Great moments in career management Lazenby turned down a seven-picture deal because he felt the tuxedoed Bond was too square to flourish in the counter-cultural 1970s. Instead he went on to a career starring in martial arts pictures spoofing Bond (The Nude Bomb The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.) and marrying former tennis pro Pam Shriver. The Living Daylights (1987). Another attempt to return Bond to his darker more serious roots that didnt really pan out. Dalton whod first been offered the role of Bond for On Her Majestys Secret Service (when he was in his early 20s) never quite had the big-screen charisma for the role and lasted just two pictures. Austin Powers International Man of Mystery (1997). A spoof along the lines of the first Casino Royale that succeeded far better--Bond by way of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls ""The Bionic Woman"" A Hard Days Night and Alfie. The Matador (2005). Pierce Brosnans most winning portrayal of Bond wasnt Bond at all but the wickedly decadent and self-loathing assassin Julian Noble in this underrated black comedy. It almost seems as though Brosnan needed to kill off the Bond mystique once and for all before Daniel Craig could give it new life.This post originally appeared at TNR.com.

Twitter previousPredictions Are Hard Especially About the FuturenextLeft Behind Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Mike Segar / Reuters The Most Inspiring and Depressing Moment of the Democratic Convention Uri Friedman The father of a Muslim American who died in Iraq confronts Donald Trump. Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides.

Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Daniel Craig brings us a new James Bond in Casino Royale. Hes not only rugged fearless and -- when the chips are down as they often are in this poker-faced thriller -- a lethal weapon. Hes also vulnerable. This blond 007 falls in love and wonders whether that might not be better for him than being a globe-trotting killer. This not only shakes him up it shakes up the franchise in its 21st official outing. Bond as a human being? Whodathunk? Of course this Bond wasnt even born by the time Sean Connery had churned out five double-oh epics. The series already had turned silly by that time with motorboats flying over bridges and car tailpipes turning into machine guns. Craig brings it back to life not with gadgets -- all he has is a nifty glove compartment -- but with derring-do that gets daring-done with panache. The chase on a construction crane is pretty breathless. But his finest moment may be when he finds his girlfriend shaken after a machete battle in a stairwell (hows that for low-tech?) sitting in her bloodied evening gown in a shower. Most men would turn the water off and pull her into their arms. Craigs Bond does something none of the blown-dry pretenders since Connery would ever have done He joins her in the shower not for sex or to make a joke but because hes starting to fall for her and she clearly needs a shoulder to lean on. And she leans. A moment or two later hes back playing poker. And not long after that half a world away a building is falling down around their heads. But that moment of tenderness has done what decades of special effects havent been able to do made you care about what happens to 007.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Somebody Does It Better Reinvention indeed Daniel Craig is a Bond we could get used to seeing in a tuxedo. By David Edelstein Published Oct 25 2007 ShareThis (Photo Jay Maidment/Dan Jaq/United Artists Corporation/Courtesy of Sony Pictures) A fter serving up a sleek male mannequin in four so-so films the corporate executives of the James Bond franchise have opted for his opposite in Casino Royale Bond as a bit of rough trade. And hes good Better than that hes what Bond hasnt been in a quarter-century since a certain rugged Scot said Never again. Hes fascinating. As 007 Daniel Craig tilts his head forward like a boxer an impression reinforced by his semi-smashed nose and sandpaper skin that often sports fresh lacerations. But those radioactive blue eyes make him something more than a bullyboy. This Bond is haunted not yet housebroken still figuring out the persona. In Casino Royale the reset button has been pressed in the manner of Batman Begins. Judi Dench is back as the scolding distaff M but Bond has only recently been licensed to kill and those kills are still a shock. Were grateful when the latest Bond girl Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) shows up and engages 007 in an impudent game of Whats My Backstory? She guesses he has had the best education money can buy but didnt come from moneyand that he still carries a chip on his shoulder about the elites. That fits. Still questions linger. Who were Bonds parents? How did he become a secret agent? Why does he chase a bad guy up an enormous crane over the ocean when he could just uh wait for the man to come down? The last question is rhetorical. Even in this more down-to-earth Bond film serious acrobatics are required to hurtle us over the narrative chasms. The director is Martin Campbell who also made Pierce Brosnans generally flaccid debut GoldenEye. He doesnt screw up this time. Working with the crack editor Stuart Baird Campbell propels Bond (and his quarries) onto impossible precipices and stands back while the worlds highest-paid stuntpeople earn their paychecks. In the early Bond movies the violence was both brutal and stylish with witty curlicues; here its mostly brutal but at least the director has a Hong Kongstyle awe for the poetry of human bodies doing things that evolutionarily speaking they havent needed to do since the saber-toothed tiger died off. The first half of Casino Royale is full of happy surprises. The Bond tropes are all there but in the script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (andwowPaul Haggis) theyre rearranged to catch you off guard. The opening bit with 007 firing into the gun sight and the blood running down the frame is cunningly delayed. Shaken not stirred gets a twist of something acid. Bond. James Bond is saved for a special moment. The villain is not the usual Blofeld-like wannabe world dominator but a financier called Le Chiffre whose milky eye weeps blood. Hes played by the amazing Dane Mads Mikkelsen made up to bring out his liver lips and Munchian cheekbonesthe clammiest actor alive. When Bond sits opposite Le Chiffre at a high-stakes poker game in Montenegros Casino Royale Mikkelsen clicks his rectangular plaques as if hes a new breed of praying mantis. Hes bloodcurdling. He needs to be since Casino Royale mysteriously front-loads the big action set pieces and then settles into something considerably more cerebraland a wee bit anticlimactic. (Le Chiffre deserves a better comeuppance.) Even at its most languorous though the movie never loses its pulseand it never lost my goodwill. You can always ogle the luscious Eva Green (best known for Bertoluccis The Dreamers) whose Vesper is teasing angry and vulnerable in madly unpredictable proportions. You can study Daniel Craig as Bond searches for a rakish comeback and comes up short. No this is not a design for all Bond pictures. By all means lets have the gadgets the super-villains and the hero who can tell you not just the vintage but the side of the chateau where the grapes were grown. But lets also have the joy of rediscovering all that. In one scene Vesper presents Bond with a tuxedo for the casino. He slips into it and regards himself in the mirrorhe cant believe how beautifully tailored it is. I hope Craig finds more moments like that in Bond. And I hope he gets to wear that tuxedo again and again and again. Even more welcome than a new Bond is a new Guest a semi-improvised comedy from Christopher and his ensemble of soulful clowns among them Catherine OHara Eugene Levy Parker Posey Fred Willard Jane Lynch Harry Shearer and Michael McKeanbig winners who love playing big losers. For Your Consideration is a behind-the-scenes look at the shooting of a very very bad Deep South ethnic Jewish lesbian family drama called Home for Purim. The joke (apart from Yiddishisms spoken in a drawl) is that a report posted on the Web sparks Oscar buzz that races to all corners of the industryleading to talk-show appearances by the pathetically not-hot stars and the arrival of a studio executive (Ricky Gervais the pictures exchange student) to push for less in-your-face Jewishness. 1 2 Next Share this story...

"New Bonds Stormy Virility Trumps Connery and Moore | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Style amp; Design Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters New Bonds Stormy Virility Trumps Connery and Moore By Andrew Sarris  11/27/06 1200am Martin Campbells Casino Royale from a screenplay by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Paul Haggis based on the novel by Ian Fleming happens to be the 21st James Bond movie as well as the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007 and that includes even Sean Connery from his (and the franchises) debut in 1962 with Dr. No through From Russia with Love (1963) Goldfinger (1964) Thunderball (1965) You Only Live Twice (1967) and after a one-picture hiatus Diamonds Are Forever (1971). Curiously that single non-Connery hiatus Bond 1969s On Her Majestys Secret Service--with the much-underrated George Lazenby as 007 and the exquisite Diana Rigg as the Italian countess he loves marries and mourns--is actually my second-favorite entry in the series. Certainly Roger Moore was a comparatively lightweight Bond with his seven appearances in the series Live and Let Die (1973) The Man with the Golden Gun (1974) The Spy Who Loved Me (1977) Moonraker (1979) For Your Eyes Only (1981) Octopussy (1983) and A View to a Kill (1985). Mr. Moore was succeeded briefly by Timothy Dalton in The Living Daylights (1987) and License to Kill (1989). Actually Mr. Dalton came the closest to Mr. Craig in projecting stormy virility and it was rumored that he did most of his own stunts. Still Mr. Daltons vehicles were considered impediments to the flagging but still profitable property. Pierce Brosnan stepped into the breach with Goldeneye (1995) ably directed by Martin Campbell who was to direct Casino Royale more than a decade later. Indeed Mr. Brosnan was graced with unusually ambitious directors for his next (and last) three films in the franchise Roger Spottiswoodes Tomorrow Never Dies (1997) Michael Apteds The World Is Not Enough (1999) and Lee Tamahoris Die Another Day (2002). My recurring problem with Mr. Connerys Bond vis-a-vis Mr. Craigs--admittedly in retrospect--is that though Mr. Connery was the coolest and smoothest of all the Bonds his coolness and smoothness would curdle over the course of a movie into a smug facetiousness. I must hasten to add that this wasnt true of most of his non-Bond roles. Of course Casino Royale has been adapted from Flemings first novel about 007 and so the character can profit from the vulnerability of a novice agent pitted against an ever more evil world. Bonds relationship with his superior M (Judi Dench) in London gets off to a rocky start when he blows up an African embassy in Madagascar after a spectacular pursuit of an agile bomb-dealer named Mollaka (Sebastien Foucan). The joke is that the whole city seems to be under construction enabling Bond and Mollaka to exploit every unfinished construction site and skeletal edifice in their chase. The grim-faced Mr. Craig has already been introduced as a deadpan killer with a sense of humor about his comparatively new vocation but it is a dry-as-dust humor that he purveys. I must confess that at first I couldnt tell him apart from the villains in the crowd scenes--and this is good for a supposed undercover agent. As he flits about with seeming effortlessness from Madagascar to the Bahamas to Montenegro to Venice for the movies watery climax--part of the franchises formula--he never loses control of a character who manages to be stoical and feverish at one and the same time. Even when he is poisoned to within a heartbeat of death and then later tortured in the most imaginatively painful way some irreducible part of Mr. Craigs Bond remains on the alert. The poisoning occurs during a titanically high-stakes poker game in a Montenegrin gambling casino--a sequence that seems unusually prolonged possibly to justify the title of the film and its opening playing-card credits. (There are spoilers to follow so readers of tender sensibility should avert their eyes here.) After the high suspense created by visual cues attesting to the hypnotic power of kings and jacks Bond finally wins his showdown with the arch villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) with a low-black-card straight flush beating Le Chiffres high-card full house. It helps that Le Chiffre is afflicted with an ocular problem that causes him to shed tears of blood; it also helps the film that Mr. Mikkelsen is slightly better looking than Mr. Craig making the battle between good and evil onscreen visually more complex. From her first briefing of 007 M makes it crystal clear that no ideological issues are involved in Bonds hunt for arms merchants in the bomb trade; the only motive for Le Chiffre his cohorts and even his enemies is money. This disclaimer neatly severs Casino Royale from the never-ending war on terror both here and in Britain which may be a good thing for the film--Bond is thereby released from getting an uncharacteristically patriotic gleam in his eye as he disposes of his antagonists. What distinguishes Mr. Craigs Bond from all the others except Mr. Lazenbys is his expression of both passion and grief after winning and losing Eva Greens Vesper Lynd who seems for a time to have betrayed him--though as it turns out she has saved his life not once but twice. The relationship begins on the comically sarcastic note that always bodes well for any movie relationship. Vesper displays a flair for the veiled insult and Bond responds with a faintly amused curiosity. But he has been chastened by a previous affair that has gone badly for the married woman he recklessly bedded. The world he lives in is too dangerous for him to lightly contemplate another romantic adventure but the rush of violent circumstances drive Vesper and Bond into each others arms where they remain until their prior alliances rise up to engulf them. That Bond so convincingly retains his composure and sang-froid throughout all the horrors that ensue is a testament to Mr. Craigs abilities as an actor and to Mr. Campbells astuteness as a director. People might think that my guiding mantra for Casino Royale and On Her Majestys Secret Service (and most other movies as well) happens to be cherchez la femme. But change that to aimez la femme and Id plead pleasurably guilty even as I wholeheartedly recommend Casino Royale as one of the best pictures of the year--not that it will need much help at the box office. Southern Belles Joey Lauren Adams Come Early Morning from her own screenplay gives Ashley Judd her best role since she sizzled in the 90s in Victor Nunezs Ruby in Paradise (1993) Michael Manns Heat (1995) and John McNaughtons Normal Life (1996). Ms. Adams shot her country-folk character study in North Little Rock Ark. where she grew up and it shows in her lack of malice and condescension toward her subject. For that matter Ms. Judd grew up in eastern Kentucky and so there isnt much that the films protagonist and its writer-director dont know about the real-life background from which plaintive country music springs. We are introduced very quickly to the disreputable one-night-standish side of Ms. Judds Lucy Fowler in a disheveled motel bedroom by the dawns ugly light. Lucy is trying without success to kick out a growly pickup that she has slept with and so she dresses quickly and leaves him hurling insults at her for not showing more early-morning interest in him. Then a strange thing happens She walks into the motel office and insists that the nights frolic be put on her bill even though her ""date"" has gallantly paid for the room in advance. We thereby learn economically that Lucy brings different pickups to the motel on a regular basis and thus are spared the necessity of enduring too many of these grubby nights and early mornings. Our next surprise comes when Lucy drives for what seems like an eternity to the neatly kept cottage that she shares with Kim (Laura Prepon) an apparently nice girl who clearly gets along with her even though she doesnt go for Lucys brand of night-crawling and heavy drinking. Our third surprise comes when we suddenly see Lucy in a hard hat surveying a field with her boss Owen (Stacy Keach) and discussing a shady civic ordinance that will cost Owens firm a considerable amount of money. Lucys job it turns out is that of a contractor involved in building cement foundations. We are gradually becoming more interested in this unexpectedly self-supporting and self-sufficient woman who is apparently battling some mysterious demons. She is certainly not the usual female victim of societys shortcomings encountered in movies but rather a spunky single woman who can dish it out and take it too. But why is she so tormented? We learn very gradually that Lucys mother is dead and that her father Lowell (Scott Wilson) is a heavy-drinking recluse who has never gotten over the guilt he feels for having driven his wife to an early grave through his womanizing. Lowell has never been able to communicate with his daughter and he never manages to do so here--that would be too easy and sentimental. He does allow Lucy to accompany him to church for Sunday services where they listen to a preacher talking intimately about Jesus without seeming ridiculous. Finally Lucy runs into a one-night stand named Cal (Jeffrey Donovan) who seems to promise more. He persuades her to go frog-fishing with him then cooks the frogs for Lucy and Kim back at their place. The two women make very comical faces upon tasting this strange ""delicacy"" which they never really considered a culinary treat from the outset. Somehow this trivial setback seems to be a forerunner of deeper problems between Lucy and Cal. Later when Lucy returns to her favorite hangout the Forge where she drinks to the strains of country music on the jukebox and shoots pool with another older father figure in her strangely chaperoned existence (at least until she manages to pick someone up for another brief encounter) she bumps into Cal again--just as the old ""date"" we saw in the beginning begins pawing at her for an encore. She resists and Cal intervenes and gets into a brawl with the man--which unaccountably infuriates Lucy. She then agrees to go off with another less aggressive suitor and Cal leaves in disgust. But then comes the final surprise which clinched the movie for me When Lucy gets in the strangers car she bursts into tears--and the stranger politely asks her to get out because as he says perceptively she obviously has unfinished business with Cal and he doesnt want to get in the middle of it. He then drives off alone. I cant remember ever seeing such a demonstration of generosity on the part of filmmakers toward an easily stereotyped minor character in a movie. Unfortunately Come Early Morning seems on the verge of disappearing into the flood of holiday-season releases. I was drawn to the movie which happens to be Ms. Adams directorial debut because I remembered the intelligence and feeling of her brilliant performance in Kevin Smiths Chasing Amy (1997). If and when Come Early Morning ever resurfaces on DVD order it immediately--and while youre at it order Chasing Amy too if you havent already seen it and enjoy a dandy double feature with two country girls of enormous talent.

What you havent heard is this Craig is also the best Bond in the franchises history. I can easily take on gadget-dependent Roger Moore fans pussyish Dalton defenders and Brosnan apologists. Even Seans in my sights. Craig brings him down. Its not just in the way he tersely answers the bartenders expected shaken-or-stirred inquiry (""Do I look like I give a damn?"") or the way this exceptional actor can curl his voice into a crisp hateful Mamet-worthy snarl even when hes wooing The Dreamers Eva Green herself the most believably smart Bond girl in ages. What makes Craigs Bond better than Connerys has to do with a complete reinvention of the concept This is a screwed-up Bond a rogue Bond one who brings shame upon Judi Denchs M with his unruliness one who infiltrates the high-stakes poker tournament of an evil terrorist banker (Mikkelsen weeping tears of blood) wearing an unstudied gamblers face. Hes a bounder a scrapper and in the movies astoundingly bleak coda an openhearted lover. Casino Royale still works as a trad Bond film; its opening parkour chase much of it staged on high beams of a construction project looks truly dangerous. But apart from its animated credits its not so groovy anymore--and good riddance. This is a Bond film for the tougher age of Croupier The Good Thief and Ronin. High time.

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News Anyone who has followed the James Bond series even casually over the years knows that there have been serviceable Bonds (Roger Moore) blase Bonds (George Lazenby) and vaguely unobjectionable Bonds (Pierce Brosnan). But if the greatest Bond is still Sean Connery -- his chipped-ice elegance so clearly defined the franchise that theres no replacing him -- then Daniel Craig is the first Botticelli Bond. In Martin Campbells blissfully entertaining ""Casino Royale"" the 21st picture in the 007 franchise Craig is Bond reinvented and reborn a creature so unexpectedly distinctive that even though we all think we know what we want in a Bond we could never have dreamed this one up. Hes not what we think of as the classic Bond type His body isnt a tuxedo-ready balanced equation but a wedge of muscle that demands clever tailoring. His profile with its coulda been a contender nose is so strong and beautiful it wouldnt be out of place on a Greek amphora -- yet his ears jutting out with boyish awkwardness look more like the handles. But his charisma both overrides and enhances any physical attributes. Emerging from the sea after a swim with his lady love hes a scrappy blond god in tiny blue swim shorts; the moment is a clear visual nod to Ursula Andress in ""Dr. No"" but also an unwitting reference to Venus on the half shell. This is Bond as weve never seen him more naked alive and mysterious than ever. ""Casino Royale"" is almost everything you want in a Bond movie as well as everything you didnt know you wanted. Campbell has directed one other Bond picture the 1995 ""GoldenEye."" But ""Casino Royale"" at least in terms of its action sequences takes more of its cues from Campbells two terrific Saturday-afternoon swashbucklers ""The Mask of Zorro"" and ""The Legend of Zorro."" Over the past 20 years or so the Bond movies have become increasingly encumbered by big explosions and noisy effects at the expense of clever stunts and often wit. But Campbell brings to ""Casino Royale"" a clear love and respect for pure action There are a few explosions here and there but the action sequences really dominate. And if this is one of the darkest Bond movies ever made -- were meeting Bond near the beginning of his career just after hes been promoted to double-0 status and hes clearly having trouble putting his thuggish instincts to use in international espionage -- its also one of the funniest. (This is a Bond picture in which 007 can joke about chocolate as well as martinis.) The pictures violence is at times brutal but it always has the appropriate weight Its neither frivolous nor excessively heavy-spirited. ""Casino Royale"" opens with a major cockup on Bonds part The freshly minted double-0 undercover in Madagascar goes after and kills an ace bomb maker named Mollaka even though hes been instructed to keep the man alive. (Mollaka is played by Sebastien Foucan one of the inventors of Parkour or ""free-running"" a style of moving at top speeds -- on foot -- that involves bouncing off obstacles and barriers. The chase scene between Mollaka and Bond takes place at a construction site thats conveniently littered with myriad obstacles and barriers and its exhilarating to watch. It also features a great deal of rare and refreshing hand-to-hand combat as opposed to the usual gunplay.) Bonds supervisor the imperious mite M (once again played by the marvelously intimidating Judi Dench) greatly displeased with the man shes just promoted warns him that hell need to cool his hotheadedness prefacing her lecture with the words ""This may be too much for a blunt instrument to understand."" This Bond is a blunt instrument a bruiser whos not afraid of getting bruised so ready to act that he doesnt always think before doing so. And so M cautiously sends him off on his mission which involves sleek metal suitcases stuffed with money deadly international terrorists and a creepy clammy villain le Chiffre (played by the Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen) who because of a malfunctioning tear duct cries tears of blood like a miracle Virgin. He also plays a mean game of Texas Hold em. Much of the out-and-out action in ""Casino Royale"" -- the sharply paced chases and shootouts -- takes place in the first two-thirds of the picture which is rarely dull even for an instant. (The cinematographer Phil Meheux shoots the action and the exotic locales with brisk clarity.) Even so the movie clicks into high gear -- and subtly sharpens its focus -- when Bond puts on a tuxedo for the first time. In the early part of ""Casino Royale"" this greenhorn Bond wears serviceable undercover clothes comfortable but unremarkable trousers and short-sleeved shirts that stretch -- barely -- over his considerable biceps. But when it comes time to meet his nemesis across the card table at the casino (supposedly located in Montenegro although this part of the movie was filmed in a spa town in the Czech Republic) the tuxedo he puts on isnt the one hes brought with him It has been chosen for him by a woman hes just met Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) a reluctant assistant on his mission. Vesper is the government beauty whos been called in to keep an eye on the money that Bond will be using at the card tables which of course belongs to Bonds employer the Crown. Vesper has to pose as Bonds girlfriend a task that displeases her greatly since shes already been turned off by his arrogance. When he protests that he has his own tuxedo and then notes that the new one has already been tailored to his exact measurements Vesper remarks that she sized him up on their first meeting -- in all ways shes already taken his measure. You Might Also Like Green -- first seen in Bernardo Bertoluccis sorely underrated ""The Dreamers"" -- and Craig are a glorious pairing; their scenes together have the best kind of romantic-comedy crackle. Vesper -- Bond has a great time teasing her about her name -- is one of the few Bond Girls to have a well-defined character a template that gives her plenty of shadow and light to work with. (The writers here Neal Purvis and Robert Wade working with Paul Haggis have done right by all the major characters.) Green with her bisque complexion and midnight hair is obviously stunning to look at but she also brings shades of cool gravity and vulnerability to her character that feel wholly natural. She stands up in 4-inch heels to this very potent Bond matching him step-for-step. Thats essential because this Bond is unlike any other weve seen. The character of James Bond is universally thought of as a sex symbol. But thats different from actually being sexy and none of the movie Bonds -- not even Connery as suavely likable as he is -- have really been about sex. Theyve mostly been about getting it over and over again. (The franchises idea of great sex has more to do with quantity than with quality.) But Craig changes all that. Hes the first truly erotic James Bond a creature whose impulses and desires are alternately predictable and unreadable. This has very little to do with Craigs buffed-up build (those miniature swim trunks notwithstanding) and nearly everything to do with his face His smile is wary as if it had been repurposed from a scowl; his wildflower-blue eyes betray nothing and tell us everything. Craig an actor who has been superb in a broad range of roles in pictures as disparate as ""The Mother"" ""Munich"" and ""Sylvia"" here plays a stereotype the iconic masculine hero with hidden vulnerabilities. But hes a stereotype with wings Theres no holding him down or boxing him in. All Bond movies have some sort of cartoonish lovemaking in them. But actual love scenes are harder to come by in Bond movies and ""Casino Royale"" -- which in some ways resembles another wonderful Bond picture one with unusual emotional depth the 1969 ""On Her Majestys Secret Service"" -- features a great one. To describe it is to spoil it but I will say that its a clever and lovely antidote to the ubiquitous dumb uncomfortable-looking shower-sex scene. Bond and Vesper are fully clothed in this sequence; the erotic charge between them is subtle but intense. The delicacy of this brief moment between them is just one of the things that sets ""Casino Royale"" apart from all other action movies and even apart from many of the previous Bond movies. This at last is Bond stripped bare. Stephanie Zacharek is a senior writer for Salon Arts amp; Entertainment. More Stephanie Zacharek.

This is a utilitarian back-to-basics Bond a ""blunt instrument"" as M (Judi Dench) puts it (echoing Bond author Ian Fleming) stripped of the knowing smirk and salacious wink.Which is not to say Craigs Bond isnt cocky -- thats his designated character flaw -- but the rough edges havent been shaved off yet.""Shaken or stirred?"" inquires a barman.""Do I look like I give a damn?"" Bond shoots back.Its appropriate the vehicle for this relaunch should be Flemings first novel. ""Casino Royale"" was filmed as a spoof in 1967 but its no more inherently ridiculous than any of the others and the (quite faithful) new version leans over backward to play down the series more decadent accoutrements the girls the gadgets and the gizmos (though not alas the product placement).Although bad guy Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) has acquired the baroque habit of crying blood hes a banker looking for profit not a megalomaniac thirsting for world domination.Too bad for him Bond foils a plan to blow up a prototype super-sized airliner at Miami airport (the second of the films big three action set-pieces). After taking a bath at the stock market Le Chiffre organizes a multimillion-dollar private poker tournament to win back his dodgy clients money.The British Treasury stakes Bond to the tune of 10 million but sends Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) along to keep tabs on the taxpayers investment. Given Le Chiffres glaringly obvious ""tell"" it seems like a good bet.And speaking of tells theres no way of knowing for sure which parts of the script belong to Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (veterans of the last two Brosnan Bonds) and which were glossed by the seemingly ubiquitous Paul Haggis (""Crash"" ""Million Dollar Baby"") but the old-school romantic sparring between Vesper and Bond has the double Oscar winners fingerprints all over it both for the gallant stab at sophisticated repartee and the earnest attempts to invest these fantasy figures with psychological depth.He even pokes around for some vestige of dormant humanity in the disquietingly professional killer.This Bond bleeds and bruises though he also gives as good as he gets. Then he goes sappy on us -- another lesson to be learned over time (144 minutes of it). In this fourth act the movie finally overplays its hand.Despite Greens spirited performance the plot stops dead in its tracks for a spot of lethargic and unconvincing R amp; R. When the expected twist finally arrives the climactic showdown in a Venetian townhouse doesnt muster the emotional wallop exacted by ""On Her Majestys Secret Service"" in similar circumstances.Still theres clearly life in the old dog yet. Bond may or may not be relevant in the New World Disorder but against all odds he remains a potent figure.Consider As usual the filmmakers serve their best up front. Its a high-wire chase scene starting in a construction site and ending with a shoot-em-up in an (unnamed) embassy. The bit is an uproarious demonstration of sheer reckless endeavor. No introductions are necessary. Who else could it be?""Casino Royale"" runs 144 minutes and is rated PG-13. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

"Casino Royale | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; casino-royale_769 ) Casino Royale (United States/United Kingdom/Czech Republic 2006) A movie review by James Berardinelli When Pierce Brosnan took over the role of James Bond for Goldeneye much was made about how the franchise was being ""modernized."" In reality the only apparent changes were cosmetic. Brosnans 007 was easily connected to the character previously played by Sean Connery George Lazenby Roger Moore and Timothy Dalton. With the ascension of Daniel Craig to the gun tux martini and license to kill seismic changes have occurred. This is no longer the James Bond we know from the 60s 70s 80s and 90s. Welcome to the new world of MI6s most storied agent. The purpose of Casino Royale is to ""re-boot"" the franchise. Craig isnt succeeding Brosnan; hes re-inventing the role. As far as this movie is concerned nothing in the previous 20 entries has happened. This is Bonds ""origin"" story and the only thin bit of continuity is Judi Denchs return as Madam M. Forget everything you think you know about 007. For years now the Bond formula has been drowning in a sea of rip-offs and pretenders each more over-the-top than its predecessor. In order to retain a market niche the Bond franchise had to strike out in a different direction - something less cartoonish and closer to the Ian Fleming source novels. Its impossible to say where the filmmakers will take Bond from here but Casino Royale hints that it may be in a more down-to-earth direction than were accustomed to. Whats missing? Quite a bit actually. Until its rousing introduction during the end credits the ""James Bond Theme"" is heard sparingly during brief subdued passages. The signature line of ""Bond James Bond"" keeps us waiting. There are no gadgets - in fact theres no Q. Nor is there any Moneypenny. Theres action but its surprisingly low-key (at least for Bond). Absent are the over-the-top gravity-defying stunts that have characterized 007 movies over the years. This time things get brutal. Not only is there a nasty fight in which Bond beats the crap out of a bad guy (he has to kill two people to get his double-zero status but the deaths dont have to be neat) but our hero ends up on the receiving end of some vicious treatment. One cant imagine Connery Dalton or especially Moore going through that ordeal. The plot follows Flemings story a lot more closely than the original Casino Royale (a pathetic and uneven spoof) did. Its early days for Bond. Having completed the requirements for graduation to the elite level he has been assigned 007 although M is convinced hes not ready. His first assignment is to track down one of the most elusive worldwide suppliers of terrorist money. After following the clues which first take him to the Bahamas then to Miami Bond learns the identity of his quarry Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) whos about to enter an exclusive poker game at Casino Royale in Montenegro. Bankrolled by MI6 Bond enters against Le Chiffre with accountant Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) watching the money. As the action at the tables heats up Bond finds himself in trouble away from them as Le Chiffre and some of his associates try to eliminate the British agent. It has been a long time since Bond has been this human. Not since On Her Majestys Secret Service - the last time he fell in love - have we seen this side of the super agent. Its s curious thing to see Bond develop deep feelings for Vesper. Were used to him treating women like disposable commodities. Oh he has affection for them but love is not in his vocabulary. Yet theres no better way to humanize a superhero than to make him fall in love. We have seen that with Superman and Spider-Man. Now we see it with 007. This aspect of the movie is one reason why Casino Royale is a cut above anything we have gotten from the Bondmakers in decades. The plot is oddly constructed and plays out in three clearly defined acts. The first is the most like a traditional Bond film with James hopping from country to country engaging in a meaningless romance (with Caterina Murino) and chasing after two henchmen (a foot chase that involves scaffolding and a rush to stop a bomb at Miami Airport). Act II takes place mainly at the poker table. Surprisingly theres a lot of tension even though theres not much action (except a staircase fracas) and the movie uses this segment to build the romantic tension between Vesper and Bond. I wont say much about the third act except that it goes some unexpected places and initially seems disconnected with what precedes it. For Daniel Craig this is a triumphant debut. Not since early Connery have we seen a Bond this magnetic. Craig manages to show us both the human and the inhuman sides of Bond and the portrayal is free of fatuousness. This Bond isnt beyond uttering the occasional quip but when he does so theres not a lot of humor in the delivery. Not since the closing moments of On Her Majestys Secret Service have we seen such a vulnerable 007. While theres always a certain sadness associated with waving goodbye to a departing actor Craigs performance makes us ask ""Pierce Who?"" With everything else changing one wonders whether it might have been time to bring someone else in to play M. Thats not a knock on Judi Dench - no one can deliver Ms acerbic one-liners like her - but if the intent is to make a clean break why is she here? Eva Green still best known for taking off her clothing in Bernardo Bertoluccis The Dreamers is the right mix of hard and soft as Vesper - its not hard to see how she could beguile Bond. Mads Mikkelsen is intense enough to pull off the villain role even though he lacks the megalomaniacal bent evidenced by most Bond bad guys. Additional support comes from Giancarlo Giannini as Mathis the British agent based in Montenegro and Jeffrey Wright as old friend Felix Leiter. Its interesting to note that the radical revising of Bond is being done by the ""usual"" team. Its not as if an entirely new group was brought in for the ""re-boot."" The producers continue to be Michael G. Wilson and Barbara (daughter of Cubby) Broccoli. The writers are Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with an assist from Paul ""hes everywhere these days"" Haggis) who were involved in scripting the last two Brosnan movies. Director Martin Campbell oversaw Goldeneye with Phil Meheux as his cinematographer. And David Arnold has been composing Bond scores since he took over from John Barry in the 90s. (The title song ""You Know My Name"" which Arnold co-wrote with Chris Cornell sounds eerily like something by Barry.) My hope is that Casino Royale has not only re-invented James Bond but made him relevant for the 21st century. The target audience has shifted. Although theres nothing in Casino Royale that will exclude teenagers this 007 is aimed squarely at adults. The November release date is also perfect - the film is almost too dark and serious for the kind of lighthearted mindless fun we associate with summer blockbusters. In recent years I have come to each new James Bond movie with a series of ingrained expectations. For the most part the Brosnan films met them across the board. Casino Royale defies many of them and I couldnt be happier.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The most significant shot in Casino Royale--the latest revamp of the James Bond franchise--comes early while new Bond Daniel Craig is getting his Parkour on and hopping from beam to beam at a construction site in pursuit of a terrorist bomber. When Craig severs a cable so he can rise up on a pulley theres an insignificant insert shot of the pipes Craig cut loose now tumbling on the ground. But its only insignificant from a plot perspective. From a thematic perspective the falling pipes reflect the mission statement for this new Bond ""Actions have consequences."" This is a messier Bond than weve seen in a while. Hes impulsive he miscalculates and when he kills someone he gets blood on his hands his face and all over his clothes. In Casino Royale 007 has plenty of chances to get bloody. While doing an unauthorized investigation of a terror network Craig makes contact with its chief financier Mads Mikkelsen whos on the verge of getting snuffed out by his clients after losing a pile of their money. Mikkelsen plans to win it all back at a high-stakes poker game and Craig buys in using money vouched for by Eva Green an agent of the British treasury. In typical Bond fashion Craig works at cracking Greens icy facade while simultaneously angling to ruin Mikkelsen at the card table. In decidedly un-Bond fashion the plot then takes a couple of shocking turns one of which leads to Craig being tied naked to a chair while Mikkelsen whomps him in the scrotum with a stout rope. (Oh for the days of shark tanks and slow-burning lasers.) Craig is fine as Bond though hes better at playing stony and tough than he is at making wisecracks and wooing women. Hes also a little adrift in this overthought reconceptualization which positions Casino Royale as the secret agents first adventure and tries to shoehorn in pieces of well-known Bond mythology (the car the cocktails) as though they were popping up naturally for the first time. And while veteran Bond director Martin Campbell brings character-building purpose to the stripped-down stunt-driven action sequences he cant do anything about the typically superfluous plot and routine climax. In its overt attempts to balance high-spirited spy adventure with more realistic acting and action--conveying the realities of government-sponsored murder--Casino Royale is a step in the right direction for the Bond franchise. But its a small tentative step. Share Tweet Filed Under Film More Movie Review Previous Movie Review Unknown Next Movie Review The Aura Dont miss a story--follow The A.V. Club on Cant see comments?

Columbia Pictures Lets cut to the crucial question How is the new girl in David Finchers version of ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo""? Shes fine thank you very much. That is to say Rooney Mara looks just as bizarre as Noomi Rapace did in the role of Lisbeth Salander the poster girl for punk and spunk in the Swedish-language trilogy. And she cuts just as striking a figure riding a motorcycle surfing the web or taking and giving terrible punishment. But theres a crucial difference. Lisbeth 1 was black-light incandescence burning with focused anger. Lisbeth 2 is recessive haunted sometimes bummed and occasionally blank but clearly alienated from the vile world in which Lisbeth 1 fiercely claimed her place. That may leave fans of the original feeling alienated too not only from Lisbeth but from the spectacle of a remake that has much to recommend it--high-end craftsmanship a singular heroine a labyrinthine mystery an intriguing milieu--yet lacks a vital spark. Fans of the original are not to be sure the remakes main target audience. Americans dont turn out in massive numbers for foreign-language films even when theyre as popular as this one was. So theres plenty of pent-up curiosity about Lisbeth one of the most original figures in movie history as well as standing demand for well-made thrillers of which this is one. (Steven Zaillian adapted the screenplay from the Stieg Larsson novel. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross did the powerful score.) Watch a clip from the film ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" based on the best selling novel and directed by David Fincher. Video courtesy Columbia Pictures. ""The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"" is a sharp departure from Mr. Finchers previous film ""The Social Network"" in the preface of which Ms. Maras Erica fought a spirited verbal duel with Jesse Eisenbergs Mark. The new films plot centers on an antisocial network a Swedish family with a history of Fascist leanings that holds the secret to the fate of a young woman who disappeared 40 years ago. Daniel Craig is Mikael Blomkvist the disgraced journalist who teams up with Lisbeth to investigate the extremely cold case and uncovers more corruption than either of them bargained for. A cool actor turned chilly in the Scandinavian winter Mr. Craig nonetheless finds welcome humor in Mikaels impassive affect. Christopher Plummer is the familys smoothly expansive plutocrat. Stellan Skarsgard puts another construction on smoothness as one of its least savory members. Yet the film is no departure at all from such earlier Fincher films as ""Seven"" and ""Zodiac"" since it involves as they did acts of ghastly violence committed under grisly circumstances. Jeff Cronenweths cinematography does lustrous variations on the darkness the director favors; Stockholm glitters in nighttime exteriors and its subway shines in a spectacular spasm of action involving a backpack. One script change warrants discussion--I wont discuss it because I wont divulge it--but most of the film follows the original sometimes shot for shot. Its certainly worth seeing if you missed the original. If you saw it however theres no way of unseeing it and nothing in the new one to top it. The Adventures of Tintin Watch a clip from the new animated feature ""The Adventures of Tintin"" directed by Steven Spielberg. Video courtesy Paramount Pictures. Its easy to see what the boy in Steven Spielberg saw in the Belgian comic books that led to this 3-D animated action adventure--a boy reporter in a simpler era throwing himself into globe-girdling exploits. Spielberg the man seized on the Herge series which ran from 1929 to 1983 as a chance to work with animation for the first time. (And to join forces with another Herge fan Peter Jackson who served as producer.) What the two filmmakers plus a small army of artists and technicians have wrought of these tales is appealingly earnest at first and charmingly innocent of the glib hip that pollutes so many cartoon features. The motion-capture animation is spectacular a float planes crash landing on a desert; motorcyclists on a wild chase after a falcon in flight; a dam break; a flood; dueling cargo cranes dueling duelists. Yet the action grows wearisome as it grinds on and the film becomes a succession of dazzling set pieces devoid of simple feelings. ENLARGE Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and Tintin (Jamie Bell) in The Adventures of Tintin. Paramount Pictures Jamie Bell is the voice of Tintin a swoop-haired youngster of indeterminate age who is always accompanied by his dog Snowy. Andy Serkis is Captain Haddock Tintins boozy companion on a treasure hunt for a sunken ship. Daniel Craig free of Mikael Blomkvists restraint is the extravagantly vocal villain Sakharine. ""The Adventures of Tintin"" has opened in the U.S. without a huge marketing push after debuting in Europe where the comic books have long been popular and where the film has been doing big business. It will be fascinating to see whether audiences here respond to its curious mix of old-fashioned hero and new-fangled technology. A preteen girl sitting next to me at a screening was literally leaping out of her seat during the action sequences but her parents may have been studio executives. Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close ENLARGE Max von Sydow and Thomas Horn in Extremely Loud amp; Incredibly Close. Warner Bros. Pictures Ive heard people say they werent sure even a decade after Sept. 11 if they could handle this film about a boy whose beloved father has recently died in one of the twin towers. I know what they mean. Almost half a century after Dallas I still have trouble watching film of President Kennedys assassination. Yet Stephen Daldrys screen version of the Jonathan Safran Foer novel adapted by Eric Roth proves hard to handle for other reasons. The productions penchant for contrivance is insufferable--not a single spontaneous moment from start to finish--and the boy is so precocious you want to strangle him. Its surely not the fault of Thomas Horn the remarkable young man who plays him. In widely seen clips from his winning appearance on ""Teen Jeopardy"" Thomas was thoughtful articulate and poised beyond his years. That must have made him seem like a natural for the role of Oskar Schell who may or may not have Aspergers syndrome and who outdoes any of J.D. Salingers gifted kids in richness of vocabulary and complexity of ideas. Watch a clip from the film ""Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close"" starring Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock. Video courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures. But Oskar in print is one thing. As you read the book (which I also disliked) you are tracking at your own pace the workings of the boys mind--and the pain in his heart--as he searches New York City for a lock that matches a key his father has left behind. Its quite another thing to watch Oskar on the screen with no respite from his shrill voice or his mannered behavior. A less remarkable actor--or Thomas himself directed for simplicity--might have taken the curse off the movies case of the terminal cutes. Mr. Daldry however chose to push his young star in the opposite direction toward a totality of artifice that dilutes the impact of Sept. 11 and underscores the blissed-out illogic of Oskars quest. Sandra Bullock is Oskars griefstruck mother Linda and Tom Hanks is his father Thomas. In flashbacks father and son express their special relationship with such relentlessly abstruse conversations that you long for one or the other to say something like ""Lets have scrambled eggs."" Max von Sydow gives a lively performance as The Renter a mysterious mute. In another film his silence might be golden. In this one it goes platinum. Watch a clip from the new film ""We Bought a Zoo"" starring Matt Damon. We Bought a Zoo Matt Damon stars in and gracefully carries Cameron Crowes family film about a widower who gives his two kids a new life by buying a rural house that comes with a zoo. Its really an achievement when you stop to think of it for Mr. Damon to switch from tough-as-nails Jason Bourne to tender-hearted Benjamin Mee but he makes the transition look effortless. A good thing too because the production has been constructed effortfully from notions and elements that hang together fairly loosely. ENLARGE Matt Damon in We Bought a Zoo. Twentieth Century Fox The zoo and its animals seldom transcend the status of props; its hardly helpful when Benjamin notes that ""the sellers say you dont even need any special knowledge to run a zoo; what you need is a lot of heart."" Dont tell that to the animal-rights people whove been calling attention to the foolish line and dont expect to be overly impressed by the expertise of Kelly the zookeeper who is played by Scarlett Johansson. (Or by her performance which at times seems uncertain.) What holds the film together is its genuine sense of family--Benjamins daughter is played delightfully by Maggie Elizabeth Jones and his son by Colin Ford--and Mr. Damons portrayal of a loving father moving beyond the grief of losing his wife. ""We Bought a Zoo"" is a movie you want to like and a movie you can enjoy if you cut its slackness some slack. DVD Focus ENLARGE Casino Royale (2006) Daniel Craig isnt just acceptable but formidable as a newly minted James Bond. Hes at least the equal of the best ones before him and beats all of them in sheer intensity. The English star (he became one as soon as the movie opened) makes physicality exciting emotional detachment interesting and stirrings of tenderness affecting. This chapter of the Bond saga set forth as a prequel was directed by Martin Campbell. Mads Mikkelsen is the villainous banker Le Chiffre. Eva Green is Vesper Lynd a lissome British treasury official and emotional chameleon. The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) Matt Damon gives a remarkable performance as the mild-mannered bespectacled and murderous Tom Ripley. The year is 1958 and the place is Italy where rich young Americans play expatriate games aboard yachts on azure seas or dart through ancient hill towns on sputtering Vespas and Lambrettas. But Tom who is poor cant acknowledge his hearts true desire to Jude Laws fragrantly decadent playboy Dickie Greenleaf. Tom yearns to be Dickie Greenleaf and he will be before the end of this lush if overlong thriller which the late Anthony Minghella directed from his adaptation of Patricia Highsmiths novel. Billy Elliot (2000) Stephen Daldrys debut feature is a piece of flagrant feelgoodism thats saved by a Bell--Jamie Bell in the title role. Elevenyear-old Billy was born to dance. More remarkably for a working-class child born to dance classical ballet though he doesnt know it until he goes to his weekly boxing lesson and comes upon a ballet class in the same building. His dancing teacher is played by the splendid Julie Walters and its nice to see the two working off one another the cigarette-smoking dame and the impish slip of a boy with a shining future Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Obama Trump Is Just Offering Slogans and Fear RNC vs. DNC Sizing Up the Conventions Obama Ends DNC Speech Im Ready to Pass the Baton Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillarys One-Candidate Race Opinion A Disunited Partys Successful Convention GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% The Olympic Fantasy Confronts Reality Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

The latest James Bond installment has less campy flavor and more pulse-stopping action (a la The Bourne Identity). It also sets the scene for Bonds evolution from a cocky brute into the sophisticated and suave spy we know and love. Though Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan distinguished themselves in previous movies Daniel Craig has made Bond his own. His portrayal feels grittier and more complex than previous 007s. This is also partly the result of a better script by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Oscar winner Paul Haggis as well as top-notch directing by Martin Campbell (GoldenEye). Craig brings a sadistic edge and intensity to the role -- along with a wondrously chiseled physique. He also has a vulnerability and dark wit. His piercing blue eyes project a steely resolve and cool toughness. We believe he could kill mercilessly in a way that perhaps the more dashing Brosnan might not have persuaded us. Craigs Bond is arrogant to the point of blundering which makes him a bit more human. The action in the film also tops previous Bonds. The opening is a riveting dialogue-free 20-minute foot chase between Bond and an African bombmaker with super-human agility. Craig is thoroughly convincing physically in athletic sequences. Here the action focuses more on human stunts than explosions. A chase involving an airport bomber and Bond atop his truck is more about the characters than the firepower. Action sequences are leavened by an evolving romance between Bond and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). The film is about a half hour too long. The third act drags and an extended high-stakes poker game doesnt always keep our attention. But this is a superior Bond. Craig has signed on for more Bond action which is good news. His menacing but human interpretation of the spy adds an intriguing dimension to the role and has reignited a rather tired and predictable series.

"No joke our latest 007 is a humorless efficient killer - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Bond No joke our latest 007 is a humorless efficient killermoviesNovember 17 2006|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticBond is back and this time hes scary.Daniel Craig takes over the role Sean Connery George Lazenby Roger Moore Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan had before him in Casino Royale. Craig gives us a virile athletic dangerous amoral spy a guy fond of other mens wives and a killer unafraid of killing.Hes also humorless. The guy couldnt tell a joke or manage a quip to save his Aston-Martin. So they dont give him many. No ""Q"" no real gadgets to brag about. This is a serious bloody-minded Bond for a serious age. Hes not droll witty or even particularly British.The chases are more visceral the fights more personal in Casino Royale which isnt even remotely a remake of that 1967 farce starring Peter Sellers and David Niven. This is an updating of Ian Flemings 1953 introductory Bond novel and Martin Campbells film is an attempt at reinventing the character and the franchise.Shot more arrestingly than most Bond films -- a striking blue-gray and white opening makes one wonder for a minute if theyll have the nerve to render the antiquated Bond in a period piece -- featuring one of the best chases the series has ever had its still a movie built around a card game.And that friends is a problem. Casino Royale is just swell when Bond is busting up bathrooms in Prague busting up embassies in Madagascar and busting a move in Nassau. But when he gets to well Casino Royale (here in the former Yugoslav Republic of Montenegro) the film goes utterly flat.The villain is a gambling ""banker"" for international terrorists (he calls them ""freedom fighters""). Le Chiffre (""the cipher"") has the puffy lips and glistening sweaty skin and oiled-down hair of a B-movie Nazi. Hes also an asthmatic who occasionally bleeds out of one of his scarred tear-ducts. Not good for your poker face.And thats important. Because the game is no longer that exotic card contest of the super-rich baccarat. Its Texas hold em. How common.Mads Mikkelsen (Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself) doesnt embody the classic Bond villain in that hes not larger than life. The classic ""Bond girl"" is Eva Green (Kingdom of Heaven) an intoxicating beauty with little screen presence. Shes a government banker-liaison who comes to the casino with Bond to bankroll him in a 10 million entry game which it is hoped will bring the roof down on Le Chiffre and his whole terrorist layaway plan.The cute stuff here is the odd reference to a classic 1964 Aston-Martin; a ""Money"" and ""Penny"" joke because Miss Moneypenny is not included; Bonds discovery of the cool way to say his name; the cool drink to order ""shaken not stirred""; and his first meeting with his CIA counterpart (Jeffrey Wright is Felix Leiter).Craigs Bond occasionally lets us see the human being behind the gun. But really here its ""Bring on the sado-masochism Mr. Bond"" as Craig (Layer Cake Munich) dishes it out. And takes it.Its not as bad as Die Another Day and not up to the jolly mayhem of the best films in the series. Casino Royale is an overlong movie making an overdue move in a promising Bourne Identity direction. Most important its good enough to ensure that Mr. Bond will be in the game for at least one more hand.

Directed by Goldeneyes Martin Campbell the film offers a creation myth based on Ian Flemings novel which was the first in the Bond series and the only one not originally acquired by Cubby Broccoli. (A so-bad-its-bad spoof was released by rival producers in 1967). But this isnt just business as usual for 007. Hes a far cry from the swizzle-stick spy who vanquished foe and femme in 20 official movies over 46 years. He is youve no doubt noticed blond. Daniel Craigs casting sparked some outrage among fans more concerned with Double 0s melanin than his murderous skill set as though blue eyes might desecrate the holy temple of Bond. People get a grip. Craigs performance categorically silences the naysayers igniting the film with a combustible half-cocked virility that the series hasnt seen since the Sean Connery era. But even Connery -- a bluff Scots bodybuilder before he donned the tux -- never convinced as a killer. Theres never been anything verite about the movies body count or their antiheroic star assassin. There is now. Maybe its an echo from his roles in Munich and Infamous but Craig makes one bloomin scary Bond I would not want to get on his bad side. He uses his license to liquidate repeatedly and decisively and he isnt all that stylized about it either; hes bloody and mean. The gist of the story involves Bonds first case as 007 some straightforward business about a fellow who plays bank to terrorists. The fellow (Mads Mikkelsen) has a scarred left eye that cries blood but his primary weakness is a tendency to use his clients money to play the stock market. Jolly for him until he drops more than 100 million a loss that compels him to join a high-stakes hold em game in Montenegro. Guess who joins in? The game scenes I must warn you go on and on. The movie does too (its the longest Bond yet) but its muscular lead and bare-knuckle approach lend a rippling illusion of tautness. This new hard 007 has a paucity of gizmos -- no Q -- and a woman that the sly devil genuinely falls for hard. Played by Eva Green (Kingdom of Heaven) like the smart chick slumming it with a jock this early-model Bond girl goes a long way toward explaining James eventual transformation into cold-hearted himbo. Other emblematic tendencies are also explained which made me wonder whether Craig will cool off as the series progresses. Not too much I hope. I like this hot rough diamond and Id hate to see him become the cubic zirconia of Roger Moore. The one element lacking in Craigs performance -- one that Pierce Brosnan absolutely nailed -- is playfulness and I wouldnt mind if he found some before the next films made. But creation myths can be deadly serious and this one has Bond naked and tortured and darn-near emasculated before times up. (This is PG-13 ... why exactly?) ""You do what I do for too long there wont be enough of a soul to salvage"" he says waxing poetic. I say Go ahead and do it Mr. Bond.

Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 17 2006 1200AM EST Last updated Tuesday Mar. 17 2009 114PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Casino Royale Directed by Martin Campbell Written by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Paul Haggis Starring Daniel Craig Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen Classification PG Rating  The first response to the new brutal and blunt James Bond movie Casino Royale is to breathe a sigh of relief Now this is more like it. The creators of the 21st Bond have set the franchise back to zero and Ian Flemings original creation to strip down and reconstruct a series that is a financial juggernaut but also had become a smarmy bloated mess. The masterstroke was casting Daniel Craig in whom the producers finally have a Bond worthy of the Sean Connery hairy mantle. By comparison Roger Moore was a supercilious headwaiter and Pierce Brosnan a Zoolander-like male model. Craig blond with hooded steely eyes has a face like the end of a hammer and the body of a boxer who has just punched out a rich guy and stolen his tuxedo. Gone are most of the increasingly ridiculous gadgets (the invisible car of Die Another Day). This Bond bleeds grunts and wrestles; he drowns an enemy in a sink and tosses another down a stairwell. Most of the action is set not behind a wheel or on a ski slope but in run-on battles through dirty construction sites and industrial wastelands. This decision by director Martin Campbell ( GoldenEye) and his writers (Neal Purvis Robert Wade Paul Haggis) to tilt Bond more toward Get Carter brutishness rather than To Catch a Thief charm is a calculated risk -- nobody would call Craig ""suave."" But the payoff is the revitalization of Bond by making him closer to what Fleming envisaged a sociopath who fortunately is on our side. Casino Royale published in 1953 was the first Bond novel introducing the British agent with the story of a high-stakes card game against a Cold War backdrop. Though updated the new script stays essentially faithful to the novel with a token nod to the earlier time period A film-noir-style black-and-white opening sequence sees Bond in Prague notching his first two kills thus earning his double-0 status. After changing to colour for the odd opening credits (Tarot cards animation and what appears to be Victorian Oriental-themed wallpaper set to the forgettable Chris Cornell theme song You Know My Name) the action begins to blister. First stop an African village where a mongoose-and-cobra fight is in progress soon followed by another one between Bond and a potential bomber. The first chase scene features spectacular stunt work taking its lead from such bleeding-edge movies as the French District 13 with its displays of parkour or ""free running"" and the choppy hand-and-foot action of the Thai Ong-bak. Heres a Bond film where the action looks contemporary. The novice Bond is also a bit of a bumbler. After blowing up an embassy he finds himself in disgrace. His boss M (Judi Dench) wants him to disappear but Bond who is on the hunt for terrorist financier Le Chiffre decides to pursue the case alone. That leads him to the Bahamas and then Miami. Theres a scene at a thematically astute Bodyworks display (the new Bond is a whole lot more about death than glamour) and another action sequence on an airport runway before finally the film heads to Europe for his poker-playing centrepiece. The archenemy Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen) is an accounting nerd with a bloody weepy eye and an asthma puffer and an arrogance about his gambling prowess. Hes trying to recover a fortune he lost by betting on the stock market according to his insider knowledge of coming terrorist attacks. Back in Ms good graces Bond is set up to gamble against Le Chiffre in hopes of bankrupting him and forcing him to turn himself in to British intelligence. Along for the ride is the latest but decidedly different Bond girl Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) a treasury department official ready to front Bond his needed 10-million. Green -- chalky white with red lips and vampirish eye shadow-- is much more a forties femme fatale than a Bond bunny. As the script makes clear shes a real threat -- someone capable of penetrating the heros ""armour"" and causing him to give up his profession barely before hes started it. One can feel the influence of Oscar-winning screenwriter Haggis ( Million Dollar Baby Crash) with his fascination of inner pain as a motivator Gosh these smart-talking physically perfect hyper-calculating wisecrackers seem kind of lonely. A celebratory dinner between Bond and Lynd in an empty casino dining room is like a rich-folks Lady and the Tramp without the spaghetti strand. We learn that both are orphans ""mal-adapted"" and restlessly ambitious for things they cant quite articulate. The card game proves unexpectedly exciting in ways that have little to do with the arcana of poker betting and the 100-million pot. (For us novices the script provides a running commentary from Giancarlo Giannini as the agent Mathis as he explains the game to Lynd.) Almost every time Bond leaves the table for a break someone tries to murder him. Thank goodness Bonds Aston Martin comes equipped with a defibrillator in the glove compartment. Again true to the detective tradition in its Raymond Chandler form the hero must be knocked unconscious and have his ego dismantled before he can regroup and focus on his righteous purpose. The key sequence here involves the most kinky scene in a mainstream movie since Pulp Fiction involving a wicker chair with the bottom cut out nudity and a rope with a terribly big knot. So far images like those from the Abu Ghraib prison have only been echoed in cultishly perverse movies such as Saw and Hostel; once again the new Bond is on the bleeding edge. Running at 144 minutes Casino Royale is seriously long with an unwieldy structure that frontloads the action and pads the backend with gambling and romance. The deflation begins at about the two-thirds point when Lynd starts acting clingy and Bond struggles to get ugh introspective. Fortunately theres not too much of that sort of nonsense. By the time weve reached the cliffhanger conclusion were back on track Bond having renewed his licence to kill has his pedal to the metal.

""His last action"" writes Ian Fleming in ""Casino Royale"" the novel that introduced the famed British agent ""was to slip his right hand under the pillow"" and rest it near the butt of his gun. ""Then he slept and with the warmth and humor of his eyes extinguished his features relapsed into a taciturn mask ironical brutal and cold."" Watching ""Casino Royale"" director Martin Campbells satisfying entertainment its easy to imagine that as longtime producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli searched for their new Bond they kept in mind this terse sketch. You dont need a weatherman to tell you the 21st installment in the franchise brings an invigorating chill to the air. His name is Craig ahem Daniel Craig. And as promised his Bond is a rougher bit of business than all but one of the 007s that came before him. Yet like that singular Bond he cleans up nicely. Craig trumped some better-known actors then survived the slings and arrows of many a fan - too blond too this too that - to inhabit this role. And dig in he does. The actor who went from London theater to support roles in studio pictures (""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"") and some fine leads in British indies (""Layer Cake"" and ""Enduring Love"") makes a brute yet canny screen presence. This new Bond is not a pretty boy though something hinting at beautiful emotion can be detected dancing around his tousled face. And this story about a terror financier and the high-stakes poker game that might draw him in puts Craigs physicality through the paces with hard dashes and blunt fistfights. In the first major action sequence Bond is in perspiring pursuit of a bomb-carrying terrorist. The chase was choreographed by parkour - or ""free running"" - co-creator Sebastien Foucan (who plays the would-be bomber). Its an impressive action aria that uses the movement disciplines philosophy of fluid motion to send the two lapping over walls cresting onto the high steel beams of cranes - but without the usual results. He who goes up must come down leap after gravity-teasing leap. Bond blows his cover in a diplomatic compound when at last he blows something up. He also draws unwanted attention to M16 and piques the ire of M (Judi Dench). The head of the British Secret Service isnt yet sold on Bond whose impulses make the agent appear more uh-oh than double-0. His hunt for moneyman Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) takes Bond from the Carribean to Montenegro where the waxy villian hopes to recover money he bet - badly - on an airline industry disaster. Accountant Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) accompanies Bond to the high-stakes game to keep an eye on the sizable sum the government has riding on Bonds skills. A series of pleasing one-upping moments between Bond and Lynd starts on the train to Montenegro and continues as they become roomies. He buys her an evening dress he insists she wear. She does the same presumptious thing - ordering a tailored tux for him. A shot of Bond in profile looking in the mirror speaks with muted elegance of a shuttered soul recognizing hes been found out by another. Though youd be a sentimental fool - or perhaps Giancarlo Gianninis character Mathis - to imagine love wills out over violence and duty. Theres no comic relief from Q coming no amusing flirtations with Moneypenny. They arent here. Neither are they missed. Bonds toys never overwhelm the muscular action. His impossibly foxy Aston Martin comes with a decidely unsexy but handy defibrillator. Bonds tete-a-tete with Le Chiffre makes the shark tank incident in ""Thunderball"" look like childs play. (Hint the baddie cuts the wicker bottom from the seat of a chair before tying a naked Bond to it.) Bond movies at their Sean Connery best were a bracing cocktail of conflicting pleasures. Born in the 1950s the character even when he made it to the big screen was as much a symbol of the status quo as he was a reaction to it. And the question has been does a makeover require a vigorous shake or a mindful stir? At one point Bonds asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred. ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" he says. Perhaps that reply will have to suffice for this first outing. Its not a new beverage - how could it be? - just a tasty one.

"""Casino Royale Bond series pulls an ace in Daniel Craig - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW ""Casino Royale Bond series pulls an ace in Daniel Craig By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 16 2006 Casino Royale Directed by Martin Campbell Written by Neal Purvis Robert Wade Paul Haggis based on the novel by Ian Fleming Starring Daniel Craig Eva Green Mads Mikkelsen Judi Dench At Boston Common Fenway suburbs Running time 144 minutes Rated PG-13 (intense sequences of violent action a scene of torture sexual content and nudity)The new James Bond is quick and muscular and there is nothing remotely camp about him. He doesnt wink; in fact Im not sure he even blinks. Where other men might athletically sail through a narrow window opening during a chase scene he prefers to plow through the wall. Hes a strapping brute -- young untested rough around the edges -- and he is magnificent. Let the purists squawk In Daniel Craig the Bond franchise has finally found a 007 whose cruel charisma rivals that of Sean Connery.Based on the first of Ian Flemings novels ""Casino Royale"" is an origin story and it wants very much to be this years ""Batman Begins"" -- a movie that resets the clock to zero and tells the tale with new and becoming leanness. Were present at the start of things Bond gets his first Aston Martin here is fitted for his first tuxedo briefly considers whether ones martini should be shaken or stirred. (His response is priceless and in keeping with the movies no-nonsense tone).Other ritual aspects of the 007 mythos are missing -- theres no Q with his lethal widgets no Miss Moneypenny no cat-stroking villain contemplating the vaporization of South America by satellite. Frankly ""Casino Royale"" is better off without them. If you miss the old cliches consider whether after 21 Bond films and countless parodies your response is simply Pavlovian.After a brief gritty black-and-white opening in which the young spy earns his two kills and ascends to double-0 status ""Casino Royale"" sets Bond on the trail of a mysterious bombing network. (The film is set in the modern day and while its topical its smart enough to steer clear of politics.) A gasp-inducing action sequence sends the hero after a bomber through the streets and among the construction cranes of the capital city of Madagascar ending in an international incident that proves how much this young man still has to learn.""You need to take your ego out of the equation"" scolds M (Judi Dench) the head of the MI6 British spy agency to the man she calls a ""blunt instrument"" and this film is the story of how James Bond gains gravitas -- how he becomes in essence the man we know from the Fleming novels and early films like ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love.""So while there are ""Bond girls"" and Craigs 007 is appreciative of their bodaciousness theres too much on his plate to ogle and conquer. The Madagascar bombers cellphone leads to a middleman in the Bahamas who leads to an epicene European financier named Le Chiffre (Danish leading man Mads Mikkelsen) who makes his fortune shorting airline stocks after terrorist attacks he helps engineer. Behind Le Chiffre is a shadowy universe of bigger players; for once a Bond movie acknowledges that the real world contains people scarier and grayer than Dr. Evil-style madmen.In an effort to bankrupt Le Chiffre and leave him at the mercy of his associates -- nasty pieces of work like the machete-wielding Ugandan ""freedom fighter"" played by Isaach de Bankole -- MI6 sends Bond and fellow agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green of Bertoluccis ""The Dreamers"") to Montenegro for a high-stakes invitation-only gambling tournament. Bowing to current fashion (and wanting the audience to better follow the bluffing) the producers of ""Casino Royale"" have replaced the Baccarat of the original novel with Texas Hold Em familiar from a thousand cable shows.The gambit works even as it instantly dates the film; the inclusion of a pretty dire rock anthem by Soundgarden/Audioslave leader Chris Cornell over the opening credits is another misstep. The director is Martin Campbell who made the 1995 Bond film ""GoldenEye"" the two recent ""Zorro"" movies and the laughable Angelina Jolie sudser ""Beyond Borders""; in his journeyman hands ""Casino Royale"" is a stylish wholly enjoyable piece of work that lacks the organic zing a visionary director like Christopher Nolan on ""Batman Begins"" can bring to the party.It hardly matters though because Craig is so good. If hes a newcomer to American mass audiences followers of British film know the actor from gangster movies like ""Layer Cake"" and dramas such as ""Enduring Love"" and ""The Mother""; he made an impression as one of the Israeli assassins in ""Munich"" and gave startling life to killer Perry Smith in the recent ""Infamous.""No slight to Connery Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan but theres something to be said for casting an actor of depth and creative daring as Bond. Craig hardly overplays the role but he gives us proof of the young 007s arrogance and immaturity shows him tempered by mistakes and even lets him fall in love with believable reluctance followed by commitment.(Green for her part keeps elegant pace.) Then a few things occur from which the James Bond we know finally emerges wiser harder locked loaded. With barely a sign of strain Craig delivers what we least expected a portrait of the artist as a young spy.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"Agent provocative - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMOVIE REVIEW Agent provocativeDaniel Craig rings true as `Casino Royale shrewdly remakes 007.November 17 2006|Kenneth Turan | Times Staff Writer WHAT becomes a legend most? How do you retool an icon without alienating a fan base that has been loyal for longer than the core movie audience has been alive? What in other words do you do with James Bond?Starting 44 years ago with Sean Connery starring as Agent 007 of the British secret service in ""Dr. No"" the 20 James Bond features have been as predictable in their suave posturings as the shaken-not-stirred martini preference of their protagonist.Now with ""Casino Royale"" the hero with a thousand smirks has been given a shrewd and largely successful attitude adjustment that ups the series reality quotient and provides an opportunity for star Daniel Craig to show a wide audience just how good an actor he is.Of course the Bondmeisters have been too canny to jettison everything about their hero. ""Casino Royale"" retains the series trademarks of beautiful complaisant women in revealing outfits high-tech gadgets and some of the best stunts in the business here orchestrated by director Martin Campbell (""GoldenEye"" ""The Mask of Zorro"") one of the industrys most reliable organizers of chaos.And frankly not all aspects of the remake have been completely successful. Hoping to expand the series largely male demographic reach writers Paul Haggis and the team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have attempted with only partial success to make a Bond romance more real than usual.Plus there is a disturbing torture sequence that makes a mockery out of the films rating. If the words ""intense sequences of violent action a scene of torture sexual content and nudity"" dont exactly sound like the definition of PG-13 to you youre probably not alone.One aspect of the new Bond that works from first minute to last is the most important one and that is Craigs performance. With Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan taking their places as Connerys key successors the Bond franchise has always been fortunate in its choice of leading men and Craig is one of their wisest picks yet.Craig who was Ted Hughes to Gwyneth Paltrows Sylvia Plath in ""Sylvia"" and murderer Perry Smith in ""Infamous"" has both the physicality and presence to make this films more brutal less suave Bond a man who would do anything to get the job done completely persuasive.But while you buy Craigs cocky Bond as implacable and impervious to danger someone who can convincingly say ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" when asked the famous ""shaken or stirred"" vodka martini question you also believe him and this is crucial as a flesh-and-blood human being who can be physically hurt.""Casino Royale"" needs this rougher-edged 007 because this was the first Bond book (previously filmed in a quasi-comic mode with Peter Sellers and David Niven in 1967) that Ian Fleming wrote. Though the plot has been updated to focus (inevitably) on terrorism and a critical card game has been changed from chemin de fer to the less elegant-sounding Texas hold em -- this is still basically the story of how the Bond of then became the Bond everyone knows.After a prologue showing Agent 007s first two kills ""Casino Royale"" moves briskly into the films initial and most breathless (literally and figuratively) stunt. This is an elaborate chase through several crowded construction sites where the prey terrorist Mollaka is played by Sebastien Foucan who is one of the inventors of a dazzling style of movement called parkour or free running. The roughly five-minute sequence took a reported three months to prepare and shoot typical of the kind of attention to production detail that is the hallmark of the series.Not pleased by Bonds cocky not to say reckless demeanor is his boss M (played for the fifth time by the reliable Judi Dench). But her critical comments (""Quite the body count youre stacking up"") cant completely hide a kind of admiration for the mans cheek.Though he stops in the Bahamas for a seduction and in Miami for another breathless stunt (this one involving a giant airplane) Bond keeps on the trail of the deadly and emotionless Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen taking on the role Orson Welles had in 1967) a kind of E.F. Hutton for terrorists who invests the bad guys money at a rate of return the God-fearing can only dream about.The heart of ""Casino Royale"" is set in Montenegro (filming was done in the Czech Republics Karlovy Vary) where Bond involves himself with a 150-million winner-take-all poker game and the beautiful and sassy Vesper Lynd (Eva Green of Bertoluccis ""The Dreamers"") finds the heart under Bonds brusque exterior.Though the films final break-the-bank action sequence in Venice is worth waiting for ""Casino Royales"" 2-hour 24-minute running time is long enough to exhaust all but the series biggest fans.Still the last words on the screen are ones you can take to the bank. ""James Bond"" it says ""will return."" You can bet on it.kenneth.turanlatimes.comMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action a scene of torture sexual content and nudity.

"Daniel Craig The man who would be Bond. Slate Sign In Sign Up Daniel Craig The man who would be Bond. Daniel Craig The man who would be Bond. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 16 2006 756 PM Daniel Craig The man who would be Bond. By Dana Stevens Listen to Dana Stevens Spoiler Special about Casino Royale by clicking the arrow on the player below Daniel Craig in Casino Royale In the International Spy Museum in Washington D.C. theres an item on display called the ""rectal tool kit"" that was the object of a mild stir when the museum opened in 2002. (Pictures of the museum piece are not available online but this image should give you an idea.) Its a metal capsule about 4 inches tall that was issued to CIA spies on dangerous missions in the 1960s. A friend visiting the exhibit defined this object as the deal breaker par excellence for James Bond wannabes Sure you get the international honeys the briefcase of fun gadgets and the tricked-out Aston Martin but you have to go around with a tube full of minipliers up your butt. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Daniel Craig the new Agent 007 in Casino Royale (Columbia Pictures) is the first Bond you can imagine actually availing himself of the rectal tool kit. (Sean Connery? Definitely not placing anything in that area. Pierce Brosnan? I dont even want to think about it.) Craigs Bond would use the tool kit in a pinch because hes hard-core. Less worldly and sophisticated than earlier Bonds Craigs version of the character feels raw dark and dangerous. And its not an ""oh you marvelous rake"" kind of danger but a ""this guy could really hurt me"" kind of danger. Advertisement Upon first hearing in the fall of 2005 that Daniel Craig would be the next James Bond my first response was ""Daniel wha?"" Yet at that point I had already seen and admired Craigs performances in at least three movies The Mother Sylvia and Enduring Love. The problem was that Craig disappears into his roles and I couldnt keep the actors name straight from movie to movie. In an attempt to understand just what about this moody British actor had screamed ""Bond. James Bond"" to producer Barbara Broccoli I recently went on a scouting expedition through some of Craigs recent work. Daniel Craig in Enduring Love If theres one common theme in Craigs madly shape-shifting career its intensity. Even playing a neurasthenic philosophy professor in Enduring Love in 2004 (the film with perhaps the most promising opening sequence of the past five years) he boiled over with physical vitality. You could see why the strangely gentle stalker played by Rhys Ifans labored under the impression that he and Craigs character were meant to be together after their one horrific shared encounter. The movies hasty conventional thriller ending was a disappointment but Craigs brooding introspective performance like Ifans guileless one burst the bounds of the story. Daniel Craig in The Mother Though James Bond is clearly an erotic aggressor Craigs past roles have been more likely to situate him as the object of others desire. In The Mother (2003) his character an unhappily married building contractor is the sexual hot potato who gets tossed back and forth between a daughter (Cathryn Bradshaw) and her sexagenarian mother (Anne Reid). The Mother is a deeply unsettling film not only because of the extended nude love scenes between Craig and Reid but because neither of these two May-December lovers is particularly lovable. But Craigs performance is rich enough that even if you never quite penetrate the mystery of what draws him to this needy older woman you know he has his reasons. Daniel Craig in Sylvia This is not the place to bewail the miscasting of Gwyneth Paltrow as Sylvia Plath in Sylvia (2003) a thoroughly misbegotten biopic of the suicidal poet. But Craigs presence as Plaths husband Ted Hughes elevated the whole endeavor. Reciting rapid-fire lines from Romeos death scene as he courted Plath in a students garret Craig made it clear that what drew Plath to the brilliant but narcissistic Hughes was inseparable from the death wish that would finally do her in. Advertisement In the British heist picture Layer Cake (2004) Craig played a nameless drug dealer referred to in the credits as ""XXXX."" Layer Cake was like Sexy Beast without the good parts. The violence was gratuitous to the point of absurdity and the organized-crime plot was impossible to follow but Craigs character was as fearsome if not as loathsome as Ben Kingsleys Don Logan. Amoral and dandified with a soft spot for the ladies he was the most Bond-like character Craig had played so far. Daniel Craig in Infamous Since being cast as Bond Craig has also played an assassin for the Mossad in Steven Spielbergs Munich (2005). Craig had few lines but a key function He was the devil-may-care foil to Eric Banas more morally tormented hero. More recently he made out with Truman Capote (Toby Jones) in Infamous Douglas McGraths retelling of the story of the writing of In Cold Blood. As convicted murderer Perry Smith Craig was mercurial needy and frightening. Craigs casting at first had some Bond fans up in arms in part because of the color of the actors hair. (Ah blonds. Will their societal oppression never cease?) But it wasnt just the fair hair that seemed wrong to strict constructionists. Bonds have always belonged to a certain physical model suave brunettes with side parts Guy Smiley-types who seem to have been born in a tux. (Hugh Jackman who was rumored to have been one of the candidates to fill the post is a prime example.) Dont get me wrong Craig rocks a fine tuxedo but only because he looks like hes about to burst out of it Incredible Hulk style. In a torture scene Casino Royales blood-weeping villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) visits great indignity upon James Bonds manhood (though to judge from subsequent love scenes in the film no lasting harm is done). As he readies his instruments Le Chiffre compliments the naked and bound superspy on the physique hes about to harm ""Youve taken good care of your body. Such a waste."" The screening audience laughed aloud at this line because Daniel Craigs body is truly something to behold. Hes ripped without being the least bit muscle-bound and possessed of a coiled catlike grace thats atypical for an action star. Like Uma Thurman hes somehow athletic and delicate at the same time. Craigs naked body which is partly if not fully on view in virtually every movie hes made puts me in mind of a great couplet from Ogden Nash ""Should you behold a panther crouch/ Prepare to say ouch."" To tell the truth even those of us with no stake in the creaky Bond franchise had a hard time imagining what a new actor however magnetic could bring to the table. Casting such a protean actor was an odd choice on the filmmakers part. But maybe thats the whole point to subvert the Bond brand. Asked by a bartender if he prefers his martini shaken or stirred Craigs Bond snaps ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" You mightve expected that the 21st century would bring us a post-post-Postmodern Bond so laden with winking references and self-conscious tics that hed sink under his own weight. Instead the director Martin Campbell (who also directed Pierce Brosnans first outing as Bond in Goldeneye) has chosen to give us a Bond whos both metaphorically and literally stripped bare. Let me take this opportunity to thank him for both. SINGLE PAGE 1 2 NEXT Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"An Agent Of Change washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies An Agent Of Change James Bond (Daniel Craig) falls for a British agent played by Eva Green in ""Casino Royale"" the 21st film in the franchise and the first with a blond Bond. (By Jay Maidment -- Columbia Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 17 2006 Nobody does it tougher. Reinventing James Bond as a kind of Navy SEAL with an attitude problem ""Casino Royale"" turns out to be cracking good entertainment as well as a fresh start for the perdurable 21-picture franchise. Daniel Craig kicks major maximus as a Bond whod never use a computer where a punch will do; hes lean and athletic and fast and the movie takes great advantage of his beauty in motion particularly his on-the-dead-run. Besides being the first blond Bond the first Bond under 40 since George Lazenby and the first Bond to look like Steve McQueen hes seemingly the first Bond to actually bleed. His face frequently looks like it had a close encounter with a lawnmower; fights leave him sodden in unpleasant liquids of his own manufacture as well as physically spent and far into oxygen debt. That stands in direct counterpoint to the majority of post-Connery Bonds especially Roger Moore but also toward the end Pierce Brosnan who always seemed such lightweights that you suspected all that hair spray had soaked into their brains and turned them into fashion models. Hmmm you mow down 400 Russian border guards with your trusty AK-47 and you dont even muss your mane? That hair symbolized everything that was wrong with late-issue Bonds Beyond their unbelievability they stood for a figure completely unrooted in any sort of reality. The movies had become almost decadent in their removal of Bond from the physical world He was a kind of male fantasy conceit grown stale and prissy sited amid big dull special effects that were always right up to last years standards. Director Martin Campbells version astutely restores Bond to a real world -- note I say a real world not the real world. This movie is set say one remove from the possible instead of like those last few 20 or so removes. Thus this Bond fights and bleeds and can be tortured but his pain endurance is a fantasy as is his recovery time. He moves like a running back on sinews of steel -- fast evasive believable -- but he makes a few inter-building leaps that ignore the rude physics of gravity. He shoots well (much gun stuff) but it would have been nicer if he missed once in a while. Just once in a while. Yet the movie also has a number of extremely shocking moments -- shocking that is in their tenderness their tragedy their human dimension. The scenes between the cool Craig and Iron Mistress M (the brilliant Judi Dench) really crackle with hostility; did Edward Albee fly in for secret rewrites? Theres a moment where a young British agent is first exposed to the incredible violence of the world shes elected to enter and she collapses in her clothes in the shower. Gently Bond goes and holds her not because hes on the make but because he loves her and knows shes in pain. Later theres a drowning death that has a tragic nightmarish quality a so-close-yet-so-far sensibility that will haunt you just as it haunts Bond. Maybe these human moments exist because the film is derived from Ian Flemings first 007 novel published way back in 1952. It is said by many to be the most ""realistic"" of his books the one in which he was a real novelist as opposed to the later ones where he was sticking to his highly profitable formula. Regardless they do make this Bond slightly human; you care about him as the movie -- essentially a kind of origins piece even though its set in 2006 -- watches the new 00-level promotee find his place in the world his style his voice and possibly even his pathologies. ""Youre not much on empathy are you Bond?"" notes the acidic M. Craig makes you believe in a supremely confident physical animal more athlete really than agent who ultimately turns into a seasoned dependable professional -- without by the way saving the world. The plot in fact is short on saving the world as it is on magic gizmo boxes (okay a big airplane is saved by attaching a magic gizmo box to the terrorist trying to blow it up; but on the other hand a Venetian palazzo sinks into the canals so in a cost-benefit analysis it probably comes out the same). Now about that plot. Hmmm wish I could explain it to you but first Id have to explain it to myself. It makes some sense though a number of the connections were made so fast you more or less have to take them on faith. We open with Bonds first two kills which appear to have nothing to do with the rest of the movie They simply establish tone as one is a fistfight in a mens room so brutal and bloody that it tells you right away youre in a different part of the forest from the boys with the hair spray and the pancake. Then Bonds off to Madagascar to prevent a terrorist attack and the movie gives up one of the best gags in years. Someone has discovered a stuntman named Sebastien Foucan who is given the role of a bomb-carrying bad guy. Once his cover is blown he takes off through the city streets with Bond in pursuit a chase that ultimately ends in (and destroys) a construction project. Its like watching Troy Vincent chase Terrell Owens through a collapsing game of Chutes and Ladders. Foucan is phenomenal To watch him gymnasticize his way across the screens is astonishing. Imagine a human Road Runner beep beep. Hmm by one of those vague connections -- lots of cellphone message-checking seems to be involved -- Bond ends up in the Bahamas then follows a suspect (Im not sure who) to Miami where that suspect gives something (Im not sure what) to a terrorist who is going to blow up Douglass biggest super skybus. The point apparently is to depress airline stock prices at the behest of a terrorist financier named Le Chiffre (Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen) so that after the blasts when airline stocks plummet the terrorists can buy low then sell high. When Bond destroys their moneymaking scheme Le Chiffre is desperate for the money he has lost so he sets up a high-stakes Texas Hold Em tourney in Montenegro. Naturally Bond penetrates as a high-end gambler his mission to win the tourney and break Le Chiffres bank. Now as a man who isnt sure if two of a kind beats a queen and a jack I can say I had some problems following the intense card-playing sequences. The millions of poker fans out there wont and Im guessing theyll see the movie six or more times. During this period it should be added numerous other things are going on Bond falls in love with British agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green fabulous beautiful and intelligent) has a heart attack (induced by drugs) and has a machete fight with two African assassins. Still to come are a car chase a torture sequence (tough but it gives the director another chance to rip Craigs shirt off) that sinking palazzo as well as a final shootout. Half an hour too long (it drags when Bond and Vesper go off on a lark) and with a few too many villains we really cant place in the plot ""Casino Royale"" nevertheless proves that you seldom go wrong if you make a movie that leaves you stirred not shaken. Casino Royale (140 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for violence including a scene of torture as well as sexual content and nudity.

Its one thing for Bond to operate in a dangerous world but a fantasyland?The new film based on Ian Flemings first 007 book gets back to basics and then some. Although the novel has been updated - SMERSH has morphed into a terrorist cartel Chemin de Fer is now Texas hold em poker and so on - its still about how Bond debuted as Bond. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? His first mission pits him against Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) banker to the worlds terrorists. As Bond villains go Le Chiffre is extremely low-key. Youd have to go back to Joseph Wisemans ""Dr. No"" to find a bad guy with so much ice water in his veins. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Youd also have to go back to ""Dr. No"" to see such a cold-blooded Bond. The Connery who played Bond in that film and in ""From Russia With Love"" had a masklike countenance and an edge of cruelty. Craig is even more brutal. Hes feral and takes a grim satisfaction in his body counts.Craig makes you aware of something that the Bond series in its pursuit of steamy sex and cartoon action quickly lost sight of 007 is a killer. Thats what hes licensed to do.I must admit I miss somewhat the old debonair cliches. When Bond Girl Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) the gorgeous Treasury official who delivers Bonds stake in a poker duel with Le Chiffre asks him if he ever minds offing his enemies he responds that he wouldnt be very good at his job if he did. Its a bit of a shock to hear this - kind of like hearing Superman say he enjoys splattering bad guys.Further evidence of a paradigm shift Bond falls in love with the Bond Girl. Whats more she is highly intelligent and never appears with her clothes off. In fact Bond is the one who appears most often in the buff; in one scene which must surely be an in-joke he rises up from the sea like Ursula Andress in ""Dr. No.""The Bond character came of age in a cold war era that for thriller purposes has outlived its usefulness. By bringing ""Casino Royale"" into the age of global terrorism director Martin Campbell and his team risk turning the Bond franchise into a real-world fright show instead of an escape hatch for our action fantasies.There was something comforting about ""Dr. No"" and ""Goldfinger"" and the rest. Their villainy was not of this world. Le Chiffre hits closer to home. Despite his typical Bond villain deformity - when hes nervous his left eye drips tears of blood - hes not really a fun bad guy.I dont mean to make ""Casino Royale"" sound like Dostoevsky. It has its share of thrilling set pieces including its first in the streets of Madagascar where Bond races after a bomber. Its significant that this high-speed scene which utilizes parkour the forward-motion martial art made popular in the French thriller ""District 13"" does not involve any elaborate gadgetry or computer enhancements. Its just one man stalking another.But in the end that man is still Bond - James Bond - and hes all the better for being all too human. Grade B+ Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violent action a scene of torture sexual content and nudity.

Theres a great 100-minute film inside Martin Campbells prolonged movie based on the Ian Fleming novel that started it all. My advice Use the protracted poker match at midpoint as an opportunity to visit the concession stand and catch up on your e-mail.When Sean Connery slipped into Bonds mod serge suit in Dr. No (1962) 007 defined a new kind of masculinity - hard fast and hunky. Much as I enjoyed elements of the subsequent Bonds - Roger Moores winks Timothy Daltons broodings Pierce Brosnans suits - none of them possessed the distinctive mix of macho menace and magnetism that Craig so effortlessly displays.Like Connery - but in different proportions - Craig is earthy and erotic holding himself like a smoking gun. Unlike the no-sweat actor who created 007 Craig reconstructs Bond as inscrutable and vulnerable a secret agent just as likely to wear an untucked shirt as a bespoke suit one who sweats stuff big and small.His eyes are diamond-hard but his heart is soft when it comes to brunette stunner Vesper Lynd (Eva Green from The Dreamers and Kingdom of Heaven). Craig is not your fathers James Bond but he is almost certainly your daughters.Lynd is a treasury officer who finances Bond in a high-stakes poker match in which the mission is to bankrupt Le Chiffre (Danish heartthrob Mads Mikkelsen whose character literally weeps blood from his left eye) financier to international terrorists. Le Chiffre owns the films most quotable line ""I dont believe in God but in a reasonable rate of return.""In a grainy black-and-white prologue we see 007 earn his license to kill. Then the image bleeds to color into a retro-kitsch credits sequence that uses playing-card suits as an overture of the themes to come Spades are bullets emanating from a stylized Glock hearts are tears falling from a throbbing chest.Director Campbell (Vertical Limit Goldeneye) front-loads the action sequences and they are literally breathtaking as Bond runs from Mbale Uganda to Madagascar to Miami to Montenegro and other far-flung places beginning with M. (Speaking of that letter Judi Dench reprises her role as Bonds boss lady and their chemistry is palpable.)Without gadgetry or gags Campbell masterfully choreographs these sequences. The scene where Bond chases a suicide bomber up a steel-framed construction site and down cranes effectively says Take that Spider-Man Take that Bourne Too bad the film loses this momentum in its final act.When Timothy Dalton was crowned Bond in the 1980s he noted diplomatically that half the world thought Connery the best Bond ever and the other half preferred Moore. My guess is that those two camps will agree that Craig is a worthy successor to both.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.Casino Royale  (out of four stars)Produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G.

"Casino Royale | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Casino Royale Print Page Email Page Search Casino Royale (2006; Rated ) B+ "" Nitty gritty dirt Bond."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Casino Royale(2006; PG-13)In theaters Friday 17 November 2006 Summary In his first mission James Bond must stop Le Chiffre a banker to the worlds terrorist organizations from winning a high-stakes poker tournament at Casino Royale in Montenegro. Genre Action Adventure ThrillerDirector Martin CampbellCast Daniel Craig At the outset of ""Casino Royale"" James Bond is just a fledgling agent who doesnt even have a ""double-oh"" classification. To attain ""00"" status one must have registered at least two kills and Bond hasnt eliminated so much as a single adversa- Uh never mind. Bond gets physical and nasty in a gritty black-and-white prologue that announces in no sly fashion this isnt going to be a dated tongue-in-cheek romp featuring a world-weary fiftysomething 007 chomping on a cigar and exchanging single-entendres with some bikini-clad bimbo with a porn star name. This is Ian Flemings Bond a no-nonsense sort who responds to a ""shaken or stirred?"" query from a bartender with a dismissive sneer and a sharp retort ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" Meet the new Bond not the same as the old Bond - and thank God for that. The James Bond franchise is born again in ""Casino Royale "" or should I say Bourne again for Daniel Craigs compactly built coldly efficient stylish killing machine is more reminiscent of Matt Damons Jason Bourne than the middle-aged bounder of a Bond played by Pierce Brosnan and before that Roger Moore. With his boxers nose his chiselled physique and his piercing blue eyes Craig is the most intense and the most athletic of all the Bonds - and perhaps the truest to Flemings original vision. (Im not saying Craig is better than Sean Connery the Babe Ruth of James Bonds. Im just saying hes more real - and more grounded in a somewhat plausible world.) Gone are the silly high-tech gadgets the buxom femme fatales with the flat-line readings and the comic-book villains who often just about talked Bond to death before leaving him alone to expire which of course meant hed just escape and prevent the end of the world. As re-imagined by director Martin Campbell (who helmed ""GoldenEye"") and veteran Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with help from Canadian Paul Haggis of ""Crash"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"") the 21st-century James Bond is an arrogant and sometimes reckless agent at the outset of his career who kills without remorse and confines his trysting activities to married women because that makes it easier to stay emotionally uninvolved. After the prologue and a mediocre opening-credits theme song from rocker Chris Cornell we pick up the action in Africa with Bond giving chase to a terrorist bomber in an extended sequence on a construction site that features more death-defying leaps and bounds than a Jet Li film. Its an impressively shot crowd-pleaser - but its also far too long and complicated which could be said of the film as a whole. (This is only the first of TWO elaborate action sequences involving construction sites.) At 144 minutes ""Casino Royale"" would have benefited from a 25- minute trim - and maybe a handy ""Know Your Villains"" brochure to keep us up to speed on all the plot machinations and the various ultra-evil bad guys who pop in and out. (Its never a good sign when youre more than two hours into a movie and youre still not entirely certain which guy is supposed to be the main villain.) The filmmakers also make a key mistake in that first action sequence thats repeated later in the film They give us the chase scene first and then explain who Bond is chasing and why. This diffuses our interest and investment in Bond actually you know catching the guy. In any case Bonds first major assignment results in an international embarrassment for the MI6 and earns Bond a major dressing-down from Judi Denchs M who has such little faith in this ""blunt instrument"" as she calls him that she has a chip implanted in his forearm so the agency can track his every movement. In rapid-fire fashion Bond zips from the Bahamas to Miami to Venice among other locales pausing just long enough to dispatch a henchman here and there in hand-to-hand combat or with a quick burst of gunfire. (He also hooks up with the luscious wife of one adversary but before the act can be consummated he has to resume the chase so he orders champagne from room service and slips away without looking back. At that moment we wonder if this guy is going to be the stupidest James Bond ever.) Bonds main prey seems to be a Eurotrashy snake named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen in a bland performance) who occasionally sheds a tear of real blood due to some unexplained injury to one eye. Le Chiffre is a financially strapped terrorist who aims to win more than 100 million in a high-stakes poker showdown at the Casino Royale in Montenegro that would have even Phil Ivey saying ""Thats too rich for my blood."" As luck (so to speak) would have it Bond is the best poker player in the MI6 so the British government funds his 10 million buy-in to the tournament and assigns an accountant named Vesper Lynd (the gorgeous French actress Eva Green) to oversee his table skills and determine whether Bond should be given a 5 million re-buy should the occasion arise. The poker game scenes are expertly shot and filled with humorous asides and some violent escapades during breaks in the table action. (Unfortunately the final showdown like the Steve McQueen- Edward G. Robinson confrontation in ""The Cincinnati Kid"" features card combinations you wouldnt see in a real poker game if you played every day for a thousand years.) Along the way Bond forges alliances with a Montenegro connection (Giancarlo Giannini) who seems to know everybody and an American poker player (Jeffrey Wright) - and of course he begins the dance of courtship with Vesper Lynd who is immune to his charms. For a while. ""Casino Royale"" is not without a sense of humour. There are several winks to the franchise from the martini orders to the appearance of a 1964 Aston Martin to Bonds joke that Lynds alias is going to be ""Stephanie Broadchest."" And when Bond identifies himself - well its one of the most satisfying utterances of ""Bond James Bond"" in the storied history of the franchise. The problems arise because this edition is too lengthy and too complicated but it still isnt really about anything other than introducing Craig as the next Bond - a stripped-down gimmick-free government assassin who makes a lot of mistakes this time around but wont be so careless with his gun or with his heart the next time we see him.

Related ABC News gets Rahners take on Bond Movie review Showtimes and trailer ""Casino Royale"" opens midnight tonight. With Daniel Craig Eva Green Mads Mikkelsen Judi Dench and Jeffrey Wright. Directed by Martin Campbell from a screenplay by Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Paul Haggis. 144 minutes. Rated PG-13 for scenes of violent action a scene of torture sexual content and nudity. Several theaters. I wanted to put a pillow over his face. To end it for what was left of his own dignity. Because its hard to see someone you love become so humiliated. But now Im glad they didnt euthanize James Bond because ""Casino Royale"" is the best movie of the series in almost 40 years. Keep your wallet holstered for a second though and reflect on their long decline on how theyd become increasingly tired silly overblown cliche-ridden copies of copies. Remember that the ""Bourne"" flicks almost finished the hit job that Austin Powers had started on the perfect Cold War spy who made no sense in the 21st century. To sum up Expectations were low. So when a bartender asks if hed like his martini shaken or stirred and the new pissed-off Bond answers ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" I think I let out some sort of involuntary hoot. This is a ""Royale"" without the cheese a stripped-down brutal relaunch of the character in the spirit of ""Batman Begins"" thats light on gadgets and quips and starts as hes just gotten his double-0 license to kill from Her Majestys Secret Service. Also as you may have heard if you live anywhere with electricity controversial new Bond Daniel Craig replaces Pierce Brosnan. Ian Flemings 1953 ""Casino Royale"" -- his first Bond novel -- became a wacky star-studded train-wreck of a movie comedy in 1967 not to mention an unwatchable American TV drama in 1954 -- starring Barry Nelson as ""Jimmy"" Bond. This one honors the basics of the skeletal 144-page book with some necessary padding and updates -- and yes an infamous genital torture scene. After a mad hair-raising chase that fails to bring down an African terrorist the freshly-minted 007 is in hot water with ""M"" (Judi Dench). She considers him an embarrassment and a ""blunt instrument"" so reckless and egotistical that she questions the wisdom of promoting him. Bonds first major nemesis not a mad genius bent on world destruction/domination/extortion but the terrorists banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). Le Chiffre has a scarred eye that sometimes weeps blood tears and a gambling habit thats lost his clients money in bad stock market bets. When he goes to a high-stakes French poker game to recoup his losses Bond -- the best card player in the service -- goes there to break him. Chemistry almost occurs when Bond meets his government money-woman Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). She verbally spars with the cocky agent on a train ride and later decides theres not enough room in an elevator for the two of them and his ego. Green made a strong impression in Bernardo Bertoluccis 2003 ""The Dreamers"" and is as beautiful as any Bond girl but she doesnt come close to having the spark of her predecessors Honor Blackman (Pussy Galore) or Diana Rigg (Countess Tracy). Since this isnt your typical formulaic Bond run-through thats enough plot revealed. Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Patrick Wade were responsible for the moronic ""Die Another Day"" in 2002 so Oscar-winner ""Crash"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" scribe Paul Haggis must have injected the class here. On to Craig Fans roughed him up when he landed the gig but he merits the benefit of the doubt. Hes an odd tough kind of handsome vastly different from the male-model looks of Brosnan. Craig doesnt show the suaveness of earlier Bonds but this is meant to be 007 before hes fully formed. The fact is by the time Brosnan uttered his last ""Bond James Bond"" it induced the same kind of cringes as Dr. Angus (""Youre cheesy"") in the Burger King commercials. When Craig says the words at the end of ""Casino Royale"" it feels earned and righteous. Craig is by far the most physical Bond and the action is admirably furious. This Bond tries really hard. He gets cut and bleeds and has emotions like the literary Bond -- who fell in love more than once. Hes less self-assured (for Bond not regular humans) checking out his new dinner jacket in a mirror and congratulating himself after Vesper laughs at one of his cracks. Weve never seen Bond dabbing at a wound in the bathroom before. A note to the filmmakers though James Bond is not a decathlete. An early chase after an athletic ""free-running"" bomb-maker that winds up at dizzying heights becomes Warner-Bros.-esque. Likewise a climactic set piece involving a sinking building in Venice is just too much for the vibe theyre going for. Purists will grumble that the centerpiece card game is changed from baccarat to Texas hold em. But the real problem is that director Martin Campbell fails to deliver tension in the hard-to-follow match. A couple of explanations from a character on the side are laughable attempts to compensate. Still the adventure is reinvigorating enough that I hope theyll give the same treatment to other Fleming novels -- such as ""Moonraker"" a missile-aimed-at-London thriller that bears no resemblance to the space-comedy film. The new guys rough around the edges but lets keep his license renewed a while longer.

In ""Quantum of Solace"" James Bond orders the revenge buffet deluxe. We begin just after ""Casino Royale"" with Bonds girlfriend Vesper dead and her (other missing) boyfriend suspected in forcing the events that led to her death which was perhaps the first suicide by drowning in an elevator yet recorded on-screen. With Vesper gone the only woman around who understands Bond (a well-scuffed Daniel Craig) is Judi Denchs M and the way these two hurl flameball glances at each other re-creates the kind of raw sexual tension unseen since the early days of the Siskel and Ebert show. Who needs Moneypenny when youve got Wenchy Denchy? M gets betrayed by her own bodyguard who is linked to another assassin for whom 007 is mistaken in Haiti by a lynxlike cutie (Olga Kurylenko) who picks Bond up tries to kill him and introduces him to this evenings villain Greene (Mathieu Amalric of ""Munich""). Greene as you might guess from his name is an enviro-goon (Ive had my eye on those tree-huggers for just this kind of skullduggery) who under the cover of his conservationist (i.e. destructionist) group is fomenting a coup in Bolivia in a swap for a worthless piece of desert land. You can never take a coup-fomenter at his word though and Amalric has the smirky menace to suggest the sleaze of Roman Polanski (both in ""Chinatown"" and real life). Greene turns out to be well-connected Among his Facebook friends are the CIA who share their private plane with Greene as they lead the cheers for his coup. In the background you can see the favored reading material of these malefactors The New Yorker and The New York Times. Bond even manages to turn the Brits against him. The character has never been taken to such extremes never before been such a cold isolated bastard. He leaves a friend dead in a garbage bin dispenses with all niceties (there is no ""Bond James Bond"" no casino scene no loyalty to anyone but himself). When he drinks it isnt to be suave its to get drunk. He cant sleep. ""I dont have any friends"" he says. Possibly only the Dark Knight and Dick Cheney are as unpopular. The man has been worked as hard as his poor Aston Martin the one that gets its drivers side door clipped off in the opening chase. Which is the first of the many action scenes that turn up as regularly as Weather on the 1s. Theres no use pretending that the story has any purpose except to link the chase-ems-and-shoot-ems but director Marc Forster (previously associated with semi-arty films ""Monsters Ball"" ""Finding Neverland"") borrows heavily from the Bourne movies racing through jagged close-ups that thrust you in the middle gasping. Forster even turns a phone call into a blaze of graphics that suggests John King simultaneously charting the House Senate and White House races. I personally would have a lot more confidence in our spy agencies if they could at least come up with a cool interface to explain why they cant find bin Laden. The action geometry can be muddled. During a rooftop chase in Siena that involves breaking scaffolding a flying girder Tarzanish clinging to ropes and sheets of breaking glass I wasnt sure whether it was Bond or the villain who yelled ""Aaaagh"" Nor could I figure out what was happening in the airplane chase or how it is that a parachute that opens 6 inches before you hit the ground is going to keep you from shattering into subatomic fragments. But does it matter? Being equally thrilling and confusing certainly made the seventh-grade dance memorable and it works for Forster. Classic-yet-new is also tricky. With a script by Paul Haggis Neal Purvis and Robert Wade Forster manages. The wit is as dry as the rocky desert where Greene stores his nefarious dreams ""Dont bleed to death"" ""When they say Weve got people everywhere you expect it to be hyperbole."" A surprise reference to ""Goldfinger"" is worked in beautifully while ""He just smiled at me - and set the house on fire"" and ""Yeah youre right we should just deal with nice people"" bring a bitter hurt unknown to say Pierce Brosnans Bond the non-brute with the invisi-car. Kurylenko who looks like a cross between Ami1/2lie and Thandie Newton is a big Bond-aid too Im not going to mention the names of any actress who failed on this score but a Bond Girl must be not only beautiful but also interesting. Denise Richards. Where ""Quantum"" falls well short of ""Casino Royale"" is in the ending. This one is bland James Bland. Key characters meet their fates off-screen and its only because the Bond music blasts you out of your seat to hustle in the next crowd that you know the thing is done. We can only hope the next chapter will deliver something that would burn as hot as Keith Olbermanns temper Bond vs. Bourne.

With Daniel Craig Eva Green Judi Dench. Director Martin Campbell (224). PG-13 Violence sexuality language. Area theaters 3.5 STARS.. FANS OF ANYONE other than Sean Connery who has played James Bond may want to look away because admirers of Ian Flemings 007 novels are almost bound to agree that Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean. Craig who makes his Bond debut in Martin Campbells ""Casino Royale"" has the craggy good looks attributed to him by Fleming in his first novel which happens to have been ""Casino Royale."" He is the most athletic has the hardest edge and he looks like he could lock his jaws on any of the others and shake them like a martini. What Craig who was born six years after Connerys 1962 debut in ""Dr. No"" may lack in insouciance he makes up for in youthful enthusiasm. And that is as it should be for what marks a restart of the Bond franchise taking us back to the beginning of his career with MI6. ""Casino Royale"" was published in 1953 and though it was adapted as a campy spy spoof starring David Niven in 1967 the ""Casino"" opening with midnight screenings today is the first under the series banner of EON Productions. In it the eager Bond has just been promoted to double-0 status having earned his license to kill by taking down a counterspy and his associate which we see in the black-and-white prologue. On his first assignment in Africa Bond causes an international incident earning himself a rebuke from his no-nonsense boss M (Judi Dench better than ever). But he rights himself in her eyes on a followup mission to the Bahamas and gets approval to take on terrorist banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) in a winner-take-all game of Texas Hold Em in Montenegro. The plot follows the basic outline of the novel but is updated to post-9/11 with terrorism taking over as the bogeyman from the Soviet spy agency SMERSH. At the same time the movies action sequences are old-fashioned compared to the increasingly ridiculous special effects-laden Bond movies of the Roger Moore era onward. The behind-the-scenes heroes of ""Casino"" are the stuntmen doubling for the actors in leaps from buildings and cranes and the choreographers of the brutal hand-to-hand fights between Bond and an assortment of villains. The third act which is designed to explain the cynicism that will carry Bond through his next few movies is not quite a mess but it is way too long and it is a definite letdown from what precedes it. What I like best about the film is the relationship allowed to develop between Bond and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) the voluptuous MI6 banker who accompanies him to Montenegro to oversee the agencys 10 million stake in the poker game. Bonds armored emotions limit him to bedding married women like the slinky Solange (Caterina Murino) wife of one of Le Chiffres go-betweens. So Vesper is safe from his seductive wiles until her sharp wit her vulnerability and her quick action in saving his life get to him and he falls in love. Craig and Green a French beauty who made her debut in Bernardo Bertoluccis ""The Dreamers"" are so perfectly suited in character that you will be hoping against hope that they team up for future assignments - Agents 007 and 36-C (code designation approximate). But all I know for sure is that when Craig ends the movie with the line ""The name is Bond James Bond"" ""Casino Royale"" assures us that well hear him deliver it again. jmathewsnydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Not quite the same as the old Bond. 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Casino Royale Action drama. Starring Daniel Craig Eva Green and Judi Dench. Directed by Martin Campbell. (PG-13. 142 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) This is the first Bond movie in many years that isnt an exercise in nostalgia or an attempt to initiate new pledges into an ancient cult. Neither is it one of those joyless efforts like the flat Timothy Dalton Bonds of the 1980s which self-consciously tried to recapture the ""authenticity"" of Ian Flemings initial inspiration. [Podcast Mick LaSalle says new blond Bond is terrific.] ""Casino Royale"" is fresh actually fresh. When you consider how long the Bond series has tried to regain imitate or fabricate freshness thats quite an achievement. The pictures great asset is the new Bond Daniel Craig. Picture a British Steve McQueen. Craig has two big things in his favor. The first is that hes young. At 38 hes the youngest Bond since 1969. The second is that hes an excellent actor. Its hard to say which of these advantages is more important because youth is a big part of his appeal. Theres just something about being in ones 30s that lends itself more to jumping off buildings stabbing and shooting people and seducing the most beautiful women in the world. By the time youre in your 40s  you get tired of all that. Related Stories Forget all the other Bonds. This Bond rebuilds the franchise from the ground up. The striking thing about Craigs performance is that he seems to have been able to tune out more than 40 years of screen history and approach Bond as just another role. Everyone else since Sean Connery introduced the role has approached Bond as a test of virility and though theyve all manage to pass more or less the strain has been evident. Craig doesnt try to uphold explode rediscover or reimagine anything. He just finds Bond on his own as a rough guy with a grim sense of humor who has not yet discovered himself as the coolest of the cool. This Bond looks like an ape in a tuxedo and his blond hair has a way of sticking out. Hes a working-class guy who has made his way into upper-class circles but retains some residual coarseness that will never smooth out. We first encounter Bond chasing a man through some exotic location leaping from construction cranes and bouncing off roofs behaving like a reckless cop. The clock has been reset. Bond is now a young agent unseasoned and undisciplined who has only recently been elevated to double-0 status. He alienates his superiors -- embodied by Judi Dench as the long-suffering M -- and ends up pursuing a terrorist-financing scheme on his own on Paradise Island in the Bahamas. Hes in pursuit of an especially vivid Bond villain an international banker named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who has a dead eye and a disorder that causes him to weep blood. The advance publicity for James Bond movies usually features an interview with an actress who insists that shes not playing the typical Bond girl. Yet invariably the movie comes out and theres Halle Berry or some other serious actress suddenly acting like an idiot. The pattern is broken with Eva Green the French actress best known for her debut performance in Bernardo Bertoluccis ""The Dreamers."" She plays Vesper the representative of a bank thats fronting Bond in a high-stakes poker game and her interaction with Bond is that of two professionals coming to trust each other in a working relationship. Shes not interested in seducing him; shes interested in his moral nature as it gradually reveals itself. And because shes serious and perceptive she cracks through his facade. McQueen though remembered for his unflappable reserve had a disarming way of acting like a regular guy without losing his movie star allure. Craig has some of that quality. He doesnt hide himself and hes not too self-conscious to laugh or be put off. His interaction with Green is the richer for those human qualities. This Bond is not all about posing. Everything one expects from a James Bond film is here but better. Bond gets off wisecracks at the expense of his adversaries but this time a ruefulness underlies them This Bond isnt invincible and he half expects that next time his number will come up. The Bahamas Miami Prague and Venice all look great but theyre not just about scenery. The locations are used. A chase on foot through St. Marks Square becomes a nightmare with all the tourists everywhere. And the special effect of a 16th century villa sinking into the Grand Canal is remarkably convincing. There are action set pieces but unlike in the other Bonds there is never a sense of oh-here-comes-the-set-piece. The film is an integrated whole. ""Casino Royale"" brings vigor to the Bond franchise and the possibility of new directions. Pierce Brosnan played the same fellow that Dalton Roger Moore and Connery played and that was a burden. Craig gets to start from the ground up and create a brand-new guy. Hes not the old James Bond but someone more interesting. -- Advisory Violence semi-nudity and sexual situations.

In this 21st official screen outing for Ian Flemings evergreen MI6 agent the cars are as fast as ever and the women even faster but the villain du jour isnt a Dr. Evil-type mastermind hell-bent on world domination. Instead hes merely a wealthy private banker called Le Chiffre who believes firmly in equal-opportunity lending especially where international terrorists are concerned. And just how much money does the newly cash-poor Le Chiffre (played by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen with a nifty ocular scar that bleeds bright-red tears) need in order to keep his operation solvent? Why a mere 150 million which he intends to pocket from a winner-take-all poker tournament at the titular Montenegran gambling parlor. A sum I feel compelled to note thats a fair bit less than the cost of making and marketing a James Bond movie. These days it seems anarchy comes cheap; its entertainment thats expensive.A more modestly scaled bad guy isnt the only surprise Casino Royalehas up its tuxedoed sleeve. Borrowing its title and its inspiration from the first of Flemings Bond novels (previously the basis for 1967s lamentable Bond parody movie of the same name) it gives us a wet-behind-the-ears super spy whos only just graduated to coveted 00 status who doesnt much know the difference between a shaken and stirred martini let alone care and who doesnt get behind the wheel of an Aston Martin until a third of the way through the picture. (Until then its--egads--a Ford rental car for him.) This is meant to be a less elegant more rough-and-tumble Bond than were accustomed to--Bond before he becomes ""Bond James Bond."" So its only fitting that longtime series producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli have selected a new actor for the role though unless youve been on permanent vacation from the Internet you already know that the choice of Daniel Craig--the shortest blondest actor ever to play Bond--isnt to the liking of some die-hard fans.As it turns out everything that seems ""wrong"" about Craig (who was last seen as one half of the oddball jailhouse romance between Truman Capote and convicted killer Perry Smith in Douglas McGraths superb Infamous) is exactly what makes him right for this incarnation of Bond. Built like a scrum-half and possessing the granitic countenance of a nightclub bouncer Craig is brusque and bullish and when he squeezes his stocky physique into a tailored dinner jacket he seems very much Flemings orphan from the wrong side of the tracks trying (with only partial success) to conceal his hardscrabble past. And though this Bond disposes of his enemies as quickly and mercilessly as any 00 agent must he doesnt laugh off his kills with a wink and a pithy one-liner. Its certainly the most sober read on the role since Timothy Dalton played Bond for a two-picture stint in the late 1980s but also the most human and vulnerable 007 since George Lazenby wept over the body of his assassinated bride in the final frames of 1969s On Her Majestys Secret Service.To that end Craig is very well paired with the strapping French siren Eva Green (The Dreamers) whose by-the-book Treasury officer Vesper Lynd is probably the most complex creation in the ""Bond girl"" canon--neither the submissive flirt or ball-busting vixen of Bond adventures old nor the extreme sportswoman (Michelle Yeoh Halle Berry) of more recent vintage but rather a smart sexy independent-minded femme whose relationship with Bond is based on something deeper than the exchange of mutually seductive charms. Meeting on a train they chew on some terrifically punchy dialogue (courtesy one assumes of Crashand Million Dollar Babyscribe Paul Haggis who receives co-screenplay credit alongside regular series writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade) thats like the smart double-entendre-laden lingo prospective lovers used to bat around in literate Hollywood romantic comedies. And when he comforts her following a frightening shootout in a hotel stairwell its tender and affecting in a way we dont expect from a James Bond movie.Of course we dont really go to Bond movies for the dialogue and the romance. We go for the action and on that front Casino Royaledelivers--if like everything else about the picture in a refreshingly downsized way. When the New Zealand-born director Martin Campbell last sat at the helm of a Bond movie on 1995s Goldeneye he had Pierce Brosnan tear through the streets of St. Petersburg in a Russian army tank. Here he keeps things considerably more spartan beginning with an exhilarating foot chase as Bond pursues a terror suspect (French ""free running"" champion Sbastien Foucan) through a Madagascar construction site thats a ballet of gravity-defying acrobatics as if Spider-Man were fleeing from Fred Astaire. An opening like that is hard to follow but Campbell keeps things moving at a clip bringing a different sort of tension to the casino scenes which could have stopped the movie dead in its tracks but instead play out like a sweeps-week episode of Celebrity Poker Showdownin which one of the celebrities happens to be Osama bin Ladens personal financial planner. In short if he wins we all lose.Like Guy Hamilton (Goldfinger Diamonds Are Forever) and John Glen (For Your Eyes Only Octopussy) before him Campbell is an ideal director for Bond because he doesnt try to impose a personal style on the proceedings. (He may not even have one but thats another matter.) After all new casting and updated gadgetry aside Bond remains the most unrepentantly old-fashioned of Hollywood movie franchises in large part due to the storied unwillingness of Broccoli and Wilson to tinker with their proven formula despite the expressed desires of Steven Spielberg and Quentin Tarantino to try their hand at the series. But Broccoli and Wilson have dug in their heels and following a brief fallow period in the early 1990s time has proven them right. As of the last episode Die Another Day Bond was as popular and profitable as ever and I suspect Casino Royalewill continue the trend. For whats appealing about Bond is precisely its un-hip classicism--its promise of clean crisp excitement delivered without the interference of whiplash-inducing camera pyrotechnics attention-deficient editing patterns gratuitous color tinting and/or ear-splitting rock ballads. To be sure the series has occasionally spun out into the stratosphere (quite literally in the case of 1979s Moonraker) and needed to be reset. But Casino Royaledoes that ably and when its all over you can take renewed pleasure in that famous end-credits guarantee ""James Bond Will Return.""CASINO ROYALE WAS DIRECTED BY MARTIN CAMPBELL; WRITTEN BY NEAL PURVIS ROBERT WADE AND PAUL HAGGIS BASED ON THE NOVEL BY IAN FLEMING; PRODUCED BY MICHAEL G.

Comments Casino Royale Recommended Clive Owen seemed like the natural choice but in casting Daniel Craig as the new James Bond franchise owners Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson opted for someone who looked cold enough to kill a man with his bare hands. That he does in a brutal black-and-white opening sequence and for the rest of the movie Craigs wardrobe seems to alternate between crisp evening clothes and other peoples blood. The script updates Ian Flemings first Bond novel to a post-9/11 world and scales back the silliness that always seems to creep into the series; director Martin Campbell (The Mask of Zorro) contributes some superior action set pieces but keeps the camp and gadgetry to a minimum. With Eva Green Judi Dench Jeffrey Wright Giancarlo Giannini and liver-lipped Mads Mikkelsen as the villain an international terrorism financier who weeps drops of blood. PG-13 144 min. By J.R.

Casino barman Shaken or stirred? Bond Do I look like I give a damn? Its a sharp and knowing line - probably penned by Paul Haggis the talented final scriptwriter of this highly enjoyable back-to-basics re-boot of the 007 franchise - that not only simultaneously acknowledges and confounds audience expectations but also neatly confirms that Daniel Craigs intriguing and charismatic tyro agent is cut from quite different cloth to his Savile Row-tailored predecessors. Ian Flemings titular 1953 Cold-War source novel presented a proto-Bond; and its interesting how much licence Cambells confidently directed action thriller takes with it. Gone is the RN commander; as the jagged handheld monochrome opening sequence of Craig drowning his first kill in a blood-strewn public toilet shows this Bonds a tough no-nonsense Mondeo-driving product of the who dares wins SAS school rather than the snobby naval wardroom and he has some of the social contempt as well as the pumping thighs bulging pecs and inflated ego to prove it. Cobra-baiting in Madagascar car-chases in Nassau Montenegro Miami - theres enough globe-trotting to please the purists. But notwithstanding the fine CGI/special effects best used in the climactic set-piece involving a disintegating Venetian palazzo Campbell has cut down the gadgets and gizmos (not to mention Q) to inject some needed realismo back into the action sequences steering a neat line between romance and thrills. Eva Greens Vesper Lynd - a government accountant assigned to keep an eye on the millions Bond stakes in the crucial poker game with Mads Mikkelsens pleasingly sadistic terrorist-banker Le Chiffre - proves a sexy sparring equal to the increasingly smitten and vulnerable Bond having been donated an audacious amount of screen time. The politics are coy David Arnolds score is maybe underwhelming and Phil Meheuxs cinematography merely efficient but otherwise Casino Royale kicks new life (literally as well as metaphorically) into the ageing hero.

It was packaged like a cynical weary best-of concert coughed up by an aging dinosaur offering copious nods to the franchises past without bothering to offer any new material of consequence. Yet here we are not only prolonging the franchise but at its very beginning the third attempt to perfect Casino Royale the very first book in Ian Flemings series which began in 1953.Set in the present day this kinetic character-driven take is nonetheless intended to serve as the origin story of 007--an introduction to the ""mal-adjusted young man"" as one love interest refers to him who grows up to inherit a license to kill from Her Royal Highness.And of course Royale is intended to kick-start a moribund big-screen series thats had more low points than high. Yet to say Casino Royale ranks among the best Bond offerings is not intended as backhanded praise.Absolutely it goes on too long clocking in at 144 minutes and absolutely half of the damned thing makes no sense at all but beneath all the gimmicks and gadgets--chief among them a collection of cell phones capable of doing things of which Catherine Zeta-Jones never dreamed--is an actor who brings to Bond all the things hes lacked since Sean Connery fought the Cold War in a toupee.Those who sweated and fretted Daniel Craigs casting in the role clearly never saw Layer Cake a sort of gangster-fried warm-up to Bond. Craig excellent in both art house endeavors (The Mother Enduring Love) and blockbuster think pieces (Munich) has both a nasty streak and a soft side never before seen in the series; Fleming would recognize him as most like his literary creation damaged goods in a tailored tux.This Bond unlike his smug self-conscious predecessors is a deadpan executioner with a penchant for letting his guard down too quickly. ""I have no armor left"" he tells this installments love interest British-treasury purse keeper Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) with whom Bond actually falls in love rather than merely into bed. This Bonds a rookie who makes mistakes that nearly lead to his death on several occasions--and to a torture sequence so simple yet so devious (and deviant) it makes Goldfingers crotch laser seem tame. And this Bond has little interest in living up to the legend When a bartender asks him if hed like his martini shaken or stirred Bond shoots back ""Do I look like I care?"" In that instant its as if the part had never been anyone elses.Adhering faithfully to the novel writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (now on their third Bond movie) and Crashs Paul Haggis offer the quintessential Bond plot. Theres the oily Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) with the slight disfigurement in this case a scarred left eye that weeps blood. Theres the story line involving the funding of baddies trying to take over the world (terrorists in this case as opposed to yesteryears Russians). And theres M (Judi Dench) the scolding boss always one moment away from revoking Bonds license.Theres also the bullet-gray Aston Martin the high-stakes card game (Texas hold-em to appeal to the dorm room audience) the champagne-and-caviar romp with a villains wife the travel mag settings (the Bahamas Miami Prague) and all the other accoutrements that decorate the doings. We are starting over but not from scratch. Bond fans dont want reinvention; theyll settle for rejuvenation.Director Martin Campbell who resurrected the franchise with GoldenEye upon the hiring of Pierce Brosnan 11 years ago accomplishes the same thing again-- tenfold. No Bond film has ever offered a chase sequence on par with the opening one here during which Bond and a bomb maker scurry on foot all over Madagascar. It blends the raw materials of such free-running films as Ong-bak and District B13 in which characters gallop and soar through cityscapes like everyday supermen with the archaic conventions of the franchise and refines the whole lot into something crisp thrilling and brand-new. And that is great praise to heap upon a 53-year-old character who you were just sure should have retired a long long time ago.

Obamas DNC Speech His Last Wink Out the Door Inside Halseys Troubled Past Chaotic Present Casino Royale By Peter Travers November 17 2006 More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> Theres one whopper of a reason why Casino Royale is the hippest highest-octane Bond film in ages and his name is Daniel Craig. This rugged jug-eared Brit whose irregular features improbably radiate a megawatt star charisma gets the last laugh on the Internet buzz killers whove been ragging on him at craignotbond.com for being blond and blue-eyed and too short (five-eleven) for Bond duty. Not only is Craig 38 the best Bond since Sean Connery hes the first of the Bonds (great Scot Connery one-shot George Lazenby charmer Roger Moore stuff-shirt Timothy Dalton and smoothie Pierce Brosnan) to lose the condescension and take the role seriously. More News Sundance 2015 Stars Answer Peter Travers Burning Question 10 Best Movies of 2014 All Stories >> Craig reinvigorates a fagged-out franchise thats been laying on bigger stunts and sillier gadgets to disguise the fact that its run out of ideas. And he does it with an actors skill an athletes grace and a dangerous glint that puts you on notice that Bond James Bond is back in business. Sad to say Casino Royale is also weighed down by action-business-as-usual. Craigs a live wire closer to the blunt instrument Ian Fleming imagined when he created the character in 1953 but he cant mess too much with the winning formula begun with 1962s Dr. No. Bond producer Albert ""Cubby"" Broccoli who died in 1996 left the golden goose in the care of his daughter Barbara Broccoli and his stepson Michael Wilson who fully grasp that the four stunt-loaded Bond flicks with Brosnan are the most lucrative in the twenty-film series and that they cant spend 150 million to produce a 007 art film. Still the producers deserve credit for busting Bond at least partly out of the box. The film opens promisingly with a scene - strikingly shot in black-and-white - that sets up Bond as an MI6 agent who may be too much of a hothead to earn double-0 status and a license to kill. Then come the familiar credits and the typical song (""You Know My Name"" by Chris Cornell) followed by a full-bore full-color foot chase across rooftops in Africa. Though efficiently directed by GoldenEyes Martin Campbell the chase stalls the movie and worse delays getting us up close and personal with Craig. Seeing him run and sweat isnt half as much fun as seeing him act. After that everything gets better. Casino Royale heavier on character than action was the first book in Flemings Bond series making it the ideal place to start the wheel spinning anew. Thats right Casino Royale acts like the other Bond movies never existed. Were back at square one only the time is now the fantasy is limited and the story is anchored in reality. Q with his gadgets and invisible cars is nowhere to be seen. The tone is set when Bond orders a martini. ""Shaken or stirred?"" asks the bartender. Craig delivers the answer straight-up and bone-dry ""Do I look like I give a damn?""gt;And were off with even the stock elements getting a fresh twist. Take the villain Hes Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) a banker who launders money for terrorists. Its a bit of a Dr. Evil parody that Le Chiffre cries tears of blood but Mikkelsen a star in his native Denmark gives off a genuine eww vibe especially when he tortures Bond with a testicle squeeze and pauses to leer at his naked body. Hero and villain go at it most excitingly over a poker table at Montenegros Casino Royale where a test of character not strength will determine the eventual winner. What about the Bond girls? The gorgeous Caterina Murino sizzles as Solange a babe he takes back to his hotel room for a roll on the floor that causes serious rug burns. But its Eva Green as Vesper Lynd a British treasury operative sent to stake Bond at the poker tables who lifts her role to class-act status. Oscar winner Paul Haggis (Crash) contributes sly dialogue to a script that goes far beyond kiss-kiss/bang-bang. A scene in which Bond and Vesper attempt to guess each others past histories trumps its comic zing with romantic gravity. It also helps that Craig is mixing it up with a first-rate cast including Jeffrey Wright as CIA agent Felix Leiter Giancarlo Giannini as MI6 contact Mathis and most especially Judi Dench back in the game as M Bonds boss. Dame Judi put her power on hold in the lightweight Brosnan films but with Craig she comes out blazing knowing shes found an actor who can give as good as he gets. As the plot globe-trots from Prague London Miami and the Bahamas to an overblown climax in the canals of Venice Casino Royale uncovers something unique in the 007 dossier an unformed secret-agent man lacking polish vulnerable to violence and helplessly lost in love. Craig gives us James Bond in the fascinating act of inventing himself. This you do not want to miss. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

"Casino Royale holds a winning hand for Craig - News - Gainesville Sun - Gainesville FL News Sports Entertainment Obituaries e-edition Jobs Cars Homes Classifieds Site Archive log in It would have been enough just inserting a fresh face Daniel Craig as 007 in ""Casino Royale"" to give a whole new look and feel to the James Bond franchise. Yet taking the worlds greatest spy back to his roots as a raw impressionable brute whose cockiness at times fails him and who can lose his heart to a woman was a keen stroke of intelligence. ""Casino Royale"" may weigh in a bit lighter than many of the 20 preceding Bond flicks on explosions gunplay fisticuffs and other action. What it does have in those regards is riveting clever and well-choreographed yet the appeal this time lays much heavier on Bond as a person on his development as one of cinemas deadliest killers and most heartless womanizers. Craig plays Bond at a crossroads which could lead him deeper down the loners path of international intrigue or into a more conventional happier companionable life. He stacks up well against his five Bond predecessors. Craigs no Sean Connery (who is?) but he delivers one of the finest performances ever in a 007 flick rich with a range of feeling we generally dont see in the emotionally stunted Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell - who also made ""GoldenEye"" Pierce Brosnans first time out as Bond - ""Casino Royale"" is based on the first of Ian Flemings novels about the British agent. The 1950s story is updated from the Cold War era to modern times by veteran Bond screenwriters Neal Purvis Robert Wade and Paul Haggis who no doubt contributed much of the foreboding drama to the action. Freshly bumped up to ""Double-Oh"" license-to-kill status young Bond already is his own man alternately impressing and infuriating spymaster M (Judi Dench making a welcome return from the Brosnan era and bringing her usual wondrous imperiousness to the role). Bond is assigned to play in a high-stakes poker match in Italy orchestrated by Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) a financier of global terrorism who needs to win the 100-million-plus stake to pay back clients money he squandered on an investment. That Bond was the reason his investment went sour makes it all the more poetic as the card game and its ramifications will have such a huge impact on Bonds destiny. A Treasury official - beautiful of course - is assigned to keep tabs on Bonds gambling stake and make sure hes playing prudently with the Crowns chips. Eva Greens Vesper Lynd is everything most Bond girls are not - smart sarcastic willful and fiercely independent enough not to give in to Bonds charms. Vesper is James equal in so many ways - not a fighter but a thinker able to do a magnificently witty dissection of 007s character and accept with grace his own playfully insightful critique of her. Theres almost a ""Thin Man"" quality to their banter. You can imagine William Powell and Myrna Loys Nick and Nora Charles started out cutely bickering this way before they became such suave lovebirds. Unlike past Bond films in which our heros most important relationship is with the villain hes trying to take down its the love story that really matters here. ""Casino Royale"" plays out like a grand doomed romantic epic in which James callous nature is cemented in place by the outcome of his attachment to Vesper. In a climactic showdown with Le Chiffre Craigs Bond is arguably more vulnerable both physically and emotionally than weve ever seen 007 (though the tragic end of ""On Her Majestys Secret Service"" George Lazenbys sole unpropitious turn as Bond comes close). And at this moment when he could be broken for good and left a wispy shadow who never would have become a golden boy of British intelligence Bonds cheeky humor and unbendable pigheadedness assert themselves a terrific foundation for the adventures to come. Its a formative moment in a movie full of formative moments that spell an ominous but productive future for Bond and a brilliant and even more productive future for Craig as Bond. xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx About Us Sign up for daily e-mail Subscribe Reader Services Subscribe Now Manage My Account Vacation Stops/Restarts FAQs Contact Us Terms of Service Submissions News Tips Letters to the Editor Calendar Events Obituaries Legal Notices Advertising Advertising Advertise With Us Place an Ad Display Ads Classified Ads Online Services Newsletters Online Services RSS Feeds Text Alerts Archives Propel Marketing (c) Copyright 2006-2016 GateHouse Media Inc.

By Anthony Lane Who said this ""It is interesting for me to see this new Bond. Englishmen are so odd. They are like a nest of Chinese boxes. It takes a very long time to get to the center of them. When one gets there the result is unrewarding but the process is instructive and entertaining."" The speaker is Mathis a kindly French liaison officer in ""Casino Royale"" Ian Flemings first James Bond novel published in 1953. More than half a century later we are back with ""Casino Royale"" No. 21 in the roster of official Bond films and we are back with Mathis. As played by Giancarlo Giannini who was recently seen having his intestines removed in ""Hannibal"" he is pouchy affable and dangerously wise and his presence hints that this new adventure will not be an occasion for silliness no calendar girls no blundering boffins no giants with dentures of steel. The same goes for hardware with rockets and gadgets alike being trimmed to the minimum. It is true that Bond keeps a defibrillator in the glove compartment of his Aston Martin but given the cholesterol levels of the kind of people who drive Aston Martins a heart-starter presumably comes standard like a wheel jack. Whether Bond has a heart worth starting is another matter. He is now played by Daniel Craig as the world knows and if I had my way the world would have shut up about it for the past thirteen months and waited to see the result. Mathis was right what we get is a Chinese box although ones initial impression is that the outermost box is a packing crate. I cannot prove it but I suspect that God may have designed Craig during a slightly ham-fisted attempt at woodworking. His head is a rough cube sawed and sanded with the blue eyes hammered in like nail heads. He could beat a mans brains out with his brow. That suits the Bond of ""Casino Royale"" who has only lately acquired his license to kill and like a kid whos just passed his driving test is eager to step on the gas. He will slay anyone if he so wishes and the news is that he does so wish and that he worries about the wishing--not enough to stop the killing although at one point he tenders his resignation to M (Judi Dench) but enough to make him wonder if hes fit for anything else. Craig has the courage to present a hollow man flooding the empty rooms where his better nature should be with brutality and threat. His smile is more frightening than his straight face and he doesnt bother with the throwaway quips that were meant to endear us to the other Bonds. The only thing he throws away is a set of car keys having borrowed a Range Rover and slammed it backward into a row of parked cars in order to set off their alarms. Calm down you want to tell him have a Martini; and so he does. ""Shaken or stirred?"" the barman inquires and Bond spits back at him ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" The plot unusually for a Bond picture leans heavily on the novel. Bond is up against Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who has a six-foot-tall mistress a weepy eye and nothing to cry about. His pleasure is gambling and his career as a banker takes him to selected trouble spots where he likes to meet the locals and help them with their plans for terrorism. What sets Le Chiffre apart from Bonds preceding nemeses is that he has absolutely no interest in running the planet preferring instead to profit nicely from its ruin. This is a welcome twist one of the pitiable things about the 007 franchise being its fixation on global conquest--a cheesy homage I often think to the ubiquity of the Bond brand itself. When Martin Campbell the director of ""Casino Royale"" made ""GoldenEye"" in 1995 the outcome was spirited enough but it also felt stupidly grand all wall-size computer screens and electromagnetic pulses fired from space. The new film has a leaner streak and the high-tech attack methods are as follows drowning your enemy in the washbasin of a mens room; throttling him in a hotel stairwell; and best of all chasing him through a construction site. This chase goes on far longer than expected like a theological discussion in a Bergman film with both the fleeing baddie and the pursuant Bond careening off walls and cranes and anything else that juts into their path. Rather than zipping through some customized hideout beneath the waves decked out with nuclear reactors and sharks they are merely making the best of their environment. Could this be something new in movies green violence? It looked pretty natural to me with Bond forever getting nicked and bruised. ""Casino Royale"" is allegedly the first 007 saga to feature rain and Craig is the first proper bleeder standing in front of a bathroom mirror and contemplating his own downpour. (Look how he swallows a Scotch to numb the hurt and then try to imagine the Roger Moore equivalent--the pensive sip the appreciative smile at the distillers art.) This is still Bond however so the next scene finds him sliding into his seat at the poker table in a bloodless white shirt; indeed if my math is correct he goes through three freshly ironed dress shirts in a single night which suggests that he has off-loaded Q in favor of a silent Jeeves. Also he has to look good for Vesper Lynd. Miss Lynd is an accountant employed by Her Majestys Government and just as ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" is said to have burnished the sales figures for Lotus sports cars so ""Casino Royale"" should transform accountancy into the most erotically charged of the professions. (There is one horrific attempt at product placement and I hereby propose an international ban on Omega watches.) Vesper is played by Eva Green who retains from her role in Bertoluccis ""The Dreamers"" an unnerving blend of the fleshly and the spectral and one thing she definitely is not is a Bond girl. Vesper is a Bond woman--a Bond Lady of Shalott I would say with all the sufferings of the world reflected in her dark-shadowed eyes. Her skin is paper-pale and her lips are vampirically red as if she hadnt slept in a hundred years although whatever has been keeping her awake it isnt sex. She is the only woman with whom 007 partakes of coitus uninterruptus and even that takes two hours to bring off. For a Bond picture ""Casino Royale"" is amazingly short on lust. There is a moment when our hero lands in the Bahamas and glances over his shoulder at a couple of flirters in tennis gear but Craig looks so embarrassed almost insulted by such levity that the experiment is never repeated. Bodies it would seem exist to be abused not caressed and Campbell takes care to incorporate straight from the novel a sequence in which Bond is denuded and tortured with particular attention being paid to his organs of desire. Poor fellow. If Pussy Galore showed up hed pour her a saucer of milk. Things have been so moribund for so long in the Bond business that it was always going to take some major defibrillation to jerk it back to life. ""Die Another Day"" the last film was a gruelling nadir although the producers would be right to point out that it earned four hundred and fifty million dollars which is three times the purse that Bond and Le Chiffre battle for at the tables. This means that the sight of Pierce Brosnan driving an invisible car though bound to dismay every Bond-revering adult was catnip to the larger constituency of teen-age boys who were comfortable with a film that felt like a video game. What they will make of ""Casino Royale""--no babes no toyland and the poker not even online--is anyones guess but the earnings of the new film will doubtless affect the look and the casting of the next. If Craig falters then I guess its full speed ahead to Chris Rock as 007 and Borat as Blofeld. That would be a shame because ""Casino Royale"" though half an hour too long is the first semi-serious stab at Fleming and at the treacherous terrain that he marked out since ""On Her Majestys Secret Service"" in 1969. Like that film this one ends in despair. To be precise it ends with Daniel Craig wearing a dark-blue three-piece suit and toting a machine gun which is the best though not the most cost-effective way to overcome despair that he can think of. The name Le Chiffre means ""the cipher"" but once the stage is bare it is Bond who remains the enigma--as unbreakable to the cryptographer as to the torturer and even to himself. Raymond Chandler once challenged Fleming in a letter saying ""I think you will have to make up your mind what kind of a writer you are going to be. You could be almost anything except that I think you are a bit of a sadist"" As with Fleming so with his creation the fledgling Bond of ""Casino Royale"" has yet to make up his mind what kind of a man he is going to be. The cruelty he can manage with ease; what he still lacks is the license to live. Hence the scene in which flush with winnings he shares a late supper with Vesper as if hoping to dine himself into being a gentleman. Even his grainy features are flattered by the soft lighting and savoring the mood he pays his companion a wooing compliment then blows it by adding ""I thought that was quite a good line."" Even James Bond in other words wants to be 007. Join the club.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

For once there is truth in advertising The credits proclaim Daniel Craig as ""Ian Flemings James Bond 007"" and Craig comes closer to the authors original conception of this exceptionally long-lived male fantasy figure than anyone since early Sean Connery. ""Casino Royale"" sees Bond recharged with fresh toughness and arrogance along with balancing hints of sadism and humanity just as the fabled series is reinvigorated by going back to basics. The Pierce Brosnan quartet set financial high-water marks for the franchise that may not be matched again but public curiosity lack of much high-octane action competition through the holiday season and the new films intrinsic excitement should nonetheless generate Bond-worthy revenue internationally. Bond made his debut in ""Casino Royale"" when it was published in 1953 and while the novel was adapted the following year for American television (Barry Nelson played Bond) and in 1967 became a lame all-star spy send-up featuring Peter Sellers David Niven and Woody Allen it remained unavailable to the Eon producers until now. As refashioned for this 21st series installment the novels focus on a high-stakes cards showdown doesnt kick in for an hour. But Craigs taking over as the sixth actor to officially portray the secret agent on the bigscreen (not including that first ""Casino"") provides a plausible opportunity to examine the characters promotion to double-0 status which is neatly done in a brutal black-and-white prologue in which he notches his first two kills. After the pic bleeds into color Bond pursues a would-be suicide bomber in a madly acrobatic chase through an African construction site at the end of which he happens to be filmed killing an apparently if not in fact unarmed man in images instantly disseminated on the Internet to the enormous embarrassment of MI6. Welcome to the 21st century Mr. Bond. Doubling the displeasure of his boss M (Judi Dench happily back for her fifth turn) by surreptitiously entering her flat Bond ignores her reprimand by high-tailing it to the Bahamas itself a nice throwback to the film series origins in ""Dr. No."" Following a cell phone trail of potential terrorist bombers Bond tracks one then another in Miami where an evening that begins at a ""Bodyworks"" exhibition ends with a high-speed tarmac battle in which the fate of the worlds biggest new jetliner hangs in the balance. Even by this early juncture the pic has emphatically announced its own personality. Its comparatively low-tech with the intense fights mostly conducted up close and personally the killings accomplished by hand or gun and without an invisible car in evidence; Bond is more of a lone wolf Craigs upper-body hunkiness and mildly squashed facial features giving him the air of a boxer; 007s got a frequently remarked upon ego which can cause him to recklessly overreach and botch things and the limited witticisms function naturally within the characters interchanges. As matters advance to the Continent elements even more unusual in the Bond world of late comprehensible plotting and palpable male-female frissons move to the fore. Bonds enemy is not a Mr. Evil type plotting world domination but a financier of international terrorism Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) who needs to make financial amends by winning a big-pot poker game at the casino in fictional Montenegro. Bond plans to break Le Chiffre for good at the gambling table and to this end he is fronted 10 million delivered by a most alluring messenger Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) assigned to keep tabs on the coin. Their initial meeting on board a Euro fast train fairly crackles with a sexual undercurrent as they perceptively size one another up. But Vesper intends to maintain a professional distance from her temporary colleague whose contest of wills and luck with Le Chiffre in the hushed confines of a private gaming room is repeatedly interrupted during breaks by spasms of violence and attempts on Bonds life. Yarn does tend to go on a bit once it sails past the two-hour mark but final stretch contains two indelible interludes crucial to defining this new incarnation of Bond. Constrained nude to a bottomed-out chair Bond is tortured by Le Chiffre who repeatedly launches a hard-tipped rope upon his nemesis most sensitive area and Craig once and for all claims the character as his own by virtue of the supreme defiance with which he taunts Le Chiffre even in vulnerable extremis. Later the startling tragic turn in Bonds relationship with Vesper provides a measure of understanding for his rake-like tendencies down the line. Script by series vets Neal Purvis and Robert Wade along with Paul Haggis hangs together reasonably well and is rewarded for its unaccustomed preoccupation with character by the attentiveness to same by director Martin Campbell back after having helmed the first Brosnan entry ""GoldenEye"" 11 years ago. Dialogue requires Bond to acknowledge his mistakes and reflect on the soul-killing nature of his job self-searching unimaginable in the more fanciful Bond universes inhabited by Brosnan and Roger Moore. Shrewd and smart as well as gorgeous Vesper Lynd is hardly the typical Bond girl (she never even appears in a bathing suit) and Green makes her an ideal match for Craigs Bond. Danish star Mikkelsen proves a fine heavy an imposing man with the memorable flaw of an injured eye that sometimes produces tears of blood. Giancarlo Giannini has a few understated scenes as a friendly contact in Montenegro and while Jeffrey Wright has little to do as CIA man Felix Leiter he does get off a couple of the films best lines and one can hope he may figure more prominently in forthcoming installments. Sebastien Foucan does some eyebrow-raising ""free running"" stunts in the African chase. ""Casino Royale"" is the first Bond in a while thats not over-produced and its better for it. Production values are all they need to be and while the score by David Arnold in his fourth Bond outing is very good the title song ""You Know My Name"" sung by Chris Cornell over disappointingly designed opening credits is a dud.
