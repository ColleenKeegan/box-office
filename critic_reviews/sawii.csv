The spring-loaded surprises never quite match the original but youll be kept awake by the stroboscopic images jagged sounds and incessant screaming. The challenge facing first-time writer-director Darren Lynn Bousman and his collaborator Leigh Whannell (co-creator and co-star of Saw) was how to get more mileage out of serial killer Jigsaws imprisoning of eight new victims in a single locked room. In fact a bigger budget means its an entire house. Theres even a returnee ex-junkie Amanda the sole survivor from Saw. As before none of the victims knows why they are there or what they have in common. In a neat twist Jigsaw is quickly apprehended by Detective Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg). As in Seven however this is merely how the trap is sprung. The cancer-ridden Jigsaw has locked the corrupt cops teenage son Daniel (Erik Knudsen) in a booby-trapped house with a bunch of criminals who Mathews previously sent down using false evidence. Soon the prisoners are ripping themselves and each other apart in their selfish efforts to escape. Meanwhile their prison is slowly filling with poison gas which will kill them in two hours. Saw II achieves a level of horror and cruelty - both physical and psychological - that is inventively modern and atavistically medieval.

Starring Donnie Wahlberg Tobin Bell Dina Meyer and Shawnee Smith. Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman. (Rated R. 91 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The people who thought up the plot to ""Saw II"" are much much sicker than you and me. Imagine that the Zodiac killer took over as executive producer of ""Fear Factor"" and you might understand the level of suffering in this movie -- which makes the typical Wes Craven film look like ""Its the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown ."" But as it was in the first ""Saw"" audiences are faced with insane leaps in logic that sabotage the last part of the film. This movie was a solid Little Man clapping until the final three minutes which are infected by a plot twist so frustrating that it would defy explanation even if we felt like giving the ending away. ""Saw II"" the sequel to last years surprise hit looks as if it got a bigger budget this time around. The cast however is more obscure with Cary Elwes and Danny Glover replaced by Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer. Even that creepy puppet in the first film gets little more than a cameo with approximately the same amount of screen time as Anthony Edwards in ""Revenge of the Nerds II."" Most of the money appears to have been spent on carnage and what better way to get value out of your slasher filmmaking dollar? Instead of focusing on a single bathroom the Jigsaw Killer has created an entire crack house of horrors for ""Saw II"" locking eight unfortunates in a trap-filled scenario from which they must use their heads -- and above all obey instructions -- to escape. The first half of ""Saw II"" is cleverly written with several twisted surprises that youve never seen before. The bad guy played with Hannibal Lecter intensity by Tobin Bell is more terrifying than the movie villains in Hollywoods last five horror films put together -- even though hes in a wheelchair and hooked up to multiple IVs. Wahlberg a long way from the New Kids on the Block also holds his own as a shady cop who has a very personal interest in solving the case. Basically this is a really good movie until the last part where director and co-writer Darren Lynn Bousman ruins so much so fast that youll wonder if his actions are deliberate -- or if the studio interfered. Its almost as if the makers of ""Saw II"" watched the last part of M. Night Shyamalans ""The Village"" sat down together and said ""That was a horrible ending. Now lets brew a big pot of coffee stay up all night and see if we can come up with something worse."" Theres a big twist that comes off totally false in a movie that already stretched its credibility to the brink in the first 88 minutes. It doesnt ruin ""Saw II"" which is still an above-average slasher film. But fans of this kind of movie should be able to enjoy the mayhem without feeling as if theyd been victimized themselves. -- Advisory Oh man where to start ... People constantly cough up blood in ""Saw II"" while still speaking clearly enough to utter a constant stream of profanity. This movie also contains severed limbs burning flesh intentional and forced drug use stabbings a shooting and massive head wounds. Whatever your ultimate nightmare death scenario is -- with the exception of shark attack and avian flu -- its probably in this movie. -- Peter Hartlaub G Drama. Starring Richard T. Jones Blair Underwood Chenoa Maxwell and Andre Royo. Directed by Christopher Scott Cherot. (Rated R. 96 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The movie ""G"" was filmed so long ago that the cars and even some of the fashions seem dated. The star Richard T. Jones has appeared in more than a dozen films and a few TV shows since ""G"" started making the festival circuit in 2002. But despite its unconventional path to wide release -- probably because of the lack of any huge stars -- its still a movie worth seeing. Loosely telling the story of ""The Great Gatsby"" using hip-hop musicians in the Hamptons ""G"" is an unpolished but entertaining tragedy filled with outstanding performances and memorable moments. Jones stars as Summer G a rap mogul whose methods of building his empire are in question. Hes still in love with Sky (Chenoa Maxwell) who is married to the duplicitous Chip (Blair Underwood). A dozen minor characters are introduced and most fit somehow into the main plot. But the pivotal role -- and by far best performance in the movie -- comes from Andre Royo an actor who has gone underappreciated for too long. Anyone who has seen Royos performance as the junkie informant in HBOs ""The Wire"" knows his ability to bring nuances and sympathy out of a hustler. As Tracy -- the Nick character in ""Gatsby"" -- Royo carefully balances his options as he lives with Chip yet starts to realize that Summer is a better option for his cousin Sky. ""G"" is tense and often funny but has a few technical problems. With more than three years from completion to wide release its a wonder no one could get the sound mixing right. Bill Conti provides a serviceable score but theres no doubt hes saving his best material for ""Rocky VI."" And ""Gatsby"" purists will be constantly frustrated by distracting changes in the story including an ending that has nowhere near the impact of the book. The Summer G character also seems a bit too sympathetic and Maxwell cant quite keep up with Underwood Jones and Royo as the drama unfolds. But ""G"" is worth discovery. It took more than 25 years for F. Scott Fitzgeralds book to become a hit -- maybe three years isnt such a long wait after all. -- Advisory This film contains profanity sex and a few scenes of violence. Students who want to watch ""G"" before a test instead of reading ""The Great Gatsby"" should be warned -- there are several changes from the book. The best youre going to get is a C-minus. -- Peter Hartlaub Kamikaze Girls Comedy. Starring Kyoko Fukada Anna Tsuchiya. Directed by Tetsuya Nakashima. In Japanese with English subtitles. (Not rated. 103 minutes. At the Lumiere.) Anyone whos seen a glimpse of Japanese television (even if it was only that hilarious send-up in ""Lost in Translation"") knows that the frenetic lunacy that passes for entertainment over there can be tough to describe. Japanese movies can be like that too. But Tetsuya Nakashimas ""Kamikaze Girls"" while being a silly freewheeling candy-colored lollapalooza is also a heartfelt tale of friendship. The novel upon which the film is based by Novala Takemoto became a pop-culture phenomenon in Japan. (The press notes inform us that Takemotos ""empathy with social outsiders and decadent fashion sense have helped cultivate a devoted following among young women particularly those in the Lolita fashion scene."") Indeed Momoko (pop idol Kyoko Fukada) is a high school girl who is decked out in the Lolita look -- doll-like series of outfits complete with parasol that are her version of her favorite fantasy land 18th century Versailles. A child of divorce Momoko moves from the big city to the painfully rural town of Shimotsuma. Momoko is content to live in her self-created world which excludes all others. That is until she encounters Ichiko (Anna Tsuchiya) a biker girl who dresses in the ""Yanki"" style. Ichiko whose girl biker gang is called the Ponytails buys knock-off designer clothes from Momoko and also forces her way into Momokos life. The two develop a friendship the strength of which surprises both of them -- and us. That such a seemingly frivolous movie filmed to approximate a girls comic book becomes even slightly touching is a testament to Nakashima. His shots even those of short duration are rigorously composed and he draws warmth from his two young leads. ""Kamikaze Girls"" is like ""Laverne and Shirley"" on acid. I think thats a compliment ... Advisory This film contains comic book violence. -- G. Allen Johnson Three ... Extremes Horror trilogy. Directed by Fruit Chan Park Chan-wook Takashi Miike. In Cantonese Korean and Japanese with English subtitles. (Rated R. 118 minutes. At the Galaxy.) Asian horror films have become one of the most influential genres in recent movie history -- theyve invaded the psyche of both Hollywood with its many remakes and the indie circuit. Like the American suspense and film noir genres of the 1940s and 50s the best and the brightest of directors in Asia will eventually make a horror flick. ""Three ... Extremes"" is an excellent chance for genre fans to see three top-notch directors playfully engaged but the results are mixed. One is haunting and wonderful one is very good and one spoils the fun. Hong Kongs ""Dumplings"" directed by art-house favorite Fruit Chan is an excellent film as a 90-minute feature (which is how it was released in Hong Kong) and a different but still accomplished work as a 45-minute short. More of a crude black comedy than a horror film it stars Miriam Yeung as an aging movie star who will do anything to recapture her lost youth and a mysterious woman (Bai Ling who won best supporting actress at the Hong Kong Film Awards for her work) is more than happy to help solve her problem. It is in the form of her special dumplings which have some stomach-churning ingredients. Although it is his first horror film Chan manages to imbue it with his own special sense of social commentary; probably no other director so acutely captures the ever-changing face of Hong Kong. Next up is a real downer -- Park Chan-wooks ""Cut"" another frustrating gross-out fest from the Korean director of ""Oldboy."" A film director (Lee Byung-hun) returns from a days work to find a spurned extra holding a child and the directors wife hostage. The directors choice Let the child be killed or watch as his wifes fingers are cut off one by one. Park is a supremely talented director and his stunning eye for visuals is again on display. But as in ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance"" Parks goal is to shock seemingly without purpose. Only in the terrific ""Oldboy"" has this filmmaker pulled it all together. The closing film ""Box"" is one of the simplest and best films made by Japanese bad boy Takashi Miike (""Audition"" ""Dead or Alive"" trilogy). A director prone to excess at all costs Takashi actually shows restraint and beautifully depicts the inner life of a successful novelist who has been hiding her involvement in the death of her twin sister when they were 10. Her sisters ghost is haunting -- or is it in her mind? ""Box"" opened ""Three ... Extremes"" in Asia but Lions Gate Films has flipped the order demoting ""Cut"" to the middle and rightfully placing ""Box"" at the end where Takashis moody apparition of a film can have the most emotional impact. -- Advisory This trilogy is loaded with violence and gruesome images. -- G. Allen Johnson Make It Funky Documentary. With Allen Toussaint Aaron Neville Art Neville the Dirty Dozen Brass Band the Funky Meters the Neville Brothers others. Produced and directed by Michael Murphy. (Not rated. 109 minutes. At the Roxie.) The timing couldnt be better for ""Make It Funky"" the concert documentary about New Orleans music that opens today at the Roxie Theater. As musicians walk through the streets of the Treme neighborhood it is impossible not to think about the floodwaters that swamped those very blocks only weeks ago. Shot at an April 2004 all-star concert and narrated by the estimable Art Neville of the Neville Brothers ""Make It Funky"" encapsulates the story of New Orleans rhythm and blues moving on and off the stage at Saenger Theatre in New Orleans to tour the city and have people like Neville songwriter Allen Toussaint recording engineer Cosimo Matassa and drummer Earl Palmer recite the lore. Nevilles informal interviews in fact are much more poignant and pointed than the often syrupy narration he reads. ""Growing up in England"" says Keith Richards one of the few outsiders invited to participate along with Bonnie Raitt ""you wouldnt be able to tell from any other record but you always knew when a record was from New Orleans."" The cameras travel through a city that has now disappeared and record the musical culture that has now been scattered to the winds. Cyril Neville who is interviewed extensively in the film has moved to Austin Texas and says he has no intention of returning to New Orleans. His brothers Art and Aaron the elder brothers of New Orleans first family of funk live in Nashville. But with the steady hand of the courtly Toussaint guiding the band ""Make It Funky"" pieces together the history of New Orleans Ramp;B -- from Lloyd Price singing ""Lawdy Miss Clawdy"" to the rich syncopated sound of Art Nevilles other group the Meters. Although the exploits of such New Orleans luminaries as Fats Domino Professor Longhair Little Richard and others are extolled at length it is the live performances from the Saenger that light up the screen time and time again; Toussaint backing Irma Thomas on ""Old Records"" Walter ""Wolfman"" Washington picking out a guitar solo with his teeth on Robert Parkers ""Barefootin"" and the little-known 69-year-old blues singer Snooks Eaglin who plucks some sure-enough funky guitar on the Earl King number ""Come On."" The love people have for this city just comes tumbling out of every part of this movie from outsiders like Richards and Raitt or pianist Jon Cleary a British expatriate who moved to New Orleans to study at the feet of the masters to disc jockey Jim Russell a homegrown hero who dared to play the black musicians records on the radio a radical act he performed simply because he loved the music so much. And its important to remember that there was indeed a time not very long ago when to play a Fats Domino record on the radio was highly subversive in the segregated South. From the triple trumpet challenge that opens the film featuring horn men Kermit Ruffins Irvin Mayfield and Troy Andrews to the jam-packed finale the brilliant colors the vibrant flavors and sultry seductive rhythms of New Orleans music serve to remind us how unique beautiful and valuable the city and its heritage are to all of us in this country. The entire run of the film at the Roxie will serve as a benefit for Louisiana Rebirth (Restoring the Soul of America). -- Joel Selvin Todays Deals KitchenAid Small Kitchen Appliances at eBay Up to 51% off +...

"Suspenseless Saw II lacks predecessors edge - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW Suspenseless Saw II lacks predecessors edge By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  October 28 2005 This is the story of eight strangers picked to live in a house have their lives taped and find out what happens when people stop being polite and start being real.No this is not another season of The Real World"" its the second installment of Saw."" Indeed a year after the debut of the first movie Saw II"" reunites us with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) the cancer patient with the passive-aggressive approach to serial killing (his victims kill one another.) Here hes locked some folks in a big dank booby-trapped shelter where hes left them clues and riddles they must follow and solve in order to survive his medieval tortures. Needless to say Saw II"" is not for the faint of heart. Its for the foolish of wallet.The victims have something in common although it takes forever for them to figure out what. Theyre given two hours. After that the poison gas thats streaming out the air vents will have corroded their insides. So following instructions is crucial. The first victim disobeys that order about not unlocking a door and promptly has the back of his head blown out.At one point the film takes a break from the bloodletting inside the house to give us a police procedural. In the name of reality TV Jigsaw and the cops watch the action on surveillance monitors. Donnie Wahlberg plays the detective on the case and the estranged father of one of the contestants. He looks tired and mad as hell Where is his son? But those old-school rogue-cop methods of his wont get him far with Jigsaw. As one SWAT commando remarks the detective has to start thinking outside the box or his sons gonna be in one."" Word.This all makes for dreadful moviegoing even on Halloween. Its not that the acting is bad -- except for Dina Meyer as the other detective and Frankie G as one of the most annoying horror victims in the genres history. Its that theres little fun in watching a girl fish for a key in a pit of hypodermic needles -- even if she used to be a junkie.The first Saw"" offered mounting existential dread two strangers woke up in a foul washroom and had to hack each other up. It was Jean-Paul Sartres No Exit"" by way of the grindhouse. It wasnt good but it occasionally delivered the visceral terror we want from a horror movie. The sequel sheds both philosophy and suspense.Darren Lynn Bousman and Leigh Whannell wrote Saw II"" which Bousman directed. They arent yet 30 and Whannell who also wrote and acted in the first movie looks particularly fresh-faced in his publicity photos. Accordingly his movie is the product of immaturity. It approaches suffering with a meaninglessness that must be a luxury for anyone who has never lost anyone or is incapable of empathizing with someone who has.

Browse over 8 million products  Clothing amp; Jewelry  Computers amp; Electronics  Home amp; Garden  Kids amp; Family Rotten any way you slice itBy Mike Clark USA TODAY Saw II is a sequel to last Octobers Saw which was the old saw about a chained-up victim being forced to saw off his limb as a trade-off against suffering even more. Just try to get out of this one Michael (Noam Jenkins) finds himself in a tough spot. Lions Gate Films Filmed for what appeared to be a handful of coins or maybe Necco Wafers the original grossed 55 million domestically and just over 100 worldwide. Given its blood-dripping status as an uncommonly sadistic ""hard-R"" this means that most of the people who paid to see it were older than the 15-year-old boys who keep a lot of screen junk in business. This equally gruesome follow-up has similarities -- and some differences. Back are the same eyesore-ish photographic tints (green-and-tan skin tones) that look like the most cut-rate colorization. And though the set allows for more room-to-room roaming by victims it reminds me of how many years ago someone described the production design of a cheesy sci-fi film ""a cave and a folding chair."" About the movie Saw II  1/2 (out of four) Stars Tobin Bell Donnie Wahlberg Dina Meyer Shawnee Smith Erik Knudsen Director Darren Lynn Bousman Distributor Lions Gate Rating R for grisly violence and gore terror language and drug content Running time 1 hour 31 minutes Opens Friday nationwide But Saw II differs by trying to half-humanize string-pulling ghoul Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) who has abducted and imprisoned a demographically diverse band of stereotypes (female junkie sullen teen guy in a tie guy in a muscle shirt) as part of what he calls ""his work."" Jigsaw is the kind of guy youd expect to result from Hannibal Lecter taking part in the Big Brothers program. The cancer-ridden villain has the perspective to think he should torture his guests into appreciating the lives they once led. Thanks. Heavily involved in a tandem plot line is a dirty cop (Donnie Wahlberg) who is father to one of the victims. But essentially this is one more movie that regardless of its setting or even planet exists to knock off its cast members one by one. Gee we havent seen this one since last weeks Doom. And if this movie is inferior to Doom which was inferior to Januarys remake of Assault on Precinct 13 which was inferior to the Assault original ... well where are we in the food chain? Even by genre standards this one is grueling a guy digs into his eye socket to retrieve a key implanted there a woman flails in a pit of dirty syringes. Whether were talking this go-round the original or the second sequel the finale seems to promise Id rather try standing drunk on a see-saw (though maybe not over dirty syringes) than see Saw.

""Saw II"" directed by a newcomer Darren Lynn Bousman delivers similar hard-core practically humorless frights and hair-raising tension but only after getting past a shaky beginning that plays more like a forensics-themed television show than a scary movie.This time Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) who is revealed early on to be a cancer-stricken sicko with a twistedly noble purpose is placed under house arrest though he remains very much in control of the police who work to uncover the whereabouts of the eight latest ""contestants"" who are being forced to play Jigsaws signature life-or-death games.Through some crafty editing the action cuts back and forth between Jigsaws headquarters and the house of horror where the group members - who include the tough-as-nails Amanda (Shawnee Smith) the sole character from ""Saw"" to make it to Round 2 and the young son of Detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) - face intricate booby traps and poisonous gas and their own increasingly violent actions in order to survive.By the time the final twists start exposing themselves and the title tool makes a welcome cameo appearance its fully apparent that this sequel is more trick than treat and doesnt really compare to its fine predecessor - though it still manages to be eye-opening (and sometimes positively nauseating) in itself.""Saw II"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has extreme language violence and gore.Saw IIOpens today nationwide.Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman; written by Mr. Bousman and Leigh Whannell; director of photography David Armstrong; edited by Kevin Greutert; production designer David Hackl; produced by Mark Burg Gregg Hoffman and Oren Koules; released by Lions Gate Films.

Directed by Darren Lynn Bousman from a screenplay by Bousman and Leigh Whannell. 91 minutes. Rated R for strong violence drug use language and sexuality. Several theaters. In the current issue of the horror-buff magazine Fangoria the producers of the fast-buck sequel ""Saw II"" proudly proclaim that they ""read and responded"" to Internet chatter from splatter fans who begged for answers to questions left tantalizingly unanswered in ""Saw"" the surprise box-office hit released just one day shy of a year ago. Its bad enough that catering to ones audience is antithetical to original filmmaking but ""Saw II"" isnt even originally unoriginal. The producers were in such a hurry to capitalize on their hit (while claiming they were ""on the fence"" about a sequel) that they co-opted Darren Lynn Bousmans already-written screenplay titled ""The Desperate"" recruited ""Saw"" co-writer Leigh Whannell for a quick makeover and hired Bousman (with a background in commercials and music videos) as ""Saw IIs"" first-time director. Is it any surprise that the result is a gawd-awful mess? Its bigger and bloodier and fans may appreciate the revelation of the ""Jigsaw"" killers backstory and sadistic motivation. But youll be hard-pressed to find a shred of the perverse ingenuity that made ""Saw"" so effectively unnerving. As Jigsaw the cancer-stricken killer who creates elaborate Rube Goldberg devices that his tormented victims must escape from or meet horribly violent deaths Tobin Bell creepily compensates for the fact that he spent most of ""Saw"" face down on a cold tile floor. Here Jigsaws latest death game involves a corrupt and hot-tempered cop named Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg struggling to dignify a one-note role) whose estranged son is held captive in a booby-trapped crack house with seven other people. If they dont escape from Jigsaws deadly contraptions within two hours a sarinlike nerve gas will cause them to ""bleed from every orifice."" It takes a full hour before Matthews partner (Dina Meyer returning from ""Saw"") says ""I know how this guy works"" and even then she ignores advice to ""think outside the box"" resulting in inept police work while Jigsaws prisoners yell and panic killing each other or dying by idiotically falling into Jigsaws traps. ""There will be blood"" warns Jigsaw and so there is. Yawn-inducing puddles of it the inevitable outcome of dim-witted characters following the contrived rules of a mock-clever screenplay. With no memorable roles to play the cast compensates with extreme overacting. Pity them its not their fault. There are some arbitrary connections to ""Saw"" in the third act and there is of course a twist which wont be spoiled here for the benefit of those who will probably make ""Saw II"" this weekends No. 1 box-office hit. Come Halloween Monday however even die-hard ""Saw"" fans will feel more tricked than treated but that wont earn them a refund.

Neither would the poor fella in the first frazzled minutes of Saw II a sequel that delivers another round of the kind of elaborate Rube Goldberg shocks that made the first movie a surprise hit last year. The contest is close but Saw II is just barely a better B flick than Saw. It wins by a hair wire thinner than the one that trips the blades that slice off a blindsided SWAT guys feet. The killer of the series remains Jigsaw a sicko with engineering capabilities limited only by how far the new set of screenwriters is willing to beggar belief. In the first film he was mostly unseen represented by a bulbous papier-mache-type puppet with red swirlies painted on its cheeks -- that is until a last-second reveal that felt like one of the biggest ""whatever"" gyps in surprise-ending cinema. This time the puppet cameos early on and then kindly takes a powder. As the droopy-lidded maniac in the flesh Tobin Bell is for all the films gewgaws Saw IIs sturdiest horror a Terence Stamp look-alike who calls to mind a seedy General Zod lazily overseeing the universe from his evildoers lair. Jigsaws grand plan involves sticking eight people in a cavernous dilapidated old house and having them kill scream and reason their way out of his booby traps as if this were a hard-edged sequel to The Goonies. In the meantime Jig volleys face-to-face with a conflicted cop whose teen son is among those lost in the deadly fun house. The cop is played by Donnie Wahlberg whos overshadowed by Bell but its Jigsaws franchise so thats probably the point. Where Saw II lags behind in Saws novelty it takes the lead with its smoother landing which is again primed to blow the movie wide open but manages a more compelling job of it than the originals cheat finish. Yet the nagging thing about both movies is that theyre more clever and revolting -- first hitting on the nervy idea of an open grave of a thousand syringes for example and then chucking a character down into it so we can watch her writhe -- than they are actually chilling.

Cooking up new Rube Goldberg torture contraptions isnt enough to get ""Saw II"" out of the shadow of its unnerving predecessor. The notion of victims killing themselves while trying to get free from traps set by an evil genius took ""Saw"" beyond cult hit status to 100 million in worldwide B.O. but new pic lets the air out by divulging the startling mystery that concluded the original. Add this to problematic juggling of police procedural and group-in-distress storylines and Lions Gate has what looks like a sequel rushed for Halloween. Nonetheless fans will pile in and come back for more followed by killer ancillary biz. Pre-title shocker sets the table with a police informer (Noam Jenkins) trapped in a grungy room with a venus-flytrap-type metal device locked around his neck and the key to open it lodged behind one of his eye sockets. Nasty results cue that this will be as pics promotion insists bloodier than before. Knowing the trademark of master sadist Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) Det. Kerry (Dina Meyer) immediately recognizes his handiwork when she surveys the informants horrific demise and warns her partner Eric (Donnie Wahlberg). As Kerry and Eric along with the S.W.A.T. team track Jigsaw down to his lab in a factory -- while stumbling onto one of his patented torture-tripwire devices along the way-they think the case is wrapped up. But they find a new dilemma On a lab video console the cops can see that nine people -- including Erics son Daniel (Erik Knudsen) -- are trapped together in a room. The jig is far from up for Jigsaw. While ""Saw"" dropped viewers into a puzzling setting that the chained victims gradually made sense of through flashbacks ""Saw II"" strides down what appears to be a straight narrative line but is nevertheless bogged down in various genre traps of its own. On one end the interrogation of the cancer-ridden but devious Jigsaw grows surprisingly tiresome as Erics rage as a father is played in distressingly one-note fashion by Wahlberg. On the other the victims turn out to be a bunch of screamers and hagglers who are barely distinguishable from one another led by the dull machismo of drug dealer Xavier (Freddy G) and the smarts of Amanda (Shawnee Smith) back for more torture after she escaped a bear-trap in previous pic. Bell afforded here a far larger speaking role than in the first pic suggests in his deep scratchy voice bird-like visage and piercing eyes what his version of Hannibal Lecter could be. He even builds up some sympathy for his madman but this is delivered by way of a time-consuming backstory. What was delectably mysterious in ""Saw"" is now made literal and the revelations arent terribly intriguing. Erics lesson it appears is that he must pay for planting evidence and being a bad dad but it all seems a tad out of proportion. Under first-timer Darren Lynn Bousmans direction the pace slackens during an overlong chase scene lessening the impact of what was meant to be a stunner of a closing twist. Ending images make no doubt that a new set of ""Saws"" will be rolling off of the assembly line. Original key crew is intact giving pic an entirely consistent look and sound distinguished by lenser David A. Armstrongs talent for flat overhead light that eliminates shadows. In a case of what looks like a jumpy trigger finger at the Avid editor Kevin Greuterts cutting is frantic to a completely distracting level.
