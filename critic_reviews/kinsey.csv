Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Feb. 18 2011 1201 a.m. ET Lurking behind the lunatic car chases the preposterous plot turns and the paranoid gloom of ""Unknown"" is a grandiose plan to end world hunger with a new strain of corn that can grow in any climate. This botched thriller is an old strain of corn that does best in a climate of stupefaction. It mixes and mismatches jagged fragments of Jason Bourne Alfred Hitchcock ""Total Recall"" and Mel Gibsons underappreciated ""Conspiracy Theory"" although underappreciation isnt a risk for a movie that amounts to ""The Stillbourne Identity."" The setting is Berlin. Liam Neeson is Dr. Martin Harris an American scientist who accompanied by his loving wife has come to attend a biotech conference. Or is he Martin Harris? After four days in a coma following a grotesquely overproduced accident--the whole film is grotesquely overproduced--Martin wakes up to find that his wife nicely played by January Jones doesnt know him and another man has taken over his identity. (The other Martin played by Aidan Quinn isnt as gloomy as Mr. Neesons Martin; hes just dull.) Theres an intriguing idea here What good is a sense of self if no one else acknowledges it? What good is an idea though if its undercut by bad writing--starting with a flagrantly implausible decision Martin makes while he and his wife are checking in at the Hotel Adlon--and trampled by rampant action sequences that play like a demo reel from a special-effects house? ENLARGE Liam Neeson as Martin Harris--maybe--in Unknown. Warner Bros. Pictures Those sequences take a terrible toll on Berlins taxis. Three of them all late-model Mercedes sedans are totaled in the course of accidents or chases that evoke another Mel Gibson movie ""Mad Max"" except that this time the driving is done either by Martin who specializes in hurtling backward at warp speed or by Diane Krugers Gina a beautiful but illegal Bosnian immigrant who works as a waitress when she isnt moonlighting behind the wheel of a cab like a Grand Prix champion in mufti. Bruno Ganz who plays an ex-Stasi secret cop looks even sadder than he did two decades ago as an angel surveying Berlin in ""Wings of Desire."" The script takes a worse toll on logic. One of the high points of its silliness comes when Martin--our Martin not the other guy--tracks Gina down after theyve shared a near-death experience then neglects to ask any searching questions about the event. Instead of Martin its the writers who seem to be suffering from amnesia. (For the record Oliver Butcher and Stephen Cornwell --the son of John Le Carre--adapted their screenplay from a novel by Didier Van Cauwelaert. The director was Jaume Collet-Serra.) This is one of those movies in which important questions dont get asked and important things dont get said because the filmmakers arent interested in the give and take of real conversation; mainly they use their characters to tick off plot points set up situations or plunge themselves into predicaments and logic be damned. On the other hand all of the nonsense piled on nonsense does provide some measure of pleasure. ""Unknown"" gets better by getting worse. Even the Rain Watch a clip from Even the Rain about a director and his crew shooting a controversial film about Christopher Columbus in Bolivia. While shooting they encounter local people rising up against plans to privatize the water supply. Deeply felt convictions and first-rate craftsmanship--craftswomanship in the case of the Spanish director Iciar Bollain--win out over contrivance in this parallel drama of exploitation in the New World discovered by Columbus and in the Bolivia of 2000. (The film in Spanish with English subtitles is dedicated to the radical historian Howard Zinn.) Paul Lavertys script centers on a movie company that comes to Bolivia from Madrid to shoot a period piece about Columbus and the Spanish Crown exploiting indigenous people for gold. The filmmakers arent there in the interests of historical accuracy Columbuss first landfall was thousands of miles away. Theyve chosen their location so they can work on the cheap with plenty of extras who are willing to accept a pittance. Thats one parallel. Another is the exploitation thats going on in the vicinity of the film shoot--not for gold but for sources of water being privatized by multinational companies. Yes the parallels are awfully convenient and the political sympathies of ""Even the Rain"" are unabashedly left--peaceful demonstrations over water rights are met by such violent government repression that the filmmakers find themselves in the midst of a civil war. Still theres more to the movie than radical politics. A personal though also polemical conflict emerges between two interesting characters played by strong actors Costa (Luis Tosar) the cynical producer of the movie within the movie and his director Sebastian (Gael Garcia Bernal) the productions guiding spirit. A third character Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri) is more interesting still. Short bandy-legged and remarkably intense Daniel plays Hatuey the leader of the resistance against Columbus and the first Indian to be burned on a cross as well as the firebrand leader of the Bolivian resistance against the water privateers. ENLARGE Gael Garcia Bernal as a director in Even the Rain. Moreno Films Early in the film Alex Catalans camera tilts up to discover a crucifix swinging below the helicopter transporting it as a prop to a nearby location. Those familiar with the films of Federico Fellini will associate the shot with the statue of Christ swinging beneath a helicopter in the opening of ""La Dolce Vita."" ""Even the Rain"" does have its pretensions along with its ambitions but it also illustrates films power. Time and contrivance fall away when an excellent actor named Raul Arevalo rehearses the role of the Dominican monk Father Montesinos who denounced from the pulpit the abuses of crown and church alike. ""I am a voice crying in the wilderness"" Father Montesinos says echoing John the Baptist. Suddenly the New World wilderness seems present and the priests anguished voice rings with urgency. The Last Lions One thing is certain about Dereck Jouberts documentary account of Africas dwindling lion population. The cinematography--by the writer-director--is seldom less than stunning. A lioness stalks water buffalo in slow motion her muscles a study in rippling rhythm but her prominent ribs a symptom of insufficient food. A pride of lions plunges into a river. Lightning splits a purple sky sparking fires on a vast savannah. Whats much less certain is the integrity of the narration mournfully intoned by Jeremy Irons and constantly at war with the authenticity of the images. ENLARGE A scene from The Last Lions. National Geographic Films ""The Last Lions"" a National Geographic production shot for the most part on Duba Island in Botswanas Okavango Delta tells the story of a lioness named Ma di Tau--Mother of Lions--who struggles to protect her cubs while finding enough food to keep herself strong. The film is billed as a real-life saga but how real is real? Giving animals names--Ma di Taus nemesis is a half-blind lion named Silver Eye--may be a harmless dramatic device. But ones confidence in factuality is weakened by a cliche-ridden narrative (""Tonight the bush is uneasy"") that reads Ma di Taus mind during her buffalo hunt (""She seems to understand that the herd will provide if she can just crack that code"") and by incessant manipulation of the imagery--not only the use and abuse of slo-mo but digital enhancement of colors in concert with an almost obsessive concentration on stalking and killing. By the same token the production notes tell us that the director and his wife Beverly Joubert--she was one of the films producers--have lived among the lions of the region for seven years and know every lion on Duba Island as well as they know the members of their own family. Maybe the filmmakers actually tracked the real-life saga of their desperate heroine and her imperiled cubs rather than assembled a semifictional story from extensive footage. If so knowing that they did would make a strong film even stronger. If not knowing how much of the film was fiction would underscore the awful fact that Africas lion population has declined to less than 20000 from 450000 in just the past 50 years. DVD FOCUS Kinsey (2004) ENLARGE Liam Neeson is the sex researcher Alfred Kinsey in this fascinating film by Bill Condon. Mr. Neeson has never had a richer character to play on screen-- including his landmark role in ""Schindlers List""--and has seldom displayed such formidable energy and virtuosity. His Kinsey is a huge figure whether in his prime or stooped by defeat and illness. And hes a stirring one whether railing against his critics obsessing grimly about his work or in a sweetly sentimental coda luxuriating in the beauty of a forest with his wife Clara McMillen whos played brilliantly by Laura Linney. Y Tu Mama Tambien (2001) Gael Garcia Bernal had a breakout role as the libidinous 17-year-old goofball Julio an ardent exponent of working-class decadence in Alfonso Cuarons raunchy Spanish-language road movie set in Mexico. Julios traveling companions are Tenoch (Diego Luna) a rich kid from a family that hobnobs with the nations president and the somewhat older Luisa (Maribel Verdu) a beautiful creature of mercurial moods and variable maturity who is married not happily to one of Tenochs cousins. This glorious film locates its characters buried feelings puts their hedonism in historical context speaks of Mexicos tragic past and glimpses its chancy but hopeful future. Grizzly Man (2005) Nature documentaries dont have to be pure fact or pure fiction to be valuable. Werner Herzog fashioned this even-handed film using footage shot by Timothy Treadwell a self-styled amateur grizzly-bear expert who spent 13 summers studying the creatures in Alaskas wilderness until 2003 when one bear killed him and his girlfriend. The film poses more questions than it answers; accordingly it has a haunting afterglow The subject turns out to be neither grizzly bears nor the lonely and tortured Mr. Treadwell who battled a taste for drugs and alcohol but the power of human obsession and self-delusion. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming GDP Expands at Disappointing 1.2% Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

That raises the question of where scientific study loses its detachment and becomes itself an agent of change and certainly the countrys conservatives - the forces of chastity as he has it here - have made much of supposed failings in both Kinseys professional methodology and his personal predilections accusing him of not only legitimising but also practising and inciting the diversity he claimed merely to record. Lifes one irreducible fact he called it drawing on his training as a student of gall wasps. Bill Condons biopic plays up that breach between the doctors less than dispassionate interest in his subject - he encouraged partner-swapping among his research team and vexed his funders by documenting on film various forms of sex in his own attic - and his lab-coated aloofness from its emotional cargo adhering to a just the physiognomy maam line of enquiry. Its rich material and of far from merely historical interest particularly as the Christian right continues to mobilise. The shame is that the film doesnt convey more mess or danger; its sex and its politics are almost entirely dinner-table-friendly. Leading man Liam Neeson Laura Linney as Kinseys faithful missus and the rest of the cast are all eminently charismatic but only Peter Sarsgaard ever communicates any uncontained pain. Condons script especially is airlessly neat with pointers contrasts and parallels; it never breaks out of the box.

But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

Kinsey was Americas boogeyman He peeked under the nations petticoats eavesdropped in bedrooms taking notes the whole time and exposing us for being -- gasp -- libidinous beings whose carnal tastes werent confined to mere procreation. He exposed us and he did it in the name of Science. Kinsey may have been a buttoned-up zoologist with a mountain of research to back up his findings but he was also a freakazoid of major proportions He encouraged even demanded open marriage among his underlings frequented bathhouses had affairs with men and filmed himself having sex with some of his subjects (his wife changed the sheets and served refreshments). He died in 1956 but Kinsey remains a controversial figure a man over whose life biographers still bicker. Today Kinsey is hot T.C. Boyles latest novel fictionalizes Kinseys life. The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex Gender and Reproduction at Indiana University lives on. And now theres the movie ""Kinsey"" starring Liam Neeson Laura Linney and Peter Sarsgaard and filled with celebrity cameos. As wife Mac Laura Linney discovers her own sexuality while standing by her man Liam Neeson as Alfred Kinsey.

For all its explosive material this is a fairly straightforward telling. Condons instinct to underplay is on target; this isnt a story that needs a lot of embellishment. Still theres a flatness to the filmmaking; whats needed here is a lot more va-va in its va-va-voom. Told mostly in flashbacks interspersed with black-and-white ""interviews"" done in extreme close-up this is a story without your classic narrative arc i.e. hero encounters conflict overcomes conflict becomes changed by said conflict. So the hurdle Kinsey faces two-thirds of the way through the picture is too little too late. Even once he discovers the joys of sex he doesnt change much. Kinsey doesnt grow as a character so much as he mutates. So without these classic elements to shape the story its up to Neeson to carry the film. And carry it he does. Indeed it is Neesons forceful performance -- not to mention the titillating subject matter -- that kidnaps the imagination handcuffs it and drags it through the films somewhat flat conclusion. Heavy-browed and earnest bow-tied and bumbling Neesons Kinsey is an awkward sort a social maladroit more at home dissecting the mating habits of gall wasps than in pitching woo with female hominids. The movie of course provides a reason for this. He had your basic Hollywoodesque hellish childhood Wimpy mom; punishing preacher dad who believed that everything modern man created from electricity to telephones to zippers was the handiwork of Satan. Kinsey remains a virgin until well after his wedding night when he and Mac (Linney) his first and only love have considerable trouble doing the do. A quick -- and exceedingly funny -- trip to the family doctor reveals the source of the problem and theyre suddenly swinging in places they never knew they could swing from. Theirs is a love story for grown-ups sweet tender troubled and yet enduring. Linney wrestling with a thinly written part evokes a tsunami of emotion in a look and a gesture bringing bright colors to a brown wren of a woman who discovers her own voracious sexuality while standing by her man even as her man gets increasingly freaky in the sack. About the sack part This is above all a film about sex and the depiction of sex is at times graphic. Theres full-frontal male nudity; close-ups of aroused genitalia; threesomes filmed in black and white. But sex should not be confused with sexy. Forget about eroticism. Therein lies Kinseys greatest shortcomings. He embraced sex with the fervor of a clinician never quite coming to terms with the complexity of emotions and romantic entanglements. Kinsey (118 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for pervasive sexual content including some graphic images and descriptions.

Its an alert lively movie with a crackling performance by Liam Neeson as Alfred Kinsey -- the sexual behavior scientist whose ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" and ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Female"" ignited a firestorm of controversy in the postwar years. Even today Kinseys findings attract heated excoriation from conservative groups who see a direct connection between the researchers findings and a number of perceived social outrages including government-funded sexual education encouragement of masturbation and premarital sexual experimentation free-and-easy condom dispensation and societys increasing acceptance of homosexuality. And recently the Concerned Women for America has taken on ""Kinsey"" for not showing that Kinsey also interviewed pedophiles and concluded from those conversations that children can be sexual at extremely early ages. This subject is nowhere to be found in the movie. Liam Neeson in ""Kinsey"" which explores the life and psyche of the pioneering sex researcher. _____More in Movies_____  Kinsey Details""  Watch the Trailer  View More Trailers  Transcript Online Discussion With Director Bill Condon  Current Movie Openings  Arts amp; Living Movies _____Desson Thomson_____  More Reviews  Live Online Behind the Screen  Arts amp; Living Movies Free E-mail Newsletters Washington Entertainment GuideSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now MoviesSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now TravelSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now At HomeSee a Sample  |  Sign Up Now What can be found in ""Kinsey"" is a convincing picture of an America semiconsciously cowered in fear and ignorance about sexuality. In the 1940s Indiana University biology professor Kinsey comes to realize that only single-minded zeal can break down these inhibitions and irrationality. He learns this after a series of experiences a life spent with a sanctimonious priggish father (John Lithgow); such prohibitive literature as the Boy Scouts handbook; and an uncomfortable dissatisfying first night with his new bride Clara McMillen (Laura Linney). In a world where masturbation and homosexuality are considered the road straight to damnation where some believe oral sex can lead to pregnancy and where even ""normal"" sexual relations between husband and wife are fraught with doubt inexperience and lack of creativity Kinsey finds his true calling. He must help everyone somehow. But what can he do? His experience consists of 20 years of bookish academe including a tome or two about the mysteries of the gall wasp. Hes a bug geek. Kinsey starts with a course about sexuality in marriage. Its an enormously popular class because of Kinseys scientific forthrightness not to mention graphic pictures and slides. Buoyed by his success Kinsey secures the moral support of his university president (Oliver Platt) and funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and embarks on a study of mens sexual habits. It takes years of brutally frank one-on-one conversations. But with the help of dedicated assistants including Clyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard) Paul Gebhard (Timothy Hutton) and Wardell Pomeroy (Chris ODonnell) Kinsey completes the study ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male."" Its a cultural breakthrough People are suddenly asked to reassess themselves in sexual even zoological terms. Predictably the book (and its follow-up on female sexuality) triggers controversy from moral conservatives. There is pressure on the university and the Rockefeller Foundation to withdraw support and very soon Kinsey finds himself a pariah in many circles. He spends his last years before his death in 1956 still dedicated to his work desperately seeking more funding. While hes advocating freshness freedom and sense in the public arena Kinsey is mired in moral questions at home. He explores his homosexual side with one of his assistants much to the shock of Clara and he encourages sexual experimentation among his followers. Is he the liberated man he asks others to be? What exactly is liberation? Kinsey finds himself caught in the endless conundrum of life. Writer-director Bill Condon who made the underappreciated ""Gods and Monsters"" has created a supple potent work that advocates the kind of compassion and diversity that in some corners of society remain as marginalized as they were in the 1940s. Its an important work bigger than the story it tells. Linney is affecting as Kinseys wife deeply in love with him but having to deal with the tyranny of his mission. This film closes a great year for the actress; she was equally persuasive in the movie ""P.S."" As Kinsey Neesons as memorable as he was playing Oskar Schindler in ""Schindlers List."" Like Schindler hes a loner who learns how to influence society by applying its own methods (in this case scientific study with foundation funding and university support) to change things from within. Large-framed and sporting an almost comical spike of hair he makes a compelling soft-eyed giant. Hes a pioneer of sorts completely dedicated to the task of smashing his head against the Puritan wall until something gives. In ""Kinsey"" he dislodges enough bricks for a piercing shaft of light to break through. As this movie shows were still squinting in that brightness today. KINSEY (R 118 minutes) -- Contains pervasive sexual content including nudity sexual scenes graphic images and frank discussion of sexual behavior. Area theaters.

Its the biography of a sex pioneer disguised as a love story or a romance with some rather intriguing side issues and it begins with one of cinemas more intriguing pickup lines ""Ive been reading up on gall wasps."" Liam Neeson his imposing height made greater by the addition of Kinseys electric-shock hair uses a slightly husky precise voice to play this man of science who speaks like a thoughtful newscaster. Hes a professor of biology at Indiana University specializing in the aforementioned gall wasps when he meets and marries a student Clara McMillen (Laura Linney). She calls him Prok (the students abbreviation for ""Professor Kinsey"") he calls her Mac and it seems like a match made in data-geek heaven -- even though the wedding night isnt exactly paradise. Movie review Showtimes and trailer  ""Kinsey"" with Liam Neeson Laura Linney Chris ODonnell Peter Sarsgaard Timothy Hutton John Lithgow Tim Curry Oliver Platt Dylan Baker. Written and directed by Bill Condon. 118 minutes. Rated R for pervasive sexual content including some graphic images and descriptions. Egyptian. Flash-forward a bit and Kinseys academic interest in sex has become piqued Humans he notes are just bigger slightly more complicated gall wasps. Married students begin to come to him with hesitant questions and hes appalled by their lack of knowledge -- theyve been taught he thunders ""morality disguised as fact."" (Tim Curry amusingly cast as an unsubtly ignorant hygiene teacher skulks about giving bad advice.) Research begins a team is assembled a groundbreaking book is written -- and with the publication of ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" in 1948 the way America talked about sex began to change. Condon the talented writer/director of ""Gods and Monsters"" (which also chronicled a real person -- director James Whale -- of whom our memory is now faded) frames his story with a number of one-on-one interviews intended to convey the strange mixture of clinical distance and intimacy that Kinsey and his team employed. ""Lets get back to masturbation"" intones Neeson to a subject in the same tone with which he might offer a cup of tea. Things occasionally get a bit cluttered with such a rich life to examine (the flashbacks to Kinseys childhood get short shrift); but Condons screenplay for the most part intelligently suggests rather than tells. In its depiction of a man who attempts to examine sex outside of morals ""Kinsey"" does deliver a bit of moralizing of its own. Sexual freedom in Kinseys marriage and in the notoriously ""open"" marriages of his team results here in little happiness. In one beautifully played scene Kinsey whos been unfaithful tries to explain to Mac that sex is separate from love. His weeping wife isnt buying it. ""Stop using science to justify what youve done"" she sobs. But Condon is also careful to show us characters such as the interview subject played by Lynn Redgrave whose lives have been transformed in a positive way by a more honest sexual climate. Kinsey the man as depicted here was careful to look at all sides of an equation; so is ""Kinsey"" the movie. Ultimately ""Kinsey"" comes down to Prok and Mac a prickly not-always-likable but profoundly believable couple going through their own sexual revolution and living to tell the tale. In the end they walk in the woods still enthralled by the natural world that first drew them together. ""Its impossible to measure love"" the man who helped America understand sex tells his wife. ""When it comes to love were all in the dark.""

Starring Liam Neeson and Laura Linney. Directed by Bill Condon. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Kinsey"" is a feature-length biography of the famed researcher who lifted the veil on human sexual behavior in the 1940s and 50s. Its a film Kinsey himself might have appreciated Its sober never flashy or exciting but always engrossing both for its penetration into Kinseys psychology and for the effects his findings are shown to have on the world and the people around him. The film benefits also from timing. Had ""Kinsey"" been made in 1975 it would have seemed worthy but of purely historical interest. But arriving today in the midst of a culture war and with neo-Puritanism at high tide ""Kinsey"" is suddenly relevant. Theres little doubt Kinsey would be pilloried for his findings today just as he was five decades ago. Thus whether intentional or not ""Kinsey"" is a timely commentary on a certain anti-science anti-sex strain in American life. The name Alfred Kinsey is not unknown to people. But what is not adequately appreciated is that before him there was virtually nothing. Social historians today have a good idea of the progress of sexual mores and behavior as far back as the 1890s thanks mainly to the older people that Kinsey interviewed for his studies. But once we go deeper into history we enter the land of inference -- of teasing meanings from poetry paintings and perhaps the random diary passage. Sex was in the dark for thousands of years of human history. Kinsey turned on the floodlights. Related Stories Sex research saga proves timely The film shows how his background and temperament made him ideally positioned to become a revolutionary. We see him as a child under the thumb of his father a bullying minister (John Lithgow) whos not even into tough love just tough hate. As an adult Kinsey (Liam Neeson) becomes a biologist at Indiana University and specializes in studying gall wasps. Obsessive and thorough he collects a million specimens. Later he would apply the same dispassionate rigor to his study of people. The film is told largely in flashback as Kinsey trains his researchers by having them interview him. Hes a stern boss insisting that his staff learn never to react or express any value judgment in the course of a survey. Kinsey has personal reasons for emphasizing the importance of accurate information. As newlyweds he and his wife (Laura Linney) had difficulty having sex. But because they had the means and the sense to consult a doctor their marriage soon became a jolly frolic. Hes at mid-career when a conversation with a pair of married students makes him aware of the paucity of reliable sex research. Kinsey finds his new passion and enters history by opening his research institute on the Indiana University campus. This is over the objections of some prudish colleagues including one played by Tim Curry who makes an ideal prude He looks as if he might have something to hide. As a character study Kinsey is a rewarding subject a man who cannot escape his past whose life is defined by his rebellion against everything his father stood for. Disillusioned early by his fathers uncharitable version of Christian ethics Kinsey finds it difficult as an adult to recognize any moral value at all. Neesons performance is alive to all these nuances. He also manages to suggest that Kinseys meticulous focus on the mechanistic aspects of sex was a mask for other unconscious impulses driving his life. Accordingly his enemies are not exactly wrong to feel threatened by him. Hes not a dispassionate chronicle but a scientist fashioning his research into a club with which to smash the conventional. Writer-director Bill Condon is honest enough to admit that the consequences of this arent entirely positive. Within Kinseys own institute the researchers -- emboldened in their behavior by their privileged awareness that almost everyone is doing something naughty -- start living according to a more impromptu set of morals. This allows Condon a chance to do something ingenious to present within the institutes confines a petri-dish version of the sexual mores about to be released into the cultural atmosphere lots of mess lots of complication -- with a few prudes off to the side wanting to burn everybody at the stake. No its not a pretty sight but it sure is familiar. ""Kinsey"" gets it right.. -- Advisory Nonstop talk about sex sexual situations full-frontal nudity.

"In Kinsey knowledge is powerful - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW In Kinsey knowledge is powerful By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  November 19 2004 Knowing is better than not knowing.This is the message at the center of Kinsey"" Bill Condons provocative old-fashioned hugely entertaining biopic of sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey. With the fires of controversy over the mans life and work being stoked once more by self-appointed moral guardians its a message that bears repeating Knowing is better than not knowing. The scandal was how much we didnt know about sex before Kinsey came along. The scandal -- and no one needs to be told that this matters in the era of the New Prudery -- is how much we still dont know.Kinseys two scientific bestsellers Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female"" (1953) have been blamed for a lot the sexual revolution Roe v. Wade gay pride the Pill hickeys. The list is endless because whatever sexual issue makes you uncomfortable Kinsey studied it with enthusiastic clinical dispassion. He was an all-American crusader of a type that goes back to Cotton Mather the crucial difference being that he felt the need to save souls in this life through the amassing of observed data rather than the next through faith. And like all zealots he was forged by his mission and warped by it. Its to Condons credit that he shows us the seams buckling.That said this Kinsey is a saint flaws and all. Hes played by Liam Neeson -- Oskar Schindler for Petes sake -- in a performance of heart stubbornness and sympathy. Perhaps too much sympathy; the Kinsey in Condons source biography Jonathan Gathorne-Hardys 1998 Sex the Measure of All Things"" is a pricklier more self-absorbed creature. But where a movie like Ray"" sands off the edges of its subjects life in the interests of bogus dramatic closure Kinsey"" has a larger aim in mind. It wants to remind us what ignorance of ones own biology can cost a person and a society.Condon sketches in the sexually benighted pre-World War II era with amusing and alarming touches the medieval fears about masturbation; the fumbling wedding nights; mentions of the syphilis epidemic sweeping the country. In Neesons Kinsey he has an earnest socially awkward Boy Scout (literally) who rebels against a Bible-thumping father (John Lithgow) by turning to science instead of God becoming an expert on a tiny insect called the gall wasp.Its only with his marriage to a freethinking sparkplug named Clara Mac"" McMillan (Laura Linney) that Kinsey starts to become an expert on humans. The couples hard-won sexual bliss is his moment of truth; he begins to collect peoples sex histories the same way he collected bugs and teaches a marriage course"" at Indiana University that Condon plays for maximum comic impact. A lot of the pleasure in Kinsey"" (the moviegoing kind that is) arises from watching the staid elders and youths of our grandparents generation get hit right between the eyes with the knowledge that theres more than one sexual position -- and that trying a few of them wont kill you. Kinsey himself tried pretty much all of them. It has since become public knowledge that his research unit at Indiana was a hotbed of spouse swapping and sexual experimentation. There was filming there was fiddling around within consensual limits all excused by Kinseys belief that you couldnt interview someone about say the specifics of their homosexuality without having had a homosexual experience yourself. From a research viewpoint he was dead right but the best parts of Kinsey"" -- and they still dont go quite far enough -- probe the unmeasurable gulf between observation and desire. Kinsey becomes a god to his cadre of young interviewers (Peter Sarsgaard Chris ODonnell and Timothy Hutton) even as hes sleeping with some of them but its they not he who fully understand the risks.Mac gets in on some of the fun too and youre glad for the characters sake because Linney plays her so well with a mischievous intelligent kinky streak and a mournful awareness of where science will and wont go. In general Kinsey"" accurately depicts the bomb craters the Kinsey Reports left in the American psyche and it arrays the forces of openness and uptightness with care from sympathizers like IU president Herman Wells (Oliver Platt) and Alan Gregg (Dylan Baker) of the Rockefeller Foundation to horrorstruck opponents like colleague Thurman Rice (Tim Curry) even down to Kinseys divided children (his daughters were pro his son con).Where Condon runs into a snag is the scene in which Kinsey and one of his men interview Kenneth Braun (William Sadler) an omnisexual amateur researcher"" who collected data on his own experiences which extended to animals family members and children. The character is based on Kenneth Green who provided Kinsey with many statistics on child sexuality and its meant as a rejoinder to charges by various fringe opponents that Kinsey was himself a pedophile. And thats the problem The scene feels forced brought in to buttress an argument. It only raises more questions. (For answers turn to Gathorne-Hardys book one of the most scrupulously balanced biographies Ive ever read.)Condon loves his old movies -- his last Gods and Monsters"" was a meditation on the director of Frankenstein"" -- and Kinsey"" is a foursquare Great Man film in the grand tradition The Story of Louis Pasteur"" with French ticklers instead of microscopes. It also fills the Beautiful Mind"" slot in the end-of-the-year awards sweepstakes but it cuts fewer biographical corners than that film and it returns again and again to the pain and devastation caused by sexual repression. (Theres a scene toward the end involving a surprise cameo by a well-known actress that brings it home in high three-hankie style.)Is Kinsey"" too hampered by biopic conventions? Its hard to argue otherwise as the film winds down and as Neesons diffident scientist is more and more beset by forces he has set in motion in society and within himself. As superbly crafted -- as good -- as this movie is Condon never really owns up to the cloud of pessimism at its center. Hes more interested in the march of social progress. If only it were that easy.Alfred Kinsey unhooked sex from morality and guilt because someone had to if we were ever to understand why we do the things we do. He suffered in the bargain -- not for our sins but for the still-revolutionary idea that as Kinsey tells a reporter everybodys sin is nobodys sin."" Aside from the look of growing distress on Neesons face we never grasp the details of that suffering and its a shame. Youd think that Condon would understand by now that knowing is better than not knowing.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review Liam Neeson Laura Linney Alfred C. Kinsey or Create your own Manage alerts | What is this? LOS ANGELES California (CNN) -- ""Kinsey"" is a brutally honest uncompromising and nonjudgmental look at a man who irrevocably changed American culture sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey who published ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" and ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Female"" in the late 40s and early 50s.After his years of elaborate interviews which he called ""sex histories"" Kinseys books revealed that what society thought people did behind the bedroom door and what they actually did were vastly different.Kinseys conclusion -- that each persons sexual make-up is unique and therefore the word ""normal"" isnt relevant when dealing with human sexuality (there is only ""common"" or ""rare"" behavior) -- had people frothing at the mouth in the 1940s and continues to drive many into vein-popping outrage in 2004. (Witness the protests against this film.)""Kinsey"" is the second time that writer/director Bill Condon has tackled a biographical film about a controversial man whose work and sex life were intertwined. In ""Gods and Monsters"" (starring Ian McKellan) he created a sensitive portrait of gay filmmaker James Whale. Now hes taken on the much much larger subject of Kinsey who lived a life of controversy on a gigantic scale.Condon frames this complex story beautifully. Using scenes in which Kinseys researchers are taking their boss through his own sexual history allows the director to flash back to Kinseys early youth. This is where we meet his strict and repressive father played in a well-calibrated performance by John Lithgow.Condon then intertwines Kinseys early scientific work meeting his wife and his awakening interest in sexual research through these interviews.Brilliant -- and unsettlingIts a brilliant structure and allows the audience to be drawn into this story -- which quite frankly can be extremely unsettling at times. Kinseys unrelenting quest to explore sexual boundaries and the way he and his researchers got physically involved in the process can become amazingly uncomfortable for viewers. Even the most jaded moviegoer (and I count myself in that number) may squirm in their seat. Kinseys student and colleague Clyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard left) has relationships with both Kinsey and Kinseys wife Clara (Laura Linney).Liam Neeson is nothing short of magnificent in the title role. This is the second time hes played a very complicated and very driven real-life man. The first of course was in the film ""Schindlers List"" for which he earned an Academy Award nomination. It is very likely that Oscar will once again come calling to honor this deeply layered and totally compelling performance.The same can be said for Laura Linney who plays Clara McMillen the woman -- nicknamed ""Mac"" -- who became Kinseys wife and lifelong research partner. Linney displays her astounding range in this role which allows her to explore emotions ranging from delightful playfulness and humor to gut-wrenching anger and sorrow.Both Timothy Hutton and Chris ODonnell playing supporting roles as Kinseys sex researchers Paul Gebhard and Wardell Pomeroy give strong well-grounded performances.Not judgmentalBut its Peter Sarsgaard playing the bisexual researcher Clyde Martin whose performance stands out and confirms that hes without doubt one of the best character actors of his generation.Martin had sexual affairs with both Kinsey and his wife and Sarsgaard plays those potentially difficult sex scenes -- one of which required full-frontal nudity -- with complete authority and a breathtaking honesty.Ultimately Condon allows the audience to make their own judgments about this complicated man. The writer and directors ""warts and all"" approach to the life of the obsessive Kinsey whose drive and single-mindedness could be maddening is refreshing and highly satisfying dramatically.This seems to be the year of the biographical film. Ray Charles life was examined in the film ""Ray"" and the life of playwright James M. Barrie -- the man who created Peter Pan -- gets the treatment in ""Finding Neverland."" In the upcoming movie ""The Aviator"" the Hollywood years of the legendary Howard Hughes go under the microscope Bobby Darin is profiled in ""Beyond the Sea"" and even Alexander the Great is getting the once over in ""Alexander.""But none of them is as relevant today as the life story of Kinsey the man whose study of human sexuality remains a part of societys still raging debate over what is moral or immoral in regards to s-e-x. ""Kinsey"" does its subjects -- human biological and psychological -- justice.Story Tools Subscribe to Time for 1.99 Review Perfect Man fatally flawed CNN/Money What TVs most popular dads earn Poll Most prefer to watch movies at home Cruise Holmes engaged to marryCNN/Money Security alert issued for 40 million credit cards Bin Laden deputy sends message U.S. House votes to keep U.N. dues Iran poll to go to run-off ALL AL AK AZ AR CA CO CT DE DC FL GA HI ID IL IN IA KS KY LA ME MD MA MI MN MS MO MT NE NV NH NJ NM NY NC ND OH OK OR PA RI SC SD TN TX UT VT VA WA WV WI WY International Edition Languages --------- Arabic German Japanese Korean Turkish CNN TV CNN International Headline News Transcripts Advertise With Us About Us SEARCH The Web CNN.com (c) 2005 Cable News Network LP LLLP.

"Kinsey hits all the right spots. Slate Sign In Sign Up Kinsey hits all the right spots. Kinsey hits all the right spots. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 11 2004 612 PM Pansexual Healing This biopic of the famous sex researcher Alfred Kinsey gets it right. By David Edelstein Neeson disguised as Kinsey The biographical movie is the least-satisfying of film genres and not because biopics lack intelligence or ambition They are often thoughtful and almost always a showcase for virtuoso acting. The problem is that they tend to lack a dramatic spine being organized around such small matters as birth childhood marriage (or the want of it) the accomplishment that justifies the biopic in the first place and death. Chronology is a reliable deadener of drama and starting in the present and pointedly flashing back to Freudian hot spots fools no one Its the same spread-out superficial literal-minded linearity pretzeled up to impress the Academy. You get some weird constructions like Ray a movie shaped along formulaic Oscar-bait lines to celebrate a triumph over tragic adversity in which the hero--thanks to honest writing and acting--is a solipsistic shithead. Form and content are rival blood types fatally incompatible. And then there are the glorious exceptions like Kinsey (Fox Searchlight). Im telling you this one almost justifies the whole genre. The life the accomplishments and the drama somehow coalesce--at least they do in the hands of the writer-director Bill Condon. The movie boils down for me to a single endlessly reverberating phrase ""Morality disguised as fact."" Thats what Alfred Kinsey (Liam Neeson) calls sex education in the late 1930s as he prepares to teach a revolutionary course at Indiana University in ""Marriage."" The phrase is incendiary even today (especially today) and it shapes and drives the film ""Morality disguised as fact"" warps the young Kinsey as it warped his puritanical father (John Lithgow); it galvanizes the work of the scientist and pioneer sex researcher; and it ultimately consumes the man. Advertisement Condons structure is incisive Kinsey opens with the mature Kinsey drilling three of his research assistants (Peter Sarsgaard Chris ODonnell and Timothy Hutton) on how to pose questions for a survey of sexual habits--the survey that would ultimately involve thousands of subjects and form the core of the revolutionary 1948 study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and its female-oriented 1953 sequel. The point says Kinsey is to make the subject feel comfortable--because after all people could be shamed when they talk as no one has talked before about how they masturbate how they fantasize how they have sex. Practicing his interviewing techniques on Kinsey Sarsgaards Clyde Martin asks about the professors father--the cue for a look of panic (actually the first close-up of Neeson in the movie) and a flashback that serves as the first half of the film. Here is the adolescent Kinsey being bullied and shamed by his moralistic dad and then being drilled about the danger to ones brain if one touches oneself sexually. And then comes a nice flourish Condon slaps his writer-director credit over a shot of young Kinsey in his sleeping bag endangering his brain something fierce. It should be said that Kinsey is not a masturbatory movie. Its broadly sympathetic while maintaining a clinicians conscientious detachment. From the beginning as a researcher specializing in an insect known as the gall wasp Kinsey fastens on the idea that individuals within species could show an infinite number of variations In other words there are no abnormal gall wasps only millions of diverse little critters to be individually (and obsessively) cataloged. You get a good idea what Clara McMillen (Laura Linney) is up against when she flirts with her reclusive professor on the lawn at lunchtime She has to justify her intrusion by pointing out that hes the only unattached male and shes the only unattached female in the vicinity. That courtship scene in which he ponders the significance of his students nickname for him--""Prok"" for ""Professor Kinsey"" and she suggests it maybe comes from the fact that they ""like him""--makes you laugh while demonstrating how cut off the man is from the rest of the human race. Neeson is very deft and very delicate at using his stature to convey that estrangement Hes like Karloffs Frankensteins monster with a Ph.D. This stunted giant then announces that humans are bigger more complicated gall wasps. And in the films buoyant central section science gallops past the barricades erected (and fiercely reinforced) by morality We see heads popping up on a map of the United States each spilling the beans about his or her hush-hush practices behind closed doors. Never has the simple amassing of raw data seemed so subversively elating. Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy whose wonderful chatty biography was a source for Condons screenplay writes ""Kinsey felt he could only study [sex] by stripping away all but its physiological functions first removing moral judgments second even harder emotions and feelings. For both he was ideally equipped psychologically and for both he was savagely criticized."" Whats inspiring about Kinsey is that it never streamlines this complexity Its protagonist is a martyr to American moralism unfairly denounced (and abandoned by his patron the Rockefeller Foundation) for ""insecticizing American womanhood"" and a selfish man whose steely exploration of his own bisexuality in the name of science takes a toll on his wife and colleagues. But if its hard to feel much for Kinsey when he watches impassive as a fight breaks out over the wife-swapping within his research team its impossible not to share his joy as he wanders near the end among California redwoods with his loyal wife ever-enthralled by the vastness of the natural world. Kinsey is a stupendously moving film. Neeson nails Kinseys rock-hard decency and fragile ego and Linney abets him beautifully There isnt an actress in movies right now whos more simply alive. Is her character the voice of conventionality? Sometimes but its a sensible and vivacious conventionality--a conventionality that recognizes the evolutionary value of family and social responsibility. On the other side Lithgow brings the anger of Kinseys father all the way into himself lashing out with such credible sadism that the characters final shocker--while being interviewed by Kinsey for his study an invented scene that works like gangbusters--seems like something we should have guessed from the beginning This guy had some seriously bad parenting himself. The movie ends with real Kinsey footage of animals (including porcupines) humping but thats not the most subversive part. Its casting Tim Curry Dr. Frank-N-Furter himself as the voice of academic repression--the rival professor who disguises morality as fact. It brings us full circle doesnt it? Isnt Kinsey in a way the father of the man-on-woman woman-on-monster monster-on-man pansexual utopia of The Rocky Horror Picture Show? I can see him now adding his voice to the sum of all voices singing ""Lets do the time-warp agaaaaaaaiiiin....""

More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Even as AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases force us to spend more time talking about sex or watching it than actually doing it we remain obsessed often in unsavory ways -- and Im not just talking about smut. On the evidence of last weeks election more people are taking an inordinate interest in what gay men and women do in the privacy of their own bedrooms. And only the other day I heard a concerned mother no doubt one of the many such who voted Bush into his second term wax plaintive on NPR about the irresponsibility of sex education in high schools where advice on contraception is afforded equal time with abstinence counseling. What Alfred Kinsey a pioneer of whatever liberty the American libido managed to snatch for itself in the 20th century would think of our carnally benighted new age is not hard to guess. Scientist activist and (once he got the hang of it) swinger extraordinaire Kinsey was a passionate believer in the liberating power of knowledge. I have no doubt hed have judged that concerned mother to be both a spoilsport and a public-health risk accountable in part for the epidemic of STDs and unwanted pregnancies. Had he lived Kinsey would certainly have cheered on the sexual revolution of the 60s an era he arguably helped spawn. But to judge by Bill Condons smart humane new movie about the exhilarating tangle that was Kinseys life and work he was no hippie -- though I suspect that for professional and other reasons he wouldnt be averse to time spent on Internet porn sites given half a chance. Condon who made the superb Gods and Monsters a life of the barely closeted Bride of Frankenstein director James Whale has said he wanted to avoid making a staid biopic of Kinsey and its true that Kinsey is jazzed by stylistic bells and whistles that make the movie great fun to watch. Its framed by reconstructions by turns wickedly funny and ineffably sad of the up-close interviews Kinsey and his gung-ho researchers conducted with solid citizens whores gay barflies and sex maniacs all over America culminating in an entertaining map of the country dotted with voluble talking heads their tongues loosened by Kinseys candid questioning. Mostly though the camera is poignantly turned on Kinsey himself to probe what transformed him from a repressed nerd into the sexual radical he became.

Condon guides us methodically through Kinseys oppressive childhood with a rigidly puritanical father (judiciously underplayed by John Lithgow); the famous ""marriage course"" at Indiana University to which hundreds of students flocked ravenous for sexual information and confirmation of what they were already doing under wraps; his marriage to Clara McMillen the free-thinking chemistry student who became his partner in all his experiments on and off the curriculum; the establishment of the Institute for Sexual Research where Kinsey collected varieties of human sexual behavior with the same impassioned zeal hed brought as a young zoologist to the study of the gall wasp; his leap to fame with the publication of his vast report on male sexuality; and his recruitment of his research team for after-hours activities that brought out the polysexual in all of them and in some cases ruined their lives. Kinsey is a work of passionate advocacy by an openly homosexual filmmaker but Condon doesnt make the mistake of appropriating Kinsey as a gay icon even though the former prude embraced his homosexual side with gusto once he discovered it and controversially credited a third of Americas male population with homosexual proclivities. Nor is this a hagiography. On the contrary the movies strength lies in its portrayal of a many-sided genius as manipulative as he was charming and persuasive monomaniacal to a fault generous and sweet yet utterly clueless about the emotional havoc he wrought in the name of science and like all crusaders for society with more than a touch of the fanatic about him. According to Condon Kinseys tragedy was that he was his fathers son. His triumph was that he managed to get over it. Most movingly though Kinsey is also a fleshed-out portrait of a highly unusual marriage. The movie is also often very funny as any film would be that featured Tim Curry as a crusader for abstinence and its hard to imagine a less likely-looking pair of sexual adventurers than Kinsey (Liam Neeson) and Clara (Laura Linney). Like Nick Nolte another big lug whod have been just as good in the role Neeson can be bearish cuddly wounded and unwittingly dangerous all at once. Awkward in tweeds bow tie and porcupine hair Neesons Kinsey or Prok as he was affectionately (and otherwise) known to students and colleagues is an ungainly professorial type with no gift for small talk. Condons sporadically stiff screenplay feels appropriate to a man who for all his charisma was so ill-attuned to the social signals of others that he could speechify for hours without noticing their eyes glaze over.  We see Kinsey in early manhood sexually untutored and so hopelessly confused about what to put where in bed that his wedding night is an unmitigated disaster and not only for anatomical reasons. One visit to a doctor and a frank talk between the sheets later the pair are enjoying a rip-roaring sex life and not only with one another. In a way the film belongs less to Kinsey than it does to Clara sensitively rendered by Linney as a woman of such breadth of vision that she can see where her husband cant both the joy of free sex and its terrible costs. For all her luminous beauty Linney is at once the most adventurous and least vain of actresses. I doubt shell be gaining 50 pounds or strapping on a false nose for the sake of an Oscar any time soon but as Clara (Mac to the couples intimates) she does stupendous things with a bit of wrinkle makeup and her own elastic emotional range. Thin brown and freckled mousy Mac is also as it turns out game for almost anything including bedding at least one of her husbands young research associates who are ably played by Peter Scarsgaard Chris ODonnell and a deliciously sleazy Timothy Hutton. Yet its also a deeply hurt Mac who spells out for her clueless husband the emotional toll exacted by his relentless pursuit of the sexual diversity he regards as normal. ""Did you ever stop to think"" she cries to her uncomprehending spouse ""that those social restraints were meant to stop people from hurting each other?"" The dilemmas she poses will be entirely familiar to any 60s graduate who had to listen to a euphoric partner tell them they slept with someone else or several someone elses for the good of their relationship and the cause of free love. Condon doesnt take a position on this. Hes showing us that everything has its price and that it is often precisely those visionary enough to push a whole society forward who also have a tin ear for the suffering they cause to those closest to them. As I write George Bush is crowing over a victory he is said to have won on a platform of moral values. Were he alive today Kinsey would gnash his teeth over the armies of concerned mothers who voted Bush back in (the sad downside of getting out a female vote that went missing by a stunning 22 million in 2000) not to mention the 11 states that elected to ban gay marriage -- surely more an attack on gay lifestyles than a defense of heterosexual marriage. This outcome is a sad reflection on a crucial line in the movie that must surely be a direct quote Kinseys impassioned plea that ""Sexual morality needs to be reformed and science will show the way."" Yet the fact that gay marriage is up for debate at all is to some degree a function of his legacy. At the end of Kinsey a straight-looking middle-aged woman (played by Lynn Redgrave who also gave a hilariously mournful reading of James Whales faithful housekeeper in Gods and Monsters) gives radiant thanks to Kinsey for helping her take a leap that transformed her life. Kinsey died at 62 arguably of a broken heart after the Rockefeller Foundation withdrew his funding and Americas morality police drew the line at his findings that women masturbated had real orgasms and even cheated %0 40 on their husbands. But he never stopped working and his heritage lives on in the intensity of our public quarrels about sex and in the range of ""unnatural practices"" he fought to establish as lying within the definition of what is normal.   IF ALFRED KINSEY DISCOVERED sex and ran with it J.M. Barrie who wrote Peter Pan and is the subject of the new movie Finding Neverland may never have gotten it off the ground. By many accounts the Edwardian Scot famous for writing the play that captured the imaginations of kids the world over and established kiddie lit as a lucrative market had a habit of attaching himself to other families most notably the Llewellyn Davieses a family with five boys whom he met and befriended in Londons Kensington Gardens. Marc Forsters surprisingly wan film (coming from the director of Monsters Ball) adapted by David Magee from a play by Allan Knee strongly suggests that Barrie (Johnny Depp) drew not just on his relationship with the boys for Peter Pan but also that the play was written in the throes of romantic love for their mother Sylvia (Kate Winslet).   Im all for free adaptation and Im willing to believe that just about anyone who has laid eyes on Kate Winslet would fall in love on the spot. But this interpretation seems to be a strategic if distorting avoidance of Barries intense relationship with children -- you dont have to believe as some do that he was a pedophile to say children awoke whatever passed in him for libido -- and the fact that he was always a big kid himself. The movie spans a period of several years in which Barrie trapped in a loveless and probably sexless marriage to a tight-assed social climber (Radha Mitchell) takes up with the Llewellyn Davieses and gestates the play that will make his career. Much buzz is being generated about Depps performance being Oscar-worthy about which I can only say that he does a highly credible Scottish accent. Unfortunately its the wrong one a broad brogue more worthy of a Glasgow shipyard worker than of the effete patrician Barrie. Depp is warmer than Ive ever seen him but his performance is strangely muted and grave for a man who liked nothing better than to frolic with a bunch of kids. Winslet is radiant and earthy as ever even as she sickens unto death. Julie Christie is wonderfully acidic as Sylvias controlling mother and Dustin Hoffman is good for a few laughs as Barries long-suffering producer. But theyre all upstaged by one little boy (Freddie Highmore) who plays the Llewellyn Davieses youngest son and who lets Barrie know in no uncertain terms that not he but Barrie himself is the true inspiration for the boy who never grew up. Its the one moment of truth in a flat timid picture that only gathers steam in its last half-hour and though I dont believe in giving Oscars to little kids -- even the best are usually following very close direction -- Id waive the rule for young Highmore. The final scene in which the sorrowing child his thin little face pinched with grief sits with Barrie on a park bench and buries his face in the playwrights coat transcends its schmaltzy intent and becomes the high point in what is otherwise as Peter Pan might have put it an awfully small adventure.

The man some social arbiters credit (or blame) for igniting the sexual revolution gets lively sometimes funny and inevitably provocative biopic treatment in ""Kinsey."" More upfront about sex both verbally and visually than anything usually expected from an R-rated studio-affiliated star-laden feature Bill Condons first directorial outing since ""Gods and Monsters"" provides a bracing sense of the pervasive ignorance and avoidance of sexual information that made Alfred Kinseys pioneering research such a bombshell in post-war America. Pics subject matter and very breezy approach to it will make this a hot want-see with sophisticated audiences and the more controversy it generates in the popular media the better B.O. will be for this Fox Searchlight release upon its Nov. 12 opening. A Harvard-trained zoologist with an esoteric specialty in gall wasps Kinsey was a middle-aged biology professor at the Indiana U when questions from his students made him realize how little was actually known and documented about sex and sexual practices. He started changing that with a frank ""marriage"" course at school and ultimately embarked upon an enormous research project that involved interviewing thousands of people nationwide about their detailed sexual histories. When the first fruits of his labors were published in 1948 as ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Male"" the book became a huge bestseller as well as a cultural flashpoint. With information that nonjudgmentally revealed far more pre-marital extramarital and homosexual activity in the populace than anyone would have suspected the book both astonished and outraged with some even smelling a Communist plot to break down the fabric of American culture. When his study of females appeared five years later statistics -- such as those indicating that nearly 50 per cent of women had premarital sex -- insured even greater wrath. ""Kinsey"" is good at portraying the socially upright backdrop for the doctors unpremeditated subversion while also making clear that the nation was nowhere near as square as simplistic portraits might suggest. In deft strokes the picture illustrates how Kinseys personality was importantly forged in reaction to his impossibly demanding Methodist Sunday School teacher father (John Lithgow) and how his obsessive interest in tiny insects made him an unlikely candidate to become a sexual pioneer or even a husband. That changes when at Indiana Kinsey (Liam Neesom) meets Clara McMillen (Laura Linney) an equally brainy student whos aggressive and attractive enough to get him to look up from the microscope. Film loosens the audience up and prepares it for much to come with the couples mutual confession of virginity on their wedding night (Kinsey was 26) and with the frank and funny treatment of their sexual incompatibility resulting from Kinsey being too big for his bride a problem that could only be solved surgically. After that theyre as busy as bunnies. Kinseys scientific interest in human sexuality begins when students begin coming to him with questions he cant answer and for which he realizes there is no documentation. Books written for young marrieds are fairy tales loaded with info and advice thats misleading at best and terribly damaging at worst. This leads him in 1938 to teach the marriage class which instead of pussyfooting around what happens in the sack gets down to the nitty-gritty with a bluntness that initially shocks and embarrasses students unaccustomed to seeing projected photos of male and female genitalia but also creates SRO crowds. Kinseys adventurous methods attract campus critics as well as acolytes and among the latter is a small group of earnest enthusiastic young men to whom he begins teaching proper interrogation techniques to collect sexual data. These interviews scattered throughout the film are cheerfully straightforward and uncensored an attitude made manifest in a nifty little montage sequence in which a few talking heads multiply into dozens and more across a map of the United States covered with faces happily nattering on about their sex lives. Tale of a door being opened to a long-locked room takes an unexpected turn when Kinsey ventures to Chicago with his closest young associate Clyde Martin (Peter Sarsgaard) to interview men in a gay bar. Sessions go so well that once in their hotel room a nude Clyde propositions his boss and mentor which in turn leads to funny/sad confessions to Clara and a subsequent table-turning on Kinsey as well as much speculation on what per cent gay or straight bisexuals can be. Account extends to the ""swinging"" that Kinsey encourages in his proteges who also include Wardell Pomeroy (Chris ODonnell) and Paul Gebhard (Timothy Hutton) and their wives/girlfriends but the sweep of Condons screenplay simply doesnt leave enough time to deal with this satisfactorily; one gets the unsurprising impression that the men were far more enthusiastic about the idea than were the women but no more. With success as revolutionary as Kinseys comes notoriety and with notoriety comes unwanted attention from the likes of the FBI and political high-grounders. Criticism of ""Sexual Behavior in the Human Female"" results in the withdrawal of funding from the Rockefeller Foundation and the more Kinsey is forced into the role of crusader due to his victimization the less interesting and distinctive he becomes as a dramatic figure. Apparently exhausted and overstressed the normally tireless Kinsey died of a heart attack in 1956 at 62. For most of the way though ""Kinsey"" is an interesting life story told in a fun disarming way. Charging through a superficially reticent world like an intelligent bull Neeson makes Kinsey into a force of nature a properly raised late-blooming hedonist for whom no sexual act is unnatural and whose first commandment to his interviewers is ""Never make judgments about people."" Adorned like the real man with an unruly thatch of wheat-like hair Neeson gives his character a vigorous reading whose humorousness often stems from his self-involved obliviousness. Linney marvelously conveys the diverse qualities that make Clara a woman able to cope with such a man one whose behavior demands even greater flexibility and understanding as the years go on. Linneys Clara is crucially a salt of the earth character specifically the Indiana earth of 100 years ago that could take bitter cold and brutal heat and still be highly fertile. Supporting turns are convincing and uniformly energized. Striking cameos are provided by William Sadler as an aging sexual gourmand and deviant proud to illuminate a lifetime of sexual adventuring for Kinseys delectation and Lynn Redgrave as a woman whose desire to thank Kinsey for helping her navigate a mid-life change in sexual orientation gives the film a warmly human albeit perhaps too self-consciously calculated a capper. Frederick Elmes boldly colorful widescreen lensing combines with Richard Shermans production design and Bruce Finlaysons costumes to provide a half-centurys worth of period feel while Carter Burwells strong score contains evocative strains of musical Americana.
