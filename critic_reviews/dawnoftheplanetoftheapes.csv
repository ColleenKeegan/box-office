With it comes a worthy successor. No other-worldly Hollywood actioner of recent vintage come close to playing by the rules of the robust fantasy universe it puts forth like this pair of premium summer blockbusters. Its been over a decade since ape last set sight on man a situation that could have remained unchanged were it not for humankinds natural inclination to engage in resource wars this time against a society devoid of fuel. It has 25 long minutes on its predecessor and gosh only knows the motion-capture simians frequently out-emote their live-action counterparts. That said my disbelief remained wilfully suspended throughout. Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) mercifully kicks his jiggle-cam to the curb and in its place gives us assured rock steady direction - a long shot taken from inside a rotating tank turret as it surveys the wreckage made my goose pimples burble.

We have already had Rupert Wyatts ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011); now it is Matt Reevess turn to steer us through the dawn. (Will we be invited to stay for Lunchtime of the Planet of the Apes? How about Cocktail Hour?) Already there are signs of strain in the saga; where Wyatt found something funny and touching in the pacts as well as the contretemps between humans and primates the new film plows ahead with added solemnity and far more firepower but a fraction of the quizzical wit. The scene is one of nervous apocalypse; most of humanity having been erased survivors eke out a life in the ruins of San Francisco. Jason Clarke and Keri Russell play a liberal couple who befriend the apes and enlist their help in opening a blocked dam. (Is this the first blockbuster to be predicated on plumbing?) The plan is supported by Caesar the simian chief--played as before by Andy Serkis with expressive grace and a dose of high-grade C.G.I.--and opposed by his rival a fearsome bonobo. For dramatic verve and emotional nuance apes trounce people hands down and the movie suffers badly from the mismatch; all traces of finesse are trampled by the bombast of the climax.      --Anthony Lane Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Fantastic movie Filled with great storytelling wonderful special effects and a captivating emotional core. It would seem difficult to convince people that this is the best planet of the apes movie since the original 1968 film. But the truth is Dawn of the Apes is close to perfection. And Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar nomination. DCWhatthesaid on Friday July 18 2014 90857 AMSaw this a second time after walking out of Sex Tape. Damn I loved this. The fact that one side of the battle were an army of apes made no difference to the realism of the story or the intended message. Honeybrown1976said on Monday July 14 2014 103649 PMWill the Academy please give Serkis an Oscar now? Hes earned it more than ever. C Lindermansaid on Monday July 14 2014 60955 PMI dont think this film was good enough for a 90+ critic score. A very dark film with no humor and the plot line seemed contrived. Overall Id give it a 50 percent. Billysaid on Saturday July 12 2014 32424 AMGreat review Richard. Its weird time we live in became we want to praise the actor but the reality is what we see is a hodge lodge of his choices the CG artists flourishes and the directors ideas.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Jul 11 2014 Culture For the second time in three weeks Hollywood has offered us a summer blockbuster in which the CGI characters are more compelling than the human ones. Last time it was Michael Bays Transformers Age of Extinction which accomplished the feat by presenting us with human beings duller and less expressive than a box of Hasbro toys. Matt Reevess Dawn of the Planet of the Apes by contrast marks a far more singular achievement rendering its titular apes with such nuance and sophistication that it is easy to forget they are constructed out of pixels.The evidence that we are entering an age of post-human filmmaking has been gathering for some time last years Pacific Rim say or this springs Godzilla. Replace a Charlie Hunnam here or an Aaron Taylor-Johnson there with any comparably Cybexed alternative and who would notice? Even a star as effortlessly magnetic as Angelina Jolie was to some degree swallowed up by the effects deployed around her in Maleficent.Related Story The Science of Planet of the Apes Could Simians Get Scary Smart? It is true that--as was the case with this movies precursor Rise of the Planet of the Apes--the human cast of the sequel is not particularly indelible. Aussie Jason Clarke is at least at this juncture in his career a better actor than he is a movie star. (He should have been nominated for an Oscar for his role as ""Dan"" in Zero Dark Thirty.) Keri Russell is perfectly adequate too (though not one-fifth as memorable as she is on The Americans) as are Kodi Smit-McPhee and a mostly-here-for-the-paycheck Gary Oldman.But any shortcomings on the part of the movies homo sapiens are more than made up for by their simian costars. Going back to his Gollum days Andy Serkis has been a pioneer--really the pioneer--in the hybrid form thats now known as ""performance capture."" So its fitting that he returns to lend his voice- face- and body-work to Caesar the hyper-intelligent chimpanzee he played in the prior film. (Its fitting too that for once he gets top billing in the credits.) Precisely how one should divvy up credit for the performance between Serkis and his special-effects team at Weta Digital is hard to discern. (Likewise for Serkiss fellow ape actors.) But ultimately its beside the point The performers and digital artists are so utterly intimately in sync that theres more than enough credit to go around.When last we saw Caesar he was leading his rag-tag ape army over the Golden Gate Bridge and into Muir Woods while the viral drug that had given him his intellect was having the unfortunate side effect of spreading lethally throughout the human population. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes picks up directly from that point with a de rigeur bit of newscast exposition charting the progress of the plague 5 million casualties 150 million... There are meltdowns both nuclear and social and over the course of a decade (though only a few minutes of screen time) the human race is all but wiped out in the most perfunctory manner conceivable.Little matter Following this tedious calamity were introduced to the arboreal city-state Caesar and his friends have built among the redwoods. The set design is impeccable--their cliff-clinging home is built on the remains of an old 76 gas station off route 101--and the apes themselves are nothing short of a revelation. (Particularly magnificent is Caesars old orangutan buddy Maurice again played by Karin Konoval Somewhere Dr. Zaius is eating his heart out.) We witness the apes conversing with a combination of sign language grunts and occasional English words. Were treated to a hunt with primitive spears to the birth of a chimplet and to a near-death by bear mauling. Mostly we just watch in awe as the apes lope majestically among the trees of Marin County. Its actually a bit of a letdown when the human beings eventually show up.Its actually a bit of a letdown when the human beings eventually show up.But show up they do. A community of survivors has settled in the ruins of San Francisco and they send a small party led by Malcolm (Clarke) and Ellie (Russell) to restart a hydroelectric dam in the apes territory in hopes of supplying power for the city. The plot that unfolds from this point will be familiar to anyone whos seen Dances with Wolves or Kingdom of Heaven or Avatar or any of a few dozen other movies about the need for peace and understanding between races/religions/species. There are decent tolerant souls among human and ape alike and there are also suspicious warmongering bigots. (The latter camp supplies a role for Oldman on one side and features Koba the escaped laboratory bonobo from the last film on the other.) Id like to say there are many unexpected twists along the way but the script hews rather scrupulously to formula.That said Reevess direction is crisp (hes best known for 2008s Cloverfield) the action sequences superb (keep an eye out for the scene in which Koba commandeers a tank) the Michael Giacchino score intense and evocative and the apes--well theyre easily worth the price of admission on their own. Reeves has signed on to direct and co-write a third installment of the franchise and there are intimations at the films conclusion that it may again feature an all-new cast of human foils for Caesar and the gang. I cant help but think that it might be wiser still to forgo our species altogether and make the next movie all-ape. It is after all the logical next step in this particular cinematic evolution.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

Just not necessarily in the way we might imagine. Sure there will be combat sequences pitting survivors of a pandemic that all but wiped out the human race against apes who when we last saw them were high-tailing it out of the San Francisco by way of the Golden Gate Bridge headed toward the Muir Woods. But the real showdown comes when Gary Oldman puts the finest of motion-capture performers on notice. Its a figurative face-off -- Oldmans character and star Andy Serkis Ceasar are not in the same scene -- but one that speaks to the problems with this sequel. For all its high-end special effects and its Shakespearean ambitions ""Dawn"" fumbles its emotional moments and forces its action. When the film opens the chimpanzees under the leadership of the genetically tweaked and wise Caesar have made a fine and cooperative life in the thick forest. Caesar has a family wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) teen son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and a baby on the way. Old adversary Koba (Toby Kebbell) has become an ally. Aging Orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval) counsels the adults and mentors the young. This peace is upended with the first human encounter in a decade. The decimating virus bore the name Simian Flu so some humans are particularly cagey about apes. They are also forgetful that the microbial catastrophe was ginned up in a genetic-testing lab in hopes of curing Alzheimers disease. Jason Clarke portrays Malcolm an architect who along with teenage son Alexander and Ellie (Keri Russell) a former Centers for Disease Control nurse venture into the woods to locate a dam. The trio and others from a survivors colony hope to get the off-line dam back in working order. The meeting goes badly but concludes with an act of mercy. There will be more and more encounters ending with less and less compassion. This encounter also brings guns back into the apes lives. And how. If you wonder how many live rounds there could possibly be left after years of human warfare and no munitions production writers Mark Bomback Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver provide an answer. Like so much of the movie directed by Matt Reeves its not fully satisfying. Although Caesar and Malcolm are fathers of teen sons and his communitys cooler heads the ape leaders truer big-screen counterpart is Dreyfus leader of the human colony. Gary Oldman is good at doing a lot with brief screen time. In one quiet fleeting moment he offers a grief that earns its pang. This scene is mirrored later when Caesar returns to the house where he was cared for as a youngster by friend and researcher Will (James Franco). Its a nice touch. More often the writers work too hard trying to convince us of the apes well humanity. They already pulled that off in ""Rise."" People at a preview screening snickered when Cornelia gave birth. Weve seen this scene thousands of times. That adding fascinatingly rendered apes doesnt provide a ""wow"" moment shows just how quickly we grow accustomed to the achievements of effects wizards.

"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes starring Andy Serkis and Judy Greer reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Dawn of the Planet of the Apes The Smartest Most Entertaining Studio Release of the Summer Dawn of the Planet of the Apes The Smartest Most Entertaining Studio Release of the Summer Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 11 2014 1232 PM Dawn of the Planet of the Apes The primate revolution enters its Reign of Terror phase. By Dana Stevens Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a grimmer more violent affair than its predecessor. Still courtesy of 20th Century Fox Click on the player below to listen to Slates Dana Stevens and David Weigel discuss Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Note This podcast is meant to be heard after youve seen the film.   Rupert Wyatts Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) was one of my favorite summer blockbusters in recent memory largely because it featured what felt like a groundbreaking motion-capture performance from Andy Serkis as Caesar a genetically engineered hyperintelligent ape. After hes abandoned to a life in captivity by the geneticist (James Franco) who raised him like a human son Caesar eventually spearheads a primate rebellion. Whatever alchemy of high-end animation technology and actorly skill it was that brought this philosopher-ape to life Caesar made for a gripping and unusually complex antihero a Frankenstein monster betrayed by his creator who only reluctantly after mourning his ejection from the human world steps up to his role as the simian Moses. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. In the thrilling ape uprising at the end of Rise of the Planet of the Apes an impromptu militia of chimps gorillas and orangutans shut down the Golden Gate Bridge. (The fact that human audiences--members after all of the species being routed on-screen--couldnt help cheering for the apes to prevail says something about how seriously Rise treated questions about the distinction between humans and animals the ethics of laboratory testing or the inhumanity of zoos.) If that ending conveyed the heady rush of liberatory zeal we associate with the French Revolution the current installment Matt Reeves Dawn of the Planet of the Apes documents the French Revolutions chilling second phase the Reign of Terror when the fiercest zealots of the revolution became among the most rigid enforcers of its new and increasingly bloody rule of law. Like that second revolutionary phase Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is something of a comedown being considerably grimmer more violent and less idealistic than its predecessor. But thanks to Serkis (and a supporting cast of ape characters animated as much by the performers who play them as by the WETA workshops digital magic) Dawn still manages to be one of the most intelligent and entertaining big-studio releases of the summer so far. Have you noticed I havent yet mentioned any of the human characters by name? Advertisement In the 10 years since Caesars revolt--which left him and his comrades starting a new ape society from scratch in the redwood forest of Muir Woods--a deadly simian virus has swept the planet eliminating much of the human population and leading to wars and riots that have destroyed the earths electric grid. A band of surviving humans attempting to make repairs to a hydroelectric dam to restore power makes accidental contact with the ape culture which has developed writing and somehow tamed the horse even though humanlike articulate speech is just beginning to supplement the apes beautifully evoked gestural communication system translated in subtitles. The few glimpses we get of the apes nascent civilization--a hillside of thatched cottages female foreheads adorned with crude beads a sort of schoolroom where young apes learn the first commandment of their species (""Ape Not Kill Ape"")--made me long for an Apes sequel with more Jane Goodall-like opportunities to observe primate culture in its pre-contact state. Instead the film (scripted by Mark Bomback Amanda Silver and Rick Jaffa) seems in a rush to establish that apes have established a complex and peaceable culture in order to get on with the scenes--and there are many--in which that way of life is spectacularly and violently destroyed. If the 2011 Apes was an origin story and a loss-of-innocence parable Dawn is a straight-up war film with a story that alternates an escalating series of ape/human battles with scenes of intra-species conflict and betrayal in both worlds. Have you noticed I havent yet mentioned any of the human characters by name? Thats because theyre so generic and undifferentiated theyre hard to keep straight. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) is a former architect who lost his wife to the simian virus; after the ape society is contacted he leads the first diplomatic mission into ape territory bonding enough with Caesar to broker a fragile truce. He has a girlfriend (Keri Russell) who is a nurse and a teenage son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) both of whom serve mainly as ape-bait in suspense scenes (though Russells medical skills do come in handy when the conflict worsens). Back at the humans heavily fortified HQ in San Francisco theres also Gary Oldman as a megaphone-wielding organizer of the citys surviving population. At first he appears sane enough but by the time he starts advocating all-out human-on-ape warfare with the species-ist justification (always issued at top volume) that ""THEYRE ANIMALS"" you understand Oldmans character is there to represent humanity at its most narrow-minded and bellicose. The ape world has its own intolerant rabble-rouser in Koba (Toby Kebbell) an old colleague of Caesars from his lab-rebellion days who becomes the despotic leader of a violent splinter movement within ape society that comes to include among others Caesars ambivalent son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston). The ideological divide between Caesar and Koba finds echoes in struggles taking place around the world right now in the Middle East and elsewhere. And Caesars despair as he sees the community hes founded betraying its own ideals cant help but evoke (at times heavy-handedly) Shakespeare Greek tragedy even Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes furry-brow-furrowing over quandaries of political and social injustice doesnt extend to gender issues Females in this story whether human or ape exist mainly to nurture give birth and look pretty in peril. It feels like a real step back to see Keri Russell--who as the undercover Russian superspy of The Americans seems tough enough to pose a one-woman threat to Western democracy--reduced to dispensing encouraging hugs and makeshift bandages. And in all the sad annals of Judy Greer wastage has this gifted actress ever been more squandered than she is as Cornelia Caesars silent flower-adorned adorable newborn-toting mate? (At least in those Sprint ""framily"" ads she gets to speak if only to a less-than-Weta-worthy talking hamster.) But the new ape society--and the rebooted Apes franchise--have just begun their inexorable rise. To judge by the final close-up on Caesars steely eyes the coming chapter seems likely to be even more warlike. Heres hoping the next ape uprising will be matriarchal in nature.

"Monkey See << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Inside U.S. Soccer  Next Man vs. Machine Facebook Twitter Print Movies Monkey See Dont miss out on Dawn of the Planet of the Apes by Wesley Morris on July 11 2014 And so into the city they rode on horseback with machine guns and exposed fangs and grunts and stood with spears atop rusting cable cars looking first for something like peace and later for war. The place is San Francisco the horsemen apes and the line vague between whats real and whats computer-made. But you surrender to the point where youre no longer aware of the digital wizardry. Maybe you know that Andy Serkis is ""playing"" the apes leader Caesar. On the one hand youre watching the computer-generated synthesis of a very good very particular sort of acting with state-of-the-art technology. On the other youre watching the Meryl Streep of motion-capture technology. You experience wonder and a reasonable approximation of dread. Seeing scores of monkeys pulling on reins forces you to accept the inversion of order and maybe breathe a sigh of relief. Its not as if theyre riding us. Not yet. But thats the unstated tension in these new Planet of the Apes movies Were this close to being their monkeys. The series started in 1968 as a Charlton Heston vehicle that used its interspecies strife to mirror all kinds of political strife outside the theater. Tim Burton tried to resurrect it in 2001 without really knowing why. The movies came fully back to life in 2011 when Rise of the Planet of the Apes posed moral and ethical concerns to the animal-testing corner of the medical community by dramatizing the stress of life as a science project. It was a horror movie -- a sensitive intelligent outraged suspenseful one with disturbingly good visual effects -- that started as a family film a doctor searching for a cure to his fathers Alzheimers works for a company that goes too far. Eventually the projects strike back and then out into the forest where a decade later in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes theyve evolved in a nice if rainy fiefdom. As for Homo sapiens the search for that cure unleashed a virus that has decimated most of the world. Whats left of San Franciscos population is now packed into Fort Point. Humans are languishing in primitivity while the apes are wrestling with more civilized concerns. Caesars biggest headache is his rebellious adolescent son. The elder ape enjoys deep subtitled sign-language discussions about humans with his friend Koba. They pat their bodies and paint the air as Caesar says that he remains ambivalent toward people and Koba says that he does not. They were tortured which is unforgivable. Their philosophical differences remain theoretical until some men (Jason Clarke Kirk Acevedo Kodi Smit-McPhee) and a woman (Keri Russell) come trespassing in the woods. (Gary Oldman holds down the fort in San Francisco.) One guy gets aggravated and antsy and shoots one of the apes. Its just a wound but this is the sort of deliriously detail-oriented production that invites you to detect exasperated worry in the folds of Caesars brow. ""Here we go"" he and Koba seem to say -- but in opposition to each other. The trespassers from San Francisco have come looking for a dam that will restore the citys electricity easing life in their compound perhaps connecting them to the outside world and with any luck to their Apple products. The humans request for help ignites a debate among the apes. Koba argues that in the long run compassion will lead to conquest and the conquest will lead to war. He has a point and not because hes the hawk to Caesars dove but because dominion is what humans do. What follows is a fight for electrical military and physical power one that sees the apes eventually armed and massed. This is the first Hollywood movie since Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith to make certain kinds of gun ownership seem insane. A chimp on a horse is strange. A chimp on a horse holding an AK-47 is nuts. (The climax of the new Transformers movie has a similar incongruity trucks riding dinosaurs. And thats inane At the very least it should be the other way around.) In any case the animals have taken on a human militancy and the movie lets the scariness of the transition sink in. The apes are guerrillas. A different film -- an apocalyptic commentary on bellicosity and assimilation and how the Centers for Disease Control cannot hold -- might have gone for a gag about apes horses and guns like dogs playing poker. The apes might have found a television and DVD player and in the player would have been a Die Hard movie or one of those John Wayne cavalry Westerns and when Koba arrived at Fort Point his horse would have reared up and he would have said something like ""Yippee ki-yay."" But the movie goes for the surrealism of the image and not the joke. Youll think of the Wild West no matter what. But now you might think of the Middle East too. The factionalism and murderous revenge roiling that part of the world has spiked in the last month and a half. It should feel crass to pay money to watch an expensive version of that in an air-conditioned multiplex but it seems as if lawlessness division war insurgency supremacism and vengeance are all over the movies this spring and summer. In that fourth Transformers installment yes and Snowpiercer too -- but chaotic unrest drives that second Captain America movie and Edge of Tomorrow and shows up in films as seemingly benign as Maleficent and How to Train Your Dragon 2. These movies are different from the ones of past seasons which saw blockbusters wishfully graft toys and superheroes onto the iconography of the September 11 attacks in films like the third Transformers Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel. Before 9/11 when Hollywood wanted to do terrorism it had a bad guy blow something up (or threaten to) and then ask for a lot of money and a helicopter. This scenario made Bruce Willis and Keanu Reeves stars. But increasingly the bad guy is some kind of idea or power structure. In Snowpiercer its class warfare. In Maleficent its gender. In some of these movies human beings -- American human beings -- wind up in the way of other species. In Transformers Age of Extinction we just drop stuff on more stuff which is more or less true in Godzilla too. Big American movies at the moment are no longer about American might. Theyre more about ambivalence more about ""maybe."" Maybe Tom Cruise can save the world. Hell just need to get killed a thousand times to do it. Hes dying really hard. Snowpiercer features an international resistance army only partially led by an American. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is an entire movie about how Americans arent the center of the universe. Its the end of the world in San Francisco Anybody could be from anywhere. The movie doesnt treat this reshuffling with anything like anxiety. The humans wind up helping the apes in whats effectively a civil war as additives just as the humans do in that Transformers movie. Koba and his militia discover from humans the ecstasy of guns Theyre easier than diplomacy. Theyre easier than killing with your own brute strength. But under Caesars command theyre made to seem a cowardly instrument. Hollywood chillers and science fiction films like to propagandize against competitive advances in technology -- television and VCRs and the Internet (Poltergeist The Ring Transcendence). But heres a movie that makes a point to consider the enduring attraction to and danger of a much older weapon. At some point Koba puts his gun down to teach himself to drive a tank. It doesnt take long -- enough time for the camera to make a chilling 360-or-so-degree pivot along with the turret. Weve passed the exploratory science of Charles Darwin and into the violence X-rays of Hannah Arendt. The director is Matt Reeves who did Cloverfield and helped turn the Swedish vampire movie Let the Right One In into the overstyled overly conceptual 2010 remake. Reeves has a good screenplay by Mark Bomback Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver that allows him to take his time to build the story around the faces of the primates incarnations of chimps and gorillas and one orangutan with a cast-iron skillet for a face. The movie also has a perfectly used thriller score by Michael Giacchino and editing that flatters the work that went into orchestrating the blend of live action and animation. The fighting is navigable. Michael Bay is a director who could also be doing this with effects and ideas and combat. He could make Apocalypse Now or Jarhead one of the most underrated movies of the last 40 years. But right now hes too taken with the kick of destruction to call into question the urge to obliterate. Its like telling a two-pack-a-day smoker to quit. Good luck with that. Reeves is another of those good young directors who at the moment is spinning in the revolving door of recycled and remade products. He can make the overhauls seem original enough. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes gets to be exciting and to say something about the world instead of merely blowing it up. The apes are among the more intellectually complex characters youre likely to spend time with this summer. A lot of care and imagination have been lavished on the creation of their world. And in Caesar theyve invented an exciting heroic character that you find yourself rooting for. The kick of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is its unadulterated belief in the kind of leadership thats worrying other movies at the moment. Caesars humanism is a touch naive but his idealism is a source of strength -- what allows him to be a good husband father friend and commander. Kobas wary pragmatism makes all the sense in the world. Then it tips into a kind of senselessness. Waiting for Caesar to restore order I experienced an impatience that I havent felt since the first Superman movie Hurry up and save the world. This is a fake monkey but the urge to let him protect us feels intensely real. An earlier version of this article erroneously stated that Kobas son was shot by the humans; the victim was a different ape.

By Peter Rainer Film critic July 11 2014 Save for later Saved Dawn of the Planet of the Apes stars Jason Clarke (second from l.) with the character of Caesar (l.) portrayed by Andy Serkis Koba (second from l.) portrayed by Toby Kebbell and Maurice (r.) played by Karin Konoval. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide One of the better sequels to issue from Hollywoods franchise frenzy ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a thinking persons fantasy film. Whats remarkable about it is that it doesnt seem like a fantasy at all.The film begins in the long aftermath to the ape escape in 2011s ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" when a simian virus killed most of Earths population. Caesar the hero chimp from that film is now the head of an advanced tribe of apes (and gorillas orangutans and bonobos) living in the wilds of northern California. A band of human survivors has assembled in San Francisco at a weapons armory while attempting to locate a dam in ape territory with which they hope to restore power. Interspecies warfare is the inevitable result.Director Matt Reeves and his screenwriters Mark Bomback Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver go in for a lot of socially conscious dramaturgy about the need for interspecies tolerance which will probably earn the film merit badges from those critics who like their sci-fi accompanied by a dollop of instruction. I could have done with a bit less of this but then again the first (and still arguably the best) of the series ""Planet of the Apes"" went in for it too. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Whats striking about this new film is that it lays out the message-mongering in such a way that you can enjoy the movie equally well on a purely action level. Andy Serkis who plays the worldly-wise Caesar is extraordinary as always; so is Toby Kebbell as Koba Caesars human-hating rival. (In joke Koba was the name Stalin assumed for himself in his early party days.) The human players including Jason Clarke Keri Russell and Gary Oldman cant help but come across as second-best to these apes as good as those actors are. Whether the apes are grunting speaking in sign language or talking in English they rule. Grade B+ (Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and brief strong language.)

The few hundred humans -- genetically immune survivors of a simian flu that has wiped out most of their kind -- have gathered in a San Francisco compound where theyre now out of the power they need to ""rebuild and reclaim the world [they] lost."" The apes you see reside where said power is beside a dam -- hence the conflict. One nasty human played by Gary Oldman (nice casting) has a thing against apes and is especially keen on wiping them out. One nasty ape Koba (Toby Kebbel plus CGI) has a similar thing against humans which makes sense since once upon a time they did hideous experiments on him. The sane ones are Caesar the leader and most verbal of the apes played by Andy Serkis plus CGI; and a human Malcolm played by Jason Clarke as convincing a good guy as he was torturing Iraqis in Zero Dark Thirty. It takes a while for Caesar and Malcolm to trust each other and by the time they do the odds are long that theyll keep a full-scale war from breaking out. The new film directed by Matt Reeves (Let Me In) is a follow up to Rupert WyattsA Rise of the Planet of the Apes and the question hangs whether the new series is building to the latest incarnation of Charlton Heston landing on a monkey planet or something more upbeat.A I should say that Dawn despite the loss of billions of humans is among the sunniest in a series that in one installment featured the incineration of the entire planet. The nihilist vision has been there from the start. This one at least has a humanist (or perhaps out of deference to the peaceable apes we should say pacifist) thrust and offers some hope however fleeting that monkey and man can reach across the evolutionary chasm. It is certainly thrilling to see how Reeves and his CGI wizards bring their hordes of apes to life. Honestly if I didnt know they were computerized Id have thought theyd brought off an evolutionary miracle. Serkis in particular affects a good simian stance -- arms slightly raised at his sides teeth bared flat nostrils in the air and barking his lines a la Toshiro Mifune. Caesar is sad that some humans are gone -- he misses James Franco and John Lithgow who in Rise romped with him and taught him chess and tried to protect him from probes being thrust into his fundament. But hes properly on guard as an emperor must be. The scene in which Malcolm is led -- accompanied by Michael Giacchinos grand scary music which pays suitable homage to Jerry Goldsmith -- past animal carcasses displayed like talismans to what is Caesars treetop throne room is magnificent. Dawn is a triumph of design and animation. As usual with these big-budget behemoths there are five climaxes and not much to do for the likes of Keri Russell (as Clarkes squeeze) and the delectable Judy Greer whos apparently somewhere underneath one of the apes. One of the best scenes is when Koba does a hilarious ape-Stepin Fetchit act for two drunken human artillery nuts before blowing them away but there arent many laughs beyond that. Even given the spate of post-apocalyptic and dystopian films that rule the multiplexes this is the bleakest ""franchise"" in human history and Im curious if there will be any balm whatsoever in the next close encounter of the furred kind.

Dave McGinn The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 11 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 11 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Matt Reeves Written by Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver and Matt Bomback Starring Andy Serkis Jason Clarke Gary Oldman and Keri Russell Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English Of all the riches and distractions at the box office this summer - the cocky charm of 22 Jump Street the tantalizing prospect of Days of Future Past an X-Men adaptation of one of the most groundbreaking comics in history the giant spectacle of Godzilla even the clanging stupidity of Transformers - this is the movie Ive most been looking forward to. And good news - its incredible. It sets the standard for blockbuster action movies and manages to be even better than its predecessor. Three years ago if you had told me a Planet of The Apes prequel starring James Franco would be one of the most enjoyable movies of that year I would have questioned your marbles. It wouldnt quite be Charlton Heston raving at a gun rally level bonkers. But still questionable. The original franchise is remembered for devolving into cheesy sci-fi even if that final image in the first film from 1968 of the Statue of Liberty will keep blowing the minds of stoned undergrads till the end of time. And remember Tim Burtons horrid attempt at reviving the franchise? Me neither thankfully. Plus Franco?In 2011 Rise of the Planet of the Apes worked. Director Rupert Wyatt knew we were all familiar enough with the basic mythology that he didnt have to beat us over the head with it. Unlike so many other summer movies it treated audiences as if they were at least as smart as monkeys (please Michael Bay take note). Most surprisingly it made filmgoers root for the apes as much as any human.Wyatt isnt in the directors chair for this sequel. Hes been replaced by Matt Reeves best known for the monster movie Cloverfield. Franco is gone too. But screenwriters Rick Jaffaa and Amanda Silver who penned Rise are back and joined by and Mark Bomback.Together they continue to avoid any easy moralizing. Instead there is nobility among both humans and apes as well as a few snakes in the grass.Credit Andy Serkis who plays ape leader Caesar and a digital effects crew that makes him and his world feel entirely real for nailing a performance that gives what could be a silly campy movie so much gravitas. He deserves a best actor nomination from the Oscars.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes opens 10 years after the events of the prequel. A simian flu has wiped out most of humanity. Caesar and the apes have built a colony in the woods north of San Francisco that the ape leader now a middle-aged father wants to protect at all costs.Their idyllic existence is interrupted when a group of humans are caught in the woods. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) his love interest Ellie (Keri Russell) his son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and an angry hothead named Carver (Kirk Acevedo) are trying to reach a hydroelectric dam in the hopes of fixing it and restoring power to a portion of San Francisco where a small colony of humans lives among the ruins.Caesar agrees to help them but warring factions on both sides - including Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) who is preparing an arsenal in San Francisco to protect his fellow humans and Koba (Toby Kebbell) an ape who wants revenge for being kept in a cage - will trigger betrayals and a broken truce.Reeves is just as adept at directing the small quiet moments between apes and humans as he is with the films action set pieces. In one charming scene Alexander sits down with an ape to read Charles Burnss graphic novel Black Hole a nice touch to anyone familiar with that story of a mysterious disease.When all hell breaks loose its riveting and emotionally charged in part because viewers have connected with both sides. You know what youre seeing is real tragedy. But this is a big-budget summer-action flick after all. So when theres an angry ape charging down the street atop a horse with two machine guns blazing youre whipped up into a frenzy of over-the-top summer movie mayhem giddiness.Reeves plays to the popcorn audiences but he doesnt pander to them. He doesnt load us up with a bunch of idiotic nonsense and easy moralizing and hope we wont notice with all the bombs going off and bullets whizzing by.Most summer action movies probably expect to get away with it because no one really thinks Transformers or Avengers are real so directors crank up the klabooey while we strap in for the ride.Thats a disservice to audiences one that is paying diminishing returns in a marketplace glutted with franchises.This is a movie that feels real from its CGI renderings of an ape marveling at his newborn son to its emotions to its moral tragedies.You dont get that much at the big budget box office these days. We deserve more of them.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1230am on Friday Jul. 11 2014 Friday Jul. 11 2014 Friday Jul. 11 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram The original ""Planet of the Apes"" franchise was evolution in reverse. The kickoff film with Charlton Heston was smart cool just a bit campy and sported that shock ending that -- spoiler alert -- showed that just because man had less hair than his simian overlords didnt mean he had more brains.From there it was the law of diminishing returns with a parade of lackluster sequels seemingly the ultimate proof that some films should just be left alone.But the reboot gives lie to all that evolving and adapting to the times while keeping alive the spirit that made that first film in 1968 -- and the French novel on which it was based -- such a science-fiction firestarter. The new series began in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatts vision of the spark -- a scientist developing a drug for Alzheimers -- that led to the apes rapid escalation in intelligence. It was a film that a lot of people didnt have much hope for -- James Franco? Monkeys? -- especially in light of Tim Burtons failed take on a new Apes saga in 2001.Yet Rise was much better than what most envisioned and now Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is better still.Its some time after the apes from the last movie have freed themselves from their Bay Area research labs rioted on the Golden Gate Bridge and taken refuge in a Northern California forest. Human civilization has collapsed after a virus has decimated most of the population. But a group of resistant survivors in San Francisco -- led by Malcolm (the always reliable Jason Clarke Zero Dark Thirty) and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) -- is trying to rebuild if only they could get electricity again and perhaps reach out to others huddled in small terrified groups around the globe.In order to do that they need to get a nearby dam working again but as luck would have it its right in the middle of ape territory which is overseen by Caesar (the incredible Andy Serkis) the chimp who was the instigator in the last film. What the humans dont know is that the apes are continuing to evolve at a record pace mastering primitive speech riding horses and setting up something of a civil society where ""ape not kill ape.""Unless of course that ape is on a power trip which is the case with Koba (Toby Kebbell) who hates humanity intensely and bears the scars from his time as a research chimp to prove it. So when Malcolm and his crew stumble upon Caesars ape city Caesar is willing to compromise and let them have access to the dam -- the humans seem desperate he says -- while Koba wants to charge into whats left of San Francisco and kill them all.This ape-on-ape conflict is mirrored in the human world between peacemaker Malcolm and the more militant Dreyfus and especially hothead former dam worker/No. 1 ape-hater Carver (Kirk Acevedo). Of course these simmering feuds detonate into an all-out showdown. But director Matt Reeves ( Let Me In Cloverfield) keeps us invested in the emotional journey even if we know the destination.Sure Malcolms family -- his concerned wife Ellie (Keri Russell) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) -- and many of the human supporting players are stock characters. But they dont distract from the films momentum.As a technical achievement Dawn is a marvel. Serkis and all the other actors under layers of makeup manage to show a range of emotions while the meshing of real and CGI is seamless.Yes the whole thing is a setup for another sequel already set for summer 2016. Yes its Hollywood at its most manipulative. Still Heston would hate to hear this as he cries in front of what used to the Statue of Liberty but at least from a moviegoers perspective the coming ape-ocracy may be nothing to fear and something to champion after all.

"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes ) Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (United States 2014) July 10 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not only a solid dystopian-flavored science fiction film in its own right but it elevates the stock of its immediate predecessor in the Planet of the Apes franchise Rise of the Planet of the Apes. By adding to the ongoing storyline and propelling it forward Dawn of the Planet of the Apes transforms the rushed ending of the 2011 film into a pause rather than an awkward stopping point. This installment inches events closer to a merge point with 1968s Planet of the Apes while maintaining its own unique identity. It is in every way superior to Rise of the Planet of the Apes. The narrative is structured like a Shakespearean tragedy; it wouldnt be too much of a stretch to say that Julius Caesar is an inspiration (for obvious reasons). As is the case with the other Planet of the Apes movies the story is allegorical but theres no sense of preaching or heavy-handedness. The movie makes its points about the destructiveness of racial hatred in an organic fashion. And unlike Rise of the Planet of the Apes which did a poor job developing the human characters Dawn of the Planet of the Apes fleshes out personalities for both the people and the apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes begins an unspecified period after the conclusion of its predecessor. Humankind ravaged by a virus and the lawlessness that arose in its wake has lost its position of prominence atop the global food chain. The collapse of civilization has resulted in a fragmented primitive society; a band in San Francisco under the leadership of two survivors Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) struggles to regain some of what was lost. Their immediate goal is to restore the power grid; to do that however they must venture into Muir Woods where the Apes still led by Caesar (Andy Serkis) have become increasingly advanced and sophisticated. Caesar has learned speech (a skill soon mastered by others). Men and apes clash and while the moderate elements in each species struggle to broker an agreement to promote mutual cooperation and forestall a war the more extreme elements seek only one thing the annihilation of their opponents. Its refreshing to see a big-budget summer movie thats more interested in telling a story than cluttering up the screen with explosions and deadening the mind with a lobotomized spectacle. Thats not to say Dawn of the Planet of the Apes lacks visual flair. In fact it features some of the best special effects in any recent motion picture. Not for a moment will anyone doubt that the apes are real. Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) keeps the camera mobile but not in a way thats likely to induce motion sickness. He favors long sweeping shots and occasionally employs atypical points-of-view. This allows Dawn of the Planet of the Apes to boast a fresh look; it doesnt feel like a clone of every other summer tent pole motion picture. A few words must be written about Andy Serkis contribution. The unsung actor who has given life to such memorable characters as Gollum and King Kong deserves a lions share of the credit for making Ceasar the most compelling character in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Caesar is a remarkable creation - the melding of human acting and computer generated imagery. Its noteworthy that this iteration of the character has emerged from the long shadow cast by Roddy McDowell who played Caesar in two of the early 1970s Planet of the Apes movies (Conquest and Battle). One can argue whether Serkis is deserving of a Best Actor nomination for his work here but his overall importance to genre films since the turn of the century is undeniable and some kind of special Oscar is unquestionably deserved. People dont make their first appearance in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes until 15 minutes have elapsed. The films early scenes focus on establishing the ape characters and their society. In addition to Caesar key simian players include Maurice the orangutan; Caesars grown son Blue Eyes; and the embittered Koba. The humans are represented by Malcolm and his compatriots Ellie (Keri Russell) Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and Carver (Kirk Acevedo). The filmmakers cannily give each human a scene designed to provide depth and breadth to an initially one-dimensional character. With Oldmans Dreyfus for example theres a poignant moment in which his computer returns to life for the first time since the apocalypse and hes able to view photographs of his dead family. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes contains action - there is a lengthy battle sequence that absorbs about 20% of the running time - but this is more about world building and storytelling than it is about mixing adrenaline and testosterone cocktails. Especially during the first hour the movie takes its time. It doesnt rush headlong into the central conflict. This chapter ends on a satisfying (if downbeat) note that promises another sequel. Perhaps most importantly Dawn of the Planet of the Apes becomes the first Planet of the Apes movie made in the last 45 years to merit mention alongside the original in terms of storytelling aptitude and big screen prowess.

Starring Gary Oldman Keri Russell and Andy Serkis. (Photo/Video 20th Century Fox) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com July 10 2014 142 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is an extremely high-functioning sci-fi thriller about extremely high-functioning apes. Some of it may seem silly in the recounting or in the trailer but it doesnt feel silly in the theater. Far from it the film forges ahead in vivid 3-D with such energy expertise and thunderous conviction that you readily accept its basic premise--the pell-mell emergence of great intelligence plus moral awareness in primitive bodies--and find yourself exactly where the filmmakers want you to be swinging giddily between sympathy for the apes and the humans in what threatens to become all-out war. More Reviews Boyhood Land Ho The previous edition of this apparently imperishable franchise ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" came as a nice surprise albeit an erratic one--an affecting Frankenstein myth set at first in the laboratories of a large pharmaceutical corporation intertwined with a family drama about a hard-charging scientist trying to find a cure for Alzheimers. This production is more surprising since its equally smart in a different style and even more powerful as an action piece though overlong--and a bit erratic--at 130 minutes. (Matt Reeves directed boldly and zestfully from an audacious script by Mark Bomback Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver. Michael Giacchino did the music. The production was designed by James Chinlund and photographed by Michael Seresin.) It wasnt looking good for us humans at the end of the last film what with an ape prodigy named Caesar leading his simian troops in a rebellion against our befuddled species and it looks worse for us when ""Dawn"" begins. A simian flu has decimated humankind. A few survivors with immunity to the disease are barely holding out in San Francisco against hordes of apes who have learned a thing or two in the interim. (One thing is spoken English which they use in conjunction with sign language that the film helpfully subtitles. Another thing is competence with weapons from spears to automatic rifles.) Our side includes Keri Russell--always a plus--Gary Oldman and Jason Clarkes resourceful Malcolm a former architect whose heroics ring true with overtones of strength and kindness that reminded me of Paul Newman. The apes are led yet again by Caesar who is motion-captured yet again by the Bard of Body Language Andy Serkis. Visually sumptuous with digital effects supervised by the wizardly Joe Letteri the production is also politically adventurous. Caesar is a visionary who understands the need for peace but his leadership is challenged by a classically thuggish underling. Some of the apes like some of the humans are unworthy of their species. One of them is so deliciously devious that he shucks and jives like a craven minstrel while spying on the humans arms cache. I told you this would sound silly in the retelling and Ill risk making it--or myself--sound more so by adding that Caesar has a tragic sense of the impending combat. ""Hes more than just an ape"" Malcolm says admiringly. This is more than just an ape movie.

Without them there would be no story to tell no movie to make yet some of the most ardent film buffs would be hard-pressed to connect such masters as Frank S. Nugent Ernest Lehman I.A.L. Diamond or Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett with beloved movies they wrote (respectively The Searchers North by Northwest Some Like It Hot and Its a Wonderful Life). If I rattled off the writers whove contributed over the years to the Planet of the Apes franchise youd probably draw a blank on all of them except Rod Serling--who was of course a TV personality introducing his own and others stories on The Twilight Zone.

(AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation) Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT After a global pandemic apes and humans go to war. Rated PG-13. BOTTOM LINE The shock and awe of the first film is gone replaced by overwrought drama and lengthy inter-ape conversations. With subtitles yet. CAST Andy Serkis Jason Clarke Gary Oldman Keri Russell LENGTH 207 In the summer of 2011 moviegoers greeted ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" with low expectations. After Tim Burtons botched reboot of the beloved franchise who wanted another? But ""Rise"" turned out to be a stunner vigorously directed by Rupert Wyatt and anchored by Andy Serkis motion-capture performance as the intelligent ape Caesar. It was that rarest of breeds the top-notch popcorn flick. The sequel ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" arrives with high expectations and falls far below them. Gone are the thrilling action sequences of the first film replaced by heavy-handed drama and inter-ape power struggles. The tone is dire the visuals dark and doomy the pace epically slow. Like so many sequels its everything the first film aspired not to be. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? ""Dawn"" tackles the franchises enduring themes -- mans capacity for destruction and the apocalypse it surely portends -- but with little visual imagination or humor. Set in the aftermath of a ""simian flu"" pandemic ""Dawn"" introduces us to a colony of humans living in whats left of San Francisco. A power plant lies nearby but heres the catch Its within the territory of Caesar and his tribe of human-hating apes. The story feels more like ""Avatar"" than an ""Apes"" movie. A human family played by Jason Clarke Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee wants to work peacefully with Caesar but colony-leader Dreyfus (a very good Gary Oldman) wants war. Meanwhile Caesars throne is threatened by the mutinous bonobo Koba (an aggressively physical Toby Kebbell). Which of these closely-related species will dominate? New director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"") treats this material as seriously as a Shakespeare play albeit with motion-capture apes and big-budget pyrotechnics. The films confusion is evident in the wretched subtitles which translate simian sign language. The apes apparently have two rhetorical styles barbarian-grandiloquent (""We will avenge your fathers death"") or California-colloquial (""Are you OK?""). The dialogue is so stilted that ""Dawn"" sometimes recalls a dubbed Kung-Fu movie. 131 MoviesRafers review Dawn of the Planet of the Apes ""Dawn"" may not yet spell doom for the ""Apes"" franchise. But what started out feeling so fresh and exciting is heading into disappointingly familiar territory. advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT After a global pandemic apes and humans go to war.

"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is this summers best brainiest blockbuster review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesDawn of the Planet of the Apes is this summers best brainiest blockbuster reviewLets not monkey around Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best and brainiest blockbuster of the summer the kind of movie you hope for when you pay your money and buy your popcorn. By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 10 2014Dawn of the Planet of the ApesStarring Andy Serkis Jason Clarke Gary Oldman Keri Russell Toby Kebbell and Kodi Smit-McPhee. Directed by Matt Reeves. At GTA theatres. 130 minutes. PGLets not monkey around Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the best and brainiest blockbuster of the summer the kind of movie you hope for when you pay your money and buy your popcorn. It restores hope for event films after the recent trampling administered by Michael Bays big dumb and cynicalTransformers Age of Extinction.Article Continued BelowIn title and spirit Dawn of the Planet of the Apes evokes the ""Dawn of Man"" opening sequence of Stanley Kubricks 2001 A Space Odyssey an obvious influence on director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield Let Me In). In the Kubrick movie as in this one the introduction of calculating thought and destructive weaponry bring drastic change to peaceful simian lives -- and by extension human ones too. Andy Serkis reprises his motion-capture role as Caesar in a Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Its impossible to tell where the human ends and the animal begins says movie critic Peter Howell. (Twentieth Century Fox)  This is a sequel to Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) which itself was the prequel to a sci-fi franchise that began with Planet of the Apes in 1968 and which had burned out through multiple extensions and remakes.Rise was one of the more pleasant cinema surprises of recent years showing how some fresh thinking could revive an old idea. Dawn builds on this picking up the story about a decade after mankind has been devastated by a simian flu unleashed at the same time as chemically engineered smart apes have revolted against their human oppressors.The star of the show as before is Andy Serkis as lead ape Caesar. He does motion-capture performance so well conveying volumes with his battle-weary eyes its impossible to tell where the human ends and the animal begins. It would be a real shame if the Oscar Academy couldnt find some way to recognize the unique talents of this very deserving actor who has previously dazzled with his portrayals of Gollum from Tolkien lore and the title ape from the 2005 King Kong remake. Caesar is the most intellectually and emotionally evolved of the apes having grown not just as a rebel and leader but now also as a father and family figure.Along with acquiring the power of speech hes also developed empathy that most desired of all personality traits. He can understand the need of the surviving band of humans -- led by Zero Dark Thirtys Jason Clarke and Batmans Gary Oldman -- to restore some order to desperate lives by reactivating a hydro power plant located in ape territory in the forests outside a ruined San Francisco. (The forests are magnificently provided by British Columbia where much of the movie was filmed.)Caesar just wants peace between humans and apes as do the more thoughtful members of both species ""Home family future"" is Caesars motto one he expresses hopefully but with full awareness of threats that could shatter dreams. And there are violent forces of dissent in both camps not just the expected unease between apes and humans but also distrust and betrayal within the ape and human realms. A lieutenant of Caesars named Koba (Toby Kebbell) grows suspicious of humans and impatient of his leaders pacifist views while on the Homo sapiens side of the species divide Oldmans Dreyfus a former lawman readies the heavy artillery for the ape attack he fears is inevitable.Not all humans think this way. Clarkes Malcolm used to be an architect in the pre-Apocalypse world and he wants to build links between humans and apes along with his nurse girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and teen son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Neither human nor ape intelligence matters when the insanity of war erupts.Without driving the point home because it really doesnt need to the movie makes plain the soul-destroying problem to trying to find a lasting peace between disparate tribes when many participants seem to prefer constant battle. Analogies with current conflicts in Africa the Middle East or indeed any other intractable clash of ideologies readily come to mind in the intelligent screenplay credited to Mark Bomback Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver the latter two the married co-writers of Rise of the Planet of the Apes.Yet the thoughtfulness isnt at the expense of action which the movie delivers with impressive 3D and mo-cap power -- at one point theres a panoramic sweep of the battlefield that could take your breath away.If theres any weakness in this otherwise impeccable film its the rather ponderous score by Michael Giacchino which occasionally recalls but doesnt come close to matching Jerry Goldsmiths memorable creation for the original Planet of the Apes in 68. Most movie franchises leave us hoping for less rather than more. The continuing Planet of the Apes prequel series is having the entirely opposite effect which is appropriate for a story about a world turned upside down.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

In a post-apocalyptic battle for dominance over Earth human survivors of a deadly virus face off against an army of highly evolved apes led by Caesar (Andy Serkis). 20th Century Fox Film Corp. Movies Rise Welcomes Earths New Ape Overlords Its the end of the world as we know it and the apes feel fine. As for humanity? Not so much but Dawn of the Planet of the Apes doesnt care so much about their feelings. This dawn is well past mankinds twilight. The excellent 2011 reboot of the Planet of the Apes series ended with a map hinting at the worldwide spread of a man-made contagion. The retrovirus used to make lab apes smart in that film was it turned out deadly to humans. A more generic Hollywood franchise might have followed that film up with mankinds collapse focusing on the chaos of our desperate attempts to keep society intact as the apes grew stronger and smarter and more organized hidden away in the forests. But this sequel is anything but generic. In fact the film skips over the specifics of that collapse almost entirely only referencing it through an opening credits audio montage of news reports describing societys rapid spiral into radio silence. Then director Matt Reeves taking over the franchise from Rise of the Planet of the Apes director Rupert Wyatt drops us into a now well-established ape society a decade down the line. What few humans are left are scattered in desperate colonies in the remains of quarantine centers such as the one run by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) in San Francisco. Things are about to get a whole lot more desperate if they cant get a dam back online to provide power once their fuel runs out so an exploratory team is sent to check on the dam led by Malcolm and Ellie (Jason Clarke and Keri Russell). But that human story is only important inasmuch as it impacts the beings living in the redwoods north of the city between the humans and the dam. There Caesar (Andy Serkis) the previous installments prodigal chimp leads a massive thriving ape colony with classes and leadership structures already intact. Communication is largely via sign language as only a few of them -- Caesar most of all -- have yet developed any capacity for speech. That ends up being the first in a series of gutsy storytelling choices in Dawn of the Planet the Apes for it means that the opening of the movie -- as well as large portions thereafter -- has no human characters onscreen and a whole lot more subtitles than one might expect from a summer blockbuster. But this is blockbuster counterprogramming to the numbing mindlessness of a movie like Transformers just as surely as the less extensively released Snowpiercer was two weeks ago. Not only that but even amid strong entries in this summer season like Godzilla and Edge of Tomorrow its the first big tent-pole film of 2014 that nails everything from start to finish blending thoughtful allegory meaningful science fiction and dazzling action spectacle without a hitch. That success is built on CGI wizardry that takes the motion capture performances by Serkis and the other actors playing apes and transforms them into characters that look and feel just as real as the humans. Rarely does any ape seem like anything other than flesh blood and fur. But as impressive as the technical aspects of the filmmaking are and the performances of the digitized actors they never exist as simply eye candy Theyre always in service of story. That story is able to relegate humans to supporting roles because the apes as the about-to-be-dominant species on the planet face the same choices as any human society themselves with regard to how they treat one another and how they treat their enemies -- and what even constitutes an enemy. If the prior installment dealt allegorically with among other things the right to revolution of violently repressed minorities this one deals just as pointedly with the ethics of war and vengeance and the rewards of mercy. War isnt just inevitable in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes because it makes for a lot of explosions. Its inevitable because its the first reaction to fear for both humans and apes; only those able to find trust beyond their fear of the other are able to develop the tools for peace. Thats headier stuff than one might expect for a movie that also features chimpanzees firing dual machine guns while on horseback or breathtakingly acrobatic hand-to-hand combat atop an unfinished skyscraper. But two chapters into its new life thats exactly what can be expected from this resurrection of the Planet of the Apes.

It also manages to say a thing or two about the hollowness of most summer blockbusters. Why this sequel to a reboot implicitly asks cant more big entertainment resonate with this much thought craft and feeling? Is it that hard? If so why does Dawn make it seem so easy?Maybe its best to just forget about the rule and enjoy this exception. Dawn plays like an interspecies wartime Shakespearean tragedy complete with fragile alliances betrayals of trust and deadly hubris on both sides. Its not afraid to build slowly to let you feel its texture and absorb the stakes. That way when the combat begins it really means something.The action picks up 10 years after the conclusion of 2011s Rise of the Planet of the Apes with an introductory news-media montage that sets the stage. The lab-born virus suggested at the end of that movie has taken its toll.The immune survivors huddle in San Francisco. In nearby Muir Woods the new race of super apes enhanced by the same chemicals that brought humanity down has created a leafy fortress of solitude and relative peace.This would be a good time to marvel at the movies use of performance-capture technology which represents another leap forward from the standard set in the previous movie. Its not just the fluid motion of the mob which is breathtaking in itself. Each ape has its own personality its own facial tics its own dominant emotions. Caesar (Andy Serkis) is the firm but benevolent leader a family ape who still wants to trust those pesky humans. Koba (Toby Kebbell) is the scheming warmonger who wears his deceit on his face. Hes nasty but he has his reasons. The apes are every bit as complicated as the people.Caesars Homo sapiens counterpart is Malcolm played by the laconically intense Jason Clarke. Like the wary emissaries of warring countries Caesar and Malcolm cautiously chart a course toward peace. But their followers have no cause to trust one another and they both have lieutenants eager to destroy what they fear. The spectacle of Dawn works at the service of these intricacies inverting the movie formula weve grown accustomed to accepting around this time of year.Muir Woods the redwood sanctuary just north of San Francisco serves as its own special effect. In daytime shafts of light pierce the treetops. At night it becomes a craggy enchanted forest. The humans covet the woods because it houses a dam that can supply the energy to save the species. For the apes the hideaway is nothing short of home an idyllic buffer from outside menace.War is inevitable; the Planet of the Apes series requires conflict on a mass scale in order to survive and propagate further sequels. But director Matt Reeves and his writers still manage to pull off something extraordinary.In paving the path to battle they create an aching urge for reconciliation rooted firmly in our real-world emotions and experience. We have seen the apes. And they are us. DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (A)Directed by Matt Reeves. PG-13 (intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and brief strong language). 130 mins.

VPCIn San Francisco ground zero for the viral outbreak a ragtag group of survivors is living in post-apocalyptic shock. The city is in ruins. Resources are dwindling electrical power is sputtering out.In contrast nearby Muir Woods looks particularly lush. The forested area is home to an ape civilization marked by honor and brotherhood. Their world is presided over by the principled chimp Caesar (Andy Serkis). The apes are convincingly wrought.When a group of humans on a reconnaissance mission enters the apes domain everything changes in this simian utopia.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYGUIDE USA TODAYs guide to summer moviesSerkis is such a skilled actor -- even as an ape -- and he brings a soulful humanity to Caesar who is easily the hero of the story.The purpose of the humans forest expedition is access to a nearby hydroelectric dam that can provide power to the barely surviving population in San Francisco. On the orders of Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) the leader of the Bay Area survivors Malcolm (Jason Clarke) returns to the woods with girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) to ask Caesar for permission to get to the dam. Wary but compassionate Caesar cooperates in order to keep peace.From there humans and apes associate in way both wondrous and fraught. All the characters have understandable motivations so even villainous acts generate some sympathy.This dystopian installment superbly dials up the tension intensified by Michael Giacchinos evocative musical score.The film is about 15 minutes too long but while it drags slightly in the final third it never gets dull.The apes are a mighty spectacle. Swinging from tree to tree almost in concert they include an array of chimps bonobos gorillas and orangutans. They wield tools draw on caves and use language mostly through signs and occasional spoken words. One of the best scenes comes early on in which the apes hunt elk and face off against a bear.Its a provocative sci-fi action film with dynamite special effects a powerful humanistic theme with echoes of real-life social conflicts and a truly wondrous performance by Serkis.We cant help but cheer for both sides. Or rather we root for a peaceful co-existence.Close-up shot of Serkis intelligent and piercing eyes open and close the film meaningfully. Its not hard to identify with the beleaguered and benevolent primate. Its as if hes peering deep into the audiences soul and searching guardedly for compassion. 109 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 7 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1lXxbvv",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/10/dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review/10635713/,200,dawnoftheplanetoftheapes23,dawnoftheplanetoftheapes,usatoday

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Kristin Tillotson StribKristin When the apocalypse comes were all going to want chimps gorillas and orangutans on our side. With ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" theyve already come to Hollywoods aid. In a lackluster summer for movies this surefire hit should have its producers swinging from the girders. ""Dawn"" is that rare sequel that makes a pretty good predecessor (""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"") seem almost unnecessary. Building on the setup -- a chimpanzee named Caesar acquires human language skills from a loving scientist and leads a band of escaped lab apes to a new free life in the redwood forest outside San Francisco -- it delivers not only more than twice the action but the kind of smart emotionally rewarding story almost never found in standard-issue blockbusters. A lethal virus dubbed ""simian flu"" because it originated in the same lab that experimented on Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his cohorts has decimated the human population leaving only a ragtag band of genetically immune survivors tenuously led by Gary Oldman. Meanwhile deep in the woods Caesar has built an army of loyal followers -- on horseback -- and a family of his own. The little treetop nation lives by the credo ""ape not kill ape"" (dont call them monkeys please; monkeys have tails which apes do not and less-evolved brains). But when some humans cross into ape territory intent on reaching a dam that can restore electrical power to the city bad apples on both sides threaten to set off a massacre as their well-meaning counterparts forge interspecies bonds. Although Jason Clarke turns in a strong performance as top good-guy Malcolm ""Dawn"" features zero A-list stars. By design the humans are strictly B-list compared with the incredibly lifelike CGI-rendered apes -- Caesar his loyalty-torn son and his violent ally Koba whose bloodlust could topple both worlds. We should perhaps be alarmed that the nuanced facial expressions artificially generated on the apes tug at the heartstrings more effectively than those of the human actors. A quibble Would it have killed director Matt Reeves to toss in one female character who does more than breed or reassure and bandage the menfolk? The double whammy of patriarchy in both human and ape camps is needlessly heavy-handed. DAVID JAMES/Twentieth Century Fox Andy Serkis stars as Caesar in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" Sociopolitical analogies beyond the obvious war tropes abound. As the apes swing through the giant trees increasingly agitated by the threat of encroachers with superior resources ""Occupy Redwood"" springs to mind. The gun-control set will claim a resemblance between the slack-jaws hiding behind their semiautomatics and the photos of those open-carry dudes at Target. When the apes get their hairy mitts on the humans weapons stash gun enthusiasts will applaud the upset in the balance of power. In the end the lesson learned for each side is that ""They want what we want -- to survive."" The lead characters in most blockbusters exhibit emotions with impatience at best cartoonish bathos at worst. Lets hope ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is also the dawn of a new type of big movie -- as packed with feeling and intelligence as it is with action and special effects. At the very least it should spur a burst of upper-arm exercises on playground monkey bars everywhere.

Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (PG-13) A war between man and ape with ho-hum results. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/10/2014 Editor rating 2 Yawn of the Planet of the Apes -- excuse me Dawn -- has a big-budget sheen a few terrific action setpieces and some of the most jaw-dropping CGI effects to date You will believe these apes are real (although some of them are actors wearing costumes). So why does the movie feel so dull and pedestrian? Unlike 2011s Rise of the Planet of the Apes which took more than an hour to explain how these chimps developed human intelligence and the capability to speak before setting them loose on the world Dawn jumps right into the thick of things starting 10 years after the end of the first film. The simian flu has wiped out most of the Earths human population. A group of well-armed survivors immune to the disease have built a fortified camp in San Francisco where they lead relatively comfortable lives under the circumstances. In the wilderness near the city the apes have also built a cozy place for themselves. Led by Caesar (played by Andy Serkis the king of motion-capture technology) the animals live in a big condo building made out of trees and stone hunt wildlife for food and lead a near-human existence (Caesars wife is pregnant and about to give birth). They communicate via speech sign language and when necessary bared fangs. Neither group knows of the existence of the other until a team of humans travels into ape territory to repair a broken dam to provide their settlement with electricity. The expedition group is a ragtag band A widower (Jason Clarke) his girlfriend (Keri Russell) a teenager (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and a super annoying guy (Kirk Acevedo) whose only purpose is to complain and whine and constantly cause trouble. Together the group has all the personality of the ensemble cast of The Walking Dead minus 1000. Even the leader played by the always-entertaining Gary Oldman comes off as an ape-phobic bore. When man and ape first meet face to face everything goes surprisingly well until someone pulls out a gun and gives the animals a reason not to trust the homo sapiens (the NRA will definitely not like this movie although it may enjoy all the firearm porn in the film which includes lots of semi-automatic weapons and an awesome tank). There is treachery afoot in both ranks which leads to escalating tensions that finally result in war. Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield Let Me In) has a way of shooting sprawling action that allows you to take it in via 360 degrees with long shots and inventive camera setups. Hes a great craftsman and he has a terrific eye. But the script by Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback makes the same mistake the previous Apes film made Although this time the focus is on Caesar instead of James Franco the movie still feels sluggish and long-winded taking forever to get to situations that are telegraphed way in advance. Enough cannot be said of Serkis performance as Caesar who manages to express a huge range of emotions with little dialogue (you always know what hes thinking). But hes the emotional focus of the film not the humans and relating to a computer-generated animal that relieves itself in the woods is hard (I did however often wonder how bad that ape village must smell). In an era where films are increasingly shot on green screen soundstages the movie has a tactile on-location feel and there are instances of humor such as a scene in which an ape pretends to act like a buffoon in order to relieve two guards of their rifles. Watching an army of apes riding horses heading into battle is undeniably cool but thats the only thing the movie gives you Neat eye candy. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is written at a level so low even 8- year-olds will find it lacking and because another sequel is already in pre-production theres not much suspense as to how this one is going to end. The opportunity to make a comment on tribalism or wartime occupation or the fragile nature of peace are all outside the reach of this cartoonish film. The key to 1968s Planet of the Apes was watching Charlton Heston interacting with his captors in a world that had gone topsy-turvy and learning the rules of that strange society. In Dawn you just sit through the boring talking parts and wait for ape mayhem to break loose which it does (complete with a climactic giant explosion of course). But its too little too late. Theres so much potential here left on the table in favor of popcorn thrills Im already dreading the inevitable Day.

Updated July 30 2016  1053 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews A bright new Dawn for aggravated apes By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com 314-340-8344 Joe Williams Jul 10 2014 (...) At the Peoples Film Academy in Pyongyang N.D. I learned that every movie has hidden meanings from ""Jingle All the Way"" to ""Jersey Boys."" But only a monkeys uncle could miss the message behind ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" Spay or neuter your pets lest they learn to talk and make you feel guilty about your lifestyle.Ten years after the events in 2011s ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" the human population has been decimated by a viral epidemic. Genetically enhanced apes roam the redwood forests of northern California using horses and spears to hunt herds of elk. The apes raise their kids in harmony with nature and communicate in sign language that is similar to what we see in old Westerns.The chief is Caesar (motion-captured by Andy Serkis) who was educated by scientist James Franco before the outbreak. Caesar is a strong leader but hes still got a soft spot for the bygone human race so when a group of plague survivors stumbles upon the ape village he doesnt immediately scalp them. Led by engineer Malcolm (Jason Clarke) the small scouting party has traveled from blighted San Francisco (aka Baghdad by the Bay) to repair a hydroelectric dam that might power the city. But Caesar has developed the ability to speak and he bellows a one-word answer ""Go""When human leader Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) prepares the city for battle Caesar resists the war cries of beta-chimp Koba (Toby Kebbel) and agrees to let Malcolm fix the abandoned power plant if he leaves his weapons at home. But in one of the most wickedly funny scenes in sci-fi history Koba uses monkeyshines to bamboozle some gun-toting yahoos and scuttle the peace treaty. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" was released in the tumultuous year 1968 and the series has always had a civil-rights subtext that bordered on the too-obvious. But because the latest special effects convey the apes diverse personalities so well this is the most metaphorically and morally evolved film of the bunch. My old comrades at the academy could spend many moons debating whether ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a parable about the Native American genocide or a warning against plundering foreign energy resources (symbolized by a 76 gas station that the apes inhabit) but the thick layer of schmaltz in the third act ensures that the political punch turns to buttermilk. For most audiences a banana is just a banana and a richly imagined clash of ideas is a just a harmless game of cowboys and simians.What ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 210  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Grade A In ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" Caesar the super-chimp who started a rebellion and founded an ape state in Muir Woods becomes the most stirring political leader youll see anywhere on-screen today. He strives to organize apes of every kind into a just society. He turns a one-time circus orangutan into a teacher who tells his class that apes do not kill apes. He employs gorillas as his states perimeter guard. He tries to civilize a scarred Bonobo ape that lives only to fight. And when humans establish a foothold in an eerie shattered overgrown San Francisco Caesar doesnt move to wipe them out. He works for a two-state solution. The very existence of this subtle dynamic endlessly fascinating character pays tribute to the sophistication of ""performance-capture"" technology which digitally records actors movements and expressions then turns them into fantasies of say talking apes. Since the turn of the millennium actor Andy Serkis has brought dazzling artistry to this process whether as Gollum in Peter Jacksons Tolkien movies or in the title role in Jacksons ""King Kong."" Serkis outdoes himself as Caesar in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" This gigantic spellbinder of a movie rests on his ability to convey power and command with his posture and an array of emotions via his incredibly malleable face from kingly and fatherly concern to menace friendship love despair and stinging sadness. This performance-capture milestone should be recognized with the awards and acclaim that too often go to actors who put on fake noses or phony accents. In ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" Caesar never lost his vision of bringing simians together and creating a real home for them not even when they were fighting for their lives. At the end of ""Rise"" the apes appeared safe in the redwoods while humans started to come down with ""simian flu"" - caused by the retrovirus that was genetically engineered to cure Alzheimers but instead accelerated apes intelligence and killed people. In ""Dawn"" which takes place at least 10 years later the filmmakers visualize a state fit for a Caesar. This lush layered haven appears to have developed so organically that its hard to separate where natures plateaus and caves end and the apes own handiwork begins notably a marvelous whirling trellised ramp leading to Caesars lair. More important the movie tests Caesars ability to improvise while maintaining his moral balance. Soon after we see evidence of the apes thriving as a unit in a thrilling deer hunt humans stumble onto their turf. Theyre part of a remnant that has survived the simian flu and hopes to restart a hydroelectric dam that falls in the apes domain. The humans want to power up the city of San Francisco where hundreds of men and women - not quite the equivalent of Caesars roughly 2000 apes - have huddled together for strength and warmth. They aim to connect with other human enclaves and re-establish a demolished civilization. Caesar grudgingly grants the humans access to the dam and provides limited help. But its more difficult for him to teach his apes about peaceful coexistence than it was to unite them against mankind. The previous film peaked when Caesar used jungle instinct to establish his dominance at a primate center with apes and monkeys who acted the way they were treated - as dumb animals. Then he made them almost as smart as he was by spraying them with that brain-enhancing retrovirus. (The circus orangutan Maurice was his one near-peer.) Tragically in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" Caesar finds that promoting long-term strategies and ethical behavior is harder than spearheading a great leap forward for the apes. As humans and apes revert to atavistic reflexes the film becomes a timeless fable about the perils of tribalism for both species. Director Matt Reeves matches up ape and human forces with heartbreaking nail-biting evenness. Each side has a violent wild card the trigger-happy dam expert Carver (Kirk Acevedo) and the bellicose Bonobo ape Koba (Toby Kebbell). The co-founder of New San Francisco Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) helps set calamity in motion but hes not an evil man just a pragmatist at wits end. Caesars heroic counterpart is Malcolm (Jason Clarke) the open-minded bighearted leader of the mission to the dam. Malcolm a widower has a lover - a medic and former CDC employee Ellie (Keri Russell) - and a teenage boy Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) who retreats into his sketchbook and graphic novels because he cant accept Ellie as his stepmother. Caesar has a loving wife Cornelia (Judy Greer) who gives birth to an adorable baby boy and a proud confused adolescent son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston). Reeves makes the bonding of these characters credible by tying it to their individual needs and skills. You never catch the human characters overacting fear or wonder - theyre simply enthrallingly in the grip of it. Serkis and his troupe use the apes sign language yelps and yowls and rough-voiced verbal speech to hit operatic high notes and sometimes grace notes too. In a wonderful surprise Kebbells scarifying Koba gets to play moments of stunning black comedy (the film could have used more). And its extraordinarily moving to see Alexander dive into a graphic novel with Karin Konovals wise literate Maurice. The movie does suffer from an over-emphatic musical score. So its a balm to the ears when the Bands ""The Weight"" (""Take a load off Fanny"") wafts through the redwoods via the sounds system of a revived 76 gas station. Happily Reeves doesnt stint on dynamic ravishing visual harmonies not even in the middle of pitched battles. The apes attack on San Francisco is as potent as the siege sequence in ""Ivanhoe"" and the prolonged continuous shot of Koba gaining control of a runaway tank tracks a fiery parabola of destruction. Reeves and Serkis pour so much feeling into Caesars final close-ups that his melancholy gaze seems to follow you out of the theater.

PHOTOS Summer 2014 movie preview One of the most fantastic films of the season is a second sequel to a reboot of a franchise that dates back 46 years. More than just a pic featuring apes run amok the action-packed drama is front-loaded with gripping suspense and intelligence. It also delivers a first-rate fully committed performance -- from an actor (Andy Serkis) doing stop-motion work as an ape named Caesar. Chew on that while you read a primate primer Planet of the Apes (1968) The original classic featuring one of the most shocking twists in cinematic history. Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971) Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972) Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973) The not-so-memorable not-so-classics. PHOTOS Best and worst movie remakes Planet of the Apes (2001) The embarrassing Tim Burton-directed reboot flop. For proof Google ""Helena Bonham Carter"" and ""Ape costume."" Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011) The surprisingly deft installment starring James Franco as a scientist whose experimental drug treatments on his pet chimp Caesar eventually leads to an Ape uprising in San Francisco. This edition brings audiences up to speed in an effectively haunting opening montage. Several years have passed since the apes engaged in warfare on the Golden Gate Bridge and the ensuing ""simian flu"" has wiped out millions of humans. Caesar and his highly evolved highly intelligent tribe now live in the woods near the remnants of the City by the Bay. They dont rely on electricity or heat to live and eat or resort to violence to solve conflict. Humans? According to the apes they might be extinct and besides who needs em anyway. As sage Casear -- a new dad -- notes to Koba (Toby Kebbell) they destroyed themselves and deserve their fates. Very heavy thought-provoking stuff. This utopian society is rudely interrupted when a small group of surviving gun-toting humans (headed by Jason Clarke and Keri Russell) invade their habitat and seek their assistance. A broken-down dam is in the vicinity and if its repaired civilization could be restored. Pacifist Caesar wants to make it work if guns are disabled and thats a big if; livid revenge-seeking Koba wants to go rogue and kill. PHOTOS Keri and others on the red carpet Watching the apes take on the power struggle is a compelling marvel. All of them have individual characteristics making it simple to differentiate between them. They weigh the issues with each other in a unique sign language and have the ability to communicate with humans via erudite English. (Dont know how the special effects team pulled this off; dont want to know). Out of context and in the wrong hands these scenes could have been uncomfortably laughably absurd. Russell cooing over a baby ape because it reminds her of her deceased daughter? Gag. But this is an ace production enhanced by a high caliber of talent. Theres real turmoil behind Serkis eyes and when Koba amp; Co. turn on him the hurt is evident. Clarke a mesmerizing Australian actor who also worked with an ape in Zero Dark Thirty brings gravitas to the role as well. This is not a showdown of good versus evil. So sophisticated is the writing youll root for everyone. PHOTOS Celebs whove lost or gained weight for roles Then the drawn-out and inevitable carnage-filled spectacle kicks in. Why look its an army of apes Riding horseback into San Francisco And theyre carrying Uzis The action moves briskly yet the climax feels like a slight letdown only because the first half is so innovative. It doesnt matter if a CGI-enhanced damn dirty ape is blowing stuff up or a CGI-enhanced alien -- weve all been there done that many times already this summer. At least the climax practically guarantees another sequel. And this dystopian future never looked so good.

Richard Corliss July 10 2014 SHARE WETA/20th Century Fox Caesars palace the lord of the apes (Serkis) rules his forest realm The chimps get the best lines and the more potent motivations in this indie-vibe sequel to the irresistible Rise ""Prepare your families"" President Obama instructs a desperate nation. ""Know your evacuation route."" It is 10 years after the events of the 2011 hit Rise of the Planet of the Apes so for the Commander-in-Chief to remain in the White House he must have seized imperial power exactly as his most zealous detractors believed he would. And thats not the scariest forecast in the new sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. A ""simian flu"" created in a lab has killed most of the worlds Homo sapiens and weaponized chimpanzees with Mensa IQs run wild across the Earth. Its Ape-ocalypse Now. Rise directed by Rupert Wyatt and written by Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver was a wonderful surprise a parable of parenting in which benign San Francisco scientist Will Rodman (James Franco) raises the genetically enhanced infant chimp Caesar (the great Andy Serkis under all those motion-capture gizmonics) to maturity while researching a serum he hopes will cure his own fathers Alzheimers disease. Somehow something goes wrong and the humane ape foments a rebellion against the men who took him from Rodman and subjected him to beastly mistreatment. By the end of that terrific film Caesar had led his ape army across the Golden Gate Bridge toward a handful of sequels. (READ Corlisss review of Rise of the Planet of the Apes) Dawn of the Planet of the Apes while not nearly the masterpiece proclaimed by many critics is certainly a fascinating cross-species a big-budget summer action fantasy with a sylvan indie-film vibe and a war movie that dares ask its audience to root for the peacemakers. With Matt Reeves (Cloverfield Let Me In) taking over as director and screenwriter Mark Bomback (Live Free or Die Hard) joining Jaffa and Silver the new movie has politics on its mind just like its predecessor -- also like the 1963 Pierre Boulle novel and the original Charlton Heston film five years later. The difference is that this one meanders through the woods for much of its two-hour-plus running time. Only at the climax does it escalate into martial majesty. In the wake of the flu epidemic two tribes of foragers now occupy the Bay Area. Above in Muir Woods are the apes led by Caesar. Below in the wreck of downtown San Francisco a ragtag band of human survivors have no electricity and are running out of fuel. Neither group has contact with the other until a few humans seeking to restart a hydroelectric dam up in the forest encounter a hairier host of primates. Can the two species live in harmony? Reeves and the writers want you to hope so even as they must realize that any Paris Peace Accord of man and monkey would put the kibosh on a Noon of the Planet of the Apes. (WATCH The trailer for Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) Whereas Rise devoted an hour or so to the hopeful if ominous domesticity of its daddy-day-care plot the new movie begins by focusing on an ape Eden. The first dozen minutes -- after a brief recap of the flu outbreak and the Obama sound bite for a hurricane advisory turned into a warning of imminent Armageddon -- play like the oddest episode of PBSs Nature. Caesar leads his extended family in their daily routine riding horses to chase a herd of deer battling a grizzly bear and sharing such pacific lessons as ""Ape not kill ape."" (Theyve apparently learned to speak English from the star of another PBS show Sesame Streets Cookie Monster.) A former Che who wants to be Gandhi Caesar agrees to let the human visitors -- ex-architect Malcolm (Jason Clarke) his nurse friend Ellie (Keri Russell) and his teen son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee the boy in Let Me In) -- do their ""human work"" in rewiring the dam. Thats not cool by Caesars ape rival Koba (Toby Kebbell) once a victim of mans cruel experiments; he points to his scars and mutters ""Human work."" He plans an assault on mankind as Caesar and Malcolm join forces to prevent all-out war. If Caesar is the Roman emperor of Shakespeares play then the understandably vengeful Koba is Cassius a schemer with a mean and hungry look. As long as were spitballing literary allusions consider George Orwells Animal Farm which posited that pigs would overthrow their landowner and commence to squabbling murderously among themselves. In Dawn Caesar would be Old Major the boar who fuels the uprising (Marx or Lenin in Orwells parable) and Koba the strong-arm Napoleon (Stalin). The pigs initial rallying cry ""Four legs good two legs bad"" is later corrupted into ""Four legs good two legs better."" Koba thinks Caesar has betrayed the apes revolution by agreeing to collaborate with their natural enemy. And Caesar sees Koba as seduced by militarism. ""I always think ape better than human"" he tells Malcolm. ""I see now how like them we are."" (FIND Animal Farm on the all-TIME 100 Novels list) Reeves is smart to concentrate on the apes. Splendidly realized by actors transformed by visual effects supervisor Joe Letteri the simians are creatures of remarkable power and nuance. Serkis who brought Peter Jacksons Gollum and King Kong to pulsing life and who deservedly gets top billing in Dawn plays Caesar as a wise wizened leader stooped by the burden of wielding power judiciously. Kebbells Koba is provoked to operate by brute force because he suffered that in the cage Caesar freed him from. Other chimps undergo subtle or volcanic emotional shifts and you can detect every thought and feeling on the ""faces"" of Caesars son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) and Kobas son Ash (Doc Shaw). This is brilliant acting even if the actors arent visible. Indeed the movie invests so much more time and ingenuity on the apes than Rise did that you may wonder if further episodes in the series will dispense with humans altogether. Maybe they should because the humans here are mostly limited to rote bravado and fretting. They also lack character shading. Malcolm good; guy who smokes cigarettes and shoots a chimp bad. The human in charge down in Frisco (Gary Oldman) blusters a lot but cant match Koba for Patton-like intensity. The movie threatens to come down with a case of the drabs. At times the story of some Greenies trying to make a big social statement with a hydroelectric dam plays out like a big-budget gloss on Kelly Reichardts recent Night Moves with the same thesis of idealism curdled into terrorism. (READ Corlisss review of that dam indie film Night Moves) The viewers brain may be moved by Caesars statesmanlike sagacity but their guts want war. This is an adventure film not a Pacifica radio pledge drive. As one of the humans says of the apes ""Theyre talking animals With bad-ass spears"" Guns too. And when Koba takes command and storms the humans compound Dawn finally makes good on its promise of merging action with artistry. Watch and wonder at the tracking shot from a tank turret as apes seize the means of destruction from men. Listen too when Michael Giaccinos score which had gone indie-sensitive with pensive solo-piano noodling revs into full symphonic clamor and roar. No spoiler alert is needed here Dawn ends with a closeup of Caesar pondering his lot like Old Major from George Orwells Animal Farm. This ""Ape Forest"" is no less plangent in musing on both the origin of the species and its potentially awful end. Also when it gets going its a pretty fine movie.

Photo David James Twentieth Century Fox Dawn of the Planet of the Apes review Get along or go to war? 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Science fiction. Starring Jason Clarke Gary Oldman Keri Russell and Andy Serkis. Directed by Matt Reeves. (PG-13. 130 minutes.) ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is an attempt at a serious action movie but it doesnt quite satisfy. It has a few earnest ideas but they dont go deep enough to matter and theyre slightly in conflict anyway. And as an action movie its slow and predictable. The movies main virtue is in its visual design. In this future world (no more than a dozen years off) the woods of Marin County are filled with highly intelligent apes while a blighted downtown San Francisco shelters the human survivors of a deadly flu. Tunnels have been repurposed as shelters and you can see beat-up storefronts and fragments of street signs for Market Street near California. You dont have to live in the area to feel the sadness of these scenes - the echoes of a life no longer possible a modern paradise that wasnt appreciated until it was gone. A pre-credits sequence of old news footage shows how things got so bad. A simian flu hit the world and wiped out most of the Earths population. Apparently this happened sometime during Obamas second term which continues his run of hard luck and now there are pockets of humanity stranded in the various cities. Meanwhile a new class of ape is in the ascendant with genetically enhanced brains that give them the capacity for speech. More in Movies Code Black review Health care system on life support Last Sentence review Fairly compelling look at flawed man Venus in Fur review Brutally provocative battle of sexes Varied lineup on both sides ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" aims for a sophisticated point of view something that goes beyond the usual rooting interest. We are reacquainted with Caesar (Andy Serkis) from the previous installments. Hes the leader of the apes and a military strategist. In his stillness and sad-eyed reticence hes like an ape version of Ulysses S. Grant - clearly some kind of great man except he isnt a man. Unfortunately there are apes all around him that are stupid selfish and shortsighted. The human side has a similarly varied lineup. There are the nice researchers (Jason Clarke Keri Russell) who have the big picture the vision for how this future man-ape world might work. And then there are humans who just want to invade the apes while theyre still weak and wipe them out. Heres the problem Though everything about the movie seems to push toward some laid-back West Coast solution - where the people and the apes figure out a way to get along - and though everything that happens onscreen seems to move the audience toward desiring such a result the whole franchise depends on another kind of outcome. Conflicted viewing The movie is called ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" after all. This means that every ostensibly bad human who sees these apes as an existential threat is in fact correct and that every nice human who just wants to hold hands with them is wrong. This doesnt make for a complex viewing experience but for a conflicted one. The movie has a very simple story about the humans need for a hydroelectric plant which is in occupied ape territory. But the filmmakers milk it for every beat and nuance partly out of awareness that the movie must be stretched to feature length and partly out of a misguided sense of pace. Then again when a movie is inconclusive when its heading nowhere theres no telling what should be emphasized and what should be glossed over. Everything is of equal unimportance. If you see the movie notice how the ending is no ending and the fact that it even feels like one is entirely a function of Michael Giacchinos musical score. He brings in the horns then the strings; then the horns come in louder and the illusion is created that were experiencing some grand resolution. But back up for a second and it seems more like the writers have really dug themselves a hole for next time. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

That question is so outwardly simple open-ended and subjective that it doesnt get asked enough. Since it invites so many varied responses it should follow that movies made on a mass scale -- intended to be consumed by as many people as possible -- should deliver layered varied experiences. Of course that ideal has little to do with cold logistics of Hollywood moneymaking. Fortunately certain moviegoers know exactly what they want while others prefer to explore the vast ocean of possibilities available on theaters and digital platforms at any given moment. But millions of others dont even both to ponder their options. Unconsciously lured by million-dollar marketing campaigns they gravitate towards large scale new releases by virtue of the tunnel vision at their disposal ""This is the stupid movie you need to see right now"" theyre told; thus the ever-expanding ""Transformers"" grosses. But instead of exploiting yet another opportunity to bemoan a titanic achievement in blockbuster idiocy the time has come to celebrate the systems ability to do some good This weeks big release ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" provides a first-rate example of big budget escapism done right. Along with satisfying the needs of blase audiences eager for another fast-paced summer distraction replete with explosions and digital effects it applies those standards with far more artful results. It speaks to the masses with some treats for the discerning types in the back. More than simply the best of the ""Apes"" franchise since its first installment in 1968 Matt Reeves thrilling sequel to the brainy ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" uses the language of cinema in advanced ways that transcend its status as pop culture entertainment. Addressing multiple sensibilities at once it provides a keen response to the assumption that if ""Transformers"" makes money the only thing people want is more of the same. This ""Apes"" installment speaks to the sensibilities of many viewers at once and its strengths point to far greater possibilities than the movie itself. Reality Check Is ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" a masterpiece? Hardly. The movie derives much of its power from a thrilling pace maintained by director Matt Reeves (who managed to similarly refine familiar material with the enjoyable shakeup to found footage tropes in ""Cloverfield"" and the kid vampire drama ""Let Me In"" a slicker remake of the Swedish original). But Reeves direction essentially props up the extraordinary effects work that allows performance capture fixture Andy Serkis to put on a real performance as the simian lead Caesar now the strong-willed leader of a band of evolved apes 10 years after human civilizations fall. But the skeleton of a plot in which a struggling human outpost led by an icy Gary Oldman and expeditious Jason Clarke approach the apes in the hopes of gaining access to a hydroelectric generator near their den offers far less inspiration. As soon as Clarkes character gains Caesars reluctant trust and the humans begin their work under the apes cautious gaze its clear that the relationship will eventually topple into a downward spiral. Rival ape Koba (Toby Kebbell) -- whose name is a canny reference to a nickname for Joseph Stalin -- denounces the notion of permitting ""human work"" recalling his travails in the lab. Of course Koba comes up with a grim scheme to topple Caesars authority and strike back at the humans who response with their own vicious warmongering. The whole thing devolves into a chaotic showdown between man and ape right on schedule. But this is not a movie in which the surprises stem from its outcome. Monkey Stars ""Dawn"" makes up for its lack of subtleties with a sensational atmosphere that operates on a far more sophisticated plane. Whereas the previous entry took the form of a laboratory thriller this post-apocalyptic war epic is a first-rate example of a different tradition. Compared for instance to Darren Aronofskys jumbled ""Noah"" Reeves has constructed a fluid pop spectacle thats nonetheless dominated by morbid inevitabilities. By setting the action a decade into the future the director manages to construct a remarkable jungle setting defined by Caesars resolve and his post-human community -- replete with a cozy family life -- registers genuine emotion. In fact Caesars such a multidimensional character that the humans get the short end of the stick. Clarke makes a concerted effort to look frightened and empathetic on cue while Oldmans raspy approach is mechanical to a fault. But they arent the stars anyway Bookended by extraordinary closeups of Caesars face ""Dawn"" gives Serkis a bonafide performance thats like an organic special effect. Even James Camerons blue-faced ""Avatar"" creations didnt contain such facial nuances. Without turning the apes into blatant racial symbols their dark furry features suggest a blurry otherness that foregrounds their separation from their human foes. Theres a refreshing quality to the way ""Dawn"" downplays its familiar faces in favor of the technical wizardry used to invent new ones. Caesars valiant plight is complimented by a detailed world and speedy action loaded with advanced visual conceits from an energizing hunt that opens the story to an expressionistic showdown that includes one memorable long take involving an ape perched atop a tank. ""Dawn"" is a visual splendor in which the images enhance the power of its timeless themes. A Gateway Drug Swept up in the impressive CGI and plot one could easily discount the hints of radical storytelling that breach the narrative. The first 15 minutes of ""Dawn"" unfold with virtually no dialogue foregrounding the apes general reliance on sign language and expression to communicate even as the occasional word sneaks in. Its a near-experimental approach one that unquestionably calls up memories of the prologue to ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" which forces you to focus on the extraordinary images in every frame. While these sequences may have been costly to produce they actually bear a marked similarity to ""The Tribe"" Ukrainian director Myroslav Slaboshpytskiys Cannes-winning debut feature which opens later this year. Told exclusively through sign language Slaboshpytskiys extraordinary feature unfolds against the dreary backdrop of a private school filled with criminally-oriented teens. One of them new arrival Sergey (Grigory Fesenko) is drawn to a dangerous gang enjoys a sexually explicit affair with another student and eventually develops a dangerous resentment for his peers. His plight is all about minutiae trusting viewers to pay attention to each moment and various sectors of the frame to pick up on character details. The images tell the story allowing the medium to shine as only it can. Theres something primal about human communication reduced to its physical dimensions. So it follows that both movies present bleak visions of humanitys inevitable decline into violent extremes. In ""Dawn"" the humans astonished reactions whenever they lock eyes with the apes convey more depth than any spoken words. Likewise ""The Tribe"" foregrounds the communicative power of people looking directly at each other and paying attention to their movements. Even as they gesticulate wildly they transcend linguistic boundaries. Whenever ""Dawn"" echoes this technique it points to a far smarter possibility for the Hollywood blockbuster as a gateway drug. Beyond the Planet of the Apes This kind of adventurous entertainment is especially valuable at a time when sensibilities need to evolve -- not unlike the rebellious apes at the center of this still-vibrant franchise -- to match an ever-cluttered marketplace. If you see one movie this weekend it should be ""Boyhood"" Richard Linklaters 12-years-in-the-making coming-of-age tale which has no precedent in film history. And theres finer post-apocalyptic escapism in Bong Joon-hos ""Snowpiercer"" which is playing around the country and arriving on VOD platforms this Friday. Jafar Panahis ""Closed Curtain"" is gradually opening nationwide and evokes a more personal form of the apocalypse by exploring the Iranian filmmakers life under house arrest banned from making movies. There are rich cinematic possibilities all around us. But for anyone reticent to look beyond the upper tier of mainstream possibilities ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a terrific place to start. Grade B+ ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" opens nationwide on Friday.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Michael OSullivan July 10 2014 If the CGI apes stole the show from their less lifelike human counterparts in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" the two groups are more evenly matched in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" The latest chapter in the rebooted sci-fi franchise charts the emergence of a culture of super-intelligent chimpanzees gorillas and orangutans and the simultaneous decline of the human race after it is nearly destroyed by a laboratory virus. In the process the movie presents us with two equally engaging and frustrating families one human and one ape. ""Family"" of course can refer to more than the nuclear unit of parents and children. Although there are two families at the center of this highly watchable post-apocalyptic popcorn flick -- the chimp leader Caesar with his ""wife"" and two sons on one side and a trio of human survivors on the other -- ""Dawn"" is also about the broader use of that term. Its the story of the struggle between the family of Man and the family of Ape. Its also the story of struggles within those two groups. As the film opens Caesar -- movingly played by Andy Serkis with a mix of motion-capture technology and digital animation -- is living peacefully in the woods outside San Francisco with his pregnant partner Cornelia (Judy Greer) and their adolescent son known as Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston). But an incursion by members of a colony of virus-resistant humans from the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge leads to tension not just between Man and his closest nonhuman cousin but between factions from each group that cant agree whether to trust or to attack their neighbors. It is no accident that the source of conflict here is energy in the form of an inactive hydroelectric plant just next door to the ape encampment. The humans claim a right to it in order to satisfy their addiction to power. Leading the human negotiating team is the pacifist Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and his son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) and partner (Keri Russell). Their job is made harder by the presence in their party of an anti-ape hothead (Kirk Acevedo) and by their colony leader (Gary Oldman) who would just as soon shoot first and ask permission to use the power plant later. Similarly Caesars decision to compromise with the humans -- a trait picked up from his human ""father"" in the last film (James Franco seen in a brief video clip) -- clashes with the ape Koba (Toby Kebbell). An embittered chimpanzee who still bears the scars from his years in a research laboratory Koba hates and mistrusts all humans as well as some more highly evolved members of his own kind. This sets up parallel struggles not just between species but within them. The films plentiful action is thrilling at times -- even if some of the ape-on-ape fight sequences dont fully register as real -- and the cinematography has a dark and dramatic intensity. More important the apes feelings are conveyed beautifully mainly through facial animation and sign language. Though only one or two of them actually speak they are remarkably expressive characters. Introduced in the last film Maurice the orangutan (Karin Konoval) is an audience favorite. Imprisoned at one point by Koba Maurice with his soulful eyes is especially good at eliciting our sympathy. Director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"") has clearly marshaled a lot of expertise from the field of primate behavior here not just in terms of the apes physical gestures and movement but in their emotions as well. ""Dawn"" may be a silly summer move but the apes in it are almost as believable as anything in a documentary about the work of primatologists Jane Goodall or Dian Fossey. Caesar particularly is as poignant as the protagonist of ""Project Nim"" the 2012 documentary about the sad life of a chimp who was taught sign language. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" works both as allegory and action-adventure film. The internecine conflict between apes mirrors the troubled history of our own race. It isnt just that Caesar is a better ape than Koba but that both of them tragically embody a dual nature that is all too recognizably human.    PG-13. At area theaters. Contains violence and brief crude language. 122 minutes. goingoutguide movies true Please provide a valid email address.

"Review Dawn of the Planet of the Apes - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Dawn of the Planet of the Apes  Video Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a solid follow up to Rise Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the latest motion capture epic ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" Chicago Tribune film critic Michael Phillips reviews the latest motion capture epic ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Three summers ago ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" proved its possible to reboot a franchise while avoiding that sinking feeling of movie capitalism at its dumbest.Now in a disappointing July dominated with a shrug by ""Transformers Age of Extinction"" the follow-up ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" has arrived. Just in time. The nations multiplexes need a solid hit to save face and lend the impression that alls right with the business preferences and practices in Hollywood. Whatever audiences think of it Id say the latest ""Apes"" picture is just that a solid success sharing many of its predecessors swift exciting storytelling and motion-capture technology virtues while going its own way in the ongoing tale of life on Earth after a human-made ""simian flu"" virus has wiped out most of the homo sapiens as well as the simian population. The director this time is Matt Reeves no stranger to fantasy; he made ""Cloverfield"" and the American remake of the vampire thriller ""Let the Right One In"" titled ""Let Me In."" The war between the ravaged species in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" has driven the surviving ape colony led by proud diplomatic Caesar (Andy Serkis) to the redwoods north of San Francisco. ""Ape not kill ape"" is the principle of this clan and the system works Theyre alive.But not alone. One day in the forest (the movie was shot mostly in British Columbia) the apes encounter a human survivor played by Jason Clarke on a recon mission to determine if a nearby dam can be restored to provide power to an increasingly desperate clutch of human city dwellers down in the Bay Area. Gary Oldman is their de facto leader eager to take back the planet by any means necessary. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" runs about 25 minutes longer than ""Rise."" The movie has trouble finding its rhythm in the third act and feels somewhat padded. Yet theres a lot going on in this film. As with the recent ""Godzilla"" theres an essential gravity to the mood here. And the human interest element is more present and persuasive in ""Dawn"" thanks to Clarke and his fellow Australian Kodi Smit-McPhee (of ""Let Me In"") who plays his troubled son and to reliable Keri Russell as Clarkes lover the kindest warmest human left on the planet and one of the reasons Caesar doesnt kill them all in the first 30 minutes of the movie.Serkis is the worlds preeminent motion-capture performer having lent his physicality and vocal flourishes to King Kong and ""Lord of The Rings"" Gollum prior to the soulful tormented Caesar of the ""Apes"" series. At this point in the motion-capture effects industry theres little question of believing what were seeing. We believe. We believe there is an actor a real actor in there behind the eyes of the digital creation. This is why the film despite its bloat and its overfondness for scenes of massacre feels as if it were made by actual humans.Two other things about this movie make it noteworthy. One is the musical score by composer Michael Giacchino the best in the business right now. The tension and the atmosphere he evokes with a surprising array of instruments (hes especially creative in the percussion and keyboard realm) enhance every aspect of the viewing experience. Its an old-school sound recalling elements of Jerry Goldsmith among others and its remarkably free of bombast.The other is the inescapable political element. I write this as a Chicagoan whose city has become an international symbol of gun violence bordering on insanity. In ""Dawn"" Caesars ape colony has no use for firearms; only when Koba (Toby Kebbell) the vicious ambitious rival ape gets hold of humankinds weapons does the utopian community turn against itself. The movies pretty grim. Then again the whole ""Planet of the Apes"" mythology depends on a vision of the future that speaks very very poorly of humankinds ability to trust and adapt and play well with others. Following the ""Dawn"" screening I ducked into ""Transformers 4"" just long enough to see Mark Wahlberg exclaim in awe ""Weapons"" when a glorious cache of mass-destruction implements are revealed. The ""Apes"" saga is different -- sadder and wiser. The latest film is no less a commodity than those manufactured by Michael Bay but it doesnt treat the audience like a bunch of gorillas.mjphillipstribune.com""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" - 3 starsMPAA rating PG-13 (for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and brief strong language)Running time 210Opens Thursday evening Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Reviews Let Me In (movie) Michael Bay Matt Reeves Cloverfield (movie) Mark Wahlberg Dawn of the Planet of the Apes For Planet of the Apes  Matt Reeves several boyhood connections Latest movie reviews Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising72deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-dawn-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-20140709,0,6103929.column",200,dawnoftheplanetoftheapes34,dawnoftheplanetoftheapes,chicagotribune

Photo AP MOVIE REVIEW Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Running time 130 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence profanity). At the Lincoln Square the E-Walk the Kips Bay others. That the movie isnt called ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes and Humans Learning to Appreciate One Anothers Quirks"" seems to be a giveaway and yet this one is all about balance -- between destruction and rebuilding murder and birth mistrust and allegiance. For two hours of breathless drama you forget youre watching actors grunting like chimps and hope two rival civilizations can work together. The eighth ""Planet of the Apes"" movie is easily the best suspenseful and scary and cured of the silliness that infused all previous iterations even the 1968 original -- a fun kids movie oddly anointed a classic when those kids grew up while retaining their childish tastes. Years after a virus unleashed in 2011s far inferior ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" has killed off much of humankind and created a race of superintelligent apes living in a forest near San Francisco the animals spot a group of humans for the first time in 10 years. The people (led by Jason Clarke Keri Russell Gary Oldman and Kirk Acevedo) are hoping to gain access to a dam in the woods and supply power to a few hundred survivors in the city which will otherwise soon run out of fuel. The leader of the apes Caesar (played with wonderful subtlety by Andy Serkis merging beautifully with digital costumes) doesnt trust humans but he works with them to a degree found unacceptable by his chief lieutenant Koba (played terrifyingly by Toby Kebbell). To Koba who was tortured in the lab from which he and Caesar escaped in ""Rise"" it would be best to make war on the humans before the humans launch a conflict. The angry ape has a legitimate grievance which makes him one of the years most compelling movie villains but his cruelty makes you remember that Koba was one of Stalins nicknames. Instead of pushing any particular real-world analogy about groups of people mistrusting one another or humanitys selfish war on nature the movie smartly borrows a trick from many a great sci-fi film Its vague. You could read it as a parable about the dangers of guns or of being caught off-guard. Nobody delivers a hack line meant to take out some easy political target. Instead theres a classic Oldman roar -- ""Theyre animals"" -- that also reminds us that dismissing your enemy in such terms is rarely wise. A wave-the-bloody-shirt scene has many echoes in history while a spasm of sudden decisive violence is a shivery reflection of how dictatorships are born always accompanied by the rounding up of political prisoners. These haunting tableaux are staged with fierce concentration by director Matt Reeves who cut his teeth on the sophomoric ""Cloverfield"" before showing real maturity with ""Let Me In."" ""Dawn"" doesnt have a major action scene until the second hour but it goes by quickly anyway. Reeves adroitly toggles between foreboding and optimism while potential conflicts and allegiances range in all configurations of apes and humans. One instant theres a disarming sign of better things when a creaky machine starts playing an old song or a baby ape scampers comfortably among the humans. But then there will be a battle scene thats all hallucinatory lighting and the queasy dire tones of Michael Giacchinos unsettling score. If the human characters are somewhat thin (each of them is practically stamped with a halo or a devils horns) the apes make up for it by being riveting. Caesar -- noble wise thoughtful tender -- emerges as a blockbuster hero for the ages. If only the average superhero movie had so much humanity.

With the exception of the latest additions to the Star Trek and X-Men series both of which use time travel to conveniently break ties with canon these feature-length flashbacks travel in only one direction taking audiences on a scenic trip to someplace theyve already been. Dawn Of The Planet Of Apes the weeks big blockbuster release is technically a sequel to a reboot picking up at least a decade after the events of 2011s origin (of species) story Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes. Theres no guarantee in other words that the relaunched Apes saga will eventually arrive upon a Charlton Heston type damning his ancestors for blowing it all up. But the endgame is still right there in the title The planet viewers have been promised will one day belong to the apes. The only real question is how many more preludes the producers can squeeze out of the pre-Dr. Zaius years.As directed by Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) Dawn turns out to be a broody and reasonably entertaining act of brand extension marred mainly by its limited license to do anything but inch audiences a little closer to the inevitable ape-slavement. In the aftermath of a global ""simian flu"" introduced at the end of Rise mankind teeters on the edge of extinction its survivors huddling together in depowered metropolitan areas--including San Francisco where Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) gives pep talks to the increasingly demoralized masses. One day a scouting group led by token reasonable human Malcolm (Jason Clarke) stumbles upon the woodland encampment of Caesar (Andy Serkis) the chimpanzee whose IQ was chemically increased in the last installment. Post-escape hes become a proud father and a revered leader building a fully functioning society for his fellow brainy primates. But will the reappearance of Homo sapiens long thought dead and gone threaten their ape-topia?Dawn is never more compelling than when focusing on the inner workings of the thriving simian community. The films first act is largely wordless commencing with a group-hunt action scene and dispensing with all but a few lines of subtitled sign-language dialogue. (One is reminded of the best moments from Rise the ones set within the ape prison and also of the great prologue to 2001 A Space Odyssey.) Even more so than before Apes feeds off the talents of its star The undisputed king of motion-capture performance Serkis makes this older wiser Caesar both physically and emotionally convincing. A scene of him watching footage of his old ""master"" (James Franco whose character evidently died in the plague and who is not missed here) is a triumph of collaboration the CGI animators capturing the small waves of sadness and affection dancing across Serkis digitally scanned face.Yet for all the heart and soul the actor pours into his role watching Dawn still feels a bit like seeing massive expensive wheels spin in place. The film is built on a simplistic cant-we-all-get-along dichotomy drawing easy parallels between Caesar and Malcolm two fathers trying to forge an interspecies peace. Both sides have war hawks threatening the cease fire While the trigger-happy Carver (Kirk Acevedo) draws first blood former lab chimp Koba (Toby Kebbell) stews with hatred for his ex-oppressors. Meanwhile Malcolms teen son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) breaks down barriers by reading to the resident orangutan (Karin Konoval). Strangely the book they bond over is Charles Burns graphic novel Black Hole--a choice of little apparent thematic significance though viewers should probably be grateful that Reeves didnt go in the opposite direction and cut to a close-up of Animal Farm. (The chief ape commandment ""Ape Not Kill Ape"" provides enough Orwellian foreshadowing.) This being a summer blockbuster there are also scenes of ferocious man-on-chimp combat all lacking in stylistic personality. (In one of the only distinctive visual choices Reeves fixes the camera to the roof of a tank vaguely echoing the celebrated POV car-crash scene from his Let Me In.) And the 3-D is completely superfluous neglecting even to immerse the viewer in the dense foliage of the forest scenes or the impressively vegetated architecture of the city scenes. None of this would matter of course if the central drama worked liked gangbusters. But its hard to invest in a conflict with a predetermined resolution; theres just no suspense in a franchise whose history is already written. Dawn plays coy about the possibility of peace even as its existence is predicated on war being a foregone conclusion. Its not called Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes And Humans Who Peacefully Coexist.

An overloaded simian sequel boasts terrific effects and the great Andy Serkis as its ape hero. But is that enough? Andrew OHehir Follow Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Action movies Andy Serkis Apocalypse Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Dystopia Jason Clarke keri russell Matt Reeves motion capture Movies Rise of the Planet of the Apes Science Fiction and Fantasy Summer movies Entertainment News So heres where Hollywood and its boosters have placed their bets on redeeming what already feels like a disastrous summer season for the studios A handsome and atmospheric middle-chapter action movie thats been pumped up to a level of pseudo-Wagnerian boringness and loaded down with way too much significance. Also too much yelling. Everybody is yelling all the time in this damn movie and amid the impressive gloom of an abandoned San Francisco and the ape-infested Northern California redwoods that gets old really fast. Gary Oldman always an excellent actor plays one of the principal human characters and you get the sense they only had him on set for three days or something and told him to yell. So his lines and for that matter most of the human characters lines are delivered in capital letters Internet-screed style WTF DID YOU SEE THAT TALKING APES CAN U BELIEVE THAT SHT LETS BLOW THEM UP.One of the things that has apparently happened in the ape-pocalyptic future of director Matt Reeves prequel-reboot-sequel ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is that while other simian species have gotten smarter human beings have gotten a whole lot dumber. Maybe that accounts for the yelling or the poor Homo-sapiens decision making that leads to a military confrontation between the Edenic ape-society in Muir Woods and the hunkered-down humans of San Francisco who have survived a deadly flu epidemic. Lets hide our arms cache in a location that will be really easy for the apes to reach if they get pissed at us Lets send a heavily armed anti-ape hothead who seems to have been reared on transcripts of pre-apocalypse Sean Hannity broadcasts to negotiate with them As played by TV veteran Kirk Acevedo this marked-for-obvious-death character is the one guy in the movie who yells more than Oldman. Everything out of his mouth is basically ""Not to be a racist asshole or anything but ...""This is the paragraph where I play my role as a cog in the publicity machine and tell you that ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" which follows the unexpected 2011 summer hit ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (and lets face it thats confusing Doesnt dawn come before sunrise?) is a sort of pretty good choice as far as your summer entertainment dollar is concerned. You know on the whole Considering what they had to work with and so on. Reeves the creator of ""Felicity"" and the director of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Let Me In"" takes over for ""Rise"" director Rupert Wyatt and the level of CGI effects suggests a much larger budget which is always a double-edged sword. While the human cast is entirely new and uniformly dull Andy Serkis is undeniably terrific in the motion-capture role of Caesar the super-chimp nurtured by James Franco in the first movie. While a genetically engineered superbug has winnowed down the human population to almost nothing Caesar has been building a hippy-dippy ape commune in the woods of Marin County. (To anyone from the Bay Area this will be a weirdly irresistible idea although the locations used are actually in British Columbia.)Caesars troop live in wooden huts are learning to read and write after a fashion and as we saw in the first movie are developing the power of vocal speech. (This is believed to be physiologically impossible for chimpanzees according to actual science but never mind.) Their resemblance to idealized Native Americans or to the blue people of ""Avatar"" is rather too obvious to be overlooked. Screenwriters Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback have cooked up (or overcooked) a parable of innocence and experience that gestures at a whole bunch of real-world issues from the history of warfare and the rise of extremism to the conflict between tribalism and cosmopolitanism. Caesars ideological opponent in the war for simian hearts and minds is a brutal and duplicitous chimp called Koba (Toby Kebbell) who bears the scars of his abusive treatment in the labs of human science. Koba as you history majors may know was the youthful nickname and revolutionary nom de guerre of an especially notorious world leader and I bet the writers were really proud of that one. You Might Also Like But beyond the litany of exhausting historical references - which go from Wahhabism and al-Qaida to the Battle of Agincourt to the fact that Koba starts a fire in Ape-Paradise blames it on the humans and tries to assassinate Caesar - ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is mostly a western. To be specific its one of those westerns where the audience which already knows which side will win between the cowboys and Indians wistfully roots for the noble-savage underdogs who live in harmony with nature possess shamanic wisdom that can never quite be expressed and speak in a combination of subtitles and pidgin English. ""Ape not kill ape"" is the key commandment of Caesars society which at first is said sincerely and later (of course) ironically. Were one short metaphorical step away from ""White man bring firewater heap bad medicine"" in this movie - and there actually is a scene in which a chimp swigs from a whiskey bottle and then shoots someone.Caesar and human engineer Malcolm (Jason Clarke) gradually learn to trust each other and hope to forge a trans-simian peace treaty that will allow the San Francisco human colony to generate power using a dam deep in the ape-forest that might still work. (Theres a lot of feeble plotting herein but thats some of the worst.) Koba and Oldmans batshit-crazy yeller of course prefer to launch World War Ape and you get exactly one guess - no wait you dont. Not even one. Reeves is a highly capable filmmaker when it comes to managing the lugubrious rain-sodden mood and building tension toward the inevitable explosion of violence. The elaborate digital-effects action sequences are impressive although nothing we havent seen before and once your eyes get used to the artificial feeling of the motion-capture characters Caesar and Koba and Maurice the orangutan wise-man and the rest of the apes start to feel like well people. But the problem with ""Dawn of the Rise of the Hitler of the Stalin of the Apes"" is that Reeves and Serkis and a bunch of other entertainment professionals are stuck with an overly grandiose franchise that cant quite carry the weight thats been piled on it. (Is this prequel series universe-contiguous with the five great-dreadful movies of the 1968-73 Charlton Heston series? Thats a matter of debate although not interesting debate.) There were many moments where I admired this movie for its craftsmanship but virtually none where I was swept away by its storytelling and couldnt wait to find out what would happen. Heres a rule that has gradually become clear to me Any film that begins with one of those fake-news montages where snippets of genuine CNN footage are stitched together to concoct a feeling of semi-urgency around its hackneyed apocalypse already sucks even before it gets started. This one makes a dutiful attempt to struggle back from that suckage but it all ends in yelling. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

(WETA) B+ Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Genre Action/Adventure; Starring Jason Clarke Gary Oldman Keri Russell Andy Serkis; Director Matt Reeves; Release Date Wide 07/11/2014; Runtime (in minutes) 130; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor 20th Century Fox Film Corporation Posted July 17 2014 -- 1200 AM EDT Theres a good chance you never knew you needed to witness the sight of an angry ape charging on horseback double-fisting a pair of machine guns. But trust me you do. Although Jane Goodall might disagree that showstopping sequence of lead-spraying primate mayhem is just one of the many giddy pleasures in Matt Reeves surprisingly rollicking and resonant Dawn of the Planet of the Apes -- a sequel that easily tops its 2011 predecessor. Picking up 10 incident-stuffed years after the James Franco-led first film left off Dawn sets the stage as most postapocalyptic movies do nowadays with a helter-skelter montage of dire news reports informing us that humanity has been nearly decimated by a virulent strain of simian flu and that cities such as San Francisco where the film is set have been reduced to overgrown piles of rubble and ruin. But while Earths human population isnt doing so hot the apes are thriving. Caesar the cute chimp raised by Franco in the franchise opener is now the wise and benevolent leader of his species. He and his gang all live in Muir Woods just north of the city where theyve not only learned to read write and speak (English naturally) theyve also nurtured a healthy distrust of humankind -- which is probably smart considering that the humans have crowned a Caesar of their own (actually more like a Nero) in Gary Oldmans Dreyfus a tin-badge fascist whose mantra seems to be The only good ape is a dead ape. Needing electricity to power their shantytown Oldman dispatches a group of outdoorsy human ambassadors (including the chimp-athetic Jason Clarke and Keri Russell) to strike a deal with Caesar to let them repair a hydroelectric dam on ape turf. Wariness on both sides leads to betrayal and war and the movies off to the Uzi-toting-ape-on-horseback races. Reeves whose previous films Cloverfield and Let Me In were stronger on promise than payoff stages these battles with amazing technical skill and a real painters eye. His images as undeniably silly as they are are so striking they stick with you -- especially a beaut in which a ticked-off ape mans the rat-a-tat turret of a tank. If only as much care were put into the films human characters. Oldman nearly pops a hernia from hamming it up so hard and Clarkes melancholy eyes are so perpetually moist in his admiration of the apes you want to offer a tissue. The one truly great performance belongs to Andy Serkis whose Caesar is his most soulful motion-capture creation yet. Despite all the obscuring layers of digital trickery the actor manages to convey an impressive physicality and array of emotions from hope to grief to rage. I wont spoil which side wins the interspecies showdown but when it comes to who does the better acting the apes carry the day (hairy) hands down.

Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1033 a.m. MST July 9 2014Director Matt Reeves takes the story to darkly satisfying places as tensions mount between apes and humans in a desperately dystopian world (at least for the humans).Andy Serkis as Caesar in a scene from the film ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.""(Photo Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation)Story HighlightsCritics review 4 starsThe structure sets up parallels between the humans and apes but the apes are always more complex.Reeves takes the story in a dark direction but its satisfying.""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a dark film daringly so a sequel to a reboot that makes a solid franchise stronger.You can debate whether it is as good as 2011s surprisingly satisfying ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" which upped the intelligence ante of the original franchise.But there is no question that director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"" ""Let the Right One In"") took a chance with this film creating a desperate dystopian society (for the humans at least) in which survival of the species (again human) is very much in question. It will depend on our better nature and that like every other resource is running in short supply.HOTLIST Top 10 movies with monkeys King Kong and moreRELATED Guide to the apes of Dawn of the Planet of the ApesRELATED Movement pro transforms actors into apes for DawnThe apes living in the forest are faring much better. We see this from the start an exciting sequence in which Caesar (Andy Serkis back from the first film) now the leader of an organized society of apes directs a hunting expedition that goes slightly awry.Its been 10 years since the first film ended. The simian virus introduced at the end of that movie has wiped out the bulk of the human population; Caesar in fact hasnt seen a human in two years. His friend and lieutenant Koba (Toby Kebbell) isnt complaining. Koba bears the scars -- physical and otherwise -- of the lab testing and torture he endured in the first movie.Koba thinks Caesar who was raised by humans is too forgiving of them.On the human side of the equation survivors are living in the haunting ruins of San Francisco led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) bitter toward the apes having lost his family to the virus and Malcolm (Jason Clarke) much more compassionate despite suffering his own losses.A dam in the forest outside San Francisco might be the salvation for the humans who have about two weeks of fuel left. But the area is occupied by the apes. Dreyfus is wary of negotiating with them but Malcolm wants to give it a try. He takes a small group including his girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) to try to strike a deal with Caesar to let the humans have access to the dam.But just as Koba mistrusts all humans on principle so too does Carver (Kirk Acevedo) a trigger-happy cardboard bad guy mistrust all apes. Carver however is far less complex. This is true of the whole film. Reeves and the screenwriters set up a parallel structure -- even Caesar notes similarities. But in every case the apes are more fully developed than their human counterparts.Luckily thanks to outstanding special effects this works just fine. Serkis is even more expressive this time around. Caesar likes the life he has helped build -- he refers to the community as family -- but he still thinks about humans from time to time. He is after all the only one of his kind who has lived among them. Koba Caesar tells his son Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) has learned only hate from humans. Caesar has seen a more complete picture.Credit Reeves though for striking a balance between hope and hostility. One could argue that the end of the film is a set-up for another installment (and it is) but it is also an honest assessment of where things stand between apes and humans. Eschewing a tidy wrap-up Reeves doesnt leave us feeling manipulated as so often happens in films like this.Instead we want to know where the story goes from here and thats no small accomplishment.Review Dawn of the Planet of the Apes 4 starsDirector Matt Reeves.Cast Andy Serkis Jason Clarke Gary Oldman.

"Review Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a near-classic - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Dawn of the Planet of the Apes a near-classicBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 07/09/2014 120000 PM PDTUpdated 07/09/2014 063056 PM PDT Related StoriesJul 9Apes shows remarkable technical achievementsDawn of the Planet of Apes 10 more films where San Francisco takes it on the chinAll hail Andy Serkis.While one can marvel at so many things in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" Serkis -- who plays Caesar the human-sympathizing laboratory-enhanced leader of a tribe of apes inhabiting Muir Woods just north of the Golden Gate Bridge -- creates one of the most human characters seen in any 2014 film.The outstanding sequel to ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" continues to assert that this isnt your parents -- or your grandparents -- version of the classic story of apes and humans flipping places on the evolutionary ladder. ""Rise"" announced in 2011 that this was a film reboot to be taken seriously -- which was saying something considering what a mess Mark Wahlbergs 2001 reboot of the original 1960s film franchise was. And ""Dawn"" is even better boldly advancing the concept the way a sequel should while upping the ante on the visual effects.Of course the moviegoer must suspend disbelief at the sight of apes talking firing machine guns (which is really cool by the way) riding horses and generally acting like us. But thats easy because other aspects of the film are so believable which brings us back to Serkis dazzling performance as an animal thats as deep nuanced and conflicted as any human character you can imagine.In other words after seeing this movie some researchers may rethink using primates in experiments.Director Matt Reeves takes his time getting to the action that everyone knows is coming and with good reason. He carefully warms the audience up to the idea that the simian virus that escaped a San Francisco lab a decade earlier is offering the Earth an alternative nonhuman path to civilization by wiping out most humans. Only pockets of people remain including a group holed up in post-apocalyptic San Francisco led by the practical but determined Dreyfus (Gary Oldman).Advertisement Meanwhile in the forests of Marin County the primates that escaped the lab in the last film have built a society with Caesar as their leader. They hunt they fish they make fire and develop weapons and theyre multiplying. Led by the cautiously optimistic Malcolm (Jason Clarke) a small team of humans crosses the Golden Gate Bridge to repair a broken dam as a power source. They run into some of Caesars troops setting up the films most immediate conflict Cant we all just get along?Serkis makes Caesar into a classically sympathetic torn-between-worlds character. His range of emotions and need to believe in species coexistence is palatable. Toby Kebbell is just as powerful as Koba the scarred former lab ape and Caesars right-hand primate and eventual rival (right -- I am talking up the performance of men playing computer-animated apes in a movie starring Gary Oldman). While Caesar struggles with loyalties and with making the big decisions Koba shows the flip side -- arguably the more human side -- of the evolving apes with his bloodthirsty ambitions (he also provides the films only bits of humor while outsmarting a couple of useless humans). This photo released by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation shows Andy Serkis as Caesar in a scene from the film ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes."" (AP Photo/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation) Reeves and writers Rick Jaffa Amanda Silver and Mark Bomback strike an admirable balancing act in identifying heroes and villains. Which is to say you have good guys and bad guys on both sides. The audience isnt meant to root for apes vs. humans as much as for certain characters. Its one of the films best qualities. Of course a few questions remain unanswered. Whats happening to the rest of the Earth? How did the apes become so advanced so fast? How does Caesar work a camcorder when I still cant even figure out how to plug mine in? But these are minor distractions in a film thats gripping from the start.The climax is more than big enough for such an epic film and couldve been pulled from a ""Star Wars"" film -- if only apes could use lightsabers. And the way these primates are evolving that may happen in the next chapter which is already planned for a 2016 release. And why not? With characters this rich and an epic evolutionary clash progressing this franchise is back in full swing.Contact Tony Hicks at Facebook.com/BayAreaNewsGroup.TonyHicks or Twitter.com/insertfoot.Dawn of the Planet of the Apes    1/2Rating PG-13 (intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action brief strong language)Cast Andy Serkis Gary Oldman Jason Clarke Keri Russell Toby KebbellDirector Matt ReevesRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesOnline extraGo to www.mercurynews.com/entertainment to see a slideshow of photos from this film as well as a trailer.S.F. takes a few movie hitsThe reboots of ""Godzilla"" and ""Planet of the Apes"" make San Francisco look like the new Tokyo or New York ... in terms of being destroyed on film.

"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a visual feast - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a visual feast Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Movie review by Kenneth Turan Kenneth Turan reviews Dawn of the Planet of the Apes starring Andy Serkis Jason Clarke Gary Oldman and Keri Russell. Kenneth Turan reviews Dawn of the Planet of the Apes starring Andy Serkis Jason Clarke Gary Oldman and Keri Russell. Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Dawn of the Planet of the Apes review Filmmakers have not quite matched the elan of the previous film. If you want apes youve come to the right place. If people are your passion not so much.That in a nutshell is the verdict on ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" the sequel to 2011s ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" the splendid rebooting of the saga of species in conflict that has been a pop-culture staple for nearly 50 years. ------------FOR THE RECORD ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" In a review of the film ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" in the July 10 Calendar section actress Keri Russells first name was misspelled as Kerri. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes video No villains allowed Mark Olsen Mark Olsen ------------With Andy Serkis in top form as Caesar the he-who-must-be-obeyed ayatollah of apedom and Joe Letteri (a four-time Oscar-winner) and Dan Lemmon returning as well as visual-effects wizards ""Dawns"" vision of masses of intelligent apes swarming the screen as masters of all they survey is even more impressive than it was the last time around and reason enough to see the film all by itself.But when it comes to telling the story of the ragtag bunch of humans who inevitably clash with the upwardly mobile apes director Matt Reeves and screenwriters Rick Jaffa amp; Amanda Silver and Mark Bombach have not quite matched the elan of the previous film. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes trailer Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Searching for Cesar. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Searching for Cesar. See more videos For one thing likely envisioned as a bridge episode between the series starter and the next chapters cataclysmic showdown ""Dawns"" story lacks the urgency and interest Jaffa amp; Silvers script created the first time around.Tepid lines like ""Try not to speak you need to rest"" and the inevitable ""I thought we had a chance"" do not help matters and neither does the lack of a human leading man with the energy of ""Rises"" James Franco or the charisma to match Serkis Caesar.After a brief recap showing how the deadly simian flu all but wiped out humanity ""Dawn"" starts as well it might inside Caesars domain 10 years after the apes mass flight to Muir Woods across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco that was one of the last films visual highlights.Still mentored by ironic orangutan Maurice (Karin Konoval) and backed up by savage bonobo Koba (Toby Kebbell) Caesar is now a family man with an adolescent son named Blue Eyes (Nick Thurston) to guide to maturity.Given that Caesars followers have grown in number from 50 to 2000 the ability of motion-capture technology to bring this larger universe to life is critical and the technicians at Weta Digital have been up to the task.The apes are played by an increasing number of actors (or parkour performers inside motion-capture suits) which helps with verisimilitude especially when apes on horseback make an imposing appearance. Also new is the ability to shoot a huge chunk of the film not only in 3-D but in outdoor locations in Vancouver Canada; and New Orleans.One of ""Dawns"" most impressive set pieces occurs early on when an ape hunting party takes off against a herd of elk and also comes face to face with an exceptionally unhappy bear resulting in some highly adrenalized fang-and-claw nature footage.Then as they must a few puny humans appear. Lead by Malcolm (""Zero Dark Thirtys"" Jason Clarke) and compassionate nurse Ellie (Kerri Russell) they have been sent by their fellow survivors in a ruined San Francisco (finely created by production designer James Chinlund and his team) to find and repair a nearby hydroelectric dam whose energy is essential if the city is to survive.Naturally they are shocked to come across these obviously intelligent apes who even speak rudimentary English. When they report as much to Dreyfus the citys leader (an underutilized Gary Oldman) his paranoia is aroused and he fears for the worst.Koba -- not for nothing named after Joseph Stalin -- is as mistrustful of humans as Dreyfus is of apes which is not a good combination. As R. Crumbs philosophical Mr. Natural used to say ""Twas Ever Thus.""With its give-peace-a-chance plea for interspecies amity and its condemnation of needless mistrust not to mention preemptive strikes ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" places itself squarely on the side of the angels but in the process risks being more earnest than is good for it.Which is why the film is so fortunate to have Serkis whose work here and as Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Hobbit"" films turns motion capture into an art form all by himself. He and his fellow mo-cap actors truly make us believe we are watching intelligent apes in action and that is not something you see every day.kenneth.turanlatimes.com------------Dawn of the Planet of the ApesMPAA rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hours 10 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Column Reviews Renewable Energy Hydroelectricity Jason Clarke Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes motion-capture into real world Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Godfather inspires Serkis Caesar Dawn of the Planet of the Apes director Matt Reeves set for third film Dawn of the Planet of the Apes video Apes riding horses and more Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-planet-of-the-apes-review-20140710-column.html,200,dawnoftheplanetoftheapes41,dawnoftheplanetoftheapes,latimes

Entertainment ""Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes"" Will Have You Cheering For The Fall Of Humanity Why the riveting latest installment in the Apes franchise shifts its focus to the primate side of the story. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Caesar in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ID 3312550 While motion capture king Andy Serkis gets top billing when the credits roll at the end of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes you never see his flesh-and-blood face on screen. But man does he deserve it. As the performance behind Caesar the leader of the band of brainy primates poised to take over the Earth Serkis along with a team of visual effects artists has created a riveting character who is somewhere between human and animal and who is shockingly convincing. Caesar may be a mostly computerized creation but he has a soul. Caesar whose origins as a Gen-Sys scientists test subject turned surrogate child were chronicled in Rise of the Planet of the Apes is middle-aged and a parent in this installment dealing with overseeing a simian community in a world in which humanity is dying out. Hes got a lot to deal with including a resentful son (performed by Nick Thurston) and telegraphs to the audience a universe of complex emotions mostly without the use of dialogue. He never once comes across like a computer puppet channeling the movements of an actor wearing a mocap body sock. He feels solid and real a conflicted idealist trying to construct an ape Eden out in Muir Woods. Weve come a long way from the latex prosthetics (cutting edge at the time) that were used in the original Planet of the Apes. Nifty technology and sharp smart writing in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes which opens nationwide on July 11 make it easy to surrender to the idea of a primate population eclipsing the straggling remnants of mankind most of which was wiped out by the same manufactured virus that boosted the intelligence of the apes. Its enhanced chimps gorillas bonobos and orangutans arent humans playing at being animals -- they are animals and theyre not all that sure that humans are what they want to emulate. ID 3312095 David James/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ID 3313277 The film has a perfectly competent human cast including Jason Clarke Keri Russell and Kodi Smit-McPhee as a ragtag end-of-the-world family and Gary Oldman as the leader of the survivor colony holed up in the ruins of San Francisco but its the apes whom the story starts and stays with for a surprising amount of time and its their struggle for the future thats at its heart. The apes have been inventing a civilization for themselves while the people have been fighting to hold on to what remains of theirs as resources run out. In other words humanity can suck it -- this is a movie about monkeys. Well monkeys and metaphors. In taking over the rebooted Apes franchise and picking up 10 years after the events of Rise of the Planet of the Apes Let Me In director Matt Reeves has made a gripping sci-fi drama thats also a handy all-purpose allegory. Its depictions of the cautious forays toward alliances and conflict between the humans and the apes are compelling by themselves but also throw up all sorts of other resonances. Pick your poison Is it about race a fraught discussion since the first Apes movie in 1968? Theres a scene in which the mistrustful Koba (performed by an excellent Toby Kebbell) fools two suspicious humans into thinking hes harmless by putting on the act of an eager-to-please cartwheeling pet. He clowns and capers his way behind their defenses. Its a provocative moment that reads like a primate equivalent to Stepin Fetchit-style playing into racist caricatures Kobas empty expression replaced by a sneer as he turns away. ID 3312464 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ID 3313489 Is it about gun control? Dawn of the Planet of the Apes quietly presents a case that the weapons make peace impossible with the apes living in gun-free stability until a human search party reintroduces them into their world. Guns arent the cause of the violence roiling underneath most of the film but theyre the embodiment of the promise of violence and the movies a rebuke to the idea that there can ever be trust when one or both sides of a conflict are packing implements intended to make it as simple as possible to kill things. Guns make it all too easy for someone to fire the first volley in a war thats impossible to finish and guns mean that war can take place on a larger scale than either side really wants. Theyre fuel to the fear and anger both humans and apes are harboring. Is it about the Middle East? OK probably not but theres an undeniable twinge to the films rueful understanding that some people/apes will never be able to get over old wounds. Caesar on one side and Jason Clarkes Malcolm on the other know that peace means accepting vulnerability and being able to forgive sometimes terrible slights but not everyone agrees with them. There are human and primate characters so warped by past trauma that they cant and wont see the other side as anything other than broadly monstrous. ID 3313660 Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation David James/Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation ID 3313846 But Dawn of the Planet of the Apes doesnt lean heavily toward any one reading -- its characters or at least its primate ones are too carefully drawn to just be symbols for something else. Its the humans who intentionally frustrate turning out to be bickering and conniving unable to accept that they might no longer be the dominant species. This is a story of humanity receding while holding out hope that things can be rebuilt and returned to what they were. Its a story of apes trying to set up a perfect society on a planet they seem set to inherit. And its ultimately a gracefully told story about how neither of those things works out the way the characters would hope and about how wise and wary Caesar has become its hero even as hes forced to realize that humans and apes have more in common than either would like to admit. Its a hell of a thing to convey when youre not much of a talker but hes more than up to the challenge.

Celebrities Who Have Left Scientology Dawn of the Planet of the Apes By Peter Travers July 9 2014 More News Summer Film Preview 2014 The Season of Fierce Human See Human Do A Complete History of Planet of the Apes All Stories >> Do you remember how gobsmacked we were in 2011 when Rise of the Planet of the Apes opened and we all thought it would suck and well it didnt? Sequel fatigue from four follow-ups to the stellar 1968 original plus Tim Burtons plodding 2001 reboot had left us with less than zero expectations. And then pow Rise got our adrenaline pumping with actors playing apes in motion-capture suits using digital technology to help register ferocity and feeling even in the subtlest eye blink. We were hooked. More News Summer Film Preview 2014 The Season of Fierce Human See Human Do A Complete History of Planet of the Apes All Stories >> The good news about Dawn of the Planet of the Apes set a decade after Rise is that the apes look even better. Hell theyre running stomping gun-toting horseback-riding English-speaking wonders. The downside is that the success of Rise built up impossible hopes for Dawn. Maybe the human actors wouldnt be so lame maybe the grunting plot cliches would be banished to the next Michael Bay film. That didnt happen. Still within the fertile area between promise and execution Dawn is dynamite entertainment especially in the rousing first hour. Taking over the directing reins from Rises Rupert Wyatt Matt Reeves (Cloverfield Let Me In) pinballs us right into the action. The simian virus that James Franco concocted in the last film has enhanced the ape brain but near-decimated the human population. The apes who fled into the woods outside San Francisco are now in charge. Just watch alpha ape Caesar again played by the indisputably great Andy Serkis lead his band of brothers as they swing from trees attack a herd of elk and then vanquish a giant bear. Youll be astonished at what film can do in the digital era. Rise was basically shot in a studio. In Dawn Reeves and cinematographer Michael Seresin bring the 3D technology right out into real space the forests of Vancouver standing in for Northern Cali. The effect inspires awe making you wish that Dawn could truly be a planet of just apes. Its a bummer when the damn dirty humans show up trying to regain the upper hand. The apes are horrified. I was too. No slur on the actors. Thats the esteemed Gary Oldman as a nutso ex-cop who blames the apes for killing his family. And Jason Clarke does what he can as an architect and widower trying to raise his teen son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) while romancing a medic (Keri Russell) and rebuilding a power plant. But how can they counteract a script by Mark Bomback Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver that gets silly especially when the chimps indulge in halting English ""Ape no kill ape""? Critic no kill plot twists except to say that the climactic battle is a humdinger. Save the biggest cheer for Serkis whose triumphant performance is the gold standard in mo-cap acting. Caesars desire for peace puts him in mortal conflict with Koba (the superb Toby Kebbell) an ape who seeks the annihilation of all mankind. In case you miss the point that the same split exists in the human community the script hammers it home repeatedly. As profundity Dawn of the Planet of the Apes falls short. As spectacle its a groundbreaker. Dont Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive breaking news directly in your inbox.

Whoa thats a heavy question. I came here to find out if I should go see a summer blockbuster about talking chimpanzees But ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a heavy movie even if it is hidden in the gorilla suit that is action-adventure entertainment. This franchise now in its second reboot has always had twin purposes. On the one hand talking apes riding horses. Basic dopey kid stuff (there was a cartoon in the 70s) that relied heavily on special effects. On the other hand a none-too-subtle exercise in social commentary that frequently went to dark places. The original 68 film ends with Charlton Heston banging his fist against the sand damning us all to hell. The sequel blows up the earth. The third one ends in infanticide. Why is there war? Its surprising to say but ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is one of the very few movies out there that provides a cogent response to this tough question. Theres also a scene where two angry simians beat the hell out of one another atop a skyscraper. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" begins where the closing credits to ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" ends - watching a graphic of criss-crossing planes carry a new plague around the world. With a little exposition we learn how most of the world drops dead of ""simian flu."" There are a few survivors huddled together in cities unaware if they are the last ones out there. We meet a group out of San Francisco led by Malcolm (Jason Clarke) a good and noble individual and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) another good man who just wants his people to be safe but is perhaps a little more willing to let the ends justify the means. These humans (and others) are sympathetic because we can easily identify with their pre-apocalypse lives. But they are just half the equation. The far more interesting groups are in Muir Woods where Caesar (again motion-captured by Andy Serkis) leads his army of hyper-intelligent apes. Along with a second generation of children we see most of the gang from last time. Theres loyal Rocket wise and friendly Maurice and the rage-infested Koba. The humans need access to a hydroelectric dam to keep their society functioning but it is on Ape land. The Apes just want to live free from humans - nearly all of them were abused in labs prior to the events of this film. Chess moves ensue propelled both by fear and self-interest. Caesar who professes no love for the humans (though maybe still feels a bond with his adopted family led by an off-screen James Franco) recognizes that the way to maintain peace is through cooperation. But anxiety and anger (on behalf of the humans) and ego and envy (on behalf of the apes) quickly leads to violence. The genius of this film lies in that we are rooting for both sides. When the first big battle comes - even with director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"" ""Let Me In"") pulling some characteristic visual tricks out of his sleeve - our feeling is one of dread. The upshot all we want is for this remarkable action to stop. As with so many really difficult conflicts in the world it isnt that one side is all right and the other is all wrong. Everyone has a point and there are good people coming at it from both directions. There are also villains on either side whose character flaws escalate things to their depressing inevitably bloody finale. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is a good and exciting yarn but it is also a bit depressing. Its sci-fi cloak enables viewers to pretty much graft it onto any real world troublespots and it kinda works. Its vagueness to use a critical term (malleability if you are more kind) leads you connect the dots to whichever current event or crisis from history you want. At the end of the day so many of the worlds conflicts boil down to one thing two tribes who are afraid of one another. So a fun summer flick for the whole family? Not quite although the entertainment isnt totally shelved for the good of bellicose allegory. Serkis Caesar gets more than his fair share of rip-snortin badass moments. Hes arguably the finest leader of men weve seen on screen since ""Lincoln."" But dont call him a leader of em. Hes an ape and hes proud and anyone who has a problem with that is likely in for some trouble.

The story keeps a steady clip and the CG effects are impressive but the film never lives up to the promise of the best science fiction and its ability to use the future to tell us something about the present. The 1968 version offered multiple readings from a metaphor about racism to a canny exploitation of our fears of nuclear annihilation and even the 2011 film delved into big ideas about the perils of genetic experimentation and corporate greed in big pharma. (Let us pretend that the 2001 Tim Burton atrocity never happened.) See video Humans Realize Apes Have the Advantage in New Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Trailer (Video) There arent a lot of shades to be found in ""Dawn"" however; most of the characters are either all good completely evil or members of the faceless easily-swayed masses. Mind you that description applies equally to the humans and the apes so theres at least some symbolism at play here. But while most post-apocalyptic sagas hold out a tiny glimmer of hope for mankinds future ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" seems to suggest that the stupidest and most frightened and most violent and most xenophobic among us will wind up ruining everyone elses best efforts. Its ten years after the standoff on the Golden Gate Bridge led by Caesar (portrayed by Andy Serkis the Olivier of motion-capture animation) at the climax of ""Rise."" The worldwide simian flu has wiped out all but one out of every 500 humans and Caesar leads a tribe of apes living relatively peacefully in the Marin County wilderness. Peacefully that is until the day a group of humans shows up with guns. It turns out that theres a cluster of people living in the ruins of San Francisco and theyre hoping to restart a dam in Caesars territory that would bring much-needed power to the city. Caesar drives the humans away after one of the apes gets a gunshot wound but the kind and intelligent Malcolm (Jason Clarke) returns alone and pleads his case to Caesar; the two forge a tense peace as Malcolms crew goes to work on the dam. Dissension on both sides threatens this detente Koba (Toby Kebbell) hates humans for what they did to him when he was a laboratory animal and he vows to make war on homo sapiens with or without Caesars approval. On the other side of the bay Malcolms colleague Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) thinks of the apes as merely savage animals and he prepares an arsenal to fight them off. Also read James Franco Didnt Know He Has a Cameo in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes The characters here (save for Caesar who has Shakespearean levels of inner conflict) are flat and one-note; decide for yourself if returning writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver should bear the blame or if it should go to top-billed scribe Mark Bomback the man behind the listless remakes ""Total Recall"" and ""Race to Witch Mountain."" While Clarke Oldman and Keri Russell (as Malcolms MD wife) mostly flail about in underwritten roles Serkis delivers another extraordinary performance as the franchises most fascinating figure. As Serkis has continually accomplished in a growing body of work the technology involved never gets in the way of his intricate acting. The CG overall is superb here; ""Dawn"" represents in fact exactly the kind of movie that should use the technology not just for the hordes of apes but for the simians empathetic and subtle facial expressions. See video Andy Serkis Creepy Conversation Between Gollum and Caesar the Ape (Video) If the effects fall apart at any point its in the ever-present ""uncanny valley"" thats involved in animating life-like creatures. The intelligent apes look great but the standard-issue grizzly bear (and some of those horses) more often than not register as artificial. For its few visual and many script flaws however director Matt Reeves (""Cloverfield"" ""Let Me In"") balances the splashy set pieces with quieter moments (sullen teen Kodi Smit-McPhee gives a copy of Charles Burns ""Black Hole"" to a wise orangutan named after Maurice Evans) in such a way that ""Dawn"" never feels dull or draggy. It also never feels as excitingly intelligent as its ""Apes"" ancestors. With the next sequel already announced let us hope for evolution. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

(WETA) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday July 9 2014 200 AM Title Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Film Info With Andy Serkis Jason Clarke. Intelligent simians clash with violent humans. Director Matt Reeves (210). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters (3-D in some). Opens Thursday night. ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" is awe-inspiring. Just when it seemed like blockbusters could never evolve in rides this extraordinary epic -- a towering fable of humanity and brutality that takes a great movie myth and launches it forward. Director Matt Reeves story picks up 10 years after ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes."" As that 2011 film ended the hero chimp Caesar -- genetically enhanced and raised among people before experiencing animal-lab cruelty -- led other mutated apes into the Northern California woods. Now the human race has been decimated by a man-made virus global war and civil unrest. Yet Caesar (again portrayed by Andy Serkis) and his advanced tribe live harmoniously in the forest. A group of human survivors seeking to restore a hydroelectric dam to power a portion of destroyed San Francisco encounter the apes. Caesar is wary knowing that mankind makes a wasteland of everything. He worries for his family including his next-in-line son Blue Eyes. Yet when the peaceable Malcolm and Ellie (Jason Clarke and Keri Russell) plead with him Caesar reluctantly agrees with one rule No guns. Malcolm (Jason Clarke) tries to make peace with Caesar (Andy Serkis) Koba (Toby Kebbell) and Maurice (Karin Konoval). (WETA) But the mix is uneasy. Warmongering humans led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) blame apes for the flu that ravaged civilization. And Caesars chimp confidant Koba (Toby Kebbell) scarred by years of animal testing before Caesar freed him has an anger much like the humans -- and like them he ignores its consequences. The story from screenwriters Mark Bomback Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver has several beautifully nuanced elements including how the power- and revenge-mad Koba is more like a descendant of Richard III than of anything in the 1968-73 great ""Apes"" franchise. In that five-film cycle the metaphor of primates running a post-atomic earth was rich with meaning. This reimagining is on an entirely different dramatic level. The tribe of apes on the move through the northern California forest (WETA) The technical triumph is just as dazzling. Using flawless motion-capture technology Serkis (aka Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films) lets us see Caesars soul and psyche his depth and complexity. Consider the gauntlet officially thrown down Serkis deserves a Best Actor Oscar nomination for this work which is nothing short of spectacular. Reeves masterful grown-up guidance is aided by stellar cinematography by Michael Seresin and inventive production design by James Chinlund (skyscraper scaffolding used as monkey bars is one witty touch). This action-filled films primary theme -- how does any species balance its instinct for violence with a desire for peace? -- respects our minds as we grip our seats. ""Dawn"" one of the best films so far this year is a blockbuster born to conquer. jneumaiernydailynews.com Catch ""Joe Neumaiers Movie Minute"" throughout the day Thurs. - Sun. on New Yorks WOR 710 AM and at wor710.com.

Thats one of the best images in Matt Reevess Dawn of the Planet of the Apes the sequel to the enormously successful 2011 Rise of the Planet of the Apes (directed by Rupert Wyatt) in which a bunch of chimps after breathing in a vaporized version of a special serum become super-smart and break out of chimp jail running roughshod over the Golden Gate Bridge and scurrying to eternal safety in the Redwood forest. If youve seen the first movie or even if you havent you may wonder as two fellow critics and I did if a Rise shouldnt actually come after a Dawn. Or perhaps they should occur simultaneously? A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - No matter Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is a much better and far less silly movie than its predecessor It lives so confidently in its invented universe that you almost believe a society of apes could thrive on the outskirts of San Francisco with the little ones learning their alphabet by scrutinizing letters scrawled on the face of a rock and the big ones casting deeply meaningful looks at one another when theyre not communicating via sign language and the occasional spoken word. Hey its San Francisco -- anything goes.The hero of Rise a noble chimp named Caesar (played via motion-capture technology by Andy Serkis) returns in Dawn Caesar is now the leader of ape society which has superseded that of humans after a deadly virus has wiped out most of the worlds population. The apes seem to be doing OK in the forest and Caesar who was raised by human beings (his mom was a lab chimp) has almost forgotten how much he used to enjoy the company of people. Just then a bunch of ragtag human survivors show up led by Jason Clarkes Malcolm with his wife Ellie (Keri Russell as always a sweet grounding presence) and son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) in tow. Theres also a guy named Carver (Kirk Acevedo) who at one point very helpfully announces ""OK Im the asshole."" Because he is the asshole the schmuck who distrusts peaceful Caesar and his fellow chimps and thinks the best thing to do is to blam them away with automatic weapons. Even so it turns out that the scheming chimp Koba (Toby Kebbell) may be the apes worst enemy and a villainous human named Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) shows up now and then to further stir the pot.Film DetailsCritics Pick Dawn of the Planet of the Apes RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time130 More Info Trailer Dawn of the Planet of the Apes doesnt cut particularly deep even though Caesar occasionally utters soulful words like ""home"" and ""family."" (His wife has just given birth to an adorable ape infant with Keane-painting eyes and he also has an older son played by Nick Thurston who learns valuable lessons about leadership and humility and all that good stuff.) But at least Dawn has the distinction of being a summer spectacle that respects its audience instead of just pummeling it into submission. Reeves  who previously directed the lo-fi sci-fi drama Cloverfield as well as Let Me In the superb English-language remake of the Swedish emo-vampire chiller Let the Right One In; he never allows the movies scale colossal as it is to overwhelm the story. He The movie was filmed in 3-D but the movie probably doesnt have to be seen in that format for maximum enjoyment. In fact 3-D technology with its slightly murky tones probably doesnt do Dawn any favors. I kept peering at the screen through those cheap plastic glasses wishing I could somehow get a cleaner more colorful view of the apes silvery fur or the skeleton stripes marching across their chests.Still Reeves does so much right. Hes deft at navigating the movies action including lots of acrobatic chimp-vs.-chimp combat. Theres an unnerving and exhilarating sequence in which those apechimps on horseback charge into the city from the forest pissed as hell. A few chimps and horses also stride peacefully this time through one of the pictures most majestic sequences in which electrical power is restored to an old gas station. An excited human wastes no time cranking up the tunes The song is the Bands version of ""The Weight"" and for a moment apechimps and humans pause to take some pleasure in the sound which drifts through the night like a laid-back cricket symphony.And this time around Serkis seems to have slipped even more comfortably into the role of Caesar. I wasnt a fan of Serkiss ape portrayal in Rise of the Planet of the Apes though it was probably the technology that held him back. Caesar was clearly supposed to look winsome and thoughtful but even when he was doing something sweet like clambering into his surrogate daddys arms for a cuddle I found Serkiss eyes shining through that fake-ape face to be piercing and hostile-looking. Theyre much more expressive here even if they do reflect essentially one emotion Sadness for man-kind and apekind alike weighs heavily on Caesars furry shoulders. The movie ends on a surprisingly somber note particularly for a summer blockbuster. Human beings as always are their own worst enemies but an ape utopia isnt so easy to achieve either. ""I want to sail away to a distant shore/And make like an ape man"" the Kinkss Ray Davies once sang.

This first sequel however plunges us straight into the post-apocalyptic pressure cooker a world of burgeoning ape civilisation and fading human dominance as the survivors of a devastating epidemic huddle in the ruins of old San Francisco. It may lack its predecessors lofty ambitions but once the bullets spears and hairy fists start flying youll be too wrapped up to care. Among the apes the heroic Caesar (Andy Serkis) has retained clan control leading his simian family through a decade of growth and prosperity. But for the humans its a whole different story as desperate leaders Malcolm (Jason Clarke) and Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) debate different strategies for dealing both with an impending power shortage and the encroaching threat of the apes. The effects are nothing short of jawdropping rarely has CGI been employed with such dexterity and depth. Caesar and his followers are complete characters rendered flawlessly down to each wrinkle and back hair (though it can be just a little tricky at times to tell them apart). Cloverfield director Matt Reeves marshals his action sequences superbly - a ferocious central battle is a triumph. The scripts shameless prioritising of brawn over brains can cause problems - the plot twists are signposted a mile off and the human characters tend to lack depth. The complete absence of a decent female character whether human or ape leaves it all feeling a bit punchy and macho. But perhaps thats appropriate for this muscular tale of social collapse and base animal urges.

Well frankly its damn near perfect. Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) has a tight grip on the reins here never letting special effects overwhelm story - Michael Bay please take note - and never letting sentiment become manipulative. The result is a fantastic blend of action and heart with set pieces that wow explosions that literally make your seat shudder an atmospheric score and apes that absolutely steal the show. The human characters are a little 2D but maybe they just seem that way because Andy Serkis is so phenomenal as Caesar leading a dozen other actors to deliver performances that blow their homosapien counterparts out of the water moving you to rage to humour and even to the odd tear.The disturbing sight of an enraged tank-driving machine-gun-wielding Kobo shows the very worst side of humans who shoot first and think later and youll find yourself cheering for the loyal chimps colossal gorillas and utterly lovely orangutan Maurice from the get go.

TWITTER Andy Serkis Jason Clarke Gary Oldman and Keri Russell star in Matt Reeves follow-up to the 2011 reboot. A gripping account of interspecies conflict Dawn of the Planet of the Apes manages to do at least three things exceptionally well that are hard enough to pull off individually Maintain a simmering level of tension without letup for two hours seriously improve on a very good first entry in a franchise and produce a powerful humanistic statement using a significantly simian cast of characters. In the annals of sequels Dawn is to Rise of the Planet of the Apes what The Empire Strikes Back was to Star Wars -- its that much better.  A mainstream blockbuster with a lot on its mind director Matt Reeves synthesis of brains and brawn kicks it over the goalposts and out of the stadium suggesting a box-office haul that will surely exceed the 482 million globally grossed by the 2011 franchise reboot. The films official world premiere took place on June 26 in San Francisco. PHOTOS Dawn of the Planet of the Apes Premiere Whatever anyone might think about the film as a whole there is no question that Andy Serkis gives the most expressive soulful deeply felt performance of a non-human character the big screen has ever offered as the mature Caesar the ape raised from childhood in captivity who now leads a band of a couple of thousand encamped in the Muir Woods north of San Francisco. His Roman namesake notwithstanding the historical figure Caesar most resembles is none other than Abraham Lincoln a wise compassionate fellow with the common touch old before his time his eyes weary from all the suffering hes seen a peaceful sort by nature forced by fate to lead his followers in wartime and who is strong enough physically to take on if pressed any adversary. LIST Hollywoods 100 Favorite Films The situation at the outset is plenty clear so that even those who missed Rise will have no trouble quickly engaging with the action here. In the wake of the massive ape escape from the Gen-Sys Labs and their tear through San Francisco and over the Golden Gate Bridge to Marin County the virulent Simian Virus has over the course of a decade killed the vast majority of Earths human population and left the rest desperate to survive in a world that among previous dystopian depictions is not unlike that of Kevin Costners little-loved but intermittently resonant The Postman. The members of Caesars community are you might say multiethnic; in addition to the dominant apes there are orangutans gorillas and bonobos among others. They communicate mostly through a graceful shorthand sort of sign language that is niftily translated via subtitles. Some of them are also expert horsemen as seen in a startling initial action scene in which apes darting from tree to tree as well as on land make a savage attack on some elk and then battle a large bear. PHOTOS 19 Sequels That Outgrossed the Original Movies Although their homemade compound is a makeshift mess the world they inhabit is gorgeous; watching the film in 3D youre enveloped by dark thick greens wet leaves clouds mist and moisture (although completely convincing as Northern California these scenes were mostly shot in forests near Vancouver and New Orleans). Much has been and will be made of the fact that this is the first time that performance capture 3D has been accomplished in practical settings rather than in a studio; the result is unquestionably stunning just as the sight of up to 50 actors at a time running around in monkey suits is made to look entirely believable. Its been a long time since the apes have seen any humans the few of the latter that remain locally having hunkered down in a decimated foliage-covered San Francisco amassing weapons at the armory and trying to restore electrical power. This effort leads a small troupe led by cautious former architect and widower Malcolm (Jason Clarke) his nurse girlfriend Ellie (Keri Russell) and Malcolms insecure teen son Alexander (Kodi Smit-McPhee) to locate a dam in ape territory a treacherous undertaking that produces startling revelations on both sides; the apes are upset to find that humans even still exist while the latter are shocked to learn that apes can talk. PHOTOS Pulp Fiction Thelma amp; Louise Stars Reunite Although there is mistrust all around Caesar arbitrates a truce but factional fissures quickly appear. Although guns are supposed to be kept locked up some trigger-happy types cant help themselves while one ape in particular Koba (Toby Kebbell) who was a lab monkey in Rise is a rabble-rouser for whom the only good human is a dead human. How each faction struggles to keep its own wayward members in line produces just as much consternation and suspense as does the bigger conflict between the separate species. This aspect of the excellent screenplay by Mark Bomback Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (the latter two the married co-writers and co-producers of Rise) emits grim but timely echoes of any number of contemporary societies coping with conflicts between moderate and extremist elements. It also leads consciously or not to reverberations that go as far back as Jean Renoirs great Grand Illusion which stressed how the same classes of people in opposing nations can have far more in common than do different classes within the same country. So stated the philosophical current in Rise runs entirely contrary to the bad species/good species opposition posited by Pierre Boulle in his mother lode 1963 novel that has been mined for great riches by an initial five-film series beginning in 1968 Tim Burtons best-forgotten 2001 version two TV series and now this new incarnation from which more can surely be expected. PHOTOS 35 of 2014s Most Anticipated Movies With a wary truce being maintained while the humans try to get the dam up and running again to illuminate San Francisco and establish contact with the outside world the worst occurs; the great Caesar thought dead is replaced by Koba the scarred milky-eyed warmonger who imposes himself by intimidation and force. An initial ape foray into the city is shocking and the wanton mass violence that soon follows is just a tightly focused and beautifully staged version of events that keep happening with increasing regularity in poorly ruled areas of the world when guys with guns see a shot at power. There is no human equivalent to the thuggish Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes; Homo sapiens are nervously on the defensive here with minimal resources and uncertain what to expect. Most prominent among them is Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) whose barely referenced background as a lawman does nothing to prepare him for the challenge of fighting an army of artillery-toting apes led by a hate-spewing species supremacist. The big showdown plays out in a trashed rendition of California and Market streets in downtown San Francisco (Godzilla is nowhere in sight) and features quite a few frightening suspenseful and just plain awesome sights. PHOTOS Hollywoods 100 Favorite Films As does the film as a whole. Reeves whose promising work on Cloverfield and significantly better handling of Let Me In were just so much batting practice for what he does here creates a fine dramatic balance between big scenes and small large-scale action and intimate moments while never allowing the nervous energy to flag. Without pummeling the viewer the only thing so many action big-budget-oriented directors seem to know how to do these days Reeves delivers the goods with a fluid sense of imagery and an intelligence more philosophical than geeky or scientific. As far as the acting is concerned the apes have it. Well practiced in this sort of thing Serkis outdoes himself here with a performance suffused in sage humanity; if theres to be another word for it it hasnt been invented yet. Kebbell strongly charts the slow but sure way Koba gathers his nerve to oppose and finally depose the widely admired Caesar. Clarke Russell Smit-McPhee and Oldman are good sometimes unexpected choices for their roles and are spared having to spew stupid ""Oh my God"" dialogue. The film is lustrously beautiful shot by Michael Seresin in masterfully controlled tones that are at once muted and vibrant. The no-doubt extensive CGI effects overseen by master visual effects supervisor Joe Letteri mesh nearly seamlessly with the real backgrounds and the sense of place contributed by James Chinlunds production design is strong both in the country and city. Michael Giacchinos vigorous score is another big plus.

Its always darkest before the dawn goes the saying -- but in resuming a franchise already suspended on a downbeat note ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" sees the simian revolution reaching unprecedented levels of bleak anarchy. An altogether smashing sequel to 2011s better-than-expected ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" this vivid violent extension of humanoid ape Caesars troubled quest for independence bests its predecessor in nearly every technical and conceptual department with incoming helmer Matt Reeves conducting the proceedings with more assertive genre elan than ""Rise"" journeyman Rupert Wyatt. Entirely replacing the previous films human cast but crucially promoting Andy Serkis remarkable motion-capture inhabitation of Caesar to centerstage ""Dawn"" ought to go ape at the global box office starting July 9 smoothing the path for further sequels to test the franchises complexity. Following the robust performance of ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" -- which garnered warm reviews more than 480 million worldwide and an Oscar nomination for its stunning effects work -- ""Cloverfield"" director Reeves inherits the Pierre Boulle-originated franchise in considerably better condition than Wyatt did considering the almighty whiff of Tim Burtons 2001 ""Planet of the Apes"" remake. Credibility restored then itd have been easy to get complacent recycling the ""Rises"" most impressive setpieces and welding them to a hasty resuscitation of its movie-science narrative. Instead Reeves and returning writers Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver (joined by ""The Wolverine"" scribe Mark Bomback) have taken a different tonal tack fashioning the new installment as an out-and-out war drama with surprising subdivisions in its central conflict of man vs. beast and battle scenes to do Weta Digital godfather Peter Jackson proud. The action begins approximately a decade after ""Rise"" left off with a pre-credits montage of global news reports filling in the subsequent drastic developments The ALZ-113 virus (or simian flu) unleashed at the end of the prior film has wiped out most of the worlds human population with a survival rate of less than one in 500. Its a slight red herring of an introduction given that the virus is no longer the most immediate threat to mans day-to-day existence. With all government functions suspended and nuclear power critically depleted any remaining bands of survivors exist in spartan unlit isolation; if the flu doesnt get to them first the lack of basic resources will. San Francisco -- or the post-ape-ocalyptic remainder of it at least -- is once more the setting brilliantly realized by production designer James Chinlund as a gangrenous wasteland of vegetation-swamped slumhouses the citys erstwhile landmarks glumly clothed in rust and moss. Its few residents are led by Dreyfus (Gary Oldman) a former military man bent on revenge against the apes for the loss of his family to the virus. More sanguine is Malcolm (Jason Clarke) who spearheads a project to recover the citys electricity by regaining control of the OShaughnessy Dam. That entails encroaching on the forested domain of the neighboring ape community still ruled with a firm but hairy hand by Caesar; with relations between man and ape already fragile this violation throws fuel on the flames of civil unrest. Though Caesar responds to the diplomatic overtures of Malcolm and his medic wife Ellie (Keri Russell) and grants them limited access to the dam not all his subjects approve. Particularly irate is Koba (Toby Kebbell) a hot-headed human-hating ape with mutinous designs on his leaders position; when an equivalently reactionary member of Malcolms party is revealed to have broken Caesars ""no guns"" condition of cooperation the resulting furor gives Koba the impetus to launch his aggressive counter-movement. (Sadly the writers resist giving Caesar the line ""Et tu Koba?"") The script elegantly constructs its human and ape communities as opposed but markedly similar ecosystems each one internally fractured along lines of relative tolerance toward the other. The ""Apes"" franchise has always been a politically loaded one and this latest entry states its left-wing credo in ways both allegorically implicit and bluntly direct. (Youd have to be pretty obtuse to miss the pro-gun-control subtext attached to misdeeds on both sides of the man-monkey battle.) While the previous film functioned as something of a cautionary tale against mans destructive meddling with his environment ""Dawn"" apportions blame a little more equally as the beasts (introduced in a thrilling technically jaw-dropping faceoff against a grizzly bear) are shown to be no less reckless an influence on the biosphere than their former superiors. ""I always think ape better than human"" Caesar admits to Malcolm his speech patterns having evolved rather rapidly even over the course of this film. ""I see now how like them we are."" Its a reverse epiphany that would have Jane Goodall in tears. Regardless of whose side audiences might take however the fallout is inarguably spectacular. Reeves stages the ensuing crossfire in the human colony with much the same sense of kinetic panic he brought to the flipped monster-movie mechanics of ""Cloverfield"" albeit with far more technical dazzle this time. With most of the below-the-line talent new to the franchise ""Dawn"" has an aesthetic entirely distinct from that of ""Rise"" with Michael Seresins antsy camerawork painting from a strikingly dank palette and Michael Giacchinos chorally embellished score occasionally evoking the grandeur of Howard Shores work on the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. The editing by William Hoy and Stan Salfas rotates multiple points of drama before hurtling into a too-busy finale that sells Oldmans arc particularly short Still while nearly half an hour longer than its predecessor the film certainly doesnt feel it. Naturally though the services of effects wizards Joe Letteri and Dan Lemmon have been retained -- and with even more astonishing results this time with the enlarged population and evolved capabilities of the ape community (who can now ride horses handle firearms and goodness knows what else) posing fresh logistical challenges that are seamlessly met. The fusion of the films motion-capture work with its sophisticated fight choreography is particularly staggering. That Caesars community now seems so integrated and completely characterized is certainly due to Letteri and Lemmons magic though much credit should also go to the actors behind the illusion. Serkis must by now be used to the superlatives heaped upon his agile fusion of performance and image in many a CGI spectacle though hes in particularly empathetic emotionally specific form here; Kebbells brute physicality and wild-eyed animosity meanwhile burns through the digital disguise. Despite Clarkes everyman likability and some reliably gonzo posturing from Oldman the less hirsute ensemble seems a little bland by comparison. Perhaps the films on the side of the apes after all.

Reply johnthekiwi says June 30 2014 at 921 am Sorry but the whole suspension of disbelief thing and mindlessly dystopian grungy future schlock that HWood throws out there just doesnt cut it for me. Being a biotech scientist and someone that has worked with NHPs every premise in this genre is flawed. And if there were only 14 million humans left that represented a plurality of all skill sets and occupations we would soon have the flora of this world back under control. I have or have access to enough firepower to wipe out every simian escapee within a 100 mile radius. Reply Texasbil says June 30 2014 at 1130 am It has been my experience that highly advertised movies are only being treated that way because they are too sorry to stand on their own. Reply General Drake says June 30 2014 at 858 am I dont like any of them really. I love sci-fi but these are just getting ridiculous.

Reply Robb Nunya says June 30 2014 at 646 am There may be an anti-gun sentiment but I wonder how many people will understand the pro-gun logic that guns are the only thing keeping the physically weaker humans even a little bit in the battle. Take away the guns and ht battles over. Thats what guns are. An equalizer for the weak so that they arent immediately run over by the strong. Reply Bob says June 30 2014 at 610 am Based on these comments most of you must be socially depressed. Reply Lakota Jake says June 30 2014 at 429 am Is Andy Serkis the Owner/Licensor/GOD when it comes to motion capture? Nobody can don a ping pong ball suit and hop around? Do I have to see Andy Serkis in EVERY FREAKING CGI movie now. I know he is digitized into a gorilla but what the heck - are they going to call the people who do get the chance to do what he does Serkis-artists? Reply Billy Erwin Cowan Wooton says June 30 2014 at 1228 am Politically I probably am polar opposite of 95% of Hollywood types. Yes films made for the general public (not your overtly political films) have covert or even overt political messages. Most of these messages though speak to the proverbial choir and do not or should not influence peoples political decisions or thoughts reinforcing those things people already beleive. If you are so insecure in your political religious or normative beleifs to be swayed by a piece of entertainment you are probably sitting in that low information section of the information pool that I could not countenance you regardless if your politics and mine mesh or not. This review was well written and I am looking forward to this film. Im sorry for people of either political stripe who let politics interfere with being entertained whether its music television or film. If I let my politics dictate my entertainment choices I wouldnt have many choices to be sure. So sit back relax enjoy the film for enternainments sake...youre not voting for Gary Oldman Ceasar the writers directors or producers of this film....chill out and be entertained. Reply Rob says June 29 2014 at 921 pm Come on man.....thats a pathetic comment.

(montfordgreenwo) says June 29 2014 at 204 pm I will get this in the secondard market. Pro gun control messages means the actors and crew get to work for me for free. So I will buy the used rental and the store gets the money. Reply roboslater says June 29 2014 at 707 pm There are lots of ways of getting this film for free and you dont have to wait for it to come out on DVD for rental. Reply Jay says June 29 2014 at 112 pm It looks like a fantastic movie. I just wonder if it will be diverse enough. I really like my entertainment to be really really filled with diversity. If the apes are all black then I think I wont like it so much. Reply Directorrick says July 3 2014 at 1052 am Bwhahahahahahaha Well done I am always cognizant of the diversity factor and you beat me to the punch.

Reply Mensa graham says June 29 2014 at 1140 am Sean Findley seems to be having a disturbance all on his own. I have a solution better than the ones you proposed - quit ready the comments Reply winstons says June 29 2014 at 1126 am Bingo Reply winstons says June 29 2014 at 1123 am Guess what this film is an allegory for (one hint the apes first language is Spanglish.). For another film- allegory on the same topic see ""No Country for Old (White) Men). Reply Scott says June 29 2014 at 1117 am The animators did a brilliant job bringing the apes-especially Ceasar to life. The acting shows once again how great actors with pencils/pixels are when given challenging material. Reply sean findley says June 29 2014 at 1111 am I tend to be more conservative than liberal but the comments section here is absolutely insane. Some of you people are fucking crazy. I think its about time the whole lot of you unplug from the internet permanently. What is your problem? What on Earth does this film have to do with Jews Karl Marx Obama border insecurities? Holy Christ check yourselves youve gone off the deep end with no return. Reply bitter trekkie says June 29 2014 at 653 pm This comments section is more entertaining than the movie is likely to be. After the last Apes movie thats enough for me. Talking chimps on screen are not endlessly fascinating I guess the talking chimps on the internet are stealing all their thunder.

Mark says June 29 2014 at 408 pm Welcome to what the right-wing base has become a cesspool of paranoid delusional wet-pants white supremacists who see even action movies as a threat. Reply guest says June 29 2014 at 227 pm You couldnt be more wrong. You do know that many movies like the original Planet of the Apes are metaphors right? Whether it be for slavery civil rights illegal aliens communism marxism socialism gun control etc...many movies have a deeper meaning written in to them. They are telling a story that is analogically related to the issue they are trying to address. If you dont know this by now then you are probably the one that needs to stay off the internet as there are a lot of shocking things there that you clearly wont understand. Reply Directorrick says July 3 2014 at 1058 am Filmmakers may have the intent of using their stories as metaphor however we as an audience have the option of just being entertained and walking away. For most important issues that affect us as human beings as Americans or our gender and/or cultural background there are enough actual events that belie the need for cinematic allegory. winstons says June 29 2014 at 1124 am Its an allegory. Can you get that? Reply Scott says June 29 2014 at 1120 am Racism is alive and well in America as evidenced by the comments to a FING MOVIE What a bunch of whack jobs. Reply sean findley says June 29 2014 at 1054 am This guy is a real writer. Excellent review. Highly engaging. Kudos Reply Michael Muetzel says June 29 2014 at 1016 am Tim Burton poor soul is mentally disturbed. Anyone could have made a better film than his. Reply Pure Fluff says June 29 2014 at 1002 am Reblogged this on Pure Fluff and commented It looks awesome. The last one with James Franco was mediocre at best. Reply Klaus says June 29 2014 at 954 am So the message of the movie is Bioweapons OK guns bad. How long would slavery have lasted in America if the slaves had guns? Reply gman says June 30 2014 at 448 pm no no no whether a weapon is good or bad depends upon the target you see. ""Perhaps the films on the side of the apes after all."" well its certainly not on the side of the humans. Reply Janet says June 29 2014 at 159 pm They did get a hold of guns i.e. Nat Turner. They lost anyway and were hanged. Reply fantasticiquattro says June 29 2014 at 526 pm Kam that was John Browns revolt not Nat Turners. Rudy says June 29 2014 at 954 am The coming world war isnt going to be between apes and man; it is going to be between America Britain (and the former Commonwealth) and Europe with the latter two being nuclear bombed out of existence Once that destruction is complete the war will continue between Europe and Russia and China with Europe being annihilated America has become a threat to global stability both monetarily and in terms of her nuclear arms and all the social upheaval at her doorstep. Russia has become or is trying to become the worlds ""policeman"" but that is making Germany very nervous. Watch for some fantastic mind-boggling militarizing to occur in Europe very soon.

Monkeys have prehensile tails and usually live in trees. An ape doesnt have a tail BIG DIFFERENCE RIGHT?

You would think after the spectacular ape effects in 2005s ""King Kong"" we could expect wholly-realistic-looking chimpanzees by now. Unfortunately Caesar still looks rather amateurish and unconvincing. Reply Percival says June 28 2014 at 1052 pm Politically loaded? No kidding? Come one its more than just the gun thing though. The original book (_Monkey Planet_) followed sci-fis traditional examination of what ""human"" means and how we treat each other as far back as Carel Capeks _R.U.R._. Capeks 1920 book which introduced the word ""robot"" was actually about what we would today call artificial human slaves. The POTA movies ask awkward questions of us- do apes deserve ""human rights""? If so are they now our ""slaves""? How you feel about the films (once you get past the graphics) will likely depend mostly on your own political and religious orientation- dont put it all on the filmmakers. Theyre just asking the questions. Sci-fi has been exploring these themes much more deeply than has mainstream literature. Its only in the last few decades that anybody but geeks have been thinking about this stuff seriously. Its about time. Reply Gabriel says June 28 2014 at 914 pm The first POTA movies from the 60s and 70s were a warning to mankind about nuclear weapons ( for the most part) but the new POTA movies seem anti western civilization. It just doesnt sit right with me. Reply Dave Mowers says June 28 2014 at 935 pm Well Gabriel is seems that you are pro-science tampering with GMOs genetically-modified viruses human-animal chimera viral transfer biological viral weapon engineering and a general disregard for billions of years of natural evolution all some some Wall Street-backed IPO can make a few thousand people super rich while guaranteeing the inevitable death of all mankind. I hope you find it was all worth it when the outbreaks start. Reply Toxic says June 29 2014 at 848 am Maybe we need to go back to the Moon and dig up a Monolith that will point us to a larger Monolith that will aid us in evolution. Gabriel says June 28 2014 at 905 pm Based on the first movie and clips of the second is it fair to say the Hollywood left not only hates Americans they also hate humans? Because basically thats what I take away from this movie genre. Its hard to root for the apes who want nothing but our demise throughout most of the show. Its like cheering for AQ Reply punkmaister says June 28 2014 at 803 pm Awesome they sud mae a new POTA V series based on this reboot too Reply dandru says June 28 2014 at 528 pm You guys need to fix this articles deck. ""Man vs monkey"" makes no sense in a film about apes. Monkeys and apes are not the same animals. Thats like describing the film ""Hotel for Dogs"" as a film about wolves. Reply Mike Hohimer says June 28 2014 at 929 pm I guess someone should explain that to the author of the original novel Pierre Boulle whos book was titled ""Monkey Planet"" Reply Big___Al says June 28 2014 at 800 pm Hey dandruff... nobody cares about the excruciating minutia of the difference between monkeys and apes except you.
