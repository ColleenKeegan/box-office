Or more precisely does over-hype still exist? Its become the movie industry standard to make sure that every man woman child and pet on the planet is salivating over each new release and 24-hour information-spewers like cable TV and the Internet will see to it from here on out that thatll never change. Audience ""reaction"" is practically created by the production company then applied like a sunscreen against weak reviews. Even by todays bloated standards though Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchezs sometimes blindingly frightful homemade horror movie ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a special case. Due to advance raves from the Sundance Film Festival -- and a well-designed Web site that adds considerably to the movies creepy mystique -- ""Blair Witch"" garnered a sizable cult following far in advance of it actually opening. From a premature raving standpoint its ""Eyes Wide Shut"" minus the huge budget big stars fancy lighting elegant camera work and Stanley Kubrick. Audiences (and a great many critics) will be jumping up and down about the whole thing even though it only contains about 30 minutes of honestly laudable footage. They are however a superb absolutely terrifying 30 minutes. This is a mock documentary to some degree but its raw hand-held look doesnt allow even that much formality. The premise is that on October 21 1994 three student filmmakers (well played by Heather Donahue Joshua Leonard and Michael C. Williams) headed off to the hills of Maryland to make a documentary about the possibly imaginary Blair Witch who may or may not have been responsible for a handful of grisly deaths over the years. Unfortunately the filmmakers never came back. A year later their footage was somehow discovered and what were looking at is the unnerving altogether mystifying evidence of what happened to them. Improvised script shots Nearly all of ""The Blair Witch Project"" is improvised. Myrick and Sanchezs truly inspired approach to the film was to let their cast wander the woods for several days with a tape recorder 16-millimeter camera and home video camera in tow documenting the distant noises and disturbing warning signs that their ""directors"" were leaving for them in the cover of darkness. Then hours of evidently rambling footage was edited down to one little movie thats designed to slowly build on you like a nervous breakdown. Peppered throughout are supremely disquieting set pieces that (sometimes literally) shout ""What the hell is that?"" Before we get to the good stuff though we have to deal with the movies huge nearly crippling problem. It pains me to do so because the successful sequences are so resoundingly successful. However it must be noted that if you havent had a couple cups of coffee before sinking down in your seat you may find yourself unexpectedly watching ""The Blair Insomnia Project."" The level of repetition when the students lose their way is disconcerting for a while just as the directors intended it to be. But any semblance of drive is soon dumped in favor of a meandering ""realism"" thats normally cut out of other films for very good reasons. Myrick and Sanchez are obviously struggling so hard to stretch this baby out to even 82 minutes you find yourself rooting for the witch after a while. You cant really say that theres character development in the conventional sense but you do get to see the close-knit group disintegrating before your eyes. In real time. To a large degree the movie is about the horror of group dynamics. Donahues character is the director of the ""documentary"" and she endlessly badgers her slacker companions to get this shot get that shot cross the stream keep the camera rolling etc. Shes like the straight-A student bossing everyone around behind the counter at McDonalds. She turns out to be the one whos most responsible for their predicament (her map-reading skills leave a lot to be desired) and when her friends finally lose it and try to belt her in the side of the head you cant help but feel a secret thrill. Its just that it takes them so long to get to that point youll probably want to belt the projectionist first. It really becomes trying after about 40 minutes and youve got a long way to go from there. Genuinely frightening But lets talk about the soon-to-be-legendary scares. Whenever night falls the movie takes off but in a slow creep with all your childhood fears of the dark suddenly revealing themselves as absolutely reasonable. Since the weak-registering video camera is the main source of recording the events many of the most frightening sequences play themselves out on a virtually black screen. Its bad enough when the students climb into their tent for the night and start hearing strange unexplained popping sounds surrounding them in the distance but the moment when a crying baby echoes through the darkness is wildly terrifying.

(Honest to God I just got goose bumps thinking about it.) Not to give anything away (the movie is so vague about whats happening thats almost impossible) but the final sequence is the stuff of sheer unadulterated nightmares. The images themselves with the video cameras light dimly sweeping across things that youre certain you dont want to see are hellish. It really looks like the moment when you force yourself to wake up not wanting to proceed a step further into the ravings of your sleeping imagination. It takes a long time getting there but the films pay-off is all the more powerful for being a lonely dull thud. Its just you and your worst fears battling to the death. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is scary because it doesnt really show you anything ... a lesson that other horror directors would be well-served to learn. Theres only a brief moment when you see blood but it registers like a howitzer. For the most part the soundtrack is what does it to you. If you like to camp out but still get a little creeped by unexplained noises DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. (Theres also a ton of ""F"" words which is understandable given the characters predicament.)

BY Jami Bernard NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Monday January 25 2016 1130 AM (Originally published by the Daily News on July 14 1999.) If ""The Blair Witch Project"" hasnt reinvented the horror movie at least it has genetically altered the genre and produced a scary new strain of nailbiting entertainment. This blow-by-blow account of the ""disappearance"" of a young documentary crew is creepy to the bone and features one of the most discomfiting windups in recent film memory. (At least since 1988s ""The Vanishing."") Thanks to advance buzz from Sundance and a killer Web site that breaks new ground in cross-promotional hype ""The Blair Witch Project"" was a cult hit before it even opened. The movie is presented as a pastiche of actual footage shot by three film students who were never seen again after hiking into Marylands Black Hills Forest in search of their subject a legendary witch with an unsavory fondness for children. After interviewing a few locals and counting their chickens before hatching the threesome sets off with tents backpacks and not enough food. The footage they left behind in the woods is ostensibly all that is left of them. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez are the brains behind the Blair Witch both the movie and the mythology but they cannily fade into the woodland shadows to let the three stars act so much like the characters they play that you can hardly separate them out. Heather Donohue Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard play Heather Michael and Joshua earnest and youthfully obnoxious film students on a mission. New York Daily News review of ""The Blair Witch Project"" published July 14 1999. (New York Daily News) Armed with Joshuas 16mm camera and Heathers High-8 video they record every increasingly unhappy moment of their trek through the woods including sleepless nights endless bickering over the loss of their bearings and eerie discoveries of stick bundles and other totems. Adding to the movies realistic feel the three actors actually took the cameras into the woods and the footage is indeed theirs. They had a vague idea of what was expected of them but each days work was ""directed"" by notes left for them along the route. During this extended camping excursion the film makers messed with the actors heads drying up the food supply for example and haunting their tents. The resulting exhaustion confusion and terror look so real its no wonder that fans are seizing on the rather elaborate Blair Witch backstory (just take a look at www.blairwitch.com) despite knowing in their hearts that as the saying goes its only a movie. How this movie was made has everything to do with its reception. It is a happy confluence of form and function in which a low-budget film uses low-tech equipment to affect a cinma-vrit style. The very crudeness of the film stock and technique contribute mightily to the feeling that things are out of control disoriented and possibly subject to unnatural laws. The movie is not without the kind of flaws that come with a lack of polish some dull spots and repetition for example. But the inexplicably terrifying ending is good for a months worth of nightmares no small thing for a movie in such a saturated field.

The witches and goblins in the windows are a sly signal that while The Blair Witch Project may be a trick its also a treat for the audience.In current Hollywood horror the only things that creak louder than the door to the dark basement are the cliches and manipulations. The movies dont scare the viewers so much as wink at them in a knowing conspiracy. Instead of well-earned screams you get Scream. In this climate its a real challenge to come up with a film thats genuinely disturbing even if its a fake.The work of Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick two young Florida filmmakers who had no money to spend The Blair Witch Project is a classic example of necessitys being the mother of invention. The premise of the movie is simplicity itself.Three equally hard-up young filmmakers decided to shoot a documentary about the Blair Witch a macabre legend about a figure supposedly responsible for the deaths of many local children over the last two centuries.The trio went into the woods in the fall of 1994 and vanished. If they were not heard from again they were seen - albeit under bizarre circumstances. The only trace of them was their abandoned car and the footage they shot before their still-unsolved disappearance. The approach to their mysterious fate in The Blair Witch Project - call it an exercise in hocus focus - is to make a tall tale as believable as possible. It is brilliantly sustained.The Blair Witch Project is a film within a film within a film. Director Heather Donahue shoots the documentary sequences in 16mm black and white. She also uses Super 8 video to chronicle the behind-the-scenes making of the movie. Both formats left by Donahue are used in the compilation of the overall movie. Myrick and Sanchez dont fess up until the final credits which acknowledge simply that the footage was written edited and directed by them.Although they disdain - or couldnt afford - high-tech gimmicks the two directors do everything possible to maintain the plausibility of their proposition. The style is cinema verite and the home-movie jerkiness only adds to the growing sense of peril that engulfs Donahue and her two-man crew - Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard.The three actors use their real names and its a choice that reflects the conviction they bring to the roles. The way the narrative unfolds is straightforward and framed as a documentary but it wouldnt work without some finely calibrated judgment by Donahue Leonard and Williams. Each establishes a defined personality and their responses to every new crisis are very persuasive. They illuminate character even in the gathering darkness. The aura of credibility in The Blair Witch Project owes much to their contribution.After interviewing some townspeople Donahue heads into the forest with her film crew. Its gratifying to see a take-charge woman in the lead in this genre instead of another parade of ingenues being slaughtered. Soon the three are hopelessly lost and surrounded by ominous signs that they are not alone. An air of understandable panic begins to overwhelm them.There are of course several things not the least of them common sense that give this game away long before the final credits. Its a sensational story that somehow never made the newspapers. And no one would keep filming in the face of the mortal danger the students encounter.So you can dismiss The Blair Witch Project as a trick. Or you can give in to the treat and savor that rarest of accomplishments in a field notorious for tedium and repetition - an original horror movie.THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT    1/2 Produced by Gregg Hale and Robin Cowie written and directed by Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick photography by Neal Fredericks music by Tony Cora distributed by Artisan Entertainment.

"The Blair Witch Project (R) Related Items Go to Video Finder Transcript from a live talk with the directors ""Blair Witchs"" dizzy spell Documentary Style Aids Blair Witch By Lloyd Rose Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 16 1999 Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick direct the thriller. (Artisan) Director Daniel Myrick; Eduardo Sanchez Cast Heather Donahue; Michael Williams; Joshua Leonard Running Time 1 hour 28 minutes Macabre material and strong language ""The Blair Witch Project"" is the scariest movie Ive ever seen. Not the goriest the grossest the weirdest the eeriest the sickest the creepiest or the slimiest. Not the most haunting most disturbing most horrific most violent most beautiful most dreamlike or most vile. Just flat out the scariest. Scarier than ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" Scarier than the shower scene in ""Psycho"" the first time you see it. Scarier than the final twist in ""Carrie"" and the shark attacks in ""Jaws."" Scary to the bone. In October of 1994 a brief written prologue informs the audience three film students from Montgomery College went into the woods near Burkittsville Md. to shoot a documentary about a local legend called the Blair Witch. They were never seen again. However - and here is the films simple exquisite conceit - a year later their equipment and film were found buried in the foundation of a deserted house and it is this unfinished footage supposedly pieced together by directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez that is the film that we the audience are told we are watching. A movie within a movie ""The Blair Witch Project"" is presented as interrupted unverifiable cinema verite a patchwork of the actual film work on the students documentary and a simultaneously video-recorded diary of the making of that documentary. Director Heather Donahue cameraman Joshua Leonard and sound man Michael Williams (all the characters have the same names as the actors who play them) pile into Joshs car one October morning and head up to Burkittsville. Heather wants man-in-the-street interviews about the staying power of the 200-year-old legend as well as shots of sites connected with the Witch Coffin Rock for example where in 1886 some men who had been searching for a vanished child were found bound dead and disemboweled. Before anyone could make sense of the strange letters carved into their faces the bodies mysteriously disappeared. Some of the present-day townspeople have heard the Witch stories some arent sure. Those who have mention the hermit who in the 1940s lured children to his forest cabin and slaughtered them or bring up the claims of a local nut to have seen in the woods a woman covered with short hair ""like a horse."" As a mother talks to the camera her 2-year-old daughter held in her arms keeps putting a hand over Moms mouth Dont tell Dont ask either the audience thinks nervously but in the time-honored fashion of horror movie characters everywhere our heroes strike off into the woods. This isnt some mysterious shadowy Gothic forest. Its scrubby and scraggly in the most banal way and as the filmmakers become progressively more lost these dull ugly woods seem to swell as if from some psychic sap with terror. If ever a movie proved that what you dont see is scarier than what you do this one is it. Because Heather and her crew dont know the real story theyre filming - the story of their doom - their cameras catch bits and pieces of random action. The audience has to piece things together from sequences that stop in the middle or gaze for a long boring minute or so at a shot of weeds while the camera momentarily forgotten the characters argue. We never get quite enough information to figure out whats happening but - thanks to the scriptstructure worked out by Myrick and Sanchez - we always get enough to make us dread whats coming next. Though the story was plotted very carefully the dialogue was improvised. The raw amateurish-seeming scenes that result with their repetitiveness and lack of focus only pull us deeper into the films illusion that what were seeing really happened. The actors who actually spent several days in the woods eating less and less and never quite sure what was going on come apart harrowingly. Its ghost story aside the movie is a nerve-racking account of a group of people going to pieces under stress. Presented as an incomplete student film ""The Blair Witch Project"" of course is a student film that is to say experimental in love with the medium irreverent and high-spirited. With its whats-real? playfulness and antic use of film conventions the movie is like Orson Welless famous 1938 radio broadcast of ""The War of the Worlds"" in which Welles forsook ordinary dramatic narrative and instead pretended to ""break into"" a regular broadcast with a series of increasingly disturbing ""news announcements."" A hysterical nation ran screaming into the streets. Like that youthfully impetuous near-hoax Myrick and Sanchezs movie is a work that plays - with form technical possibilities audience expectations and the idea of a show as a magic trick.

Directed and written by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. 87 minutes. Neptune. ""R"" - Restricted because of language. ""Its a fake"" shouted a spoilsport at a preview screening of ""The Blair Witch Project"" a couple of days ago. Well yes. But its an awfully ingenious fake a ""documentary"" that doubles as a horror film as three young filmmakers head off to Marylands Black Hills Forest to investigate a local legend about a demonic apparition. Were told at the outset that they disappeared in 1994 leaving only this haunting footage of their experiences. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez the co-directors of this elaborate hoax took the audience by surprise at the Sundance Film Festival last January when many reportedly bought the premise and swallowed the story whole. Even at Seattle test screenings a few weeks ago audiences were still spooked. But Myrick and Sanchez may have outwitted themselves by creating such a well-oiled promotional machine that the movies big secret can no longer be kept. Earlier this week they probably compounded their problems by presenting an hour-long television special ""Curse of the Blair Witch"" that also presented this whopper with a straight face. It may have been too much. ""The result is a mind game made by skilled hands"" wrote Laura Fries in Variety. ""Sanchez and company have broken the rules with this TV special and with their movie but to give away too much would spoil the fun."" Some of the fun may already be spoiled as that heckler demonstrated. Theres evidently a Blair Witch Backlash movement that sees the picture as little more than self-induced hysteria. In a sense theyre right but isnt that what all horror movies are? As a piece of filmmaking ""The Blair Witch Project"" deserves respect. Using the most modest means Sanchez and Myrick manage to tell a compelling story create recognizable characters and hold our attention even when theres literally nothing on the screen. Parts of the picture resemble a radio play thats designed to raise goose pimples. Effective as the hand-held camera work often is its the soundtrack (and the conviction of the actors) that truly distinguishes this film. We cant help wondering along with the ""doomed"" filmmakers huddled inside their tent whos out there apparently stalking them. Heather Donahue makes the strongest impression as the documentarys take-charge director who keeps shooting footage even when her sound man (Michael Williams) and her cameraman (Joshua Leonard) think they have other priorities. Utterly lost in the woods they scream insults at each other blame each other for their predicament and begin to feel that theyre really in danger. At first the arguments are petty and amusing (one debate involves memories of ""Gilligans Island""). But then their fears appear to be confirmed by sightings of peculiar twig formations and organized rock piles and by sinister noises in the night. It all ends badly though not quite in the way youd expect. The final images are so chaotic and inexplicable that you find yourself trying to piece together the end of the story as you would if you really did find such footage. This is calculated manipulative low-budget filmmaking at its most creative. Suspension of disbelief may be a problem in the context of the hype surrounding this movie. But seen by itself without the media overkill ""The Blair Witch Project"" works. Copyright (c) 1999 Seattle Times Company All Rights Reserved.

Is it more frightening to be eaten by a monster or to live in fear of such a fate? Eduardo Sanchez and Dan Myricks debut film The Blair Witch Project leaves its horror to the audiences imagination and in doing so creates a truly scary horror film something akin to a lost art these days. An opening screen announces that the movie consists of footage recovered from three lost student filmmakers who disappeared in the Maryland woods while searching for the legendary Blair Witch and never allows anything to shatter that illusion. Shot with handheld cameras Blair Witch has the look of a student film and its accompanying outtakes but more importantly it feels real. Its three principals (Heather Donahue Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard) all give fine performances creating fully realized characters from apparently candid moments in the films first half and doing a thoroughly convincing job of appearing scared witless in its second. And scary it is but in a way not seen too often before. Blair Witchs novel approach relies almost entirely on suggestion and implication tapping into the same feelings conjured by a mysterious creak in an empty house. Like the original version of The Haunting and Peter Weirs Picnic At Hanging Rock Sanchez and Myricks film knows that whats not seen frightens more easily that what is and that the imaginations thoughts of what might have happened generally horrify on a deeper level than knowing what did.

"Bare Bones Slate Sign In Sign Up Bare Bones Bare Bones Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 23 1999 930 PM Bare Bones The Blair Witch Project flays the horror genre--and the viewer; The Haunting is all flab. By David Edelstein The Blair Witch Project Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez Artisan EntertainmentThe Haunting Directed by Jan De Bont DreamWorks SKG The Blair Witch Project demonstrates that theres nothing scarier than nothing. The movie has no ghosts or witches on display and its lone bit of gore is a piece of cloth containing a mottle of indeterminate organic material. It has no surprises either since you know going in that the ending wont be happy. The movie opens with a placard declaring that three film students went into the woods near ""Burkittsville Maryland"" to make a documentary and were never heard from again and that their footage was discovered a year after their disappearance. The placard doesnt mention who edited the footage--the ghost of Hitchcock? Cassavetes?--but thats a minor point. I could tell you the story--give away every detail--and The Blair Witch Project would still freeze your blood. Working on a budget thats chump change and a script thats little more than a framework for actors improvisations directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have harnessed the most irrational fears of every human alive. They have reanimated the genre not by adding to it but subtracting from it--by cooking it down to its bare bones and then rattling those bones like fiends. Advertisement The first thing theyve done is remove the omniscient point of view. With the important exception of that opening title card there is no larger perspective. The film students--a woman Heather Donahue and two men Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard (the characters bear the actors names)--tote their own video and movie cameras so that we see what they see and no more. Actually we see even less since we lack their peripheral vision and are cruelly limited to whatever passes through their lenses. Thanks to first-rate sound equipment though we hear everything they hear--especially a snapping of branches in the dark outside their tent that escalates into an omnidirectional clatter. When they yell into the darkness (""Hello?"") the darkness remains dark. A light illuminates the foreground but the blackness beyond that pool seems if anything blacker. There might be no more irrationally terrifying shot in the annals of film than the one in which the camera hurtles behind Heather--a hazy white streak in the center of the screen--amid crackling sounds as she throws a look into the trees and shrieks ""What is that? What the fuck is that?"" We never see what the fuck that is. If we did some part of us would probably relax because it would look like a special effect. But no part of us is allowed to relax. Ever. I s The Blair Witch Project a work of ""art""? Not by my definition. Art rarely tortures you so single-mindedly. After the first half-hour in which the students interview Burkittsville residents about the history of the Blair Witch (one Elly Kedward found guilty of sorcery in 1785 and lashed to a tree during a harsh winter) the remainder of the movie is their increasingly desperate odyssey through the woods. They trudge one way double back pore over maps and compasses whine trudge some more come upon mysterious piles of rocks or bundled twigs and whine even louder. The action unfolds in a season halfway between autumn and winter and the washed-out tones suggest that the Blair Witch took the forests colors with her when she died. The grueling monotony is broken only at night when the students go into their tents and the sounds come again and the very celluloid seems to shiver with cold and fear. The camera twitches incessantly The lone stationary shot is when Heather sobs an apology to her parents for having dreamed up the project and the way shes framed and half-lighted she looks like Lon Chaneys Phantom of the Opera with nostril hair. I dont apply the adjective ""visceral"" casually The shaky camera summons up our fight-or-flight responses. Leaving the screening my wife was convinced she had food poisoning from an earlier meal; when we stopped and analyzed her symptoms we realized that she had motion sickness. The movie had literally made her sick. The power of that cant be slighted however. I love horror pictures and am a tough scare but I started having nightmares about The Blair Witch Project before I even saw it--solely on the basis of its preview. I slept even less after I did see it. When I caught an interview with the superbly nervy Heather Donahue on television the first thing I thought was ""Thank God shes alive."" Then she said ""This movie must be working because people come up to me all the time and say Thank God youre alive. "" The other day an envelope arrived at my door with a bunch of sticks lashed together in the familiar form of the Blair Witch talisman. I rushed to the phone and called the movies publicists to make sure this was a promotional gimmick. When they said yes I started breathing again; otherwise I might have called the police--or an exorcist. W hat is it about The Blair Witch Project that taps into such primal emotions? Consider its antithesis. The remake of The Haunting has the bad fortune to open in the same month and what might have been dismissed as just a lame overstuffed big-studio scare picture will now be held up as a counterexample. Robert Wises 1963 original based on Shirley Jacksons The Haunting of Hill House is overrated but it manages to evoke the eeriest aspect of Jacksons fiction the way the characters neuroses acquire an inexorable life of their own and threaten to eat them alive. Nothing much happens in the empty mansion but when something does--for instance a thunderous pounding on a pair of big doors as if all the characters accumulated nervous energies had been focused on one spot--the movies reticence pays off like gangbusters (or ghostbusters). In the new version directed by Jan De Bont (Speed 1994; Twister 1996) that pounding comes early and serves as an overture for a bunch of computer-generated special effects ghosties that swirl around like Tinkerbell statues that spring to life and grab people. Everything is exasperatingly often laughably overexplicit and once a dread becomes material a ghost story becomes a monster movie--a different far less terrifying beast. Here are sound effects so hammy that they might have been borrowed from one of those old haunted-house party albums. Doors dont creak they CRRRREEEAAAKKK and then close with a reverberant KER-CHUNGGGGGG. From the second Liam Neeson and his subjects--Catherine Zeta-Jones Lili Taylor and Owen Wilson--set foot in the farcically garish Hill House its clear that Something Evil is watching them You can tell because Something Evil respires so loudly that hes either Darth Vader or an asthmatic. By the time poor Taylor stands up to the big bad ghost on behalf of a lot of little good ghosts people in the audience are holding onto their stomachs to keep from retching with laughter. Writing directing acting--this is one of the most maladroit ghost movies ever made. But even if the script werent so tin-eared and the direction so clunky The Haunting still wouldnt come within screaming distance of The Blair Witch Project. The reason is philosophical. De Bont a lavish materialist who thinks that movies can do anything if you throw enough money around wants to scare you by showing you stuff. Myrick and Sanchez want to scare you by not showing you stuff--and by reminding you how much you cant see and will never know. With all those cameras onscreen theyve liberated horror from the realm of movies--from the realm of the light--and nestled it back into the dark where it was born.

Comments The Blair Witch Project Rated R  81 minutes  1999 A pretty impressive horror film in the form of a documentary supposedly made up of footage shot by three film students on a trek through Marylands Black Hills Forest to investigate legends about a witch. What gives the film much of its force and its mounting sense of queasy uncertainty is its narrative method which ensures that we know no more about the proceedings than the characters do and that our imaginations play as active and ambiguous a role as theirs. Written directed and edited by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez; with Heather Donohue Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard all of whom do fine jobs.

By Andrew Sarris  08/16/99 1200am Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchezs The Blair Witch Project represents the ultimate triumph of the Sundance scam Make a heartless home movie get enough critics to blurb in near unison ""scary"" and watch the suckers flock to be fleeced. This fictional documentary within a pseudo-documentary form may be the most overrated under-financed piece of film to come down the pike in a long time. Incidentally when did ""scary"" become the highest commercial accolade a movie could receive? Not that The Blair Witch Project struck me as particularly scary even by infantile standards. Where is the suspense? Where is the involvement? Where is the identification? We know from a printed foreword that the three young film-makers are doomed and by the time I got to know them a little I didnt much care what happened to them. In accordance with the coy nomenclature of this faux-found footage the actors and the characters have the same first names. Thus Heather Donahue plays and is Heather the domineering young woman director of the trio. Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard play Mike and Josh Heathers goofily surly helpmates. I didnt catch what exactly the two guys did in the way of technical functions but they never seemed too impressed with Heathers capabilities which makes one wonder why they trusted her to lead them into an unknown forest all three of them carrying backpacks so heavy and bulky that Hannibal would have hesitated loading them on his elephants when he was crossing the Alps toward Rome. Go back I kept saying to myself. Go back But Heather the bitch was in no mood to listen. She thought she knew everything. You could tell from the early on-camera interviews she arranges with a variety of local yokels. Her broadly supercilious tone makes it clear that she considers herself superior to everyone around her and that includes Mike and Josh whom she treats as her slow-witted slaves. Heathers unsympathetic smugness from the outset strangely is what has made the movie such a big hit with audiences and critics. Im willing to bet anything that if the movie had been simply about three guys lost in the woods it wouldnt have gone anywhere critically or commercially. The antifeminist-backlash spectacle of a pushy female leading two comparatively inoffensive males to be slaughtered by persons unknown and unseen gives the audience a ready-made scapegoat for the disaster. I was struck also by the complete absence of any erotic tension or fraternal friendliness between the guys and the girl even before the three fools are frightened out of their wits by strange wooden markers and burial mounds of carefully arranged stones. All the while I kept wondering why they started out on this silly project in the first place. Indeed I was so detached from the mission that I began noticing things that didnt make sense in the context of the sheer terror of the experience. Why do they keep lugging around their backpacks long after it becomes clear that they should be running for their lives? Yet the filmmakers do deserve credit for a clever image in the last 10 seconds that at least works poetically but that is not nearly enough for all the low-budget leave-it-to-the-audiences-imagination pretentiousness that precedes it. I was reminded of nothing so much as the low-budget cat-people-in-total-darkness shenanigans of producer Kirk Douglas and director Barry Sullivan in Vincente Minnellis The Bad and the Beautiful (1952) from a studio-savvy screenplay by Charles Schnee. Actually Heathers camcorder-run-amok antics makes her even more irritating to a viewer forced to look at seemingly endless dead footage of trees and shrubbery. I must confess that from the age of 5 I cannot remember ever wanting to be scared by a movie. Moved yes. Amused yes. Thrilled yes. Turned on yes. But scared never. These days I get my fill of fear and horror by reading the daily obituaries in The New York Times . Still there have been a few instances of my being vicariously scared despite my well-developed distancing defenses. (Its only a movie Andrew.) When I saw Psycho (1960) on the first day of its theatrical release without any advance buzz or screenings the shower scene made me scream; it confirmed for me my mother complex. How could she go that far to complicate my already messed-up sex life? As a consequence Psycho  for all its formal perfection as an insightful work of art has never come close to being my favorite Hitchcock film ranking far below Vertigo (1958) Shadow of a Doubt (1943) Notorious (1946) and Rear Window (1954). After Psycho  for me the only truly frightening premise for a horror film is to be found in Wes Cravens A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). Why? Because dreams are among the few things we can never control in our lives and the idea that our dreams can invade our existence with homicidal impunity constitutes a waking nightmare. But the spectacle of three film-student types traipsing off cluelessly into an unfamiliar forest with a reported history of gruesome violence is just plain stupid. And since you never really get to know these lambs led to slaughter it is as if you were ghoulishly watching a horrible automobile accident from a safe vantage point. There is more than a trace of banal horror movie trickery involved in getting the audience agitated by the hysterical screaming of a female character too full of guilt and shame over her fatal incompetence for us to identify in any way with her plight. This is what I didnt like about the climax of Henri-Georges Clouzots Les Diaboliques (1955) with weak-hearted Vera Clouzot screaming up a storm to cue and amplify the audience reaction. By now the inescapable triumph of evil and just plain nastiness has become commonplace in American movies. Young people particularly seem to be drawn to the most mindlessly nihilistic messages in movies. I am not sure why and I have long ago stopped worrying about it. As it is I find The Blair Witch Project much less hateful than Arlington Road with its more expert projection of a satanically debilitating paranoia. But I dont give The Blair Witch Project extra points for being so cheaply made. Many of my esteemed colleagues have chosen to use this unexpected money-maker as a club to beat the overpriced overgadgety overdigitalized and overhyped mainstream turkeys gobbling up the multiplexes. Emotional emptiness unfortunately is unacceptable in a movie whatever its budget. Martin and Murphy Mock Hollywood and Vice Versa Frank Ozs Bowfinger  from a screenplay by Steve Martin takes a stab at synergizing the talents of two of the funniest men in showbiz but the union of Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy does not so much multiply the mirth as fractionate it not because of any lack of chemistry between these two comic talents but because the idea of doing a parody of todays Hollywood movie-making is self-defeating. A more challenging trick would be to make a movie taking todays Hollywood at all seriously. Even so Mr. Martins screenplay is surprisingly heavy-handed with the subject at hand. I say surprisingly because Mr. Martins previous collaborations with director Oz- Little Shop of Horrors (1986) Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988)  Housesitter (1992)-were subtler and sweeter comic confections than they were given credit for being at the time. Bowfinger  by contrast though not mean-spirited never quite achieves enough credibility to justify the strenuousness of the physical maneuvers necessary to show a movie being shot with an action star unaware that he is in the cast. Mr. Martin as Bobby Bowfinger down-at-the-heels producer-director of the barely breathing Bowfinger International mostly a figment of his answering machines imagination thinks he has a winner in a sci-fi aliens script written by an Iranian-American accountant and entitled Chubby Rain since the aliens invade the earth as particularly portly raindrops. There is enough whimsy in this one conceit to sink an aircraft carrier in the Nimitz class. Every time the title is repeated in any form the whole cast of woeful wannabes limps along behind it. Mr. Murphy in the dual role of paranoid action star Kit Ramsey and his more sweet-tempered non-celebrity brother Jiff generates some Jekyll-and-Hyde merriment with his undeniable mimetic gifts. The very powerful screen presences of Robert Downey Jr. as Jerry Renfro a coldhearted Hollywood power broker and Terence Stamp as a sinister cult leader are insufficiently utilized to make much impact. Similarly Christine Baranskis comic flair begins to wheeze from the excesses of her self-caricature as a Norma Desmond without the oil wells. Heather Graham as Daisy the opportunistic small-town ingenue sleeping her way to the top is too relentlessly one-note in her characterization. The result is painlessly disappointing but the Republic will survive. Betting on Dostoyevsky Karoly Makks The Gambler  from a screenplay by Katharine Ogden and Charles Cohen and Nick Dear is well worth seeing for its gritty homage to both the genius and the ruinous gambling obsession of Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1821-1881). The incomparable Michael Gambon as a full-throttle Dostoyevsky is alone worth the price of admission for his projection of the authors gift of ironic alertness to the lies his characters and acquaintances keep telling themselves. The rest is bits and pieces that are more interesting as period background than as dramatic entertainment. Mr. Gambon is ably supported by Jodhi May as Anna Snitkina one of Russias first stenographers the authors muse and his final companion; Polly Walker as Polina his ever-tormenting temptress and Dominic West as Aleksei the novelists fictional alter ego at the gambling tables. Luise Rainer who won two consecutive Academy Awards returns to the big screen with the juicy role of the self-destructive grandmother and gives it all her supercharged Viennese bravura of so many decades ago. The Gambler  like Shakespeare in Love  continues the welcome trend of honoring great cultural figures as a counterpoint to the more fashionable worship of depravity and insanity.

Make that a choking last gasp of desperation and fear. Presented as if showing real events the film is about three college students who enter deep woods in Maryland to shoot a documentary about a creepy legend. It seems a woman charged with witchcraft in 1785 was banished from the town of Blair. Mysterious disappearances and horrific deaths have hit the area ever since the last time in 1941. Like Jonathan Harker naively approaching Castle Dracula Heather Donahue Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams (the actors lend their real names) explore the legend in October 1994. They venture forth with a 16 mm camera a camcorder camping equipment and a map they have trouble reading. They are never heard from again. A year later their raw footage is found from which this film was assembled -- or so the story goes. The result is a remarkable exercise in scaled-down yet powerful cinema verite written edited and directed by Ed Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. The actors themselves shot all the footage -- surely this is a first for movies -- and some may balk at the deliberate crudeness of their visuals. These mix black-and-white film stock with color video most of it jumpy poorly focused and badly framed. Yet these arent affected ""shaky-cam"" shots overused in TV commercials. Rather the films stark home-movie feel serves a real purpose fueling its disturbing sense of you-are-there reality. A few early scenes serve the students amateurish documentary as they -- still confident and lighthearted -- interview locals. But most footage reveals their harrowing ordeal as they become lost cold hungry and panicky in the woods. You could quibble that they wouldnt have used their cameras so much; we dont miss much. But Heather -- the obsessive leader -- has a compulsion to record things and in darkness the cameras provide illumination not just documentation. As Stephen King suggests in his latest novel The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon being lost in the wilderness is frightening enough. Most of the students tensions erupting arguments and emotional unraveling stem from that simple fact. But their woes soon multiply as they find strange menacing symbols hanging from trees and hear bizarre noises outside their tent at night. They realize theyre the quarry in a hideous hunt. Being lost isnt the worst of it. Their lives are on the line. Though set in the great outdoors The Blair Witch Project is almost suffocatingly claustrophobic. The students are trapped -- and so is the audience. As convincing and potent as it can be on these terms be warned that the film is far removed from todays cinema standards. For many Blair Witch will be a tough sell and the oversell its receiving does not serve it well. This is one horror flick with no graphic special effects or so-called ""money shots."" One computer-generated extra in a George Lucas picture would blow the entire budget for this movie. But you cant put a price on imagination and originality. Besides some of the best fright fests of recent decades have been similarly cheap yet effective from Night of the Living Dead in the 60s to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the 70s to The Evil Dead in the 80s. Blair Witchs harsh realism sets it apart and that realism owes less to convincing visuals than remarkably naturalistic performances from actors who improvised each line. Stars would have killed this concept. Instead unknown actors become the characters greatly enhancing our suspension of disbelief. Many movies try to transport us with dazzle but few have the convincing reality of Blair Witch. If you can handle its unconventional approach you wont feel as if youre seeing a film so much as witnessing a living nightmare.

Starring Heather Donahue Michael C. Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed and written by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. (R. 87 minutes. At the Bridge and Act One/Act Two in Berkeley.) Theres no denying the terror in ""The Blair Witch Project."" Its fierce its palpable and it gets deep under the skin in a way few movies do. Its also distinctly unpleasant. The thrills in this one-of-a-kind film which opens today after winning acclaim at the Sundance and Cannes film festivals arent the artificial kind we know from genre pieces such as ""Halloween"" or ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" -- but the raw soul-scraping horror of a nightmare. Co-directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez ""The Blair Witch Project"" is a pseudo- documentary about three student filmmakers who get lost in the Maryland woods. Hoping to explore the 200-year-old legend of the ""Blair Witch"" and the cult that surrounds it the film crew bickers gets lost and finally panics at the possibility of never getting out alive. The movie pretends that the ""filmmakers"" -- the overbearing ""director"" Heather Donahue laid-back ""cameraman"" Joshua Leonard and prickly ""sound recordist"" Michael C. Williams -- each disappeared in the woods. The footage in ""Blair Witch"" were told was discovered one year later. Thats a pretty cool concept for a film. In fact ""The Blair Witch Project"" is pure fiction and Donahue Leonard and Williams using their real names are actors who are still alive. But at least half of the appeal of the ""The Blair Witch Proj ect"" comes from wondering how they and the filmmakers were able to create such amazing authenticity onscreen. How did the actors none of whom came to the project with much film experience reach the primal off-the-chart emotional states that we see in the film? Is it just brilliantly good acting -- the kind that John Cassavetes drew from his actors -- or did Myrick and Sanchez scare the living hell out of them? In interviews and in press materials provided by the films distributor Myrick and Sanchez say they spent two days training the actors in the use of film and video cameras and set them loose in the forest with no script a modicum of food and only a rough set of situational guidelines. Whereas the tenderfoot characters they play are unable to read topographical maps -- and find themselves desperately walking in circles -- the actors in fact had Global Positioning System (GSP) handsets to find their way. The dialogue were told was all improvised and the camera work was all done by the actors. For better and for worse ""The Blair Witch Project"" has the grainy handheld look of a home movie or student project. Funkiness of that sort works here because it heightens the realism -- and replaces the filter of ""professionalism"" that typically insulates and protects us from true terror. It also becomes excruciatingly unpleasant for anyone including this critic who gets sick from watching too many handheld camera swoops and jerky pans. As with ""Breaking the Waves"" ""Celebration"" and Woody Allens ""Husbands and Wives"" ""The Blair Witch Project"" is certain to nauseate a portion of its audience. As an experiment in technique and simulated realism ""Blair Witch"" is enormously successful. Myrick and Sanchez pave new territory with their self-described ""method filmmaking"" and their actors Donahue in particular are incredi bly effective at yanking us into the desperate terror that their characters experience. After a while though ""The Blair Witch Project is neither fun nor exhilarating in that adrenaline-inducing way were accustomed to from horror movies. Its just dreadful and draining and for some of us literally sickening.

"Witch Project a Mock Doc That Really Can Shock - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie Review Witch Project a Mock Doc That Really Can ShockJuly 16 1999|KEVIN THOMAS | TIMES STAFF WRITER ""The Blair Witch Project"" has received so much advance press that you probably already know that it is a ""mockumentary"" thats received rave reviews on the festival circuit. And thats too bad since all that attention ultimately does a disservice to the audience.Those who go into the film cold are of course more likely to experience thrills and chills than those who know what theyre getting into--the second group however can expect an unsettling experience capped by a couple of jolts at the finish as the films twists and turns are impossible to predict and do generate low-key suspense. Some rave quotes suggest that youre in for a scare of ""Exorcist"" proportions whereas ""Blair Witch"" is essentially an exceedingly ingenious diversion.In short the film is a clever entertaining stunt no more no less and a terrific calling card for its fledgling filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez.An opening statement tells us that on Oct. 21 1994 Heather Donahue Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams hiked into Marylands Black Hills Forest to shoot a documentary on a local legend of the so-called Blair Witch a woman named Elly Kedward who was supposed to have caused half the youngsters of Blair village to vanish more than 200 years ago. In 1824 the town of Burkittsville was founded on the site of Blair; between November 1940 and May 1941 the town was rocked by the ritualistic slayings of seven children by a local hermit named Rustin Parr who after giving himself up tells authorities that he did it for ""an old woman ghost.""Once were informed that the student filmmakers disappeared without a trace but that we will be looking at the footage they shot--found a year later--we are abruptly thrust into the quickly menacing world of that footage. The filmmakers have taken tremendous pains to bring to it enough coherence so that we can be involved in the students plight as it unfolds yet maintain enough jaggedness so that ""Blair Projects"" fakery is utterly convincing.Leonard serves as cinematographer shooting in 16 millimeter while Williams is the projects sound man. In the meantime Heather records the groups growing rifts on High-8 video and her comments on those rifts; this is an unobtrusive and persuasive device that provides a crucial narrative flow in a completely natural way.Heather whose project it is comes off as headstrong and determined to maintain control of her shoot at all costs. Shes strong on using all the correct terms for the shoot-from-the-hip kind of documentary shes trying to make. Theres something highhanded a little condescending and insensitive about Heather as she goes about interviewing locals before she and her crew enter the forest where they quickly get lost and soon become subjected to a series of mysterious and malevolent incidents.The men become outraged at Heather for the predicament she got them into but all three young people are smart enough to know that if they are to have a hope of making it out of the forest theyve got to pull together.All three are playing roles although they use their actual names and the way in which Myrick and Sanchez make improvisation work within their outline keeping their cast in the dark and off balance as much as possible is nothing less than amazing. You can if you want buy into the possibility of supernatural forces acting as the prime mover or believe the trio has fallen victim to some unseen person or people who simply are in the grip of madness. Donahue Leonard and Williams are as absolutely believable as everything else about the film.If youre willing to look beyond the fright tactics in ""Blair Witch"" you can enjoy it as a kind of mordant commentary on the presumptuousness of brash and inexperienced documentary filmmakers who in this extreme instance plunge into a forest wilderness with woefully inadequate preparation and who actually think they will somehow be able to record supernatural manifestations on film. In the final analysis ""Blair Witch"" is perhaps more amusing and satisfying as a cautionary tale deflating a certain kind of filmmaking arrogance than it is as an offbeat horror show.

Heather (Heather Donahue) the director is bossy and bullheaded; Josh (Joshua Leonard) the cinematographer is slouchy and laconic; Mike (Michael Williams) the soundman is the joker with the pop-cultural quips. (All three are templates for interns at EW -- the kind of pups who will mark my words one day be running this magazine.) The filmmakers are never heard from again. Great setup. The clever premise of the indie chiller The Blair Witch Project (which what with the high-altitude setting and midnight scheduling scared the snow boots off a lot of Sundance festival attendees last January but is not nearly so terrifying at sea level) is that what we are seeing is footage from the doomed project discovered a year after the college kids vanished. Were peeking in effect into a diary that is all the more harrowing as a last will and testament We brace for a shriek- inducing climax Heather Josh and Mike couldnt anticipate. And we watch with pleasurable mounting anxiety as camaraderie crumbles into paranoia panic overtakes camera technique and fear explodes into the kind of hysteria the girls of Salem must have known back in the 17th century. Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez the young filmmakers who conceived this Project are canny about any number of horror conventions not least of which is that Scream and its descendants have used up irony as a sustainable attitude. They know too that our own sophistication about special effects has deadened the potency of on-screen gore. Today when moviegoers know everything about everything (and can never unimagine say that Alien monster bursting from John Hurts chest) the only true fear lies in whats not shown. (Hitchcock understood this better than anyone.) But Myrick Sanchez and their fellow producers are also ahead of the pack in making effective use of the Internet for its promotional and paranoia-inducing properties. As Blairies swap theories and fears online they also (ideally) generate box office interest and frighten each other silly with even more intricate horror scenarios passed around among a community of website strangers. In the end -- not that this will spoil anything -- The Blair Witch Project leaves more questions than it answers. Including What happened? As a horror picture it may not be much more than a cheeky game a novelty with the cool blurry look of an avant-garde artifact. But as a manifestation of multimedia synergy its pretty spooky.

"The Blair Witch Project (R) Related Items Go to Video Finder Transcript from a live talk with the directors ""Blair Witchs"" dizzy spell Simple Yet Effective Witch Hunt By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 16 1999 Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick direct the thriller. (Artisan) Director Daniel Myrick; Eduardo Sanchez Cast Heather Donahue; Michael Williams; Joshua Leonard Running Time 1 hour 28 minutes Contains macabre material and strong language The big question hanging over ""The Blair Witch Project"" is simple but devastatingly effective. What happened to the three friends Heather Donahue Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams who dove deep into the Maryland woods in search of witches and never returned? The date was Oct. 21 1994 according to the opening titles. Its always creepier with a date isnt it? You can almost hear Robert Stacks voice in the narration as the titles also inform us ""One year later their footage was found."" The trio in the movie - led by Donahue (and portraying themselves) - was trying to make a documentary about the Blair Witch a spirit believed to be haunting this sparsely inhabited corner of Marylands Black Hills Forest. But all that remains of their five-day trek into the heart of darkness is the footage in Leonards 16mm camera and Donahues High-8 video. Which we get to watch. Well what happened? You wont find out by reading this. But I will say ""Blair"" was a good college try of a flick - as good an effort as one could expect of a film with no budget one pretty good idea and a few creative minds trying to come up with an MTV-age campfire movie. Imagine a collaboration between George ""Night of the Living Dead"" Romero and the makers of ""The Real World."" Donahue is the director of this witch-finding documentary a young idealistic person with a fairly good idea of the history behind the Blair Witch. Too bad shes not too hot with scouting skills. Before embarking into the woods Donahue and crew interview the locals who have heard a story or two about that Witch Up There. Thats another essential ingredient in a horror flick - the creepy past that preceded all this. Good stuff With these veiled anecdotal warnings the film crew - young ambitious and dude-like - heads straight for the heart of darkness. Or Maryland anyway. Although they have a map and compass they become hopelessly lost. As they realize how unmoored they are their initial good humor becomes fraught with anxiety tears disbelief boredom depression and occasional yelling. Was that the same log bridge across the creek they saw hours earlier? Do they go south or east now? What are those noises outside their tents at night? What happened to the smokes? As they become increasingly frayed and freaked we start preparing for the worst. And thats where Im leaving it. ""The Blair Witch Project"" is certainly assured and savvy enough for the government work that we romantically refer to as ""American Independent Moviemaking."" I was hooked on its creepy possibilities right through to the end. Whats good about this film is the way its actual creators - Ed Sanchez Dan Myrick and Gregg Hale - use ellipses and suggestion to make our minds do most of the work. Most of the time its what the three witch-searchers dont see - but fear - that gets our petrified juices flowing or curdling. This is low-tech inventiveness at its best. And that surely is what campfire storytelling is all about.

"Blair Witch Project The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blair-witch-project-the ) Blair Witch Project The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli ""In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found."" With this ominous pronouncement on a title card The Blair Witch Project begins. Its an effective and startling hook to open a film and the product that follows delivers on the promise of this unusual premise. The Blair Witch Project caused a major stir with Sundance and for good reason - it was perhaps the most offbeat energetic and eye-opening motion picture to screen there. Word-of-mouth was so strong that a special screening had to be scheduled in the 1300-seat Eccles theater and it was packed. Recent years have seen a dramatic upturn in the number of so-called ""meta-documentaries"" (or ""mockumentaries"") real-seeming fakes in the mold of Orson Welles infamous ""War of the Worlds"" radio play. Titles like Dadetown Unmade Beds Forgotten Silver and 20 Dates have toyed with the line between fiction and reality in often interesting ways. And while The Blair Witch Project belongs in the same loosely defined category its another kind of film altogether. Its a horror movie that lives up to its name and does so with only one brief scene of mild gore. The Blair Witch Project is in a word brilliant - and is even more impressive considering that its the debut effort from filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez and Daniel Myrick. (Some will argue that something this experimental and unusual would not have come from an established director and theres ample evidence to back up such a statement.) Watching this film is a harrowing experience because we accept the characters as completely real and become engaged in their ordeal. In one corner of my mind I knew this was all fictional but the verisimilitude is impressive and results in an experience that is as fascinating as it is involving and creepy. The Blair Witch Project is presented as a documentary within a documentary. Aspiring director Heather Donahue a film student at Montgomery College has decided to chronicle the legend of the supposed ""Blair Witch"" - a mythical figure that has supposedly haunted Marylands Black Hills Forest since the late 18th century and is credited for numerous heinous murders. Accompanying Heather are camera man Joshua Leonard and sound operator Michael Williams. In addition to making a 16 mm black-and-white film Heather is capturing virtually everything on High 8 video with the intention of assembling a behind-the-scenes look at how her movie ""The Blair Witch Project"" was made. The first images we see are of a group of seemingly normal college students getting ready for a few days in the woods. They mug for the camera crack jokes and go food shopping. Next they proceed to a cemetery where they film the opening scene - a monologue by Heather recounting part of the legend. From there they travel to the town of Burkittsville to interview several residents about the Blair Witch including one who claims to have seen the apparition. After that they enter the forest tracking the legend. They become lost and are never seen again but their surviving video and film footage tells of their nerve-wracking and horrifying experiences with the supernatural and of the tension that grows among them as they blame each other for their predicament. The element that makes The Blair Witch Project unusually compelling is the atypical manner in which it is presented. Every scene is a point-of-view shot shown exactly as one might expect from someone carrying around a video camera. The transitions are unexpected and often jarring - the kind of thing that would result from turning the camera off at one point then turning it back on later. Some of the most chilling sequences occur at night when the darkness foils the video. There are instances when the screen is black and all we have to rely on is the audio - the near-panicked voices of the protagonists in the foreground and strange unearthly noises in the background. At other times the action depicted is chaotic and difficult to piece together often because the person doing the filming is running or unsure what to capture. Its not hard to understand why these segments work so well - they rely on the imagination to fill in the pictures and what our minds conjure up is always more horrifying than anything the filmmakers can put on screen (even with todays special effects technology). Also this seemingly haphazard and ""unprofessional"" approach gives the audience a ""you are there"" feeling that draws them into the experience making everything that transpires more shocking and immediate that it would seem in a conventional format. The trio of actors - Heather Donahue Michael Williams and Joshua Leonard (they use their real names) - arent merely good theyre excellent. Their performances are perfect - no one shows a hint of artifice or fakery. Their conversations and emotions feel right for the changing circumstances and they dont talk as if their lines have been scripted. (In fact much of The Blair Witch Project was done using improvisation - an approach that contributes to its believability.) It doesnt take long for us to develop a bond with these characters even though we know they arent going to make it. And one of the final scenes with Heather offering a tearful apology to her mother is heartbreaking. One could argue that the pacing is erratic but while there are times when events progress slowly (I admit to checking my watch once) its necessary to the films desire to present vivid characters and unravel events slowly. The supernatural is only one element of The Blair Witch Projects suspense - the other involves the psychological deterioration of the characters as circumstances become increasingly desperate and they cant find their way out of the woods. Directors Sanchez and Myrick are constantly ratcheting up the level of tension - sometimes to an almost unbearable state. For those who like to nitpick the movie does have a few (minor) contrivances. Even though events are set in 1994 its still odd that a group of three people going deep into the woods would not have a cell phone with them. Granted portable phones werent as omnipresent in 1994 as they are today but they were still reasonably common. (It would have been more believable for the trio to have had one but for it not to have worked since cellular technology is notoriously capricious in sparsely populated areas.) Also the cameras are on until the very end - if I had been the characters position I wouldnt have bothered with a video record once I realized my life was in danger. But these are petty comments and Im sure the filmmakers have answers for them. In fact a great deal of time and effort has gone into developing a backstory for The Blair Witch Project. The website ( http//www.blairwitch.com/) presents the events of the film as real occurrences and includes bios of the characters a history of the Blair Witch news clips about the disappearances interviews with relatives excerpts from Heathers journal and information about the police investigation (which was supposedly abandoned in 1997 when the case was declared ""inactive and unsolved""). It is likely that anyone going to this film without being aware that its a work of fiction will emerge from the theater convinced that what they witnessed is real. No horror film before or since can make such a lofty claim. Sanchez and Myrick deserve credit not only for attempting something different but for succeeding so brilliantly at it. Their work speaks volumes for both their talent and their future potential. The fact that a recent movie The Last Broadcast used a similar storyline and approach but failed miserably as both an artistic expression and a form of entertainment is evidence of Sanchez and Myricks ability. For now they can enjoy the way their production has become an international phenomenon and audiences can look forward to a unique and genuinely terrifying motion picture experience. One piece of advice do not see this film if you intend to go on an overnight hiking/camping trip in the near future. This is the kind of movie that will stay with you and once the sun has set and the critters in the underbrush start to make noise images from The Blair Witch Project will leap to mind and the tranquility of the woods will turn ominous.

"The Blair Witch Project Movie review of The Blair Witch Project by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Movie review The Blair Witch Project -- 4 out of 5 stars Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The simplest effects are the most effective ""effects."" Thats the horrific lesson of micro-budget masterpiece of modern horror The Blair Witch Project.The camera that three would-be filmmakers use on this camping trip/location shoot shakes. The cinematographer adequately keeps most of who and what he needs to in the frame. But Spielbergs not scouting him for the next big Hollywood epic. That clumsiness makes it ""real"" or seem that way. Getting lost. Its primal. It makes us revert to childhood. And given the circumstances here it breeds panic.Bratty and then unstable behavior from people you dont know but whom youve chosen to wander into the woods and camp with. Tiny stick figures pieced together out of twigs every fresh one betraying that someone or something is stalking these woodland virgins.A flashlight in a tent in a darker-than-dark forest.A tough-minded and ambitious college girl holding a camcorder to her face plainly scared witless.Snippets of a chilling ""legend"" discussed repeated and then remembered for a finale that still raises the hair on the back of my neck 10 years after The Blair Witch Project came out. Its a movie version of a million scary campfire tales a movie Americans have been conditioned almost since birth to shrink from. The college kids ( Heather Donahue Joshua Leonard Michael C. Williams) want to make a documentary about this local ( Maryland) witch legend. Kids have been disappearing in those woods for decades.That would make a great movie right? They pack tents lights and cameras but no woodlands skills and trek off into the forest only to disappear -- with only shaky film and video that theyve recorded surviving them.But theres a subversive subtext to The Blair Witch Project one that the years have if anything reinforced. Its a generational joke an object lesson in the follies of film school and one of the great gullibility tests of our time.Who could believe this was ""real?"" The answer is right there on the screen -- young people who grew up with cable the Internet and cell phones a coddled media-and-tech savvy generation that wants fame and sees film school as a means of attaining it but is utterly inept at survival basics once theyve severed their electronic tether. Time and again they face fear and danger that they can only appreciate by seeing through a viewfinder. Reality? Not unless I can TiVo it.So enjoy the frights the darkness the perfectly-timed bumps in the night. And try to pretend you werent one of those who fell for the cunning ""This really happened"" hype that the movie-makers (co-directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez with Michael Monello Gregg Hale and Robin Cowie design by Ben Rock cinematography by Neal Fredericks) used to make The Blair Witch Project a horror hit and a cultural phenomenon for the ages.The Blair Witch Project Four of five starsCast Heather Donahue Joshua Leonard Michael C.

An intensely imaginative piece of conceptual filmmaking that also delivers the goods as a dread-drenched horror movie ""The Blair Witch Project"" puts a clever modern twist on the universal fear of the dark and things that go bump in the night. Snapped up by Artisan at the start of the Sundance fest this resourceful ultra-low-budgeter is probably too raw and lacking in the clockwork visceral jolts to go over with the general horror audience but its effective enough that with smart handling it should be able to move beyond simple cult status. The way the film was made has everything to do with how it plays out onscreen. An opening title card informs that in October 1994 three young filmmakers hiked into the Black Hills Forest in Maryland to shoot a docu about the legend of the Blair Witch. The filmmakers were never heard from again but a year later their footage was found an edited version of which constitutes the present feature. This information of course puts a chill into the viewer from the outset since it guarantees that things did not turn out well. Writer-director-editors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez heightened the projects verisimilitude by training their three actors to use cameras then sent them out into the forest for eight days to shoot the picture themselves; certain destination points and encounters were established in advance and notes to the thesps were left in baskets along the way. Otherwise they were on their own and improvised their way through a rigorous shoot without a clue as to how and when things were going to wind up. All the visuals therefore are either hand-held often jittery color video images taken by the bossy director and project organizer Heather or black-and-white 16mm shots lensed by the troupes tyro cameraman the hippie-ish Joshua; regular guy Michael is along to record sound. What they really could have used was a navigator. Expedition starts out with an expected optimism and Heather interviews locals about the Blair Witch legend which involves numerous mysterious disappearances and evidence of gruesome torture many years ago. Once into the forest which is beginning to become brown and wet with the onset of autumn Heather attempts to keep everyones spirits up despite the long daily slogs with heavy backpacks (""Well all look back on this and laugh heartily"" she interjects when the boys rightly become apprehensive that shes gotten them lost) but terror sets in on the second night when they hear what sounds like people circling their tent and stepping on twigs and branches nearby. Thus begins an awful succession of days taken up with endless walking and periods of willed level-headedness broken by fear-driven yelling and recriminations about how they ever got into this mess. Unable to find their way back to civilization the trio is forced to set up camp every evening and just as they fear they will the bone-chilling noises continue; in the mornings they emerge to find little rock piles and twig bundles that prove someone was there. As Heather says ""Im scared to close my eyes Im scared to open them."" Needless to say nothing good comes of all this and the vise is effectively tightened not only by the increasingly perilous situation in which the threesome find themselves but also by the filmmaking technique the continuous point-of-view shots and at night the highly concentrated lighting keep the viewers range of vision extremely limited creating a highly claustrophobic feeling and great apprehension over what might suddenly pop into frame. Without giving anything important away the climax which takes place in an ramshackle old house is both intense and ambiguous and will prompt significant debate even among the films fans. Pic comes across as smart without feeling manipulative except in isolated moments and serves as a reminder that effective horror stems much more from psychology than from graphic gore. All the same the film builds up a sense of horrific expectation that it cant quite match in its payoff. Thesps are uniformly naturalistic and palpably show the effects of little sleep and reduced rations as the eight-day nightmare wears on.

"`Blair Witch Packs Enough Power To Scare - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Movies.`Blair Witch Packs Enough Power To ScareJuly 16 1999|By Mark Caro Tribune Movie Writer.Aside from giving many moviegoers a happy case of the creeps ""The Blair Witch Project"" is likely to inspire a generation of aspiring filmmakers to slap their heads and wonder why they hadnt thought of such a brilliant deceptively simple idea first.Most movies filling the multiplexes are driven by a single easy-to-market concept like a wacky TV show remake or overhyped sequel or Adam Sandler-and-a-kid comedy. What these films have in common is that they cost tens of millions of dollars to make and may leave you embarrassed for having plunked down 8.50.Then theres ""The Blair Witch Project"" which was made for the price of operating a Hi-8 video recorder a 16 mm black-and-white camera a DAT sound recorder plus costs for camping supplies food hiring a small cast of unknown actors and other expenses. The movie boasts no computer graphics no fancy camerawork (intentional at least) and just one glimpse of blood yet the makers of would-be blockbusters only wish they could come up with a concept that grabs you as originally and effectively as ""Blair Witch.""The opening on-screen title notes that in October 1994 three student filmmakers entered the Maryland woods to shoot a documentary and were never heard from again -- until their footage was found a year later. What follows is 87 minutes of that supposed footage as Heather Donahue (the documentarys director and behind-the-scenes video shooter) Joshua Leonard (the 16 mm cameraman) and Michael Williams (the sound guy) record their happy-go-lucky preparations for their adventure interviews with locals about the witch myth and the trios increasingly tense trek into the woods.Many movies or TV shows create the impression that youre seeing what wasnt meant to be seen putting you in the position of eavesdropper or peeping Tom. Often as with ""8mm"" or even ""The Jerry Springer Show"" you just feel cheap or guilty. ""Blair Witch"" in contrast uses the heightened immediacy of its home-movies-like format for a higher purpose to make us care about the people on screen and then to scare us when they are in peril.Recent horror-movie characters are so notoriously flat that the ""Scream"" movies have become the most successful slasher franchise just by parodying their predictable behavior and the genres cliches. One of the startling aspects of ""Blair Witch"" is that it lets you get acquainted -- even intimate -- with people who seem completely genuine.Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez directed edited and wrote what there was to write in the movie including the whole convoluted myth that hangs over the woods like a foul mist. But instead of supplying dialogue they cast especially natural actors put them in ominous situations and let them improvise their interactions while they film one another.The work of Donahue Leonard and Williams shouldnt be underrated. Although theyre playing characters that share their own names each makes a distinct impression Heather the flippant bossy leader whose ultimate into-the-camera apology is as stirring and emotionally raw as any fright film moment youre likely to see; the earthy Josh who cant always maintain his Zen cool; and Mike the trios newcomer and wildcard.Theyre funny -- such as when Heather probes the softness of marshmallows with her camera or observes Mikes irregular chest-hair patterns -- as well as occasionally annoying. But even when their bickering gets shrill they remain wholly believable and the honesty of their reactions is what sells the movies horror aspects.Like expert around-the-campfire storytellers Myrick and Sanchez rely upon the power of suggestion to create an atmosphere of dread. Because the subjects operate their own cameras ""Blair Witch"" essentially is a first-person horror film; you dont see anything before they do and theyre not reacting quickly enough to discover the source of whats spooking them. What they come across may not be inherently scary; were talking about piles of rocks stickmen hanging from trees some slime. Yet the mysterious findings arrive at dramatic moments appearing all the more evocative in the contrasting black-and-white film and color video.What becomes especially impressive about ""Blair Witch"" is how relentlessly it sticks to its vision. As the students become progressively lost and freaked out Myrick Sanchez and the actors have the good sense to keep building the tension instead of breaking it with clever twists or dumb jokes; at no point are the students startled by rustling that turns out be a cute little squirrel.Ive seen this movie twice now and both times the ending was followed by dead silence in the audience. Many of us may have thought that with the world offering so much vivid horribleness every day movies had lost the power to give us a good cathartic scare. Its a shock -- and a pleasure -- to discover we were wrong.``THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT(star) (star) (star) (star)Written directed and edited by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez; photography directed by Neal Fredericks; production designed by Ben Rock; music by Tony Cora; produced by Gregg Hale Robin Cowie.

Written directed and edited by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez. Running time 87 minutes. Rating R. At Angelika Film Center 18 W. Houston St. at Mercer Street. DESPITE the absence of scary music sudden jolts and flashing knives ""The Blair Witch Project"" may be the creepiest and most original horror film since John Carpenters classic ""Halloween."" In a brilliant and original update of a traditional horror device the ""found"" diary - its the form Bram Stoker used when he wrote ""Dracula"" - the movie purports to be an edited version of film and tape recordings discovered in the Maryland woods after a documentary team disappeared there in 1994. The team is led by Heather Donahue (played by an actress named Heather Donahue) who is making a documentary about the 200-year-old legend of the Blair witch for a college project. Shes also narrating and keeping a videotape record of the filming on her camcorder. The filming is being done by Joshua Donahue who operates the black-and-white 16mm camera and Michael Williams the sound man. Through the footage shot on her camcorder we see the trio load up drive to Burkittsville Md. and talk to the locals. They film one interview with a mad old lady who claims to have seen the Blair witch in the form of a fur-covered woman and then another one with two fisherman who direct the filmmakers to a logging trail that leads to an old murder site known as Coffin Rock. Then they drive up to the woods park the car and hike into the interior with the equipment on their backs. The first night passes quietly enough. But during the day they see strange piles of rocks like grave markers. The second night they hear strange noises and in the morning they come upon bundles of twigs tied together to resemble a human being with arms outstretched. And then they get lost. The recordings account for three more days and nights as hunger exhaustion and fear take their toll. The woods arent even particularly dark or creepy ones. But as the three kids run out of food water and confidence the forest seems ever more hostile and alien. You never see who or what is harassing and finally attacking them. But very cleverly you see the way the group loses its cohesion thanks to teen-age acting- out and the onset of panic. There isnt a single moment when the footage dialogue and group dynamics dont ring true. The actors look and act just like real people and the tension builds up slowly - just like it does in real life. And because you see everything through the characters eyes - in particular those of the redoubtable tough-talking Heather - the whole nightmare is that much more intense. For some people ""The Blair Witch Project"" could do for overnight hiking what ""Jaws"" did for midnight skinny-dipping. For others it may just be a strong argument for making use of the right to bear arms.
