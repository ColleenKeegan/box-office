Ten years after witnessing the brutal murder of his wife and daughter Clyde Shelton (Butler) repays the two killers responsible one dies screaming after Clyde rigs the lethal injection the other meets a torturous end that is videotaped and sent to Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) an ambitious assistant DA who a decade before negotiated an expedient plea bargain for the second killer. But when Clyde is arrested he declares war on the city of Philadelphia and its political and legal institutions. Im gonna bring the whole fuckin diseased corrupt temple down on your head he tells Rice. And he does despite being behind bars. Director F Gary Grays remake of The Italian Job was a solid effort as was writer Kurt Wimmers reworking of The Thomas Crown Affair. Sadly theres nothing here but bloody off-cuts from Death Wish Saw and The Silence of the Lambs in roughly that order.

Clydes a first hand witness and theres enough bad guy DNA around his house to bake a pie - naturally Clyde has a major concern with a justice system that fails to deal out two death sentences. He waits and plans for 10 years to correct the justice system in his own way. His methods are awful to behold and not for the squeamish - clever plotting and a great movie.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 11 2009Billy-JFeaturedI was looking forward to seeing this film being a fan of action films and seeing this one as an action film with a slightly original idea (a rarity nowadays Im sure youll agree). However when push came to shove everything didnt work its attempts to be a deep study of the American justice system fall flat because the man who is supposedly righteous cuts a man into 25 separate pieces The explanation of how he actually was able to carry out his master plan made me want to laugh and threw up so many plot holes that it began to resemble some kind of minefield. I can cope with some plot holes (I can pick apart some of my favourite films of all time) but this was way too much and when you couple that with pointless scenes (Butler stripping naked to be arrested could be the most pointless Ive seen in a long time if i wanted to see a naked bum Id watch Time Cop) then it all adds up to a film that has nothing to redeem it no likable characters and its one hook turning out to be perhaps its biggest flaw. In fact the only bit I did like was when Butler SPOILER was killed at the end END SPOILER the only time in my opinion when justice was truly done. At the end of the day when it comes to LAC the question I ask is can you ever sympathise with a brutal psychopathic killer? Me personally no.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyDec 10 2009cass_isFeaturedGreat movie. I havent seen an entire cinema room so full and so quiet at a movie for a long time. Nobody was blinking.

That the system ultimately fails (Foxx hitting Butler and Butlers eventual predictable demise) was I thought the most interesting aspect of the movie. This polemical aspect lifts it above most thriller-shockers and I think taps into a deep frustration among the population at large against our legal and political institutions.

Only downside perhaps was the ending which didnt fully satisfy me or ring true with the rest of the movie. It was a lazy cop-out after everything that had happened before. That said I like darker endings to my movies anyway and from the start I was on Butlers side after-all Butlers character was the real victim.

Law Abiding Citizen Bad Director F. Gary Gray. Cast Jamie Foxx Gerard Butler Bruce McGill. Rating R for strong bloody and brutal violence and torture a scene of rape and pervasive language. Related Director Gray returns with Law Abiding Citizen Revenge movies Spotlight Gerard Butler Spotlight Jamie Foxx As a movie its a ridiculous execution of a misguided concept. So theres that. But it does have a couple of things going for it Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler. Two lesser actors and the thing would be practically unwatchable. With them its a revenge fantasy in which were not sure whom to pull for; instead we just root for the movie to end. Clyde Shelton (Butler) is an inventor who is tinkering around one night when men break into his Philadelphia home beat him and kill his family. The killers are caught but Nick Rice (Foxx) an assistant district attorney cuts a plea bargain to get one to testify against the other. Years pass. The execution of one killer goes horrifically wrong; soon the other suspect turns up dead. Shelton is arrested and although he lets Rice know hes responsible he does so in such a way that wont quite allow Rice to convict him. The guy has been doing his homework. Shelton further maneuvers the justice system that has so let him down to get himself placed in solitary confinement. For the audience this means a lot of shots of a brooding Butler leaving the actor with little else to do but appear to be thinking. Or scheming. Or something. But just because hes behind bars doesnt mean Shelton cant continue his campaign against the system. Much to Rices consternation he is somehow able to bring a reign of terror down on the city; Rice is powerless to stop him. So as Rice and his co-works race to figure out how Shelton is manipulating events from behind bars - theres clearly more to the guy than previously thought - the body count piles up. Which poses a problem for the audience. When Shelton is getting revenge on the people who killed his family its possible to understand Sheltons motives. Even Rice acknowledges as much. But when Shelton goes after people he perceives as being compromised or corrupted (or both) hes less easy to sympathize with. Yes the system is imperfect and yes thats frustrating. But grounds for the murder of those who work within it? Thats what siding with Shelton means. Or do we side with Rice who represents to Shelton (and to us) the system with its strengths but also its weaknesses? Its to Butler and Foxxs credit that we care enough to even ask the question. Even then its hard to care all that much. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

"Movie Review Law Abiding Citizen Another Ugly Revenge Fantasy Film washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movie Review Law Abiding Citizen Another Ugly Revenge Fantasy Film Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Dan Kois Special to The Washington Post Friday October 16 2009; 410 PM A preposterous exercise in high-minded brutality ""Law Abiding Citizen"" tries to pass itself off as a dialectic on justice betrayed but instead plays like a snuff film with our nations legal system as the victim. It begins with a brutal rape and double murder by baseball bat-wielding thugs. Ten years later (in the movie although you may also feel that much time has passed in the theater) Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) the man whose wife and daughter were slain exacts revenge on the paroled killer his accomplice and every government official in the city of Philadelphia. ""Now they get to watch you suffer"" a saw-wielding Clyde growls to a terrified strapped-down criminal Darby (Christian Stolte) pointing to a photo of his dead family. Thats the defining characteristic of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" It wants to watch people suffer. The deaths in ""Law Abiding Citizen"" are designed for a target audience that wants to see bad guys get theirs as horribly as possible. A movie devoted to baroque revenge would be on its own terms acceptable; what makes ""Law Abiding Citizen"" so risible is its humorless conviction that its got Big Ideas at its core. Director F. Gary Gray seems convinced hes making something profound; among his misguided auteurist decisions is one particularly pointless juxtaposition of a gruesomely botched lethal injection with a childs cello recital. And in scene after tedious scene Clyde and Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) the district attorney who let a killer plea-bargain his way off Death Row debate justice and fate in a grandiose interrogation cage under high vaulted ceilings. For Clyde doesnt just want revenge oh no. He plans to bring the justice system to its knees and targets the judge attorneys and even the poor office assistants who failed him 10 years before. Fortuitously Clyde used to work as a remote-target assassin for a government black-ops outfit so even as he sits in prison its childs play for him to pick off the residents of the Philly courthouse one by one using exploding cellphones and remote-controlled rocket launchers. Audiences turned off by the vitriolic tone of recent anti-government sentiment might find the release of a film about the systematic assassination of government officials in questionable taste. One day some director will make a great movie about the failures of the American justice system but Im pretty sure that movie wont include the line ""Feel that? Its a rare poison isolated from the liver of a Caribbean puffer fish."" Foxx is fine in ""Law Abiding Citizen."" You know he jabbers he preens he threatens Clyde with cold eyes he grins he does his Jamie Foxx thing. Butler gives his all as the victim-turned-tormenter but his wide eyes and stubble do most of his acting for him. Blink and youll miss poor Viola Davis one of the great actors of her generation as Phillys tough-talking mayor. Its a threat to that mayor and to the citys top officials that Nick must avert in the films climax. But future screenwriters of thrillers take heed Few scenes carry less dramatic weight than an e-mail ex machina. Law Abiding Citizen (108 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for bloody brutal violence and torture; a scene of rape and pervasive language.

(Overture Films) Joe Neumaier Thursday October 15 2009 1144 PM Title Law Abiding Citizen ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is such a lazy action-drama underachiever it seems unfair to target stars Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler for bringing their C game. The two actors cat-and-mouse play is supposed to be the guts of director F. Gary Grays thriller yet that angle is as underdeveloped as the films boneheaded notion of justice. Foxx - mostly acting here with his stern jaw - is Philadelphia Assistant District Attorney Nick Rice who makes deals with defendants to keep his conviction rate high. The latest aces on his docket are two dirt bags who murdered the wife and child of Clyde Shelton (Butler). The one who actually held the knife rats on his pal which to Clydes shock earns him an eligible-for-parole third-degree-murder charge instead of the death sentence the accomplice receives. Flash-forward 10 years. Nick now a father himself and No. 2 in the DAs office is watching the Shelton killers execution when what should be a quick lethal injection becomes a horror show. After the perp who walked free is found dismembered shortly afterward the obvious suspect is Clyde who proceeds to do what anyone would when the cops arrive strip naked and stand in front of the door. Cue audience eye-roll. Once in prison Clyde gets his kicks by making his own ""deals"" with Nick - a new bed will save the life of a lawyer; a tasty lunch will save a judge - though the way hes pulling this off isnt known. As the movie devolves into simply figuring out how Clyde orchestrates events from his solitary confinement (hint Hes not just the ""tinkerer"" one character describes him as) ""Law Abiding Citizen"" just chases its own tail for an hour. Butler now as ever a poor mans Russell Crowe gives up the grieving-survivor bit quickly. Instead he decides to play Clyde as the grinning calculating fiend behind bars like Hannibal Lecter without taste. Foxx is more of a disappointment. After his Best Actor Oscar for ""Ray"" there have been years worth of lesser work (""Jarhead"" ""Miami Vice"" ""The Kingdom"" ""The Soloist""). Despite handling both the Harrison Ford-ish lines (""Stay away from my family"") and the glibness with gusto Foxx is as precision-timed as one of Clydes clockwork bombs. Theres never actually any need for Clyde to be in prison while committing his dirty deeds (and the way he spent the last decade once revealed is more OCD than M-A-D). Its a ridiculous contrivance thats here mainly so not one person but two can deliver the punch-line twist. But by the time it comes the movie feels completely punch-drunk.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Oct. 15 2009 240PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Law Abiding Citizen Directed by F. Gary Gray Written by Kurt Wimmer Starring Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler Classification 14A Gauging the shifting winds of fear and prejudice the vigilante flick is often a good barometer of the social climate. Its popular at times when electioneering pols aided by the eager media are raising alarms about crime and punishment insisting that the system has grown lax in its zeal to corral the wicked and guarantee our security. For example the TV series Dexter tapped neatly into the temper of the Bush era featuring a nice-guy serial killer who only tortures and slaughters those who profoundly deserve their fate. By contrast LawAbiding Citizen smells a bit musty these days. Indeed in an era when the debate has shifted from too little state vigilance to too damn much this thing seems almost quaint. Make that crimsonly quaint since the pre-credit violence sets the premise in bloody close-up. Two thugs invade the house of good citizen Clyde (Gerard Butler) a loving husband and father who finds himself stabbed his wife raped and his young daughter assaulted. Only he survives the ordeal and soon faces a further horror. The killers are caught and brought to a Philadelphia courtroom by Nick the district attorney (Jamie Foxx) who negotiates a plea bargain The thug-in-chief - a tattooed uber-villain of giant girth and dubious hygiene - receives a reduced sentence in return for testifying against his accomplice ensuring him the death penalty. The consequence Nick gets his convictions. Clyde gets angry. And eventually gets even. Cut to 10 years later. Released the big thug is enjoying his freedom with the usual blowsy tart. Re-enter our vigilante Clyde who in the first of many elaborately plotted escapades tracks down the baddie and with Dexter-like precision subjects him to a slow death by skill saw. Generously director F. Gary Gray treats us to the results of this carpentry - all 25 fleshy pieces some bearing rudely interrupted tattoos. But the anti-hero has just begun a fact that can be safely gleaned from his enthusiastic assertion that ""Im gonna bring the whole diseased corrupt temple down. Its gonna be biblical."" Of course the temple in question is the judicial system - judges defence lawyers and primarily Nick the deal-making prosecutor. As it happens Nick is also a loving husband with his own sweet young daughter thereby encouraging us to draw parallels between the compromising law enforcer and the erstwhile law abider. Such parallels are meant to give the film depth and for a millimetre or two they do. From there getting biblical seems to involve getting technical as the deadly plotting grows ever more elaborate - its sheer wonkiness is almost fun to watch. These lethal intricacies are possible because Clyde isnt any mere Everyman; conveniently it turns out he boasts a resume especially well-suited to his new gig as the instrument of righteous vengeance. This strikes me as narrative cheating but you may play the critical game by more relaxed rules. Anyway death by skill saw soon gives way to a colourful assortment of termination ploys ranging from the crude (death by plastic fork) to the trite (death by car bomb). My favourite although honesty demands an admission of bias in this matter is death by cellphone. Now theres a vigilante I can definitely get behind - finally justice is served.

At last the missing link be tween ""Phantom of the Opera"" and ""Saw."" Welcome to the gonzo revenge saga ""Law Abiding Citizen."" As he did in the movie version of ""Phantom"" Gerard Butler once again gets his underground lair on staging a rococo series of murders in the name of vengeance for his wifes two killers -- one of whom got a three-year sentence in exchange for ratting out the other one. Jamie Foxx -- who went from little star to big star to little star in less than five years -- essentially plays the straight man in this unintentional comedy routine a flummoxed Philadelphia assistant DA named Nick. Nicks only function is to growl and be outsmarted as evil genius Clyde (Butler) despite being locked up in prison continues to arrange remote-controlled mayhem for everyone in the justice system. This includes lots of people who had nothing to do with the light sentencing of the guy who killed Clydes family. Clyde is peeved at Nick for arranging the original plea bargain but becoming a rampaging psychopath seems excessive. Nicks plea deal got one killer executed. (Hurrah for that -- only three people have been executed in the 31 years since the Quaker State reinstated capital punishment.) The other guy was dumped out on the street where Clyde could make him his special guest at a ""Saw""-style torture party. The movie should be over in 20 minutes since this miscreant is the only guy with whom Clyde really has a beef. Why does a Deep Throat character pop up so briefly to explain who Clyde is and how he thinks only to check out of the movie? Youd think Nick might be interested to hear more from this guy especially as he burrows into Nicks complicated financial records. By the way would a DA really spend hours looking into Panamanian sub-corporations when people are getting blown to bits all over Philly? True most of them are probably Eagles fans so no great loss. Still youd think Nick would be spending a bit more time tracking the mystery accomplice outside Clydes prison. Directed by F. Gary Gray (""The Italian Job"") the movie at least revels in the preposterous -- a daring rather than boring variety of awfulness -- and keeps the howlers coming. My favorite scenes include the one where we learn that Clyde has become an expert on criminal law (close-up on a volume found in his office -- about federal bankruptcy code as if this will provide loopholes for a killin frenzy). Then theres the one where witnessing an execution is described as ""like watching somebody fall asleep -- except for the not waking up part;"" the time Clyde specifically requests a steak from Del Friscos only to do evil things with it (nice product plug fellas the Steakhouse of Psychos); and Nicks refusal to negotiate side dishes ""F- - - you and your pommes frites"" Looking for logic in this picture is like looking for sexy pictures in the Lands End winter catalog. So elaborate is the series of booby traps so extravagant the secret chambers so precisely timed the gizmos and so feverish Clydes vows to terrorize his way to justice that I kept waiting for the giant chandelier to crash on Foxxs head. If only Clyde and Nick could solve their dispute with show tunes. Just one big sweeping ballad fellas Thats all I ask of you. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Comedian End world hunger?

""I think thats the cheap and ugly way out"" he said. ""What I hate in movies -- I mean action movies -- is We need the audience to really hate the bad guy. So lets have him kill two 6-year-olds. "" Martin was thinking too small. The current recipe cooked up in last years Death Race and this weeks Law Abiding Citizen is to have some malefactor slaughter the leading characters wife and child -- the love of his life and his hope for the future -- as he watches helplessly. After that any transgression including wholesale murder is understandable. In real life good men may try to gulp down the black bile of their devastation and move on. They would answer Bernard Shaws question to the 1988 Democratic candidate for President -- ""Governor if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?"" -- in Michael Dukakis measured tone putting principle above vengeance. But that heroic restraint wouldnt make for a good movie. Then again neither does the drearily sadistic Law Abiding Citizen. (See pictures from Nigerias budding film industry.) Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is the mild happily married Philadelphian whos forced to watch his familys atrocity up close. The two killers are arrested but assistant DA Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) whos wary of trying a case he might lose cuts a deal letting one perp testify against the other. One is condemned to death; the other gets a light sentence. Outraged and embittered Shelton lies low for 10 years then activates a revenge scheme that is both madly complex and simply mad. He executes the killers in approved mad-scientist fashion -- one by remote control in prison the other by surgically removing precious body parts and injecting him with ""poison from the liver of a Caribbean puffer fish"" -- and when the police arrive strips naked to greet them as if he were Leonidas facing the Persians at Thermopylae. Shelton is put in prison and thats where the murder games begin in earnest. Apparently Shelton -- and director F. Gary Gray (Friday The Italian Job) -- spent the last decade studying movies like Death Wish the Saw series The Brave One Untraceable and other examples of revenge gorenography. The genre was launched with the 1962 Cape Fear (and its John D. MacDonald source novel) whose killer not only tracks down the lawyer who prosecuted him but terrorizes the mans wife and child. The movies sobering climax -- the lawyer refuses to kill the killer because he will not be reduced even in extremis to his animal impulses -- was rectified in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake where wily psychopath Robert De Niro dies several times. The same year The Silence of the Lambs brought the genre its essential wrinkle of the evil genius beating the criminal-justice system even as he bites its face off. Law Abiding Citizen is yet another Hannibal lecture a tutorial in civics porn. Screenwriter Kurt Wimmer posits that the law is so weak and corrupt an arbiter of guilt that punishment cant be entrusted to it or even to private contractors. (Care to make a little money on the side Blackwater?) No revenge is a dish best wolfed down right now because this time its personal. And for Shelton the body count of retribution is ""gonna be biblical"" -- as in the Egyptian children killed by Gods decree. By midspree and from the seemingly airtight confinement of his prison cell Shelton has effected the violent dispatch of most of the people who had even a peripheral role in his killers judicial fate. And since Rice has a loving wife and a child about the same age as Sheltons when she died the viewer fully expects them to be Sheltons next target. (SPOILER ALERT Theyre not.) The plot has holes deeper than the ones ... no we cant say since that would tip the movies one surprise. Well just say that while Shelton is terrorizing Philadelphia by masterminding his crimes from his solitary cell the prison officials might have thought to post a 24-hour guard nearby. Still caulking those holes wouldnt help its stars bring emotional plausibility to their roles. Foxx seems both fretful and distracted; he can be a vital screen presence but his characters need to act not just react and endure. Butler has the showier part but his impersonation of the tragic hero is undercut by his weird resemblance to Soupy Sales. You start hoping that Shelton will kill somebody with a custard (or puffer-fish) pie to the face. No such luck. The not-very-surprising ending of Law Abiding Citizen is that the real victims are the audience. And what revenge can they take? They probably cant even get their money back.

"Law Abiding Citizen The temptation of the vigilante | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsOpinionLaw Abiding Citizen The temptation of the vigilanteTake movie vigilantism to its horrific extreme and the result is Law Abiding Citizen a brutally effective and alarmingly cathartic combination of Death Wish and Saw .Colm Meaney left and Jamie Foxx are part of a stellar cast that raises Law Abiding Citizen a notch above the standard violent-filled revenge flick.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 16 2009 Law Abiding Citizen 2.5 stars (out of 4) Starring Gerard Butler Jamie Foxx and Colm Meaney. Directed by F. Gary Gray. 108 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Take movie vigilantism to its horrific extreme and the result is Law Abiding Citizen a brutally effective and alarmingly cathartic combination of Death Wish and Saw.You have to credit director F. Gary Gray (Friday) and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer (Street Kings) for recognizing the darkest instinct of vengeful vigilantes and their societal cheerleaders They dont just want bad guys imprisoned they want them destroyed.Thats the psychological ledge Gerard Butlers Clyde Shelton is pushed out on after he witnesses two men rape and murder his wife and young daughter in his own home.Previously a believer in the justice system this mild-mannered engineer suffers a psychotic reversal after showboating Philadelphia prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) cuts a deal with one of the killers. The main bad guy gets a reduced prison sentence in return for testifying against his oafish accomplice who goes to Death Row. Nick has a 96 per cent conviction rate that hes determined to maintain one way or another.To say that Clyde takes this news hard is like saying that Jigsaw from Saw enjoys sick games. Nick actually turns into his own version of Jigsaw complete with a sickening array of instruments to severe all manner of body parts.Clyde complicates his street justice credo with theofascist sanctimony that all of the guilty must pay even if many of the innocent also suffer in the process.The film becomes increasingly implausible in its worst moments recalling the risible Al Pacino vehicle 88 Minutes and its scenario of an imprisoned man making monkeys out of the cops. Yet it maintains incredible momentum thanks in no small part to strong performances by Butler and Foxx who make great cat-and-mouse antagonists.You want to see what happens even as logic tumbles and there are fascinating undercurrents in the bargain. Unusual for a movie like this you can see both sides of the arguments very clearly. The main characters are extreme but also very human in their reactions. Their justifications both demand consideration.Clydes desire for pure revenge is clear and easy to empathize with. Yet Nicks argument about the necessary accommodations of law also makes sense ""Some justice is better than no justice at all.""Anyone who says they havent swung back and forth between those positions in their minds either hasnt lived very long or isnt being honest.

"Law Abiding Citizen | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; law-abiding-citizen ) Law Abiding Citizen (United States 2009) October 16 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The premise of Law Abiding Citizen - angry father seeks revenge on the system when his daughters murderer gets off with a light sentence - probably sounded great in the pitch meetings but as with all high concept motion pictures the devils in the details. For a while F. Gary Grays thriller works on a purely visceral level offering a degree of guilty satisfaction to viewers as one sleazy individual after another gets eliminated in a gruesome Saw-esque manner. Unfortunately Law Abiding Citizen isnt content to be a Death Wish for 2009. It wants to be bigger and bolder. So it takes a simple revenge fantasy and uses it as the core of an elaborate high-stakes game that in shooting for ""inventive"" ends up hitting ""preposterous."" The more Kurt Wimmers screenplay reveals about the lead characters scheme the more difficult it is to believe that Law Abiding Citizen is intended to be taken seriously. The movie opens with a sequence as grim and upsetting as one is likely to find in a mainstream movie engineer Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) is enjoying a quiet evening at home with his wife and daughter when the pleasant domestic scene is interrupted by the sound of someone knocking. Thinking its a takeout delivery Clyde carelessly opens the door and is whacked in the head with a bat. The next thing he knows hes barely conscious gagged and bound and is forced to watch as his wife is raped and killed. Then his young daughter is taken into another room for a similar treatment. Several months later the criminals are awaiting trial and the assistant D.A. assigned to the case Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) decides to do the expedient thing to preserve his 96% conviction rate allow one of the two suspects - the one who committed the most heinous deeds - to provide evidence against the other and plead guilty to a reduced count of third degree murder. This does not sit well with Clyde who views it as a betrayal by the justice system. Hes a patient man however and spends the better part of the next ten years concocting a convoluted plot by which he can execute a wrath of ""Biblical"" proportions upon all those involved including the perpetrators the judge the D.A. and Nick. His goal isnt mere vengeance; he wants to bring down a system that he believes to be broken beyond repair. One questionable decision made by the filmmakers is to represent Clyde who is essentially a domestic terrorist sympathetically and to have Nick come across negatively. Grays intention was probably to show some good and evil in both characters but by the way in which the movie is constructed most audience members will be on Clydes side even when his killings slip from the level of being ""righteous"" to something questionable. Nick on the other hand is established almost as a villain not only because he stands in Clydes way but because he is part of the ""problem"" that places Clyde on the vigilantes path. When the films third act attempts to follow the traditional formula of the lawman pursuing the criminal we find ourselves hoping the ""bad guy"" gets away and its not at all clear that this is what Gray wants us to feel. The biggest problem with Law Abiding Citizen however is that the plot is just plain dumb. It makes little enough sense during the course of the proceedings and none whatsoever when studied in hindsight. Its also more than a little disappointing that someone as brilliant as Clyde makes some supremely stupid moves. Theres nothing more frustrating than being told how smart a character is then not consistently seeing it in his actions. There are some stinging verbal exchanges between Clyde and Nick but they pale in comparison with their likely inspiration the Hannibal/Clarice interaction in The Silence of the Lambs. Theres also the question of why an assistant D.A. is participating in police chases but I guess the filmmakers wanted Jamie Foxx to have more to do than stand around looking dapper in his suit. Had Law Abiding Citizen stuck to the tried-and-true Death Wish trajectory it likely would have been an uninspired but entertaining diversion. By turning the killing spree into a game with no obvious winning criteria the movie defeats itself. Not only is the resolution unsatisfying but it sets the bar for the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" unreasonably high. This is another instance in which a trailer promises a level of intrigue and intelligence that the full feature cannot deliver. Law Abiding Citizen is sloppy and disappointing.

"Law Abiding Citizen Movie review of Law Abiding Citizen by Roger Moore - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Law Abiding Citizen -- 2 out of 5 stars Gerard Butler Universal Universal Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Law Abiding Citizen is a glib brutal and preposterous revenge fantasy a take-the-law-in-your-own-hands rabble rouser that taps into a lot of fears and genuine gripes about the American legal system. Its the sort of movie that Mel Gibson or Clint Eastwood might have made back in the day -- a man survives the slaughter of his family by thugs and sets out to get even and then some. Gerard Butler has the title role Clyde Shelton a ""tinkerer"" who is stabbed during a home invasion. Jamie Foxx is the politically ambitious Philadelphia prosecutor who lets one of the killers get off easy so that the other will be executed. ""Its not what you know its what you can prove in court"" Nick Rice tells a distraught Clyde. Nick is listening to his boss (Bruce McGill). ""In this job your best asset is a short memory."" But thats not Clyde. Ten years later when one of the killers is finally executed his elaborate revenge begins.Citizen is a ""You dont know who youre messing with"" thriller like Taken. Clyde may be a Law Abiding Citizen but hes got gadget skills and a sadistic streak. When he kills crooks and the legal eagles who kept them from justice he makes them suffer. Almost all of them have terrifying seconds to realize their fate. Nick knows who is doing this even locks up Clyde. But since hes the ultimate quarry in this blood feud Nick must see those around him die at Clydes gadget-guru hands.Butler gives Clyde a wicked glee at what he is doing but only a hint of the humanity he lost when his wife and daughter were slain. His battle-of-brains-and-wills scenes with Foxx dont have a lot of snap and since those confrontations are the heart here that drains some energy off the film. A rich canvas of character actors ( Colm Meaney Viola Davis) are mostly plot necessities. The Kurt Wimmer (The Recruit) script has a cruel wit up until it falls apart in a dishonest and outlandish third act. Director F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job) maintains his rep for action scenes that deflate on screen.Youd like to hope that filmmakers outside of the horror genre anyway dont start from a place of utter cynicism. But we know exactly what were dealing with in Law Abiding Citizen. Its a ""Who dies next?"" slasher film masquerading as a revenge thriller.Law Abiding Citizen Two of five stars Cast Jamie Foxx Gerard Butler Viola Davis Colm Meaney Leslie BibbDirector F.

But most of what we see on the screen is implausible superficial and only marginally involving. Gerard Butler plays Clyde Shelton seemingly a tragic Everyman who has never gotten over the brutal killing of his wife and child. But his desire for vengeance soon becomes warped and uncontrollable. When he embarks on a systematic and ultra-vicious murdering spree Clyde becomes something far more perverse. We find out from a mysterious colleague that Clyde is actually a ""tactician."" Is that what they call assassins these days? Sounds like a euphemism but the way his associate draws out the word its obviously meant to sum up the whole of Clydes sociopathic tendencies and vicious proclivities. The criminals responsible for the deaths of his wife and child dont get the punishment or prison time they should for their heinous act. So Clyde becomes judge jury and especially executioner. Certainly weve seen this conceit in movies before. Ordinary law-abiding guy goes berserk when his loved ones are brutalized and revenge is his only recourse. (Charles Bronson anyone?) In this case what ups the ante is how the victims and Clyde are betrayed by the vagaries of the judicial system. But the filmmakers stretch the tired idea of revenge and moral outrage beyond all proportion. And in the process the movie loses all credibility. When Clyde announces that hes ""at war"" with the system its not hyperbole. Heavy machinery robotic weaponry and high-tech surveillance systems improbably come into play. Clydes main nemesis is Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) the assistant district attorney who prosecuted the murders. Nick has a wife and young daughter and at first is quietly understanding of Clydes effort to settle scores. But Clyde pushes it beyond reason and loses Nicks sympathy. Then he pummels ours. He goes from ordinary Joe to madman far too easily. This is not Butlers best role -- his Scottish accent occasionally pops through his American English intonation. Its not Foxxs best work either. He doesnt dig into the role but given its one-dimensionality who can blame him? Viola Davis so powerful in last years Doubt has a one-note turn as the mayor of Philadelphia. All shes given to do is spend a few scenes furious that a one-man killing machine has been allowed to terrorize her city. The film purports to examine the complexity of our flawed court system and attempts to show that neither Clyde nor Nick is doing the right thing. But the exploration of right and wrong and its complicated lack of clarity gets trammeled amid the bevy of explosions volley of bullets and mounting body count.

Revenge is a dish best served with car bombs and chainsaws in ""Law Abiding Citizen"" a twisty hybrid of serial-killer suspenser legal thriller and prison drama that in between grisly setpieces attempts to raise significant questions about the failures of the criminal justice system. Yet far more than any tacked-on moral dilemmas its Gerard Butlers juicy performance as a grieving father turned mass-murdering psycho genius that powers this self-serious pulp entertainment. Overture release packs enough potent shocks to lure sizable thrill-seeking crowds to multiplexes (the owners of which are hopefully smart enough to hyphenate the title on the marquee). Wasting no time the pic plunges the viewer immediately into a horrific yet unprotracted domestic bloodbath. Two men break into the home of Philadelphia family man Clyde Shelton (Butler) whos forced to watch helplessly as they murder his wife and young daughter. Exactly how and why Clyde survives the senseless assault is left unexamined by Kurt Wimmers screenplay which quickly abandons the scene of the crime in favor of a longer stay in legal chambers where matters of guilt and innocence arent quite so cut-and-dried. Unable to convict both killers due to insufficient evidence prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) a careerist accustomed to compromise arranges a deal with one of the perps Darby (Christian Stolte) so he can send the other to death row. But thats not good enough for Clyde who waits 10 long years for vengeance -- and well worth the wait it is as he abducts Darby and lays him out on an operating table apparently on loan from the ""Saw"" prop department. True torture-porn aficionados will be disappointed as editor Tariq Anwar cuts away right before blade meets flesh -- a move that feels a tad well gutless under the circumstances. But elsewhere ""Citizen"" proves startlingly graphic even by R-rated standards; as Clydes killing spree continues now targeting the key players in the decade-old murder case one starts watching every scene in nervous anticipation that heads or SUVs might explode without warning. Even after hes apprehended and locked up Clyde remains 10 steps ahead of everyone else including Nick who tries in vain to stop this homicidal mastermind. Like a younger hunkier Hannibal Lecter Clyde plays nasty mind games makes ludicrous demands and is in every way determined to shake the foundations of so-called law and order. Just as Nick is outwitted again and again by Clyde so top-billed Foxx is overmatched here by Butler -- who even if he cant quite make sense of an impossible character (a loving husband and father warped by unspeakable trauma into a one-man WMD) clearly relishes the challenge. Whether hes savoring a steak (delivered in exchange for info about a victims whereabouts) or in the pics most galvanizing moment telling off a judge Butler gives the picture a pulse and keeps it throbbing steadily through the first hour which shamelessly feeds the viewers own appetite for revenge. Butler makes such a charismatic villain/antihero that you never quite stop rooting for him which is a credit to the performance but also a dramatic handicap -- one that serves to show how disposable the good guys are even those played by such sterling character vets as Bruce McGill Colm Meaney and Viola Davis. Director F. Gary Gray (making a smooth return to filmmaking four years after ""Be Cool"") lends the pic some of the procedural flair and attention to detail that distinguished his souped-up 2003 remake of ""The Italian Job."" But ""Citizen"" is a more bloated affair and it winds up feeling overwritten yet underexplained foregoing plausible revelations in favor of gusty debate about the ethical challenges of practicing and upholding the law. Suspense deflates even as the body count escalates. Using a steely color palette to emphasize its moral gray zones the pic benefits significantly from its Philly locations which include City Hall and Holmesburg Prison.

Jamie Fox and Gerard Butler star in Overture Films ""LAW ABIDING CITIZEN."" Photo John Baer Overture Films Movie review Law Abiding Citizen is grisly 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Law Abiding Citizen Drama. Starring Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler. Directed by F. Gary Gray. (R. 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) In the first half-hour of ""Law Abiding Citizen"" a beetle-browed bear of a man named Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) watches helplessly as two thugs burst into his home one of them slaying his wife and daughter. He watches helplessly as the first thug gets sent to death row while the second the actual murdering scumbag pleads to a lesser charge. The architect of this deal is Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) a slick prosecuting attorney who cares more about his conviction rate than actual justice. Once more Clyde watches helplessly as Nick and the killer shake hands outside a Philadelphia courthouse. Ten years later Clydes all done with helpless watching. He replaces the potassium chloride in Thug No. 1s execution drip with something that makes him bleed through his skin. Then he dismembers Thug No. 2 in a brief ugly spate of Hostel-meets-Saw torture-porn moralizing complete with hand tools. This is all in the first half-hour. What happens afterward doesnt really matter because it makes absolutely no sense and performs no function beyond the repeat stimulation of the audiences collective lizard brain. For a long time now Ive been growing weary of the omnipotent bad guy - the one who engineers a violent crusade from some remote corner usually a basement and knows all sees all does all kills all mocking all doofus cops and politicos who make some attempt to restrain him. But Clyde takes the cake. I do like Butler. He can act. The part however mainly requires him to issue all-knowing proclamations and scrunch up his face in righteous outrage. As Nick Foxx frowns back. There isnt much else for him to do having been rendered toothless by an unconquerable foe. On the other hand Nick has a beautiful wife (Regina Hall) and a daughter (Emerald-Angel Young) who plays cello - an elegiac touch that gives director F. Gary Gray and screenwriter Kurt Wimmer a chance to go all ""Godfather"" on us. ""Law Abiding Citizen"" is not badly made. Its basic premise isnt necessarily a lame one; lots of films have explored the failures of justice and the snapping points of decent citizens. Vigilante movies hold a firm place in cinematic history but for them to work the vigilante needs to be a sympathetic anti-hero. Whatever cause he takes up whatever hell he creates whatever basement he crawls into we need to follow him willingly. He needs to seem human. And Clyde - omnipotent omniscient omnipresent Clyde - does not. -- Advisory Strong bloody brutal violence and torture a scene of rape and pervasive language.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint How long a film career can a tight set of abs give you? Gerard Butler whose six-pack starred in ""300"" returns in what feels like his 14th film this year a tiny whirlpool of pain titled ""Law Abiding Citizen."" In this sordid nasty revenge melodrama he plays Clyde an omniscient inventor/murderer who can kill his enemies from inside a high-security lockup. He also has a cast-iron stomach as revealed in an inexplicable nude scene. Butler who also produced the film knows what hes selling. The film opens with Clyde getting a baseball bat to the forehead as a pair of scumbags invade his Philadelphia home bind him and do unspeakable things to his wife and daughter. For the next 108 minutes the film is the brain-pummeling bat and were the forehead. The setup is vigilante rubbish about plea bargains and reduced sentences for murderous sociopaths. Jamie Foxx plays Nick a suave ambitious prosecutor who cuts a wrist-slap deal with one of Clydes attackers to assure the pairs conviction and protect Nicks 96 percent success rate. Nick tells the inconsolable widower that the maneuver is simple pragmatism but it feels amoral to Clyde. The vengeful gearhead unleashes a high-tech reign of terror beginning with the guys who killed his family and working his way up the justice system toward Nick himself. The movie is not -- putting it courteously -- tightly constructed. The narrative shifts are jerky and the tone bounces around like a Jeep on a dirt road. Clydes near-mystical ability to bushwhack his victims is a promising set-up and this crazed idealists palm-rubbing glee when he has a villain in his clutches is schlocky fun. But the ""Saw""-inspired scenes of torture that follow will put stomach acid in the back of your throat. Though hes quickly imprisoned his vengeance continues escalating to baroque heights of ingeniousness. Clyde even times his victims deaths so that they exit on a snappy line of dialogue or a heart-wringing farewell glance. Foxxs role is to bargain with the mad genius and arrive on the scene of his latest outrage seconds too late to save the prey. He scrolls through his dialogue in a cramped robotized performance. His big acting moment comes when Butlers threats dance close to Foxxs family; Foxx flares his nostrils to signal that hed better not. Butler has little presence or style. Neither Kurt Wimmers script nor F. Gary Grays direction is interested in the people onscreen as individuals. Theyre archetypes from the thriller manual. Only Viola Davis (the Oscar-nominated scene-stealer from ""Doubt"") as the intelligent impatient Philadelphia mayor shakes the movie alive. She plays this good character the way most actors play villains scowling and indignant. She puts the city under martial law snapping ""If you have to give shotguns to the meter maids do it"" LAW ABIDING CITIZEN  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for violence sexual violence torture profanity and adult themes. The story falls right down the cellar steps when Foxx discovers how Butler has been accomplishing the assassinations. Its a preposterous twist quickly followed by a completely improbable double cross and a sappy resolution at a childs music recital. If this hot mess is Butlers idea of a thriller hed better keep doing his crunches.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + You dont want to snicker when two rows of parked cars suddenly blow up in ""Law Abiding Citizen. But thats the only response to such desperate moviemaking. Theres no earthly reason for that explosion. Nor is there an explanation for lines like ""I do my job. Im the best at it. It works. Thats Jamie Foxx to Gerard Butler but it may as well be Tom Cruise in anything.Foxx plays Nick Rice a rising star in the Philadelphia district attorneys office and for the first time in Foxxs career he appears to be performing his role from the bank where he cashed his check. Hes seen this movie before and so have we. Ten years ago Nick arranged a plea bargain for testimony against a man who killed the wife and daughter of Clyde Shelton (Butler) an engineer who still cant believe that justice was only half served. In the decade thats passed Clyde has been exacting revenge against just about anyone involved in the murders and the trial.You would think a movie about the lawyers attempt to stop the maniac would be a welcome change of pace from watching the cops try. How untrue. The movie appears to have been written by an automated thriller generator (enter city enter occupations enter films whose box office youd like to emulate). So it hardly matters whos stopping Butler. (Kurt Wimmer gets credit for the script.) The plot and its twists remain the same. So does the dialogue. ""Lessons learned are soon forgotten. ""Thats how winners play. ""Im gonna bring this whole diseased temple down on your head. Its gonna be biblical Most of the lines sound as if they were first spoken on ""CSI ""NCIS or the WWE.The central mystery in ""Law Abiding Citizen revolves around how Butler manages to kill judges and lawyers when hes supposed to be serving time in a maximum-security prison. Which means the movie also revolves around a mound of human stupidity. Really? Theres no cop or security officer to stop that giant grenade-launching robot before it opens fire on a funeral procession? Viola Davis addresses some of this when she makes a late appearance as the mayor but the onus to straighten this out is actually on us.How are we to believe for instance that Butler can bring a city to its knees with his intellect?Much of his role requires him to banter with Foxx cutting deals with the DAs office to save the lives Clyde has left in jeopardy. He requests a steak dinner and ""all the trimmings. Hed like an iPod. If not somebody dies. Clyde shanks his cellmate to death then placidly hops onto his bunk covered in blood. This is hackneyed serial-killer stuff from Hannibal Lecter down to the murderers of ""Se7en and ""Saw.And if theres a prayer of bringing this character off you need an actor capable not simply of danger but of the evil required to say send a DVD of a live dismemberment to a 10-year-old girl (oh Clyde). You need an actor who can conjure nastiness with panache and pedantry. He has to want the steak and the nice Chianti to wash it down. Butler looks like a Guinness man.In romantic comedies Butler contributes a welcome dose of swagger at a time when machismo is in distressingly short supply. This is to say he needs the challenge of the opposite sex. Otherwise he seems shut down especially here. Its hard to blame him. Since the movie has no interest in taking seriously the grief and rage that fuels revenge he has nothing emotional to play.Most of the side actors - Colm Meaney Regina Hall Michael Kelly - are underused. And Butler and Foxx deserve to mix it up in a movie with a lot more going for it. This one doesnt even have the heart to be a decent work of trash. Which is not to say its not tasteless.In combining all those procedural shows with ""Saw and ""The Silence of the Lambs the director F. Gary Gray (""The Italian Job) gets to play with all kinds of weaponry (rockets automatic machine guns improvised explosive devices). Helicopters swoop urgently past the camera. Like a lot of action-movie directors Gray lacks the imagination to view the art of cat-and-mouse as more than a chance to play with state-of-the-art war technology. It used to be all you needed was a scowl and a .44 Magnum. This movie uses an arsenal that turns Philadelphia into Afghanistan.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet It goes without saying that the Saw movies are preposterous. Audiences readily accept--as they should--the silly idea of a devious puppetmaster working behind the scenes to lead victims to various forms of mechanized slaughter. There are plenty of adjectives to describe the franchise (""venal"" ""sick"" ""repetitive"" ""ugly"") but the premise itself outrageous though it may be falls well within the boundaries for gross-out horrors. The same cannot be said of Law Abiding Citizen a flagrantly ridiculous thriller that tries to retrofit Saw to function as a mainstream semi-respectable vigilante picture about the failings of our justice system. Its one thing to expect audiences to squirm over say a horror victim forced to dig a key of his eye socket but its another to expect them to leave the theater scratching their chins over prosecutorial misconduct. The icky opening scene finds Gerard Butler a middle-class tech wizard unsuccessfully attempting to fend off two intruders who murder his wife and daughter. Lacking the hard evidence to bring the case to trial assistant district attorney Jamie Foxx accepts a plea bargain that lets the chief perpetrator take a lesser sentence in exchange for testimony that sends his partner to death row. Pleased enough with bolstering his conviction rate Foxx reasons that ""some justice is better than no justice."" But needless to say Butler isnt satisfied with the deal. Ten years later Butler uses his technical know-how to go vigilante but he isnt just after the killer--he wants to take down the whole damned system. The means through which Butler goes about terrorizing judges prosecutors and government officials are unseemly enough but more disturbing still is that Law Abiding Citizen appears to be in his corner. Of the two Foxx is the flawed man taking the moral journey here forced to realize that his thoughtless self-serving tactics as assistant D.A. are doing a disservice to people who want justice for their slain family members. And who better to set him straight than a raging sociopath? Its an outrageous concept that the film takes seriously. Coming soon a Silence Of The Lambs sequel featuring Hannibal Lecter as a life coach.

Cars and cell phones are blowing up the public is in a panic. And so the understandably ill-tempered mayor (a sharp-suited Viola Davis) convenes an emergency meeting of the police the sheriffs department the FBI even Homeland Security. Shes demanding action.""If you have to give shotguns to the meter maids"" she snaps ""do it""Uh-oh run for your lives.An over-the-top and grisly howdunit Law Abiding Citizen - opening Philadelphia Film Festival 181/2 tonight and playing everywhere starting tomorrow - fuses Death Wish vigilante vengeance with the mad-genius-behind-bars puppet-mastery of Hannibal Lecter. That the film directed in swift strokes by F. Gary Gray from a screenplay credited to Kurt Wimmer doesnt really work - unrelentingly grim unintentionally funny - is almost beside the point. Its a wild concept.Scotsman Butler big brooding and approximating some kind of Philly-speak is Clyde Shelton. By all appearances hes a regular Joe He makes gizmos while his little girl strings beads and his wife cooks dinner in the kitchen. But thats the prologue A few minutes later two thugs rap at the door a home invasion nightmare ensues and Clydes family is destroyed.The perps are arrested but the case isnt a lock and so ace assistant D.A. Nick Rice (Foxx) makes a deal with one of the murderers to rat out the other. Lethal injection for one but just a few years in the pen for the other - and hes the real creep.""Some justice is better than no justice at all"" Nick tries to explain. But Clyde stunned and disbelieving is having none of it. Instead hell have revenge - a dish best served cold. (Later on hell order a porterhouse from Del Friscos - one of several dubious product placements.)Strangely Law Abiding Citizen really has no hero. Butlers an odd sort of antihero his character cheated by ""this broken thing"" of a justice system and at first he has our sympathy. But by the time Clyde straps one of his victims to a table - looming crazily over him with scalpel and box cutters revving up the power saw - its hard to root for the guy.As for Foxxs Nick hes just too icy a character to care about - he wont even take the time to watch his little girl play cello at the school recital. Foxx does the aloof all-business thing convincingly enough. But not so much the moments when his character lets his emotions in (or out). Its a remote uncharismatic performance.Philadelphians will get a kick out of seeing Butler Foxx Leslie Bibb (another assistant D.A.) and Colm Meany (an unshaven cop) navigating the Escher-like stairwells of City Hall. There are vertiginous aerial shots of the skyline a close-up of Billy Penns mug and even a deadpan cameo from the citys current real mayor Mr. Nutter.But Law Abiding Citizen isnt one of those wow-dont- we-live-in-a-handsome-town affairs. Like the name of its director the movie - and the mood of the city in it - is all gray.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Photo Credit Overture Films advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Mastermind takes revenge on the legal system that cut a deal with his familys killer. BOTTOM LINE Certainly nothing wrong here that a new script a new director and a couple of committed actors couldnt fix. CAST Jamie Foxx Gerard Butler Bruce McGill Colm Meaney Leslie Bibb LENGTH 148 The words ""dumb"" and ""thriller"" are seldom used in the same sentence and ""Law Abiding Citizen"" illustrates all the reasons why. Not only is it a hapless crime drama about outrage and revenge it provides the sad spectacle of a movie far less intelligent than the one its filmmakers thought they were making. Starring Jamie Foxx as a scruple-free prosecutor and Gerard Butler as the victim he cheats out of justice ""Law Abiding Citizen"" (yes it needs a hyphen and a new script) has so many plot holes preposterous procedures and impotent gestures that it would take till the sports section to list them. advertisement | advertise on newsday Suffice to say if a films going to appeal to your worst instincts you shouldnt be feeling bad about it before the credits roll. Clyde Shelton (Butler) saw his family killed but hotshot Philly prosecutor Nick Rice (Foxx) makes a deal with one of the murderers just so he can maintain his 96 percent conviction rate. Ten years later when the other killer is about to be executed Shelton re-enters the picture with appallingly violent results. Strangely theres never any development in how the characters are perceived - were with Clyde all the way despite his homicidal mania which is perpetrated even while hes in prison - a minor detail thats never really explained. Perhaps because Foxx is giving such a self-satisfied performance imageCaption Butler steals the movie and doesnt even strain himself doing it. But laziness is probably ""LACs"" greatest virtue.

Gary Gray; Author Kurt Wimmer; Release Date Wide 10/16/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 108; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Overture Posted October 14 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT Remember Charles Bronson in Death Wish? Law Abiding Citizen offers a taste of no-mercy vigilante family-man justice 3.0. Ten years after his wife and daughter were slaughtered in front of him Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) kidnaps one of the perpetrators straps him down to a torture table and saws off his limbs (and other things). Then he sends a video of the atrocity to Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) the slick out-for-himself Philadelphia prosecutor who cut too soft a deal with the killer. Clyde is one of those movie madmen who turns vengeance into a ""game."" Hes Bronson crossed with the didactic sadist of the Saw films. Under arrest he somehow devises a way to further his rampage from within the walls of a maximum-security prison -- and thats a pretty big somehow especially when you learn how hes doing it. Clyde is meant to be nuts but too often its Law Abiding Citizen that checks rationality at the door. Butler and Foxx engage in sub?Silence of the Lambs word duels but during these scenes what I mostly noticed is how quickly Ive grown tired of Butlers mush-mouthed bravura and also how much I hope that Foxx who looks bored holds his slumming down to this one film.

Then Deals are cut the murderer walks while his less culpable accomplice is sentenced to death and the dad wonders ""But what about justice?"" And then A decade passes dad has seen a Saw or two and its retribution time. Everyone must pay even the innocent. So much for our sympathy for the leading man who happens to be Gerard Butler in yet another questionable role. Director F. Gary Gray and writer Kurt Wimmer peddle cheap graphic Z-grade revenge thrills dressed up as Knowing Sociopolitical Commentary--as in the justice systems rotten so lets blow up then gut then roast again the whole sumbitch and start from scratch. Jamie Foxxs prosecutor (smug a slow learner) gets a front-row seat to the explosion as Butlers Clyde Shelton goes behind bars and into solitary confinement from where somehow he is capable of inflicting enough damage and carnage to terrorize the whole of Philadelphia. Clyde wont stop speechifying about doing bad things in the name of the greater good. If the filmmakers meant a word of it theyd quit making films and do something more useful. Saw with a conscience is not what the world needs.
