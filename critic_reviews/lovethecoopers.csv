From the smarminess ofA Valentines DayA to the uninspired idiocy ofA New Years Eve these films can be downright offensive to those who dare to watch them too closely. The characters tend to be both cliched and thin the situations both unconvincing and fragmented -- all usually tied up with a glib message seemingly cobbled together from Hallmarks discards. (Theres one calledA Mothers DayA coming up; get excited.) So imagine my surprise upon discovering that the latest iteration of this largely repellent subgenreA Love the Coopers appears to have been written by sentient people who have observed real human beings in the wild. Dont get me wrong Its just as often manipulative and contrived but Jessie Nelsons film sells itself well. Theres care in the details and the characters often feel like actual people. The film shows us the extended members of the family in question as they get ready in their own individual anguished ways for Christmas dinner. When we first see matriarch Charlotte (Diane Keaton) shes arranging her 37th snow globe around the house but were told her perfectionism doesnt extend to her marriage to Sam (John Goodman) which is falling apart; after the family dinner the two will announce that theyre splitting up which is why she wants everything else to be perfect. The whole family it seems is dreading coming together. The Coopers son Hank (Ed Helms) a divorced dad of three kids has been hiding the fact that hes lost his job as a family portrait photographer. Their daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) is in an airport bar getting nice and soused preparing for the inevitable judgment of her family when suddenly she meets Joe (Jake Lacy) a soldier returning home. Charlottes dad Bucky (Alan Arkin) prefers to spend his time eating at a local diner talking movies and life with waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfried). Meanwhile Charlottes younger sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) who has always lived under Big Siss shadow shoplifts a brooch which she intended to give Charlotte and gets herself arrested by a stone-faced cop (Anthony Mackie). Thats a whole lot of stuff but its general shape is pretty clear early on This is a movie about how we dont really appreciate the good things in life when theyre actually happening and the importance of stopping toA beA happy now and then. Predictable to be sure -- Frank Capra mined this territory pretty thoroughly many decades ago -- butA Love the CoopersA wins points for its refreshingly dark sensibility. Its not afraid to call bullshit on holiday cheer and clear-eyed about the fact that holiday gatherings are often settings for heartbreak and misery. Director Nelson and screenwriter Steven Rogers (who wroteA Stepmom Hope Floats andA P.S. I Love You so he clearly knows his way around a tearjerker) give many of the characters stylized little montage flashbacks played sometimes for bittersweet adorableness sometimes for genuine pain. A portly security guard remembers all his previous kisses under the mistletoe reaching back to his childhood; Mackies cop recalls how his mom shamed him out of smiling as a kid and we see a series of portraits showing his progression from boisterous young child to grim police cadet; Ruby remembers serving dinner to her family back when she was a child because her mom was too drunk to do so. Sometimes the past and the present commingle When Bucky makes a particularly earnest declaration Ruby sees him for an instant as the young man he used to be. That cast helps too. Movies likeA New Years EveA have to settle for people like Ashton Kutcher and Lea Michele and Jon Bon Jovi delivering their dialogue; here when John Goodman turns to his soon-to-be-separated wife and says ""We had a good run Charlotte. Nobody can say we didnt try"" he fills it with the heartache of a lifetime. The words are simple but theyre backed by feeling. All too often this kind of film can feel like a series of narrative tactics in search of a story -- the fragmented structure a crutch holding up underwritten under-thought ideas. But the individual strands and characters inA Love the CoopersA feel like theyve been thought through and I could easily watch an entire film built around just one of them. That might be the highest compliment I can pay a film like this.

If youre the sort of person who likes to know exactly whats under the tree on Christmas morning this creaky old-fashioned festive comedy might be for you. Love the Coopers ticks off literally every home-for-the-holidays box--in dutiful uninspired fashion. Theres the older couple (Diane Keaton and John Goodman) stocking up on canned cranberries waiting for the kids and wondering where the years went. Theres the divorced son (Ed Helms) praying for a romantic miracle and the single daughter (Olivia Wilde) who needs to learn not to be so independent and to find a good solid guy (Jake Lacy). Theres the lonely old man (Alan Arkin) the awkward hates-everything teen (Timothee Chalamet) and even the dotty old woman who dispenses inappropriate language and twinkly wisdom in roughly equal measure (Nebraskas June Squibb). There are flickers of wit and even insight Steven Rogerss screenplay moves along nicely and at least one storyline--between Marisa Tomeis restless lonelyheart and Anthony Mackies closeted gay cop--feels like its going somewhere vaguely interesting. But the climax is painfully predictable Yes someone keels over into the mashed potatoes paving the way for much hugging learning and growing. The films final moments in which we discover the source of the films intrusive patronizing voiceover are simply vile. The result is like stuffing yourself with Christmas pudding sweet glutinous a bit too much.

Diane Keaton and John Goodman head up a family thats supposed to be delightfully dysfunctional but is really just a clutch of ill-conceived characters forced into sub-sitcom situations Son Ed Helms is a deflated divorced dad whos been hiding his joblessness from his family for months; daughter Olivia Wilde feels misunderstood by her parents and acts out like an unbearable two-year-old. To make things extra-complicated Mom and Dad are planning to separate just after the Christmas holiday -- they cant take it anymore and by the end of Love the Coopers neither can we. Film Details Love the Coopers RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time106 min. More Info Trailer There are one or two places where the picture almost ignites Alan Arkin plays the familys gruff-love granddad who has befriended a diner waitress (Amanda Seyfried) -- at one point he tells her that he feels closer to her than to anyone else and their tender kinship is the most believable element of the movie. Otherwise if youve been wishing and hoping for a movie in which June Squibb -- here playing a dementia-riddled relative named Aunt Fishy -- shows her underpants yet again youll love Love the Coopers.

Suzanne Tenner/Courtesy of CBS Films hide caption toggle caption Suzanne Tenner/Courtesy of CBS Films (Left to right) Amanda Seyfried Jake Lacy Olivia Wilde Maxwell Simkins Blake Baumgartner John Goodman Ed Helms Alan Arkin Diane Keaton and Alex Borstein make up the Cooper family in Love the Coopers. Suzanne Tenner/Courtesy of CBS Films The Coopers have a gorgeous kitchen. And since its Christmastime those granite countertops are lined end to end with magazine-ready displays of food fresh chocolate pastries fluffy mashed potatoes brilliant red tomatoes a shimmering glazed ham with pineapple slices. The extended family gathers only once a year under the same roof and Charlotte (Diane Keaton) the matriarch wants everything to be perfect. Even Rags the family dog has a festive red bow tied around its neck. This is all pretext for a holiday entertainment that feels more like a horror movie. In the ignoble tradition of Home for the Holidays The Family Stone and other seasonal heart-warmers Love the Coopers presents itself as a wacky ensemble dramedy but its really a cry for help. Christmas is supposed to be a catalyst for change but the contrast between Charlottes immaculate stagecraft and the mass dysfunction that lands on her doorstep makes the whole film brittle tense and joyless. Marriages are ending. Sibling relationships are strained. Charlottes adult children roil with anxiety and resentment. Even the grandkids are swearing and getting into fistfights. With minimal tweaking the film could be turned into a Bunuelian picture of bourgeois collapse. With Steve Martin providing the novelistic narration -- his true identity is the last of the films eye-rolling jokes -- Love the Coopers lays out a series of family subplots each more depressing than the last. Charlotte intends to leave Sam (John Goodman) her husband of 40 years after the holidays are over but begs him to keep the bad news under wraps. Their daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) a pushy big-city type so fears her mothers disapproval that she ropes a straight-laced military man (Jake Lacy) into acting like her boyfriend. Their son Hank (Ed Helms) is a still sadder case an unemployed mall-portrait photographer whose marriage has fallen apart. It scarcely gets cheerier from there. Eleanors resentful sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) gets caught shoplifting a brooch and spends most of Christmas Eve pleading with a cop (Anthony Mackie) from the back of a police cruiser. Grandpa Bucky (Alan Arkin) a retired professor is so desperately lonely that he goes to a lousy diner just to talk to a waitress (Amanda Seyfried) whos friendly to him. Meanwhile batty Aunt Fishy (June Squibb) and Hanks daughter (Blake Baumgartner) a Cindy Lou Who lookalike are stealthily competing to say the most inappropriate thing at the dinner table. With a cast this big and star-filled its perhaps inevitable that most of the subplots feel woefully underserved but nothing in Love the Coopers suggests that theyd benefit from the extra attention. Director Jessie Nelson who has experience with both Keaton (Because I Said So) and Christmas (Fred Claus) as a screenwriter toggles between these mini-psychodramas with the grinding artlessness of a network TV show. But TV shows have the advantage of following the ebb and flow of family relationships for seasons at a time; a movie like Love the Coopers treats Christmas as a car wash that polishes up bruised feelings and leaves a mistletoe hanging from the rearview mirror. Though Love the Coopers follows the holiday-movie playbook to the letter right down to the main course sliding across the hardwood floor it doubles as a distinctly uncomfortable reading of the upper-middle-class American family. When the Coopers are sitting in a room together there are so many pockets of discontent that their resentment rings at a higher frequency than their ritualistic Christmas carols. They cant stand each other but they go through the motions of a happy family led by Charlotte and Sam who refuse to disclose that their marriage the very foundation of the Cooper clan is actively crumbling. Love the Coopers is a Christmas movie for families incapable of talking about their feelings until they explode. Its to be watched through your hands.

The movie opens in U.S. theaters on Nov. ... more Photo Suzanne Tenner HONS Cast punch lines save Coopers from pedestrian holiday fare 1 / 3 Back to Gallery An exceptional cast and a few on-target punch lines are the positives for ""Love the Coopers"" an otherwise pedestrian holiday comedy about a dysfunctional family. Its part sitcom and part soap opera that pokes mild fun at the season but has a wide sentimental streak. The Coopers are Charlotte (Diane Keaton) and Sam (John Goodman) Charlottes father Bucky (Alan Arkin) and a gaggle of children and grandchildren. Charlotte and Sam have a secret Theyre about to split up as she is unwilling to accompany him on a long-dreamed-of getaway. But first is Christmas dinner with their offspring Hank (Ed Helms) a single dad who is out of work; Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) a sharp-tongued and lonely writer; Emma (Marisa Tomei) a troubled soul who gets arrested for shoplifting early on; and assorted significant others former spouses and children. And a large dog who likes to snatch food from dinner plates. Bucky has befriended (in a nonsexual way) a young waitress (Amanda Seyfried) at the local diner and brings her to the holiday meal. Emma tries to analyze the psyche of the police officer who arrests her for stealing from a department store. Eleanor picks up a soldier (Jake Lacy) stranded at the airport aiming to pass him off as a boyfriend so her familly wont bug her about her relationship status - a PC queen she teasingly mocks what she assumes are his right-wing views. Their banter is among the films strengths. More Information Love the Coopers Rated PG-13 for thematic elements language and some sexualityRunning time 118 minutesxxx Various antics ensue the youngsters (first kiss etc.) Charlotte and Sams sledding fun their awkward Christmas performance at a local old folks home. Periodically things get more serious as the characters browbeat each other with not particularly innovative insights and offer bits of what passes for wisdom in Hollywood. Your job now is to guess what are the chances that well see some reconciliations and good vibes as well as melodrama during and after the big dinner. The film is stitched together from familiar scraps of holiday material and a lot of the dialogue must have looked better on paper than it sounds in the movie. But its always a pleasure to watch Arkin in action and the generosity of his character is a hint at what Im guessing is the films point.

CBS Films Jake Lacy and Olivia Wilde in CBS Films ""Love the Coopers."" CBS Films 1 of 2 i By Katie WalshTribune News Service LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The star-studded home for the holidays Christmas movie has become as much a yearly tradition as caroling hot cider and sledding in freshly packed snow. This years installment ""Love the Coopers"" promises to deliver on the cinematic cheer but is more of an airing of grievances than a celebration. Centering around the mishaps and misadventures of the large Cooper clan on Christmas Eve the family has to dredge up all of their demons in order to truly appreciate family.We are introduced to the Coopers via an omnipresent narrator a soul who seems to know them better than they do detailing their inner monologues. Theres the matriarch and patriarch Charlotte (Diane Keaton) and Sam (John Goodman) mourning their lost spark and their son Hank (Ed Helms) divorcing and unemployed. Their daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) lingers at the airport bar trying to prolong returning home to her family right away.There are also a few loose ends that we dont know are connected right away. Emma (Marisa Tomei) gets caught shoplifting a gift and bonds with her arresting officer (Anthony Mackie) claiming to be a psychiatrist. Bucky (Alan Arkin) has to bid farewell to his favorite diner waitress on her last day the beautiful sad Ruby (Amanda Seyfried). Slowly the threads are pulled together and the family gathers around a beautiful table to eat and fight.Fight they do. Among the picturesque white Christmas tableau ""Love the Coopers"" is quite a dark and cynical film with familial spats that are too real to be comfortable. Charlotte squabbles with her husband her daughter and sister and while Keatons inimitable shrill frazzled character is perfect for the role shes almost hard to watch. These characters are all either sad and broken or crazy or both. As they misbehave and lash out its undeniably relatable but it doesnt quite inspire the warm fuzzies.Stylistically the film piles on the Christmas trappings (the caroling is relentless) but is shot with a dim dark style that shows how haggard and sad the Coopers are. Theres also the choice made to visualize so many of their memories and ghosts that haunt their present _ lost loved ones their youth and happiness their relationships. With the voice over multiple storylines and the flashbacks it never quite hits a consistent stride.The bright spot in the film is the chemistry between Wilde as Eleanor and Jake Lacy as Joe a soldier she connects with in the airport. She convinces him to come home to pose as her boyfriend to meet the parents and on this crazy whim they start to fall for each other. The connection between them is electric. Wilde is a reckless playwright with self-destructive romantic tendencies and Lacy is a stoic heroic conservative. Lacy has an ability to elevate any material hes in _ a stealthy scene stealer. Their storyline could have made a great and nuanced little holiday film. Alas ""Love the Coopers"" focuses too much on interfamily drama to salvage the real Christmas spirit.

As directed by occasional filmmaker Jessie Nelson -- who has not helmed a feature film since I Am Sam in 2001 -- Love the Coopers is a sprawling and overly ambitious dramatic comedy about a dysfunctional familys Christmas dinner. And of course about all the petty jealousies misadventures health crises psychological problems relationship problems and sexual hang-ups possible in any large gaggle of relations spread over four generations. Dinner is designed to heal or at least salve some of the wounds. But the Coopers are not just dysfunctional they are falling apart as a family unit. The couple at the eye of this storm -- the mom played by Diane Keaton and the dad played by John Goodman -- are planning to split up after 40 years of marriage as soon as they make it through the holidays. He is still pissed off that they never made it on a dream trip to Africa one that they had been planning for 30 years. No one else in the extended family is any happier. Everyone is on edge. People squabble and argue and yell. One brainless idiot played by Marisa Tomei even gets herself arrested for theft after trying to steal a Christmas gift for her sister Keatons character. The dialogue stuffed in the actors mouths by screenwriter Steven Rogers (who also wrote Hope Floats) is heavy with guilt anger and frustration. On rare occasions the exchanges are mildly amusing. Slapstick comedy also comes into play especially when the children are involved. One exasperated boy splats mashed potatoes into his divorced parents face to get them to stop yelling at each other over the meal. Overarching the cliche-packed story is a long rambling narration voiced by Steve Martin. He is a ""beast"" with words spewing all the supposed insight that the audience needs to make sense of the multiple subplots. But it is relentless and sometimes illogical. Only two of those subplots are at all interesting. One involves the grandfather with 81-year-old Alan Arkin giving the movie its only nuanced accomplished performance. Arkin who has struck up a warm fatherly non-sexual relationship with a waitress in a diner brings her home for dinner. It could have been creepy but Arkin deftly handles the situation while Amanda Seyfried gives the waitress character a lovely innocence mixed with melancholy. The other good subplot involves Olivia Wildes character a failing playwright who is one of the daughters to Keaton and Goodman. She fears more disapproval from her parents. So after meeting a U.S. soldier in the airport bar and striking up a witty conversation she brings him home for dinner as her pretend boyfriend. Wilde is a free spirit but troubled. Her soldier boy played by Jake Lacy is a Bible-thumping Republican who actually admits he is a creationist. She briefly skewers him for this monumental stupidity and cleverly cites the raspy voice of Nina Simone as her own spiritual guide. Otherwise the movie wisely leaves religion and evolution alone and gives us three Bob Dylan tunes instead. Other characters are played by Ed Helms June Squibb Alex Borstein Anthony Mackie and the child actors Timothy Chalamet Maxwell Simkins and Blake Baumgartner. Love the Coopers shares DNA with Bob Clarks Yuletide classic A Christmas Story. There are story beats that are similar; ditto for the narration and brief fantasy-like sequences. But Love the Coopers utterly misses the point of whimsy and wit -- something that Clarks wonderful creation has in abundance -- while indulging in too much meanness for a family Christmas movie.

Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 13 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 13 2015 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jessie Nelson Written by Steven Rogers Starring John Goodman Diane Keaton and Olivia Wilde Classification PG Genre comedy Country USA Language English During a chat with film students in the 1970s director Frank Capra was asked if there were still a way to make movies about the sorts of values and ideas found in his films. ""Well if there isnt"" he said ""we might as well give up."" And that would be a shame.Jessie Nelson hasnt given up. It is clear that the director for her mushy but likeable Christmas comedy Love the Coopers took inspiration from Capras yuletide classic Its a Wonderful Life. The film deals with the human condition of living in the past and fearing the future and of the universal worry of disappointing loved ones in the present. Also Nelson like Capra is in favour of softly falling snow and shameless close-ups of a telegenic woman - in this case Olivia Wilde who is at least as beautiful as Capras Donna Reed. The original title for Love the Coopers was The Most Wonderful Time if not a reference to Its a Wonderful Life certainly one to a seasonal song about the hap-happiest time of the year with lyrics not only mentioning jingle belling and mistletoeing but ghost stories and fond recollections of ""Christmases long long ago.""The Coopers are of course a family represented in Nelsons film with distinct characterizations and by a fine ensemble cast. We see soft-focus flashbacks - memories for example of the central couple played capably by John Goodman and Diane Keaton. They were hippies once chasing each other through the woods. Some 40 years later the couple are about to divorce each other (amicably) but not before they host one more Christmas Eve dinner - a perfect four-generation get-together something for everyone to remember. Because what is life if not for a collection of memories?Alan Arkin is Bucky the paterfamilias. Every day he eats at a diner where he enjoys the company of a doe-eyed waitress (Amanda Seyfried) who reminds him of his late wife. Seyfried plays the blue-plate server adroitly. The character Ruby is sad a little lost and looking for a new start and it is a credit to Seyfried that we didnt need to notice the scar on the inside of Rubys left wrist to pick up on her depression.Marisa Tomei is excellent as Emma a quirky life coach with a complicated relationship with her older sister Charlotte (played lightly by Keaton). The casting is a bit odd while the siblings are five or six years apart Tomei and Keaton are of a different generation. We are introduced to Tomeis Emma in a department store where she unsuccessfully attempts to swipe a broach.I have a problem with the storyline of Wildes Eleanor a struggling playwright. Shes enjoying an affair with a married man but doesnt want to show up for Christmas solo lest she let down Mom and Dad. So she does what no one has ever done in real life but what is quite believable to Hollywood comedy makers She picks up a stranger in an airport bar and brings him home as a prop boyfriend. Hes a soldier played nondescriptly by Jake Lacy. He wears camouflage but it is Lacys blandness that makes him such a human void.The ersatz couple makes up a detailed story to make their ruse believable - and what are the lies we tell ourselves and others but the truths that we need?Nelson brings up important ideas about roles expectations and striving to stand out as children but then trying to blend in and conform as adults. Unfortunately her messages come with shameless tricks of cuteness - too many cutaways to the family dog Rags and a maternity ward full of babies in crocheted Christmas wear.Its a Wonderful Life is a frightening tale about greed growing up abandoning ones dreams and feeling trapped. The assertion of the films title could be seen as sarcastic. Love the Coopers concerns itself with the loss of ones self specifically when it comes to parents who become so involved with raising a family that their individualism and personal passions are suppressed. ""You became smaller"" Goodmans Sam tells his wife.Where Its a Wonderful Life has a dark edge to its drama Love the Coopers tries too hard to be loved with a happy ending that is never really in doubt. Thats not life - thats Hollywood. How wonderful.

Photo Suzanne Tenner/CBS Films/Lionsgate via AP MOVIE REVIEW Love the Coopers Running time 107 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity adult themes sexuality). Unemployment dementia shoplifting estrangement and generalized anomie ""Love the Coopers"" is a Christmas tree hung with grenades. A sort of low-serotonin ""Love Actually"" this comedy-drama explores the various depressions traumas and failures of an assortment of characters heading for the same Christmas dinner hosted by a feuding couple (Diane Keaton and John Goodman) who following what the wife hopes will be one last perfect Christmas are planning to split up right after the holidays. The other guests include a sage old movie buff (Alan Arkin) and the waitress (Amanda Seyfried) who serves him in a diner; a struggling progressive playwright (Olivia Wilde) and a conservative Christian soldier (Jake Lacy) she meets in a bar; a shoplifter (Marisa Tomei) who has an unexpectedly frank conversation with the cop (Anthony Mackie) who arrests her; a single dad (Ed Helms) whose family doesnt know he has lost his job; and batty old Aunt Fishy (June Squibb). Ed Helms (from left) Alan Arkin and John Goodman.Photo CBS Films and Lionsgate Written by Steven Rogers (""Hope Floats"" ""Stepmom"") the script is filled with acute character observations and hard-won wisdom An old lady remembers ""never considering she would ever be anything but young""; someone excuses an untruth by saying ""It wasnt a lie it was a wish."" Rogers is smart and funny about the unreasonable expectations and perennial frustrations of holiday gatherings where someone can for instance be 40 and remain ""the child"" of the family. Emma (Tomei) is jealous of her sister Charlottes (Keaton) purported contentment ""You could be happy licking an envelope"" she says unaware of the Chernobyl toxicity between Charlotte and Sam (Goodman) that wafts from a canceled vacation decades back. Unfortunately director Jessie Nelson (""I Am Sam"") gradually turns the script into marzipan. Nelson overplays the emotional moments deploys a talking dog and blunders with on-the-nose imagery such as (two) instances of people depicted via special effects as literally shattering; he should have stuck with the heartbreaking restraint of the several Bob Dylan songs such as ""Buckets of Rain"" on the soundtrack. Theres a reason Dylan didnt call it ""Buckets of Schmaltz.""

Photo Credit CBS Films / Suzanne Tenner advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A dysfunctional family gathers for the holidays. RATING PG-13CAST Diane Keaton Olivia Wilde Ed HelmsLENGTH 147PLAYING AT Area theatersBOTTOM LINE About as heartwarming as last years fruitcake HIGHLIGHTS Diane Keaton John Goodman head up strong castBut film is hurt by uneven tone and poor dialogue All happy families may be alike as Tolstoy said but the same unhappy family keeps appearing in different movies. Here they are again keeping secrets nursing grudges falling for strangers and learning lessons in ""Love the Coopers"" a Christmas-themed comedy-drama directed by Jessie Nelson (""I Am Sam"") from a script by Steven Rogers (""P.S. I Love You""). Nearly a dozen stars play members of the Cooper clan who reluctantly gather for Christmas in a generically snowy city. Diane Keaton and John Goodman play Charlotte and Sam who cant bear to tell their grown children about their impending divorce. After all Hank (Ed Helms) has just been laid off and Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) is an easily wounded soul despite her flinty facade. Meanwhile Charlottes sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) has been arrested for shoplifting by Officer Williams (Anthony Mackie) who has his own problems. We also get a teenager (Timothee Chalamet as Hanks angsty son) and at least one senior (June Squibb of ""Nebraska"" as doddering Aunt Fishy). advertisement | advertise on newsday The best of these actors could sell just about any script but this one presents challenges. The characters speak not in dialogue but in self-help prose (""You love at arms length"") and their motivations feel like writerly contrivances. The films uneven tone doesnt help It wavers between whimsical snarky and dopey. (Thanks to special effects characters literally ""shatter"" and ""explode."") The narration by Steve Martin is cornier than Karo syrup. Things brighten whenever oh-so-liberal Eleanor flirts with right-wing Army hunk Joe (a very good Jake Lacy); theirs is the one relationship worth rooting for. Conversely the generation-spanning romance between Grandpa Bucky (Alan Arkin 81) and young waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfried 29) is an embarrassment; the movie unwisely plays it for pathos not laughs. ""Love the Coopers"" isnt exactly loathsome but it certainly cant be called endearing. Its a crazy-quilt of hokey plots embroidered with mawkish platitudes -- the movie equivalent of an ugly sweater.

Comments Love the Coopers Video Rated PG-13  106 minutes  2015 In this big hunk of cheese Diane Keaton and John Goodman play a long-married couple on the verge of separation who bring their family together for one last Christmas. Ed Helms and Olivia Wilde play their grown children Marisa Tomei is Keatons sister and June Squibb and Alan Arkin are some dotty old relatives. Everyone has some embarrassing secret hes afraid to share with the group (Helms has been laid off Tomei has been caught shoplifting) but everything comes to light and they realize they all love each other anyway. The dialogue consists of sitcom-ready cliches and the characterizations are all one-dimensional but the cast do what they can to eke some charm out of the material. Jessie Nelson (I Am Sam) directed a script by Steven Rogers.

But even with such a talented ensemble Love The Coopers convoluted narrative and overreliance on Christmas cliches keeps it from sparking any real holiday magic. Charlotte (Keaton) and Sam (Goodman) head up the Cooper clan and despite their insistence on one last perfect Christmas with their family theyre on the brink of divorce having drifted apart after 40 years of marriage. Helms stars as their son Hank who after recently separating from his wife has not only lost his job as a photographer but now has to raise his three children on his own. His sister Eleanor (Wilde) is a failed playwright and shed rather kill time in the airport bar than spend an extra minute with her judgmental family. These narratives weave together over the course of Christmas Eve with divergent stories focusing on characters like Charlottes sister (Tomei) who spends her Christmas in the back of a squad car after shoplifting a brooch. Her arrest turns into a makeshift therapy session with the officer (Mackie) whos struggling with his closeted homosexuality. Charlottes father (Arkin) also strikes up a relationship with a young down-on-her-luck waitress (Seyfried) at the diner he frequents and while its (uncomfortably) unclear whether his feelings toward her are fatherly or romantic Arkin and Seyfried try their best to keep it from being too creepy. The most engaging story goes to Eleanor and after she starts up a conversation with a deploying soldier (Lacy) whos stranded at the airport she invites him to pose as her boyfriend and accompany her to Christmas dinner hoping to silence her overbearing parents. Wilde and Lacys chemistry keep their burgeoning relationship believable even as they struggle with lazy cliches Hes a good Christian and a Republican she only believes in ""the sound of Nina Simones voice."" Instead of letting the movies more emotional moments breathe overly explanatory narration by Steve Martin interrupts any moments of tenderness. And while its billed as a comedy drama there arent many laughs. The two biggest running gags -- that Hanks daughter (Blake Baumgartner) wont stop calling people a d-- and his teenage son (Timothee Chalamet) wont stop sloppily making out with his girlfriend -- werent that funny the first time. Better to stick to the Christmas classics.

One is a funny trombone sound - WAH-waaah - on the soundtrack. Another is Rob Schneider in the credits. The worst though is when some human does something silly and the director cuts to a dog for a reaction shot. ""Love the Coopers"" not only does this three times it has the dog narrate the whole thing. As overloaded as the conference table at your offices potluck ""Love the Coopers"" - and no I wont - stars Diane Keaton and John Goodman as a 40-years-married couple busily preparing for their annual Christmas Eve dinner. Of course all the grown kids and aged relatives will be coming. Of course theyre all bringing problems (not least of all Keaton and Goodman who have decided - for not very clear reasons - to break up). Of course less than midway through you will give up caring about any of them. There are just too many characters frankly and most of them are bores. In a way the whole thing is kind of like a bad holiday party where youre a stranger getting introduced to everyone all at once. Wait is Ed Helms supposed to be Marisa Tomeis brother or her nephew? And how is Tomei old enough to be Keatons sister? The math doesnt make sense. And the fact that I was thinking about math during a comedy tells you a lot. Keaton is as effortlessly charming as ever as is Goodman - you really wish you were seeing them for dinner. (I bet he tells great jokes and she makes terrific popovers.) And Olivia Wilde is at least interesting as their edgy quirky daughter. But the rest of the movie is just a mess of cheap gags about senile old ladies and pimply young teens strung together with the kind of holiday music they used to put on Starbucks CDs. Hardly anything happens and when it does it takes forever. A warning ""Love the Coopers"" is the kind of movie that lies in wait for you patiently. The day after Thanksgiving when you are getting very weary of listening to Uncle Wingnut and Grandma Grumbles you will pick up the paper and see an ad for it. You will forget this review. You will think ""Hey what a great cast Lets all go see Love the Coopers"" Go into the kitchen. Make another turkey sandwich. Lie down on the couch until the urge passes. Ratings note The film contains strong language and mild violence. Love the Coopers (PG-13) CBS Films (107 min.) Directed by Jessie Nelson. With Diane Keaton John Goodman Amanda Seyfried Marisa Tomei.

Credit Suzanne Tenner/CBS Films Classic Christmas movies have a magic that cant be manufactured but ""Love the Coopers"" desperately tries to do just that. It employs a familiar conceit -- dysfunctional family gathers for holiday meal -- and enlists recognizable actors to deliver it but the result plays like a collection of ideas and jokes borrowed from other movies. The film is occasionally amusing but rarely feels genuine.Diane Keaton and John Goodman are Charlotte and Sam a long-married couple waiting for their extended family to arrive for the big meal at which they intend to announce that theyre separating. We see the various family members making their way toward the gathering. Theres the son (Ed Helms) with the broken marriage jobless and adrift. Theres Charlottes sister (Marisa Tomei) who is arrested while trying to shoplift a Christmas present. Theres a grandson (Timothee Chalamet) in the throes of romantic infatuation.The thread that comes closest to being absorbing is played out by Olivia Wilde and Jake Lacy whose characters do an opposites-attract dance after meeting at the airport. But the film written by Steven Rogers and directed by Jessie Nelson is too obviously manipulative. Its shameless appropriation doesnt help. There is for instance a folksy narration straight out of ""A Christmas Story"" which is also raided for its dogs-disrupt-dinner-plans gag.""Love the Coopers"" wants to be as beloved as that movie and several others that it calls to mind but its overwrought exchanges (especially between Charlotte and Sam) and efforts to push every emotional button in sight make it tedious not tenderhearted.""Love the Coopers"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for grown-up themes and a smattering of strong language.

(SUZANNE TENNER / CBS Films)Molly Eichel Inquirer Staff WriterPosted November 14 2015Sometimes Christmas with the family is not all snowflakes and sugar cookies but its worth sucking it up through the barbed comments and mini-disasters to do it anyway. Thats the overarching message behind Love the Coopers an early (even pre-Thanksgiving) entry in the Christmas-movie genre.The film concerns four generations of the Cooper family who all have some kind of secret. At the center are Charlotte (Diane Keaton who also played a matriarch in the similarly sniping griping The Family Stone) and Sam (John Goodman) who are headed for a separation after 40 years but dont want to ruin the holidays by telling their kids.Their older son Hank (Ed Helms) is a divorcA(c)e with three kids who doesnt want to admit to his family that his job taking family photos has been outsourced to a computer. Their daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) is cynical and guarded. Her idea of a good time is persuading a soldier named Joe (Jake Lacy) whom she meets at an airport bar to pretend to be her boyfriend.Then theres Charlottes dad Bucky (Alan Arkin) who feels closer to the waitress at his favorite diner (Amanda Seyfried) than he does to either Charlotte or her sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) but doesnt know how to tell her.Love the Coopers revels in the unhappiness and tension at play around the heightened expectations of the holidays - so often glossed over in favor of sweetness and light in Christmas movies. We expect so much during the holidays but perhaps happiness has been right in front of us the whole time.Its an interesting approach to look behind the faux sheen of joy that some families insist on at this time of year. But the movie itself veers messily and the plots threads are disjointed. Emma has a detour with a cop (Anthony Mackie whose talents are totally wasted playing someone who has token-character-of-color written all over him) after a shoplifting incident that once it comes to a close is never spoken of again.Sometimes the movie can be too nasty. This is supposed to be a dramedy - Steve Martin narrates with a lovely ""A Visit From St. Nicholas"" rhythm to his voice. But watching people be miserable with each other for the movies run-time does not always make for a pleasant experience.meichelphillynews.com215-854-5909mollyeichel Love the Coopers  (Out of four stars) Directed by Jessie Nelson.

Clockwise from left in ""Love the Coopers"" Amanda Seyfried Jake Lacy Olivia Wilde Maxwell Simkins Blake Baumgartner John Goodman Ed Helms Alan Arkin Diane Keaton and Alex Borstein (back to camera). (Suzanne Tenner / Lionsgate) Robert Abele In the fractured-family holiday movie ""Love the Coopers"" hackneyed humor and warmed-over life lessons are strewn like so much overused tinsel.Christmas dinner hosts Charlotte (Diane Keaton) and Sam (John Goodman) their senile aunt (June Squibb) in tow havent told their soon-to-be-visiting kids -- unloved playwright Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) and out-of-work divorcee Hank (Ed Helms) -- that theyre separating. Charlottes envious sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) meanwhile gets caught shoplifting for a Christmas present. Shes arrested by a cop (Anthony Mackie) who needs mothering. And irascible Cooper patriarch Bucky (Alan Arkin) is upset that his favorite diner waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfried) the daughter he wishes he had is quitting. And hey why not make Ruby the girl Hank once pined for from afar and Hanks ex (Alex Borstein) a harridan who spits food when she eats? Love the Coopers | Trailer Watch the trailer for the film ""Love the Coopers."" Watch the trailer for the film ""Love the Coopers."" See more videos The celebrity soup that is ""Love the Coopers"" is indeed a mess the kind in which the screenplay by Steven Rogers -- cramming in teenage first love closeted homosexuality old-age flatulence a swearing grandchild and more -- is made more chaotic by Jessie Nelsons tonally smeary direction. The frenzied first part that cross-cuts among the dread-filled Cooper clan is so haphazardly shot and edited it takes half the movie to assess whos who. Only Wildes airport story line in which Eleanor persuades a cute Army-guy stranger (Jake Lacy) to be her fake boyfriend has a frisson of romantic-comic appeal despite making little sense. A big irritant is that the film is over-narrated. (The voice is Steve Martins.) It explains everybodys eccentricities and baggage (""Aware of the growing distance between her parents ..."") at the same time the actors are frantically trying to show us. Occasionally a humiliated character actually breaks apart on screen because CGI apparently clarifies all. When Arkin gives a spirited heartfelt pep talk to Seyfried not only does the narration tell us Bucky feels youthful again -- because why trust a great actor to convey that? -- but also the filmmakers go so far as to replace Arkin briefly with a younger actor. This is a movie that would give you a wrapped present and say ""Its a wallet. It holds money.""

Theyre not the only ones with troubled lives. Everyone has problems and everyones feelings motives conflicts and yearnings are explained in advance by an omnipotent narrator (whose identity is a silly surprise).

Love the Coopers missing more than a comma review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLove the Coopers missing more than a comma review Love the Coopers has plenty of stars and an overstuffed plot but cant refresh the tired old home-for-the-holidays movie.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Nov. 12 2015Love the CoopersStarring Diane Keaton John Goodman Olivia Wilde Ed Helms Marisa Tomei Alan Arkin Amanda Seyfried Jake Lacy and June Squibb. Directed by Jessie Nelson. 107 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGBig fat fluffy flakes of snow fall relentlessly in Love the Coopers but little seems to accumulate.Likewise the busy story of multiple members of the Cooper family gathering for what could be a last communal Christmas Eve. Theres a lot there but it doesnt stick.Article Continued BelowHollywoods ghost of Christmas movies past revisits the multiplex each year for an annual dose of fractured family comedy with a cast of familiar faces. Writer Steven Rogers (Stepmom) and director Jessie Nelson (I Am Sam) seem initially to be trying a new tack. For one thing Robert De Niro is absent from the lineup. Fleet Foxes and Nina Simone have replaced Bing Crosby on the soundtrack. And all is not jolly in the Cooper family. There is disappointment and some bleak and cynical exchanges. Love the Coopers takes a look at a dysfunctional family around the holidays.  (eOne)  Thats refreshing -- until its not. Soon Love the Coopers becomes awkward and just as phony as the merry and bright stuff its trying so hard not to be.Steve Martin provides the Garrison Keillor-like narration as the family dog Rags. He gets all the good lines. Among the humans dialogue spawns speeches that take on the tone of lectures about missed opportunities and lousy attitudes. Fractured couple Charlotte (Diane Keaton) and Sam (John Goodman) admit their 40-year marriage is in tatters (something to do with her fixation on the kids and his missed trip to Africa). They vow to put on brave faces for their extended family before the bust-up.Its a challenge. Son Hank (Ed Helms) is an unemployed mall portrait photographer split from a boorish wife (Alex Borstein) and father of three including a wee girl who spouts an unfunny dirty rejoinder to everyone she meets.Meanwhile failed playwright daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde handling the best storyline with charm) is hiding out in an airport bar to avoid going home. She flirts with Joe a Marine on leave (Jake Lacy) insults him about his politics and convinces him to come home with her to play her fiance thereby deflecting her mothers perpetual disappointment.Grandpa Bucky (Alan Arkin) has a strange relationship with cafe waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfried). Charlottes angry younger sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) gets busted for shoplifting but uses her time in a squad car to psychoanalyze Anthony Mackies icy cop character.And dont forget June Squibbs Aunt Fishy who provides addlebrained comic relief.Taking its title from Charlottes Christmas card signature Love the Coopers is missing a comma and it turns out quite a bit else.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Turns out a lot VPCJessie Nelsons would-be comedy about a family coming home for Christmas Eve dinner is an unqualified mess wasting a terrific cast including Diane Keaton John Goodman and Alan Arkin among others.""Love The Coopers"" follows a fairly dysfunctional family at Christmas-time.(Photo CBS Films)Story HighlightsCritics rating 1 star out of 5The story is cliched and ridiculous a real disappointment with this castJessie Nelson directs it like a Hallmark card which is a cliche which is the pointWhat a waste bored Christians going after Starbucks for its non-denominational holiday cups in another battle of the trumped-up ""War on Christmas.""Save your breath people and your energy. Then direct it at ""Love the Coopers"" the feel-bad holiday would-be hit of the season. The film wastes a cast that includes Diane Keaton Alan Arkin John Goodman Olivia Wilde Marisa Tomei and Amanda Seyfried among others. Thats the real crime against Christmas.Thats when the film is set with far-flung members of the Cooper family coming home one last time for the Christmas Eve meal that Charlotte (Keaton) prepares every year. Only no one but Charlotte and her husband Sam (Goodman) know its going to be the last one. They secretly plan to divorce as staleness has overtaken their marriage going back to a never-taken trip to Africa. Sam wants to tell everyone because what says Merry Christmas like your parents splitting up? But Charlotte wants to keep things as normal as possible until the holiday is over.Of course in a movie like this ""normal"" is a foreign concept. Dysfunction runs through this bunch like flu. Or maybe dysentery is a better way to put it.AZCENTRALDiane Keaton talks about Love the Coopers and her new brand of wineIn addition to Charlotte and Sam their son Hank (Ed Helms) is having some problems of his own not limited to his oldest son discovering girls. Their daughter Eleanor (Wilde) doesnt want to disappoint them yet again so she grabs a soldier (Jake Lacey) having a drink in the airport bar on his way to be deployed and convinces him to be her boyfriend for the evening. Charlottes sister Emma (Tomei) is just kind of a mess who winds up in the back of a police car counseling a closeted cop (Anthony Mackie) -- and yes it is as ridiculous and unlikely as that sounds.Grandfather Bucky (Arkin) meanwhile is distraught that his favorite waitress Ruby (Seyfried) is leaving and after he discovers a darker side to her life he invites her to dinner. And for good measure Aunt Fishy (yes) played by the delightful June Squibb gets to take the night off from the retirement home and spend it with this bunch.Lucky her.Director Jessie Nelson shoots it all like a Hallmark card that comes to life which sounds like a cliche which it is which is the point. The script by Steven Rogers doesnt give her much to work with really unless youre a sucker for that old comedy standby blaming dinner-table flatulence on the dog.AZCENTRALLove the Coopers (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsHa Comedy There is some of that here supposedly. And love and happiness and finding the true meaning of Christmas and family finding it and finding it until like that fifth piece of pumpkin pie chased with a corresponding number of eggnogs you think youre going to throw up.This is a terrific cast but its dispiriting to see them put through these paces. Nothing seems genuinely felt. Goodman is a live-wire delight as a sleazy movie executive in ""Trumbo."" Here in comparison hes sleepwalking. Heck not even in comparison. Wilde is a terrific actress; Keaton a legend. What are they doing here?The checks cash the same for a classic or a clunker I suppose. Maybe the ones they cash for ""Love the Coopers"" will buy a nice Christmas gift. Someone should be happy at the holidays.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Please.Modern holiday films hit a new low with this trite and predictable dramedy (1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; in theaters Friday) that buries its few bright spots under a heap of fruitcakes. True most Christmas flicks tend toward the trite and predictable naturally but they just dont have to be quite this insufferable.Director Jessie Nelson (I Am Sam) juggles various interweaving story lines involving four generations of the Cooper clan in Pittsburgh. Sam (John Goodman) and Charlotte (Diane Keaton) are going caroling readying to host the big annual family get-together but also preparing to perhaps split up.Oh but there are plenty of other complications before everybody sits down to dinner.Sam and Charlottes unemployed mall-photographer son Hank is keeping his lack-of-job status on the downlow from his kids and soon-to-be ex (Alex Borstein). The familys elder statesman Bucky (Alan Arkin) lives for visiting his favorite waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfriend) though shes about to head off for Hot Coffee Miss. (which is an actual place). Charlottes younger sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) gets busted for shoplifting and is arrested by a stoic cop (Anthony Mackie). And Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) who understandably is hiding out at the airport avoiding her mom Charlotte and the rest of these nuts meets cute soldier Joe (Jake Lacy) and enlists him to be her pretend boyfriend before he gets deployed.Featuring Steve Martin as the narrator trying desperately to make sense of all this  Love the Coopers is the latest holiday-centric movie trying to be Love Actually with a litany of intertwining plots and high-profile actors to spare -- see also Valentines Day New Years Eve etc.And another bites the dust mostly this time because of humor that totally misses the mark. Most of the actors Goodman and Arkin especially deserve better but are hamstrung by Steven Rogers largely unfunny script. It has potential at times like in the slightly sweet relationship between Bucky and Ruby but often devolves to farting-dog gags a sex joke involving a popular Christmas carol and more awkward make-out sessions than your average junior prom.The silver lining in a movie like this with so many tales going is at least one will rise above the rest. In Coopers its that of Eleanor and Joe Right smack in the middle of a bad movie Wilde and Lacy have excellent chemistry as a woman unlucky in love and a guy nice enough to see that complete opposites attract.Theyre the anomaly though in a series of unfortunate events that leads to a Christmas-y conclusion. All the seasonal stereotypes are present and accounted for -- from Santas riding the subway to a dog wearing a sweater adorned with a Star of David -- and theres even a passing reference to Its a Wonderful Life a reminder of the holiday film you should have watched instead.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare What can go wrong when four generations of the Cooper clan come together for Christmas?

Its sort of a mashup of ""Home for the Holidays"" ""Love Actually"" and some minor Cameron Crowe movie thats sprawling awkward and contrived yet brimming with goodwill toward men. Diane Keaton and John Goodman play Charlotte and Sam a four-decade couple putting off divorce to fake one last perfect Yule for their imperfect clan. Their daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) a bitter liberal pill picks up a kindly right-wing GI named Joe (Jake Lacy) to take to Christmas dinner as her ersatz date because she cant bear the ""antici-pointment"" of waiting to see her moms judgmental disapproval over her brittle barren ways. Son Hank (Ed Helms) pretends hes got a job and contends with his coltish teen (Timothee Chalamet) and generic toddler (Blake Baumgartner) plus a middle kid with not enough to do in the movie (Maxwell Simkins). Also Read Will James Bonds Spectre Crush 3 Female Filmmakers at Box Office? Grandpa (Alan Arkin) a widower is crushing on a waitress (Amanda Seyfried) but not in a creepy way. Somehow its heartwarming. Aunt Fishy (June Squibb) has a mild case of dementia that just makes her sweet and happy. Poor Marisa Tomei seems as alienated as her character Keatons resentfully single sister trapped in a dead-end subplot with a troubled cop (Anthony Mackie) until she can make it to Christmas dinner. The narrator who seems to talk even more than Jean Shepherd in ""A Christmas Story"" is the Coopers dog Rags (Steve Martin in folksy mode). Rags may be a nod to the robot dog in Woody Allens ""Sleeper"" who also says things in excellent English and adds ""Woof Woof"" The screenplay by Steven Rogers (""Stepmom"") is a dogs breakfast a mess like one of the dishes Keaton serves her family a ""Dump Salad."" The vignettes sometimes resonate with the viewer but dont really connect into a plot there are too many characters with too many stories and pretty good flashbacks and some of the jokes are impossible to laugh out loud at unless youre a highly trained and paid actor. See Video War on Christmas Wrap Trends Even so these performers are the genuine article even when their dialogue is jive and Nelsons formidable niceness somehow powers us right through the longueurs to the touching and amusing parts of which there are many. Her over-obvious style contains subtle truths about the  romance of family. She works hard to make it so that every member has a sound point and is partly right no matter how appalling their critique of somebody else. Its formulaic but at least it hews in the direction of emotional realism. ""Love the Coopers"" does at least sound sensational with ""Little Miss Sunshine"" composer and DeVotchKa rocker Nick Urata aided by ""music archivist"" T-Bone Burnett who assembles a mix of Christmas carols old and new including ones by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss Fleet Foxes The Cats and the Fiddle and Bob Dylan.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Not every holiday-themed movie is a Christmas miracle. Many seem like gift paychecks to a cast doing their careers smallest work in Santa caps. And then there are inane lumps of coal like ""Love the Coopers."" If there is a TV news service seeking material for a ""War on Christmas"" freakout here is Villain No. 1. Tear-stained but upbeat without being persuasive in either direction this is the sort of trite kitsch-fest people see reluctantly out of duty to a visiting grandma. Watching this family get-together dramedy is like having a soldier-doll nutcracker crush your skull in its strong jaw. Maybe worse. An unseen narrator welcomes us to the upper-class New England home of Sam and Charlotte Cooper played by John Goodman and Diane Keaton (changing her name since she played an identical matriarch 10 years ago in ""The Family Stone""). Their postcard-pretty commercially devout community celebrates Christmas largely as a sales gimmick for the mall. To inspire expenditure the streets overflow with wreaths and snowmen sentimental music and rent-a-Santas; for laughable effect there are a tiny few neighbors in yarmulkes. Ha You see its funny because theyre Jewish. While the Coopers cover their lavish house with ornaments and take caroling trips to the local old folks home their year-end is really a time when they wrestle with domestic dysfunction. ""I want everyone to have the memory of a perfect Christmas"" says high-strung Charlotte. Her relationship to milquetoast Sam has been torpedoed by a long-running fight over a missed getaway vacation. While this looks to her like the couples last Christmas together she hopes that ideal gift packages and cranberry sauce will make this final celebration a happy smiling singing run-up to their farewell. Shes like a Martha Stewart clone who doesnt have the recipe for genuine warm emotions. Its a very faux Christmas. The argumentative relatives and friends filling the manse are played by a thick scrum of co-stars (Olivia Wilde Amanda Seyfried Marisa Tomei Ed Helms Alan Arkin June Squibb). Not one emerges as a clearly drawn recognizably human character though the actors have the ability to do that. All are solid veterans but the ""take my kin please"" tone of the script lacks consistent comic rhythm. love the coopers  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic elements language and some sexuality. Each and every character in Steven Rogers artificially wry screenplay sings precisely the same discordant note. Each chronically grouchy character has identical issues of troubled romance and loneliness regardless of age gender or personal background. No wonder they drive each other crazy. Sabotaging a smart tart cast that could do great work is a real shame. But the films worst stumble comes at the finale. In the years least believable denouement the ever-present narrators identity is revealed showing us a character who could never have viewed a fraction of the stories that he described. ""Love the Coopers"" is gift-wrapped rubbish. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

TWITTER 11/13/2015 Diane Keaton John Goodman Olivia Wilde and Amanda Seyfried headline Jessie Nelsons ensemble comedy about a troubled family getting together for Christmas. Now that awards season is upon us allow me to suggest a new category Most Extravagantly Wasted Cast. And the winner is ... Love the Coopers which squanders the likes of Diane Keaton John Goodman Marisa Tomei Alan Arkin Olivia Wilde June Squibb Amanda Seyfried and Anthony Mackie in a Christmas comedy of numbing tedium and tackiness. Some entries in the largely undistinguished dysfunctional-family-holiday-film subgenre -- The Family Stone (also with Keaton) and Jodie Fosters Home for the Holidays to name two -- are watchable despite their forced zaniness and predictable emotional beats; the spectacle of attractive stars packed into the frame to act out universal problems (meddling parents sibling rivalries unfulfilled romantic and professional lives) has its charms and comforts. But occasionally one of these movies comes along and in its total lack of wit and sincerity makes you feel like the ultimate Scrooge. Love the Coopers directed by Jessie Nelson (Corrina Corrina; I Am Sam) is such a movie. Red flags abound from the beginning as an off-screen narrator (Steve Martin) bombards us with cloyingly phrased background info on various members of the titular clan. Keaton (in full flibbertigibbet mode) and Goodman (looking half-awake) are Charlotte and Sam a 60ish Pittsburgh couple on the verge of separation but determined to have one last Christmas with their kids and grandkids. The two spend most of the film bickering over some trip they never took for some reason. Pardon the lack of specifics; it may be the dullest conjugal dispute ever committed to screen. Ed Helms (Vacation) plays their divorced and recently unemployed son Hank who has a few kids including a sullen teenage boy (Timothee Chalamet) and a mischievous 5-year-old girl (Blake Baumgartner). The former pursues a classmate and ends up kissing her repeatedly with far too much slobbery tongue; the latter has a vexing habit of exclaiming ""Youre such a dick"" at inopportune times. Neither of these running jokes is remotely funny. Wilde plays Charlotte and Sams daughter Eleanor whos beautiful smart and opinionated; in other words -- given the type of movie this is -- shes single. While waiting for her flight home Eleanor meets Joe (Jake Lacy of HBOs Girls) a boyishly handsome uniformed soldier whose toothy smile and square jaw help her get past the fact that hes a Republican. Tired of her mothers nagging her to date more Eleanor recruits Joe to accompany her to Christmas dinner and pretend to be her beau. Though it features one of Love the Coopers cringiest lines (when Joe asks Eleanor if she believes in God she replies ""I believe in the sound of Nina Simones voice"") Wildes is the only storyline that holds your interest. Thats probably because as she proved in Joe Swanbergs terrific Drinking Buddies the actress is a formidable onscreen flirt (all side-eye sass and veiled longing) and here brings much-needed vinegar to insipid material. The scenes of Eleanor and Joe also stand out as the only ones grounded in any sense of contemporary reality; she ribs him about climate change gun control and religion though of course their clashing values are no match for the filmmakers need to see Eleanor settle down. Meanwhile Tomei plays Emma Charlottes sister (dont even try doing the math) and easily the films least charitable creation. Childless husband-less needy and passive-aggressive Emma is also a shoplifter and ends up in the back of a police car driven by a closeted cop (Mackie saddled with a semi-insulting character). Shes envious of Charlottes seemingly perfect suburban existence but learns a valuable life lesson which as far as I could tell had something to do with the importance of buying expensive gifts for the people you love. Tomei is a superb actress and I trust will soon move on to better things. Finally theres Arkin as Charlotte and Emmas ailing father Bucky who spends his days at a diner bonding with one of the waitresses (a miscast Seyfried). His feelings for her are an uncomfortable mix of paternal and lecherous and the less said about their ill-conceived scenes together the better. Nelson and screenwriter Steven Rogers (P.S. I Love You) shuffle between these characters for an hour or so before everyone converges on the homestead for the big meal and attendant chaos. Things get marginally more entertaining at this point -- partly because June Squibb is on hand as Sams aunt and when all else fails an elderly persons flatulence and memory lapses are always good for an easy giggle. Love the Coopers certainly looks sleek enough (thanks to seasoned DP Eliot Davis) and Nelson trying hard to avoid the visual flatness of so many studio comedies directs with a rather aggressive touch. The result is a film cluttered with flashbacks flourishes of whimsy jittery close-ups used to signpost emotionally significant moments split-screen clips from black-and-white classics (a flash of George Cukors Born Yesterday serves as an unintentionally sadistic reminder that yes comedies can be funny) music ranging from holiday standards to Bob Dylan and cutesy character tics (example Hank snorts when he laughs). But none of those things can conceal the creative void at the movies heart or distract from its failure to make us feel anything for the stick figures onscreen. One scene toward the end in which Tomei and Keaton hash out their differences has a slightly sharper edge and a hint of something resembling real human emotion and theres a final twist concerning the narrators identity that earns a grudging smile. Still by then loving the Coopers will be out of the question; leaving them will be the priority.

(CBS Films) Review Not really loving the Coopers By Daniel Neman St. Louis Post-Dispatch Daniel Neman Nov 12 2015 (...) CBS Films John Goodman and Diane Keaton star in ""Love the Coopers."" (CBS Films) Most. Depressing. Christmas. Movie. Ever.""Love the Coopers"" is one of those holiday comedies about a big family that doesnt get along well but comes together at Christmas for a night of emotional turmoil and revelations before the inevitable uplifting ending.Of course it has an uplifting ending. Its a Christmas movie. But before the happiness begins we have to trudge through an unusually bleak quagmire of angst. We are treated to scenes upon scenes of bickering quarreling recriminations and sharp-edged analysis of selves and others. It should say something about the film that one of the least unhappy characters in it is the one who has attempted suicide.Diane Keaton heads the dysfunctional Cooper family (just as she did in ""The Family Stone"") with husband John Goodman and their marriage is shaky. Daughter Olivia Wilde believes she does not measure up to her parents expectations so she pretends a soldier (Jake Lacy) she meets at the airport is her boyfriend (just like Emily Hampshire in ""Hitched for the Holidays"").Recently divorced son Ed Helms lost his job (just like Holly Hunter in ""Home for the Holidays"") and is the father of two precocious children (just like every child in every holiday film ever).Marisa Tomei is caught shoplifting (just like Barbara Stanwyck in the underrated ""Remember the Night"") and connects with the cop who drives her around the streets of Pittsburgh for no good reason until dark. Tomei plays Keatons sister and although she is 19 years younger in real life there is supposed to be no more than three or four years between them. This fools no one. And the wise great-grandfather Alan Arkin has an emotional-but-not-romantic attachment to Amanda Seyfried a young waitress he sees every day at a diner (just like Keri Russell and Andy Griffith in ""Waitress"").We learn all of this rather than see it through an intrusive narrator who apparently doesnt trust the audience to make its own conclusions and who tends to say things like ""As she said the words aloud Emma remembered the time she first felt unremarkable."" Then we get yet another flashback.Writer Steven Rogers maintains his streak of gooey misfires -- he also wrote ""Hope Floats"" ""Stepmom"" and ""P.S. I Love You."" The often overly cute direction is by Jessie Nelson who not coincidentally wrote the Broadway musical version of ""Waitress"" which may explain the Arkin/Seyfried relationship. Of all the films mini-stories the pretend-boyfriend scenes with Wilde and Lacy work the best and even then they tend to be talky and long.The rest is worse.

Read the full review. Blue Sky Studios/Twentieth Century Fox Film Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. ""Love the Coopers"" is one of the most jumbled tonally misguided holiday movies in recent memory. It is an insult to tidings of comfort as well as joy and a complete waste of the time and talents of its ensemble cast. Seriously Santa Claus himself would walk out of the theater angry enough to wage his own war on Christmas. [The Holiday Movie Guide 12 films matched to every taste] There are a great many things wrong with this dysfunctional-family drama/rom-com but the biggest issue is one it shares with ""Love Actually"" ""Valentines Day"" and other holiday-focused ensemble pieces. ""Love the Coopers"" attempts to focus on too many characters making it impossible to invest in any of their stories or for that matter to even figure out exactly how all of these people are related to one another. Set on Christmas Eve and leading up to a family gathering the film introduces us to Sam and Charlotte Cooper (John Goodman and Diane Keaton) a couple married for 40 years who are planning to separate after one last Christmas with their family. Predictably this means they spend most of the movie arguing and asking ""What happened to us?"" Their son Hank (Ed Helms) a recently divorced dad is hiding the fact that he has lost his job as a photographer at Sears. (Hank snorts nervously a lot. This is supposed to be funny. Its not.) Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) whos eventually revealed to be Hanks unmarried sister meets a handsome soldier named Joe (Jake Lacy) at the airport and persuades him to come home with her on Christmas Eve and pretend to be her boyfriend. Meanwhile the story follows several other characters Charlottes sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) who engages in an impromptu therapy session with an emotionally stunted cop (Anthony Mackie) after he arrests her for shoplifting; Charlottes father Bucky (Alan Arkin) whos obsessed with an insecure young waitress (Amanda Seyfried); and Aunt Fishy (June Squibb) who suffers from memory loss and incontinence. The only thing missing is a partridge in a pear tree with commitment issues. So many things do not work ring true or even make sense. Emma for instance is portrayed as slightly younger than Charlotte even though Tomei is nearly 20 years younger than Keaton. Seyfrieds waitress isnt the least bit creeped out by Buckys interest in her. And Steve Martins narration overexplains everyones internal monologue. I can only assume the actor was being held hostage in a voice-over studio. Director Jessie Nelson (""I Am Sam"") and screenwriter Steven Rogers (""P.S. I Love You"") pile on the flashbacks dream sequences and other would-be whimsical flourishes. When Eleanor remembers seeing her fiance with another woman for example Martins narration informs us ""she was shattered"" as her character literally breaks into shards of glass. That approach further muddles the whiplash-inducing narrative. For a movie intended for families ""Love the Coopers"" contains a lot of tasteless humor. The least uproarious running gag involves the youngest granddaughters tendency to call people -- including her own grandparents -- a crude word that rhymes with ""stick."" Theres also a scene in which Hanks son Charlie (Timothee Chalamet) sloppily tongue-kisses his new girlfriend in front of multiple generations of Coopers while they sit in a hospital waiting room following a serious health scare. Theres so much tenderness in their eyes its as if their hearts are growing three sizes every time he licks the poor girls face. Even the most grating of holiday movies become almost tolerable when all the twinkling lights and snowflakes show up. But ""Love the Coopers"" is neither warm nor festive. In fact the picture was so dark at a recent screening that I wondered whether something was wrong with the print. (A rep for CBS Films said that he was aware of no problems.) By the time the credits roll some audience members may be uttering a phrase that starts with the letter ""F"" -- and I dont mean ""Fa la la la la."" Chaney is a freelance writer. PG-13.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A lot of talented actors must really want to make a Christmas movie. Or anyway the gamble that one of their films might become a perennial seasonal attraction on cable channels is the most expedient explanation for how Diane Keaton John Goodman Marisa Tomei Amanda Seyfried Anthony Mackie Olivia Wilde Jake Lacy Ed Helms Alan Arkin June Squibb and the voice of Steve Martin all find themselves in Love The Coopers a movie that should be punctuated like a Christmas card sign-off but instead losing a comma becomes an off-putting directive. How Robert De Niro didnt make it to this set is a mystery for the ages. The movie takes place on Christmas Eve as Charlotte (Keaton) and Sam (Goodman) prepare one final perfect Christmas for their family. The finality isnt due to illness (though viewers would not be wrong to suspect this given that some of these filmmakers had a hand in both The Family Stone and Stepmom) but the looming possibility that Charlotte and Sam will divorce an option theyre hiding from the rest of the family. Martin narrates introductions to all of the family members and related folks offering background information in second-rate but earnest prose reminiscent of a mainstream novel. Daughter Eleanor (Wilde) kills time in an airport where she meets Joe (Lacy) and confesses her trepidation over disappointing her parents; recently divorced son Hank (Helms) looks for work and worries about his kids; Charlottes father (Arkin) chats with a waitress (Seyfried) at his favorite diner; and Charlottes little sister (Tomei) has a run-in with a stoic cop (Mackie).Its all pretty ambitious for this type of movie--that is the type of movie premised on the notion of puncturing the oppressive good cheer of the holidays with irreverent sentiments that better show off all the complex messiness of real life and wind up feeling suspiciously like old-fashioned sap. Love The Coopers goes about this secret-sentiment business less cynically than some (its hijinks-heavy trailer is somewhat misleading) focusing on the characters collective bittersweet memories of past holiday experiences and driven by Martins head-hopping narrator. Martins voiceover narration for his own L.A. Story and Shopgirl does manage to make his material here sound more wry and wise than it really is. As a comedy-drama Coopers is almost completely without laughs which maims its ability to find the right balance of pathos and farce. But like the similarly unfunny and semi-heartfelt Keaton vehicle Because I Said So--co-written by director Jessie Nelson--it maintains a certain sincerity.How the filmmakers go about reaching for this sincerity and ambition however maintains a certain technical incompetence. Most of the first 75 of the movies 105 minutes consists of two-person dialogue scenes Goodman and Keaton; Wilde and Lacy; Seyfried and Arkin; and so on. Theyre simple set-ups and Nelson gooses most of them with awkward unnecessary flourishes. The camera bobs weaves and goes in close over-covering most of the conversations into distracting hashes. In a big scene between Seyfried and Arkin Nelson cuts between the two and while Arkin is shot from slightly below looking slightly to the side at his scene partner Seyfrieds half of the conversation is shot with her looking almost straight into the camera. That oddball trick with no discernible meaning is repeated later in a scene with Wilde and Lacy who at least get to share the frame a few times during their offbeat courtship before the movie cuts in and muffles their burgeoning romance with antsy shot choices.The Wilde/Lacy storyline still has its charms even though its simultaneously overwritten (in its wordy explications) and underwritten (to better contrast with Wilde Lacys character is identified as a Republican while stating absolutely no beliefs beyond a jokey disbelief in evolution); at least it offers the simple pleasure of watching two attractive people fall in love. The rest of the cast has less luck in their bids to create a believable family unit much less holiday immortality. There are small details to appreciate like the soundtrack that uses several non-holiday Bob Dylan tunes and opens the movie with ""White Winter Hymnal"" by Fleet Foxes rather than a holiday standard. Yet despite her ear for non-traditional Christmas tunes Nelson cant steer clear of cutesy kids who pronounce words with a soft ""r"" dog reaction shots (a staple of Keatons work these days) and the warm sentiment that melts everything together into a soppy mess by the wrap-up. In fact an insane impossible yet weirdly predictable final twist allows Love The Coopers to stake a claim not as a holiday classic but as the ultimate dog reaction shot in feature-length form.

"Love the Coopers You Wont | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Love the Coopers Nick Schager Film Critic nschager 16 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of CBS Films November 12 2015 | 0812AM PT This slushy holiday dramedy follows a familiar family-reunion template. Fittingly given that its title sounds like a demand ""Love the Coopers"" peddles holiday sorrow cheer and uplift with off-putting insistence. Director Jessie Nelsons dramedy follows a familiar family-reunion template in detailing the Yuletide get-together of the Coopers a clan fracturing under the weight of divorces unemployment unrealized dreams and loneliness -- as well as past joys that all its members desperately want to reclaim. Decked out in the usual tinsel-and-mistletoe trappings the film lurches awkwardly between gloominess and giddiness never hitting the boisterously bittersweet groove it seeks. Failing to carve out an identity distinct from its many subgenre predecessors this slushy feel-good saga faces a stormy theatrical forecast at best. Ten years after ""The Family Stone"" Diane Keaton again takes the lead of a contrived getting-the-relatives-back-together film that eventually employs the threat of tragedy as a device for familial reconciliation. Before ""Love the Coopers"" ventures down that misbegotten path however it first delineates the problems of its various interconnected players. Front and center are Charlotte (Keaton) and Sam (John Goodman) who after 40 years of marriage still dress in matching flannel outfits (hers in typical Keaton fashion buttoned to the top). Identical style choices aside however theyve grown so far apart that theyve agreed to separate -- a decision driven by Charlottes interest in fixating on her kids at the expense of Sams long-coveted trip to Africa. Their estrangement is also related to the fact that years earlier Charlotte and Sam lost a young child though its indicative of Steven Rogers scattershot and superficial script that said catastrophe is mentioned only in passing and seems a mere afterthought amid the more pressing crises at hand. Those involve Charlotte and Sams son Hank (Ed Helms) a despondent mall photographer who cant find a new job and is divorcing his wife Angie (Alex Borstein); and their daughter Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) a failed playwright whos carrying on an affair with a married man and would prefer to spend Christmas Eve anywhere other than at her parents house. At an airport bar she meets Joe (Jake Lacy) a young soldier whose religious Republicanism becomes the immediate butt of liberal Eleanors cringe-worthy jokes but whose earnest demeanor and big smile quickly prove irresistible. In no time Eleanor is introducing Joe to her own god (Nina Simone) and convincing him -- since a blizzard has grounded his deployment flight -- to come home with her and pose as her boyfriend. Meanwhile Charlottes sister Emma (Marisa Tomei) -- who ridiculously is meant to be only a few years Charlottes junior despite the actresses 19-year age difference -- is arrested for trying to shoplift a brooch in her mouth. In the back of the squad car of police officer Williams (Anthony Mackie) she sets about giving the ""robotic"" cop some therapist-y advice which causes Williams in one of the films innumerable implausible developments to open up about his homosexuality and the disapproving mother who drove him to live life in the closet. Williams is simply a mechanism designed to help Emma learn that shes not alone and moreover that she can turn herself into the person shes always wanted to be. That makes him about as one-dimensional as the memory-addled Aunt Fishy (June Squibb) who orbits the Coopers like a comic-relief clown programmed only to make funny faces at the dog and in the storys nadir to expel a rancid fart during Christmas dinner grace. If that werent enough Charlotte and Emmas father Bucky (Alan Arkin) is heartbroken when he learns that his favorite diner waitress Ruby (Amanda Seyfried) -- with whom he shares a platonic quasi-romantic relationship -- is intent on skipping town. Such news compels Bucky and Ruby to rail at each other with the same type of blunt-force honesty that characterizes Charlotte and Sams contentious rapport. Their no-holds-barred candor soon comes to typify just about every utterance heard in ""Love the Coopers"" including the constant narration provided by the family dog Rags (voiced by Steve Martin) which is so Hallmark-card corny that it sabotages any sense of emotional authenticity or maturity. An overstuffed turkey about shedding lies and embracing who you are and how you feel Nelsons film courts cheap nostalgic pathos via clips from ""City Lights"" and ""Born Yesterday."" It also intersperses its action with brief flashbacks to memories -- of carefree excitement of blissful togetherness of departed loved ones -- that continue to haunt these characters. When coupled with Charlotte and Sams ongoing discussion-cum-argument over how they drifted apart ""Love the Coopers"" occasionally appears on the verge of ditching its more cloying tendencies and transforming into a thoughtful meditation on how the holidays serve as a time to reflect on and reconnect with family love and those cherished people and moments (big and small) that once brought such happiness. Unfortunately Rogers tale is far less concerned with such issues than with tidily pairing off its forlorn single characters and reuniting its betrothed ones -- all of which comes about during a climax set at a hospital thats shameless in its heartstring tugging. In the process of advancing plot threads to their telegraphed conclusions the film strands its actors with little to do but bicker pout grin and swoon with metronomic predictability. Undermined by an unfocused story that can barely even tell us about these individuals deep-seated hang-ups much less adequately dramatize them Keaton Goodman Helms Wilde Arkin Seyfried Tomei and Mackie merely coast by on charisma. Similarly functional Elliot Davis sweeping camerawork around twinkling Christmas-decorated sets fails to energize the hectic proceedings while the soundtrack mixing Bob Dylan and Sting tunes with traditional seasonal classics would be right at home at a Starbucks.

Reply Gabriel says November 20 2015 at 1056 am You beat me to the punch with the Diane Keaton tie-in with ""The Family Stone"" I still love D.K. but it sadly looks as if she isnt even trying anymore. And poor John Goodman and Alan Arkin fared so much better in ""Argo"". Amanda Seyfried after the fiasco that was ""The Big Wedding"" (also with Keaton) I would think you would want to stay away from these ensemble trainwrecks. And poor June Squibb is saddled with the type of role that Shelley Winters used to play in her sleep. Oops I just yawned. Reply Mary says November 15 2015 at 444 pm The most boring movie The dialog is pathetic. I felt sorry for the actors who r all so talented that they went through this awful movie.

EntertainmentMovies Love the Coopers Family Christmas tale has some spirit Originally published November 12 2015 at 1205 am Updated November 12 2015 at 1101 am Jake Lacy and Olivia Wilde play strangers who pretend to be a couple at a family Christmas Eve gathering in ""Love the Coopers."" (CBS Films/TNS) Movie review of ""Love the Coopers"" Olivia Wilde and Jake Lacy save this comedy-drama about a family reunion on Christmas Eve. Rating 2.5 stars out of 4. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times Toward the end of ""Love the Coopers"" a character invokes the spirit of Christmas by mentioning Clarence the fussy angel from Frank Capras ""Its a Wonderful Life."" Its one of many references to other better movies. And its because of scenes like this that you forgive ""Love the Coopers"" for its shamelessness. It may be too ambitious for its own good it may be too willing to jerk tears but its heart is in the right place. True theres a lot to forgive in this comedy-drama about a quarreling couple (John Goodman Diane Keaton) who gather their clan and attempt to create a ""perfect"" Christmas Eve. Many flashbacks are used to suggest the impact of holiday-related childhood traumas. Movie Review 1/2   Love the Coopers with Olivia Wilde Jake Lacy John Goodman Diane Keaton Marisa Tomei. Directed by Jessie Nelson from a screenplay by Steven Rogers. 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and sexual references. Several theaters. The ghosts of Christmas pasts are everywhere and they threaten to drown the movie in psychobabble especially when a shoplifting daughter (Marisa Tomei) is analyzing her relationships. Its up to a young couple (Olivia Wilde Jake Lacy) to create a romantic charade that stays fresh and tense. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?
