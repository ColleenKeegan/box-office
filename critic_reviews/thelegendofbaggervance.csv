More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

Robert Redfords telling of a fictional 30s golf match is very much of a piece with his numerous previous films about the ""inner game"" in athletics and self-realization. ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" is a lightweight modestly engaging yarn sporting reductive mystical and philosophical elements that are both valid and borderline silly. Robert Redfords carefully mounted telling of a fictional 30s golf match between two real-life legends and a local Georgia champion is very much of a piece with his numerous previous films about the ""inner game"" in athletics competition and self-realization such as ""Downhill Racer"" ""The Natural"" ""Quiz Show"" ""A River Runs Through It"" and ""The Horse Whisperer."" But while the picture is involving enough on a moment-to-moment basis it generates no special excitement or feeling which is partly attributable to the relaxed nature of golf as well as to the simply defined characters. The up-to-now untarnished B.O. record amassed by Will Smith will be scuffed a bit with this DreamWorks/20th Century Fox co-venture which looks destined for just OK returns domestically and internationally. Steven Pressfields beguiling novel pivots on the curious master-student relationship that develops between Bagger Vance a deep-thinking guru who imposes himself as a caddie and Rannulph Junuh a long-ago rising star of the links who pulls himself out a decade-long bender to take on golf titans Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen in a special match. Alluding to past lives dating back 20000 years and ever-ready with nuggets of Eastern wisdom that serve to correlate golf and ""the game of life"" Vance in the course of an intensely played 36 holes guides his protege toward the discovery of his Authentic Swing the pure and natural expression of any persons game personality and soul. Fortunately Redford and screenwriter Jeremy Leven (""Don Juan DeMarco"") have lightened the helpings of Vances philosophizing just as they have added a long-standing romance between Junuh and the beautiful society woman who stages the contest. But they have also cut back on one of the books primary sources of fascination its detailing of how the game is played. Even for non-fans Pressfields description of players strategic planning how they size up a hole assess risks and judge their own abilities is riveting much in the manner of accounts of military operations. The camera could easily have capitalized upon this strength but the competition is shown in a mostly generalized way. Narrated from the vantage point of many decades by an old man (Jack Lemmon) who suffers a heart attack on a scrubby golf course and remembers back to a resonant event of his youth story proper is set in the early stage of the Depression. Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron) the golden girl of Savannah faces a mountain of debts left in the wake of the suicide of her once-wealthy father who also passed along a fabulous new oceanside golf resort. To put Krewe Island on the map Adele charms the two leading golfers of the day Atlanta gent Jones and swaggering Yankee Hagen into a one-on-one 10000 competition a stunt that local businessmen will only consent to if one of their own is permitted to play as well. The only conceivable man for the honor is mid-1910s amateur champ Junuh (Matt Damon) who disappeared for a decade from Savannah and the still-bitter Adeles life after suffering Great War battle trauma and is now a drunken no-account living outside town. With difficulty hes persuaded to get a shave and shape up; among the films best scenes are one in which Junuh tells the idolatrous 10-year-old narrator-to-be Hardy Greaves (a captivating J. Michael Moncrief) how alcohol slowly kills different parts of the brain and another in which Adele comes to seduce Junuh into participating in the match with Hardy pretending to sleep across the room. The detailing of some of the early sequences recalls ""Quiz Show"" in its analytical portraiture of a rarefied strata of American life. As Junuh shoots practice drives one night a mysterious figure emerges from the darkness and after ingratiating himself starts giving pointers and alluding to the Authentic Swing. Thus does Bagger Vance (Smith) become Junuhs caddie and unsolicited spiritual guide with Hardy shortly added as advance caddie. The two-day match commences nearly an hour into the film and one is struck at once by the different figures cut by the players then and now. Hagen (Bruce McGill) is a flamboyant dandy driven to the course in a massive convertible by his swami-like caddie while Jones (Joel Gretsch) is the picture of a blond god distinguished by an easy-going Old World manner. All three golfers are dressed impeccably in suits and ties and even the members of the gallery however dire their financial situations are decorously accoutered. After just a few holes Junuh has fallen embarrassingly behind and Vance is on his case with all manner of mumbo jumbo about how he has to envision the whole ""field"" how the perfect shot will choose him rather than the other way around how he has to ""remember"" rather than ""learn"" the Authentic Swing. As simplistic and satire-inspiring as all this stuff may be its also just as legitimate as equivalent truisms in other sports and in the arts such as finding le mot juste in writing or Ernst Lubitschs insight into cinema that theres always one perfect place to put the camera. Simply put those inclined to scoff will find plenty of motivation to do so but others able to admit the essential truth of cliches will have no trouble sticking with the story. So far out of it after the first day that hes given virtually no chance of recovering Junuh somehow absorbs Vances wisdom and stages a miraculous comeback on the third round. Themes of honor fair play and self-validation are all invoked as the match reaches its final two holes after which the principals just sort of fade away except in the mind of old Hardy. With his quasi-historical/religious/mystical roots minimized and the invented relationship between Junuh and Adele pushed forward Bagger Vance becomes more of a peripheral figure than he was in the book indispensable thematically but more obviously a bystander when physicalized as a rather shabbily dressed fellow who mostly hangs around delivering advice while others perform. Role provides Smith with a perfectly sympathetic opportunity for a change of pace one he handles agreeably while seeming to tax his abilities not in the least. In a role Redford at one time considered playing himself and for which he then almost used Brad Pitt Damon adequately essays one of the many flawed Golden Boys who populate the actor-directors pictures; young star nicely conveys the smart lucidity beneath the hero-gone-south of the early going but bleaches out somewhat when forced to react vaguely to Vances many pronouncements and in comparison to Gretschs utterly dazzling Bobby Jones the real Golden Boy here. Who is this Joel Gretsch and how could an actor with looks like his not have been discovered by Hollywood before now? As with Junuh there isnt much depth to Therons Adele; no clue is offered as to how she dealt with Junuhs 10-year abandonment of her aside from her still being livid and Theron while looking great hasnt entirely nailed her Georgia accent and seems ill at ease at times. McGill is a delight at the swaggering Hagen while the roles of the sports reporters have been cut down to virtually nothing compared with the book. Pic is physically immaculate in the manner customary with Redfords work with Michael Ballhaus lensing giving luster to the evocation of period notably achieved by Stuart Craigs production design Judianna Makovskys costumes and the Savannah and South Carolina locations. Rachel Portmans score and numerous vintage tunes blend to good effect.

Starring Will Smith Matt Damon and Charlize Theron. Directed by Robert Redford. (Rated PG-13. 127 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Robert Redford can put attentive viewers into such a trance of high-mindedness that they might even want to rush out and see a better movie. In the meantime they could do a lot worse than the directors ""The Legend of Bagger Vance."" Redfords golf digest -- it dont mean a thing if it aint got that swing -- taps right into the American mythology of self-improvement. It covers the turf where classic American values meet inspirational salesmanship which may come to the same thing. Get a grip. Im not about to knock it. The movie is about the great game of life and fortunately a lot of it takes place on the golf course. Redford may have no particular interest in golf but he does have a particular interest in the great game of directing -- or as Bagger Vance would put it getting out of the way and letting the authentic shot find him. A number of those shots have found Redford who has his own bag of tricks. The competition sequences on the golf links with the splendid camera work of Michael Ballhaus and exactly the right amount of digital tweaking are the real revelations of this film. Will Smith as Bagger Vance strolls in out of the darkness in the nick of time carrying a suitcase and a lot of other baggage most of it of the knowing- smile-in-the-face-of-adversity kind. Its not long before he will trade the suitcase for a caddies golf bag. He will follow a demoralized former champion played by Matt Damon onto the green where they will encounter real-life golf greats Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. Fictional characters show up in our real lives all the time -- Ive been thinking a lot about Charles Foster Kane lately -- so why not real people in our fiction? It didnt do ""Ragtime"" any harm. The narrative spoken by an uncredited Jack Lemmon as a folksy old duffer often tells us what is going to happen and exactly what it means and then the movie dutifully illustrates it. Even so and in an inspirational fable like this one a viewer must take a lot on faith. The World War I trench fighting that traumatized Rannulph Junuh (Damon) is so perfunctory that it might as well have come out of our collective imagination. Junuhs resulting dissolute life appears to be nothing worse than sitting around playing cards with guys in undershirts having a drink and (gasp) smoking. (Smoking even in the 20s apparently equals moral rot. Keep an eye out for another major character who smokes.) Thank God for Charlize Theron and golf not necessarily in that order. Old codger Lemmon is not really our guide into the film. Theron is. The picture doesnt start to come alive until she starts winding men around her lil ol finger. Theres a will of steel beneath that genteel if arch Southern accent. The action takes place in Savannah Ga. where Adele (Theron) the daughter of a resort owner who went under in the post-war Depression comes up with the idea for a money-making exhibition golf match with Jones Hagen and local boy Junuh who 12 years previously dumped her and life in general when he got back shell-shocked from the war. Smith is a shrewd choice for the otherworldly Bagger Vance. You might say the actor is touched by an angel. Guardian angels these days are about as uncool and unhip as you can get which plays directly to Smiths own cool. After the nonchalant Bagger teaches Junuh to find his ""authentic swing"" there is a ""Who was that masked man?"" quality to Smiths exit. The golf matches -- with the players in elegant knickers sweaters and neckties -- are what this movie is all about. These scenes were filmed at the Jekyll Island Club in Georgia the Pete Dye Course in South Carolina and the Ocean Course at Kiawah Island S.C. where a new 18th hole was constructed for the final showdown. Golf legend Jones (Joel Gretsch) full of gentlemanly aplomb but hawk-eyed nonetheless and the swaggering Hagen (Bruce McGill) are presented as archetypes of masculinity. ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"" points out that golf works on the honor system and is the only game where a player can call a penalty on himself. If thats the case is it fair to have an advantage when youve got heavenly intervention? Just asking. -- Advisory This film contains one four-letter word. ..

Posted November 13 2000 -- 1200 AM EST Its the rare sports movie thats actually just about sport and The Legend of Bagger Vance is the usual thing a male oriented self serious bedtime story about a man for whom a game involving holes and a small ball represents nothing less than the meaning of life. Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) from Savannah Ga. is a handsome swain whose extraordinary talent on the links is shot to hell by World War I. Battle has shattered his nerves as well as his engagement to Adele (Charlize Theron) a swan-like Savannah belle. As envisioned in Steven Pressfields novel and adapted by Jeremy Leven Junuh comes home a wreck and might have squandered the rest of his life drinking in juke joints but for an amazing confluence of events Number one Adele trying to promote the resort she inherited from her father in the depths of the Great Depression organizes an exhibition golf match featuring the games (real life) ranking gentleman star Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and its biggest showman Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill) for which the city burghers demand the inclusion of a local player. Number two Junuh is visited by a mysterious guardian angel who calls himself Bagger Vance and offers to caddy. But this is no ordinary schlepper. While he shoulders the clubs he imparts Chicken Soup for the Golfers Soul advice to Junuh (You lost yo swang; we gotta go fahnd it""; ""Everyones got one true authentic swang"") with a righteousness made tolerable only because Vance is played by the authentically likable Will Smith. The similarity between Smiths role and that of Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile is conversation for a different dinner party; suffice it to say theyre both Magical Negroes put on earth to help white folk. Whats of greater interest -- maybe for white folk -- is how this par for the course fable with its heros journey from despair to triumph to hubris and back to faith fits in with myths of American manhood that enchant the director of Bagger Vance Robert Redford. Let Kevin Costner shrug and sweet talk in a Tin Cup world of rumpled middle aged boys; Redfords eye is on a much higher birdie a vision out of The Natural. The directors gold-lit world the same universe in which A River Runs Through It isnt just about fly fishing and The Horse Whisperer isnt just about equine stress reduction relies on a ritualized filmmaking style that leaches his story of excitement. (Redfords golf metaphors are to Al Gore as Costners are to George W. Bush.) Theres not a moment in Bagger Vance that cant be anticipated from the birds in flight above a verdant golf course to the look in Adeles eyes as she falls in love with Junuh all over again. Theron alternates a slow pouring drawl with the gestures of a headstrong designing woman; Damon flashes his disarming smile of Hollywood noblesse Smith grins with multimillion dollar humility. ""Come out of the shadows"" Vance coaxes Junuh who loses a ball in the dark woods. But for useful tips on what iron to use youre on your own.
