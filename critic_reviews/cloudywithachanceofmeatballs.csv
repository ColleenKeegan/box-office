In a random act of kindness the town hairdresser agrees to foster him on weekends. Video courtesy of Sundance Selects. By Joe Morgenstern March 15 2012 613 p.m. ET Some movies capture your interest in the first scene. ""The Kid With a Bike"" in subtitled French grabs you in the first few seconds and never lets go. A boy holds a phone listening intently. Hang up a man standing next to him says the numbers not in service but he refuses. When the man tries to take the phone from him he reacts with the ferocity of a wild animal who has just been cornered. The boy Cyril has been trying to phone his father from a state-run residential facility thats become his permanent home since his father disappeared. Almost instantly we intuit the kids plight. Cyril has been abandoned but he refuses to acknowledge it or to let go of his fervent love for a parent who doesnt deserve him. Thats the way things happen in movies made by the Dardenne brothers Jean-Pierre and Luc. They cut to the quick as well as the chase with surgical skill and unstressed compassion. ENLARGE Cecile de France and Thomas Doret in The Kid With a Bike. Sundance Selects The plain-wrapper title bespeaks a luminous minimalism; the image is familiar but it begs to be filled out. The bike has disappeared too though it soon turns up again both as a symbol of the boys blind faith--he cant believe that his father would have sold it--and the vehicle of Cyrils journey from angry isolation through moral peril to understanding and newfound love. As in all of the Dardennes films theres the sense of a soul at risk and a central performance of exceptional power. I cant imagine how they directed their sweet-faced towheaded young actor Thomas Doret to express such a startling range of emotions. Whats on screen though is a memorable portrait of a tough and tender kid who wont take no for an answer until a local hairdresser Samantha gives him a home and brings him around to saying yes. (Shes played with lovely simplicity by Cecile De France.) But why does Samantha do it? Exactly what in her back story or in the coils of her psyche explains her willingness to take in a kid she hardly knows? Im asking this only to emphasize how Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne choose to work. Its the sort of question that filmmakers must routinely contend with when theyre making big-budget films for movie studios where production executives are obsessed with explaining motivations because they dont trust audiences to understand on their own. The Dardenne brothers shoot small films in their native Belgium on modest budgets and they dont explain they show. Instead of serving up psychological banalities they dramatize pivotal moments--quietly astonishing moments--in which people make decisions often impulsively that change the course of lives. In Samanthas case she decides to be kind just like that although it should be said that Cyril has already decided just like that to let her know that hes open to her attentions. Lest this sound sentimental be assured that it is not; if only a little love were enough to transform the kids life with no further complications. But its very much in keeping with the brothers earlier films many of which are about the possibility of kindness. In my favorite until now the 1996 ""The Promise"" Jeremie Renier is 15-year-old Igor the blank-faced long-haired son of a vile father who traffics in illegal immigrants. When one of them suffers what is clearly a fatal injury on a construction site the dying man implores Igor to take care of his wife and children. The boy listens apparently unmoved but then nods almost imperceptibly and impulsively mumbles a fateful phrase ""I promise you."" That film might have been called ""The Kid With a Conscience."" In ""The Kid With a Bike"" Mr. Renier plays Cyrils father whos not so much vile as obtuse and hopelessly selfish. Its anguishing to see his indifference to the son who needs him desperately but anguish is far outweighed by the rewards of watching a story in which bonds of trust are severed only to be replaced by new ones. Working on a scale thats minuscule by studio standards the Dardenne brothers have made yet another movie that does what Hollywood used to do--keep us rapt and leave us grateful. Boy Five years ago Taika Waititi a New Zealander of mixed Maori-European ancestry made ""Eagle vs. Shark"" an endearingly odd romantic comedy. His new film ""Boy"" is no less odd but its also super-exuberant and super-affecting thanks to the pairing of James Rolleston as the boy of the title and the filmmaker as his father. Watch a clip of ""Boy"". Set on the east coast of New Zealand in the year 1984 Boy an 11-year-old kid and devout Michael Jackson fan gets a chance to know his father who has returned to find a bag of money he buried years ago. Video courtesy of Paladin. The time is 1984 and the setting is a poor Maori community on tribal lands in the unspoiled East Cape region of New Zealands North Island. Its the town where Mr. Waititi grew up and the only trace of another culture in his film comes when a column of white cyclists suddenly whizzes across a bridge and promptly vanishes. Boy an 11-year-old who idolizes Michael Jackson lives in a ramshackle house with his younger brother Rocky and several cousins. (Boys given name which he shares with his father is Alamein a reference to the World War II battle where a Maori battalion fought with allied forces.) The siblings mother is dead their father hasnt been seen for years and the grandmother who cares for them has gone out of town for a funeral. Suddenly Alamein senior shows up with a couple of buddies and an assortment of presents in the trunk of his car. Far from being a repentant parent on the upswing let alone the shining hero of Boys imaginings the father is a goony stoner shameless prevaricator and scuzzy crook who has come home to dig up a bag of money that hed buried years ago in a nearby field. ENLARGE Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu James Rolleston and Taika Waititi in Boy. Unison Films Mr. Waititi a popular standup comic in New Zealand is wonderfully droll and entertaining in this acting role which isnt all that far geography and culture notwithstanding from Steve Zahn at his stoner best. As a director of actors hes exceptionally good with his young star--your heart goes out to Boy when he does awkward approximations of Michael Jackson moves to impress a girl named Chardonnay--and also with Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu who plays the tender and imaginative Rocky. As a filmmaker Mr. Waititi makes good use of a seemingly casual anything-goes style; some scenes are punctuated by spasms of magic realism and studiedly naive animation. And the movie has been beautifully photographed by Adam Clark even though listening to it can be problematic--the accents are strong and the young nonprofessional actors sometimes fall into piping singsong speech patterns. For all its jovial trappings however ""Boy"" is a comedy with a serious core. Its another case of a son having clung to an idealized notion of his father and in a stunning climax and an exquisite coda coming of age as he comes to grips with wounding truths. 21 Jump Street A pair of underachieving cops are sent back to a local high school to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring. Video courtesy of Columbia Pictures. ENLARGE Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street. Sony Pictures This cheerfully chaotic gleefully vulgar action-comedy retread of the old television series has box-office success written all over it and wheres the harm? Its irresistibly funny until it isnt. The resistible parts are mainly the action sequences though theres a good running joke about big explosions that dont happen until one does. The most agreeable parts turn on the unlikely affection that grows between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as screw-up cops and reluctant buddies who are manifestly unqualified for the undercover work theyre assigned to do. Their assignment as fans of the series may recall requires them to pass for high-school students; in this version theyre searching the school for users and distributors of a new drug. Mr. Hill might pass on a day without sunshine in a classroom without lights but Mr. Tatum could well be mistaken for a teacher or parent a situation Michael Bacalls clever script addresses frequently by noting its patent absurdity. The script is particularly smart in contrasting what used to be cool back in the day when the two men were bona fide high-school students and whats cool in the more sophisticated here and now. (Johnny Depp who starred in the original series is neither forgotten nor entirely gone.) ""21 Jump Street"" was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller and is dominated in a pleasantly understated way by Mr. Tatum who has the school smarts--as distinct from street smarts--to underplay his role whenever possible. Ice Cubes nasty police captain on the other hand would be consistently over the top if the movie had a top to be over. Jeff Who Lives at Home Dispatched from his basement room on an errand for his mother slacker Jeff might discover his destiny (finally) when he spends the day with his brother as he tracks his possibly adulterous wife. Video courtesy of Paramount Vantage. Before I say anything nice about this short and semisweet feature by Jay Duplass and Mark Duplass--its a big week for filmmaker brothers--I want to go on record as being highly resistant to fey contrivance glib poignancy and almost all things concerning man-child pothead slackers who pass their days on sofas not growing up. That might seem a perfect description of this film; its very title constitutes a poignancy alert. Surprisingly though most of the material avoids the treacle zone while Jason Segel as the man-child in residence gives a performance that I can only describe as gravely affecting. An obsessive admirer of the M. Night Shyamalan film ""Signs"" Jeff keeps looking for signs to answer the existential question haunting us all What am I supposed to do? The signs he sees however are so inscrutable and his reactions so bizarre that his mother Sharon (Susan Sarandon) and his brother Pat (Ed Helms) have all but written him off as a participant in what passes for real life. Yet they have their problems too the most infuriating being Pats epic insensitivity to the needs of his wife Linda (a fine performance by Judy Greer). Compared with Pat Jeff comes off as only mildly disadvantaged in the clarity department. ""I cant help wonder about my fate"" he says ""my destiny."" I couldnt help caring about him. DVD Focus ENLARGE Rosetta (1999) Much darker than ""The Kid With a Bike this Dardenne brothers drama has for its heroine a stocky girl of Italian extraction; she is played by 18-year-old Emilie Dequenne in a remarkable film debut. Rosetta lives with her drunken mother in a Belgian trailer park suffers terribly from an unspecified internal upset and yearns with all her heart to have a regular job and a normal life. Usually hostile and sometimes rageful Rosetta pursues her narrow goals quite ruthlessly while the movie keeps questioning tacitly the moral choices that she makes to escape from intolerable circumstances. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs (2009) Phil Lord and Chris Miller directed this animated feature and adapted the script from the childrens book by Judi and Ron Barrett. The story explores the question of why rainfall in a certain small town has been replaced by foodfall. (Global warming isnt the answer.) Those who dislike the film focus on its ludicrous premise. Those who admire it do so because it remains true to its ludicrous premise. The voice cast includes Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan Benjamin Bratt Neil Patrick Harris and Al Roker who knows a thing or two about the secrets of the skies. Baghead (2008) Very short and amiably scruffy this comedy-thriller by Jay and Mark Duplass starts with a couple of marginally talented young actors who figure that anyone can make a movie so they will too. The movie they try to make is a horror story about a man with a bag over his head. The movie the Duplass brothers have made is a parody of indie films with special reference to ""The Blair Witch Project"" as well as a horror-ish entertainment with a silly-ish payoff. Among the members of the engaging cast are Steve Zissis Ross Partridge Greta Gerwig and Elise Muller.

The imagery takes a jarring Cronenberg-esque turn (puckered sphincters and squirming intestinal prolapses) in the last reel.

(Sony Pictures Animation) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday September 17 2009 429 PM Title Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs Unless youre on your way to Disney World by way of Hersheypark ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" is very likely the most fun your family will have this month.Mischievously expanding on Judi and Ron Barretts popular book writerdirectors Phil Lord and Chris Miller introduce us to a depressed fishing town called Swallow. Their hero is Flint Lockwood (voiced by ""SNLs"" Bill Hader) an accident-prone inventor who baffles his blue-collar dad (James Caan) and infuriates the local police officer (Mr. T).Flints latest experiment happens to be pretty cool a machine that transforms water into food. Unfortunately he gives the contraption an oversized power surge that sends it into the clouds over Swallow.His mistake turns out to be cause for celebration at least at first. Townspeople and tourists start lining up to place orders and soon its raining pancakes in the morning hot dogs for lunch and banana splits at night. Best of all Flint is finally popular; he even has his first girlfriend (Anna Faris). But the towns greed grows as big as its collective waistline and eventually somebodys got to pay the check.The 3-D animation isnt groundbreaking but Lord and Miller sneak visual jokes into every corner of the screen. They do the same with their witty script which will leave both kids and parents delighted. In fact despite the tide of sensible lessons young viewers will be too busy laughing to realize theyre also learning.So what could be better than an endless supply of jellybeans and ice cream? Only a multiplex permanently stocked with smart sweetly silly family films like this one.

Anna Faris is the voice of Sam Sparks left and  Bill Hader voices Flint Lockwood in ""Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs."" Photo Columbia | Sony Pictures Animation Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Its being sold to the masses as a childrens movie based on a beloved old picture book -- all quippy dialogue zippy 3-D animation and madcap action with a dash of romance. In truth Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is a dead-serious piece of activist filmmaking. A cautionary tale about gluttony obesity and genetically modified food the movie transforms Judi and Ron Barretts ink-drawn tale of edible precipitation into some kind of IMAX aversion therapy for popcorn-snarfing movie goers. In a word gross. If the fountain of cheese sauce doesnt get you the blimp-size meatball will -- and thats before it sprays giant foodstuffs from its butt. After that you have to make it past the roast headless chicken who swallows a guy in a diaper (voiced by Andy Samberg no less). It takes an iron stomach to watch this stuff and not feel nauseated. Someone should put it on a triple bill with Super Size Me and Food Inc. two other appetite-killing tirades against nasty American eating habits. This particular example of the genre stars Bill Hader as the voice of Flint a misunderstood Medusa-haired inventor obsessed with sardines. As a boy Flint invented spray-on shoes; as a young man his feet still encased in translucent rubber he devises a rocket-shaped microwaving gizmo that mutates water into food. Inconveniently the machine goes ballistic during a test run atomizing a brand-new theme park (Sardine Land) and putting Flint on the outs with the mayor (Bruce Campbell). That is until his Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator starts affecting the weather. First a pickle slice falls like a raindrop. Then a storm front dumps a hailstorm of cheeseburgers -- juicy ones with sesame buns and lettuce. So begins in the words of Anna Faris chirpy weather reporter ""the greatest weather phenomenon in history."" But what starts as manna from heaven -- and waffles and falafel and jelly beans -- quickly turns into a sloppy Pharaonic plague as the food gets fatter the storms get rougher and young Flint rebuffs his humble father (James Caan gravelly and delicious) for the hollow glories of fame. In restyling the Barretts work co-directors and co-writers Phil Lord and Chris Miller havent so much adapted it as altered its DNA. The book didnt have much in the way of a moral. Or characters. Or plot. Nor did it have much to say about pigginess or waste its eco-minded townsfolk being careful to compost. Those familiar with the original will however spot a few direct visual references the palace in orange Jell-O the schoolhouse flattened by a giant pancake the roofless restaurant where meals simply drop from the sky. Whats missing is any and all magic. Sure modern technology means filmmakers can now crash a mutated BLT into the Eiffel Tower but that doesnt mean they should. That doesnt mean every whim that crosses someones brain needs to be realized in IMAX. ""I mean bigger is better right?"" So says Flint.

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Sep. 17 2009 447PM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs Written and directed by Chris Miller and Phil Lord Featuring the voices of Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan Andy Samberg and Mr. T Classification PG Any 3-D animated film featuring a mile-high spaghetti cyclone is going to interest little kids. Especially if the film throws in a painless pun with every meatball. For example ""Its sardine to get better"" in Sardine Falls. And for 20 minutes or so Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs  which is based on the popular 1978 kids book by Judi and Ron Barrett is great fun. One thing is sure No comedy has a more promisingly ludicrous set up. Hidden under the ""t"" on the map of the Atlantic Ocean Sardine Falls is a one-flavour island. Kids parents everyone eats sardines for breakfast lunch and dinner. Flint Lockwoods dad hopes that one day Flint will run the family sardine bait shop. But Flint (voiced by Bill Hader) has other fish to fry. Hes an inventor who hopes to diversify his towns food options. To that end he has built an invention that turns Sardine Falls other great resource - water - into hamburgers. Soon hes pointing his gadget at the clouds and dialling up storms of steak and ice cream. (Parents will be pleased to know that an occasional vegetable also drops from the sky.) Eventually Flint becomes a hero drawing the attention of a ditzy blond weathergirl Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris). Too soon however the animated film loses its sense of the ridiculous. We know things are sardine to go wrong when Flint and his dad begin fighting over the boys irresponsible nature - and the film is on the dads side Then it turns out Sam is actually a brilliant meteorologist who plays dumb to get a network job. Theres also a dreary subplot involving a kindly cop (a perpetually shouting Mr. T) and his cutie-pie son. No comedy should come bogged down with so many Important Life Lessons. Older kids tweenagers who came of age watching The Simpsons or Family Guy  wont sit still for cartoon family values. And adult guardians certainly wont find any fun in Flint and Sams tediously chaste relationship. (As if characters like Hader and Faris whose credits include Superbad and The House Bunny  could have ever entered into such a dull union in real life.) So what Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs leaves us with is sporadic showers of laughs for kids under 10. Thats a shame because the film could have been a delight for everyone if only it hadnt learned to behave. As it is the film feels like a zany spitball fight that comes to a sobering conclusion when the principal enters the room.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Any movie based on a childrens picture-book is bound to be a feat of extrapolation but taking on ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs poses a special challenge. The 1978 book has a funny concept - a town called Chewandswallow where the food supply falls from the sky - but no characters and little plot to speak of. Food drops in ever more destructive weather patterns but no one questions why.So the new 3-D animated movie version essentially starts from scratch. We get a tiny island town called Swallow Falls which lives well off the sardine trade until global sardine demand takes a serious downturn. And we get a protagonist a nerdy young inventor named Flint Lockwood (the voice of Bill Hader) who is misunderstood by his father Tim a bait-and-tackle shop owner voiced with endearing gruffness by James Caan. Flint decides to save the town from depression by inventing a machine that converts water into food and when his gizmo somehow winds up suspended in the sky - just dont think about it too much - it starts raining cheeseburgers hot dogs and any other food that Tim orders from his computer.At first this is good for everyone particularly an aspiring weather girl named Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) the towns gluttonous mayor (Bruce Campbell) and the kids who get to enjoy a morning snowfall of ice cream. But the people get greedy the portions get too large - theres a message about obesity here but thankfully it isnt pushed too hard - and the machine now overworked starts going haywire.The most impressive thing about this film is the vibrancy of its world created by Phil Lord and Chris Miller veterans of the animated TV series ""Clone High. The characters are carefully drawn in the metaphoric sense and cast with the obligatory hipster cred Andy Samberg plays ""Baby Brent a grown-up slacker whos still sponging off his fame as an infant sardine mascot; Mr. T plays a police officer who does acrobatics in short shorts; and Neil Patrick Harris provides the voice of Flints sidekick a monkey named Steve.There are occasional references to the book a roofless restaurant a pancake that falls atop a school an enormous orange Jell-O mold. But whats striking for any devotee of the print version is how little this looks like the book. Ron Barretts detailed illustrations are distinctive and unique but the movie arrives in a familiar glossy style that makes the characters all look like bug-eyed plastic action figures. Thats not to say it isnt beautiful at times especially during scenes involving water or Jell-O. And the animators have great fun with the fake-fur look of Tims bushy eyebrows and mustache.Still its all very Hollywood appealing but derivative inspired by the likes of ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids and every disaster movie ever made. As such it might be a little scary for the smallest kids who wont take well to the concept of a giant ear of corn rolling toward them in 3-D. For everyone else its engaging perhaps a little too frenetic and full of the expected lessons about being yourself and expressing your love. Its not especially filling but it leaves a pleasant aftertaste.Joanna Weiss can be reached at weissglobe.com (c) Copyright 2009 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Freely adapted from the 1978 childrens book by Judi and Ron Barrett the new animated movie Cloudy With A Chance Of Meatballs feels like a warning from another era. A parable about the perils of living amid abundance it arrives at a moment when even Sesame Street has had to address the seemingly endless economic recession. Hey message already received the hard way. Of course kids probably wont mind. And if theyre lucky they may even get a chance to appreciate its warning about the dark side of easy living. It also helps that the film co-directed and co-scripted by first-time feature-makers Phil Lord and Chris Miller doesnt get too bogged down with moralizing. It flits swiftly between easy-but-funny sight gags involving giant food send-ups of disaster-film cliches and endearing characters brought vividly to life by a pleasing visual style plus funny vocal performances from Bill Hader Anna Faris Bruce Campbell and Mr. T. Hader plays a hapless geek with a lifelong gift for building inventions that almost work. His luck changes--and with it the luck of his island town whose sardine-based economy has been hit hard by the revelation that as one headline puts it ""Sardines Are Super Gross""--when he unveils a machine that makes the sky rain whatever food he chooses. But the tremendous gift works largely to make his fellow citizens lazy and it leaves Hader no happier than before even with the arrival of a pretty weather reporter (Faris) who shares some of his nerdy obsessions. Between dispensing lessons about the important of staying industrious and the kids-movie staple of staying true to yourself Meatballs focuses on clever gags--some involving a monkey with a voice translator that only reveals the shallowness of his interests others featuring Andy Samberg as a man whos spent his whole life coasting on once having served as a sardine companys adorable baby mascot--and some surprisingly touching stuff with Haders inexpressive uncomprehending dad (James Caan). Its a brisk bright winning effort even though it already looks sadly out of touch with the times.

Well Judi and Ron Barrett didnt tell you in their 1978 childrens book Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. But it turns out in a 3-D film thats more or less an animated ""origins"" story that a teen inventor named Flint Lockwood is responsible. When Flint (voiced by a very funny Bill Hader) was an adolescent he invented lots of things that didnt work quite the way hed hoped spray-on shoes that he couldnt take off or a remote-controlled TV with legs that came to you when you wanted to change the channel except that it often wandered out the door instead. By the time he was in his teens hed come up with a monkey thought-translator for his pet monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris) which wouldve proved more useful if monkeys had more complicated thoughts. Then there were the rat-birds which... well rat-birds just arent a very good idea. Still his latest invention -- a machine that turns water into food -- seems to have possibilities even if Flints unibrowed dad (James Caan) cant see them. Alas an extra jolt of electricity sends the machine rocketing past Sam (Anna Faris) a cute weather forecaster on her very first broadcast and into the stratosphere before Flint can figure out whether it actually works. He gets his answer when a pickle falls from the sky followed by cheese followed by a storm of cheeseburgers. The machine not only works but once Flint learns to control it he can take special requests from soup to nuts. Which makes him pretty popular -- and doesnt hurt the weather forecasters career either; shes fond of puns and starts talking about ""meatier showers."" Thats just a taste -- sorry puns are all but unavoidable with this picture -- of the scripts wit. Filmmakers Phil Lord and Chris Miller also make amusingly sharp visual jokes from the child-inflected lab in Flints backyard (its airlock is a painted shower curtain its instruments repurposed toys) to a veritable feast of food metaphors Jell-O as trampoline a twisting tornado of spaghetti an avalanche of sherbet. (The animators have the good sense to realize that if it were ever to snow ice cream kids would almost certainly make snow angels lying face down.) i Better Than A Snow Day Theres plenty of high-fructose sweetness as orange juice and ice cream fall from the sky. But the filmmakers also hint at the serious real-world issue of overabundance in a society that loves to consume. Sony Pictures Animation hide caption toggle caption Sony Pictures Animation Better Than A Snow Day Theres plenty of high-fructose sweetness as orange juice and ice cream fall from the sky. But the filmmakers also hint at the serious real-world issue of overabundance in a society that loves to consume. Sony Pictures Animation All of which could easily turn sickly sweet so its nice that the film brings some real-world crunch to the story -- ethnic characters whose presence make a social point a weathergirl smart enough to bridle at being dismissed as eye candy and a clear message about the downside of a society where food is overabundant. Like most mainstream pictures these days Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs ends with a big action sequence turning into Raiders of the Lost Arbys when you wish it would serve up something less conventional. But by that time the filmmakers have also served up a little food for thought along with a lot of laughs.

Sony Picturess Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs may not scale the artistic heights of a Finding Nemo or Wall-E but its the most satisfying and original non-Pixar CG animated movie to hit screens in a while.On a remote island principality in the mid-Atlantic the populace have been living on sardines since the canned-fish market dried up. So plucky young scientist Flint Lockwood inventor of overactive hair-unbalder and spray-on shoes (which you can never remove) commits himself to solving the problem. His answer is a machine which turns water into food creating anything from sliced pizza to ice cream with toppings. Its a success - until a freak accident happens the machine goes berserk and it starts to rain cheeseburgers.The makers of the film are not remotely interested in pop-culture references or celebrity cameos the voice cast favours stalwarts like Anna Faris and James Caan over inappropriate A-listers. Banishing such petty distractions frees director Phil Lord to focus on more important issues like story and character the plot is wonderfully twisty building to an eyeball-frazzling culinary climax of truly epic proportions. The characters are equally well drawn from self-absorbed overambitious doofus Flint to his expressionless but somehow heartbreaking sad-sack dad Tim. But the films greatest pleasure - and the element that sets it apart from its smarmy in-jokey predecessors - is its bizarre sense of humour. Fusing snappy one-liners with a kid-friendly seam of slapstick incorporating everything from talking monkeys to homicidal Gummi Bears the script provokes comparison with comedy from The Marx Brothers to The Mighty Boosh. This sense of unpredictability coupled with some breathlessly paced and visually stunning action scenes makes this the animated success of 2009... at least until Up opens next month.

CLOUDY With a Chance of Meat balls"" doesnt lack for ideas. Its the Food Network meets The Weather Channel meets . . . the Scary Doomsday Preachers Channel. The animated movie greatly expands on the kids book on which its based in a clever and engaging first half. But the second half leaves a foul aftertaste. Slapdash action scenes play against dreary warnings to fear wealth and beauty. Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader) is a genial young genius whose inventions always go wrong. The latest is a machine that converts water to food. Although ridiculed by the townsfolk (Mr. T makes a funny contribution) he could save his decaying island home whose only industry is sardines. Things go bonkers and the gizmo winds up in the clouds raining food on the delighted town. A foxy weather girl (Anna Faris) hurries to the scene ""My forecast Sunny Side up"" Flint ignores the warnings of his humble dad (voice of James Caan looks of G. Gordon Liddy). Dad is poor -- he spends his days grinding sardines into chum at his bait shop. Hes also verbally inept technologically illiterate and stuck in the past -- and hes the voice of reason. Hes the only one who sees the aporkalypse coming. The island has an environmental problem (excess food goes to a dump that threatens to overflow) and people are getting obese. Dad wants Flint to save the day by shutting down his machine. But that would plunge the island back into rusty destitution. The town problem isnt complacency or greed -- its just growth. When steaks the size of Priuses rain down the fathers point is proved The population is being buried by its own prosperity and the solution is not to manage the resources but to cut them off. Why not export the surplus and get rich? Because then thered be no message about our collective guilt. Its telling that the gadgets in the film are relics from the 1970s and 80s (loved the use of the old Simon electronic party game). The movie is a high-tech celebration of Luddism not because the filmmaking digerati are actually nostalgic for low tech themselves but because they think it like poverty and ugliness suits the sweaty throngs out beyond the 310 area code who are messing up the planet. The Faris character a secret brainiac who is beautiful at the start is aggressively unattractive in the second half because ugliness were told is more real. Now were knocking on the doors of the Puritans and the Taliban with their warnings against prettiness. Because no kid movie is complete without a global-warming message the comedy turns into ""The Day After Tomorrow"" plus marinara sauce. The breakneck battle scenes the repetitive slapstick (one guy slips into the body of a giant chicken another into a giant olive) and the wordplay (""What if weve bitten off more than we can chew?"") dont drown out the lecturing ""This mess were in is all our fault."" Hang on -- its morally wrong to try to produce an answer to the islands poverty? The movie is as clueless as Marie Antoinette. The peasants are eating too much cake.

"Cloudy with a chance of meatballs Leaves you hungry for more | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesCloudy with a chance of meatballs Leaves you hungry for moreHungry for some good old family-friendly entertainment? Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs should fit the bill of fare.Wannabe inventor Flint Lockwood in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs.  (SUPPLIED IMAGE)  By Bruce DeMaraEntertainment ReporterFri. Sept. 18 2009Voices Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan Mr. T. Directed by Phil Lord Chris Miller. Written by Jodi Barrett. 98 minutes. In major theatres. PG Hungry for some good old family-friendly entertainment? Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs should fit the bill of fare.Based on the book by Jodi Barrett Cloudy gets the full Hollywood 3-D treatment courtesy of Sony Animation.Loaded with empty calories its nonetheless breezy fun that if nothing else is likely to dramatically boost concession sales at participating theatres.Our young hero Flint Lockwood longs to be an inventor on par with Alexander Graham Bell and Nikola Tesla.Article Continued Below But his early efforts - a hair restorer rat-bird hybrids and spray-on shoes (that wont come off) etc. - lead to more ridicule than acclaim from his peers.""Have you ever felt you were a little bit different?"" young Flint wonders aloud a not particularly deep or original thought as it relates to childrens entertainment. But hey did we mention its in 3-D?Flints ambitions rise as he grows into young adulthood to the development of a machine that converts water into food.A good drenching of cheeseburgers on the beleaguered town of Swallow Falls ignites the mayors hopes for a new industry to replace sardine fishing and brings a young weatherperson/love interest to the island to meet Flint.But the experimental machine soon develops ambitions of its own which include raining giant cobs of corn down on the Great Wall of China splashing a Dennys-style big breakfast over the Eiffel Tower and such unexpectedly dangerous weather phenomena as a spaghetti tornado and a pea-soup fog.Silly? Oh yeah.But what redeems this kids movie is the humour permeating throughout. To wit lines like ""You may have seen a meteor shower but youve never seen a meatier shower."" Theres a particularly idyllic scene following an ice cream storm where the kids do their snow angels facedown.All kinds of junk food rains from the sky including pizza roast chickens and donuts none of it of the calorie-conscious variety.But Cloudy isnt a movie intended to nourish budding brains - other than the hoary lesson about ""being different"" being good sandwiched in without much subtlety - its about fun and make-believe with a hint of redemption that has enough comedy and wit to amuse children and adults alike. And the 3-D animation makes every moment of every scene come alive with all the clarity and vivacity of a super-charged sugar high.So by all means dig in. Just dont be surprised if you come out with the raging case of the munchies.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

GOLDSEPT. 17 2009 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Sam Sparks left and Flint Lockwood characters in ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."" Credit Sony Pictures In a year in which Hollywoods 3-D animated films have seemed to set the genius of Pixars ""Up"" against the dubious best of everything else the impulse to take a break from computer-generated family fare is understandable. (Any urge to see ""Ice Age Dawn of the Dinosaurs"" again? I thought not.) But then youd miss ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" which takes its title and premise from the 1978 childrens book by Judi and Ron Barrett about a place where all types of chow rain down like manna.Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) has been mocked since childhood for his failed inventions. His machine that converts water into menu items seems to offer redemption as well as a way to score points with a cute weather girl (Anna Faris) until of course the technology runs amok and a perfect storm of the four food groups threatens his town and beyond.This first animated feature by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who cut their animation teeth writing the short-lived ""Clone High"" on MTV spins a predictable tale of youthful ambition love and the quest for approval yet without leaving a sappy or snarky aftertaste. (Fathers for example dont always know best but sometimes they do.) Parents will enjoy tracking the endless stream of movie and television sendups. If the filmmakers opt to make only light statements about junk food obesity and solid waste they at least leave the audience sated on a single serving of inspired lunacy.""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" is rated PG (parental guidance suggested) presumably for its spaghetti twister and feral Gummi bears.CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLSOpens on Friday nationwide. Directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller; written by Mr. Lord and Mr. Miller based on the book written by Judi Barrett and illustrated by Ron Barrett; edited by Robert Fisher Jr.; music by Mark Mothersbaugh; production designer Justin K.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint LOVE HAPPENS  out of four stars Rating PG-13 for language sexual references Burke (Aaron Eckhart) is a widowed psychologist whose bestseller about dealing with loss has made him a celebrity bereavement guru. While running a seminar in Seattle he meets Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) a florist who stirs his emotions for the first time since his wifes death. To complain that ""Love Happens"" is a routine Hollywood romance is like protesting that Nilla Wafers have a cookie-cutter similarity. Eckhart has the meatier role as a half-healed trauma coach whos morose offstage but infomercial-excited in the spotlight. Eckhart is good at suggesting dark moody notes beneath a charming veneer; more of those touches would have made Burke compelling. Anistons performance is surprisingly guarded. Their chemistry hovers around the ""good friends"" level with little romantic ardor. ""Love Happens"" is technically slick with gorgeous Seattle locations handsomely photographed. The problem comes in the telling. Was it really necessary to stop the movie halfway through for a featurette-length Home Depot commercial? The dramatic hook of the story involves a secret that any viewer can see a mile off. The film is a harmless time-waster that could have been more. COLIN COVERT THE BEACHES OF AGNEs  out of four stars Rating Not rated; brief nudity. Subtitled. Where Edina. To see this film is to fall in love with its creator and subject 81-year-old auteur Agnes Varda ""a little old lady pleasantly plump and talkative"" in her own modest description. Varda was present at the birth of the French New Wave and still makes films with more brio and imagination than most professionals a third her age. ""Beaches"" is a chipper colorful film essay about her life her career and friendships with the bad boys of French filmmaking including her late husband ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" director Jacques Demy. Varda made fiery feminist films in the 70s but was too independent-minded to be confined to the womens-film ghetto. She opens her heart to one and all from the bakers who are her next-door neighbors in France to her unlikely Hollywood pal Zalman King soft-core sovereign of the ""Red Shoe Diaries."" Her autobiography overflows with passages of Fellini-esque beauty as she films a trapeze troupe against the sea as well as skits of surreal silliness. When was the last time you saw a world-renowned director converse with a cartoon cat or dress as a potato? COLIN COVERT Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs  out of four stars Rating PG; mild language This computer-animated 3D extravaganza is the ultimate food fight capitalizing on the universal compulsion to play with your food. But like any good food fight it offers short-lived entertainment. Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) is a brilliant but misguided inventor who has the best intentions but the worst ideas. When the town of Chewandswallow falls on tough times he is committed to liberating everyone from their daily diet of sardines. A harebrained machine that converts water into any food goes haywire destroys half the town and launches into the sky. Its deemed yet another Flint Lockwood failure until -- whadda ya know -- it starts raining cheeseburgers The town is smitten and Flint is a hero. Gluttony and thoughtlessness prevail as Flint preoccupied by his newfound fame and beautiful weathergirl Sam unwittingly unleashes a worldwide food tempest. Based on the much loved (and gentler) book by Judi and Ron Barrett ""Cloudy"" takes the premise and goes as out of control as Flints food machine. A self-proclaimed ""film made by a lot of people"" it relies too heavily on CGI and quick laughs to give much more than momentary enjoyment. KATHIE SMITH THEATER OF WAR  out of four stars Rating Not rated. Where Oak Street Cinema. In 2006 New Yorks Delacorte Theater staged a fantastic theatrical event Bertolt Brechts masterpiece ""Mother Courage"" starring Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline. Streep played the cunning mercenary survivialist trudging through the Thirty Years War switching alliances and carving out deals but ultimately unable to outwit inevitable fate. This behind-the-scenes account of the production preserves the actors artful intense performances and offers their insights into the social responsibility of artists in turbulent times. A strong spirit of protest against the Iraq war motivated the production. As producer Oskar Eustis observes ""Its a play that examines the question of what are the things that attract us to that which destroys us because all of us are acceding to what is being done in our name by our country."" COLIN COVERT BURMA VJ  out of four stars Rating Not rated; subtitled. Where Oak Street Cinema. Journalism might be endangered in the United States but it can get one killed in Burma where for decades the junta has cracked down violently on protesters and those who dare to cover them. This unique and startling documentary collects understandably shaky footage from the Democratic Voice of Burma whose members risked their lives to capture harrowing images of the 2007 uprising of democracy-seeking Buddhist monks and their followers in Rangoon. ""Burma VJ"" would be even more intense without its early announcement that some scenes have been restaged putting the viewer in a regrettably uncertain relationship to what follows.

ABOUT THE MOVIECloudy With a Chance of Meatballs   (out of four) Voices Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan Andy Samberg Bruce Campbell Mr. T Benjamin Bratt Lauren GrahamDirectors Phil Lord and Christopher MillerDistributor Columbia PicturesRating PG for brief mild languageRunning time 1 hour 21 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is a surprisingly savory treat though it doesnt bear much resemblance to the charming classic childrens book on which its based. While fans of the 1978 story written by Judi Barrett and illustrated by Ron Barrett may miss the distinctively inky retro-style drawings of the picture book they will not likely be disappointed by the lively and well-written animated version. The movies story expands upon the books simpler premise a wise choice given that the original story was too short and sweet for a full-length feature. Characters in the film are different as well. We meet Flint Lockwood (voiced likably by Bill Hader) as a gawky boy who idolizes scientists and inventors and dreams of making something that would help the world. But his classmates just see a nerd with such weird science projects as spray-on shoes. Only Flints mother (Lauren Graham) encourages his potential. As a young man Flint is still building contraptions -- among them a monkey-thought translator and a ""hair unbalder."" But his mom has died and his gruff father (James Caan) pressures him to join the family business. Their hometown of Swallow Falls is on an island and its livelihood is based on the export of canned sardines. Everything changes -- including the towns name--when Flint perfects a machine that transforms water into food. Instead of precipitation falling from the skies cheeseburgers pancakes doughnuts and other delicacies come crashing down delighting the denizens of the town soon renamed Chewandswallow. Suddenly everyone who had mocked Flint is regaling him as a hero. Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) a fledgling reporter at The Weather News Network is sent to report on the goings-on at Chewandswallow. She and Flint form a connection in their mutual love for science. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have written an engaging and comically absurd story with subtle messages more sophisticated than what usually is offered in animated fare. Theres a gentle anti-junk-food anti-gluttony theme as well as a clever way of resolving the strained relationship between Flint and his unexpressive dad. The enthusiastically told story lends itself well to a 3-D rendering. Tumbling food and weather phenomena made of edible material make excellent use of the medium. Supporting characters are particularly fun especially Flints monkey Steve (Neil Patrick Harris) and the witty Guatemalan doctor and pilot (Benjamin Bratt). But the movie goes overboard in its final 15 minutes. The machine goes haywire and Flint and Sam try to stop it hindered by the power-mad mayor (Bruce Campbell). The drawn-out climactic resolution is almost an assault on the senses. It induced jitters and tears among a couple of children at a screening. However the forecast for Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is appealing family fare worth relishing.

Tut tut it looks like a hit for Sony Pictures Animation. Eye-popping and mouth-watering in one ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" spins a 30-page childrens book into a 90-minute all-you-can-laugh buffet expanding the premise of a town where it rains ketchup and hot dogs to disaster-movie proportions. With drooling tongues in cheek tyro helmers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (whose only previous directing credit was cult MTV toon ""Clone High"") bring a fresh irreverent sensibility to bigscreen computer animation using 3D projection to maximize their sky-is-falling scenario. This box office and concession-stand draw should make exhibitors very happy. Considering Judi and Ron Barretts high-concept picture book offers no characters beyond its narrator Lord and Miller are to be commended for balancing their own originality with respect for the source (nearly all the books key images from a macaroni-headed bystander to the pancake-flattened school survive the leap to screen). The story opens in Swallow Falls -- ""a tiny island hidden under the A in Atlantic"" on the map -- with Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) a junior inventor whose gadgets have a way of going awry. Flint wants nothing more than to earn his fathers approval but Dad (James Caan speaking almost entirely in fishing metaphors) wishes his son would just settle for running the family bait shop. For years Swallow Falls thrived on its booming sardine industry; then the world moved on to tastier options leaving the mayor (Bruce Campbell) with no clue as to how to save the town. Fed up with fish Flint invents a device that transforms water into any kind of food and for once the gizmo actually works (sort of). Launched into the sky above Swallow Falls the machine sucks in clouds and spits out burgers bacon and eggs -- whatever he wants -- showering chow upon the town which becomes a major tourist destination overnight changing its name to Chew and Swallow. On hand to document the meteorological anomaly is wannabe weather girl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris). To deliver the initial meteorological spectacle ""Cloudy"" appropriately steals Spielbergs signature eyes-wide mouth-ajar reaction shot to build anticipation for a big reveal and repeats it for every major character on the island before finally showing the truly stunning burger-shaped cloud formation. Lord and Miller are savvy pop-culture sponges synthesizing decades of film and TV viewing into a sensibility thirtysomething parents and their kids will embrace immediately (the casting of Mr. T as the town cop is particularly inspired as is Mark Mothersbaughs geek-chic score positioned at the intersection of Bruckheimer fare and science fair). Aesthetically the plain character designs may not seem much to look at but their elastic faces move like Muppets while their Gumby-like bodies support a wide range of hilarious poses. Initially drab and gray the environment erupts with color as soon as the weather turns tasty featuring a palette that pops even more than ""Ups"" South American balloon ride (the photoreal food meanwhile dramatically expands on ""Ratatouilles"" menu). The takeaway here is that its OK to be a nerd which applies not only to the young lovebirds (Sam is constantly apologizing for her brainy outbursts) but also the directors themselves who tackle ""Cloudy"" like a thought experiment taking a crazy idea and seeing it through to its philosophical conclusion. In this case that means staging a giant aerial battle against the army of mutant food that has risen up to defend Flints device -- a finale that evokes such sci-fi staples as ""Independence Day"" and ""Star Wars"" if the Death Star were a giant meatball. Teetering just this side of haywire the climax works (in 3D at least) perhaps only by virtue of its visceral roller-coaster appeal. Both the father-son relationship and romantic subplot satisfy but Lord and Miller are remiss to ignore a proper villain. (Flints insubordinate invention echoes a red-eyed HAL though the power-hungry mayor seems equally responsible for letting things get out of control.) The directors clearly privilege comedy over drama and as the epic food fight winds down they cleverly use various recurring gags to deliver a final emotional payoff. Pics visual design is staggering featuring crowd sequences and a giant ""foodalanche"" that would have crashed the servers a few years back. The stereoscopic design is easy on the eyes yet playful with its use of space yielding some of the most satisfying 3D viewing to date.

Alas Mitchell had his finances bled dry by higher-than-indicated payments and lost his modest home -- including the garden out back which fed his kids -- while Paulson walked away with a tax-free 600 million nest egg. If ever an occasion called for guttersnipe fury its the subprime lending crisis and its subsequent 8 trillion bailout but this authoritative far-reaching documentary by veteran investigative journalists Leslie and Andrew Cockburn comes off as curiously bloodless. They lead with the sense-numbing contours of the crisis -- the ""house of cards"" described in an internal Standard amp; Poors memo as early as 2006 propped up on credit derivatives CDOs and deceitful loans targeting minorities and the working poor -- before showing the devastating effect of this chicanery on a Baltimore neighborhood wracked by more than 700 foreclosures. (This should have been the sixth season of The Wire.) The serious-TV blandness of the filmmaking mutes the outrage its subjects provoke and the ""casino"" metaphor does little to bolster their arguments visually or thematically. Indeed a better metaphor might have been cancer The Cockburns most inventive stroke is to show the crisis effects manifesting as a kind of heartland metastasis -- unkempt lawns heralding a plummet in property values abandoned swimming pools turning into breeding grounds for virus-spreading mosquitoes. Grim as that is the filmmakers prove beyond doubt that America has far bigger bloodsuckers to worry about. (Music Hall) (Jim Ridley)THE BURNING PLAIN Oregon restaurant manager Charlize Theron prone to submissive promiscuity and self-inflicted violence sits naked in bed next to her lover. A decade or so earlier an abandoned trailer in the middle of the New Mexico desert blazes the title into being. In the fractured self-impressed screenplays of Guillermo Arriaga (Babel 21 Grams) events unfold out of time and space effects before causes. Arriaga engages us not by playing out human complexities but by using rim shots that reveal how each jigsaw piece fits into his puzzle. (Gee will that little blond girl in the desert grow up to be Charlize? Does she cut her thighs to punish herself for something discovered in the final act? Better keep watching.) The writers most successful works -- The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada and Amores Perros -- were bolstered by directors who brought genuine emotion to the screen but The Burning Plain marks Arriagas behind-the-camera debut and his obviousness is staggering. The present tense rains down in gray-blue melancholy while the past comes sun-kissed in orange and the sensational pop-psychological damage wrought by two generations onto a third carries all the dramatic heft of a telenovela albeit one with award-bait cinematography. (The Landmark; Sunset 5; Town Center 5; Playhouse 7) (Aaron Hillis)GO  CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS By the time the brilliant fuckup of a hero said to the heroine ""Why do you do that -- say something supersmart and then bail from it?"" Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs had won me over. The line is followed by a makeover of said heroine which is less about remaking her than freeing her; it rings more true than a slew of Jennifer Aniston and Sandra Bullock movies combined. Written and directed by Christopher Miller and Phil Lord who adapted the script from the popular childrens book Cloudy is smart insightful on a host of relationship dynamics and filled with fast-paced action. When failed inventor Flint (fantastically voiced by Bill Hader) accidentally creates a machine that makes food fall from the sky he revamps his rep as the town laughingstock and catches the eye of fledgling reporter Sam Sparks (voiced by Anna Faris) who masks her intelligence beneath a veneer of ditziness. The duo is tested of course when things go horribly awry and lessons about self-confidence -- and the distinction between confidence and assholery -- is driven home. The 3-D effects are wonderful full of witty sight gags that play out both center-screen and on the periphery while immensely appealing secondary characters (a policeman voiced by Mr. T; a loving but tongue-tied dad voiced by James Caan; and a scene-stealing monkey voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) round off a film that plays as well for adults as kids. (Citywide) (Ernest Hardy)GO  CRUDE Water water everywhere but not a drop to drink. Why? Because its thick with sludge. Moving briskly through a stranger-than-fiction serpentine narrative that is still unfolding Joe Berlingers remarkable documentary Crude recounts an infuriating litany of South American exploitation backroom glad-handing and bureaucratic dead ends that has among other collateral damages created a Rhode Island-sized ""death zone"" of toxic pollution in the middle of the Ecuadorian Amazon. For nearly 30 years beginning in the mid-1960s the former Texaco oil company (acquired by Chevron in 2001) drilled for oil in Ecuador in and around the ancestral homeland of the indigenous Cofan Indian community. In 1992 Texaco finally lost its government-granted concession and was forced to cede control of its drilling sites to state-owned Petroecuador. Three years later Texaco conducted a purported ""environmental remediation"" as part of a 40 million settlement with the Ecuadorian government that in turn indemnified the company against any further government claims. And yet today the soil and waters of the area still run black with oil the Cofan are dying of cancer at an alarming rate and the buck for this enviro-disaster is being passed between Chevron and Petroecuador faster than a Bobby Hull slap shot. A master of true-crime verite Berlinger (Brothers Keeper Paradise Lost) does a superb job of taking us through the twists and turns of the decade-and-a-half multibillion-dollar class-action lawsuit filed by the Cofan against Chevron -- a legal battle nearly as long as the Amazon itself and with no discernible end in sight.

Sep. 13 600pm JENNIFERS BODY A premeditated cult classic -- theyre kind of like ""preworn"" designer jeans -- Jennifers Body seems designed to be quoted more than watched. This is the sophomore production from Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody similarly told through ultra-stylized slangy teen dialogue which is cool in theory in the way it respects the verbal resourcefulness of idle kids but is excruciating to listen to in actual fact. Megan Foxs lithe Jennifer is BFF to goldfish-faced bespectacled Amanda Seyfrieds ""Needy"" -- the nickname underlines the essentially condescending dynamic in their high school relationship which also digresses into the best close-up girl-girl liplock since Cruel Intentions. Jenny is transformed from a flaunting tease into a literal man-eater a boy-gobbling succubus after going off one night in some out-of-town rockers van (the movie can read as a cautionary tale on the dangers of trolling for hot band dudes instead of sticking with your schlubby boyfriend) setting up a Good Girl vs. Bad Girl knockdown-drag-out. The suburban interior decor is about a generation off but the satire is roughly contemporary with routine ""risky"" digs at 9/11 kitsch (and generally the American ""Tragedy boner"") and a re-enactment of the Great White club fire. Lines like ""Sandbox love never dies"" could be lyrics to the Warped Tour riffs to which Fox slo-mo sashays at the camera. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton)JORDON SAFFRON TASTE THIS Give Sergio Myers some credit -- the man knows his reality TV. The creator of MTVs proto-Laguna Beach show Sorority Life successfully transplants the look and style of the schlocky TV genre for his film Jordon Saffron -- Taste This a limp satire of egomaniacal celebrity chefs. Casting himself as the titular restaurateur Myers eschews a script in favor of improv which results in scenes that run far past their natural comedic threshold. Someone should have reminded him and his not-quite-ready-for-prime-time cast that they were making a comedy not a documentary. The best thing about Jordon Saffron is Myers as Saffron a prat whose expletive-laden rants and complete lack of self-awareness seem as close to Danny McBride in Eastbound amp; Down as to Gordon Ramsay. The film is raucously funny during Saffrons professional and personal meltdowns but the long scenes of repetitive jokes the dreary reality-TV style and some very strange accents bring down the whole affair. The story of Saffrons fall and rise as a chic cuisinier riffs lamely on Rocky -- even the theme is a heist of ""Eye of the Tiger"" -- but Myers is intelligent enough to know that if his protagonist actually learns anything by the end of this comeback story then the satire becomes meaningless. Hopefully the clearly talented Myers will try a different recipe for his next concoction. (Sunset 5) (John Wheeler)GO  LAILAS BIRTHDAY Toward the end of Palestinian filmmaker Rashid Masharawis tragicomedy about daily life in his West Bank hometown the frustrated protagonist shakes his fists at the heavens and blames the 60-year Israeli occupation for his woes. Thats the only direct polemic in Lailas Birthday and this beguiling second feature after the respectfully received Ticket to Jerusalem is all the better for keeping its head close to the ground of the surreal business of getting through the day in Ramallah. Veteran Israeli-Arab actor Mohammed Bakri (whose son Saleh played the hunky young Chet Baker fan in The Bands Visit and has a small but significant role here) plays Abu Laila an unemployed judge eking out a living as a taxi driver who heads out to work at the beginning of the film charged with bringing home a gift and a cake for his little girls birthday. Prickly unbending and a rigid follower of rules Abu Laila is hopelessly ill-equipped for the bedlam of a city plagued by corruption inefficiency and the occasional missile from across the border. Part Tati part Chaplin part absurdist satire in the manner of Palestinian director Elia Suleiman (Chronicle of a Disappearance) Lailas Birthday is beautifully shot and overlaid with a spare lyrical score that lends rueful emphasis to Masharawis exasperated fidelity to a chronically malfunctioning city. (Music Hall)--  (Ella Taylor) LOVE HAPPENS ""The sap pollutes the water and then they die"" florist Eloise (Jennifer Aniston) upbraids her employee on the importance of cauterizing stems. A similar befouling occurs in the directorial debut of Brandon Camp who with Mike Thompson co-wrote Love Happens -- which is not so much a romance as it is a male weepie. Aaron Eckhart plays Burke a widowed self-help author leading a seminar in Seattle for those mourning the loss of loved ones. The healer isnt fully healed himself of course necessitating emotional helpmeet Eloise who takes Burke to a poetry slam (only the presence of PDAs reminded me that the film was not set in 1992) the graves of Bruce and Brandon Lee and the woods of Washington to set a parrot free. Burkes hollow pop-psychspeak lightly ridiculed at first is wholly embraced by the films end if not as adamantly as the outrageous product placements for Qwest and Home Depot the latter crucial to a seminar attendees recovery. Eckhart has even less chemistry with Aniston than he did with fellow narcissist Catherine Zeta-Jones in 2007s No Reservations going soft and gooey only when he and Martin Sheen as Burkes father-in-law share a big cry. (Citywide) (Melissa Anderson)PARIS Paris as overdocumented as any great city still has new facets to reflect. For proof see Claire Denis idiosyncratically observed 35 Shots of Rum -- a contrast to Cedric Klapischs Paris panorama an encyclopedia of ""types"" and banal cest la vie lessons. When an ensemble film works you welcome the shifts between characters intrigued to catch up with each in turn. Paris rounds feel like obligatory visits. Romain Duris an actor whose overuse is symptomatic of Frances shallow talent pool does his preset clenched forehead as a dancer facing possibly fatal illness. Fabrice Luchinis professor of Parisian history gets the lone funny business sending dirty text messages to a student (Inglourious Basterds Melanie Laurent -- more spellbinding than Paris co-star Juliette Binoche ever was). The white working class and African immigrants get obliging nods and theres Francois Cluzets architect here mostly for a nightmare scene expressing commonplaces about urban planning. There are some good unusual stop-offs (Rungis the massive wholesale market; Baudelaires gilded suite on the Ile Saint-Louis) as well as location resourcefulness (Klapisch coordinates a string of scenes along the citys highest monuments). At 124 minutes though the writer-director has stretched a wide canvas and only sporadically found anything worth filling it. (The Landmark; Town Center 5; Playhouse 7) (Nick Pinkerton)PRETTY UGLY PEOPLE Pretty Lousy Movie. Former fatty Lucy (Missi Pyle) tells her old posse of college friends that shes dying and summons them to Montana where it turns out that the death in question is merely the metaphorical passing on of her old overweight self. Now a total babe she wants everyone to celebrate the loss of her final four pounds over the course of a three-day wilderness hike that nobody actually wants to do. At first Lucy seems so manic and crazed that the viewer might suspect this will turn into a slasher movie. Later when it becomes clear just how annoying and unlikable each character is youll pray that it turns into a slasher movie. Alas writer-director Tate Taylor instead seems to be reaching for a Gen-X take on The Big Chill sans high-powered soundtrack insightful script or skilled actors. So yes we get the obligatory boring married couple having second thoughts (Melissa McCarthy and Philip Littell); the former radical who now seems like a sell-out (Phill Lewis); the guy (Larry Sullivan) still nursing a schoolboy crush etc. What we dont get is a reason to care. It takes an immensely contrived third-act crisis to create even the vaguest sympathy for this group; and yes as the title suggests most of them are supposed to be jerks. But Lucy is no better interrupting their lives on a whim with a gigantic lie for the benefit of her own ego. At least Pyle got something out of this -- she met her husband a bear trainer on set. (Sunset 5) (Luke Y. Thompson)SORORITY ROW The first credit to roll for Sorority Row director Stewart Hendlers highly unnecessary remake of a 1983 slasher is for a character identified as the ""Bra-clad sister."" A few entries down are ""Slutty sister"" ""Ditzy sister"" and ""Sarcastic sister."" Im not sure you need to know much more than that but here goes anyway Among these luminaries is a group of sorority seniors whose idea of a revenge prank is convincing a young man that he has killed his girlfriend with an ill-timed roofie. The vaguely sensible one among them (played by Briana Evigan whose resemblance to Demi Moore puts her co-star -- and Moores actual offspring -- Rumer Willis to a strange sort of shame) protests the groups plan to cover up the death of their fellow sister when the prank tanks and takes the lead when a graduation gown-wearing maniac begins killing off everyone associated with the death. A very thin feminist subtext about the meaning of sisterhood only highlights how badly this film botches its attempt to have it both ways naked bleeding cuties combined with ""final girl""-ish butt-whipping empowerment. Call me the sarcastic sister but the only things screaming in any convincing way here are the cheap look epileptic direction and off-key ""edgy"" humor. Its all so 80s I could die. (Citywide) (Michelle Orange) GO  STINGRAY SAM Eight years after his underseen debut feature The American Astronaut writer-director-singer-songwriter Cory McAbee returns with another sui generis sci-fi/western/musical set in a parallel universe where Mars is a bottomed-out casino town and the rest of the galaxy has been stratified by an interstellar class war. McAbee a cross between Buck Rogers and Gene Autry stars as the titular gunslinger-turned-lounge singer enlisted by his old sidekick the Quasar Kid (Crugie) to rescue the kidnapped daughter of a celebrity carpenter from the clutches of a genetically engineered man-child despot called Fredward (Justin Taylor). And thats just the first of Stingray Sams six serialized 10-minute episodes which premiered as a gallery installation at this years Sundance Film Festival and will be available for Web downloading in concert with their theatrical release. Shot like Astronaut in crisp black-and-white with ingenious shoestring production values (including reams of backstory conveyed through tinted animated collages) each installment features at least one of McAbees genre-bending lounge-rock musical numbers. In an American indie-film landscape where a 500 Days of Summer is lauded for its ""originality"" McAbee should be a candidate for canonization. Somebody get this man an order for a second season. (Downtown Independent) (Scott Foundas)TYLER PERRYS I CAN DO BAD ALL BY MYSELF If you are the director producer writer (adapting your own stage play) and co-star of a film you really show how bad you can do all by yourself. Usually thrilling in their lunacy most Tyler Perry movies can at least keep up their momentum through the combination of an overstuffed plot and the presence of Madea the big-boned granny who will rip out your urethra tube if you sass her. Perrys latest -- about a boozy nightclub singer April (Taraji P. Henson) begrudgingly sheltering her niece and nephews -- has so many dead moments that singing spots by Gladys Knight Pastor Marvin Winans and Mary J. Blige simply highlight rather than alleviate the inertia. Madea tonic in Februarys Madea Goes to Jail appears onscreen for only about 15 minutes at least sharing an inspired bit about Siegfried and Roy on Noahs ""arch."" If the Atlanta impresario is just bored with cranking out two adaptations of his earlier stage work annually the audience is getting restless too I counted at least three walkouts at the 11 a.m. show I attended. Though Perry may have stuck with his chitlin-circuit material for too long I still cant wait to see what he does with the choreopoem in an upcoming project -- directing Ntozake Shanges For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf. (Citywide) (Melissa Anderson)WHITEOUT In this earnest but muddled Antarctic thriller a masked man kills research scientists who may have stumbled upon a valuable object hidden beneath the ice. Figuring out the murderers identity falls to U.S. Marshal Carrie Stetko (Kate Beckinsale) with help from the research stations doctor (Tom Skerritt) and a shady U.N. investigator (Gabriel Macht). Carrie is a good detective tortured by memories of a Miami drug bust gone bad and in a regrettable blunder director Dominic Sena (Kalifornia Gone in 60 Seconds) and his four credited screenwriters have chosen to stage that failed arrest in a series of hokey flashbacks that always end with Sena cutting back to a zoned-out Carrie who literally shakes her head to clear the bad vibes. One feels for Beckinsale a B-movie action queen badly in need of a comedy and a script that doesnt require as this one does her stripping down to her skivvies in the opening scene. It could be said that Whiteout is an honest attempt to set an old-fashioned whodunit in an exotic locale but the mystery at the films core is so hopelessly dull that one begins to long for a third-act cameo by the Abominable Snowman. (Citywide) (Chuck Wilson) GO  YOU THE LIVING You the Living flips through 50-some single-panel vignettes many very funny arranged by Roy Andersson a Swedish director best known for his commercials and 2000s Songs From the Second Floor. An (almost always) stationary camera captures a procession of lugubrious Stockholmians; the caption to most of the stills could be ""I cant go on."" Connections between scenes are loose if any. A heaplike 50-ish biker gal replays teen-angst classics (""Nobody understands me"") for her boyfriend in a public park. A man hunched over a walker obliviously drags his pet terrier behind him tangled in its leash. A prematurely embalmed-looking fellow complains about his pension plans while his stout Brunhilde of a wife mounts him. Andersson particularly delights in left-outs the guy who cant squeeze into the bus stop during a downpour; the natty little suitor getting his bouquet smashed in a slamming door. The sum total is the reflection of a worldview -- sad sack bordering on ""Everybody Hurts"" black-velvet sad-clown bathos -- rather than any narrative. The title comes from Goethes ""Roman Elegies"" an admonition to appreciate ones measure of life ""before Lethes ice-cold wave will lick your escaping foot."" This I take to be one of Anderssons dry jokes as his anhedonic characters already seem settled in Hades -- a streetcar even lists Lethe as its destination.

BOTTOM LINE Clever and zippy with some nutritional value hidden in the fun. CAST Bill Hader Anna Faris James Caan Bruce Campbell LENGTH 121 Meals fell from the sky in the 1978 childrens book ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" a whimsical fantasy that doubled as a cautionary tale about portion control. It didnt stop Americas obesity epidemic but theres hope Not long after Pixars ""WALL-E"" envisioned a future of globular humans raised on fast food and high-fructose soda Sonys computer-animated version of ""Meatballs"" draws another satiric picture of gluttony. In Swallow Falls whose sardine-based economy has hit a recession teenage science geek Flint Lockwood (amiably voiced by Bill Hader) devises a bailout plan a rocket-boosted pod that turns cloud-moisture into any type of food you like. For once his crazy invention works creating cheeseburger rain ice-cream flurries and steak showers all of which make this films 3-D and Imax versions worth finding. Flints conservative father (a lovably gruff James Caan) predicts disaster but the towns ambitious mayor (Bruce Campbell) sees gastro-tourism potential. Even as the machine goes into overdrive producing meteoric meatballs and frighteningly long hot dogs the mayor pushes for more. advertisement | advertise on newsday Writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller whose television credits include CBS ""How I Met Your Mother"" pack each scene with jokes big and small and the voice cast shines Mr. T stars as an overzealous cop (complete with blue short shorts) Neil Patrick Harris gives voice to a frenetic monkey and Andy Samberg plays a former sardine poster boy who has become an overgrown Gerber baby. The smartest addition to the book though is weathergirl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris) a perky blonde who plays dumb. Thanks to Flint she discovers that intelligence can be attractive. That makes two valuable lessons more than the USRDA in most kids films.

Judi and Ron Barretts childrens book has been tantalizing kids taste buds for ?30 years. So adapting the beloved ?story into a 3-D flick was a risky move.

Saturday Night Lives Bill Hader is restrained as Flint a nerdy inventor who transforms the sleepy town of Swallow Falls into a meteorological marvel where the skies pour pizza burgers and Gummi Bears.

Sony Picturess Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs may not scale the artistic heights of a Finding Nemo or Wall-E but its the most satisfying and original non-Pixar CG animated movie to hit screens in a while.On a remote island principality in the mid-Atlantic the populace have been living on sardines since the canned-fish market dried up. So plucky young scientist Flint Lockwood inventor of overactive hair-unbalder and spray-on shoes (which you can never remove) commits himself to solving the problem. His answer is a machine which turns water into food creating anything from sliced pizza to ice cream with toppings. Its a success - until a freak accident happens the machine goes berserk and it starts to rain cheeseburgers.The makers of the film are not remotely interested in pop-culture references or celebrity cameos the voice cast favours stalwarts like Anna Faris and James Caan over inappropriate A-listers. Banishing such petty distractions frees director Phil Lord to focus on more important issues like story and character the plot is wonderfully twisty building to an eyeball-frazzling culinary climax of truly epic proportions. The characters are equally well drawn from self-absorbed overambitious doofus Flint to his expressionless but somehow heartbreaking sad-sack dad Tim. But the films greatest pleasure - and the element that sets it apart from its smarmy in-jokey predecessors - is its bizarre sense of humour. Fusing snappy one-liners with a kid-friendly seam of slapstick incorporating everything from talking monkeys to homicidal Gummi Bears the script provokes comparison with comedy from The Marx Brothers to The Mighty Boosh. This sense of unpredictability coupled with some breathlessly paced and visually stunning action scenes makes this the animated success of 2009... at least until Up opens next month.
