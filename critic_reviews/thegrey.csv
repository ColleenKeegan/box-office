Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.In ""The Grey"" Liam Neeson quickly emerges as the leader of the men.Story highlights""The Grey"" is impressively shot in northern British ColumbiaLiam Neesons in his element as the raw alpha male who takes the others in handThe films single best sequence comes early on -- the plane crashWriter-director Joe Carnahan wisely gets back to basics in ""The Grey"" after the over the top CGI heroics of ""The A-Team.""In their last collaboration Liam Neeson fell out of the clouds in a tank and lived to tell the tale. This time hes stranded in the arctic wastes of Alaska when the plane transporting a crew of rugged oil drillers crashes in the back of beyond. The half dozen survivors are in bad shape with few supplies no chance of contacting the outside world and little hope of rescue. They have sub-zero temperatures to contend with howling winds and snow and the only source of meat on the horizon -- a pack of timber wolves -- has its own ideas about the pecking order on the food chain.Neeson quickly emerges as the leader of the men. Hes a head taller than anybody else and maybe a head smarter too. He also knows wolves so he says -- though its hard to believe anyone on this movie could claim as much. Any animal expert could tell you that timber wolves are more likely to run in the opposite direction than give chase to humans. Compared to a grizzly bear your typical North American grey is a pussycat. Thats not the kind of animal Neeson and company bump into. These puppies are of the big bad variety vicious lethal and relentless.Neeson -- perhaps rashly -- decides to abandon the wrecked plane and strike out south into the woods. Hes followed by a rapidly depleting line of the walking wounded and a posse of salivating lupus. This is bare bones storytelling in more ways than one though Carnahan cant resist injecting stray purple pronouncements of existential angst (I kept hoping that one of the guys would get hold of the letter Neeson has stashed in his pocket the one where he tells the girl who got away hes exiled himself to live with the dregs of humanity ""Ex cons misfits a... men unfit for mankind"").Fortunately hes a better filmmaker than he is a screenwriter. Impressively shot in northern British Columbia by the talented Masanobu Takayanagi the movie feels grounded and real even when the dialogue (and the angry wolf pack) rings false. Interspersing exciting action sequences with tense slogs through hostile terrain the movie has the structure of a classic western with wolves standing in for outlaws or Indians. Its old hat but it still plays.Neesons in his element as the raw alpha male who reluctantly takes the others in hand. They include an angry macho Latino (Frank Grillo) a boring nice guy (Dermot Mulroney) and an ailing black guy (Nonso Anozie) who might as well have ""Kibble"" tattooed to his forehead. Even though Carnahan never digs up anything very surprising about these stock characters the terse shape-shifting group dynamics are enough to keep us watching. The films single best sequence comes early on. The plane crash -- and the nicely pitched run-up to it as the passengers (all men) stow their bravado and start to grapple with what they might be facing -- is a knockout. Five minutes of pure white-knuckle drama. Even though nothing later comes close to it for enterprise or excitement ""The Grey"" remains a genuinely gripping survival story and a refreshing change from stale urban action flicks ""Jaws"" on paws.

"Grey The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; grey-the ) Grey The (United States 2012) January 30 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Some would argue that the best way to see Alaska is through the images captured by an expert photographer. As breathtaking as the views may be the climate can be unforgiving with weather terrain and fauna that might give even notable survival expert Bear Gryllis pause. In The Grey director Joe Carnahans man vs. nature epic the filmmaker strands seven characters in the midst of some of the most inhospitable territory on earth and shows that when faced with seemingly insurmountable obstacles to survival human beings have a tendency to look inward. The Grey is about raging against the dying of the light but also about accepting it with peace once the fight has been lost. January and February while not considered a prime market for motion pictures have been good to Liam Neeson. Clad in the mantle of The Everyday Action Hero Neeson has capitalized on his stolid reputation and a weak release schedule to burn up the box office with Taken (in January 2008) and Unknown (in February 2011). That is likely the reason Open Road Films elected to distribute The Grey to theaters in the dead of winter and to open it in multiplexes when one could easily argue it is art house fare. The Grey is technically an adventure film. Its about a bunch of guys struggling against snowstorms cold starvation hostile terrain and wolves to find their way back to civilization. Yet it does not play out the way most movies of this sort do. Theres an almost poetic quality to the way things develop with characters becoming increasingly introspective. The Grey descends into the existential with discussions about God and faith and deals with how a person confronts the inevitable when he is face-to-face with it. Action lovers may be sorely disappointed. The film does not offer 90 minutes of man-on-wolf action. In fact physical encounters are in short supply. The Grey is more concerned with how the men cope with the danger of the wolves presence than what happens when a clash occurs. The movie opens with a short prologue that gathers the principals together while introducing lead character Ottway (Neeson) a marksman who makes his living shooting wolves to protect workers assembling a pipeline. Despite his rugged features and taciturn disposition Ottway is a tragic man. Through fragmented flashbacks we understand that he has lost the great love of his life and he now goes about the day-to-day drudgery of living more as a distraction or an unwelcome obligation. At one point he puts the barrel of a gun to his mouth but does not pull the trigger. Instead he boards a plane with dozens of other pipeline workers. The plane crashes. He is one of handful of survivors. Ottway takes six men with him on a trek through the wilds toward the vague hope of rescue. He is convinced if they remain at the crash site the wolves will get them - a concern that is quickly validated. Yet trudging through drifts of snow in a blinding squall doesnt seem like a recipe for success. The groups already small numbers dwindle and the wolves sense an opportunity. It becomes a primal contest between the humans alpha male and the wolves alpha male. Three characters are developed enough to seem more substantive than wolf fodder. The first obviously is Ottway who is a typical Neeson creation. Ottway is steeped in irony - the man who comes within a hairs breadth of killing himself is now leading a desperate struggle for survival. For a while it looks like Diaz (Frank Grillo) is going to be a one-dimensional antagonist - the man who exists solely to provide a human villain. Fortunately Carnahan and co-writer Ian Mackenzie Jeffers have other ideas. Then theres Talget (Dermot Mulroney) a low-key individual who carries with him a tremendous weight - the wallets of all the men and women who died when the plane went down. The Greys abrupt cut-to-black at the end will undoubtedly anger some viewers but upon careful consideration its a perfect way to end the movie. In a strange way its a high point and had we stayed with events for even a few moments longer things would have ended on a less satisfying note. This is how The Grey has to end and its not as big a cliffhanger as it might initially seem. Thinking about it for even a moment allows us to recognize how things would likely play out. But not seeing them permits us the same faint measure of hope that impels the characters throughout the story. This is easily the most mature movie to date from action director Carnahan (whose most recent effort was the Neeson-led The A-Team). It has its share of clunky moments - some of the speeches are a little canned and rehearsed and theres a sense early in the film that were playing the ""guess who dies next"" game with secondary characters we know arent going to make it very far. Overall however The Grey is a welcome surprise - a suspenseful survival tale that eschews the cheesiness of The Edge in favor of something a little more thoughtful and contemplative. And unlike 127 Hours which celebrated the will to live this is about what happens when that will may not suffice.

Its really Liam Neeson vs. mans most dangerous enemy ... (drumroll please) HIMSELF. Unfortunately this is also The Greys biggest problem its overly introspective right when youre pulling for some wolf tooth on man flesh action. Also and not for nothing Liam Neesons character ""John"" isnt all that interesting - which makes the needless introspection all the more painful. Its almost as if director Joe Carnahan figured ""You know what this here action movie is gonna have some soul. Its gonna have some emotions"" only this left it feeling completely out of step with the material. Remember this opening monologue from SNL where Phil Hartman declared he was going to finally be himself only to have Steve Martin say ""I wouldnt do that if I were you Phil.""? Yeah thats The Grey trying too hard to be something it never needed to be in the first place. But back to the action. Liam ""John"" Neeson is a wolf exterminator for an oil company in The Arctic. His job is to watch the companys workers while they are out and exposed to the elements. He carries a rifle and a steady-handed aim. If you are a wolf and attempting to eat a human he will definitely ruin your whole day. This pattern follows the normal Neeson cinematic release method of winter be it ruining a kidnappers (Taken) or a fake wifes (Unknown) day. If you step to Neeson hell own you whether you be on two or four legs. He makes no distinction. His only goal is the ruin of your day. Now even that right there is enough for a legitimate story but theres more. Theres so much (100 minutes) more. The company work gang and John head out to another (even more remote) part of The Arctic (thats realistic theres a lot of snowy land up there) only to have their plane run into issues Castaway style. The fellas are then forced to fend for themselves in the cold desolate north where grey pelted and whited fanged beasts roam free unencumbered with a fear of modern man. These wolves will stop at nothing I repeat nothing if youre near their den. Hopefully youre not. John must muster the motley crew to mount either an adequate defense or escape. The priorities of the group change based on the terrain and John knows the guys are in deep trouble vs. a pack of hungry and den-defending wolves. Most of the action comes in the manner of a continual chase scene from here on out and its also a race against time due to the blistering cold. Will the gentleman escape with their lives? Can John effectively help the guys who dont know how wolves operate? All that and more are answered in The Grey three-fifths of a solid film. Still the issues mentioned in the opening paragraph loom and we owe it to ourselves to talk about them. During the nearly two-hour running time of the film John has and theres not a better way to describe it these random semi-coherent flashbacks to a past relationship. Now its not the method that spells doom as flashbacks are often used effectively to help us relate to onscreen action. No its the execution thats largely shoddy. Its all presented in blur-o-vision without much context until eventually youre left asking ""Well WHO is this person thats so important that she should take us away from imminent wolf inflicted death??"" Only they keep going back to the well on it. Add in an extremely random and poorly conceived opening scene involving John and what seems to be a case of chronic depression and youve got around 25 minutes of material that the film would have benefited from losing entirely. Its not that action films cant have feelings and the writer/director here has delivered solid entertainment in prior works such as The A-Team and Smokin Aces. It was just a strange choice to make John his own worst enemy given an enemy was right there in front of him snarling and gnashing. Cribbing the vibrant and vital wolfy energy which was right there for the taking was a definite miss but thats precisely what occurs here and it makes The Grey much less than it could have been. A shame that. Regardless and despite all my kvetching The Grey is worth a watch if only for being different. There are moments of real artistic beauty throughout and well likely not see this ""thoughtful"" style of man vs. the elements film again anytime soon. The Grey has 90 strong minutes which is more than you can say for some films (hi Iron Lady). Liam Neeson continues his run as our favorite rugged action star and the wolves acquit themselves well throughout. You could do worse and the fact that The Grey could have been better in certain parts is no reason to dismiss it entirely. Sometimes youve just got to take what January offers you with a toothy grin.

At worst everyone dies. At best everyone dies except the protagonistwhos so damaged he or she might as well be dead. Maybe the unhappiest ending of all is the non-ending as in Martha Marcy May Marlene the most irritating of many quasi horror pictures evincing a philosophical aversion to closure. Its true that most of the seminal horror films of the last half-century end badly. But not all of them Nowadays happy endings just feel wrong as if were too anxious or guilty about too many things to believe that we can overcome. See Also The Twelve Worst Ways to Be Killed by Liam Neeson Consider Ottway (Liam Neeson) the hero of the grueling survival thriller The Grey. Early on he sucks on a rifle and comes close to blowing his head off. And this is the fellow were supposed to root for to survive when his plane goes down in Alaska and the seven men who emerge from amid the mangled bodies are set upon by a pack of wolves. Ottway is grieving over a separation from his wife who appears in dreams and visions and its difficult not to have morbid thoughts of Neesons late spouse Natasha Richardson. As the dour Ottway leads the men across the snow toward a line of trees wolves pick them off one by one tearing at jugulars and viscera and disappearing into mist or darkness. The skillful cheerless director Joe Carnahan isnt a sadist but hes cruel. Theres a bravura sequence from the vantage of a man as he plunges into a canyon hitting tree branches all the way down his little daughter appearing in a vision before the wolves descend. Neesons gravity elevates the action and theres a fine prickly performance by an actor new to me Frank Grillo as the asshole of the group. (This is Fuck Citypopulation five and dwindling) But The Grey despite moments of sublimity is as predictable as a funeral. When Ottway angrily calls out to God the nonanswer is sadly redundant. Three other releases are if anything less reassuring. Ti Wests The Innkeepers is a poky but blood-freezing throwback to the gothic horror films of the seventies when ingenues moved tremulously down dark corridors without holding digital video cameras. True the heroine Claire (Sara Paxton) has a souped-up microphone that detects phantasmal cries and whispers but thats audioit seems pleasantly old-fashioned. Its the last weekend of business for the Yankee Pedlar Inn where once upon a time a bride took her life and the innkeepers hid her festering corpse in the basement. Despite the warnings of an alcoholic spiritualist (Kelly McGillis also back from the dead) Claire heads more or less straight for the scene of the desecration. Paxton de-glammed is so wonderfully gawky and funny wed follow her anywhereand do alas. Ben Wheatleys eerie and then ferocious Kill List is all hairpin turns opening like a standard B noir featuring two grumbly hit men. But the revelation that the protagonist (Neil Maskell) is a wildly unstable Iraq War vet whos used to killing without knowing why clues you into the schizoid moral universe. Kill List swerves into the most sordid vigilante territory before tumbling down a hole into the realm of Huh? Did someone put on a reel from The Wicker Man? The final twist is both baffling and repulsive but as an evocation of the triumph of evil its peerless. The weeks least downbeat film is David Mackenzies Perfect Sense a poetic plague saga in which humans senses shut down one by one a spell of despondency is followed by loss of smell ravenousness by loss of taste rage by loss of hearing etc. But calamity bonds Ewan McGregor as a caddish chef unable to love and the impossibly gorgeous Eva Green as an epidemiologist unable to find love. Instead of the pointy-headed alert to the perils of globalism and bad pork that was Contagion we get an ode to love which blooms when all elseand I mean all elsefalls away. Youve got to make room in your heart for a film in which the world ends with neither a bang nor a whimper but a cuddle. The Grey Directed By Joe Carnahan. R. The Innkeepers Directed By Ti West. R.

"Beware of predators and pretension in The Grey |       NJ.com comments Beware of predators and pretension in The Grey Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on January 27 2012 at 840 AM View/Post Comments Kimberley FrenchLiam Neeson in ""The Grey"" Its a cramped ugly bare-bones flight packed full of oil-rig workers. Then it hits a blizzard. Then it crashes in the middle of an Alaskan wasteland even Todd Palin would steer clear of. It cant get worse can it? No it cant -- until the half-dozen survivors look up and see a glittering circle of ember-red eyes as a wolf pack watches and licks its lips and slowly moves forward. This is the setup for ""The Grey"" and if thats all the movie was itd be great -- a modern Jack London story of man against nature armed only with those earliest of weapons a bright fire and a sharp stick. Unfortunately filmmaker Joe Carnahan has bigger plans. Carnahan first grabbed eyes 10 years ago with ""Narc"" an action picture whose hysteria was frequently mistaken for style. Once he had peoples eyes he doubled down with the even more extreme ""Smokin Aces"" and ""The A-Team"" abandoning any pretense to seriousness. ""The Grey"" is right from its moody title an obvious attempt to address that. But sadly it has all of the pretense and little of the seriousness. Because somewhere along the line apparently it was decided that having men fight for their lives is not enough to hang a movie on. It has to be a movie about Big Ideas. So theres a lot of angry talk on the subject of ""Why is God doing this to us?"" The fiercest invective comes from the two Catholic characters interestingly enough. At one point leader Liam Neeson even demands the Almighty come down and save him. He does not. This is seen as an important theological point although it may merely mean that the Almighty is watching a better movie. Of course there are good and passionate arguments to be had about the possibility of the divine but this is all on the level of a freshmans fiction assignment at a slightly liberal prep school -- right down to a suicide scene and a final (and predictable) ""revelation"" of why Neeson has been so darn sad the whole time. Neeson is as always a formidable presence as a man who will not be stopped from reaching that goal (or grabbing that next paycheck apparently). Frank Grillo has the flashiest part as an ex-con with ""No mas"" tattooed on his neck. The rest of the cast however is mostly wolf chow marked only by a few details -- guy with thick glasses nice guy black guy. Carnahan stages some exciting action scenes and there are a few striking images -- like the paw print of a predator slowing filling with blood from the man hes killed. But the story both begs the suspension of our disbelief (its never quite clear why they decide to leave the wreck of the plane which at least provides shelter and supplies) and presents some unbelievable ""facts"" of its own about gray wolves which are all vengeful man-eaters and about the size of Taylor Lautners buddies in ""Twilight."" I dont think the filmmakers care too much about giving the animal a bad rap though. In fact according to one report during production they deliberately had four wolves killed and carved up and used two for ""props."" They cooked and ate the other two to get into the mood. I hope they found it as hard to swallow as their movie. Ratings note The film contains strong language gory violence and alcohol abuse. (R) The Grey (117 min.) Directed by Joe Carnahan.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Director Joe Carnahan who co-wrote the script with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (based on the Jeffers story ""Ghost Walker"") pushes the limits of dramatic tension in the style of his reputation-making 2002 film Narc. Gone is the slick escapist bounce of Carnahans A-Team. The Grey holds you in its grip by staying close to the heart of darkness inside each of its characters. Neeson is just tremendous finding the fragility underlining Ottways bravado. Thoughts of suicide haunt Ottway since his split from his wife (Anne Openshaw seen in flashbacks). But Ottways sense of command bonds the group despite protest from ex-con Diaz (Frank Grillo). The men including Dermot Mulroney James Badge Dale Dallas Roberts Nonso Anozie and Joe Anderson snipe at one another as the elements drain their humanity. Each actor creates a full portrait even when the script does not. What ultimately unites them is their fear of the marauding wolves. Carnahan uses puppets men in wolf suits even trained animals to take these creatures out of digital fantasy and into a stark reality that will haunt your nightmares. Shot by the gifted cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi on location in British Columbia the movie chills you to the bone. Carnahan goes a step further by adding the shiver that comes from plumbing the violence of the mind. The Grey full of beauty and terror and a healing sense of grace brings us face to face with our own worst fears. Hold on tight. Its a true call of the wild.

Tears dont usually come easily to men in survival movies especially before theyve shared the bonding experience of devolving into murderous animals. ""The Grey"" however is a different beast. Its a puzzling mix of brutal violence and softhearted sentiment both embodied at once in Liam Neeson as a poetry-quoting alpha male named Ottaway. The films conflicting tones never quite mesh but some fine acting and powerful moments make ""The Grey"" watchable if not entirely compelling. The title refers to a large wolf whose pack is hunting the human survivors though it also applies to Ottaway. Hes a sorrowful loner -- a type Neeson plays well -- leading a pack of misfits that includes the nihilistic Diaz (Frank Grillo) the God-fearing Talget (Dermot Mulroney) and others who are less definable (i.e. more disposable). Between facing down animals and each other theyll relate personal stories form friendships and -- again unexpectedly -- apologize when they get too aggressive. MoviesTop 100 biggest movies of all time Director Joe Carnahan (""Smokin Aces"") literally goes for the jugular -- the scenes of men being eaten like fresh gazelles are harrowing -- but he also shows real sensitivity lingering on faces as awful decisions are made. Based on a short story by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers who wrote the script with Carnahan ""The Grey"" touches on heavy themes of God and nature but doesnt know quite what its saying. Its ending amounts to a shrug as if the film is hoping youll be the one to make sense of it all. advertisement | advertise on newsday Plot.

Photo A group of plane-crash survivors (led by Liam Neeson center) battles the Alaskan cold and killer wolves in this tense testosterone-filled thriller. Forsaken in a cruel wilderness a man looks to God and pleads for help. Receiving no answer he says ""F- -k Ill do it myself."" There isnt quite enough of that kind of flinty dialogue in the survival thriller ""The Grey"" but the level of manly bravado is more than sufficient. Director Joe Carnahan the hyperactive force behind ""Smokin Aces"" this time slows things down to highly pleasing effect. As Liam Neesons loner and a group of fellow survivors of a plane crash try to outwit the wolves stalking them there are moments of stern beauty and quiet devastation. Neeson begins the movie narrating a compelling prologue that turns out to be a letter to the woman who left him. For some reason hes stuck working for an oil company in Alaska together with ""ex-cons fugitives drifters. Men unfit for mankind."" Spoken like a man whos taken a walk through the newsroom of any tabloid. He takes his rifle out to shoot wolves and for a moment puts the business end in his mouth. After an airborne misadventure with some fellow roughnecks he tells the others what he knows about wolves in the midst a lot. It turns out his job with the oil company is to put bullets in canis lupus wherever he lurks. The middle of the movie sags when the story turns into a routine but serviceable variation on ""Ten Little Indians"" or ""The Poseidon Adventure."" Insufficiently developed characters get bloodily removed from the action one by one. In between encounters with wolves too much screen time is wasted on dull quarrels and routine chatter about whether there is an afterlife. Still there is some sparkle to the writing. When the men feast on roasted wolf one of them says ""Im more of a cat person."" And Carnahan keeps delivering beautifully crafted scenes. The initial meeting with the toothy predators works superbly as the director gradually reveals seven sets of gleaming eyes raking the darkness like tiny headlights. There is an exquisite tenderness to a couple of death scenes too thanks to a sense that life truly matters that is utterly absent from most adventure films. ""Who do you love?"" Neesons character asks a man who is breathing his last. Neeson -- this linebacker priest -- is the perfect choice to play such a soulful rifleman and the way images from the mens dreams interplay with the grim reality closing in on them is affecting. ""The Grey"" arm wrestles rather than tackles the harsh riddles of manly existence that were so memorably anatomized in its fellow subzero odysseys ""The Edge"" and ""Runaway Train"" and like those films it may be too conventional for the art-house crowd yet too arty for the megaplex. I prefer to call it an unusually reflective blood-and-guts saga.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 27 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English There are a few middling thrills and mortal musings in The Grey a survival yarn in which a group of plane-crash victims must contend with a relentless wolf pack. Thanks to Liam Neesons intelligent gravitas and a snowy Smithers B.C. location (substituting for Alaska) the film sustains some suspense and brooding atmosphere for its first half but eventually the cliches of character and dialogue drag it struggling to ground. In this film image released by Open Road Films from left Liam Neeson is shown in a scene from ""The Grey."" Open Road Films/Kimberley French/AP video Video Neesons The Grey tops box office Movies The Grey The official trailer Director-writer Joe Carnahan ( Narc Smokin Aces The A-Team) and co-screenwriter Ian Mackenzie Jeffries (working from his own short story) kick things off with a noirish existential voiceover. Neeson is the grimly miserable John Ottway a sharpshooter hired to keep wild animals away from oil pipeline workers. As he tells us these are ""men not fit to live among men"" living at the end of the world. Heading outside the bar he sticks a rifle in his mouth but is stopped when hes distracted by the howl of a wolf. Soon he has another opportunity to contemplate the thin line between life and death after he boards a plane with some of the other workers to head back home. As he drifts off into a dream about the beautiful woman who apparently left him (Anne Openshaw) hes suddenly jolted awake as the plane loses control and crashes. Only seven of the passengers survive after Ottway talks a dying man through his last breaths. There is a little food some mini-bottles of whisky and lighters for fire. They may be able to hold on. Then the wolves make their presences felt with a mass chorus of howls and sudden constellations of glowing eyeballs in the night. After a brief challenge from ex-con Diaz (Frank Grillo) Ottway establishes himself as the human alpha male They have to get moving he insists. Also hidden underneath the parkas and beards are Dermot Mulroney as a pining dad and Dallas Roberts as a reflective type. At its most ambitious The Grey aspires to mimic a Jack London or Ernest Hemingway tale of men in extreme conditions fighting their inner and outer demons. Despite the splendid scenery and the mens proximity to giant fangs too often The Grey feels oddly stagey when the men settle down into long stretches of dialogue. A pattern is soon established The men argue and talk about their various peculiar family arrangements. Then they move on. Then the wolves attack and reduce their numbers once more. The remaining men move on again. The wolves in contrast are more of a letdown the closer they get. The real trained animals we see in the distance are fascinating. The CGI and animatronic creatures used in closeups look as though they were part of Jacobs extended family in the Twilight movies. Particularly underwhelming are the attack scenes which employ the usual flurried Mixmaster editing of slasher films. On the more admirable side The Grey implies intriguing connections between the wolf leader and Ottway as a grizzled lone wolf making his last stand. As the men keep getting picked off the narrative slides toward a refreshingly grim and ambiguous ending. There are in fact two endings to the movie One is for the quitters who disappear as the final credits roll. Another is for those who like Neesons character show the fortitude to hang on to the bitter end.

The Grey (  stars out of four R opens Friday) takes the notion of their vicious natures to new extremes as dozens of hulking bright-eyed beasts attack a ragtag assortment of plane-crash survivors with startling ferocity. When theyre not ripping people to shreds -- as seen up close and personal through an annoyingly shaky camera -- theyre lurking ominously nearby howling and growling.Liam Neeson stars as Ottway a melancholy loner working among oil-rig roughnecks. Apparently its his job to keep the work site safe from animal attacks. When hes not shooting the furry denizens hes obsessing over a letter he wrote to a woman he loved and lost. He spends a good portion of the movie rereading that letter. He has recurring dreams about his beloved lying in gauzy sheets and he often recites the lines of a trite poem and consistently reaffirms his lack of religious faith.Fresh moves are clearly not this guys thing.Subtlety is not a trait preferred by writer-director Joe Carnahan (The A Team) either. Early on Neesons Ottway sticks a shotgun in his mouth. Why he doesnt pull the trigger is left unexplained.Next he boards a small plane bound for Anchorage. Shortly after takeoff turbulence rocks the plane and it crashes spectacularly in what looks like Arctic tundra. Bodies and plane parts are mangled and scattered across the icy landscape. Ottway takes charge rounding up the half-dozen survivors and calming a dying man.This all seems out of character for a guy who a few scenes earlier had seemingly lost the will to live. But hes still no match for the menacing wolves. Suspense devolves into a rote tale of man vs. beast. The survivors dont fully capture our sympathies because no one is given much dimension. Verbal nastiness erupts occasionally between the humans but most of their time is spent trudging through snowdrifts and getting into bloody tussles with wolves.In a climactic scene the wolf pack inexplicably stands patiently waiting for Ottway to get ready arm himself and take a few moments to recite a snippet of a hackneyed poem before they attack. Its as if they were instructed on the gentlemanly art of battle.In every other scene the wolves come off as more brutal than bears sharks and anacondas combined. With its reliance on jolts sudden movements and thunderous sounds The Grey is more startling than frightening. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Joy Tipping Follow JoyTipping Joys Jaunts Published 26 January 2012 0300 PM Updated 26 January 2012 0512 PM Related Opening this week Watch trailers for Albert Nobbs The Grey Man on a Ledge and more Showtimes for The Grey Youll want to have a hot steamy bath lined up immediately after seeing The Grey. Youll feel frozen to the bone -- this gritty relentlessly intense survival tale easily gets dibs on ""feel-cold"" movie of the year -- and youll also need to relax from the hard clench your body will have knotted itself into.The film stars Liam Neeson who at 59 goes more kick-butt in every film he makes. He plays Ottway a marksman who works for an oil company staving off the killer wolves that haunt the Alaskan drilling fields.When Neesons plane full of grumpy grungy drillers goes down deep in frozen tundra the crash makes the one in Lost seem bucolic by comparison. A pack of enormous wolves defending a den doesnt welcome the presence of the scant tribe of survivors. These wolves seen at first as just a clutch of eerily glowing eyes and teeth in the darkness will erase all thoughts of that sweet little pup from Dances With Wolves.Dancing no. Shredding chomping slurping yes. The Grey fully earns its R rating with not only repeated bloody attacks by angry canines but also a horrifyingly realistic drowning and fall down a mountain through trees. Youll feel every single bone-breaking branch.Director-writer Joe Carnahan keeps the shots tight and fast giving viewers an uncanny feeling of intimacy. Teensy bits of humor ease the sense of doom as when one survivor admits ""Im really more of a cat person.""Neeson easily carries the movie abetted by a terrific supporting cast especially Dallas Roberts. Neesons Ottway is fierce but he doesnt let macho gruffness get in the way of emotion and the performance should be remembered at Oscar time next year.If you can stand to sit through the very long credits theres a film snippet waiting at the end thats worth the wait.B+ Directed by Joe Carnahan.

"The Grey Liam Neeson is thrown to the wolves Slate Sign In Sign Up The Grey Everything You Could Reasonably Want From a Movie About Liam Neeson Fighting Wolves The Grey Everything You Could Reasonably Want From a Movie About Liam Neeson Fighting Wolves Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 26 2012 652 PM The Grey Hot Neeson-on-wolves action. By Dana Stevens Still of Liam Neeson in The Grey. Photo by Kimberley French. (c) 2011 - OpenRoad. All rights reserved. Joe Carnahans The Grey (Open Road Films) provides everything you could reasonably want from a January release about Liam Neeson fighting wolves. That may sound like faint praise but the truth is I pretty much loved this movie from start to finish--risible implausibilities insufficiently explained premise and all. An admirably spare survival thriller The Grey (nice title) abounds in qualities that are rare in movies of its type. Its quiet contemplative and almost haiku-like in its simplicity. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. ""Haiku-like"" is a curious adjective to find oneself applying to a movie with multiple graphic scenes of human and lupine evisceration. I dont mean to suggest that The Grey is some sort of chin-stroking art film--if youre in it for the Neeson-on-wolf action you will be amply provided for. But this efficient man vs. nature battle fantasy also doubles as a surprisingly somber meditation on some pretty huge (and unanswerable) questions When disaster strikes why do some people live and others die? What kind of debt do the living owe the dead? How is it possible to maintain ones faith or even the courage to keep going in the midst of great grief and suffering? When if ever is it the right time to just give up? Giving up is not something that comes easy to The Greys hero Ottway played by Neeson. (We wont learn the characters first name until a key scene near the movies end.) Ottway works as a sharpshooter at a remote oil-drilling outpost in Alaska picking off wolves that come close enough to endanger the workers. That job description is pretty much all we know about Ottway other than the fact that hes suicidal After writing a note to a lost love addressed only as ""Dearest One"" he prepares to shoot himself with his own rifle but takes the gun out of his mouth when he hears a wolf howl close by. Does Ottway choose to go on living at that moment because hes reminded of his moral duty to protect his fellow workers because he doesnt want a wolf to scavenge his corpse the moment he dies or for some other reason? Its never clear but his commitment to survival is about to be put to an even harsher test. Advertisement The next day (for reasons that also remain vague) Ottway and a group of men from the drilling site board a plane to Anchorage. The plane crashes in a scene thats all the more frightening for being unadornedly realistic--no suspenseful music or clever editing just a lot of screaming people in a metal tube falling through space. Only seven men survive the wreck--a tally that will rapidly begin to diminish as the survivors discover theyve landed on the hunting grounds of a pack of highly territorial wolves. In a choice that may have been financially motivated but turned out to be aesthetically smart Carnahan barely shows the wolves at all. What we do see of the predatory pack is a combination of CGI puppet animation and trained live animals. But with the memorable exception of a few scary fight scenes we experience the wolves mainly in the form of ungodly offscreen howls and green glowing eyes in the dark. As the groups resident wolf expert and all-around badass Ottway soon becomes their de facto leader. This does not sit well with Diaz (Frank Grillo) a blustering macho ex-con who challenges Ottways quiet authority at every turn. Among the other survivors are family man Talget (an unrecognizable and terrific Dermot Mulroney) cowardly loudmouth Flannery (an amusingly hyper Joe Anderson) and the mysteriously taciturn Henrick (Dallas Roberts). For no other reason than to do something about their hideous plight the men resolve to trek across the tundra to a distant tree-lined mountain hoping to encounter either civilization or at least better cover along the way. From there on in almost nothing can be revealed about the central question gripping both the audience and these frightened men Which of them will live and which will die? The Greys obsessive focus on this question along with its episodic bouts of sudden gruesome violence may make it seem to some viewers like a sadistic pick-em-off exploitation film. But unlike in Carnahans earlier film SmokinAces (he also directed Narc and The A-Team) every death in The Grey is experienced as a singular tragic and unrepeatable event That person who was there a minute ago is gone. Theres an extraordinary scene early on in which just after the crash Neesons character gently encourages a dying man to let go and accept his fate as his fellow survivors look on in stunned horror. An hour in you start to realize that that small but powerful moment was a template for the entire movie. The latest chapter in Liam Neesons remarkable late-career self-reinvention as a credible and magnetic action hero--the man is get this ladies nearly 60 years old--The Grey cant help but evoke memories of Neesons real-life tragedy the loss of his wife Natasha Richardson in a freak skiing accident in 2009. From the aching letter Ottway writes to an absent beloved in the films early scenes to the many moments he must adjust himself to a new reality of mourning as his companions die one by one this is a movie not only about death but about grief. Carnahan has said that the younger men he considered for the part ""didnt understand their own mortality."" Neeson brings that hard-won understanding to painfully vivid life on-screen turning what could have been a stock manly-man role into something much deeper and richer. For all its macho standoffs and action set pieces and menacing off-screen howling The Grey is at heart a simple moral fable about how true heroism consists in helping other human beings to live as long and die as well as they can which is after all the task all of us face each day even when were not fending off wolves with broken glass duct-taped to our knuckles.

As a police psychologist works to talk down an ex-con who is threatening to jump from a Manhattan hotel rooftop the biggest diamond heist ever committed is in motion. Video courtesy of Summit Entertainment. By John Anderson January 27 2012 It wont make his publicists happy to hear it but Sam Worthington is easily the biggest movie star in the world who wouldnt be recognized if he walked down a Manhattan street. Or if he climbed out onto the ledge of an East Side hotel and stood there for 100 minutes. Which is strange considering that he was the star of the biggest movie in the world (""Avatar"") and the 160th biggest movie in the world (""Terminator Salvation"") and that he appeared last year in a mixed bag of features that included ""The Debt"" ""Last Night"" and ""Texas Killing Fields."" ENLARGE Sam Worthington in Man on a Ledge Summit Entertainment But his Everyman-ish qualities serve him well in ""Man on a Ledge"" director Asger Leths wryly twisted caper film. Mr. Worthington is a colossus of anonymity. ""Man on a Ledge"" is a movie that employs all the mechanics of a standard Hollywood thriller while taking sidelong glances at the same voyeurism that fuels both the film and cinema itself. Its not ""Rear Window"" The ending for instance is so ridiculously tidy it squeaks. But en route to its kitchen-sink climax ""Man"" manages to both amuse and provoke to cleave to convention and promote ideas. And it isnt in 3-D. Theaters may want to consider charging triple admission. We meet Mr. Worthingtons Nick Cassidy as he emerges from the subway at Sixth Avenue crosses a city abuzz with anonymous life checks into a room at the matronly Roosevelt Hotel and eats the greater part of a mediocre meal. He then wipes down every surface hes touched and climbs out the window. It isnt long before hes spotted by the crowd on Madison Avenue and not much longer before police detectives including the acerbic Jack Dougherty (Ed Burns) realize that there isnt a fingerprint in the room by which to identify their would-be leaper. And that this is no ordinary suicide attempt. Its just a theory of course but the sign of a worthy thriller may be how eagerly you want to revisit it just to see where you went wrong--or where the movie did in timing its narrative twists and ""aha"" moments and in providing sufficient information that one doesnt feel hoodwinked by holes in the plot. ""Man on a Ledge"" takes its sweet time explaining Nicks problem and his intended solution doling out relevant details like state secrets. But the structure seems sound and it isnt giving anything away to disclose what viewers almost immediately learn via flashback That Nick was an ex-cop serving 25-years at Sing Sing where he fought with other inmates and revealed to the prison psychiatrist that yes he thinks about killing himself all the time. What follows is a hair-raising escape involving an SUV and a freight train after which Nick concocts the grand design that brings him 200 feet above midtown. Mr. Leth the son of renowned Danish documentarian Jorgen Leth has directed only one other film ""Ghosts of Cite Soleil"" a highly stylized doc that revealed a soul yearning to breathe free of nonfiction. He has an instinct for weaving sturdy narrative fabric out of intersecting plot lines While Nick keeps the city gawking his brother Joey (Jamie Bell) and Joeys girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez) are busy breaking into the building across the street owned by evil real-estate titan David Englander (Ed Harris). The police suicide specialist called to the scene Lydia (Elizabeth Banks) has her own set of problems She recently failed to talk another ex-cop off the Brooklyn Bridge so shes dubbed ""the grim reaper"" by her less-enlightened colleagues. Meanwhile Nicks old partner Mike (Anthony Mackie) knows the whole story behind the stunt going on up above. So were watching the enormously talented Mr. Mackie even more intently than usual. Amid the hoopla Mr. Leth takes sobering assessment of media-circuses and mob mentalities The people down below taking cellphone pictures the ones yelling ""Jump""; the callous nature of cops for whom its all routine. Theres the occasional goofy grace note Kyra Sedgwick playing a voracious and obviously Anglo television reporter named Suzie Morales rolls the R in her surname as she signs off just in case someone missed the point (weve all heard it). In another scene Mr. Leth takes such pains to strip the shapely Ms. Rodriguez down to her underwear that audiences who may well be leering will also be laughing at how obvious it is. There is a lot to forgive it must be said Myriad coincidences a ridiculous helicopter scene cops taking hip-shots throughout the hallways of the Roosevelt Hotel. But there are deft touches too When Lydia orders Jack out of the hotel so she can talk privately to the man on the ledge Mr. Burnss voice jumps up an octave just as it might if the man behind it felt threatened by a woman. Its the kind of parenthetical subtlety one doesnt expect from many mainstream movies but especially one working so hard for exclamation points. The Grey ENLARGE Liam Neeson in The Grey Open Road Films The gas-refinery roughneck workers heading home from Alaska in Joe Carnahans ""The Grey"" face disasters of near biblical proportions. When their plane goes down it crashes onto a tract of uncharted tundra rips itself asunder and kills most of the passengers save for a half-dozen traumatized survivors. They have little food little hope and are marooned in a gale-force blizzard in which they can barely think much less act. Also there are wolves. The reassuring factor in all this is Ottway who was the companys hired killer Before the crash he had spent his days shooting predators around the perimeter of the refinery and morosely obsessing about the woman he lost. He knows a lot about wolves which helps as does the fact that hes played by Liam Neeson whose physical authority has always been one of his great assets. One gets the sense that they all might live through it even if Ottway has to carry them on his back. Mr. Carnahan has till now been pigeonholed and rightly by comedy shoot-em-ups like ""Smokin Aces"" and ""The A-Team."" But here he is with ""The Grey""--certainly an adventure film but one with a spiritual ingredient that is both surprising and fiercely resonant. Albert Nobbs ENLARGE Mia Wasikowska and Glenn Close in Albert Nobbs Roadside Attractions Were one to approach ""Albert Nobbs"" with absolutely no foreknowledge of its premise or plot the effect would be bewildering. Say isnt that Glenn Close? Why in the world is she dressed so oddly? And why is everyone calling her Mr. Nobbs? Ah youd say Ms. Close--for whom this Rodrigo Garcia-directed soap opera has just earned a 30th or 40th Oscar nomination--is playing a woman who for years has lived as a man working as a butler in a turn-of-the-20th-century Dublin hotel. And one would assume that even in the Ireland of a hundred-odd years ago people could tell a woman from a man. Many leaps of faith are required for the watching of this novelty film adapted from a short story by George Moore (""The Singular Life of Albert Nobbs"") and one which has attracted quite a bit of attention from gay-oriented journals sites organizations and critics. All of whom ignore the fact that Ms. Closes impersonation is utterly preposterous. A short haircut cannot conceal her sex nor can all the bindings in the world nor apparently a generous troweling of makeup. The masquerade works a bit better for the strapping Janet McTeer who plays Alberts fellow transvestite a housepainter who goes by the name of Hubert Page and opens Alberts eyes to possibilities hed never thought existed. Hubert is married to a woman named Cathleen (Bronagh Gallagher) and Albert is dumbstruck How did she/he do it? As he saves his pence and nurtures his modest dream of opening a tobacco shop he is overcome with hope Might he have a wife someday to man the counter in his store? Its a poignant tale one played for maximum mawkishness and one that relies at least a little on a belief that Alberts pretense might actually work. ""Albert Nobbs"" is the kind of thing an actress does with an Oscar in her cross hairs and as one of this weeks five Best Actress nominees Ms. Close is considerably closer to her goal. As an experiment in Academy Award psychology ""Albert Nobbs"" is fascinating. As drama? It is forgive us a drag. The Theatre Bizarre Even hard-core movie buffs may be oblivious to the world of horror/fantasy cinema that flourishes just below the surface of mainstream respectability--one that exists largely on DVD or at events like the Fantasia festival in Montreal or Fantastic Fest in Austin Texas. As a macabre primer to this parallel universe we suggest ""The Theatre Bizarre"" a portmanteau both ghastly and intelligent featuring a murderers row of contemporary horrors more prominent practitioners. Producer David Gregorys conceit was to set half a dozen directors free to explore the traditions of Grand Guignol. The results--from among others South African cult director Richard Stanley makeup wizard Buddy Giovinazzo and the talented Douglas Buck--are alternately shocking shockingly existential and/or tender in ways that belie stereotypes. When horror makes it to the mall its generally a mess. ""The Theatre Bizarre"" may not be everyones cup of tea. But within its genre its state-of-the-art. --Mr. Anderson contributes film criticism and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD Focus ENLARGE Dog Day Afternoon (1975) Based on the celebrated Brooklyn bank robbery of the summer of 1972 director Sidney Lumets classic New York drama stars Al Pacino whose Sonny Wortzik wants to get money for his boyfriends sex-change operation and winds up with a bank full of innocent bystanders. Mr. Lumets melding of hostage negotiation media circus and the rather tender portrayal of his principal holdup men added up to a biting societal critique and set a standard often imitated and seldom equaled. Trivia buffs will remember that Mr. Pacinos co-star the late John Cazale made only five movies but each was nominated for a Best Picture Oscar. Phone Booth (2003) Colin Farrell plays the sleazy New York publicist pinned down by a sniper (Kiefer Sutherland) in this Joel Schumacher-directed thriller written by Larry Cohen. Mr. Cohen had been cultivating the idea for years (hed even suggested it to Alfred Hitchcock) and by the time the film finally got made cellphones had rendered phone booths nearly obsolete. Still there are moments of terror and a genuine sense of the New York streets even if much of the atmosphere seemed to have been imported from the 1970s. Radha Mitchell Katie Holmes and Forest Whitaker co-star. Safety Last (1923) A silent masterpiece in which Harold Lloyds climb up the outside of a Los Angeles department store culminates in the famous ""clock scene"" in which he dangles from the big hand while accelerating audience heartbeats. The stunt was only a little less dangerous than it looks and careful viewers will spot the glove Mr. Lloyd wore one on his right hand disguising the missing thumb and index finger he lost in a 1919 bomb explosion. Likewise visitors to Graumans Chinese Theatre in Hollywood will notice that Lloyds right hand made a lighter impression than his left when pressed into the wet cement outside. --John Anderson 15 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Kimberley French/Open Road Films hide caption toggle caption Kimberley French/Open Road Films The Grey Director Joe Carnahan Genre Action Drama Running Time 117 minutes Rated R for violence/disturbing content including bloody images and for pervasive language With Liam Neeson Dermot Mulroney Frank Grillo Watch Clips From  The Grey - No One Will Find Us No One Will Find Us Credit Open Road Films From The Grey - The Pack The Pack Credit Open Road Films Pity the foolhardy wolf that gets in Liam Neesons way. At least thats the primary message in the trailer for the latest entry in this most curious period of the Oscar-nominees career which finds him more often than not furrowing his brow in anger and then beating the source of his ire to a bloody pulp. To wit The coming-attractions reel for The Grey showcases Neeson securing shattered single-serve liquor bottles to his knuckles with electrical tape while a massive snarling gray wolf awaits their alpha vs. alpha death match. This movie it would appear is looking for the same gravitas-laced trash appeal that made Neesons over-the-top revenge fantasy Taken such a guilty pleasure. But thats just the marketing spin The Grey has more than a few surprises in store. It has its excesses true and Neeson does do his fair share of looking tough and taking out big bad wolves. But both star and writer-director Joe Carnahan have done better this time than in their last joint effort the execrable time-waster The A-Team. Neeson plays John Ottway a roughneck working the northern Alaska oil rigs; hes tasked with keeping watch with a sniper rifle taking out any wildlife dangers that might stalk the men on the oil fields. Carnahan has him introduce his line of work in an opening voiceover that in its grimly matter-of-fact yet stoically poetic tone sounds like an outtake from Werner Herzogs recent Antarctic documentary. As Ottway muses its a ""job at the end of the world"" populated by ""men unfit for mankind."" With the studied efficiency of a man who knows that his audience showed up to see Neeson glass-knuckle-boxing with wolves Carnahan quickly establishes Ottway as a sad loner his wife long gone with no will to live outside of his role as camp protector. But remarkably once the plane Ottway boards in the first few minutes goes down in arctic Alaska -- leaving just seven men to survive the elements and the vicious territoriality of the local wolf pack -- Carnahan doesnt give us quite the tough-guy action spectacle we might expect. In its place is a stark and contemplative downcast film that is willing to sit remarkably still for an action film and willing to deny some of the audiences blood lust by turning the camera away at key moments. Its far from perfect lets note. Carnahan working from a script that he and writer Ian Mackenzie Jeffers adapted from Jeffers short story ""Ghost Walkers"" paints everything with a broad archetypal brush. The seven survivors fit neat categories from the quiet pragmatist Hendrick (Dallas Roberts) to Talget (Dermot Mulroney) the surprisingly sensitive father who just loves his little girl back home to Diaz (Frank Grillo) the chest-puffing ex-con afraid of nothing. Carnahan telegraphs the order in which the wolves will pick them off with how much each respective man has to learn or to lose. As for the wolves Carnahan isnt looking to make an effects-driven film so the digitally created beasties are often off-camera. Keeping them largely hidden in the shadows allows him to keep the film to a modest budget while still making them a frightening force of evil. Slightly too evil in fact In trying to create parallels between the wolf pack and the interactions of the men in their own ""pack"" Carnahan blatantly anthropomorphizes the animals to the point where their behavior seems far too calculated. Still The Grey has a certain muscular pull Its a tough-as-nails study of hardened men struggling with the ostensibly conflicting pulls of stoic masculinity on one hand and love faith and fear of death on the other. It has its own stoic resolve which combined with the grainy color-drained cinematography of Masanobu Takayanagi gives it the feel of something out of the 70s. Minus some of Carnahans clumsier inclinations one could easily imagine this as a lesser but thoroughly enjoyable work from Sam Peckinpah or John Sturges. The movie might not be a vengeance-driven wolf-man cage fight but in subverting those escapist expectations it sinks its teeth far deeper and more memorably.

Well maybe somebody can but in The Grey - a wilderness survival story set in a subzero snowbound Alaska - the imposing actor offers the following poem turning its rhyming resignation into something that almost feels um meaningful More about The Grey >> Once more into the fray Into the last good day and night Live and die on this day Live and die on this day . . . Neeson is John Ottway a damaged gent who works as a marksman for an oil-drilling team. If a predator - a bear a wolf - gets too close to his coworkers Ottway takes out his rifle and lays the creature down. Its ""a job at the end of the world"" Neeson says in his introductory voice-over and as we discover theres a reason hes chosen to live in such bleak bone-chilling ways. Until one day when after a few stiff drinks he decides he doesnt need to live this way - or any way - anymore. He takes his gun goes out into the blizzarding night and puts the barrel to his mouth. But that doesnt happen either. The Grey directed with macho vigor by Joe Carnahan (The A-Team Smokin Aces) soon finds Ottway on a plane with a bunch of rowdy and uncouth colleagues. Its an R amp; R flight but the aircraft hits turbulence and then goes nose down turning into a D amp; D - death and destruction - trip. The crash is one of the more harrowing cinema reenactments of an aviation nightmare from the eerie silence when the engines shut off and the windows fog up to the hard jolts of the fuselage breaking apart. The Grey isnt likely to be on any airlines in-flight entertainment menu. There are seven men who survive the crash and then there are six and so on. Ottway thanks to his training as a hunter and the fact hes the lead guy in Carnahans script takes charge trying to figure out how to get through the fierce frozen forests - and how to avoid being eaten by a pack of seriously angry wolves. Mixing CG effects puppeteering and real trained animals these snarling canids are kind of scary - theyre like Twilights pack of shape-shifting wolves only without the Team Jacob T-shirts. And excuse the pun they dog Ottway and his quaking crew (Dallas Roberts Frank Grillo Dermot Mulroney) relentlessly. The Grey whose clipped title grim swagger and lost-in-the-outback themes conjure up visions of that Alec Baldwin/Anthony Hopkins classic The Edge devolves into a predictable man-against-nature and man-against-fellow man affair. There are witty nods to other such films (Werner Herzogs Grizzly Man Ethan Hawkes Andes plane crash-cannibal tale Alive) but the wit stops there. The stunts become more preposterous the computer-rendered snowy chasms more impossibly fake the haunted look in Neesons eye more tragic and soul-torn. Once more into the fray . . .

The thrills are there to be sure but ""The Grey"" periodically pauses the action to provide actual character development and dramatic interplay mostly to the films benefit. Neeson stars as Ottway a man torn apart over the estrangement of his wife (Anne Openshaw who appears in several flashbacks and dream sequences) and working on an oil field in a remote stretch of Alaska shooting the native wolves if they get too close. When an Anchorage-bound airplane carrying Ottway and a bunch of roughnecks on an Ramp;R weekend crashes in the middle of nowhere the small band of survivors struggle to survive the elements as well as a pack of wolves thats in pursuit. Director Joe Carnahan (""Narc"" ""Smokin Aces"") keeps much of the proceedings brooding and quiet making loud moments -- like the vivid plane crash a scene that will definitely rattle anyone whos phobic about flying -- stand out all the more. Carnahans screenplay (written with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers based on the latters short story) artfully balances character-based drama with elements of the slasher movie (people get picked off one by one with Mother Nature instead of Freddy Krueger as the killer) and World War II foxhole epic (Ottways fellow survivors include the Loud Guy the Sensitive Guy the African-American Guy the Nice Latino the Selfish Latino and the Dermot Mulroney). Not all of the characters are quite as interesting or fully fleshed-out as they might be but ""The Grey"" gets away with interrupting the tension in an attempt to make its ensemble more human. Ottway of course gets the greatest amount of largesse from the screenplay and we do get one or two third-act revelations about him that are genuinely surprising. This is one of those movies where its definitely worth finding a theater with the best sound system possible -- that plane crash feels all the more immediate thanks to sound designer Bob Kellough and his team of course but their work also makes everything from the relentless wind on the tundra to the distant howls of the hungry wolves rattle through your ribcage. Apart from one unbelievably superhuman feat (that conveniently takes place off-camera) the men of ""The Grey"" respond to their peril in all-too-mortal ways either slipping up creatively addressing the situation or even literally giving up the ghost when they realize that theyre just too exhausted to continue. The film however never lets up keeping the suspense going even after the closing credits have rolled. (Sit through them for the films final coda incidentally.) Memories of ""The Grey"" will probably melt away before springs first sunny day but its the kind of movie that will satisfy both fans of Neesons serious performances in films like ""Kinsey"" and those who line up for his more recent spate of I-will-kill-everyone flicks.

Moviegoers in January. Ignoring the snootier Oscar fare we patronize winter genre films the oversize spawn of antique B pictures. We get an education too becoming experts in the fine points of exorcism (The Devil Inside) smuggling (Contraband) and vampire-Lycan enmity (Underworld Awakening). January movies are like homework for misfits. Further instruction awaits the viewers of The Grey a suitably bleak-midwinter action movie whose syllabus includes the feeding habits of Alaskan wolves and the odd career choices of Liam Neeson. In his late fifties after playing Oskar Schindler Michael Collins Alfred Kinsey Jean Valjean Qui-Gon Jinn and Aslan the deitific Narnia lion this imposing slab of Irish manhood turned himself into a wintertime action hero in Taken and Unknown. In The Grey his boldest frostbite statement yet Neeson plays Ottway a professional wolf-hunter on an Alaskan oilrig. When the plane carrying him and some other gruff souls crashes and the seven survivors are menaced by ferocious timber wolves Ottway declares himself the alpha male of the human pack and tries leading them to safety through the punishing snow. No question that Ottway is Neeson declaring himself king of the cold-weather movies. Its a title hes welcome to -- and whod dare fight him for it? (MORE See Corlisss reviews of Taken and Unknown) Director Joe Carnahan who worked with Neeson on The A-Team and shares screenplay credit here with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers the author of the original story gets a few things right. Start with the plane trip -- as tense a movie-aviation thrill ride since William Shatner saw gremlins on thee wing in the ""Nightmare at 20000 Feet"" episode of The Twilight Zone -- and the subsequent crash. After many men perish Ottway gently talks another victim nearing death into accepting his fate. ""Itll slide over you itll feel nice and warm"" he whispers. ""Who do you love?... Let her take you then."" In a movie full of dialogue that strains for ultimate meaning this is the one that gets there. The wolves first furtive appearances carry suspense and dread in the blackness of night a pair of yellow eyes blinks on; then quickly six other pairs -- silent watchful killers massing to attack. At other times they make their presence known as soundtrack specters (basso-profundo growls and coloratura howls) or through visual talismans (a victims blood filling a pawprint in the snow). The location shooting in farthest British Columbia conveys the puny helplessness of the men hiding in their aircraft rubble. If only they were a few provinces eastward Neeson could channel Samuel L. Jackson and thunder ""Ive had it with these Manitoba wolves near this Manitoba plane"" (MORE See Richard Schickels review of Snakes on a Plane) Mauled by one of the lupine intruders Ottway grins bitterly and says ""Maybe Ill turn into a wolf man."" But The Grey isnt a fanciful monster movie unless the men are the monsters. ""Youre not the animals"" the surliest of the survivors yells at the wolves pounding home the films central metaphor. ""Were the animals"" They are also the intruders on the wolves home turf foreign occupiers (like the Americans in Iraq or Afghanistan) faced with an indigenous lupine insurgency. Unable to communicate with their oilrig colleagues the men desperately need some kind of deus ex machine; but the helicopter carrying a rifle-totin wolf-shootin Sarah Palin never arrives. The dwindling cohort must confront nature and their own fears with the ordinary reserves of muscle and ingenuity. One ghost that lingers at the corners of this death-in-the-snow film is the late actress Natasha Richardson Neesons wife who died three years ago at 45 two days after what was originally thought to be a minor skiing accident in Quebec. Curiously in Neesons big projects of the last few years he has played a man robbed of the woman he loves. Ottways separation from his own beloved has driven him close to suicide and he remains tantalized by visions of his faraway sweetheart whispering pillow talk in his fever dreams. Any actor may have a dozen reasons for making or not making certain films and it may be sheer cruel coincidence that led him to Taken Unknown and The Grey. The Natasha connection may not trouble Neeson but it should haunt many viewers. (MORE Corlisss tribute to Natasha Richardson) If it ran about 80 mins. The Grey could be a smartish man-against-the-elements thriller. Unfortunately it ambles in at nearly two hours an arid expanse padded with sad stabs at characterization the noble black man (Nonso Anozie) the book lover (Dermot Mulroney unrecognizable behind Witness Protection spectacles) and the mouthy ex-con (Frank Grillo) whose endless grousing led one member of the preview audience to shout ""Hey wolves--kill him."" Two-thirds of the way unto the movie when just four men are left and the noose should be tightening they engage in an extended conversations that would allow you not just a concession-stand break but time to leave the theater drive home microwave some popcorn and drive back without missing a relevantly scary thing. True to its grim prospectus The Grey dwells in haunted machismo to the very end. Seriously you must sit through all of the end credits before learning whether man or beast wins the climactic battle. But the audience should be able to endure that final ordeal. After all theyre January moviegoers.

The titles of Liam Neesons recent solo vehicles - ""Taken ""Unknown and now ""The Grey - have been as economical as his acting in them. Theyre variations on the same idea. Hes on his own. He wants back what has been stolen from him respectively his daughter his identity his marriage. The last one should explain what we and Neeson are up against in ""The Grey. Its the most philosophical of these movies. Its also the most ambiguous.Neeson is John Ottway a sharpshooter doing security work at an Alaskan oil refinery. Hes broken up about his wife (Anne Openshaw) who in sunny flashbacks lies beside him in bed. (Is she the late Mrs. Ottway? The former? Oh the greyness of it all) Whatevers happened has turned him suicidal with heartsickness. Weve known this man 10 minutes and already hes putting his mouth around the barrel of a rifle. He manages to push on boarding a flight from the refinery along with some of the crew to some place presumably happier. They never make it. The plane crashes. Seven men survive only to be gradually picked off by freezing cold and wolves which were told are the only animals that seek revenge.Its cheap the way ""The Grey wants to be both a Liam Neeson ""Quit Taking My Stuff movie and an existential thriller about survival. Weve come in vain to see him danse-macabre with wolves and the films director Joe Carnahan provides the occasional horror-film sneak attack. He also manages to create one of the movies more nightmarish plane crashes and conclude with just the sort of ludicrous finale that paying customers whove seen the ads might assume they would be getting a whole film of. Its been 15 years since we fell for a similar trick when ""The Edge invited us to watch Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin go nose to nose with a bear. What we got was alpha-male opera from David Mamet.It turns out that the most interesting scenes in ""The Grey involve men - namely Neeson Dermot Mulroney Frank Grillo and Dallas Roberts - just sitting around missing their kids being sad that they have no idea where they are and that there are no women around to have sex with. These moments are interesting because they are human and thats not a quality I immediately associate with the director of ""Narc ""Smokin Aces and ""The A-Team.All this talking is a turning point which occurs around the time they are all forced to leap off a cliff. Carnahan wrote this movie with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers and thats a decent metaphor. Im afraid the transition doesnt produce a better movie necessarily just a more honest one. Of course honesty is all we get with Liam Neeson. ""Taken and ""Unknown were rigged to bring him to a boiling point. The limited fun in each was in tracing the path of a sparking fuse as it approaches the bomb.""The Grey doesnt require as much of Neesons blood pressure or his stunt double. Hes just aching and spiritually alone which alas might be too much honesty. Its been three years since his wife Natasha Richardson was killed in a skiing accident. Watching him fight in these movies for a center for who he is without the woman he no longer has can be a trial for us too. Closure is a rare thing yet Neeson keeps asking us to come and behold him attempt to achieve it. This very good career has entered a grim phase post-traumatic Sisyphus.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Grey"" yanked me upright in my seat. It is even as melodramatic and sometimes implausible entertainment the best studio movie in a long time. It follows the tradition of Jack Londons man vs. nature survival stories where hope is as fragile as a campfire in a blizzard. Here seven Alaska oilfield workers face bleak odds when their plane crashes far from civilization and near the den of a ferocious wolf pack. The film is unusually hard tense cruel intelligent and straightforward. While you watch it it entirely holds you. You quickly forget that its just a movie although as a movie its terrific. Liam Neeson plays Ottway a hunter hired by an oil company to keep predators away from its employees. When the crash survivors wrestle with their shock at finding themselves lost in the middle of nowhere Ottway is the alpha male who barks the orders. When aggressive wolves venture close hes the one who offers a plan of action. But the film gives us reasons to question his judgment. He is beset by painful memories of his departed wife a broken man who must battle his suicidal urges for the others sake. The supporting characters are thoughtfully written and cleverly cast the actors burrowing in deeply. They register as realistic individuals not stereotypes. Frank Grillo is strong as a belligerent contrarian Dermot Mulroney all but unrecognizable as a survivor yearning for his daughter. Each has his own reason for pressing ahead in the face of disaster his own weaknesses and reserves of courage. Each has his own reaction to the sudden annihilating loneliness and fear. Indifferent fate treats them all as equals. ""The Grey"" is not the type of picture in which heroism is calculated to land buttered side up. The challenges facing the men are primitive. Finding shelter. Making weapons. Traversing a canyon and crossing river rapids. The movie is almost documentary in its portrayal of hardship and hard work. ""The Grey"" is a harrowing adventure story but it is more an exploration of character as revealed in action. There are problems with the film but they are small in the overall scheme. A plane that goes down over land in the United States would have been tracked by radar and a rescue team would scramble immediately. Its very uncommon for wolves to attack humans. But the drama is worth the large suspension of disbelief. Open Road Films Star Tribune Liam Neeson in ""The Grey"" This is a big step up for writer/director Joe Carnahan working in virile style after the sophomoric guff of ""The A Team."" The camera is always where it needs to be never belabors or over-dramatizes its subject never strains for beauty or profundity. There is not a shot for its own sake in the picture or one too arranged-looking or dwelt on too long. Neeson proves that a comfortably successful actor well on in his career can still be excitingly capable of further growth. I dont think the title of ""The Grey"" refers to the alpha timberwolf but to Neesons character. The film is never stronger than when it silently focuses on his weathered wind-beaten face. ccovertstartribune.com 612-673-7186 colincovert View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Thought the screenplay was fantastic and much more of a meditation on mortality... Liam still kicks major butt. The penultimate drowning scene... And what a final shot ""Once more in to the fray..."" Edsaid on Tuesday August 07 2012 85123 AMOne of only 2 critics with whom I listen to and read their reviews when seeing or renting a movie. You seem to like movies in a good way have fun with them and see them the way I do. Unlike most critics Who have never written anything creative and thrive on selfworth but writing scathing reviews which are neither helpful nor correct. Thanks Richard. Keep up the great work mac mcraesaid on Thursday February 16 2012 114913 PMwhat amazes me about most reviews of this movie is how luke warm they are. movie reviewers are so jaded. compared to action movies from the 80s this is highart. such beautiful camera work and top notch acting. many movie ""classics"" like EMPIRE and Romancing the Stone are just laughably bad compared to this.

The one caveat to seeing ""The Grey"" is the portrayal of the wolves. Man has virtually eradicated the wolf around the world-it only survives in small pockets and even there is being persecuted (Alaska is an example). Yet here it is shown as a kind of malevolent monster actively pursing humans as prey. The real monsters are humans-not the wolf. One only hopes viewers of this movie will not react to it as they did ""Jaws"" in the 1970s which saw untold numbers of sharks massacred as a result.

(Kimberley French) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday January 26 2012 1200 PM Title The Grey Film Info R Violence language. At area theaters. Those rabid eyes that snarling face barely concealing a glimpse of tooth as he stalks with a coiled intensity. Anything can happen if he springs. A wild wolf? No -- Liam Neeson a guy even wolves should be scared of in the gripping thriller ""The Grey."" With a bellyful of lite Hemingway - most of the films do-or-die decisions are followed by serene acceptance of rugged death - and a heavy soul that never drags it down director Joe Carnahans great adventure follows Neesons lead and stays steely to the end even as its grizzled winners take nothing. Neesons sharpshooter John Ottway works for an Alaskan refinery shooting animals that threaten the oil rig workers. En route to a job a rickety plane carrying Ottway and what he calls a standard crew (criminals ex-cons ""the a--holes of the world"") crashes in the wilderness. The handful of wounded men must quickly figure out how to survive. Each hour that gets harder. Building fires and finding food is tough enough. Fighting off packs of white wolves is the real threat as well as snowstorms a miles-high gorge and fights that could tear them apart before they can cross a river into the trees and get closer they hope to civilization. Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers screenplay based on Jeffers novel has some of the same man-vs.-nature elements as ""Flight of the Phoenix"" ""The Edge"" ""Alive"" ""The Way Back"" and Jon Krakauers book ""Into Thin Air."" It is in the best sense like a mens adventure magazine splashed on the big screen. In addition to a sturdy crew of supporting actors including good turns from Dermot Mulroney Dallas Roberts and Frank Grillo there are also haunting snippets of Ottways lost love memories of an emotionally distant father and shouted challenges to any almighty force. (""Fine Ill do it myself"" Ottway mutters when no miracles arrive to save him.) The gristle inside this movie is one of the things that save it from being simply a series of challenges. Neeson is perfect for this stuff. There have been high points among his ""paycheck roles"" over the last few years yet its seemed to an outsider like he may have been escaping into big-budget work as a way of coping with his own personal tragedy the death of wife Natasha Richardson in 2009. Well never know of course but if that is the case heres hoping that ""The Grey"" with its dark themes and gut-level grappling of courage and loss helps bring him back where he belongs.

"The Grey movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Grey a Liam Neeson howler in a good way -- 3 starsJanuary 26 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticLiam Neeson stars in ""The Grey.""The title ""8 Million Ways to Die"" was already taken so ""The Grey"" had to settle for ""The Grey"" named for the plus-size wolves waging war on the desperate human survivors of an Alaskan wilderness plane crash. Tough situation. Frostbite. Wolf bite. Drowning. Falling from great heights. Harsh outcomes abound for both man and beast.And yet the film takes some time to let its characters ruminate by way of dialogue on their circumstances which gives ""The Grey"" a distinctly late-20th-century feel. The film stars Liam Neeson a bona fide 59-year-old action hero as an oil refinery sharpshooter charged with keeping predators at bay. Working from a short story by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers who wrote the scripts first draft co-writer and director Joe Carnahan places the formidable Neeson in the middle of a scary and bracing picture with more on its mind than advertised. Some of ""The Grey"" is phony and it was a mistake to make the rogue wolves large enough to be mistaken for critters out of ""Twilight."" But Carnahan is smart enough to keep full-view images of the antagonists in check. And theres an actual human element to go with Carnahans Jack London-inspired depiction of humans against the elements.We meet Neesons character a heartbroken loner named John Ottway on the verge of suicide and thinking back obsessively to the woman who got away. His demons temporarily quelled Ottway boards a small plane with his fellow refinery workers and in one of the most nerve-racking flights ever put on film the aircraft runs afoul of bad weather and crashes. (For a turbulence wimp like me this scene was not easy.)Eight survive at first. Ottway the alpha male knows what hes doing. So does the alpha male of the wolf pack on their trail. The rest of the humans are played by an interesting ensemble of nonstars including Dermot Mulroney Dallas Roberts Nonso Anozie Frank Grillo and others. The film shrewdly does not tip its hand about whos living and whos dying.Carnahan indulges himself in ways most filmmakers would avoid He gives several of the men for example extended soul-searching discussions about Gods existence (or not) about owning up to ones fears about the precarious nature of love. The best parts of ""The Grey"" connect the interior lives of these roughnecks with their newfound and lethal obstacles to safety. Carnahan made ""Smokin Aces"" (which I hated) and""The A-Team""(which wasnt bad actually); wisely he shot and edited ""The Grey"" like neither of those pictures. This ones more relaxed in its rhythms a brooding drama about a brooding man in a terrible situation. Only occasionally are there computer-generated ravines that must be leapt across; thankfully much of the action was shot in northern British Columbia and a lot of the wind and snow and scenery is real. My favorite shot of Carnahans is a close-up on Mulroneys face as he waits in line behind Neeson for a tricky ravine crossing. Most directors wouldnt care much about the supporting actor; theyd be too worried about fluffing up the leads heroics.Neeson holds it together from first to last. He is the rumbly voiced king of the late-January/early February action film per ""Taken"" and""Unknown""and by now moviegoers have been subliminally conditioned to pay money to hear that warm hearth of a speaking voice under duress but coolly so this time of year. Call ""The Grey"" ""Deliverance"" Lite with snow and wolves. And call it a solid January surprise.mjphillipstribune.comThe Grey -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for violence/disturbing content including bloody images and for pervasive language)Running time 157Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated Articles3 Days to Kill Director McG Weighs in on Kevin Costner...February 13 2014New A-Team A-ZJanuary 15 2010A-Team ready to rumble righteouslyJune 10 201080s movie reduxApril 4 2010Find More Stories AboutRefineryPlane CrashLiam NeesonWolf PackTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0124-the-grey-20120126,0,2419038.column",200,thegrey23,thegrey,chicagotribune

Liam Neeson is a tough loner who rallies a group of strangers after their plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness; the other survivors include Frank Grillo James Badge Dale and Dermot Mulroney in a stunning performance. Like Anthony Manns The Naked Spur (1953) or Man of the West (1958) the movie draws on the terrifying beauty of the natural world and generates tension from the volatile dynamics of a carefully observed group.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet There was a time when Liam Neeson as a sensitive magazine editor in Woody Allens Husbands And Wives looked so intimidated by the likes of Mia Farrow and Judy Davis that his 64"" frame seemed as brittle as papier-mache. Even Darkman which cast him as a vengeful urban hero emphasized his intense vulnerability and inner torment. Now after an unlikely series of action vehicles Neeson has evolved into a steely inscrutable tough guy in the Clint Eastwood/Charles Bronson mold and its this character who approaches parody in The Grey the ultimate in Movies For Guys Who Like Movies. Director Joe Carnahan having already cast Neeson as the cigar-chomping ringleader Hannibal in The A-Team uses him again in the macho role of a grizzled working stiff who squares off against nature and beast in a primal battle of wills. Perhaps appropriately its pitched like a wolfs howl. Sounding like the hard-bitten narrator of a justly forgotten film noir Neeson relays via voiceover the outlaw culture of the oil company where he works in deepest Alaska as well as the personal despair that brought him to this godforsaken outpost. A sharpshooter who tries and fails to turn his gun on himself Neeson has to fight for survival when a transport plane crashes leaving him and half a dozen other men stranded in the middle of snowbound nowhere. Worse yet theyre in wolf territory and the animals are so provoked by their presence that theyre apparently willing to hunt the intruders down Jaws The Revenge-style across territory stretching roughly from Anchorage to Santa Claus. Meanwhile theres dissension in the ranks as not all of these rugged individualists are willing to accept Neeson as their de facto leader. The interaction between the men amounts to little more than a few tortured backstories and some high-toned discussions about the existence of God all punctuated by the occasional CGI wolf attaching itself to someones neck. Though Carnahan dials up the testosterone to comically absurd levels The Grey improves when the dialogue is distilled to a guttural yawp and the men are forced into wrestling with wolves or going MacGyver on the unforgiving elements. Neeson brings gravitas to the table acting as a legitimizing counterweight to the overwrought dialogue and flesh-tearing lupine hysteria. But in a scenario this persistently ludicrous he can only do so much.

Last winter in Unknown he played a brooding biochemist who fights tough to save his sanity and retain his own identity following a coma in Berlin. Two winters before that in Taken he played a brooding retired CIA agent who fights tough to save his daughter following her abduction in France. You see the pattern here? Winter-release slot + travel budget + Liam Neeson = slightly preposterous routinely violent apparently lucrative action movie in which the Irish-born star signals inner emotional conflict with his handsomely mashed boxers face while settling outer physical conflict with his boxers fists. Once we accept with some head-scratching that this is the lowbrow route (to riches presumably) chosen by a 59-year-old actor who once reached higher playing Oskar Schindler and Alfred Kinsey we are left only to compare these marketplace-driven projects for their entertainment value. And as Neeson No-Brainers go this one directed as if on a diet of testosterone injections and shots of absinthe by Neesons A-Team helmer Joe Carnahan is a reasonably entertaining loopy blend of brawny bonding and Samuel Beckett-approved rumination. The existential conundrum under discussion is What does it take to fight another day with no hope of salvation? The theme is reinforced whenever The Greys spectral CGI-created wolves come out beaming their Village of the Damned eyes at an ever-dwindling huddle of Alaskan-oil-refinery workers whove survived the dramatic Lost-worthy airplane crash. They might have been better off dying instantly. Neeson plays a loner named Ottway whose sharpshooting oil-field job was to protect the work site against wildlife attacks. Before the crash he was suicidal saved from self-destruction only by sun-dappled bedroomy memories of his loving wife. After the crash Ottway is the one who rallies the living sometimes just by growling at them with an Irish accent. He shares his survivalist skills with frightened angry men including a Swaggering Blowhard Ex-Con (Frank Grillo) a Large Gentle Black Man (Nonso Anozie) and a Reasonable Guy Who Reads (Dermot Mulroney almost unrecognizable behind bookworm eyeglasses). The starving freezing men struggle through snowdrifts fight wolves and philosophize around campfires. There are eight and then there are seven and then there are fewer than that. Ottway suffers terribly -- havent you seen those facial lacerations on the posters? He cant go on. He sees another vision of his wife tangled in sexy bedsheets. He goes on. So apparently do these Liam Neeson action passion plays as surely as a new year begins.

The Grey Fair to good Director Joe Carnahan. Cast Liam Neeson Dermot Mulroney Frank Grillo. Rating R for violence/disturbing content including bloody images and for pervasive language. This weeks new movie releases Thats what happens when you cast Liam Neeson as a sharpshooter crash-landed in the Alaskan wilderness with a bunch of societys rejects who are then hunted by wolves. But what you also get is something a little more thoughtful than it might otherwise have been -- something else you get when you cast Neeson. Interview Liam Neeson Yes the star of such movies as ""Schindlers List"" and ""Kinsey"" continues the path chosen when he signed on for ""Taken"" in which he became the unlikely action star of a surprising hit movie (which spawned an upcoming sequel). And funny enough hes good at this kind of thing. When he tells another character he will kick his ass in about five seconds if he doesnt straighten up you have no doubt he means it (nor does the character hes talking to). Dont be mistaken -- this isnt an artsy thriller. It is still at heart men vs. wolves and the wolves definitely have the home-court advantage. But director Joe Carnahan who co-wrote the script with Ian Mackenzie Jeffers based on Jeffers short story tries to infuse the proceedings with a what-is-life-worth vibe which is sporadically effective. John Ottway (Neeson) works at an ends-of-the-Earth oil refinery in Alaska protecting the place and its workers from wolves bears and other wild animals. The humans are practically as wild as the beasts Ottway informs us in voiceover people who came here to get away from their pasts or just to be left alone. Ottway fits into the latter camp suicidal over not being with his wife (Anne Openshaw seen in flashbacks). There is more to that story we learn but the effect is the same Life for Ottway is no longer worth living. Until that is he finds himself on a plane with the rest of the workers that crashes in a harrowing scene in the middle of frozen nowhere. Among the survivors are Ottway of course as well as Diaz (Frank Grillo) a short-tempered ex-con; Talget (Dermot Mulroney); Burke (Nonso Anozie); and Hendrick (Dallas Roberts). These are not exactly team players and they dont take well to Ottway seizing a leadership position. However it quickly becomes apparent that he is the only one of them with a working knowledge of wolves -- handy -- and their behavior. Behavior by the way the men soon start to mimic in subtle and then more obvious ways which is a nice way of saying Carnahan sometimes overplays this aspect of the film with Neeson explaining the concept of an alpha dog and then becoming one etc. In addition to the action there are long stretches of planning what to do as well as musing about how they have come to be in this position. Why did they survive the plane crash? Surely not to be eaten by wolves? You never know. ... Grillo manages to overcome a stock loud-mouth bad-guy role for the most part and Mulroney and Roberts are good as guys who seem at times almost bemused by their lot. (Anozie doesnt say much.) But Neeson carries the film as he carries the action in it. He provides a little existential longing to the movie -- and a lot of muscle and brawn.

(AP Photo/Open Road Films Kimberley French)-- AP+Read Caption In this film image released by Open Road Films from left Dallas Roberts Dermot Mulroney Liam Neeson and Nonso Anozie are shown in a scene from ""The Grey."" (AP Photo/Open Road Films Kimberley French) / APShare Photo How wonderfully unpredictable the movies can be. Who would have thought that at nearly 60 Liam Neeson would be one of the top action stars around? Its the same counterintuitive formula that made Michael Keaton a good Batman and the Rock a believable Tooth Fairy. But here he is again. After the thrillers ""Taken"" and ""Unknown"" Neeson that burly Irishman of such rock-em sock `em films as ""Kinsey"" and ""Schindlers List"" is back in his new genre of choice looking quite at home punching a wolf. In ""The Grey"" Neeson plays John Ottway a grizzled veteran of remote oil refineries where his specialty is shooting by sniper rifle wild animals that attack rig workers. What Neeson has is a resilient weariness with hard Irish eyes that come alive when challenged and boyishly soften around women. But Ottway has tired of his rough life an outcast - for undetermined reasons - from the woman he loves (Anne Openshaw) whom he recalls frequently in white visions of pillow-talk purity. The film directed by Joe Carnahan (""The A-Team"" ""Narc"") opens with Ottways lost musings ""Ive stopped doing this world any good."" Outside the mean-spirited revelry of his fellow roughneck workers he prepares to kill himself only to be called back to the world by the howl of a wolf - something not unlike Jack Londons ""call of the wild."" En route to vacation in Anchorage the workers - a rough crew of facial hair and flannel - pile into an airplane that hits a storm crashes violently and leaves just seven alive in the middle of the snowy Alaskan tundra. Call it ""Lost The Winter Edition."" Ottway well versed in both survival and death takes charge. Their predicament deathly cold and with little hope of rescue becomes considerably worse when a pack of wolves announce themselves by their eerie glowing eyes on the dark fringes of their campfire. From there ""The Grey"" (By AP style it should be called ""The Gray"" with the more Americanized usage but whats a vowel when wolves are lurking?) is a survivalist thriller where the ever-dwindling band of survivors claw for safety away from the relentless pursuit of the wolves. The group includes the sensitive Henrick (Dallas Roberts) and the conscientious religious father Talget (a bearded bespectacled and nearly unrecognizable Dermot Mulroney). But easily the most notable among them is Diaz (Frank Grillo memorable in a small role in last years ""Warrior"") a former convict who initially opposes Ottways leadership. Carnahan lays the alpha dog stuff on heavily but theres real chemistry in the friction between Ottway and Diaz. In manly fireside chats they parse out existential ideas talking God in a wintery void faced with the uncompassionate brutality of nature. But ""The Grey"" is not ""Jaws"" and its certainly not ""Moby-Dick."" In the script by Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers adapted from Jeffers short story ""Ghost Walker"" the philosophical subtext is forced and obvious. At one point God is shouted out at in the sky. Visceral action has generally been Carnahans specialty ranging from the brainless ""Smokin Aces"" to the good gritty genre film ""Narc."" That talent is here too particularly in his sure handling of the violent plane crash. The wolves a combination of animatronics trained animals and CGI are also impressively real. With cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi Carnahan drains the color of the raw British Columbia landscapes standing in ably for Alaskan wilderness. But when the filmmakers try to let the outside world into the film - in conversation and flashback memories - all they can manage are cliche images that sap the movie of depth and keep it lost in the woods. ""The Grey"" which ambles toward an unconventional ending deserves credit for looking for gravity in genre tropes. But ultimately the film feels less like a genuine existential thriller than a movie aping the conventions of one. ""The Grey"" an Open Road Films release is rated R for violence disturbing content including bloody images and for pervasive language. Running time 117 minutes.

Prepare to be devastated. Films of hair-raising terror about people doing unspeakable things to each other are a dime a dozen usually with a built-in hole in their armor (people can always outsmart people). But movies about helpless humans versus uncontrollable nature are rare. A new one called The Grey about the survivors of an airplane crash in the frozen wastes of Alaska at the mercy of carnivorous wolves is the movie equivalent of a wet finger in a hot socket. This is the scariest wilderness survival movie about men stalked by animals since Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins landed on the menu of a bloodthirsty 10-ton grizzly in Lee Tamahoris 1997 thriller The Edge written by David Mamet. Liam Neeson stars as a decent man doing a tour of duty in an isolated oil refinery in the Alaskan wilds with a crew of ex-cons drifters and other rejects from society with whom he has nothing in common. Haunted by memories of better times a woman who left him and a small ray of hope that when he gets back to civilization hell play a better hand of poker he boards a plane home that crashes in an explosion of flames with only six survivors. Cut off from cell phone signals and every other form of communication the men are wounded suffering from frostbite understandably pessimistic pondering suicide and surrounded by howling wolves. As the men crawl away from the wreckage to search for a sign of life the sound of a helicopter overhead or the curl of smoke from a remote cabin chimney the wolves get closer. Ive read that wolves get a bad rap; theyre not aggressive and run from people. These wolves are different. Theyre ravenous territorial timber wolves--carnivorous bloodthirsty hungry for meat. While the dwindling handful of survivors search for a way to defend themselves scenes filled with nerve-frying suspense build steadily paralyzing you with anxiety. If possible wear gloves or your nails could get chewed to the quick. With a lack of oxygen to the brain in the altitude the men suffer from hallucinations and wander away from the fire into harms way. Without weapons and unable to run because theyre up to their knees in snow theyre tough alpha males but before they can even formalize their strategy they get picked off one by one torn limb from limb and devoured by killers with molars like fangs. Theres graphic gore but miraculously the writers also find humor in the mens natural coarseness. When they cook one wolf to stay alive the gruffest man says ""Im more of a cat person myself."" The word harrowing doesnt begin to cover it. You cant avoid wondering ""What would I do if this happened to me?"" One last rant at the sky one final plea for help one more challenge to the Almighty to prove His existence and escape remains impossible. All the more reason for men with nothing in common to turn their conflicted tensions into a sustained interdependence to stay alive. Alaska is played by the wilds of Canada. The men who support leader Liam Neeson are played by actors with more brawn than beauty including Dallas Roberts Joe Anderson Frank Grillo and Dermot Mulroney unrecognizable with long matted hair and a white beard as one of the more pragmatic survivors. Written and directed by Joe Carnahan (The A-Team) its basically a one-note narrative with nowhere to go except straight into the jaws of tragedy but the film manages to give each man enough room for character development to make you feel like youre living through this white-knuckle experience with them. Its one of the most captivating studies of shared peril. The Grey avoids smug cliches takes you to places you least expect and settles for no comfortable solutions while it explores the dark shadows of the male psyche and finds more emotional fragility there than you find in the usual phony macho myths from Hollywood. rreedobserver.com THE GREY Running Time 117 minutes Written by Joe Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers Directed by Joe Carnahan Starring Liam Neeson Dermot Mulroney and Frank Grillo 3/4 Comment Filed under Dermot Mulroney Frank Grillo Ian Mackenzie Jeffers Joe Carnahan Liam Neeson movie Movie Review Survival Wolves Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Radiohead Transformed Madison Square Garden Into A Moon Shaped Pool Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2012/01/the-grey-rex-reed-liam-neeson/,200,thegrey32,thegrey,observer

If you crash Liam Neeson and six disposable buddies in the frozen Alaskan wilderness there is the expectation--nay the requirement--that Neeson punch as many wolves as possible. Tape pocketknives and broken glass to your fists improvise other weapons from the plane wreckage just do whats necessary in the situation OK? But despite Neesons recent string of aggrieved-daddy action flicks (Taken Unknown etc.) this is not to be. Reuniting with his A-Team director Joe Carnahan Neeson is instead a melancholy Irish Catholic given to fits of poetry and religious doubt. He gently shepherds a dying passenger into the beyond. He provides sage advice to the motley survivors--worried by their knowledge of both Alive and Grizzly Man--as he attempts to lead them on a trek to safety. He writes to a mystery woman glimpsed in gauzy flashbacks (who provides the films only real jolt in making you think about Natasha Richardson). Along the way Neesons pack is revealed to be frail and fearful as The Greys dwindling survivors somberly contemplate the odds against them and as the film takes a mystical turn the absence of divine providence. Theres too much Jack London and as they systematically pick off the stragglers too many CGI wolves go unpunched.

With The Grey hes officially broken the slump the film was developed as a vehicle for Bradley Cooper but its hard to imagine his pretty face at the centre of this terse rock-solid survival thriller. This is a prime example of the right role for the right man at the right time - as Joe Carnahans camera lingers over those steel-blue eyes and that expressionless face as craggy and rugged as the Alaskan landscape its easy to believe that Neeson is in fact harder than a pack of wolves.Neeson is Ottway a hard-bitten hunter stranded at an oil outpost. When his plane back to civilisation crashes in the frozen wastes Ottway must lead a ragtag band of survivors to safety. But surviving blizzards and scaling ravines is one thing dealing with timber wolves quite another.After the excesses of The A-Team this is Carnahan stripping it back to basics - seven men one wilderness countless beasts. His directorial hand is firm the action sequences thrill the shocks are effective and if the characters are somewhat slight and the dialogue scenes overlong the film has a streamlined Hawksian narrative drive which carries it through the rough spots. Best of all though is Big Liam sharp surly and mean as hell hes as close as well get to a modern John Wayne - and who saw that coming?

No they do not attack like that for pleasure. No they do not persistently hunt people across huge stretches of land for no apparent reason other than to kill them without eating them. Alpha wolves do not test humans as the film made out wolves arent capable of thinking like that. And they certainly never send in their omega pack member to test to the strengths and weaknesses of their human prey.

The characters were cardboard most of the film was clearly shot on a set hence the lack of breath-fog in the supposedly sub-zero temperatures the wolves were poor CGI and behaved absolutely nothing like real wolves. Even I know that wolves dont behave the way they did in the film. Added to that characters making absurd decisions like lets head to the trees because well be safe there. Yeah okay not sure about that. And of course none of them think to rope themselves together for safety while trekking through a blizzard. Basics of survival there guys. Or my favourite If we head for running water we might find a cabin. Why? Why would you find a cabin in the middle of a frozen tundra? Who could possibly be living out there?

Audiences primed by trailers and TV spots to anticipate a straight-up man-vs.-nature action-thriller -- something like Liam Neeson in ""Tangles With Wolves"" -- may find ""The Grey"" to be at once more and less than what they expect. Helmer Joe Carnahan and co-scripter Ian Mackenzie Jeffers emphasize detailed characterization as much as lupine mayhem while depicting the life-or-death struggle of air-crash survivors pursued by humongous wolves in the Alaskan wilderness. Trouble is the pics dialogue-heavy stretches and ambiguous finale could leave ticketbuyers impatient for less chatter and more chomping. Word of mouth likely will be mixed though Neesons marquee allure should help. Neeson conveys an effective mix of authority intelligence and anxiety along with a generous dose of despondency in his compelling lead performance as John Ottway a sharpshooter employed at a remote Alaskan oil refinery to scare off (or when need be kill) wolves grizzlies or any other wild beasts that might threaten other employees. As ""The Grey"" begins Ottway appears perilously close to turning his rifle on himself sinking ever deeper into a suicidal depression evidently triggered by an irreconcilable separation from his wife (played by Anne Openshaw in teasing flashbacks). But when he and a handful of other refinery workers are stranded in the middle of a snow-blanketed nowhere as the only survivors of an airplane crash Ottway must yank himself out of his funk and take charge. Early on Ottway guesstimates theyve landed on the home turf of some very large and hungry rogue wolves so he encourages the other men to trek to safer ground all the while pursued by lupine predators. Diaz (Frank Grillo) the token ex-con badass in the group is the only fellow to seriously challenge Ottways leadership but even he evolves into a team player as wolves and wounds take their toll on the survivors. Much as he strove for the gritty feel of a 70s cop pic in his 2002 breakthrough feature ""Narc"" Carnahan here aims for the same balance of action and introspection found in such Me Decade survival dramas as ""Deliverance"" and ""Man in the Wilderness."" Echoes of the latter are especially apparent in the flashbacks that gradually reveal why Ottway is a loner. Carnahan also sporadically recalls ""Jaws"" during prolonged sections where the wolves -- portrayed variously by animatronic puppets CGI stand-ins and live trained animals -- register only as fleetingly glimpsed menaces when they are seen at all. The oncamera representations are largely convincing except during an inadvertently comical scene in which the glowing eyes of night-shrouded wolves bear an unfortunate resemblance to Christmas lights. Impressively lensed by Masanobu Takayanagi on aptly rugged terrain in British Columbia ""The Grey"" is thoroughly persuasive in its depiction of desperate men battling unforgiving elements. Indeed the pic may generate involuntary shivers from simpatico viewers as the well-cast players -- including Dermot Mulroney barely recognizable behind a beard and glasses and Dallas Roberts as the survivor seemingly least prepared for his adventure -- appear to endure the very worst nature can toss at them. Still even auds enthralled by the Jack Londonesque scenario may find themselves fidgeting now and then as the scribes (working from Jeffers short story) interrupt the action for extended conversational riffs. One can appreciate their ambition to add emotional heft to scenes in which characters discuss their family ties inner fears checkered pasts whatever. But truth be told the film is far more intriguing in those moments when the filmmakers slyly suggest a psychic connection between Ottway and the wolves and generate tension by implying some sort of karmic payback may be in order. Open Road Films would do well to somehow spread the word that auds should remain in their seats through the closing credits for a coda that indicates the aforementioned ambiguous finale may not be so ambiguous after all.

TWITTER Liam Neeson stars as the leader of a stranded pack of oil-rig roughnecks who are fighting for survival after their plane crashes in the wilderness. Late is better than never with The Grey a mans-man of a genre pic that will satisfy the action audience while reminding more discerning viewers what they saw in director Joe Carnahans decade-old breakthrough Narc. PHOTOS 20 Top Grossing Movies of 2011 However Liam Neesons admirers feel about the disappearance of Kinsey-grade fare from his filmography the film may be the best of his lowbrow outings casting him convincingly as a broken man getting one last chance to prove his mettle. Neeson plays a sharpshooter among brutes hired to kill wolves that threaten the oil-company employees -- ""men unfit for mankind"" he calls them in a nicely mood-setting voiceover -- populating a remote Alaskan outpost. On the verge of suicide himself Neeson must rally when a transport plane crashes leaving him stranded with a half-dozen other men somewhere in the wilderness. Scenes of post-crash triage deftly establish him as a man of deeper resources than his peers As he coaches a dying man through his final moments speaking with calm authority Neeson and the filmmakers ground the film -- promising that none of the deaths to come will be treated lightly however pulp-flavored the scripts perils may be. STORY Five Reasons Why Liam Neeson Is on Top of the Box Office Testosterone rages among the survivors particularly from a violence-prone ex-con (Frank Grillo) but the film makes that energy serve the story instead of behaving (a la Carnahans Smokin Aces) as if macho posturing were the whole point. Skirmishes over what to do intensify once its clear that a nasty pack of wolves are pursuing the men killing them territorially instead of for food and Neeson argues they must leave the plane to seek shelter above the treeline. Some viewers will find the movies slog through snow and pines longer than necessary but Carnahan and co-screenwriter Ian Mackenzie Jeffers make the most of the time wringing as much meaning as they can out of every test of courage and campfire bull session. Expected man-versus-wild man-versus-absent-God themes ring more true than usual here though not at the expense of the promised scares Plenty of chase scenes and gory encounters keep tension high. STORY Liam Neeson Survival Thriller The Grey Gets Release Date Co-stars Dermot Mulroney and Dallas Robert fill out supporting roles ably lending character-actor color to the ensemble without threatening the packs Alpha. Occasional grace notes (particularly with regard to sound editing) exhibit a subtlety unexpected from a filmmaker who just gave us The A-Team and even the tales final standoff while pandering to the more hotheaded members of the audience manages to squeeze off one last shot of adrenaline without insulting more skeptical viewers.
