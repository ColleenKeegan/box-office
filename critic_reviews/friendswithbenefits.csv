Why this seemingly serendipitous product placement? Thats easy Screen Gems which is releasing ""Friends"" is owned by the Sony Corp. Now on to the greater mystery of why anyone thought there was a crying need to make this movie. ""Friends"" is a rom-com that wants to have its cake and eat it too drawing attention to and making fun of the cliches of the genre even as it indulges in them. This is Irony 101. It opens with its romantic protagonists -- an art director named Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and an executive recruiter named Jamie (Mila Kunis) -- being dumped by their respective amours (Andy Samberg and Emma Stone in cameos). Clearly this love thing isnt working out for either of them. They meet when Dylan flies from his home in L.A. to New York City where Jamie is trying to place him as the design director at GQ magazine. He takes the job the two become friendly and decide that rather than going through the hassles of dating merely to have sex theyll scratch that basic itch with each other and save themselves the complications of emotional entanglements. Anyone who has ever seen a romantic comedy before knows where this one is going. Even the ahem best laid plans dont always work out. Its clear to everyone else in the movie and anyone watching even if not to themselves that Dylan and Jamie are falling for each other as they fall frequently and with enthusiasm on top of each other. In trying to be something other than just another rom-com ""Friends"" includes lots of rowdy sex talk and scenes. (Heres your chance to see Timberlakes backside in all its naked glory.) A few of these are funny but many are simply sophomoric including an extended toilet-joke scene. The major problem with ""Friends"" is that the tepid Timberlake and full-on sexy Kunis seem woefully mismatched. Shes a human barracuda feisty and full of energy and capable of emotional swings that could knock a truck sideways. Timberlake not so much. And thats really disappointing. He has often been hilarious in his frequent appearances on ""Saturday Night Live"" but in an extended film role especially one in which he is required to do more than comedy he appears diminished a wan pale presence. If Jamie and Dylan existed in real life shed dine on him for breakfast -- no sexual pun intended -- and be ravenous again by 10 a.m. ""Friends"" at least offers a notable supporting cast. Dependable veterans Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins turn up the former as Jamies kooky irresponsible mother and the latter as Dylans fading-into-Alzheimers father. Woody Harrelson barrels through awkward comic scenes as an enthusiastically gay colleague of Blakes. And Jason Segel and Rashida Jones pop up in a film within the film an especially awful romantic comedy that Jamie and Dylan watch repeatedly making fun of it and even as they are inexorably drawn to it. It is a mark of ""Friends"" inauthenticity that both of its 20something-year old lead characters though in well paid but not Wall Street wages jobs have fabulous roomy Manhattan apartments. Not only that but they magically zip from one end of town to the other in seconds thinking nothing of heading from midtowns Rockefeller Center to ""grab lunch"" all the way down in Soho.

Shes just been dumped by a drip with a peanut allergy and lets rip at a poster for a Katherine Heigl romcom (Shut up Katherine Heigl you stupid liar). The script is full of funny bang-on references like this. And the chemistry between Kunis and her co-star Justin Timberlake is electric.She is a headhunter who recruits his art director to a swanky job on a New York magazine. Both have sworn off relationships so make a pact to have a no-strings-attached sex-only arrangement (swearing an oath on a Bible app). It really is smarter than your average romcom - which is perhaps as much as you can hope for. But were never in any doubt as to the central will they or wont they? question. So while its probably grumpy to say it for all its hyper-switched-on nower-than-nowness its hard to see how its not just another Hollywood movie peddling true-love cliches.

After wandering around a deserted WESTFIELD shopping centre looking for the VUE Cinema with the intention of seeing TINKER TAILOR... we arrived too late to catch the beginning. Having got this far we had to see something so JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE it was. Still wincing over the thought of having to pay APS7.50 on a Sunday night in SHEPHERDS BUSH just to park my car we bought the tickets and coughed up another APS22 on a box of popcorn and a couple of beers I was amazed to discover the beers came in plastic bottles which bugged me to start with but at least we were able to take them into the cinema. What can I say about the film? Ive always been impressed with TIMBERLAKE but I wouldnt say this is his best moment. Having said that it was good to see him rapping away and dancing as if he was once in a BOY BAND. For the most part FRIENDS... was almost unbelievable but did have its moments and for this I will award 4 out of 10.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 13 2011_Matt_77_FeaturedI enjoyed this movie but (unlike the official reviewer) despite rather than because of the tacky cringeworthily self-conscious references to the art of film-making. When I am watching a movie I do not want the characters to be discussing the cliches that movies of that particular kind peddle - it breaks my suspension of disbelief it reminds me that Im in a cinema watching a movie and not in New York with Mila Kunis [which by the way would be very nice Mila if youre reading this] and essentially its a cheap trick which degrades the film in my eyes. Despite that this was an amusing endearing and at times smouldering rom-com. There isnt enough laying of the ground regarding the lead female characters emotional issues and it wasnt anywhere near as funny as some of the more puerile of recent offerings (The Inbetweeners the outstanding Hangover Paul or even the relatively middling Hangover II) but being able to watch Mila Kunis on screen for the best part of two hours makes up for that. One thing I will say is that the clips shown in trailers for this movie give away some of its funniest moments which is an irritating Hollywood habit which desperately needs to be stamped out. If youre planning on seeing this see it before you see anything else at the cinema so you dont catch the trailer for it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplySep 12 2011scrumpyjackFeaturedSass sassy and a bit more sassnesss on top.....then off to LA and we have a bit of decent back story with Richard whats his names Alzimer act.....then an ending befitting ARTHUR Oh not a toe curler by any means but the T.O. reviewer hints there may be real love and life being portrayed on screen.

Attraction blossoms as she shows him the cute underbelly of the city - lust without love throws them into bed a lot for oddly voyeuristic pleasure on the audiences part.

Its probably the best rom com of the year. The chemistry is evident between the leads and in places the film is both funny and particularly in the relationships between the leads and their parents is touching and at times genuinely full of pathos. Every film of this type ""friends falling in love despite swearing only to be friends"" has to be measured against When Harry Met Sally this film gets closer than most to the comedic heights of the Rob Reiner / Nora Ephron classic. There are a number of gentle tips to rom com history including the poster to ""It happened One Night"".

Photo David Giesbrecht/?2010 CTMG Inc. All Rights Reserved. ALL IMAGES ARE PROPERTY OF SONY PICTURES ENTERTAINMENT INC. FOR PROMOTIONAL USE ONLY. SALE DUPLICATION OR TRANSFER OF THIS MATERIAL IS STRICKLY PROHIBITED. Fast-paced and fabulously fake Friends With Benefits is the Red Bull of romantic comedies unapologetically delivering a hyperactive synthetic buzz. Justin Timberlake is always charming but never clueless. His studied studliness works here where he plays Dylan the goofily arrogant art director just as it did as the plastic mover-shaker Sean Parker in The Social Network and for that matter in his self-aware bits on SNL. His performance as aemotionally unavailablea ass man opposite aemotionally damageda wiseass Mila Kunis gamely lets her steal the show. Kunis plays Jamie a headhunter who recruits Dylan for a fancy job at GQ (a magazine for which Timberlake is the uracover model these days). Sheas crass sassy and so quick she never leaves time for the audience to stop and think too much. She teeters over a luggage conveyor belt in bare feet straddles Timberlake like sheas riding a mechanical bull and tosses off dick jokes with utter ease. The rest of the character actors in the cast prove that they can be hilarious caricature actors too. Patricia Clarkson plays Jamies cussing heavy-drinking free-love burnout mother with deadpan timing and a potty-mouth relish. Woody Harrelson is cartoonishly ridiculous as a horndog gay man who says things like ""I like cock -- Im stricallly dickally."" In the middle of all that madness the great Richard Jenkins somehow gets away with something like dignity playing the part of Dylans Alzheimers-suffering father. We all know films like Sleepless in Seattle or Love Actually or Bridget Joness Diary have little relation to real life. We find them compelling maybe because of that. Glucks smartest move is embracing that escapist fairy tale despite our qualms about the commercial genre -- an idea he nods to in the films two sweep-you-off-your-feet set pieces. Early on Kunis gives Timberlake a brightly lit touristy romp through Manhattan thats so romantic it makes Woody Allens rose-tinted vision of Manhattan look post-apocalyptic. Its capped with a ridiculous totally fun flash-mob performance in Times Square. Its a blast and Dylan triumphantly rips off the spontaneous performance for a GQ advertising campaign. The gambit resonates because thats exactly what director Will Gluck is doing himself and is after all what all rom-com directors do gleefully packaging romance. Gluck who co-wrote the script crossbreeds the giddy vulgarity of Knocked Up and the Manhattan glamour of The Devil Wears Prada into some kind of hardier commercial mutant. Hes a quick-witted inventive director with a naturals touch for contrivance. Most of all hes a Hollywood director who seems to love making fast light Hollywood movies. The better for all of us looking for something to do on a Saturday night in the air conditioning.

By David Denby Couple trouble Ryan Gosling Emma Stone Steve Carell and Julianne Moore.   Credit Illustration by ROBERT RISKO For the current Vanity Fair cover the young actress Emma Stone has been outfitted as an overgrown Lolita--bikini blond hair flaming-red lips. But in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" a genial messy comedy of marital discord and mismatched lovers Stone has auburn hair and a slightly downturned mouth; she looks like a woman and she has a direct clearheaded way about her that suggests the confidence of a potential star. Shes the strongest thing in the movie though she isnt part of the main line of the story which is also the least interesting. It seems that after twenty-five years the marriage of Cal (Steve Carell) and Emily (Julianne Moore) is breaking up. Emily has been sleeping with a dull guy in her office (Kevin Bacon in an unwritten part) and Cal hearing this news from Emily as she drives them through Los Angeles (the movies geography is a little vague) opens the car door and drops to the street like a misplaced bag of groceries. That Im afraid is the highlight of Cal and Emilys scenes together. Cal distraught airs his troubles in a sleek bar with amber glass walls and white stonework and a lot of lacquered players--a sort of can-I-buy-you-a-drink store for the always available. Jacob (Ryan Gosling) the king of the bar a mover in Simon Spurr Gossuin and designer stubble takes pity on the cuckold and teaches him how to pick up women. The kings own personal closer is ""Lets get out of here"" a line that unaccountably seems to work with every woman in the place except one Hannah (Stone) a law-school graduate who nimbly dismisses him. At least at first. She changes her mind though and arriving at his wraparound-glass bachelor pad demands that he remove his shirt which he does revealing a chest and abs so perfectly sculpted that shes revolted. She says ""Seriously? Its like youre Photoshopped"" Men in the audience may be relieved to hear that at least some women find the perfection of a gym body too close to narcissism to be a turn-on and Stone gives the line and many others a quick precise tart delivery. ""Crazy Stupid Love"" which was directed by the team of Glenn Ficarra and John Requa mixes a comedy-of-remarriage plot with a midsummer-nights serial follies. Cal loves his wife; Jacob is fascinated by Hannah; Cals thirteen-year-old son Robbie (Jonah Bobo) loves the teen-ager Jessica (Analeigh Tipton) who babysits for Robbies little sister; and Jessica loves of all people Cal. Written by Dan Fogelman the script has many parts in motion and a fair amount of it works delicately and well. Young Robbie boldly and persistently declares himself to Jessica (he doesnt know that hes not even in uniform much less out of his league) and Analeigh Tipton a tall slender stalk with huge pouty lips receives his declarations so sweetly that the scenes dont humiliate the actors or us. Robbies quest is the overstrained hope of adolescence. The subsidiary plotlines are touching and often funny but Cal and Emily provide the frame for all the goings on (there are a lot more). And who really cares if these nice ordinary people remain separated or get back together? They met when they were in high school and apart from reminiscing about that time they dont have much to say to each other. In the remarriage classics (""The Awful Truth"" ""The Philadelphia Story"" ""His Girl Friday"") the former partners have a way of talking and being with each other that they dont have--and couldnt possibly have--with anyone else. That sophisticated metaphor for sexual compatibility made for uniquely satisfying romantic comedy. But ""Crazy Stupid Love"" holds to the boring modern convention that good people are inarticulate and Cal and Emily mainly stumble around trying to fill the silence. Julianne Moore may be too earnest an actress for rigidly structured commercial comedy. She tries to find some hard truths in the role and she makes Emily angry vague and even a little dim. The character is parched and not very likable. Steve Carell has his ordinary-guys affect straight parted brown hair elongated almost-Cyrano nose slightly rabbity fear of everything. Even in masochistic roles (""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" ""Date Night"") in which he plays a guy one-upped sexually by other men he always conveys the sense that hes a rational man trying to keep his integrity no matter how bullied and miserable he feels. Its not clear to us that Cal who works at something or other in an office is good at anything in particular except moping around the back yard of the family house at night after he has moved out. Carell trying to keep up with Jacobs smarmy patter in the bar seems more comfortable acting with Ryan Gosling than with Moore. Gosling a serious fellow who usually plays alcoholics or drug addicts or murderers refuses to distance himself from Jacob by parodying the role. His Jacob is not an ironist. He really thinks hes Gods gift to women--apparently no one before Hannah has told him otherwise--and he wants to spread the glory slapping Cal to get his attention and then leading him through a makeover dressing him in Canali and Zegna and teaching him such startlingly original moves as not to talk about himself when he meets a woman in a bar. Applying his superlative new techniques Cal has his mishaps and his successes but the filmmakers believe in soul mates forever and that kind of thing and the audience may not want to think about the aftermath of the movie in which Cal and Emily discuss again and again that magical year they met in high school. ""Friends with Benefits"" is another of those movies in which a man and a woman--in this case Justin Timberlake as Dylan a Los Angeles Web designer who takes a magazine job in New York and Mila Kunis as Jamie the head-hunter who recruits him--spend hours debating Nietzsche Heidegger and Sartre before committing themselves to serious talk of omelettes. No wait. Thats in French movies. In ""Friends with Benefits"" Dylan and Jamie hop into bed and make very particular demands on each other but agree not to indulge in anything so dirty or squalid as emotion. The rule is you may do anything you like as long as you dont feel anything for the other person. James Thurber and E. B. White asked ""Is sex necessary?"" The new trend in romantic comedy is to ask ""Is love necessary?"" This movie is incomparably better than the pathetic Ashton Kutcher-Natalie Portman picture from earlier this year ""No Strings Attached"" in which the man and the woman also friends with benefits go at it in hospital supply closets and hybrid cars. At least Timberlake and Kunis stay in bed. And at least they talk--a great deal in fact and often very cleverly. ""Friends with Benefits"" is fast allusive urban glamorous--clearly the Zeitgeist winner of the summer (the couple take the no-emotion pledge by laying their hands on a tablet Bible app). The writers Keith Merryman David A. Newman and Will Gluck who also directed keep the characters racing ahead each trying to outsmart the other in and out of bed. This mini-genre of shag-buddy pictures is rather coy (theres only one way in American movies that these stories can end). And from the beginning its titillations are mildly delusional can you really have sex with the same person again and again without experiencing any emotion at all? I know it doesnt sound unpleasant but can you really? Despite the mild daring of the concept what keeps these plots going is that old screenwriting standby the fear of commitment. Both Dylan and Jamie are supposed to be emotionally damaged. That is unlike the rest of the world they come from families with problems. But they dont look the least bit damaged; they look and sound terrific and its their healthy sparring that makes the movie fun. Justin Timberlake as he demonstrated playing Sean Parker in ""The Social Network"" is a shrewd actor who knows how to swing his body through a scene. His glib talented Dylan though isnt overly impressed with himself. Timberlake is charming and hes a dynamo when he begins imitating old pop groups (except his own). Mila Kunis of the almond-shaped eyes and the dusky skin is all teasing mischief and easily hurt feelings. Woody Harrelson trying to play a gay sports editor at Dylans magazine twists himself into knots. His performance is ridiculous--half the time you dont know what hes saying--but you enjoy Harrelson enjoying himself. Patricia Clarkson has a comic turn as Jamies alcoholic sex-addicted mom and Richard Jenkins as Dylans dad does what he always does which is to make his part of the movie the best part of the movie. A smart man with Alzheimers painfully aware that hes losing it he lays down for Dylans sake some elementary life lessons. His advice as written is obvious but Jenkins speaks the words with such passionate conviction that he makes them seem like ultimate wisdom.

"Friends with Benefits | RichardRoeper.com BLOG On Camera RR YOUTUBE CHANNEL QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS Home    Movie Reviews    Friends with Benefits Print Page Email Page Search Friends with Benefits (2011; Rated ) A "" The best romantic comedy of the year."" -Richard Roeper MOVIE INFORMATION Friends with Benefits(2011; R)In theaters Friday 22 July 2011Genre ComedyCast Justin Timberlake Mila Kunis New Richard Roeper reviews weekdays at 500 PM ET only on REELZCHANNEL (5) Post a Comment  Mikesaid on Monday July 25 2011 41920 PMNice review Richard. I think you are spot on. It had all the rom com predictability as you suggested but Gluck played around with the genre in a fun way and the chemistry and performances with Mila and JT are great. TJsaid on Monday July 25 2011 13209 AMTotally agree Richard. By far the best romantic comedy of the year. Not that there is much competition. Of course like any rom com it has the predictable patterns but Gluck does a nice job of making fun of the genre and with crisp dialogue makes it work. Timberlake and Kunis not only have great chemistry but deliver solid performances as well. CC1023said on Sunday July 24 2011 94215 PMI LOVED it Cant wait to see it again. Predictable but so funny. scottsaid on Sunday July 24 2011 12421 AMDid we watch the same movie??? Are there two versions in circulation? The one I watched was tired and painfully cliched boring and flat unfunny. Zero charater development wih unrealistic relatioship groth coupled wih the obligatory bedroom scenes. We get it...sex is good. An alzheimers riddlwd father thrown in for no apparent reason than to give Timberlakes character an opportunity to mature? The fathers advice was right...life is to short to waste a minute....I wish I had the 90 I just spent in theater back Mariasaid on Friday July 22 2011 100846 PMHow can you call this the best romantic comedy of the year? Its labored at best in the final third of the movie as the screenwriters tries to wring some pathos out of revelations about the male leads life. The best laughs come not from the leads but Woody Harrelson--now he might have been a movie. But really FWB is so-so at best.

"Friends With Benefits reviewed Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have raunchy softcore sex in astronomically large New York apartments. Slate Sign In Sign Up Friends With Benefits reviewed Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have raunchy softcore sex in astronomically large New York apartments. Friends With Benefits reviewed Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis have raunchy softcore sex in astronomically large New York apartments. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 22 2011 415 PM Friends With Benefits Raunchy softcore sex in astronomically large New York apartments By Dana Stevens Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake in Friends With Benefits Friends With Benefits (Screen Gems) contains a movie-within-a-movie that I wish were real a mega-sappy romantic comedy in which Jason Segel and Rashida Jones fall in love against an obviously fake back-lot New York. (Grand Central Station is L.A.s train station in disguise; Central Park is lined with palm trees.) The two exchange meaningless phrases that are nonetheless recognizable as rom-com dialogue like Segels solemn parting words to his beloved ""I guess New York is all out of blueberries."" Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. If Friends with Benefits dared to be as smart and silly as that fake movie is it might really have something going on. This lead couple Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis bring a great asset to the table Theyre legitimately sexy in that they both seem like people one would want to have sex with and people who enjoy having sex. For all I know Timberlake and Kunis are uptight eunuchs in real life but theyre visibly at ease in their perfect young bodies Theyre fine they know theyre fine and theyre fine with being fine. Advertisement Friends with Benefits also does well in casting this pair as similarly driven young professionals. Dylan (Timberlake) is a star-blogger-turned-art-director at GQ (a career trajectory that doesnt make much sense but never mind). Jamie (Kunis) is the corporate headhunter who convinces him to move from L.A. to New York for the job. (A pre-credit sequence shows them both breaking up with their lame previous partners.) You can see what Dylan and Jamie two Type-A extroverts with troubled family histories and a shared taste for flash-mob dance routines see in each other. Its a shame that the movie directed by Will Gluck ( Easy A) wastes this pairs promising chemistry on such standard-issue rom-com material. My colleague Juliet Lapidos has written about the can-friends-have-sex-and-stay-friends rom-com subgenre; Id only add that unlike Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher in the identically themed No Strings Attached Kunis and Timberlake seem plausible as hard-boiled casual-hookup types. Both are given back stories to justify their resistance to long-term involvements Her mother (Patricia Clarkson) is an irresponsible promiscuous flake (but thanks to Clarkson kind of good company). His mother abandoned the family 10 years ago and his father (the ever-incredible Richard Jenkins) is now in the middle stages of Alzheimers. A couple of late scenes in which Jenkins confides in his son about his imminent decline break through the prevailing glib tone. Dylan and Jamie have established strict rules to keep the banter light as theyre having softcore but unusually raunchy sex in their astronomically large New York apartments. (Only Woody Allens characters could one-up these two in a real estate battle.) But one day as theyre getting down at Dylans childhood home on a trip to L.A. that lovin feelin comes creeping in ...  Maybe it ought to be enough that Jamie and Dylan have a believable spark between them and that hes funny rapping along to an old Kriss Kross record and that her green eyes and olive skin could win an Oscar for Best Complexion. But this movie cant seem to stop foundering into dumb-cliche territory. Woody Harrelson as a gay colleague of Dylans whos constantly referencing his own gayness is beyond embarrassing and its not poor Woodys fault; he has to crack a phallic joke about an elephant that no one should ever be compelled to make. Theres also a scene in which Jamie runs around barefoot on a moving baggage carousel without any of the onlookers objecting; this bit of business is presumably meant to make Jamie seem madcap but she just comes off as mentally unstable. The fact that there are two key scenes involving the joy every New Yorker apparently feels at the sight of a dancing flash mob pretty much puts the question to bed Friends With Benefits is a dumb by-the-numbers romantic comedy. Yet I kept finding small things to enjoy in it mainly because of the two hard-to-hate leads. Timberlakes comic charisma has been well established in multiple movies and SNL hosting spots; hes now ready for material more sophisticated than this or the recent abysmal Bad Teacher. And Kunis in every role shes played so far-- Forgetting Sarah Marshall Date Night Black Swan--has a captivating air of self-possession and a mischievous spark. She seems like someone whod be up for anything not just in bed but in life. Cant someone dream up a better romantic comedy for these two to star in? Is New York really all out of blueberries?Correction July 26 2011 The article originally and incorrectly stated that the childhood home where the lovin feelin came creeping in belonged to Jamie. In fact it belonged to Dylan.(Return to corrected sentence.) Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

At its core its just a regular ol romantic comedy except that its about a guy and girl who are cynical about love because theyve been raised on a steady diet of dumb romantic comedies. Since the characters in Friends with Benefits openly ridicule the rom-com genre (as well they should) the burden is on Friends with Benefits to avoid being the kind of movie those characters would make fun of. And it succeeds thanks to comedic chemistry between the two leads and nimble direction by Will Gluck who also did enough rewrites on Keith Merryman and David A. Newmans screenplay to get co-credit. (Im telling you Gluck is one to watch. His Fired Up and Easy A were both much smarter and funnier than they ought to have been and the short-lived sitcom he created The Loop was borderline genius.) Mila Kunis plays Jamie a corporate headhunter described by her ex-boyfriend as ""emotionally damaged."" Justin Timberlake is Dylan described by his ex-girlfriend as ""emotionally unavailable."" Miss Damaged and Mr. Unavailable meet when Jamie recruits Dylan for a top position at GQ Magazine and this professional interaction -- and the fact that Dylan doesnt know anyone else in New York -- leads to an easy friendship. When they do finally sleep together its only after the movie has established a friendship between them that feels remarkably authentic. Their jokey rapport resembles that of the 30-year-olds in your own life with the fresh aroma of natural unscripted camaraderie. Do you have any Generation-Y-age friends who are funny? Then they probably converse the way Dylan and Jamie do. This is crucial to the film which would be a disaster otherwise. We believe Dylan and Jamie are friends and we believe that neither wants a romantic relationship with the other (or with anyone) and we believe that they believe they can really have casual sex without strings becoming attached. What sounded like a cheap and shallow premise on paper is actually a fleshed-out and convincing story. Timberlake and Kunis are marvelous together both absurdly good-looking and charming yet somehow also down-to-earth and accessible. The movie not only makes you feel like youre hanging out with a couple of fun friends for two hours it also makes you feel like you could actually be friends with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis which of course you cannot. They are aided immeasurably by three supporting performances. Patricia Clarkson is a whirlwind of comedy as Jamies flaky and free-spirited sexpot mother. Woody Harrelson is Dylans enthusiastically lascivious gay co-worker who defies most of the ""gay best friend"" rom-com stereotypes. And the indispensable Richard Jenkins manages to bring real heart to a treacherous role Dylans father his role model now suffering from Alzheimers. Certain things are required in a movie like this even one thats savvy enough to know that its a movie like this. That means Dylan and Jamies friendship must be imperiled by their intimacy that they must have a fight that one must rush to reconcile with the other in a public place. You cant avoid every cliche and maybe you dont need to. Most romantic comedies are based on the premise of keeping two people who are obviously in love from realizing theyre in love. In this case we can buy Dylan and Jamies reluctance to face facts and we get a lot of laughs in the process of seeing them figure it out.

(GlLEN WILSON/SCREEN GEMS) Mila Kunis plays a prank on Justin Timberlake in a scene from Friends With Benefits.(GlLEN WILSON/SCREEN GEMS) Film review Friends with Benefits Rom-com done (mostly) right Add to ... ANITA LI The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 22 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Boy meets girl. Boy enters casual sexual friendship with girl. Complications arise. Conflict ensues. Boy falls in love with girl Its a tired formula moviegoers know well (most recently from Ivan Reitmans No Strings Attached) but in the case of Friends With Benefits it works. Directed by Will Gluck ( Easy A) the film is a witty rom-com for the smart-phone generation. Gen-Yers may enjoy watching escapist tripe as much as anyone but they are savvy consumers who dont buy into bull. Friends With Benefits stands out from similar movies for its self-awareness and attempt at authenticity. By poking fun at its genre and the cliches that come with the rom-com territory (in one scene the protagonists watch and ridicule a sappy movie-within-a-movie starring Jason Segel and Rashida Jones in cameos) the films creators seem to say ""We know the drill you know the drill but that wont stop us from enjoying the process."" Movies Friends with Benefits The official trailer Thanks to the power of the Internet a Marines YouTube request to go on a date with Mila Kunis got through to the actress who said yes. AP Celebrity Video Actress says yes to Marines YouTube date request Friends With Benefits follows Jamie (Mila Kunis) a New York headhunter who recruits L.A.-based Dylan (Justin Timberlake) to the Big Apple for a job as art director of the mens magazine GQ. After striking up a whirlwind friendship the two decide to add casual sex to the mix predictably complicating their feelings toward each other. Onscreen sparks fly between Timberlake and Kunis (whose comfortable performance as a sassy independent woman is characteristic of her roles in That 70s Show and Black Swan). Unlike the mismatched Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher in No Strings Attached their chemistry and likeability - not to mention eye-candy status - is what makes this movie click. In his first leading role Timberlake plays it safe as the nice guy turning in a decent by-the-books performance that could have been filled by most other Hollywood hunks. Ironically despite Timberlakes desire to distance himself from his boy-band past the singer-actor gets the most laughs when his character serenades Jamie with Semisonics Closing Time while doing the dirty. Patricia Clarksons scene-stealing turn as Jamies freewheeling mother Lorna (a role she plays with equal effect in Easy A) leads a strong supporting cast that includes Woody Harrelson as GQs aggressively gay sports editor. Fun cameos by Emma Stone ( The Help) and Andy Samberg (of Saturday Night Live fame) as Dylan and Jamies ex-lovers and Olympic snowboarder Shaun White as an unstable version of himself only add to the onscreen dynamics. But its the films dialogue that pushes Friends With Benefits beyond the rom-com stereotype. Although not laugh-out-loud funny the witty banter between Jamie and Dylan (at its peak during their hilariously raunchy sex scenes) is pretty realistic - noteworthy for a genre that usually sticks to hackneyed phrases. Their quick back-and-forth matches the movies fast pace heightened by the rampant use of iPads YouTube and apps throughout. Although screenwriters Gluck Keith Merryman and David Newman never reach the level of funny achieved in Easy A Glucks previous directorial effort they manage to similarly inject humorous pop cultural references into the dialogue - a running joke about Dylans questionable Harry Potter lightning-bolt tattoo is repeated to great comic effect. Ultimately though Friends With Benefits has a formula that it follows - and cliche is inescapable In one scene a spurned Jamie says to Dylan ""I actually thought you were different ... With friends like you who needs friends?"" The film hits a slow spot near the end with a subplot involving Dylans father Mr. Harper (Richard Jenkins) who is suffering from Alzheimers. While their strained relationship helps develop Dylans character the scene in which Harper gives his son a pep talk on pursuing the woman of his dreams feels clunky and anticlimactic. Only after this stumbling block does the movie build to a satisfying conclusion sweet but not saccharine. Over all Friends With Benefits is your standard romantic-comedy fare - but with benefits.

Comments click to enlarge Friends With Benefits Video Rated R  104 minutes  2011 Justin Timberlake plays an LA web designer whos recruited by New York headhunter Mila Kunis to work for GQ in this sexy rapid-fire romantic comedy which simultaneously spoofs and adheres to the genre. Though a natural fit as buddies theyre both so commitment-phobic that they couple only after agreeing that the sex will be strictly physical. Of course their snappy pillow talk leads to something deeper once their feelings emerge from the distracting clutter of iPads cell phones and chick flicks (Jason Segel parodies himself in the movie-within-the-movie). The jokes dont all work and the topical references can be irritably hipper-than-thou but at least director and cowriter Will Gluck (Easy A) aims high this is patterned on the Tracy and Hepburn comedies albeit with a lot more skin.

By Peter Rainer July 22 2011 Save for later Saved In this publicity image released by Sony Screen Gems Justin Timberlake portrays Dylan and Mila Kunis portrays Jamie in a scene from Friends with Benefits. Sony Screen Gems/Glen Wilson/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Can men and women be just friends have sex together and still keep it friendly? Variations on this earth-shattering theme have been wrought by movies as wildly disparate as ""Last Tango in Paris"" and ""No Strings Attached."" Now we have the latest entry ""Friends With Benefits"" starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis as the designated beneficiaries. The answer to this question at least in the movie world is invariably a resounding ""no."" Or maybe ""duh"" Since its a foregone conclusion that the friends-only scenario is irreversibly complicated by sex the only suspense in ""Friends With Benefits"" lies in observing how the characters finally realize something we knew all along. They take an awfully long time to realize it. Timberlakes Dylan is a hotshot Los Angeles media art director who is lured to a New York job as art director for GQ magazine by Kuniss Jamie a vivacious corporate headhunter. Even though Dylan is apparently savvy and worldly enough to have landed the job he is inexplicably portrayed as something of a bumpkin from the sticks - as if L.A. was a cow town. He needs Jamie to show him the big-city ropes and soon they agree to a friendship with whoopee on the side. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? With messed-up relationships in both of their pasts Dylan and Jamie are primed for the real deal and they find it in each other - even though neither will admit it. Their cluelessness is supposed to be cute but instead they come across as rather stunted. Apparently Dylan has ""commitment issues"" while Jamie who was raised by her superannuated hippie mother (Patricia Clarkson) is a closet flower child looking to put down roots. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Its tired stuff and director Will Gluck and his coscreenwriters Keith Merryman and David Newman probably realize it too. Thats why they periodically work in sequences of a film-within-a-film featuring Jason Segel and Rashida Jones that parodies every studio rom-com cliche. Since ""Friends With Benefits"" is replete with many of the same cliches this ploy - diversionary tactic? - is a mite disingenuous. Timberlake and Kunis try hard to keep this charm machine purring and they do indeed have traces of chemistry which is more than you can say for most romantic couples in the movies these days. (Exhibit A Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts in the already forgotten ""Larry Crowne."") But their chemistry is at the service of a science project weve all seen before.

This is a given that director Will Glucks Friends with Benefits uses to its advantage. It revels in poking fun at the formula that of course it wont be able to avoid pretty people fall in love trouble ensues and all is resolved in a way that never happens to you. The latest and most charming of a string of no-strings-attached spins on the rom-com Friends with Benefits even features a pretend movie within the movie starring (in uncredited cameos) a fat Jason Segel and a deliberately insipid Rashida Jones exemplifying exactly the kind of saccharine love story that Friends with Benefits is trying to be better than yet still provides the inspiration for the climax. Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is the art director for a popular website based in Los Angeles where his father (Richard Jenkins) and sister (Jenna Elfman) live. He is lured to Manhattan by a headhunter Jamie (Mila Kunis) who has been hired to recruit an art director for Gentlemans Quarterly. (And you thought they just consulted the rest of the media elite when making such decisions.) Both of them are freshly dumped -- Dylan by a girlfriend (Emma Stone the star of Glucks Easy A) who accuses him of being emotionally unavailable Jamie by a dude (Andy Samberg Timberlakes partner from the SNL short ""Dick in a Box"") who says shes emotionally damaged. While Dylan and Jamie have instant sparks they opt not to get involved. Instead they make a weird pact to just service each other without letting romance intervene as did Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman in Januarys No Strings Attached. They arrive at this decision after watching the fake Segel-Jones movie together. Jamie can mouth the lines to this cherished love story but wonders why no one ever makes a movie about what happens after the first kiss. ""They do"" retorts Dylan. ""Its called porn."" Considering how much time Timberlake and Kunis spend hovering on top of and between each others lovely limbs theres definitely something of the soft porn appeal to Friends with Benefits. They have raunchy frank conversations about sex and though there are more carefully tangled sheets in this movie than in any normal bedroom the imperfect but steadily improving sex they have is about as close to realistic as a Hollywood romantic comedy ever gets. Hollywood could be the third billed star of Friends with Benefits even with Woody Harrelson hamming it up as GQs kinda-gross horny gay sports editor. Its present as both place (on a visit to Los Angeles Dylan and Jamie climb the Hollywood sign together) and concept (it hangs over these young people shaping not only their closely held romantic fantasies but also their cynicism their wont-get-fooled-again attitudes). Old movies like On the Waterfront and Bob amp; Carol amp; Ted amp; Alice play on screens in the background. There are references to Nora Ephron Harry Potter Seinfeld and Will amp; Grace as well as some swipes at the novels of Nicholas Sparks Katherine Heigls movie career and George Clooneys commitment issues. Jamie and Dylan inhabit an intensely pop-culture-centric tech-savvy world; when they make their no-love lovemaking pact they do it on her singing Bible app. Timberlake bursts into apt parodies of 90s songs on multiple occasions reminding you that before he was an actor he was a song and dance man. All this self-referential intensely of-the-moment business nearly overpowers the movies emotional side. My hunch is that when Gluck rewatches this movie in 10 years hell ask himself Why did I clutter things up by casting that red-haired snowboarding kid Shaun White? Playing himself White takes you out of the mood of the love story. So does the cinematography. Kunis is lit as if it were always magic hour Timberlake as if it were a dewy morning even when theyre standing right next to each other. And the camera is so up in their faces you start to feel an aestheticians urge to go to work. The screenplay with credits shared by Gluck Keith Merryman and David A. Newman is predictable plotwise. But it is elevated by energetic dialogue the sexual chemistry between the leads and the fact that the miscommunication that keeps bliss at bay -- theres always one in a rom-com and usually it is annoyingly unbelievable -- is plausible. The lithe Kunis all tough girl talk and tawny eyes is 10 times more interesting than a Heigl or a Hudson. Timberlake looks a little lost when it comes to the movies dramatic contrivance of Dylans dads struggle with Alzheimers but he is an absolutely adroit comedian. Theres a scene in which Jamie reassures Dylan that shell be fine spending the Fourth of July alone. Impatiently he tells her he knows that shell be physically fine ""Youre not a baby in a hot car."" It takes someone either really fast on his feet or super cute to get away with a joke that dark and tasteless. In Timberlakes case its both.

"Friends With Benefits review You wont have a very good time at the movies this weekend |       NJ.com comments Friends With Benefits review You wont have a very good time at the movies this weekend Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on July 22 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments David GiesbrechtJustin Timberlake and Mila Kunis in ""Friends With Benefits"" which is in the less-than-grand tradition of films such as ""No Strings Attached"" and ""Love and Other Drugs."" Remember ""When Harry Met Sally"" a film that asked whether a man and a woman could be friends without falling into bed? Tame stuff for a tamer age. Now the big movie premise is whether a man and a woman can have sex without falling in love. Last year ""Love and Other Drugs"" played it for both satire and tragedy giving the boy a hot-shot big pharma job and the girl an incurable disease. This year ""No Strings Attached"" played it for laughs and mild gender-bending making the male the sensitive one and the female the workaholic. Now ""Friends With Benefits"" plays it -- well just badly. The movie starts with a torrent of blue dialogue as if to announce upfront (as ""No Strings Attached"" did) that hey this is not going to be your standard sappy rom-com. In fact it even goes out of its way to make fun of the genre occasionally showing the characters watching a bad made-up romance on TV with Jason Segel and Rashida Jones. But the problem is ""Friends With Benefits"" is a standard sappy rom-com complete with truth-talking parents and an outrageous gay friend. Its as conventional as any other movie out there. Movie Review Friends With Benefits (R) Screen Gems (104 min.) Directed by Will Gluck. With Justin Timberlake Mila Kunis. Now playing in New Jersey Rating note The film contains sexual situations nudity and alcohol abuse. Stephen Whittys Review ONE AND A HALF STARS Its just dirtier. In fact a lot of the dialogue -- particularly the lines given to the actresses -- will leave you thinking I-cant believe-she-just-said-that. But not because its outrageous. Just because its gross and kind of embarrassing. For everyone. The very thin plot has executive recruiter Mila Kunis getting webpage genius Justin Timberlake a Manhattan magazine job. Hes new to the city and the two end up becoming friends. Then they decide they need to add some ""benefits."" And no Im not talking about dental. Both performers obediently show their bottoms but the bedroom scenes dont have the honesty that the ones in ""Love and Other Drugs"" did. And even though there are plenty of things that sound like jokes there arent nearly as many laughs as in ""No Strings Attached."" Instead the film progresses fitfully with a series of carefully choreographed sex scenes (interspersed with family drama) several inexplicable cameos by extreme athlete Shaun White and a really dreadful sense of Manhattan geography. I know the majority of Americans will not notice or care but GQ magazine does not have its own building in Rockefeller Center -- and even if it did Soho would not be practically next door. (Whats particularly galling is that the movie congratulates itself on getting New York right.) But then the whole picture is a little lost. Kunis is lively at least and has a nice mocking attitude (and the movie gets a few good lines in about her ""exotic"" looks -- exotic in Hollywood means any actress who isnt a blonde). Timberlake though is out of his depth. He was great fun in ""The Social Network"" in a supporting role; he could just parachute in take over a scene and then walk away. But he has to carry a whole movie here and hes too lightweight to lift it. Lewd hurried and forgettable the whole movies like a one-night stand boiled down to 100 minutes -- complete with a walk-of-shame out to the parking lot afterward.

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Friday July 22 2011 400 AM Title Friends With Benefits Romantic comedy about friends who want sex without commitment. With Justin Timberlake Mila Kunis. Director Will Gluck. (149) R language nudity sexuality. At area theaters.Like a guy who wants to plan an outrageous date but ends up falling back on dinner and a movie ""Friends With Benefits"" isnt nearly as original as it pretends to be. But its cute and funny and sweet which--as any woman can attest--puts it way ahead of most Friday night options.You certainly couldnt ask for better company than Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis both charming as BFFs Dylan (him) and Jamie (her). Hes an LA blogger; shes the NYC headhunter who convinces him to move East as GQs new art director.Both are reeling from a series of lousy relationships and agree to give the titular pact a try. If you saw Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher go through the same its-only-sex charade in Januarys ""No Strings Attached"" you know exactly how things turn out.This movie though has a sassy edge that almost hides its old-fashioned heart. And the well-chosen cast works hard to prove were not stuck with a disposable rom-com.Theres strong support from Richard Jenkins as Dylans ailing dad and Patricia Clarkson as Jamies flaky mom. But the leads get most of the credit. They banter well look great and feel (relatively) real. While Timberlake has an easier time with the comedy Kunis doesnt miss a single beat serious or silly.Director Will Gluck who co-wrote the clever screenplay is most successful when riffing on pop culture. He particularly loves mocking romantic comedy formulas which is funny until we notice his own reluctance to take risks. Given the witty rebellion of his last film the bracingly fresh teen comedy ""Easy A"" that lack of nerve is undeniably disappointing. Aside from the salty dialogue and some deft setups whats most startling here is how few surprises there actually are.  But while this story turns out to be unabashedly conventional its just as important to note what ""FWB"" is not. Its not neurotic or lazy or disdainful of either its heroes or audience. And sometimes you really do feel like dinner and a movie. Come date night you could do a lot worse.Magic Moment Timberlake rocks Kris Krosss ""Jump"" with impressive and amusing commitment.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Friends With Benefits"" is a savvy satirical date movie that holds the conventions of romantic comedy up to self-aware spoofing while still delivering the goods. Justin Timberlake steps into his first leading role with a winning air of ironic self-consciousness. As the woman who agrees to be his no-strings-attached bed buddy Mila Kunis has a flash fire and humor that is scarce among young actresses. They are enormously attractive actors with a strong current of romantic electricity running between them and they make the film a swell night out especially for couples who love to laugh. The story examines the hypothesis often postulated but rarely tested that men and women can have a healthy sexual relationship without all the sticky emotional glue that usually accompanies grownup sleepovers. Timberlake the new art director for GQ magazine and Kunis the corporate headhunter who got him the dream job put it to the test. They like each other immediately but each comes with a considerable amount of emotional baggage. They agree that sex is a pleasant stress-reliever like cracking your neck or a game of tennis. After a few jolly raunchy booty calls guess what The theory begins to disintegrate. A sweet tentative feeling grows between them etc. complications ensue etc. Questions of commitment arise only to be wrestled to the ground with brusque jokes. But they recur chasing our heroes like mutant zombies until the inevitably happy finale. The gravitational pull of the time-tested story line is strong but the movie is fueled with enough creativity to achieve liftoff. The filmmakers respect the movie tradition theyre working in. They may mock it but they never condescend to it. FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for sexual content and language. RottenTomatoes.com read reviews Showtimes view listings A gallery of well-known actors turn up in tiny smart cameos that ought to remain surprises. Patricia Clarkson plays Kunis mother and Richard Jenkins portrays Timberlakes dad bringing idiosyncratic human interest to what could have been throwaway roles. Movies such as this live or die by their stars and here the casting is very fortunate. Timberlake isnt a dreamboat leading man in the old Rock Hudson mold of stolid masculinity. Hes more a Tony Randall type wry and bantamweight dancing nimbly on the tightrope between comedy and romance. He sings occasionally but he doesnt belt it out crooning in an ordinary happy voice that would hold its own at a Wednesday night karaoke competition. Kunis who has dark beckoning eyes and a smoky voice made for caressing punch lines plays her role at cruising speed. Other than a couple of passages where she is called on to sulk she confidently holds the screen and involves us in her character. The actors make intelligent jokes about how movies have ruined romance and they rip to shreds a dire-looking Jason Segal date movie that embodies every cloying cliche of the type. They also make unflattering jokes about T-Mobile HBO Barnes amp; Noble and Nicholas Sparks that -- for once -- I dont think represent product placement. These are smart people saying smart things which is what comedy should be. From the opening which uses a switcheroo from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" to pull the rug from under our expectations to the zippy little kicker after the end credits theres scarcely a scene that lacks freshness and charm.

Starring Justin Timberlake Mila Kunis Woody Harrelson Director Will Gluck Running time 144 Release Opened Jul 22 2011  Editorial Review Platonic relations with a bit of spiceBy Ann HornadayFriday Jul 22 2011Watch your back Natalie. Milas nipping at your heels like a sexy smoky-voiced Corgi. First Mila Kunis stole every scene she shared with Natalie Portman in last years bravura ballet drama ""Black Swan."" Now Kunis steals Portmans thunder in ""Friends With Benefits"" the thematic and infinitely superior double of ""No Strings Attached"" in which Portman co-starred with Ashton Kutcher. While Portman and Kutcher generated zero heat in that tale of sex-buddies who turn out to be soul mates Kunis and Justin Timberlake fairly set the screen on fire as cynics who agree to use each other for physical gratification but otherwise remain steadfastly un-love-struck. Of course director and co-writer Will Gluck (""Easy A"") knows his audience - and knows rom-com connoisseurs know better than to buy the friends-only bushwah. But he and co-writers Keith Merryman David A. Newman and Harley Peyton adroitly address those assumptions head-on by making Kuniss character a hard-driving media headhunter named Jamie a savvy consumer of romantic comedy cliches who is nonetheless powerless to resist their happily-ever-after promises. After Jamie persuades Timberlakes Dylan to move to New York to become art director at GQ the two become best buds deciding one drunken evening to step up their game. The secret to the success of ""Friends With Benefits"" is that Kunis and Timberlake not only capture the joshing ease of platonic friendship but the far more complicated emotions that inevitably develop as the sex gets friskier. Kunis possesses particular zing as a tart unsentimental romantic heroine who secretly longs for someone to topple her defenses. But if Kunis gets the showier role in ""Friends With Benefits"" Timberlake proves a quietly charming stalking horse finally claiming and fully owning the spotlight with a hilarious homage to the 1990s rap duo Kriss Kross. For all the funny lines Manhattan atmosphere and believable chemistry in ""Friends With Benefits"" Gluck almost single-handedly destroys it with cheap-looking cinematography and hyper-active editing that never allows the two hugely attractive leads to exist in the same frame. Thats a shame because given the space and time to play off each other Kunis and Timberlake could have recalled Hepburn and Tracy at their peppery best. (He films not one but two flash-mob scenes with jittery imprecision that renders them as incoherent as they are dated and repetitive.) Still Gluck has the good sense to cast his supporting players with taste and good care Patricia Clarkson brings her usual feathery subtlety to Jamies hippie-dippy mom and Jason Segel and Rashida Jones gamely star in a movie-within-a-movie that trots out every rom-com cliche in the book. If ""Friends With Benefits"" ultimately succumbs to the very sins it so cleverly deconstructs it still commits those infractions with a welcome degree of wit and when it slows down enough spirited flair. Contains sexual content and profanity.

Chemistry is the usually misfiring engine that drives ro mantic comedies so its a pleasure to re port that Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are practically combustible together in ""Friends With Benefits."" It far outclasses Hollywoods other inquiry into this phenomenon this year the crass and mercifully forgotten ""No Strings Attached."" Besides having far more compatible leads than the nonstarter combo of Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman Will Glucks bright screwball farce has witty dialogue that sparkles at least by debased 21st-century standards. It also endearingly manages the postmodern trick of mocking all the cliches of the genre -- meet-cutes dysfunctional relatives the gay best friend celebrity cameos real estate porn a tourists-eye view of cities and reunions in public places -- at the same time it offers them up for our approval. PHOTOS FRIENDS WITH BENEFITS FILMING IN NEW YORK Timberlake who may be the most self-effacingly ironic actor working in films today plays a California Web site designer who is recruited for a high-ranking job at GQ magazine (one of countless products and films plugged herein with a wink) by Kunis corporate headhunter. Initially greeting him from an airport luggage conveyor belt Kunis quickly determines that because they are both commitment-phobic (for the usual cliche reasons) they would make perfect sex buddies. They take a ""no relationship"" vow on an iPad Bible app. Their couplings -- involving strategic partial nudity in vast Manhattan apartments with killer views their characters could never afford in real life -- have genuine heat and their sometimes racy exchanges have some zing. He ""Im from LA. I like my open spaces."" She ""What are you? A gazelle? You LA folk are so . . . cute."" The dysfunctional relatives are played by pros Patricia Clarkson (her divorced sexually inappropriate hippie mom) and Richard Jenkins (his divorced dad who has Alzheimers). Another Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson plays a sports editor and Timberlakes gay wingman who is never too busy to ferry Justin across the Hudson in his motorboat. Olympic snowboarder Shaun White contributes the requisite self-mocking celebrity cameo as himself. While the leads make fun of the fake LA-for-Manhattan tourist locales of a movie-within-the-movie ""Friends With Benefits"" of course wallows in the real thing. Among other things theres a musical number set in Times Square and an amusing episode involving the Hollywood sign when they spend a weekend in Los Angeles. The climax of the fake movie with Jason Segel (Rashida Jones Emma Stone and Andy Samberg also turn up briefly) amusingly prefigures the real one which offers another production number. Timberlake who sings a few bars there and elsewhere is an appealing presence. Still his performance in ""The Social Network"" suggests hes more interesting as seducer than seduced (as he also is in ""Bad Teacher"" with Cameron Diaz with whom he has absolutely no chemistry). Briskly directed by Gluck -- whose superior ""Easy A"" was one of last years best sleepers -- ""Friends With Benefits"" announces that Kunis (who came close to stealing ""Black Swan"" in a supporting role) is a genuine movie star to watch. Then again its hard not to love someone who looks at a poster for the abysmal rom-com ""The Awful Truth"" and exclaims ""Shut up Katherine Heigl you stupid liar"" lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Chris Brown to star in romantic comedy Read Next Chris Brown to star in romantic comedy Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 17854 How Hillary blew her big moment 10583 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 7306 NYC tourist duped into buying 1M worth of fake jewelry Now On Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

"Friends has benefits but tone isnt one of them - USATODAY.com Skip to Main Content USA TODAY Subscribe Mobile Home News Travel Money Sports Life Your Life Tech Weather Friends has benefits but tone isnt one of them By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Updated Comments Reprints amp; Permissions Like true love or even the pace of casual hookups Friends With Benefits does not follow a smooth course. By David Giesbrecht Screen Gems (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) agree to be bed partners and nothing more. EnlargeClose By David Giesbrecht Screen Gems (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) agree to be bed partners and nothing more. But the fault does not lie with its likable stars. Its an uneven comedy that takes full advantage of the charm and palpable chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Timberlake is Dylan an L.A.-based art director recruited by New York headhunter Jamie played by Kunis. Shortly after she persuades him to take a job at GQ they realize they also can fill the position of sex buddies during a period in which each of them has sworn off relationships. Beneath her feisty exterior Jamie is a wounded romantic. Belying his suave demeanor Dylan is insecure and fearful. We buy their lusty appetites and teasing banter. They discover as did Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher in the much less engaging No Strings Attached that getting physical without romantic bonds does not mean emotions are checked at the bedroom door. (Unless youre Jon Hamm and Kristen Wiig who hilariously pulled off the heartlessly casual booty call in Bridesmaids.) Friends With Benefits is better than most rom-coms as it satirizes and repurposes the genre. But its brisk pace stumbles while establishing its rhythm switching from raunchy to silly to heartfelt almost as if in sections. It feels as if the film is not comfortable in its own skin particularly in the verbally raunchy scenes. Director Will Gluck tries to strike a similarly breezy tone as he did in last years Easy A. But Friends doesnt come off as deftly. Of course we know theyre meant for each other as do they -- despite all their talk of casual sexual romps. About the film Friends With Benefits   1/2 out of four Stars Mila Kunis Justin Timberlake Patricia Clarkson Richard Jenkins Jenna Elfman Director Will Gluck Distributor Sony Pictures Rating R for strong profanity and sexual content brief rear nudity Running time 1 hour 44 minutes Opens Friday nationwide Glucks forte is assembling a top-notch ensemble. Standouts include Woody Harrelson as Dylans aggressively gay co-worker Patricia Clarkson as Jamies free-spirited mom and Jenna Elfman as Dylans world-weary big sis. But the way the film is shot doesnt always suit the content. Soft-focus lighting seems oddly paired with explicit sex scenes. When its good Friends With Benefits is quite good -- especially as it skewers rom-com cliches. And Timberlake and Kunis definitely bring sexy back to a tired formula. If only the movie had been worthy of their expertly playful pairing. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Dylan packs and relocates from Los Angeles to New York for the gig and Jamie is his only friend there. Both have been recently dumped and consider themselves damaged goods both have given up on the idealized romances put forth by countless Hollywood rom-coms and both want something casual with no strings attached for the time being.Hence the title as Dylan and Jamie agree to up their friendship by becoming casual sex partners while waiting for real romance. Of course just as in real life complications ensue with jealousy emotional needs and unexpected (except by the audience) feelings upending whats supposed to be a simple arrangement allowing two ridiculously beautiful and privileged people to find true love yadda yadda yadda.Friends With Benefits is gamely dedicated to the idea of deflating the unrealistic fairy-tale nature of Hollywood romantic comedies as exemplified by its sappy film-within-a-film starring Jason Segel and Rashida Jones. It pokes fun at all the contrived cuteness the idealistic lifestyles portrayed (sorry folks but you really cant live alone in a spacious Manhattan loft while working as a barista and aspiring dancer) and the carriage-ride-into-the-sunset happy endings. Unfortunately Friends With Benefits resorts to those exact same conventions very quickly perhaps because its a limiting story with nowhere new to go.It does have its moments Dylan and Jamies initial bedroom encounter is hilariously awkward. Timberlake and Kunis have a modest amount of chemistry and are backed by a great cast that includes Patricia Clarkson as Jamies flaky bohemian mother; Jenna Elfman as Dylans older sister; and Woody Harrelson as an aggressively gay sports editor (though his performance borders on stereotype). Richard Jenkins gets a lot of mileage out of his role as Dylans ailing father though his characters Alzheimers subplot borders on exploitative. Emma Stone and Andy Samberg have great cameos during the opening scene and Olympic gold-medalist snowboarder Shaun White is enjoyably creepy as an obnoxious Bizarro version of himself (one hopes).However by the time the movie limps toward its predictable very rom-com conclusion in Grand Central Station theres a feeling of ""been there done that.""Friends With BenefitsC+ Starring Mila Kunis Justin Timberlake Woody Harrelson Jenna Elfman Richard Jenkins and Patricia Clarkson.

They naively believe their titular arrangement will solve their problems. Glen Wilson/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Glen Wilson/Sony Pictures Friends With Benefits Director Will Gluck Genre Comedy Running Time 120 minutes Rated R for sexual content and language With Justin Timberlake Mila Kunis Woody Harrelson Patricia Clarkson Richard Jenkins Watch Clips Flash Mob Flash Mob Credit Sony Pictures Bible App Bible App Credit Sony Pictures Saturday Morning Saturday Morning Credit Sony Pictures When Jamie swears she blinks. Thats one of the quirks given to Mila Kunis character in Friends with Benefits intended to show that shes uncomfortable with her own profanity but feels the need to put it out there as a tough front. The same might be said of the movie too a sweet-hearted romantic comedy that is sometimes at odds with its mandated role as a naughty sex comedy. When the movie goes blue it blinks too. Theres a lot of conflict to be found here but for most of the movie none of those tensions seep into the relationship between its two lead characters Jamie and Dylan (Justin Timberlake). They meet in New York when she head-hunts him away from his blog editor job to become art director for GQ. After becoming close friends they come to an agreement They have no desire to be in romantic relationships so why not enjoy some no-strings-attached fun if theyre going to be hanging out all the time anyway? The conflicts of romance are exactly what theyre trying to avoid. Part of that shared aversion to emotional entanglements is expressed through their open mockery of the cliches in a Hollywood romantic comedy they watch together but on this front Friends with Benefits is often at war with itself. How can it be snarky about the treacly conventions of love stories when its headed straight for the same gooey territory itself? When the movie makes fun of itself -- like when the opening chords of the same song that played at the end of the movie-within-a-movie start playing at an opportune moment -- it cleverly pokes fun at the genre. But when it criticizes those films for using manipulative incidental music only to cram the soundtrack with its own manipulative pop songs instead its no better than the rom-coms its skewering. If Jamie and Dylan were to watch Friends with Benefits theyd likely roll their eyes at the tone-deaf writing that has his character who is from L.A. gawping at a flash mob like a small-town farm boy or at dialogue that includes redundant phrases like ""your blog on the Internet"" or ""Nice work on that new online site"" Despite being a movie about two young tech-savvy professionals-- Dylan designs magazine layouts on a massive touchscreen like CNNs John King manipulating an electoral map -- the film often sounds as if it was written by a Luddite who just discovered AOL. i Lorna (Patricia Clarkson left) Jamies loose-cannon mother dispenses sexual advice of a comically inappropriate nature to her daughter. The supporting cast also includes Woody Harrelson as Dylans gay best friend.

The supporting cast also includes Woody Harrelson as Dylans gay best friend. David Giesbrecht/Sony Pictures Still theres no denying the chemistry both emotional and sexual between Kunis and Timberlake. When the film gets away from the exasperating contrivances of the backstory and focuses exclusively on them director Will Gluck reveals the same talent for infusing real emotion into a self-aware comedic setting that was on display in his previous effort Easy A. Their clumsy first encounter is the perfect blend of playful and awkward and when the bedroom romps of the early part of the film later evolve into more complicated emotions Kunis and Timberlake handle the transition with a real tenderness rarely seen in romantic comedies. At that point the movies structural conflicts largely fade away in favor of the more interesting character clashes that finally arise between Jamie and Dylan. Watching these two actors move from being sweetly flirtatious to doing real emotional battle may not entirely compensate for the movies other failings but it goes a long way toward making amends. Kunis and Timberlake are winningly comfortable with one another even if the movie isnt always comfortable with itself.

"Friends With Benefits Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-FilmMovie review Friends With BenefitsThe naked truth? This happily-never-after tale with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis is satisfying for the most part. Except when things turn serious.July 22 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis star in ""Friends With Benefits."" (David Giesbrecht / Associated...)If ever there were a movie betting on the idea that sex sells it is ""Friends With Benefits"" emphasis on the ""benefits."" The naked truth? Slipping a buff Justin Timberlake and a toned Mila Kunis between the sheets as the naughty but nice romantic pair turns the heat up considerably in this happily never after tale. And yet even with all their huffing and puffing this very salty often funny affair is never quite as satisfying as it should be. There was certainly the prospect of pleasure with Will Gluck in the directors chair. The filmmaker showed such an ease in last years clever comic surprise the ""Scarlet Letter"" send-up ""Easy A."" This time he appears to be out to update the classic Tracy-Hepburn love-hurts/words-hurt-more trope. Working with a script that credits Keith Merryman David A. Newman and Gluck the film mixes flash mobs text messaging and touch screens with rat-a-tat verbal parries so rapid you really must pay attention and so raw they would make Dr. Drew blush. (The R-rating is definitely earned). Theres some bi-coastal to and fro but most of the film takes place in New York City. Jamie (Kunis) is a whip smart headhunter trying to lure rising L.A. art director Dylan (Timberlake) to Manhattan for a high-powered gig with GQ magazine. From Jamie and Dylans first meet-cute moment in the airport when he spies her hopping on top of the baggage carousel to retrieve a well its a long story that counts on the comic power of a sign and a short skirt a there is a chemistry that helps buoy the film and a confidence that makes them a good match. And just in case we havent figured out that they are on equal footing for the duration she carries his bags. Even though you know going in that the heart of the matter is whether it really is possible to remain friends while youre ahem reaping the benefits the film takes longer than it should to get to the reaping part. Like the time thats spent at Dylans new office which seems to function as an answer to the question How the heck can we get Woody Harrelson into the film? What they came up with was a bawdy and bold gay GQ sports editor. Harrelson brings his customary quirk and his wild energy but the running ""Are you sure youre not gay?"" joke gets wearing. Bawdy and bold is also the MO for Patricia Clarkson who plays Lorna Jamies libido-driven free-thinking so really cant count on her mom. Even with thin material Clarkson is a treat to watch. As is Richard Jenkins as Dylans dementia-afflicted dad who spends about half his time making brilliant observations about relationships and life and the other half walking around without his pants. In addition to parent issues the writers have Jamie and Dylan dealing with the afterburn of bad breakups so they are more than content to be just hanging out. But as Freud once said a hang out long enough and a hook-up is bound to happen. As Freud also said a hooking up will mess with your mind. Here it doesnt at first until it does and that roller coaster roars through the rest of the film. Whatever the films pitfalls it gives us a far better ride than the similarly sexually conflicted ""No Strings Attached"" which made it to theaters a few months earlier with Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman as romantically uncommitted. What Gluck is quite good at is getting his actors to relax into their roles which brings a lot of natural life to the party. Both Timberlake with ""Social Network"" most recently under his belt and Kunis coming off her ""Black Swan"" star turn are proving to be very appealing actors with a lot of talent to boot. Neither of them take themselves too seriously here an irreverence that keeps their characters likeable even when the film falters. The look thanks to director of photography Michael Grady and the conversations on sex and commitment are open and open-ended. Important issues about the inherent clash between changing mores and traditional values get noodled over a bit. The sex talk is graphic the sex itself is explicit and energetic and Jamie and Dylan have a kind of sweetness that makes you want to root for them. Ironically the problem is that ""Friends With Benefits"" doesnt go far enough when it gets to the substantial stuff. As Freud famously said a even romantic comedies need to take their sex seriously or there will be no satisfaction. Or maybe that was Jagger. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie review Another Happy DayNovember 18 2011Movie review TroubadoursFebruary 4 2011Movie review HeartlessDecember 10 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTFilmDylanFreudJamieCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-friends-with-benefits-20110722,0,3528731.story",200,friendswithbenefits24,friendswithbenefits,latimes

More about Friends With Benefits >> Shes ""emotionally damaged."" The movie emotionally fake. In Friends With Benefits Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are a hot and happening dude and dudette whove maxed out on bad relationships and messy breakups. They like each other a lot. And theyre attracted to each other a lot. So they make a pact Sex yes. Commitment never. If weve seen this setup before (mere months ago with Ashton Kutcher and Kunis Black Swan rival Natalie Portman in No Strings Attached; and last year with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway in Love amp; Other Drugs) so have writers Keith Merryman and David A. Newman and director Will Gluck. I cant think of another recent rom-com that cites other movies and TV shows as rampantly and gratuitously as this one. Heres what I scrawled down Pretty Woman George Clooney Seinfeld Nora Ephron Harry Potter Will amp; Grace It Happened One Night . . . and Im sure there are others I missed. And one of Timberlakes characters running gripes - hes Dylan an art director just moved from L.A. to N.Y.C. to take the reins at GQ - is the music that cues audiences to respond to a meet-cute or a meaningful moment in a romantic comedy. Instead of gleaning something from real life the great minds behind Friends With Benefits slapped their ideas together based on screwball classics Sleepless in Seattle bits and a keen analysis of Hollywood hackery. (Which they proceed to ignore - the music cues in Friends With Benefits are just as manipulative as the ones in the films Dylan critiques.) And lets not even talk about the two ""flash mob"" musical numbers. Timberlake and Kunis - shes Jamie a headhunter who gets Dylan his job luring him away from his gig at a heavily trafficked website - have no trouble conveying their appeal to each other or to us. The sex scenes are raunchy and comic the language R-rated and rat-a-tat-tat. There are iPad jokes and Captain Sully jokes and John Mayer jokes - lest we mistake this for a vintage Tracy/Hepburn vehicle. Olympic snowboarder Shaun White does a goofball cameo and Woody Harrelson plays a proudly gay coworker who commutes to Manhattan from New Jersey via his 1937 Chris Craft. How cool is that? Patricia Clarkson is Jamies kooky unreliable mom. And Richard Jenkins is Dylans dad - who has Alzheimers (but with ""moments of clarity"" reports Jenna Elfman as Dylans sister). Playing the Alzheimers card is particularly offensive and the usually game Jenkins looks pained doing so especially when he must pull the ostensibly funny gag of forgetting to wear his pants in public. But then Timberlake takes his pants off too and everything is right in the world. Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (David Giesbrecht) B- Friends with Benefits Genre Romantic Comedy; Starring Mila Kunis Justin Timberlake Patricia Clarkson; Director Will Gluck; Author Will Gluck Harley Peyton; Release Date Wide 07/22/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 104; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 27 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT In the infectiously smart-mouthed but uneven romantic comedy Friends With Benefits Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis talk and talk and talk -- truly madly glibly. They talk when they meet cute at a New York airport (hes a hot Internet property whos just arrived from L.A. to be interviewed for the position of art director at GQ magazine; shes the corporate headhunter who recruited him). They talk that night when she shows him around the city -- at a swank outdoor bar on a romantic rooftop in the touristy swarms of Times Square where they wind up smack in the middle of a flash mob thats performing ""New York New York."" (Even that doesnt stop them from talking.) They talk as well when they fall into bed a few days later in a sex scene that?s an offhand riot of blunt anatomical specificity. And they talk -- God do they talk -- when they try to pin down the status of their relationship. Lets see They get along famously. They have tons of stuff in common. Theyre both gorgeous. They have amazing sex. (As Bill Maher quipped after Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolies relationship went public ""Why shouldnt the two most beautiful people in the world f-- each other?"") And beyond all that they have an arrangement. Both have been burned once too often by bum relationships so theyll protect themselves from that ever happening again by agreeing to merely be good friends who sleep with each other. They can leave all that messy love stuff out Hell whos got the time for it when you spend all your time talking? Directed by Will Gluck (Easy A) from a script he co-wrote with Keith Merryman and David A. Newman Friends With Benefits at least for a while may be the hookup-generation equivalent of a Rock Hudson/Doris Day gabfest -- an outrageously synthetic confection that pleases and entertains in its very froth. From the fast and furious opening sequence which crosscuts between Timberlakes Dylan and Kunis Jamie each getting dumped the dialogue has an insanely pop-culture-fixated shoot-from-the-brain chattiness. Its peppered with kitschy-pithy observations about Captain Sullenberger John Mayer (""The Sheryl Crow of our generation"") George Clooney and yes cheesy-bad Hollywood romantic comedies. Here as in Easy A and his first film the cheerleader farce Fired Up Gluck favors dialogue thats over-the-top breathless and a bit airless. He knows how to create grabby characters like Woody Harrelson as a proudly gay GQ sports editor who speaks in such matter-of-fact raunch that he seems loopy and weirdly sane at the same moment. (The characterization itself meanwhile dances between enlightened and smugly stereotypical.) In an age of connect-the-dots screenwriting the sheer verbosity of Friends With Benefits is a form of generosity and Gluck has the ideal cast to spew it out. Timberlake with the face of a naughty Roman god has a uniquely charming rhythm Hes laid-back and in overdrive at the same time. As he proved in his brilliant small performance in The Social Network he knows how to play young men who put their hustle right on the surface but what makes him a crackerjack actor is that he always shows you whats behind the words. His darting eyes suss out whats going on in any situation and he uses that quality to give every scene a dramatic snap. Hes a fox in every sense. (He also does a fantastic white-boy mime to Kriss Kross ""Jump."") Mila Kunis with big doe eyes and a mane of slovenly-erotic hair is like Brigitte Bardot gone Sex and the City and her wiseacre ?tude delivered with a slightly flat affect is poised and cynical and amused. I enjoyed Friends With Benefits up to a point but not as much as I wanted to because theres a weirdly fluffy flaw at the movies core. Its clear from the outset that Dylan and Jamie are meant for each other. Every romantic comedy however needs a conflict something that gets in the way of two people realizing that theyre in love. In this case we keep getting told that Dylan is ""emotionally unavailable"" and that Jamie is ""emotionally damaged."" But what we see are two characters who are so charismatic great-looking and sharp in every way that when they meet the people they were meant for (i.e. each other) they can afford to be casual about it because they more or less take their own appeal for granted. Theyre bedroom-romp aristocrats. And that really is all thats standing in their way. Im not exactly sure this is a situation that a lot of people are going to identify with. More to the point it gives the movie a faulty design. Dylan and Jamie sleep together and get along famously. Wheres the dramatic motor? Okay there are a few Complications. Jamie starts dating an earnest physician a subplot that provides Dylan with a temporary ""rival"" although it really goes nowhere. And each of the characters is given one problematic parent. Patricia Clarkson tossing off hilariously discombobulated non sequiturs plays Jamies trapped-in-the-70s flake of a mother and Richard Jenkins plays Dylans dad whos in the early stages of Alzheimers; he knows whats happening to him which just adds to the tragedy. When Dylan takes Jamie along to visit his family the sequence is meant to provide the movie with the requisite touch of gravitas. Instead though it sags. It grows earnest and banal as were now supposed to look at Dylan and feel his pain. Sorry but the movie was more fun when it looked like he didnt have any.

"Friends with Benefits | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; friends-with-benefits ) Friends with Benefits (United States 2011) July 21 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Suddenly it seems that every romantic comedy is using the ""best friend"" branch of the formula. There are no doubt sociological reasons for this perhaps having something to do with the increasing popularity of the ""friend with benefits"" (a.k.a. ""fuckbuddy"") relationship. Or maybe Hollywood is just catching on to something that has long been in the college/young professional mainstream. Either way we are being inundated by these movies. Late last year there was Love and Other Drugs. Early this year there was No Strings Attached. Now we have Friends with Benefits. Theyre essentially all the same movie with different actors. The screenplay for Love and Other Drugs was on a high enough level that it didnt seem like a re-tread. The same cannot be said for the other two. Friends with Benefits is a generic romantic comedy that offers little in the way of surprises. Is that a bad thing or a good thing? After all most lovers of this genre arent interested in surprises. Their concern is that the fantasy is fulfilled and that happens here. The movie is a competent confection which means it will fill the need of audiences in search of a fix in which two young attractive individuals meet fall in love deny their feelings stumble over a roadblock then get together just in time for the end credits. In one of its more clever moments Friends with Benefits makes a self-referential comment when one character wonders why no movies are made showing what happens after the Big Kiss. ""They [are made]"" remarks another person. ""Its called porn."" Friends with Benefits is definitely not porn. Theres some PG-13 nudity but nothing shocking. Justin Timberlake shows his butt more often than Mila Kunis does but theres some brief exposure from both (although Kunis is that of a body double). The R-rating comes not from naked bodies but from raunchy conversation although this is tame by comparison with most recent R-rated comedies. Essentially this is a PG-13 movie that has been ""spiced up"" to increase the target audiences age. If that sounds a lot like No Strings Attached it is except at least in this case theres a little skin (not belonging to Ashton Kutcher). A discussion of the plot is probably unnecessary given that its a product of Screenwriting 101 but a few words may be useful in identifying the principals. Dylan (Timberlake) is the Los Angeles-based editor of a blog that gets 6 million readers per day. He is recruited for a top job at New York-based GQ (the magazine) by a headhunter Jamie (Mila Kunis) who flies him to the East Coast and shows him around the city. He is seduced by New York and the job and relocates. He re-connects with Jamie who becomes his best friend. Later with sexual tension crackling between them they make a pact having to do with emotion-free sex - friendship without romance. This works for the duration of a long montage then complications ensue. Of course they fall for one another but both are afraid of admitting their feelings because they think it will ruin what they have. Kind of like Harry and Sally the sex thing gets in the way. One of the strengths of Friends with Benefits is that Timberlake and Kunis are likeable and display enough chemistry to keep us interested in their inevitable pairing. Were rooting for them to end up together which is a good thing. Timberlake is charming and funny; Kunis is sassy and sexy. They arent the most appealing romantic comedy couple of all-time but theyre not mismatched and neither character is annoying. Especially early in the film their dialogue is often smart and occasionally funny. The supporting cast is outstanding; the casting director (Lisa Miller) deserves a mention for hiring the likes of Patricia Clarkson (as Jamies oversexed Mom) and Richard Jenkins (as Dylans Alzheimers afflicted Dad). Stalwart veterans who never phone it in they do a lot with minimal screen time. Woody Harrelson is hilarious as the macho gay GQ sports editor with his own mode of transportation to and from work. There are welcome cameos from Andy Samberg Emma Stone and Jason Segel (who was Kunis love interest in Forgetting Sarah Marshall). This is director Will Glucks second effort to fall into the ""better than one might suspect"" category. With Friends with Benefits as with Easy A he has shown the ability to bring freshness to a stale foundation and to coax strong performances from his actors. Friends with Benefits is unchallenging but easy to like. Theres not enough here to capture the interest of those indifferent to romantic comedies but fans - even of the casual variety - will find this to be a pleasant mid-summer diversion. Between all the explosions and superhero action its nice to take a break and watch two people predictably fall in love.

Headhunted by Jamie (Mila Kunis) Angeleno Dylan (Justin Timberlake) moves to New York to become the art director of GQ. She shows him around town and they commiserate about past relationships then try to prove theyre capable of sex without commitment through the usual montage of aerobic rutting (supplemented with Kuniss obvious body double). Directed and co-written by Will Gluck (Easy A) FWB cant stop reminding you what an above-it-all romantic comedy it thinks it is taking digs at Katherine Heigl and Nora Ephron. The hypocrisy becomes even more galling during a saccharine subplot involving Dylans Alzheimers-addled dad (Richard Jenkins a delightful actor squandered much like Patricia Clarkson as Jamies raunchy mom). But whats most crushing is witnessing what should have been the dream pairing of Kunis and Timberlake--both foxy loose confident performers--here generating zero chemistry. Kunis seems to have forgotten how to use her inside voice; her screeching in turn prompts her male lead to speak in even higher tinnier registers. Maybe some studio will get it right with the sure-to-be-coming-soon Fuck Buddies.

"Friends With Benefits movie review by Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Friends benefits from familiar premise better castTimberlake and Kunis improve hookup tale -- 3 starsJuly 21 2011|Michael PhillipsMila Kunis stars in ""Friends With Benefits.""Since American media sexualizes almost everything except sex Hollywood romantic comedies about two people making hey-hey without any big plans for any big future rarely come easily or operate from a spirit of carnal delight. The strain of being hip and loose yet mindful of the conventional even Puritanical rom-com imperatives is too much to handle. Leave complicated sexual lives to the French many Americans mutter even as they secretly envy the easy Gallic flirtation not to mention their attention to detail when it comes to a salad.This year ""No Strings Attached"" presented Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher -- a real actress co-starring with a chalk outline of a leading man -- as two halves of a sustained casual fling inching toward love and a substantive relationship. Now showcasing the hyperactively entertaining pair of Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis we have the more interesting and energetic ""Friends With Benefits."" Were running out of titles for romantic comedies based on this premise. ""Were Just Blanking"" may be the last one left.""No relationship. No emotions. Just sex"" So says the hotshot website art director played by Timberlake recruited from his California gig for a New York City job as GQ magazines design head. (The film takes place in a strange distant time before the recession when people flew on airplanes with tickets paid for by prospective employers.) The woman hes pitching an executive headhunter played by Kunis says shes up for it.The newbie and his savvy Manhattan sponsor fall into a fast friendship. They fit. Hes ""emotionally unavailable"" still smarting over his mother leaving his now-Alzheimers-addled father played with his usual light-fingered skill by Richard Jenkins; shes ""emotionally damaged"" (in a perky edgy way) the daughter of a boozy free spirit perpetually between relational engagements played by Patricia Clarkson. Why not throw in some intercourse?Clarkson appeared in the ensemble of director Will Glucks previous film ""Easy A"" which starred Emma Stone and percolated very nicely from the writing to Glucks brisk direction. ""Friends With Benefits"" is coarser. (Sensitive souls recovering from the grungier bits in ""Horrible Bosses"" might want to wait a week or two.) But it zips along. The script by Gluck Keith Merryman and David A. Newman has a serrated edge and neither of the leading roles begs for audience sympathy. Glucks feature deals every which way with children of divorce and/or single parents looking for love. Theyre trying to chart a course toward something more authentic than the drippy scenes were shown from a fake romantic comedy (wonderfully acted by Jason Segel and Rashida Jones) watched at different points in ""Friends With Benefits"" by Jamie and Dylan. I enjoy both Timberlake and Kunis; just this side of manic they seem right together.Like so much we see and hear in R-rated rom-coms these days the movies raunch has its pushy side. So does the editing by Tia Nolan which chops up simple and often very funny bits of dialogue into bits better left alone to breathe visually. These things matter because they affect how we relate to the people on screen. Still enough goes right to compensate for what doesnt quite. You can probably guess the ending. Then again I doubt Hollywood will ever make a movie about casual sex that turns serious where you cant guess the ending.mjphillipstribune.comFriends With Benefits -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content and language)Cast Justin Timberlake (Dylan); Mila Kunis (Jamie); Patricia Clarkson (Lorna); Jenna Elfman (Annie); Richard Jenkins (Mr. Harper); Bryan Greenberg (Parker); Woody Harrelson (Tommy)Credits Directed by Will Gluck; written by Keith Merryman David A.

(AP Photo/Sony Screen Gems David Giesbrecht) They say that if you scratch a cynic youll find a disappointed idealist. The corollary in ""Friends with Benefits"" is that if you scratch him just right hell roll over and act like a sexual plaything before confessing hes really a romantic.""Friends with Benefits"" is a bait-and-switch comedy. It poses as a naughty ""no-mance"" about friends who use each other for casual sex but at the moment of truth it goes limp. In place of fearless physicality it offers two personable leads some mildly quirky cohorts and a light serving of the sentimentality it pretends to sneeze at.Dylan (Justin Timberlake) is an LA art director who is lured to GQ magazine in New York by executive recruiter Jamie (Mila Kunis). As she gives him a tour of the hot spots they become tight friends who bemoan the phoniness of the mating game. After the friends agree to have sex with no emotional strings attached their frank instructions about bedroom turn-ons generate some titters. But the lack of actual nudity becomes suspicious and so does the soundtrack of manipulative pop songs like the ones that Jamie and Dylan detest.Sure enough when their cute-coupleness is noted by friends and family members (her hippie mom Patricia Clarkson his addled dad Richard Jenkins meddlesome sister Jenna Elfman and aggressively gay co-worker Woody Harrelson) things get sticky. But any movie where attractive twenty-somethings can jet from Manhattan to Malibu to fret about the feelings that are complicating their sex lives isnt interested in plowing new territory. As a predictable romantic fantasy ""Friends with Benefits"" profits from two lively and likable stars who maintain our interest. But as the sexual satire in which we invested theres no payoff.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Perhaps fitting for a movie about pals looking for sex without commitment Friend With Benefits wants to have it both ways It decries the ""lies"" of Katherine Heigl romantic comedies yet follows the same script. It shuns the wuss-rock stylings of John Mayer yet gooses up the soundtrack with a drippy solo acoustic version of ""Boys Dont Cry."" And it affects a cooler-than-thou attitude while transcending the genre in precisely zero ways. Director Will Gluck adopted the same tone for his last effort Easy A which also embraced all the cliches it loudly purported to explode but just as a great star turn from Emma Stone saved that film Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis save this one. In the early going especially before their casual hook-ups are swamped by complications their chemistry is so electric that the entire movie could have survived (and thrived) on 90 minutes of pillow talk. Instead theres baggage and lots of it. First seen getting dumped on separate coasts Timberlake and Kunis meet cute in a New York airport where Kunis a headhunter arrives to shuttle Timberlake to an interview for an open position as GQs new art director. After much cajoling Kunis convinces Timberlake to leave L.A. for New York and since shes the only person he knows in the city Timberlake turns to her for friendship. Having both been burned by love they initially resist the urge to follow through on what two impossibly witty beautiful compatible young people like themselves would normally be inclined to do. But like a lot of movie couples recently--Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman in No Strings Attached Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway in Love And Other Drugs--they try to divorce casual super-fun sex from emotional consequence. From there Friends With Benefits feels overly inclined to explain why theyre so screwed up bringing in Kunis hippie-dippie mother (Patricia Clarkson) who commits to nothing and Timberlakes Alzheimers-afflicted father (Richard Jenkins) whose wife divorced him when the going got tough. Clarkson and Jenkins bring impressive dimension to their characters but whenever the film gets away from Timberlake and Kunis flirty banter it feels like an unfortunate distraction. Romantic comedies--and this is one in spite of its phony irreverence--turn largely on star power and theirs is transcendent whether theyre casually trading one-liners on the streets or doing running commentary on their sexual escapades. Theyd have been better off staying in bed.

Friends With Benefits Director Will Gluck. Cast Justin Timberlake Mila Kunis Patricia Clarkson. Rating R for sexual content and language. Goody interviews Kunis Timberlake R-rated comedies | SHOWTIMES Wait. Why would you see only one? Or more to the point why would you see any? The question comes up with ""Friends With Benefits"" in which Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis play two single people just getting out of bad breakups who decide that hooking up for the sake of hooking up may be the saner way to go. Have they never been to a movie? Evidently they go to ""No Strings Attached"" the comedy that debuted earlier this year with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher as two single people who decide hooking up for the sake of . . . you get the idea. Not that they are identical even though Kutcher and Kunis are star alums of ""That 70s Show."" In ""No Strings"" the couple try a little harder to achieve a sex-only arrangement while in ""Friends"" Dylan (Timberlake) and Jamie (Kunis) think that constant sex without any of the messiness of romance or love or that sort of thing would help them remain friends which theyve been for a short time. Jamie is a headhunter who lands Dylan an art designer for a website in LA an interview with GQ magazine in New York. There is a goofy misadventure when she picks him up at the airport involving her walking barefoot through the conveyer at baggage claim establishing her as the kind of driven do-anything sort. Dylan isnt sure he wants to move across country but after a tour Jamie promises it wont be like what you see in ""Seinfeld"" - and is then pretty much exactly what you would see in ""Seinfeld"" with one notable exception - he decides to take the job. Jamie is Dylans only friend and he doesnt have a romantic life (despite the best efforts of Woody Harrelson playing an aggressive gay sports editor who continually questions Dylans sexuality). They miss sex they decide over a few beers one thing leads to another and soon Portman and Kutcher . . . oh sorry wrong movie. You can see the pitfalls here. Seriously sort of they embark upon a sexual relationship so casual that they talk about what they had for lunch in the middle of it. But - as they would know if they saw the similarly themed ""Seinfeld"" episode much less ""Strings"" complications inevitably ensue. These include an odd little side story involving Dylans father whose Alzheimers is progressing. (He is played by Richard Jenkins who often seems to play ill older men. Its a living I guess. Whatever the case he acts rings around everyone else.) Dylans sister (Jenna Elfman) misses her brother and would like help with their dad. But she sees that Dylan has real feelings for Jamie even if he cant recognize them himself. You think? (Head slap.) Director and co-writer Will Gluck struggles a bit with consistency of tone here. How could he not? And while Timberlake and Kunis seem to be having a grand old time for the most part other details rankle. For instance a webpage designer wouldnt know what a flash mob is? A small thing sure though a flash mob will play a big role in the story. Patricia Clarkson is kind of funny as Jamies mom an unreformed hippie. And Timberlake and Kunis get in a few good laughs before its over. But with such a well-worn story you cant shake the idea youve seen this kind of thing before - and not just earlier this year. Ironically what ""Friends With Benefits"" shares most with ""No Strings Attached"" is that you can see everything coming with no surprises. Wheres the fun in that?

Engineered to appear transgressive without upsetting auds sense of good old-fashioned commitment ""Friends With Benefits"" stars Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis as sexually liberated adults who attempt to sustain a strictly physical relationship without all those pesky emotional attachments -- treating sex ""like playing tennis."" But even tennis begins with ""love"" and before long sassy irreverence gives way to feeble romantic-comedy conventions. Though unlikely to match the smash success of the summers other R-rated laffers ""Friends"" should draw plenty of couples keen on seeing its attractive cast who show as much skin as possible within the confines of their respective nudity clauses. Written by Keith Merryman David A. Newman and Will Gluck (from a story by Newman Merryman and Harley Peyton) this smarter-than-average script marks the second studio release in nearly six months to tackle the ""sex friends"" phenomenon after Ashton Kutcher-Natalie Portman starrer ""No Strings Attached."" As with that film the raunchy premise here is just a smokescreen for the sort of squarely moralistic altar-bound comedy of which even Jane Austen would approve. Real-life sex buddies typically dont bother with dinner and a movie so the formula must be tweaked to appeal to those who do. Ergo ""Friends With Benefits"" faces a baked-in identity crisis As thoroughly modern twentysomethings Dylan (Timberlake) and Jamie (Kunis) consider themselves immune to all the chick-pic tricks from sentimental music to phony finales -- what Dylan calls ""Prince Charming shit."" But surely they doth protest too much for the two happen to be starring in precisely the sort of film they so openly denounce replete with pop songs and Cameron Crowe-worthy declarations of love. Director Gluck (""Easy A"") treats ""Friends With Benefits"" like a fresh spin on an old Tracy and Hepburn scenario to the extent that you could lift the sexual element right out of the movie and still be left with a feature-length screwball comedy Executive headhunter Jamie invites Los Angeles-based art director Dylan to New York where she sets him up with a dream job at GQ magazine. In order to make her commission Jamie must ensure that Dylan keeps the job for a year so she gives him a personal tour of the city and invites him into her circle of friends. Insert no-strings-shagging subplot here. Its intercourse without intimacy that Dylan and Jamie both seek recognizing that after a decade of failed relationships theyre both too emotionally damaged to try dating again anytime soon. So its straight to the bedroom resulting in the films most uproarious setpiece as the two bedmates freed from the tyranny of trying to impress one another find the confidence to assert their idiosyncratic likes and dislikes. But the script exhausts its originality awfully quickly with subsequent hookups recycling jokes from other movies including that overused gag where both parties claim it was a one-time thing before passionately going at it again. Cutesy iPad and flashmob scenes suggest opportunistic fad association more than genuine pop-culture proficiency which could explain why the script seems so clueless about the logistics of actual ""sex friends"" relationships which tend to dissolve around the time a dateable third party comes along. Having already given Patricia Clarkson the funniest role of her career in ""Easy A"" Gluck once again taps the actress comedic side to play Jamies man-eating mom who embarrasses the couple by showing up unannounced during one of their sleepovers (the overnight component being the first clue the sex isnt as casual as they think). As things get more serious Dylan flies Jamie to L.A. for the Fourth of July weekend making her the first girl hes introduced to his family played by Richard Jenkins Jenna Elfman and ""Modern Familys"" Nolan Gould. With a supporting cast of this caliber (including Woody Harrelson as GQs unapologetically gay sports editor and Emma Stone and Andy Samberg as angry exes) the pic lands most of its laughs -- this despite the fact that scenes teased in trailers but absent from the film suggest last-minute tweaks. Jason Segel and Rashida Jones even turn up uncredited in a sappy film-within-the-film spelling out the kind of romantic comedy ""Friends With Benefits"" desperately doesnt want to be. And yet from its sitcom-style lighting to the artificial misunderstandings introduced to wedge apart the would-be lovers this sheep in wolfs clothing proves as predictable and benign as everything thats come before. Pics key revelation is paying off the gamble of its two leads Kunis is a natural with comedy and now we know she can carry a movie while Timberlake exudes the kind of star wattage that put Will Smith on top.

TWITTER Not only do Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis handle the tart banter with an assured playful give-and-take in Will Glucks grown-up romantic comedy butasurprise surpriseathereas actually a palpable chemistry between them. Ashton and Natalie may have beaten them to the ""just sex"" punch line with No Strings Attached but Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis do it better--and more enjoyably--in Friends With Benefits. A crisply contemporary notably grown-up romantic comedy directed and co-written by Easy A director Will Gluck the bicoastal picture goes a long way in bringing sexy back to a soggy genre benefiting greatly from the presence of its likable leads. Not only do they handle the tart banter with an assured playful give-and-take but--surprise surprise--they also manage to exhibit an extremely rare big-screen quality Theres actually a palpable chemistry between them. Even though the postmodern vehicle ultimately proves guilty of adhering too closely to those very same tired rom-com conventions at which it satirically pokes fun its fresh-faced attractive leads inject it with a winning vitality. That vibe should help audiences brush aside the initial sensation of deja vu and make this Screen Gems release an attractive proposition in its own right. Immediately establishing a brisk pace suited to a film set in both New York and Los Angeles Gluck dispenses with any creaky plot mechanics that will slow down the business at hand--bringing together hot-shot L.A.-based media art director Dylan (Timberlake) and Manhattan-based corporate headhunter Jamie (Kunis). Not only does adventurous Jamie manage to persuade him to relocate to the East Coast for a dream gig calling the shots at GQ they find themselves jumping into each others arms among other various body parts even though both are still smarting from recently terminated relationships. Despite Jamie and Dylans mutual declaration to maintain a strictly physical relationship darned if those pesky emotions dont manage to creep their way into those best-laid plans. Working from Keith Merryman and David Newmans sharply observed casually au courant script to whch he contributed Gluck clearly had vintage Hepburn-Tracy sophisticated comedy in the back of his head while working out the style and tempo of the production. He also mines healthy--and well-deserved--laughs from making fun of the current state of studio romantic comedies with a mock film-within-the-film featuring an unbilled Jason Segel and Rashida Jones along with virtually every rom-com cliche under the sun. But he also succumbs to many of those very same trappings as the film progresses including the staging of not one but two choreographed flash mob sequences--a YouTube phenom that already felt past its prime when Howie Mandel hosted a hidden-camera special earlier this year. The hypocritical element aside Gluck not only draws terrific performances from Kunis and Timberlake (fresh from their respective career-best turns in Black Swan andThe Social Network) but from a crack supporting cast. Woody Harrelson handily steals his handful of scenes as Timberlakes office colleague--a gung-ho gay mans man--while the ever-reliable Patricia Clarkson shines as Kunis hazy-around-the-edges aging 70s groupie of a mom. Jenna Elfman puts in an effective turn as Timberlakes world-weary big sister.
