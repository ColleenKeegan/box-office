Directed by Troy Nixey in an elegant style that recalls classic ghost stories it pays loving attention to characterisation atmosphere and design. Yet there is something academic about its skilfully calibrated supernatural scares - like the lovingly restored late-Victorian house in which it is set - leaving the film looking beautiful yet somehow embalmed.After an arresting opening in which the master of Blackwood House lures a housemaid to the dark basement and makes a macabre ritualistic offering that brings a whole new meaning to the The Tooth Fairy myth the action flashes forward a century to the present. The modern-day occupants of the house - architect Alex Hirst (Guy Pearce) his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) and Alexs young daughter from his failed marriage Sally (Bailee Madison) - are drawn in turn to the secret places beneath its light and airy interiors.The one major change from the 70s film is that the protagonist the architects wife in the original is now a child Sally. Arriving unexpectedly as her busy and neglectful fathers renovation project nears its completion the lonely Sally rejects his girlfriends friendly overtures and falls prey to the whispering voices of the skittering homunculi who call out to her in the dark Come and play with us Sally. There is so much here that one admires one wishes that there was more to love.

I can only assume that most of the negative reviews are from people who enjoy cheap scare tactic cinema. Im a fan of Del Toro amp; can easily see why he has put his name to this story. I was really worried this film would let me down after reading peoples opinions amp; I almost gave it a miss in the cinema. I shouldnt have worried as this to me was on par with The Orphanage. It may not be the same type of film but for the story it told it was perfect. This is a classic horror tale about creatures evil creatures waiting in the dark amp; you should not go into this expecting to see Paranormal Activity or some other one trick pony. Pans Labyrinth had elements of horror yet it was never really scary... This film reminded me allot of Pans as it had the same fairy tale aspect going on. The script was very strong amp; not once did I roll my eyes at a stupid decision made by the parents or the young girl everything flowed just right. Great horror movie amp; perfect for Halloween. You may not be scared but its still a creepy dark amp; violent story well worth a watch Four stars is a my rating )FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 26 2011SandraFeaturedI did nothing but laugh all the way threw one of the worst films Ive ever seen in my life dont waist your moneyFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 12 2011Lesley WhittakerFeaturedDont be afraid of the dark... what can I say One spine chilling film.... well worth seeing thoughFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyOct 12 2011disappointed filmgoerFeaturedThis was marketed as a horror film - but I cant really understand why.

And so here we are again faced with a del Toro-produced/co-written update that evokes the era of gothic tension well without entirely dousing itself in gore or goofy effects. Sally (Bailee Madison) is a lonely little girl drugged up by her short-sighted mother and dragged across the country into the reluctant care of her preoccupied father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes). Theyve moved into a grand Rhode Island estate worthy of Shirley Jackson hoping to renovate it enough to earn the attention of Architectural Digest and as such Sally finds herself neglected again and lured in by the promise of attention from the mysterious voices down in the basement... Amid the seasons Fright Nights and Shark Nights and Final Destinations this version is a welcome alternative to the current genre offerings steeped in old-fashioned atmosphere and faithful to the haunted house routine albeit to a fault. Del Toro co-writer Matthew Robbins and first-time feature director Troy Nixey have opted to do away with cell phones and computers; in fact the closest bid for modern technology is Kims knack for collecting Polaroid cameras the flashes of which prove quite handy at simultaneously providing protection from light-phobic creatures and potentially presenting proof of their existence to certain skeptical adults (read all of them save for the wary handyman). Del Toro and Robbins screenplay curiously incorporates established tooth-fairy lore (before spelling out the particulars of the mythos in a groan-inducing second-act library sequence -- hey at least its not a mere Google search) and the creatures though revealed a bit too early and often for their own good are right nasty little things and a marked improvement over the dated puppetry of the original. Theres a welcome dose of Freudian implications lending the title a more psychological reading as Sally finds herself in an old house but not necessarily a new home dealing with beasts that literally rise from the depths -- not just hidden in a concealed basement but even further beneath the house -- while Mom parties and Dad works and Kim tries her damnedest to not feel like the evil stepmother. That gradual bonding between Kim and Sally is where Holmes performance is best served. Its suggested (but not explained) that her character has had childhood trauma of her own to contend with so her empathy and willingness to give Sally the benefit of the doubt feels dictated by character rather than circumstance. This doesnt mean that Holmes doesnt fall prey to laughably wide-eyed inquisition (see the aforementioned library sequence) but in a film where Pearces performance is a touch too disaffected for its own good she manages a much-needed feat of being convincingly concerned. However the real star of the show is Madison pulling off a remarkably graceful mix of initial petulance gradual curiosity and eventual alarm. While making the lead a child this time instead of an adult her turn doesnt take the built-in vulnerability of a kid in peril for granted. (Darby was arguably shriller in her nocturnal encounters with the knee-high fiends than Madison is here.) The strongest case to be made for the films nonetheless flimsy R rating is that very endangerment of a child throughout but our young lead prevents that angle from feeling especially exploitative or cheap. Nixeys penchant for establishing and maintaining a menacing atmosphere offsets the slightly slack pacing and occasionally limp performances. Dont Be Afraid of the Dark isnt so much predictable as it is content with unfolding like a good old bedtime story often creepy but never without a sense of fun on the part of the storyteller.

MATTHEW HAYS The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 26 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English From the possessed doll in the classic episode of Rod Serlings seventies TV series Night Gallery to the clown under the bed in Poltergeist to the serial-killer doll Chucky theres always been a special place in the horror genre for little scary things. And horror icon Guillermo del Toro ( Cronos Pans Labyrinth) decided to celebrate the sheer terror such little fry can evoke by reaching back to a little-known 1973 made-for-TV movie with a cult following Dont Be Afraid of the Dark. Shot on a shoestring that film featured a couple who are horrified to learn the house theyve moved into is haunted by tiny murderous beings unleashed when a long-abandoned fireplace is unsealed. The catch was the woman was the only one who could see the critters while they never revealed themselves to the husband until it was too late. Screen grab from the online trailer for the new remake of the horror film ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" Movies Dont Be Afraid of the Dark The official trailer video Video Child star talks about being afraid of the dark It may seem an odd source for a lavish feature film with grade-A production values but del Toros long fight to bring the new Dont Be Afraid of the Dark to the big screen has paid off. He and co-screenwriter Matthew Robbins have altered the family dynamic adding a troubled child Sally (Bailee Madison) to the mix. It is Sally who first hears the little ones hissing through the air vents insisting they want to be friends. After discovering a basement they thought didnt exist and a fireplace thats been sealed in a manner that suggests Dont open this they do just that and then all hell breaks loose. This would all fall apart if you didnt have such a convincing cast. Sally is blamed after the critters shred some clothes with a knife - a bad sign if ever there was one - and all of the family woes are soon attributed to the pop-psychology theory that Sallys parents divorce and her alienation from dads girlfriend (Katie Holmes) are causing her to act out. Holmes turns in a strong performance as the one who begins to wonder if Sally isnt actually telling the truth. The filmmakers have neatly rolled several movies into one theres a family melodrama (while Guy Pearces soulless yuppie character is a bit overplayed hes still effective) a great big Victorian haunted house a kiddie in peril and another foray into the creepy-critter horror sub-genre. Perhaps one of the biggest differences between the new Dont Be Afraid and the original would be the use of CGI in the remake. This is both a blessing and a curse. When we do actually get to see the critters they are indeed nasty - hairy fanged beady-eyed. And director Troy Nixey made the choice to try to hold off on showing them to us until well into the film. But as we know from films like Jaws and Pontypool often whats most scary is what we cant see that which is left to our imagination. Dont get me wrong this is still a seriously entertaining horror movie one that will please newcomers as well as fans of the original oddity. But by the end of the film I was wishing the filmmakers had left us wondering about precisely who and what these critters were just a little bit longer. Ultimately theres nothing scarier than not knowing what lurks in the dark.

Dont Be Afraid of the Dark (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Dont Be Afraid of the Dark (R) Writer-producer Guillermo del Toros homage to a film which affected him as a kid doesnt have the same impact. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald8/26/2011 Editor rating 2 Guillermo del Toro was 9 years old when he saw the 1973 TV movie Dont Be Afraid of the Dark an experience that would help shape his adult psyche as a master craftsman in the fantasy and horror genres. Del Toro co-wrote and produced his affectionate yet ineffectual remake but he handed the directorial reins to first-timer Troy Nixey. The finished movie still bears heavy traces of del Toros presence which only makes watching it more frustrating. Dont Be Afraid of the Dark often recalls del Toros Oscar-winning Pans Labyrinth another story about a little girl who discovers not all monsters are make-believe. But this time the material comes off as superficial kids stuff. A big part of the problem comes in the casting. Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes -- the kind of odd pairing of actors that comes only after your first and second choices have passed -- are unconvincing and curiously unsympathetic as the architect Alex and his girlfriend. The unlikely couple is finishing an extensive restoration of the Blackwood Manor a sprawling estate whose original owner disappeared. Starting with the prologue Dont Be Afraid of the Dark leaves no doubt there are creatures living in the basement of the mansion -- creatures that have awakened with the arrival of Alex Kim and his 9-year-old daughter Sally (Bailee Madison). The girl is the one who commands the monsters attention since they feed on childrens teeth and they are starving. Nixey and del Toro make you wait to get a good look at the tiny predators but they are worthy of the build-up -- demon-faced gnomes who may have come from another planet and are sensitive to bright lights. Madison also fares better than her adult co-stars in making us care about what happens to her character. In the films best and most suspenseful sequence one of the critters attacks Sally in bed as shes hiding underneath her blankets. The scene is destined to haunt childrens nightmares if they could see it The bizarre R-rating on the film which was granted more for overall impact and not specific adult content will keep away audiences who would have appreciated the movie the most. With Dont Be Afraid of the Dark del Toro wanted all of us to feel like he did when he was 9 and seeing another incarnation of this story for the first time. But despite all the care that has been put into it the film doesnt transcend its dime-store horror roots. Neither scary nor original -- at least to grown-ups -- Dont Be Afraid of the Dark ends up feeling like a personal obsession del Toro needed to get out of his system before he could move on.

"Dont Be Afraid of the Dark review Chilling remake emphasizes terror over gore |       NJ.com comments Dont Be Afraid of the Dark review Chilling remake emphasizes terror over gore Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on August 26 2011 at 804 AM View/Post Comments MiramaxKatie Holmes left and Bailee Madison in a scene from the film ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark."" The end of the summer is usually the bottom of the barrel for studios -- here come the unfunny comedies the lame action movies the 3D schlock pictures desperate to steal your last dollar. So lets make this clear fast ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" is the seasons scariest horror film -- and depending on what the next few months bring perhaps the years. Its based on a movie-of-the-week thats so old -- well so old that the networks were still making movies of the week back then. With Kim Darby and Jim Hutton no less. But it was nasty -- with wee beasties hiding in an old homes basement waiting for a new family to move in. And its even nastier now with Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce as the couple and Bailee Madison as the little girl the creatures want most of all. The film is directed by newcomer Troy Nixey who comes out of comic-book art but the guiding intelligence is undoubtedly that of director Guillermo del Toro who co-wrote the screenplay and produced. And his influences -- both dark and literary -- are easy to spot. It wont escape serious horror fans for example that the first family to inhabit the spectral mansion here was named Blackwood or that the name Machen gets dropped -- both are Victorian authors who specialized in ancient fantasies. Those touches are clearly del Toros -- as is a story built around a lonely and terrified child in a huge and forbidding house and an emphasis on grotesque terror over gory horror. Other participants may have exercised other influences. Or is it hypersensitive to note the many slams in this Katie Holmes film against psychiatrists psychotropic drugs ADHD and other medical issues loudly attacked by Scientology? Its emphasized just enough to be noticeable (Adderall is called out by name and were told Pearces ex the human villain of the piece even ""medicated her dogs""). Did hubby Tom have a hand in a rewrite? But it all fades quickly once the real monsters come out. The CGI isnt the best but smartly the filmmakers keep the creatures in the shadows as much as possible. And they amp up the retro atmosphere drawing on everything from the houses architecture (it may be the scariest movie manse since ""The Haunting"") to the requisite mysterious handyman and inopportune thunderstorms. The slightly unexpected casting actually helps the project too. Holmes who frankly looks a bit haggard is believable as the beleaguered girlfriend; Pearce never the warmest of actors is just the cold fish this distant father would be. And young Bailee Madison -- who is thankfully not a factory-made moppet but a round-faced frowning little child -- is while a bit too quick to accept the monsters convincingly terrified once she realizes theyre not coming out to play. So dont be afraid of the last weeks of summer; go see ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark."" Just dont blame me if afterward you cant take its titular advice to heart. Ratings note The film contains violence and frightening images. Dont be Afraid of the Dark (R) Film District/Miramax (99 min.) Directed by Troy Nixey. With Katie Holmes Guy Pearce Bailee Madison.

""Childrens teeth Childrens teeth"" Unseen spooky critters hiding deep in a fireplace in a walled-off room whisper these words like steam pipes. As they do ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" will turn your nerve endings to Popsicles. This fantastically creepy haunted-house yarn produced and co-written by Guillermo Del Toro and directed with terrifying flair by comic-book artist Troy Nixey harks back to a 1960s idea of what a horror film should be. (Its a remake of a 1973 TV movie that starred Kim Darby.) Before the slasher flick came along the scarefest was all about unease and the uncanny with maybe two minutes of violence in the whole production. It was plenty. So we get a teddy bear that starts to move (""I love you I love you"") an internally lit carousel on a bed table that casts shadows that devour the walls -- and those skittering sprites under the bed or in the ventilation ducts telling a 9-year-old girl ""We waaaant to be your frieeeeeend"" The tension gets to the point that the mere sight of a maid drawing a bath is enough to creep you out. PHOTOS HIGH-BROW HORROR The girl Sally (an excellent Bailee Madison) has just left her mom in LA to move into a crumbling Rhode Island mansion being refurbished by her architect dad Alex (Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes). Alex is broke having sunk his last cent into this project which he hopes will win him the cover of Architectural Digest. This house is more likely to make the cover of Fangoria. Sally who thanks to her overprotective mom is an Adderall-stuffed gluten-phobe is already frazzled around the edges. Its understandable that she might have unpleasant dreams and Alex is slow to recognize that shes being terrorized by tiny demons. In a prologue set in olden days we learn why. A previous owner of the house couldnt satisfy the wee beasties craving for childrens teeth. Adult teeth wont do. Nixey tightens the suspense at every opportunity roaming the propertys slightly seedy hedges and dim hallways while keeping the colors muted and bleary. Outdoors it always seems to be about 5 p.m. in October. Inside youll be begging for halogen track lights. We dont get a good look at the little monsters -- until we do and they look like the Gremlins badass cousins from the rough side of town. Later things get repetitive as Sally suffers a series of close encounters and gathers more and more evidence that these arent hallucinations. The movie could have been cleverer about leaving it open that the girl whos also a gifted artist might merely possess an overstimulated imagination or be fabricating a crisis because she doesnt like Dads girlfriend. Meanwhile Alexs intransigence becomes increasingly indefensible. How many pictures of the goblins will convince him? And why isnt he more curious about the circumstances under which the handyman was nearly ripped to shreds by a swarm of tiny claws? Nor is the climax completely satisfying given Sallys relative passivity. Still the very last twist is suitably strange and chilling and the films unremitting potency is a rare thing. Free up some space in your nightmare schedule. Youre going to need it.

The Weinstein Company By John Anderson August 26 2011 ""Our Idiot Brother"" about a preternaturally guileless hippie named Ned and his three weird sisters has a title designed to tickle Idiot brother? Some of us have one. Some of us are one. Its a title that seems to tell you everything you need to know about the film--like say ""Snakes on a Plane."" Just one more entry in the seemingly inexhaustible parade of loser comedies. Right? Not quite. View a scene from ""Our Idiot Brother"" starring Paul Rudd. Courtesy Weinstein Company. The muttonhead of the title is portrayed by the eminently likable Paul Rudd who has brought an ironic self-awareness to many slacker comedies a category that would include ""Our Idiot Brother""--if ""Our Idiot Brother"" werent also an allegorical social critique inspired by Fyodor Dostoevsky and his collaborator Jesus Christ. Directed by Jesse Peretz--and co-written by his sister Vanity Fair contributor Evgenia Peretz and her husband David Schisgall--the film finds comedy in contemporary mores; satire in hypocrisy; and inspiration in Dostoevskys ""The Idiot."" In that novel the hero Prince Myshkin possessed such goodness he was judged insane and sent to a sanitarium. Upon emerging his life is dominated by three sisters. Eventually he goes back to the madhouse. Likewise Ned sort of Its his innate decency that prompts him to give a bag of pot to a uniformed police officer; the cop whos been crying the blues to get the pot then insists on paying so he can properly arrest Ned for trafficking. Off Ned goes to the hoosegow where he becomes a popular prisoner and gets released early then meanders back to the organic farm he shared with his girlfriend the loathsome Janet (a great Kathryn Hahn) on the assumption that life as he knew it will resume. No way Janet has taken up with another airhead Billy (T.J. Miller) and unceremoniously evicts Ned from the farm. She wont even give him custody of Willie Nelson his very mellow golden retriever. Paroled and homeless Ned is remanded to that place where when you have to go there they have to take you in Moms. With his long hair beard blissful mien and empathetic nature Ned is the embodiment of those qualities we idealize in theory and often recoil from in the flesh pure goodness; an utterly frank nature; a propensity for saying the wrong (aka truthful) thing at the wrong time. While everyone in his dubious family extended and otherwise is painfully aware of Neds supposed shortcomings he is blithely oblivious to theirs. Which takes some doing Selfish and self-absorbed theyre state-of-the-art hipsters who provide themselves all manner of moral alibis through holier-than-thou lifestyle options. One sister Natalie (Zooey Deschanel) is in a committed relationship with lawyer Cindy (Rashida Jones) although she beds down with just about anyone. Another Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) a writer for a monthly magazine is happy to exploit Neds people skills to get a juicy story out of a high-profile subject--and to involve Ned in a cover-up when her ethics are questioned. Sister Liz (Emily Mortimer) and her husband Dylan (Steve Coogan) are helicopter parents. Oppressive. Superior. Hovering. When Ned offers their son a snack he is told in no uncertain terms that the young lad has already had his weekly cupcake. When Ned shows his nephew a movie on his laptop he is chastised by Dad. (""This country is obsessed with screens"") Nevermind that Dylan is a documentary filmmaker. Or that hes sleeping with his next subject a Russian ballerina. Ned meanwhile bounces like a beachball over the speed bumps of life always forgiving except of himself When hes hit on at a party by a couple interested in a threesome Ned tries to go along but ultimately cant--and then apologizes profusely for his inability to shortcircuit his own sexual orientation. Its a very touching scene no pun intended and not exactly apolitical. ""My Idiot Brother"" might have made Ned more of a symbol and less of a person. Where the filmmakers and Mr. Rudd go right is making him such a round and sympathetic figure rather than the desperate pathetic and/or slapstick character he might have been in different hands. ""Our Idiot Brother""--not ""My"" or ""Your"" or ""Their"" idiot brother--is goofily funny and silly and in many ways follows the currents of contemporary comedy into the gulf stream of inanity. And yet Ned turns out to be a strangely moving figure a comic foil worthy of affection perhaps even respect. ENLARGE Sam Riley and Andrea Riseborough in Brighton Rock. IFC Brighton Rock Graham Greenes conflicted Catholicism was the root of his novels spiritual gravitas--""The Power and the Glory"" (1940) being an obvious example. Less well-known is Greenes 1938 ""Brighton Rock"" a pulp-fictional tale of low-lifes scuttling about the English beach resort which has now been given a glorious gloss by director Rowan (son of Roland) Joffe. Expanded visually beyond anything resembling the comparatively claustrophobic 1947 film (which starred a wonderfully scrofulous Richard Attenborough) and imbued with a feverish morality that would have gratified Mr. Greene himself the film is almost distractingly beautiful to look at something that accentuates the tension between the films conflicting quantities i.e. the glories of the physical world and the corrupted humanity it hosts. In keeping with the current media mania for the early 1960s ""Brighton Rock"" has been updated to 1964 and the time of the Mods-Rockers riots. Its was an era when men were men and women were not and a naive waitress like Rose (Andrea Riseborough) could be swept off her feet by the likes of Pinkie Brown (Sam Riley) a not-quite-up-and-coming gangster who has killed a fellow hood and needs Rose as his alibi. As Pinkie wearing a nasty razor slash across his cheek tries to avoid being rubbed out Rose falls stupidly in love with him causing her devoted employer Ida (Helen Mirren) to try and rescue her from his clutches. In the midst of all the noirish goings-on the couples shared Catholicism provides a tortured moral backdrop to their relationship and to Pinkies criminality. His religion doesnt seem to affect his outlook on murder but it certainly governs his relationship to sex and marriage What should have produced cognitive dissonance seems to make sense to our ill-fated pair even as they swirl around the drain to perdition. Mr. Joffe keeps things moving and cinematographer John Mathieson (""Gladiator"" ""Robin Hood"") shooting in a widescreen format makes rapturous use of the sky and sea around Brighton where often below the lower edge of the frame ugly matters are afoot. View a scene from ""Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark"" Courtesy FilmDistrict. Dont Be Afraid of the Dark The original 1973 telefilm frightened a 10-year-old Mexican named Guillermo del Toro into becoming the pre-eminent fantasist of world cinema. So the remake of ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark""--directed by Troy Nixey produced by Mr. Del Toro and starring Katie Holmes and Guy Pearce--would seem to promise a few revelations either regarding the state of cinema or the state of Mr. del Toro. What it has to say mostly regards the importance of casting. Mr. Nixey a comic-book artist short-film maker and del Toro protege forsakes the ha-ha-horror approach to movie dread in favor of an old-fashioned creepfest replete with creatures shadows and imperiled children--in his case Sally (Bailee Madison) who has come to live with her father Alex (Mr. Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Ms. Holmes) in a decaying hulk of a house infested with scurrying ratlike demons. The houses original owner who comes and very abruptly goes in the films gruesome opening flashback (the foyer of the story one might say) was a famous designer a la William Morris and if Alex and Kim can restore the house to its Arts and Craft origins they can get on the cover of Architectural Digest. Daughter be damned. ENLARGE Katie Holmes in Dont Be Afraid of the Dark. Miramax And the daughter dilemma is really the heart of the matter. Sally is an unhappy child shuttled from one parent to another; she feels unwelcome with either parent; she wants to go home without knowing where that is. Sallys initial reaction to the voices and creatures inhabiting the sealed-off rooms of the house is wonder not fear. The little fiends play to her weakness ""We want to be your friend"" they coo coaxing her to unseal the ancient ash pit where theyve been captive for a century. Between the music which evokes Bernard Herrmann and the flashing-camera conceit which suggests ""Rear Window"" Mr. Nixey is doing an Alfred Hitchcock homage within a movie lacking anything as subversive or skilled as Hitchcock. Its never explained but Sally carries around a 1970s-era Polaroid replete with bygone flashcubes with which she captures the creatures; a laptop yes would have been cumbersome. The special effects as per any del Toro project are convincing. The motivations less so. During one screening in Manhattan the film reached the point where young Sally has been traumatized for about the fourth time and Alex moans ""I have no idea what do."" ""I do"" someone piped up and the rest of the room erupted in laughs. When an audience is primed to scoff the movie has problems. Those problems include the performance of both Ms. Holmes who never seems to get much traction and young Ms. Madison who is everywhere and for very little reason. Cute sure; convincing no. Circumstance Among those matters generally filed under ""Mutually Exclusive"" are ""sex"" and ""Iranian cinema"" but theres genuine heat emanating from ""Circumstance"" director Maryam Keshavarzs stylish cry of outrage against Irans criminalization of all things youthful music dancing romance--the gateway drugs of intellectual adulthood. There will be complaints that ""Circumstance"" launches its attack on Tehran from a safe distance both culturally and geographically--the New York University-educated Ms. Keshavarz filmed clandestinely in Beirut--but this is not a documentary nor a solely political film Although the circumstances of the story involve theocratic oppression and rampant villainy this is a movie about longing desire desperation and the abandonment of principle--quite a collection of themes all universal. Its also supremely cinematic In her portrayal of the three principals--the privileged Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) the orphaned beauty Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) and Atafehs crackhead-cum-Islamo-fascist brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai)--Ms. Keshavarz uses the mechanics of moviemaking to create interior dialogues and expose the lie of religious fundamentalism. Although there is little that would be deemed explicit by Western standards there is one scene involving nudity and lesbian sex; one assumes it is the fantasy of one of the movies girls-gone-wild until Mehran wakes up and you realize that one persons pleasantly erotic sex dream would likely be a religious zealots screaming nightmare. ""If you could be anywhere in the world"" a voice asks at the beginning of the film ""where would you be?"" Not in present-day Tehran. But a screening of ""Circumstance"" wouldnt be out of the question. --John Anderson contributes film reviews and coverage to a variety of publications. Joe Morgenstern is on vacation. DVD FOCUS ENLARGE Clueless (1995) Perky fashionista Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) thinks her stepbrother Josh (Paul Rudd) is something of an idiot in writer-director Amy Heckerlings Jane Austen-inspired masterpiece of teenage manners. Cher eventually comes around of course and so have audiences ""Clueless"" a major career move for Mr. Rudd has long established itself as one of the more beloved films of the 1990s and one that captures a cultural moment as precisely and hilariously as any American comedy. It also co-stars Dan Hedaya as Chers father who warns her date ""I got a .45 and a shovel and I doubt anybody would miss you."" Control (2007) Sam Rileys breakout performance was as the suicidal Ian Curtis the Rimbaud of postpunk and the guiding spirit of the revered rock band Joy Division. The debut feature of Dutch music-videogapher Anton Corbijn ""Control"" chronicles Curtis relationship with his wife Deborah (Samantha Morton) the creation of Joy Division and his suicide in 1980 at age 23. With the exception of the number that accompanies the closing credits (""Atmosphere"") all Joy Division songs in the film are performed by the actors. Mr. Corbijn used his own EUR4.5 million (6.5 million) to finance the film--and he made his money back. Pans Labyrinth (2006) One of the great films of the past decade this Fascist-era fantasy is Guillermo del Toro at his best Otherworldy hallucinatory but always deeply human. Set five years after the Spanish Civil War ""Pan"" pits a deliriously lovely little girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) against her new stepfather Col. Vidal (Sergi Lopez) a homicidal maniac hunting down rebel holdouts in the hills around his headquarters. Under the sway of faeries Ofelia finds a labyrinth under the house; meets a faun (Doug Jones) who will assign her three tasks; and ultimately discovers her fate. --John Anderson Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

Soon the ever-increasing screen time allotted to the monsters dilutes their fear factor significantly. Carolyn Johns/Miramax Films hide caption toggle caption Carolyn Johns/Miramax Films Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark Director Troy Nixey Genre Horror Running Time 100 minutes Rated R for violence and terror With Guy Pierce Katie Holmes Bailee Madison Jack Thompson Watch Clips Look At The House Look At The House Credit Miramax Films Not Safe Not Safe Credit Miramax Films Set Us Free Set Us Free Credit Miramax Films Haunted house movies are driven by the things that reside in the dark corners both of the house and of our minds. The moody mansion of Dont Be Afraid of the Dark has plenty of those corners and plenty of sharp-toothed beasties that lurk in them. Their target is a withdrawn little girl Sally (Bailee Madison) who has just been sent to live with her father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Homes). Hes an architect shes an interior designer and theyre restoring the old Blackwood mansion in the hopes of getting on the cover of Architectural Digest. But when they open up a hidden basement they accidentally unleash the forces that did in the previous owner and his family decades earlier. These evil little pixies whose odd craving for childrens teeth is explained as a basis for tooth fairy mythology become more and more brazen in their attempts to capture Sally eventually growing into a constant onscreen presence during the latter portion of the film. The films greatest weakness in fact may be that theyre too present. Eventually too little is left to the imagination to do what it does best fill in the gaps with visions far more frightening than anything a filmmaker could put onscreen. Chalk that up to screenwriter and producer Guillermo del Toros fascination with monsters and how he and his design teams can take nightmares and make them concrete and palpable to an audience. That approach worked wonders for a film like del Toros Pans Labyrinth which relies on the believability of an intricate alternate reality a fantasy underworld where elaborate and detailed creatures supported the story. Theres no denying that his latest monsters are imaginative and detailed creations but the haunted house-style story is hampered by his desire to show them off. Del Toro with co-writer Matthew Robbins adapted the story from a 1973 TV horror movie that was a little cheesy highly melodramatic and had a handful of genuinely creepy moments. He brought in first-time director Troy Nixey to take the helm but the film still feels like del Toros through and through from his addition of the little girl who doesnt appear in the original to the monsters of mythical derivation to the heavy dose of fantasy and gorgeous set design that go along with the horror. i Alex (Guy Pearce) the doomed familys patriarch is an architect driven to remodel the most unmarketable mansion on the housing market. Carolyn Johns/Miramax Films hide caption toggle caption Carolyn Johns/Miramax Films Alex (Guy Pearce) the doomed familys patriarch is an architect driven to remodel the most unmarketable mansion on the housing market. Carolyn Johns/Miramax Films These heightened production values and a much more sinister sense of dread throughout are significant improvements on the original without completely abandoning the classical horror tone. Nixey shows a knack for using inky darkness and gloomy shadows to great effect. Its a shame that he undermines that by resorting to cheaper gotcha-style scares too often then lays all of his cards on the table by displaying the creatures so prominently. For storytellers with such obviously keen visual senses theres far too much of an emphasis on telling over showing here. Just as the movie is heading toward what was nearly a truly terrifying climax the action is held up by an inexplicably clunky scene in a library where Kim has been sent by the houses near-death handyman who chooses to use the last words he can muster to send her to the archives instead of confirming her worst fears about the house. Theres little thats less scary than a librarian delivering a too-tidy lecture on the mythological basis of evil yet thats exactly where the movie meanders off at the most inopportune time. The unknown is always the most frightening thing in any great horror movie; the dark is exactly where the things were afraid of have to live. Shining a light on the monsters of this movie literally sends them running; unfortunately the filmmakers also banish the films scares with too much illumination.

Bailee Madison is the girl who hears hissing voices.EnlargeCloseBy Carolyn Johns Miramax FilmsKatie Holmes is the girlfriend of the architect renovating the mansion. Bailee Madison is the girl who hears hissing voices.Sponsored LinksThis insipid wannabe frightener features a checklist of derivative conventions. It all happens in a stately house with creepy creatures lurking within. These gremlin meanies call out in discomfiting whispers offering inane entreaties like ""Lets play.""Psychological thriller stand-bys include an unnervingly serious little girl parents who are too clueless and self-involved to listen to her concerns and a strange old groundskeeper who stares into space and gives cryptic warnings that nobody heeds.VIDEO See the Dont Be Afraid of the Dark trailerPulling a page from the Chucky playbook theres an innocent stuffed animal that becomes a conduit for evil. And like Saw theres brutal ritual sacrifice.The formulaic story is particularly disappointing given that the movie is co-written and ""presented by"" (whatever that means) visionary filmmaker Guillermo del Toro who made Pans Labyrinth an exquisitely original and frightening tale. It seems as if del Toro mostly lent his name to this remake of a 1973 TV movie.About the movieDont Be Afraid of the Dark  out of fourStars Bailee Madison Katie Holmes Guy Pearce Jack Thompson Director Troy Nixey Distributor Miramax Rating R for violence and terror Running time 1 hour 40 minutes Opens Friday nationwideTheres promise in the first few minutes. The opening credits have a distinctive style and the spookily handsome estate in Rhode Island conjures up a palpable sense of the Gothic.The manse is being renovated by architect Alex (Guy Pearce) and his interior designer girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes). Their chemistry is negligible which wouldnt matter if the movie was truly scary. But as is its hard to care about the one-dimensional adults involved.Only slightly more compelling is Alexs young daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) who has been sent by her divorced mother to live with Alex and Kim for reasons that are vague at best. Shes a sad little girl who gobbles fistfuls of pills that her father believes are for attention deficit disorder. But Sally seems able to concentrate pretty well. Especially when it comes to paying close attention to creepy voices and things that go bump in the night.Little Sally goes exploring as children are wont to do. In one day she discovers a basement that was somehow overlooked by adults who spent months renovating the manor.Upon discovery of it the adults unleash a slew of nasty critters who have a hankering for kids teeth and bones. They skitter around like rats and their hairy bodies and wrinkly visages resemble bony rhesus monkeys. When theyre not screaming like banshees theyre whispering raspily like Lord of the Rings Smeagol.""They will forget and others will come"" hiss the menacing voices. The most fear-inducing aspect of the plodding Dont Be Afraid of the Dark is this blatant bid for a sequel. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

It should have been rated PG 13 if you ask me. It wasnt really a true rated R movie. The violence was pretty harsh but the rest of the movie was slow going . marcussaid on Saturday March 03 2012 20433 AMwithout a doubt worst movie Ive seen in a long time. Filled with horror movie cliche this movie pissed me off every step of the way and I want the two hours of my life back for wasting it watching this horrible horrible movie. Honestly hated it... Ramondsaid on Wednesday August 31 2011 83031 PMChris Uh are you high? I mean the movie definitely isnt great and is a dissapointment but far and far away from the worst movie of the year and even Transformers is. Um guessing you didnt have to suffer through movies like The Roommate Season of the Witch Your Highness Country Strong Green Lantern Red Riding Hood and many other garbage movies. Ecksaid on Wednesday August 31 2011 103159 AMBy far the worst movie I have seen this year. It was almost comical rather than scarey. Chrissaid on Monday August 29 2011 111244 PMReally? Are you high? Worst movie right next to Transformers I have seen all year. Nicksaid on Saturday August 27 2011 34314 PMMr Roeper I dont know if you reviewed Insidious earlier this year but if you did see it how did Dont Be Afraid of the Dark compare to it? I thought Insidious was an effectively creepy haunted house movie but was pretty much ruined by its final act. In this review your comments pretty much mirror my thoughts on Insidious (the monsters not being as scary when you see them the explanations being unimpressive). Just curious as to which of the two films you enjoyed more. www.nicksmoviereviews.com - Nick Heathsaid on Saturday August 27 2011 111113 AMThis is why i only get my reviews from you RR. You really hit this one on the head. The only reason i was excited for this was because of Del Toro. But i was pleasently surprised by Katie Holmes. The film was indeed creepy at times but again all roles were the same as every house horror flick. I love seeing Guy Pearce every chance i get but again he was the ""Idiot Father"" witch we see in every house horror flick. Either way was well put together and great acting Keep up the good work RR Greatsaid on Thursday August 25 2011 72238 PMGreat stuff always looking forward to your reviews ) Veannasaid on Saturday August 06 2011 10248 PMHHIS I should have touhhgt of that POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

Shes more focused on being cut off from her architect daddy (Guy Pearce) by his trophy girlfriend (Katie Holmes). Director Troy Nixey lets the atmosphere of the house seep in like rot. And the fact that the whispering creatures feed on human teeth is the ultimate Tooth Fairy nightmare. Yet the film never takes hold emotionally despite strong work from Holmes and young Madison.

And its those places you cant see as a kid -- underneath the bed inside the closet up in the attic -- where the horrible child-eating monsters are always waiting to get you. Put those things together and youve got ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" a goosebump-y haunted-house flick where the floorboards and the mattresses and the big old furnace in the basement really are hiding something deadly. A remake of a fairly-effective TV movie from 1973 -- the monsters were cheap but the suspense was smartly ratcheted -- the new ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" was directed by first-timer Troy Nixey although youd be forgiven for thinking its a new movie from Guillermo del Toro whose name gets the most prominent placement on the posters and in the advertising. Even if del Toro didnt yell ""Action"" and ""Cut"" the movie bears his imprint from his fascination with scary stories told from a childs point-of-view (""The Devils Backbone"") to the elegantly grotesque creatures (which bear more than a resemblance to the creepy-crawlies from ""Pans Labyrinth""). The child in question this time around is Sally (Bailee Madison) an unhappy young girl being shuttled from her unstable mother to go and live with her father Alex (Guy Pearce) whos in the process of restoring a gorgeous old mansion with the help of his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes). Kim does her best to get close to Sally particularly since the work-obsessed Alex doesnt pay much attention to her but Sally resists. And while exploring one day Sally finds a sealed-off room that Alex opens up over the warnings of Harris (Jack Thompson) the houses longtime caretaker. And you can pretty much imagine what happens from there -- beasties get loose Sally hears and eventually sees them no one believes her. But Nixey (working from a script by Del Toro and Matthew Robbins) cranks up the suspense with each appearance of the creatures; as ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" progresses we learn more and more about just what these terrifying imps have in mind and why we should grip our armrest when we see them make off with a pair of scissors. Strong performances anchor the film -- in movies like ""Bridge to Terabithia"" and ""Brothers"" and even in the ludicrous ""Just Go With It"" Madison has proven herself to be an expert at tween gravitas and she nails Sallys fear and hopelessness throughout. Even Holmes gets the pitch of the film just right juggling her initial skepticism about monsters in the house with having stepmom duties suddenly thrown at her. If Pearce registers less than his two co-stars its because the character hes playing is so inert that he cant avoid slipping into the background. If theres one big flaw with ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" its that in 2011 theres only so long that we can watch movie characters face the perils of a haunted house without thinking ""GET OUT ALREADY"" Long after it should be thoroughly obvious to even the most hardened skeptic that something very unnatural is going on in that old mansion Alex insists that they stick around and there arent enough plot demands to make his stubbornness ring true. (As clunky as ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" was at least the script made it clear that the family couldnt afford to move.) But if youre a fan of Guillermo del Toros baroque brand of horror -- theres a disturbing mural here that would fit perfectly into almost any of the Mexican filmmakers movies -- youll find plenty of fun scares and popcorn-box-twisting tension.

The creator of ""Pans Labyrinth"" delivers a horror film that verges on overkill.  |  out of 4 stars By COLIN COVERT August 26 2011 -- 239pm Video (1039)  If youre hankering to see a scary movie film critic Colin Covert says skip this one. Watch to see which fright night movie you should see instead. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Some films fail because they only go halfway. ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" succeeds but it goes too far. If you decide to see it be prepared. As a horror film should be its gruesome tension-filled and you cant tear your eyes from the screen. But its also cruel quite depressing and utterly sad. Written and produced by the masterful Guillermo Del Toro (""Pans Labyrinth"" ""Hellboy"") this is a technically top-quality production and it taps wellsprings of anxiety as chilling as a glacial stream. Theres more to a horror movie than the power to make audiences squirm however. For all its proficient shocks ""Dont Be Afraid"" is emotionally unsatisfying. The tone is oppressive. Since the characters have no light or happy range and dont show a capacity for joy theres little at stake when things go wrong for them. The film directed by Troy Nixey follows young Sally (Bailee Madison) to Blackwood Manor the gothic mansion being restored by her architect father Alex (Guy Pearce) and his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes). This is a bad idea not just because its the spookiest house outside of Haunted Hill. A gruesome prologue showed us the homes deranged first owner luring his maid to the dungeon-like cellar and performing medieval dentistry on the terrified young woman. Worse yet he carried out the atrocity to appease unseen whispering creatures sealed up in the subterranean ash pit. The basement is sealed and forgotten over the generations but as is common in such situations ignoring a foundation problem only makes things worse. The film quickly establishes Sallys emotional vulnerability. Her negligent mother shuttles her off to live with her father who is preoccupied with the ambitious renovation that he hopes will salvage his flagging career. Sally is withdrawn resentful and anxious the modern equivalent of a fairy tale orphan. She has difficulty adapting to her new home and rebuffs Kims awkward efforts to befriend her. Carolyn Johns Miramax Katie Holmes in ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark."" Wandering on her own Sally discovers the long-hidden basement. Soon there are taunting hushed voices in the air vents to Sallys bedroom and Alexs straight razor vanishes from his bathroom medicine chest. There will be blood. Del Toros script is a perplexing mix of intelligence and patchy cliched plotting. It hints at linkages between Sally who feels caged in her lonely new environment and the beastly things scuttling through the ductwork. Alex and Kim dismiss Sallys warnings as childish hysteria and her psychiatrist prescribes strong mood medication despite ample evidence that things are seriously awry. The climax takes a cliffhanger that would have worked in mid-story and makes it an unwieldy unresolved finale. Most of the films power comes from repeated scenes of a child in graphic urgent life-threatening physical danger. Madison performs the grueling scenes with full commitment providing an intensity that is consistent throughout the film and completely believable. Yet the film stumbles in repeatedly creating these borderline abusive situations for the young actress a cheap dramatic effect that will prevent many viewers from engaging with the story. ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" works on a baseline level; it will leave most jaws agape. But while your limbic system responds to its jolts your conscience will take exception.

"Dont Be Afraid of the Dark Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review Dont Be Afraid of the DarkAugust 26 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Katie Holmes left and Bailee Madison in ""Dont Be Afraid of... (Carolyn Johns / Associated...)""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" which puts Guy Pearce Katie Holmes and young Bailee Madison in some serious stomach-churning cant-bear-to-watch-it jeopardy is really truly very scary a| At least until about 30 minutes in when you start to be distracted by the lack of logic in the storytelling and the fact that the nasty little gremlins responsible for all the bumps in the night can be offed pretty easily. Possibly a good sturdy broom would have been enough to clean them out along with the cobwebs in the corners of the Gothic manse where the film is set. The director is Troy Nixey making his feature film debut though you could be forgiven for thinking it is Guillermo del Toro of ""Pans Labyrinth"" acclaim who is completely in charge since his name is splashed all over the ads and the opening credits. Hes the ahem cowriter here (with Matthew Robbins) adapting the script from Nigel McKeands frighteningly original teleplay. The start is properly terrifying due to Nixeys excellent sense of pacing. The story begins about a century or so ago a time of gas lamps and horse-drawn carriages. The place is Blackwood Manor lovely in a foreboding you-will-probably-die-here kind of way. Its owner is a naturalist whose research hints at unnatural forces lurking about. Children tend not to thrive under the estates lofty gables. Flash-forward to present day. Pearce plays Alex a high-end architect desperate to reverse a career slide with a renovation of Blackwood. Holmes is Kim an interior designer and his live-in girlfriend. Madison is Sally Alexs perpetually mournful daughter. Moms shipped her off to stay with her distracted dad basically telling her to buck up any time the kid phones home. Its a tense time and not just because of the strained family relations or the disturbing talking teddy bear Kim gives to Sally. The house is still a major mess. Theres a make-or-break dinner with Architectural Digest looming. Whats more theyve just discovered a door to the creepy basement behind a fake wall and someone keeps whispering through the heating vents ""Salll-yyyyy Salll-yyyy."" (Why a noted architect would not be interested in the very architecturally interesting basement is just one of many lingering questions here.) Soon enough things get worse and not just for Alex Kim and Sally but also for Pearce Holmes and Madison. This is where the creaky narrative with all its missing pieces really gums things up. Its too bad since Nixey rides some moments to electrifying extremes. Director of photography Oliver Stapleton (""The Cider House Rules"") captures all the haunting beauty of Blackwood Manor which production designer Roger Ford (Oscar nominated for his work on ""Babe"") has made so eerie. If only the characters were as well drawn. Pearce the man in the maze of ""Memento"" knows how to work a mind game when hes given one but theres just not enough here for Alex to get lost in. Likewise Madison (""Bridge to Terabithia"") is graced with soulful eyes but her Sally lacks the kind of real heart that might have helped us truly fear for her safety as she gets sucked into all the places where the wild things are. Holmes is there for a little eye candy and a little stepmothering (the good not the evil kind) but frankly shes usually more arresting in celebrity magazines than she is on-screen. And the critters a they are much better before we see them. Once you know what Alex Sally and Kim are up against the fear gives way to boredom then frustration when they dont get the job done. I do hope that ""Dont"" doesnt do Nixey in as he has a real knack for staging high anxiety. For Del Toro the question is what happened? And I dont mean to Sally. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESWord of Mouth Dont Be Afraid of the Dark a team effortAugust 25 2011Guillermo del Toros imagination is working overtimeJune 25 2011MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentKatie HolmesCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-dont-be-afraid-20110826,0,5653384.story",200,don'tbeafraidofthedark15,don'tbeafraidofthedark,latimes

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Dont Be Afraid of the Dark comes with a pedigree of sorts. Its based on a 1973 made-for-TV movie that thoroughly freaked out a generation of teenage baby sitters and 10-year-old boys back in the shag-haircut era; now grown they probably remember it more fondly than they should. The script for the remake is co-written by Guillermo del Toro the Mexican horror-fantasy wunderkind who made ""Pans Labyrinth and the ""Hellboy movies; he produced as well.Even if del Toro had directed though its doubtful hed be able to save ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark from its own inherent limpness. As helmed by first-time director Troy Nixey its an almost generic scare story about a family moving into a mansion with a tribe of boogedy-boo critters in the basement. While there are moments of eldritch atmosphere and a few pro forma jolts nothing here justifies our attention let alone the films inexplicable R rating.Well there is that dental nightmare of an opening scene in which the mansions previous owner goes the extra mile in collecting the creatures favorite snack of human teeth. But once the story line proper kicks in and glowering little Sally (Bailee Madison) moves in with her dad Alex (Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) we wait in vain for the movie to lift off the launching pad.Whatevers hiding down in the ash pit they like the company of little children and their whispered plea to ""come playyy with us Sally is the movies creepiest touch. Dads more interested in restoring the mansion - the production design (Roger Ford) art direction (Lucinda Thomson) and set decoration (Kerrie Brown) are all molderingly grand - and Sally initially snubs the well-intentioned Kim. The primary dramatic arc is watching the neglected tweener and sympathetic sister-figure find common ground.Madison 11 has been knocking around the movies for a few years now surviving the last Adam Sandler farce and giving a tremendously affecting performance as Natalie Portmans daughter in 2009s ""Brothers. This is her first real lead and she rises to it; you just wish there were more to rise to. She conveys Sallys misery and isolation and you understand why shed follow those basement voices wherever they lead. Once the plot mechanics kick in though Sally has nothing to do but shriek and cower.Nor do Pearce and Holmes bring much to the party since he keeps appearing to look offscreen at the movie hed rather be in and she never gets out of scared-rabbit mode. (Has there ever been a less forceful movie star?) ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark stalls for time as it shows more and more of its sharp-fanged little villains but since the movie lacks anything in the way of genuine scares the striptease quickly turns tedious.When we finally do see them theyre spindly stop-motion gremlins very much in the established del Toro style but minus the psycho-mythic impact. Perhaps they didnt pass the auditions for ""Pans Labyrinth and this is their consolation? For the rest of us its a booby prize.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. Follow him on Twitter tyburr.

Slideshow Dont Be Afraid of the Dark Tooth-rattling horror tale Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Dont Be Afraid of the Dark >> Dental professionals may be the only folks to get a kick out of this gothic horror number - a mostly unrewarding remake of a much revered 1973 TV movie. Directed by comic book artist Troy Nixey Dont Be Afraid of the Dark comes with a Guillermo del Toro stamp of facilitation - the Pans Labyrinth Oscar-winner cowrote and coproduced this minor-key scare fare. And on paper there are similarities to the extraordinary Pans Labyrinth Both films involve a traumatized girl thrown into a house where her parent has taken up with a new partner and where menacing creatures pop up out of the floorboards running amok. But Pans Labyrinth had depth and emotion and Ivana Baquero as its young lead atremble with wonder and dread. Dont Be Afraid has Bailee Madison an 11-year-old Hollywood pro with 28 movie and television titles to her credit. She was compelling in Brothers (as Natalie Portmans shaken-up daughter) but here mopey-eyed and quavery-lipped she just oversells everything Her unhappiness at being sent away by her mother to live with her dad (Guy Pearce); her resentment toward Dads new girlfriend (Katie Holmes); her sense of isolation and fear in a cavernous old house where whispering voices seem to be coming out of the basement - a basement that her architect father didnt even know was there. Joltingly graphic and atmospheric (Nixey and his crew at least know how to set up a few good shocks) Dont Be Afraid of the Dark fails to involve us in any meaningful way with its characters. Madisons Sally is a whiner. Pearces Alex is well a whiner (his career hinges on a makeover of this rambling manse and getting it on the cover of Architectural Digest). And Holmes Kim is there to make thankless offerings to her would-be stepdaughter a teddy bear a brooch scones. There are fairies in this putatively scary tale and when we finally get a good look at them - scurrying fur balls with the mugs of demons - they are not a pretty sight. This is a SPOILER alert but it should be noted that these pesky critters are tooth fairies. Message to moviegoers Floss floss floss.

(Carolyn Johns/AP) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday August 25 2011 320 PM Title Dont Be Afraid of the Dark An architect moves his family into a haunted house. With Guy Pearce Katie Holmes. Director Troy Nixon (149). R violence and terror.It was understandable in the Seventies that people might be genuinely shocked to find their once-abandoned dream home hid a haunted history. These days though buyers really ought to do a little research before hiring the moving vans.Then again youre probably not averse to some suspension of disbelief if youre going to see ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" Troy Nixeys enjoyably spooky remake of a 1973 television movie.While anyone in their right mind would abandon Blackwood Manor the minute the groundskeeper turns up dead Alex (Guy Pearce) and Kim (Katie Holmes) have too much invested to simply walk away. Hes an architect shes an interior designer and theyve fixed up this crumbling Rhode Island mansion in hopes of landing the cover of ""Architectural Digest.""Unfortunately the gremlins in the basement have other ambitions--chief among them to consume Alexs nine-year-old daughter Sally (Bailee Madison). Once Sally starts screaming in the night Kim wisely suggests they decamp to a hotel. But that wouldnt be any fun for us so Alex insists they stay put until it becomes too late to leave.If you flinch at ""boo"" youll find plenty to jump at here. Just dont expect striking originality or even genuinely memorable eeriness. Still every time ""Dark"" starts to feel like a generic thriller its saved by the distinctive stamp of co-screenwriter/producer Guillermo del Toro (""Hellboy"" ""Pans Labyrinth"").Del Toros influence is visible throughout from the ghoulish sight of tiny scrambling creatures to the psychological web that entangles all the houses residents. (Kims role as stepmother could inspire a grad-school thesis in itself.)Holmes tries harder than Pearce who seems to feel this movie is not worthy of his best efforts. But the real standout is Madison who invests Sallys terror with a heartbreaking fear borne not of monsters but parental cruelty. No one understands better than del Toro that the gravest horrors arent imagined by children but created by adults.

Comments click to enlarge Dont Be Afraid of the Dark Rated R  100 minutes  2011 A little girl (Bailee Madison) sent to live with her father (Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend (Katie Holmes) in an old dark house discovers that the basement is inhabited by murderous little creatures visible only to her. Writer-producer Guillermo Del Toro based this lush creepy tale on an American TV movie that scared the dickens out of him when he was nine. The remake plays like a shallower more cliched variation on his masterpiece Pans Labyrinth but its mix of gory effects and deliciously old-fashioned visuals make for a classy scary horror show. Comic artist Troy Nixey directed though Del Toros influence is evident in the genial violence and the juxtaposing of children and terror.

"Dont Be Afraid of the Dark review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Dont Be Afraid of the Dark Scariest? Maybe notDel Toros script for remake falls short of his childhood memories -- 2 starsAugust 26 2011|Michael Phillips | Movie criticWhen fantasy filmmaker Guillermo del Toro says he considers the 1973 made-for-TV movie ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" the scariest thing ever made for the medium hes not really talking about the teleplay itself.Hes remembering fondly his own preteen susceptibility -- what it was like to be a freaked-out kid watching a moderately well-made cleverly suggestive haunted-house thriller (with goblins).I felt the same way the year before when ""The Night Stalker"" aired or watching another made-for-TV scare picture from 72 ""Gargoyles"" with Cornel Wilde Jennifer Salt and Bernie Casey as the chief gargoyle. Memories -- especially boomer memories -- of what frightened us on TV as kids and what might be worth a remake are no less or more reliable than anyone elses.Del Toro may have misjudged the source material in remaking ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" for a theatrical release a new century an R rating and a realigned narrative. Theres a good horror film to be gotten again out of that material. But this ones fairly good at best.Filmed in and around Melbourne Australia (standing in for somewhere in the eastern U.S.) were back in the mansion containing nasty little homunculi in the sub-basement region though theyre bold enough to venture upstairs now and then. Guy Pearce plays a preoccupied architect renovating the house; Katie Holmes is his girlfriend. A key character has been added for the remake the architects daughter played by Bailee Madison. This unhappy girl adjusting to her divorced parents new lives hears the whispered hissing invitations of the monsters when no one else can. As in del Toros widely admired ""Pans Labyrinth"" the young girl must navigate her way to safety while convincing her elders that shes not vindictive a liar or losing her mind.Directed dutifully by first-time feature filmmaker Troy Nixey the script adaptation by del Toro and Matthew Robbins develops a mythology about why the goblins are grabbing humans and their teeth through the centuries. The atmosphere of ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" never rests for a second; straddling both the 73 film and a modern update some details remain old school (a Polaroid camera plays a key role) others are new. To my taste theres too much of everything. The soundtrack never shuts up with the wind the murmurings the shudderings. And while director Nixey has talent his indiscriminately roving camera tends to diffuse the tension not heighten it.Also the human element goes wanting. Pearce in particular is not helped by his role as one of the more clueless dolts in the history of parenthood. All in all in a different key I prefer the remake of ""Fright Night.""mjphillipstribune.comDont Be Afraid of the Dark -- 2 starsMPAA rating R (for violence and terror)Cast Guy Pearce (Alex Hurst); Katie Holmes (Kim); Bailee Madison (Sally); Jack Thompson (Harris); Julia Blake (Mrs. Underhill)Credits Directed by Troy Nixey; written by Guillermo del Toro and Matthew Robbins based on the 1973 teleplay by Nigel McKeand; produced by Guillermo del Toro and Mark Johnson.

Dont Be Afraid of the Dark Fair Director Troy Nixey. Cast Katie Holmes Guy Pearce Bailee Madison. Rating R for violence and terror. This weeks new movie releases The fabulously creative Guillermo del Toro co-wrote the screenplay based on the 1973 television movie of the same name which he says scared him so bad when he saw it as a child it inspired him to delve into horror as a career choice. Interview Guillermo del Toro Alas although del Toros presence can be felt in the nicely creepy atmosphere and some of the young-child-in-crisis plot line he introduces he did not direct instead giving that job to Troy Nixey. What might have been well never know but the tension built up through the first part of the movie leads to a disappointing payoff. The film begins with a prologue set at the morbid-looking Blackwood Manor in which we learn a little of the horrors to come. Strange not-quite-human voices coming from a furnace grate a man clearly driven insane and . . . a lack of teeth. Its all quite disturbing and gives way to the present when the furnace grate has been bolted shut and the basement room in which all this took place sealed shut. Blackwood Manor is being restored by architect Alex (Guy Pearce) along with his girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes). Hes counting on making the cover of Architectural Digest to give a boost to his sagging career. But then his daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) arrives sent like an unwanted puppy by her mother. Shes confused doesnt want to be there; Alex is too busy to pay attention to her and she resents Kim. In other words she has plenty of reasons to let her imagination run wild. Soon she is hearing those strange voices and before long stumbles upon the sealed-up basement room - and the furnace with the bolted-shut grate. It wont stay that way for long. To this point Nixey does a nice job of creating a weird menacing world. Jack Thompson as Harris a handyman who seems to know more than he lets on contributes to the dread. Something bad is bound to happen. And it does. Nixey shows us the little monsters. Or creatures. Or more accurately the homunculi the things waiting behind the grate. Horror storytellers have finally realized that revealing the monster bit by bit making the audience wait is much more effective and scarier than just trotting them out at the start. But once we see them they need to be scary. The more we see of Nixeys monsters the less scary they get. Remember Kiwi shoe polish? And the little kiwi on the cover of the can? The creatures here basically look like evil versions of that. They start causing all kinds of trouble for which everyone blames Sally until its too late. But Kim starts to suspect something is up and the two bond in part over Alexs stubborn refusal to see that something is amiss. Poor Pierce usually excellent isnt given much more to do than that - doubt Sally. Holmes is serviceable. Only Madison really shines until she too falls victim to a story that doesnt hold together. (Nor do its details. In one scene a creatures arm gets chopped off. Its lying there on the floor in a room with a crowd of people. And we never see nor hear another thing about it.) Theres too much of that too many threads that dont come together. ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" offers a few scares along the way but after a promising build-up what it delivers ultimately is disappointment.

"Dont Be Afraid of the Dark | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; don-t-be-afraid-of-the-dark ) Dont Be Afraid of the Dark (United States/Australia/Mexico 2010) August 25 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Dont Be Afraid of the Dark a re-make of the 1973 made-for-TV movie of the same name is a haunted house movie whose success lies in the careful manner freshman director Troy Nixey steeps everything in a surfeit of atmosphere. It overflows. It suffuses every frame. It seeps off the screen and into the auditorium. Dont Be Afraid of the Dark needs no ""boo"" moments; its harrowing approach makes the production one long exercise in building tension. The movie is deliciously creepy even if it does exhibit some issues that keep it from being a top-notch example of ""things that go bump in the night"" horror. The movie opens with a scene set in the 1800s then quickly flashes forward to the present day. Unmarried couple Alex (Guy Pearce) and Kim (Katie Holmes) are welcoming Alexs young daughter Sally (Bailee Madison) to the New England mansion they are renovating. Sally a lonely and possibly clinically depressed girl is less-than-thrilled about the shock to her life that forces her to spend her days in a gloomy old house with a workaholic father. Her explorations of the grounds uncover a hidden cellar. The taciturn caretaker (Jack Thompson) urges the current owners to keep it sealed. However excited by the discovery Alex opens up the room and Sally is drawn to the musty dusty dimly-lit place. But this is not some benign underground chamber - there are tiny creatures that live behind the vent to an ash pit and when Sally inadvertently releases them she becomes stalked and terrorized by the monsters she has freed. The weakest aspect of Dont Be Afraid of the Dark is the storyline which is riddled with holes and implausibilities. This shouldnt come as a surprise however. Even the best horror films tend to suffer from narrative-related problems. They rely on visceral elements to distract the audience. Indeed in this case the viewers attention is so arrested by the palpable sense of dread that its easy to overlook many of the most head-scratching questions not the least of which is why Kim is still using a Polaroid Instamatic (and where she buys the film). Nigel McKeands teleplay may have been spruced up for the 2010s but little genuine ""updating"" has been done. The filmmakers might have been better off making this a period piece rather than attempting to convince us its taking place in todays tech-savvy world. Dont Be Afraid of the Dark has a slow deliberate pace which may annoy viewers weaned on the faster more brutal genre standouts of the slasher generation. Thats not to say there isnt gore but its carefully targeted and not overused. That gives it impact. The biggest departure from the original relates to the age of the female protagonist. In the 1973 version Sally was an adult. Here shes a girl. The ""child in danger"" scenario is hated by some because of the way in which it manipulates emotions. But theres no denying that it raises the stakes. Its also worth noting that Guillermo del Toro who co-wrote the new screenplay has an affinity for telling stories through the eyes of a young female protagonist - the movie occasionally echoes Pans Labyrinth in terms not only of perspective but of content. Theres also an odd connection to Gremlins when it comes to how the creatures are crafted and portrayed. Neither Guy Pearce nor Katie Holmes has a lot to do beyond filling ritual stereotypes - the distracted father and the potential stepmother who seeks to bond with her reluctant future daughter. The lions share of the films real acting goes to 11-year old Bailee Madison who is more than equal to the task. Madisons filmography lists an impressive number of credits for one so young but this is her first bona fide starring role and its hard to argue against her casting. She is compelling and we find ourselves rooting for Sally. The coupling of Madisons lonely frightened performance with the weighty sense of atmosphere developed by Nixey and cinematographer Oliver Stapleton provides Dont Be Afraid of the Dark with all the ammunition it needs. This is a flawed yet haunting motion picture whose forceful sense of creepiness is difficult to shake.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet A polish on a fondly remembered 1973 TV movie Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark has been promoted as ""Guillermo Del Toros Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark"" which by the evidence here is both unmistakable and deceptive. Del Toro co-wrote the script (with Matthew Robbins) and served as a producer and there are distinct echoes of past work like Pans Labyrinth and The Devils Backbone in its childs-eye-view of a scary fantastical universe. Yet strong direction tends to be the make-or-break element of haunted-house movies like this one. Really its the atmosphere that changes; the stories are more or less the same. Here those duties fall to Troy Nixey a comics illustrator making his feature debut. And though Nixey carries it across with some style some intensity and some graphic imagination the whole isnt quite the sum of its somes. After a nasty little prologue promises a more sinister take on the genre Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark settles into a relatively straightforward haunted-house scenario with flashes of Spielbergian whimsy. Bailee Madison plays the child in peril a 9-year-old daughter of divorce whos sent to live with her father Guy Pearce and his new girlfriend Katie Holmes. Pearce and Holmes have invested their savings and lives in restoring a creepy old manor to its former glory but an ancient evil threatens to keep it off the pages of Architectural Digest. After discovering a walled-up basement Madison begins hearing voices beckoning her from the furnace but the cute little monsters behind the grate turn out to be less friendly once theyre unleashed. The beasties in Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark have the horror-comic malleability of the creatures in Gremlins Adorable and funny on one beat nasty the next. (Theyre as temperamental as a mogwai too with an extreme sensitivity to light and a specific appetite for human teeth.) Nixey pulls off one terrifically frightening sequence when Madison hides under a bed sheet that keeps peeling back into darkness but he mostly leads the film through the expected paces. Absent any qualities beyond the surface like the history and politics that trouble Del Toros best films Dont Be Afraid Of The Dark is little better than a half-decent scare machine.

(The spirits must sit around watching Saw sequels.) I cant say that I totally enjoyed this sequence but it did seem a harbinger of a sickly effective shocker; so did the fact that fantasy/horror maestro Guillermo del Toro (Pans Labyrinth) is the films producer and co-writer. But Dont Be Afraid of the Dark is neither colorfully brutal nor especially fun. Its a plodding derivative gothic potboiler The Shining meets Coraline with a touch of Gremlins played (boringly) straight. Decades after that prelude a young girl very serious Sally (Bailee Madison) comes to the manor house to live with her father (Guy Pearce) an architect who is renovating the place and his girlfriend (Katie Holmes) whos assisting him in attempting to land their dream of an Architectural Digest cover. Pearce and Holmes often fine performers here stoop to the kind of Amityville Horror acting in which every line gets highlighted and overstated. (And why is Pearce wearing a scruffy dark brush cut that looks like a wig?) Of course its the kind of cheesy acting you can forgive when a horror film delivers but Dont Be Afraid of the Dark grows less suspenseful as it goes on. The spirits heralded by echoey whispers (""Sall-eee Now youll see what its like down here"") are a small scurrying army of 10-inch-tall humpbacked simian beasties who look like they came out of a CGI demo reel. Theres no mystery to them which may be why theres no fear. C?

Scary movies can get away with breaking promises to their audience. They can resurrect exhausted cliches (creepy old houses packed with things bumping in the night) and they can even toss in stale character archetypes (the clueless father the precocious child who sees things adults dont). But one crime even the best horror cant get away with is presenting characters so stupid that we lose all interest in whether they live or die. Which is the heart of Dont Be Afraid of the Dark. This film was completed in 2010 and sat on a Miramax shelf for a year (never a good sign). Now its being billed as ""presented by"" Guillermo del Toro the monster-film virtuoso who won mainstream glory with Pans Labyrinth. This marketing tactic has a clear goal to convince people that this film is something more than a cauldron of stewed garbage. Yes Mr. Del Toro did co-write and co-produce this fiasco. But those of us who love him refuse to believe his involvement was much more than a little creative direction and a few rubber stamps. The story starts off tepid graduates into dull and then careens into sheer idiocy nine-year-old Sally (an appropriately cute and somber Bailee Madison) is sent by her neglectful mother to live with her father (Guy Pearce a magnetic actor who phones in every line of this movie) and his textbook postdivorce girlfriend (who else but Katie Holmes?). Of course they cant live in just any house--theyre inhabiting and restoring Blackwood Manor a gothic mansion in Rhode Island filled with secret rooms shadowy corners and macabre history. As soon as Sally arrives the night-bumping commences the hellish beasties eventually emerge and their cartel proceeds to torment poor the child while the adults ignore her screams and chalk up her behavior to ""excessive nerves."" This plot formula is used more than a Port Authority restroom for a reason it works. The ""precocious child sees what the blind adults cant"" premise can be deeply powerful and terrifying. But it works only if the child is truly precocious and if the adults are in any way likeable/relatable. Here we have Sally (since when do modern parents name their babies Sally?) displaying a total lack of self-preservation in the face of ominous voices coming from a basement sewer--she goes so far as to steal a box of tools to remove metal bolts from a grate to set them free (since 9-year-olds have an in-depth knowledge of tools not to mention the strength of a linebacker). Meanwhile every adult seems afflicted with a severe case of numbskullery--a man emerges from the basement with scissors plunged into his neck and all the housekeeper can do is stare while the accepted remedy for Sallys terrified screams is ""Oh I just put her to bed."" Dont even get me started on Katie Holmes. On the plus side the movie looks gorgeous--everything Mr. Del Toro touches looks a little like Pans Labyrinth with its magical realism and canorous sense of the natural world. No one else can anthropomorphize a set of hedges or a library to the point of menacing beauty. The mansion is magnificent the raison detre of the film--every detail is sumptuous and shot with elegant classicism. Even the creatures look impressive with their skeletal faces and Skeksis posture. With so much visual beef to work with director Troy Nixey manages a few genuine creep-you-out moments. But mostly he relies on a single fallback to bring the scare Sally screaming. In the best horror child screams are reserved for moments of extreme suspense and foreboding--think Tommy Doyle in Halloween or Carol Anne Freeling in Poltergeist. Overuse the kid scream and you go from razor-sharp tension to ""Where are my %amp;ing earplugs??"" Here we get a 9-year-old screaming incessantly for 60 minutes while her parents do nothing--its like being trapped in a suburban Chuck E. Cheese. This whole debacle is a shame--after announcing he was no longer directing The Hobbit Mr. Del Toro sustained a blow to his post-Pans Labyrinth armor and this washout brings him one step closer to full career rupture. It just goes to show no matter how burnished your backdrop or splendiferous your setting if your script is crap youre stuck with a total dud. editorialobserver.com DONT BE AFRAID OF THE DARK Running time 100 minutes Written by Guillermo del Toro and Matthew Robbins Directed by Troy Nixey Starring Guy Pearce Katie Holmes Bailee Madison 1.5/4 Comment Filed under Guillermo del Toro Guy Pearce Horror Katie Holmes Matthew Robbins movie movie reviews Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/08/dont-be-afraid-of-anything-but-this-terrible-movie/,200,don'tbeafraidofthedark28,don'tbeafraidofthedark,observer

Which may be why Pans Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro was inspired to co-produce and write (with Matthew Robbins) a remake of the legendarily creepy 1973 TV-movie Dont Be Afraid of the Dark which del Toro reportedly saw at age nine (and this reviewer at age 10). In this visually lush updating directed by newcomer Troy Nixey nine-year-old Sally (Bailee Madison) is sent by her mother to live with her architect father (Guy Pearce) and his interior-decorator girlfriend (Katie Holmes) in an old Rhode Island mansion theyre restoring. In a flash Sally is compelled by whispery voices to open up a firmly bolted fireplace ash pit--big mistake--thereby setting free small demonic creatures that feed on the teeth of dead children a trait that is a nicely nasty new touch (the TV-movie was vague about their motivations beyond ordinary demon meanness). Just because they can the creatures begin taunting and frightening Sally who puts up a good fight. If the grand finale isnt as resonantly scary as the originals maybe thats just because try though we might were no longer impressionable kids.

Its been nearly 40 years since the shockingly scary TV movie ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" terrified a 9-year-old Guillermo del Toro who would make a career recycling what thrilled him as a kid into classy highbrow horror pics. Pairing a sinister old house with the sort of creatures that haunt ones dreams the 1973 telepic inspired del Toros first outright remake  --  a suspenseful yet markedly less insidious update he penned with writing partner Matthew Robbins and handed off to comicbook vet Troy Nixey to direct. Del Toros name should entice more than just genre auds to this Miramax orphan since adopted by FilmDistrict for an Aug. 26 release. During the decades ""Dark"" spent festering in his imagination del Toro had plenty of opportunity to embellish the pics meager plot which centers on a woman named Sally who unseals a heavy grate in the basement fireplace only to release a bunch of darkness-dwelling creatures. In del Toros version Sally is a 9-year-old girl dragged into a supernatural situation beyond her grasp not unlike the protagonists of ""The Devils Backbone"" or ""Pans Labyrinth."" After an unsettling prologue demonstrates that Blackwood Manor is not at all a safe place to raise children ""Dark"" warily observes the arrival of young Sally (Bailee Madison ""Brothers"") to the creepy run-down estate where her architect father (an unusually dull Guy Pearce) and his much-younger girlfriend (Katie Holmes) have been doing extensive restoration. More than a century earlier Emerson Blackwood and his son mysteriously disappeared inside the house and though theyve left the premises blessedly ghost-free the monsters that snatched them are still lurking in the darkest recesses of the basement furnace. From the beginning the screenplay gives audiences an advantage over the characters who are all oblivious to Blackwoods dark history --  all except the groundskeeper Mr. Harris (Jack Thompson) who has made some sort of secret pact with the creatures (one of several direct nods to the original that makes no sense in the storys newly expanded context). Ominous cutaways reveal that Sallys arrival has awakened the monsters in the basement who wont be satisfied until theyve feasted on childrens teeth. Working closely with del Toro Nixey instinctively understands the tension will be greatest if he withholds the creatures at first relying instead on the shadowy figures teasing whispers to establish their menacing intentions. Once it comes time to reveal the ugly buggers Nixey prolongs the suspense by doing so in pieces showing glistening eyes behind the basement grate crab-like claws as they scuttle through the air ducts and finally the nightmarish alien faces dreamt up by horror-surrealist Chet Zar. So why arent they frightening? Whereas the telepic wheedled its way into ones subconscious by suggesting that malicious homunculi might be conspiring to kill people after the lights go out del Toros creatures are complicated by a more robust mythology. Still the guidelines are far from clear If the rule is ""one life must be taken"" then why dont they take a life already rather than wasting time harassing everybody? And what effect does light have on these photosensitive monsters exactly? In perhaps the most curious divergence from the ruthlessly efficient subplot-free original del Toro and Robbins script tries to tie these urchins to the tooth-fairy tradition which just feels silly. Far more effective is the addition of the uneasy dynamic between young Sally and her stepmother-to-be with these two rivals becoming allies when confronted with the supernatural (strangely Madison looks more genetically similar to Holmes than Pearce). The part of Sally calls for an exceptional young actress and Madison -- Drew Barrymore-cute but nobodys angel -- not only aces the roles emotional demands but also brings an unexpectedly dark undertone to the character. No less important is the Australian house that serves as Blackwood Manor carefully appointed to evoke the Victorian settings seen in classic horror movies while still supplying a wholly original location. Thanks primarily to a predictably sharp combination of lensing editing and suspense music ""Dont Be Afraid of the Dark"" succeeds in stinging the audience with a few shock scares including a terrifying sequence in which one of the creatures manages to creep under Sallys bedcovers. Still rather than trying to frighten adults this entire R-rated exercise feels engineered to emotionally scar any younger auds who should happen to see it --  much as the original did del Toro back in the day.
