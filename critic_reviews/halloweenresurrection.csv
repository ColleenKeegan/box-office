Photo HANDOUT Curtis Resurrection so cheesy its scary / Actors latest stab at horror franchise is a sad sad sight 1 / 1 Back to Gallery HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION Horror. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. Directed by Rick Rosenthal. Written by Larry Brand. (R. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Jamie Lee Curtis cant make up her mind. On the one hand shes a childrens book writer and a cheerful advocate for adoption. On the other hand shes grabbing butcher knives and slogging through yet another sequel to ""Halloween"" the 1978 thriller that made her famous. Aside from the bizarre disconnect between the two halves -- and the ethical void they represent -- Curtis is truly working our nerves with her appearance in ""Halloween Resurrection"" a cheesy thing that opened Friday without any advance screening. Twenty-four years down the road middle-aged and apparently a slave to her mortgage Curtis is still running hysterically down hallways from her screen brother the masked serial killer Michael Myers. Its a sad sight and it makes a person want to sit down have a heart-to- heart and say ""Jamie Lee do you see Sally Field wearing her Flying Nun habit these days? Does Robin Williams show up in Mork and Mindy -- Na-Nus For a New Millennium? ""Unh-uh girl. John Travolta isnt making Saturday Night Fever Off the Thermometer Jessica Lange isnt paying the bills with King Kong sequels and Jane Fonda isnt Barbarella Drawing Social Security and Loving It "" Curtis also starred in ""Halloween H20 Twenty Years Later"" a project she generated God knows why. She dies in the first 20 minutes of ""Resurrection"" which is the eighth movie in the series but the stain and the shame are still there. Once shes dispatched we shift to a college campus where a sextet of airheads gets hired to spend one night in Michaels former home. Busta Rhymes plays the huckster who broadcasts their adventure live on the Internet and outfits them with headset cameras. Shades of ""Blair Witch Project"" a little ""Real World"" and ""Survivor"" tossed in. Plus slaughter decapitation and crucifixion when Michael shows up and starts the death count. Id never seen a ""Halloween"" movie prior to this -- call me lucky -- so Im wondering if Michaels mask has changed over the years. At this stage it looks like a chalky middle-aged David Cassidy so does that mean it looked like perky postadolescent David Cassidy in the first installments? Later in the movie when Michael gets scorched in a fire and his mask melts and warps along the edges it starts looking like the most recent manifestation of Michael Jackson. Now thats scary. . This movie contains raw language and extreme violence.

Its now the center of the dot-com universe where a canny African-American entrepreneur Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) and his techie girlfriend (Tyra Banks) have set up shop as ""www.dangertainment.com."" The concept to wire half a dozen teenagers with tiny video cameras and send them out to spend Halloween night in the house where Michael Myers (Brad Loree) the unstoppable psychotic killer who is the seriess single enduring character spent his unhappy childhood and claimed his older sister as his first victim. Net surfers all over the globe will be able to tune in and follow the action choosing which teenager they wish to follow through the sites interactive menu. Mr. Carpenter having wisely bailed out of the series after the initial entry the producers have turned to Rick Rosenthal who directed ""Halloween II"" back in 1981 to film this eighth installment in the apparently never-ending saga. He does what he can but there arent many opportunities for invention left in the played-out formula. Almost as if ""Scream"" and its ironic self-conscious sequels didnt exist Mr. Rosenthal and his writers Larry Brand and Sean Hood stay slavishly close to the iron-clad rules of the teen slasher genre. Of the six teenagers chosen all students at a local college only one Sara Moyer (Bianca Kajlich) has the virginal qualities necessary to survive the genres punishing puritanical rituals. Unlike Jen (Katee Sackhoff) a buxom blonde who hopes her Internet exposure will land her a network television job or Donna (Daisy McCrackin) a redheaded critical studies major who quotes Sartre at moments of ecstasy the sensibly brown-haired Sara is not tempted by hunky boys or illicit drugs. Shes a straight arrow just like her long-ago predecessor Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) the plucky baby sitter of the first film. With multiple points of view built into the premise Mr. Rosenthal at first seems to be working a grisly variation on the split-screen techniques of Mike Figgiss ""Timecode"" (2000) but he quickly and inexplicably lets that idea drop. Instead the action turns to conventionally shot piercings and dismemberments as Michael whos been secretly living in the basement all these years hacks away at his unwelcome guests. (They are after all committing criminal trespass.) Spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen not screaming but yawning. Ms. Curtis who became a star thanks to Mr. Carpenters film has been lured back for a cameo appearance as Laurie last seen grappling with Michael in ""Halloween H20"" (1998). She deserves better particularly after her nice work in last years underrated ""Tailor of Panama."" ""Halloween Resurrection"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for its scenes of chocolate-sauce violence recreational drug use and brief nudity. HALLOWEEN Resurrection Directed by Rick Rosenthal; written by Larry Brand and Sean Hood based on a story by Mr. Brand that is based on characters created by Debra Hill and John Carpenter; director of photography David Geddes; edited by Robert A. Ferretti; music by Danny Lux with ""Halloween"" theme by Mr. Carpenter; production designer Troy Hansen; produced by Paul Freeman; released by Dimension Films. Running time 89 minutes. This film is rated R. WITH Busta Rhymes (Freddie Harris) Bianca Kajlich (Sara Moyer) Thomas Ian Nicholas (Bill) Ryan Merriman (Myles Barton) Sean Patrick Thomas (Rudy) Tyra Banks (Nora) and Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode).

What can you say about Halloween Resurrection a horror sequel thats maladroit enough to be a self-conscious ripoff of...""Blair Witch 2""? A bedraggled-looking Jamie Lee Curtis makes a token appearance during the prelude after which a handful of college students spend a night searching for clues in the original ""Halloween"" house which has been rigged with video surveillance cameras that broadcast their couplings and dispatchings live on the Internet. As visions of fear go the grainy electromagnetic images of the usual stabbings feel very three years ago. Busta Rhymes as the cyber-filmmaker in charge of the proceedings keeps smirking about the art of ""dangertainment."" ""Halloween Resurrection"" comes closer to comatainment.
