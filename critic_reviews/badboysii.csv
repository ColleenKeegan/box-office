But throw in a cops partner neck-deep in New Age anger-management some platinum-dreadlocked Haitians and a Cuban drug lord who cuts people up and puts them in tortilla bins. Also add enough gunfire to overthrow a small country and you have a sequel that is well certainly louder than the original. In this Michael Baydirected head-pounding car-wrecking follow-up to Jerry Bruckheimers 1995 ""Bad Boys"" Mr. Smith is Mike Lowrey a Miami narcotics detective and member of a task force assigned to get a grip on the soaring Ecstasy business fueling the citys hopped-up nightlife. His partner Marcus (Martin Lawrence) is a whiny middle-aged cop battling an identity crisis and the ambitions of his little sister (Gabrielle Union) a fresh-minted undercover DEA lovely assigned to the same case. After two hours of splattered brains and smart-aleck repartee its hard to remember how the trouble started. The movie begins somewhere in the waters off Miami where some heavily accented glassy-eyed smugglers are executing an intricate drug shipment delivery involving speed boats and scuba divers. Our two sleuths naturally are onto the operation but to the chagrin of their polo-shirted chief they are responsible for one too many massive explosions on the evening news. The fault it turns out lies with bad tips from a snitch. Complicating matters is Marcuss little sister who is not just undercover for the DEA -- shes also the undercover dating interest of Detective Lowrey. Delivering an action-packed flick that also has enough energy to spoof itself is a tall order -- especially given the films evident need to assault the audience visually at every turn. There are plenty of slow-motion shots of Mr. Smith falling shooting with both pistols and bad guys getting splattered in the hereafter. Some of the scenes are hilarious -- intentionally. Dont duck out for popcorn during the self-help session at a video store between Messrs. Smith and Lawrence. More laughs are to be had when Mr. Lawrence accidentally ingests a couple tabs of E. For most of the film however the laugh lines take gallows humor even beyond Hollywoods boundaries of taste. Among the milder examples we can count Mr. Smiths grotesque conversation with a corpse and the arrival on the scene of the drug lords elderly mother immediately after an execution. Mr. Smith has genuine screen charisma and his chemistry with Mr. Lawrence is fun and funny to watch. Fans of the genre will appreciate the expensive automobiles turned to Swiss cheese and bad guys in bad suits. But like our two loose cannons with badges the movie misses its target at least as often as it hits it. Along the way as well it will likely batter a few brain cells into a premature grave. Taking the concept of action-hero spoof to its hilarious extreme this week is ""Johnny English"" featuring British comedian Rowan Atkinson best-known as Mr. Bean. The bloody-mary -- ""not too spicy"" -- drinking secret agent is the un-Bond dispatched to foil a nefarious Frenchie (John Malkovich) who is plotting to steal the throne and turn England into a prison. Agent English was not of course the first choice for the super-secret assignment. By a freak accident he and his relatively competent subordinate (played by an agile Ben Miller) are put on the case. They also get all the attendant perks -- cool gadgets hot cars woman in dangerous spike heels. English unfortunately knows how to work exactly none of them but that doesnt stop him from throwing himself into the job. ""Johnny English"" isnt high or even middling satire. Mr. Atkinsons comedic skills run roughly along the lines of Jim Carreys He falls down well and mugs a lot. During his first outing -- a cocktail party -- English livens things up by feeling up the draperies beating up an imaginary intruder and insulting his host. The mishaps continue on roughly the same trajectory throughout the film. Agent English parachutes into the wrong building accidentally eats sea urchin and confuses a truth serum with a muscle relaxant when administering it to the bad guys. The movie is at times funny enough to make you cry and when its not it moves nicely as a parody -- the kind that also serves as a reminder of what his life would be like if James Bond were as klutzy as the rest of us (only more so). Mr. Atkinson may not be well-known to most Americans yet but his brand of slapstick and tie-in-the-soup social comedy gets a fine introduction here. Dirty Pretty Things ""Dirty Pretty Things"" the new movie by director Stephen Frears is a story about dreams and choices. Set in London the film follows the lives of two young immigrants one from Turkey and the other from Africa as they work together in the Baltic Hotel while hiding from the immigration police. Senay (portrayed by Audrey Tautou) a serene young Muslim beauty who works as a maid in the hotel lives for the day when she will escape to New York ""where they put lights in the trees in the winter and some of the policemen ride white horses. Not all but some."" Her life becomes more complicated when she rents her couch to Okwe (Chiweter Ejiofor) who works the night shift at the front desk -- and so do her dreams. Its soon clear why the movie is being marketed as a thriller. Theres a dark secret in the hotel which Okwe stumbles upon when he enters the bathroom of room 510. The hotel manager it seems is engaged in the darkest of criminal pursuits and along the way enriching himself selling black-market passports. The thriller aspect of this work happily doesnt overshadow its real beauty -- its stark portrayal of the nightmare despair of aliens hunted on edge prepared to risk all for a new start. Garage Days ""Garage Days"" a new Australian film by director Alex Proyas (""The Crow"") is what MTVs ""The Real World"" would be like if its characters admitted they were simply aspiring actors. ""Garage Days"" is more clever more compelling and genuine. The story follows the rock-star aspirations of a motley crew of young musicians as they struggle to book gigs and stalk a hot music manager they just know could be their ticket to stardom. On the way they flirt with each other wear fishnet stockings and ripped T-shirts and live as though adulthood was still a long way off. The film has the kind of semi-deranged atmosphere that brought acclaim to films like ""Trainspotting"" -- which it doesnt resemble in any other way. It succeeds mainly because of an admirable young cast and a director who knew how to extract hilarity from these post-adolescent adventures.

(c)Columbia Pictures By David Germain AP Movie Writer Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay know theyre going to get lousy reviews. Were happy to oblige them not only for the damage ""Bad Boys II has done to our eardrums but also because theyve made a truly abominable movie. Producer Bruckheimer and director Bay have sunk to a new low for irresponsible inhuman violence dragging Will Smith and Martin Lawrence along for a ghastly deafening display of bloodshed. It took the filmmakers eight years to follow up on the 1995 buddy-cop flick ""Bad Boys"" a solid but unspectacular box-office success that established TV stars Smith and Lawrence on the big screen. Bay and Bruckheimer make up for lost time by padding the sequel to an excruciating 21/2-hour tempest of outlandish gunplay explosions and car wrecks punctuated by the occasional corpse falling from a mortuary vehicle and getting beheaded by rushing traffic. The action borders on sickening. You expect morality and decency to go out the window in a big dumb cop spectacle; you dont figure on the filmmakers reveling in barbarity. Yet Bay and Bruckheimer seem intent only on stacking bodies higher than the Miami skyline. The sole moment of reflection over the movies murderous mayhem comes in the throwaway line ``Thank God no cops died which follows a calamitous highway chase that in reality would have filled the citys funeral parlors and emergency rooms to overflowing. As they ooh and aah at Bay and Bruckheimers fireworks even the most die-hard action fans simply have to shift uncomfortably over the atrocities theyre watching; if not American society is doomed. Screenwriters Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl from a story by Shelton and Marianne and Cormac Wibberley have fashioned the barest of plots about Miami cops and federal agents trying to bring down a ring of Cuban and Russian mobsters smuggling Ecstasy into Florida in floating coffins. On the case again are trash-talking narcotics detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) along with newcomer Syd Burnett (Gabrielle Union) Marcus DEA agent sister. As a feeble concession to character development the filmmakers toss in a romance between Mike and Syd that they hide from Marcus whos considering dissolving his partnership with Mike. Joe Pantoliano returns as the partners police captain in a role so daft it comes off as awkward ad-libbing. The main villains Peter Stormare as a Russian mob boss and Jordi Molla as a Cuban druglord are ethnic caricatures. The difference is Stormare can act while Molla is laughably over-the-top. Theres really nothing to distinguish good guys from bad boys beyond the fact that the villains speak in outrageous accents while Smith and Lawrence get to crack wise while blowing things up or blowing people away. No matter how smart-alecky and charismatic any characters who could have this much fun savaging the world with bullets bombs and cars are not worth anyones time or money. ""Bad Boys II"" is rated R for strong violence and action pervasive language sexuality and drug content. Running time 147 minutes.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The prize stallion in producer Jerry Bruckheimers stable of blockbuster action stylists director Michael Bay graduated from commercials and music videos with 1995s Bad Boys a rote buddy-cop thriller that in retrospect seems like the opening salvo in an ongoing revolution. More than any current filmmaker Bay has leveled the careful building blocks of narrative cinema knocking them down with the exuberant brand of flashy gigantism on display in The Rock Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. For the seconds (and fractions of seconds) theyre onscreen his images are undeniably pristine; perhaps theyd even be breathtaking if only there were enough time to catch a breath between them. Hacked into a whole the flood of pretty pictures gives the impression of speed and excitement but the visual language is close to indecipherable akin to a German vacation experienced entirely on the Autobahn. Somewhere in the editing suite for Bad Boys II (a predictably bigger and dumber return to the well) footage for the most gripping car chase since William Friedkin and John Frankenheimers heyday likely sits in a computer bin cut to virtual ribbons. As wisecracking cops Will Smith and Martin Lawrence pursue a band of drug-runners along a Miami freeway pileups and near-misses are choreographed with startling physicality highlighted by a car transporter that slings its carriage like a catapult. Bay doesnt seem to care if its impossible to fathom where the vehicles are going or where they are in relation to each other just so long as the immediate impact is felt. Smith Lawrence hothead police captain Joe Pantoliano and a heaping dollop of homosexual panic all reprise their roles for the sequel which reheats another generic plot about murderous druglords and busted scores. This time the bickering Smith/Lawrence duo faces off against Cuban Ecstasy importer Jordi Molla whose mortuary business allows him to smuggle cash in coffins and stuff his pill-bags into the hollowed-out corpses. Their efforts to crack down on Mollas operation and quash a brewing drug war with a Russian gangster (Peter Stormare) are complicated by Martins sister Gabrielle Union who has been working undercover for the DEA and also happens to be sweet on Smith. In devising the idiot plot apparently no one in the distinguished committee of screenwriters could figure out a smart way to infiltrate Mollas estates. In one scene Smith and Lawrence disguise themselves as exterminators hired to kill the rats gnawing on Mollas money stash; in another a siege begins with officers hurling cats and iguanas over the compound wall. As the stars ease too confidently into their familiar chemistry-in this gas-guzzler of a film they get incredible mileage out of Martin getting shot in the ass-Bay ratchets up the Maxim factor with plenty of girls gears guns and gadgets. The redux would be merely shameless were it not so unsettling If Bays two-and-a-half-hour assault on the senses isnt enough cause to reach for the Pepto theres also the disquieting punchlines of a KKK cross-burning ceremony and desecrated corpses splattering on the city streets. Bad Boys II is the rare case in which escapism involves leaving the theater.

Whats not to hate? Charles Taylor Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News If Michael Bays movies are characterized by rapid Cuisinart editing why is ""Bad Boys II"" 146 minutes long? Though three editors are credited -- Mark Goldblatt Thomas A. Muldoon and Roger Barton -- the film has no more been edited (i.e. assembled in a coherent fashion) than it has been written (by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl) or directed. What it has been though is packaged. ""Bad Boys II"" is another Jerry Bruckheimer-Michael Bay demonstration of spectacle -- noise stunts the aforementioned incoherent editing -- taking precedence over story and character. Along the way there are ads for Skyy vodka and Miller Genuine Draft and Pepsi (in a Columbia movie?) along with shootings and beatings and dismemberments presumably to break up the monotony of the crashes and explosions. ""Bad Boys II"" (the sequel to Bays equally regrettable 1995 original) is by far the most brutal American picture released this summer. Its not enough for a bad guy holding onto the side of a speeding Jeep to fly over the edge of a parking garage; his body has to crash into a glass booth below. Its not enough for a villain to go down in a hail of bullets. He has to land in a minefield so we can see the blown-apart bits of his carcass fly up in the air. And when a mortuary van is engaged in a high-speed chase not only do the back doors fly open so bodies go sprawling all over the highway we get to see the speeding cars running over them and in one case severing a head. Michael Bays career (which includes ""Pearl Harbor"" ""Armageddon"" and ""The Rock"") is some sort of reverse triumph the whomping emergence of illiterate filmmaking. By that I dont mean that the film is made for illiterates but that his movies are put together seemingly without any grasp of how to construct a story or even a scene. The editing is so manic that during the chases or gun battles you can never tell where the opposing factions are in relation to each other. Whenever something isnt exploding or crashing whenever Bay has to show two people talking to each other (oh those boring old things) he has no idea how to shoot the scene except in close-ups. Bays success is proof that sheer incompetence need not deter anyone from becoming a commercially successful director. He doesnt have the basic grasp of craft that even hacks were once expected to possess -- and since hes not making movies but demolition derbies the idea of craft is irrelevant. Perhaps though there is one unexpected movie antecedent for ""Bad Boys II."" The end of Michelangelo Antonionis ""Zabriskie Point"" was the directors fantasy of the destruction of America except that instead of people dying we saw only consumer goods blowing up -- a shallow piece of Euro non-thought about U.S. In ""Bad Boys II"" we see a long chase sequence along the Florida freeways with cars flying and crashing into one another being squeezed into tinfoil along a guardrail running over each other bursting into flame. But we see no casualties. Thats fitting because in Bays movies people do not exist. If they are present at all its to provide connecting footage between the action set pieces. You Might Also Like The two human props here are Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as a pair of Florida narcs going after a Euro-scum drug dealer. Romance and dramatic complication are meant to be supplied by a wasted Gabrielle Union as Lawrences sister a DEA agent working the same case undercover. (Lawrence frets that the job is too dangerous for his little sister; Smith assures him she can handle herself. And of course she winds up needing to be rescued.) Smith and Lawrences relationship has been conceived of as a black buddy-movie version of Abbott and Costello with Smith as the cool straight man and Lawrence the sputtering comic relief (except where Lou Costello played a scaredy-cat Lawrence plays someone who ""has problems with anger""). But Abbott and Costello comedies were straightforward affairs and in a movie of this consistently inhuman tone and scale all the stars can do is engage in cutesy-poo buddy-movie banter. Do the people who make buddy movies ever notice that for all the testosterone on display the two heroes always wind up playing coy with each other in a way that would make drag queens blush? Perhaps someone making the movie realized this because we get the requisite scene where the pair are mistaken for gay lovers (and a shot of a pair of actual gays to get an ever bigger laugh). Maybe Bays movie wouldnt seem so crummy if he abandoned the pretense of giving his movies an A-list sheen and embraced being a cheesy exploitation filmmaker. Theyd certainly be more honest. A hack who wanted to get some Tamp;A into his movies wouldnt set up the justifications Bay goes to here for the same thing. Theres a scene in a dance club where wet nubile young things erotically feed each other Ecstasy. (If the movie is to be trusted Ecstasy turns women into lesbians. In that case can someone slip some to the Olsen twins?) A scene in Cuba (yes our heroes not only get to kill bad guys but commie bad guys too) is an excuse to send the camera up the skirt of a street hooker who has no function in the plot. And in the movies most repulsive scene Smith and Lawrence breaking into a mortuary get to leer over the breasts of a young womans corpse. Who is this supposed to turn on? Is Columbia now catering to the necrophiliac market? Or is Bay perhaps intending to demonstrate that rigor mortis has no effect on implants? ""Bad Boys II"" opens with shots of Ecstasy rolling off a drug manufacturing line. Couldnt Columbia with all of Sonys riches at its disposal have distributed tablets to the press before they showed us the movie? I mean if you wound up feeling some love for a Michael Bay movie youd know you were dealing with some killer dope. Charles Taylor is a columnist for the Newark Star-Ledger. More Charles Taylor.

"Bad Boys II Just Another Cop-Out Sequel washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Bad Boys II Just Another Cop-Out Sequel Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 18 2003 LETS NOT get shocked or outraged to learn that ""Bad Boys II"" is just like ""Bad Boys"" only louder longer and the stars get paid more. And lets not fall over backward with surprise when we discover this sequel amounts to a catwalk contest a testosteronal preen-off between Will Smith (the buffed and goateed ladies man) and Martin Lawrence (the eye-rolling human bat). What? You mean the story isnt all it could be? Pah This is simply the episodic return of narcotics cops (and contentious pals) Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) who when we first see them are dressed in white robes and posing undercover with a gang of Ku Klux Klan types. Its a bust which means Marcus is moments away from pulling off his hood and shocking the white right out of these rednecks. Blam Blam Blam go the guns (why do people miss so often in action films?) as Mike and Marcus trade shots with the bad guys and one-liners with each other. Were underway but nowhere near the end. This is a 21/2-hour movie loaded for bear with shootouts car chases helicopter chases and boat chases -- and then it starts all over again. More car chases more shootouts and naturally more funny business. One car chase involves Mike and Marcus chasing after a vehicle transport truck -- you know those rigs that carry half a dozen cars on each level. The bad guys release those chained cars one by one so they come crashing on to the highway causing all the appropriate mayhem. (Amazingly no innocent bystanders are killed -- what luck.) And in another scene our cops speed after a van carrying a pile of plastic-wrapped cadavers that also come crashing down one at a time in front of them. Whether theyre shooting gangsters (dabbling this time in the ecstasy drug trade) swerving from stiffs relaxing by Marcuss cheaply bought pool or (stop me when you hear something original) cringing from their barking supervisor (Joe Pantoliano) our lovable stars play the Will-and-Martin game. Both actors are sitcom veterans and Lawrence cut his teeth in standup clubs so this is easy money for both. One gets annoyed with the other the other gets annoyed back. And after theyve had a few laughs its time for another vehicular pileup. Work work work. Theres also time for a subplot in which Mike gets romantic with Syd (Gabrielle Union) who just happens to be Marcuss sister. Mike doesnt want to tell Marcus about the liaison just yet. Meanwhile Marcus wants to end his professional partnership with Mike and move on with his life. But hes not quite ready to tell Mike yet. Who says mindless summer sequels cant exude character tension? This is why it takes 21/2 hours. But for the target audience nothings too long. Whats not to like? And besides as the song goes ""Bad boys bad boys whatcha gonna do?"" BAD BOYS II (R 150 minutes) -- Contains considerable violence gunplay and action pervasive obscenity sexuality and drug content.

"Bang Bang Ha Ha washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Bang Bang Ha Ha Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 18 2003 ""Bad Boys II"" might be considered three action sequences and four comedy routines in search of a story. Failing to locate one the film diverts to Plan B the invasion of Cuba. That was tried with even less success in 1962 not that anyone associated with ""Bad Boys II"" was alive then or has any passing acquaintance with history. As it plays out here its simply a final idiocy. In the iron logic of summer movies filmmakers are locked into a big-bang theory. The bang at the end has got to be bigger and badder than any previous bangs and so hot-dog director Michael Bay whos already engineered a fabulous car chase in which Chevy Malibus drop off an auto carrier and bounce along the roadway like pumpkins to dissuade our heroes in pursuit has to find the bigger bang. He overreaches badly. Up till then the movie has simply been frenzy tude violence and good clean stupid American fun. Its actually pretty funny Bad boy Miami cops Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) have as much rapport as they had in the original eight years ago. Much of what the two do together seems improvised and its always pretty amusing. The relationship is built along Mel Gibson-Danny Glover lines Lawrences Marcus is a family man nervous trying to deal with his anger career-conscious conscientious troubled. Meanwhile Smiths Mike is a true bad boy a wild card Hes reckless quick-tongued a banterers banterer insanely self-confident. Hes always pushing out Marcus is always pulling back. Put it another way Mike wants to go clubbin Marcus wants to pay the mortgage. So these two battle each other like the Bickersons across the landscape of South Florida while bullets cars and bodies fly their way which they barely notice because each is trying so hard to out-quip the other. Though the film boasts 10 actual screenwriters and story authors I suspect the script was assembled in the following way Extra pages from ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" were mixed in with old scripts randomly selected from the long-sealed files of the ""Miami Vice"" TV show. All those pages were tossed in the air over a staircase then collected from the bottom up. Then just for the wacky fun of it the climax from one of G. Gordon Liddys unproduced screenplays was tacked on. No one ever read any of it of course so each day on the set was a new adventure. The director is Michael Bay and you have to say this guy has chops as an action master. In his last film he blew up Pearl Harbor more thoroughly than the Japanese did and my ears are still ringing. He blew up an asteroid in his film before that the Zen-moron masterpiece ""Armageddon"" which closed on an image of Bruce Willis weeping crocodile glycerin tears as he pushed the button that blew himself and 10 billion tons of deep-space pig iron to bits before it could cue-ball the Earth into the sun. And he was the director of record on the original ""Bad Boys"" in 1995. So when Bay gets revved up theres no calming him down. It so happens that his is the third variation this summer on the somewhat arcane theme of cars-chasing-trucks-and-trucks-counterchasing-cars-on-a-freeway. The first two were in ""Matrix Reloaded"" (anybody remember?) and just two weeks back in ""Terminator 3"" but its Bays stroke of genius to add a fleet of rasta-men with AK-47s to the carnival of wreckage so besides dozens of bouncing cars you have thousands of whizzing bullets. The air is alive with the sound of metal ripping. The problem is this sequence staggering though it is happens too early. Theres no place left to go and the movie still has an hour or so to run (at 21/2 hours its way too long by the way). So the plot -- stop me if youve heard this one before A scurvy yet glamorous Latin chap who shaves with a spoon is importing drugs into Miami and our boys have got to stop him but the DEA is also on the case -- runs out of steam. Well thats an exaggeration Since there was no plot there was no steam. Best to say the plot just quits on the movie. So what eats up the time? Comedy and gunfights. The former is by far the better time-waster. In one sequence sure to be remembered Lawrence and Smith do a number on a poor young man who has come by to court Lawrences daughter; Smith impersonates a somewhat incoherent ex-con to extraordinary levels of dead-eyed craziness. In another Lawrence the better physical comedian has accidentally taken two ecstasy pills and is in a different universe when they go to visit the captain (the redoubtable ubiquitous Joe Pantoliano) to secure his backing for a subpoena. While Smith in the foreground tries to stay focused and professional Lawrence in the background is imitating an octopus stoned on mescaline and patio sealant. Another time-filler subplots. But you ask how can there be subplots if there is no plot? I dont know the answer only that they do it somehow in this movie. One involves Smiths attraction to Syd (Gabrielle Union) an undercover DEA agent who happens to be Lawrences baby sister. Peter Stormare shows up at odd moments as a Russian mafia member being squeezed by the bad guys to utterly no detectable consequence. The movie really loses its mind in its concluding commando junket. You can stay with most of the film because its operating in a zone of summer movie hyperbole and it demands you trade logic for simple pleasure. Okay thats the summer bargain. But you cant stay with this Its simply preposterous that the Miami Police Department would invade Cuba with more firepower than the 101st Airborne hauled into Iraq. Who gave the okay? Oh I get it Condi Rice wasnt available so they called Sonny Crockett and he said it was fine by him. Bad Boys II (150 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence and frequent profanity.

He likes the gruesome effect so much he uses it twice in ""Bad Boys II"" which shouldnt be a surprise since excess and overkill are the movies highest priorities. Superstar producer Jerry Bruckheimers reteaming of Bay with Will Smith and Martin Lawrence was inevitable since the low-budgeted ""Bad Boys"" became one of the top-grossing hits of 1995 pretty much launching the big-screen careers of all involved. Eight years later and that company -- not to mention their audience -- is bursting with the ego demands of more action more car crashes trashier talk bigger explosions prettier guns and all the budgetary overload a studio sequel can handle. ""Bad Boys II"" delivers but as nearly every summertime spectacle is proving this year more seems more and more like less. Movie revie View trailer  ""Bad Boys II"" with Will Smith Martin Lawrence Gabrielle Union Jordi Molla Joe Pantoliano Peter Stormare. Directed by Michael Bay from a script by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl. 150 minutes. Rated R for strong violence and action pervasive language sexuality and drug content. Several theaters. Miami narcotic cops Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) are in the thick of busting an Ecstasy import/distribution operation run by a flamboyant Cuban kingpin named Tapia (Jordi Molla aping the role he played in ""Blow"" and Al Pacinos Tony Montana in ""Scarface""). Their partnership is straining thin after the years; Mikes still the partying player and Marcus the high-strung family man. Smith and Lawrences chemical mix is also strained. They click a little less in the buddy banter partly because of that eight-year ego inflation and partly because of the amplified Bruckheimer/Bay bombast. Fortunately they get lots of chances to crack wise usually in the middle of a high-speed car chase an illegal wiretap operation or while theyre ""breaking the world record for gun fights in a week"" as Marcus puts it. Thrown into the comedy and post-""Miami Vice"" drug-cop drama is the character of Marcus sister (Gabrielle Union) a DEA agent on the same case and a love interest for Mike. But its all just a setup for action violence and more action preferably witnessed by multiple cameras with at least three explosions blood squib bursts or destroyed luxury cars per shot. In a long set piece across Miamis MacArthur Causeway featuring dreadlocked Haitian assassins and a trailer truck loaded with new sedans the vehicular carnage is so extensive the production must have had to open a scrap yard. Another sequence involves mangled cars and mangled flesh as multicorpse hearses and cadavers used in the drug operation start hitting the road -- literally. ""Bad Boys II"" is the latest summer actioner to seamlessly mix camera tricks computer graphics and practical effects in a real-world setting. The result can be impressive -- theres a cool shootout shot that whirls between walls and through bullet holes -- but not if the slam-bang editing makes everything a bewildering jumble. Ah well. Such is the fate of a numbered tentpole blockbuster. With all the brains of ""Charlies Angels 2"" and mechanical mayhem of ""Terminator 3"" ""Bad Boys II"" still represents some kind of high in the low culture of summer sequels.

Its far too much of a not very good thing. 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Bad Boys II Action comedy-drama. Starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. Directed by Michael Bay. (R. 147 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Very funny at times maudlin at others and excruciatingly violent throughout ""Bad Boys II"" -- director Michael Bays latest festival of exploding cars and shaking cameras -- is at 147 long minutes just too much of a mediocre thing. It didnt have to be that way. With another director one willing to admit that the goal wasnt to make a grand opera out of grand nonsense but to craft a brisk unambitious entertainment this could have been a thoroughly enjoyable summer movie. Certainly the comedians were there -- Will Smith and Martin Lawrence sparring well off each other. So was to a surprising degree the script providing a number of generous opportunities for comedy. But how to fit it all in? They couldnt cut out the Smith good parts and they couldnt cut out the Lawrence good parts. And then there were all the bad parts producer Jerry Bruckheimer probably insisted on plus some even-worse parts from Bay. No wonder the movies so long. The action scenes intended to inspire awe inspire the wrong kind of awe a sheer wonder at what the director was thinking. This is Bays approach to filming action He shakes the camera and just as its about to get still he pans usually to the left. Sometimes he changes speed during a pan -- starting slow getting fast. Finally when he arrives at something he wants to focus on he stops and shakes the camera again. Then he cuts. If this is kinetic filmmaking so are half the vacation videos shot from the back of a cable car. There are three car chases maybe four. In one the bad guys are tossing corpses out of the back of a truck in order to disrupt the heroes driving. Thats new -- and yet so old. The problem is not in the way that the chases are done but in the inescapable fact that car chases in and of themselves have become as boring as drum solos. However flashy they signal a five- to 10- minute stretch in which nothing can happen because of that unwritten law No one ever gets caught. Then theres that other unwritten law also widely in play here A machine gun is a worthless weapon. The bad guys might just as well be carrying water pistols. This sequel to the 1995 hit brings back Smith and Lawrence as Mike and Marcus respectively longtime friends and partners. Mike is unflappable and aggressive while Marcus is easily rattled and compassionate. Along with Marcus sister a DEA agent (Gabrielle Union) the bad boys set out to bring down a Cuban drug dealer Tapia (Jordi Molla) working out of Miami. Hes selling a lethal form of ecstasy which is inhibiting his repeat business but hes too perverse to care. Hes also laundering millions of dollars and no one can figure out how. At least seven screenwriters worked on the script for ""Bad Boys II"" and maybe one or two of them understood the story. They might have let us in on it. Then again with a movie like this we know the story without knowing the story. Tapia has bloodshot blue eyes and a dead expression. He is the evildoer. So we have the funny guys and the evildoer. No need to follow the plot; just follow the teams. The hand of Ron Shelton (""Hollywood Homicide"") one of the credited writers is apparent in the handling of Mike and Marcus friendship. Call it a knack call it a gimmick but Shelton has a way of giving his characters colorful personality tics and finding comedy in the way they continue to focus on their fixations in moments of crisis. In ""Bad Boys II"" Marcus has become obsessed with developing his spiritual side while Mike has no use for introspection. Theres a hilarious scene in a TV store when the fellows discuss Marcus personal life while a video camera broadcasts their conversation on dozens of televisions. There are even laughs to be had in the gruesome morgue scene in which Mike roots around inside the bodies of cut-open corpses and Marcus tries to keep his dinner down. Yet after a while the movies preoccupation with mutilation - - a kind of running theme -- becomes hard to take. For about two hours ""Bad Boys II"" exists in a tug-of-war between extreme violence and light comedy. Then it goes completely over to the dark side. Lawrence announces that the case suddenly ""just got real"" which provides an occasion for the sentimental moment when Smith gets to say ""We ride together; we die together. Bad boys for life."" Yes first we get the severed-head jokes and then we get the schmaltz. Then more dismemberments more explosions -- buildings vehicles people. Bay blows up everything including his movie. -- This film contains gruesome dismemberments extreme violence strong language and sexual situations.

And Bad Boys II - a pumped-up Jerry Bruckheimer extravaganza helmed by the worlds greatest attention-deficit director Michael Bay (his motto Nanosecond-Edits-R-Us) - feels as if its high on its own brand of E.A wham-bam two hours and 26 minutes of raging shoot-outs over-the-top (and under and sideways) car chases and adrenalyzed repartee (i.e. lots of yelling) the Martin Lawrence-Will Smith sequel is beyond turbocharged. It whooshes along at warp speed.And still despite some awesomely choreographed stunts and the two stars pedal-to-the-metal appeal the movie seems endless.Beyond endless in fact when in its last half-hour Marcus (Lawrence) and Mike (Smith) decide that they need to invade Cuba. Honest. (Theres a joke there about Michael Bay and the Bay of Pigs but Im too tired to figure it out.)Back in Miami the maverick buddy cops of 1995s Bad Boys are still wreaking havoc on the citys highways and byways and getting scolded for it by their conniption-prone captain (Joe Pantoliano) whos never without a colorful analogy involving invasive objects and the human body. Marcus for one is understandably stressed out by the life hes been leading. Hell be trying to practice his mantra and stay cool but then Mike will get the urge to fire off some rounds or run down some pedestrians and the blood pressure goes off the charts.Compounding Marcus woes is the presence of his sister Sydney (Gabrielle Union) who has told her family that she has a safe and boring desk job with the feds but then turns out to be undercover DEA doing dangerous business with a band of dreadlocked Haitian drug-dealing scum. The same dreadlocked Haitian drug-dealing scum that coincidentally Marcus and Mike have a run-in with. And did we mention that Mike and Sydney are involved on the sly and that if Marcus ever finds out . . . well Mike cant bring himself to tell his partner. He might get upset.With a high-velocity freeway pursuit that tops the car-carnage of The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3 combined the testosterone-fueled flick is anything but restrained. Numerous henchmen and hangers-on are killed and/or wounded various buildings and modes of transport explode and a Russian mobster (Peter Stormare) goes ballistic - when he discovers rats in his cellar gnawing on his multimillion-dollar stash of ecstasy.Bruckheimer and Bay have made a ricocheting wide-screen live-action cartoon where mayhem and mortality mean nothing (except perhaps a laugh or a Keanu-esque whoa) and everything is built for speed.Lawrence and Smith trade barbs and badinage and are wildly funny together in a bit where an earnest young suitor comes to Marcus door to take his daughter on a date. Double-barreled and profane Smith goes some distance toward putting his clean-scrubbed Legend of Baggy Pants image to bed but hes still not entirely believable.Then again who and what in Bad Boys is?Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.Bad Boys II  1/2 (out of four stars)Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer directed by Michael Bay written by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl photography by Amir Mokri music by Trevor Rabin and Dr. Dre distributed by Columbia Pictures.Running time 2 hours 26 mins.Marcus Burnett. . .

"`Boys Ii Is Just Bad News - tribunedigital-orlandosentinel Home-Collections-Lawrence `Boys Ii Is Just Bad NewsMovies - REVIEW - `Bad Boys IIThe Splatter-and-smash Franchise Is Worn Out. Grisly Carnage Played For Laughs Is . . . Too Much.July 18 2003|By Roger Moore Sentinel Movie CriticBad Boys Bad Boys. When you gonna end? When you roll those credits again?Not soon enough. Two hours and 26 minutes of the Will Smith-Martin Lawrence-Michael Bay-Jerry Bruckheimer reunion means about 150 bodies; 100 wrecked cars; two long chases; catch phrases and sentimental corny slogans too numerous to count.Too gory with gruesome violence assorted body parts and corpses violated all played for laughs. Sick sick sick.Too cute with Smith and Lawrence as lifelong pals -- one rich and hip and fearless the other a quivering lump of phobias and family -- bickering and making up every other scene flinging ""Dont hate the playa hate the game"" lines as if theyve discovered wit.And too too long stringing out ending after ending shootout after shootout. In the eight years since the first Bad Boys director Michael Bay has gone on to greater and more wretched excess Pearl Harbor being the most wretched and most excessive. The only thing he seems to have learned since 1995 is which John Woo movies to steal from.Whatever Brownie points Jerry Bruckheimer earned from narrowly avoiding overproducing and over body-counting Pirates of the Caribbean he loses in this over-the-top cop-buddy splatter-and-smash fest.Bad Boys II seems to end half a dozen times. Then after our heroes finish utterly trashing Miami they invade Cuba for a finale that only a militarist like Bruckheimer could dream up.Bad Boys Marcus (Lawrence) and Mike (Smith) havent gotten better jobs in the years since they first teamed. Now theyre on TNT the Tactical Narcotics Team trying to stem the flow of the drug ecstasy into Miami. A second generation Cuban crime lord (Jordi Molla) is buying the drug from the Dutch smuggling it in coffins and selling it to Russian mobsters. Hes funneling the profits into Castros Cuba.Haitian street gangs want to break into the action.The Bad Boys boss (Joe Pantoliano) is concerned""I want you guys to do whatever you do whatever it takes now""Marcus sister Sydney played by the beautiful but limited Gabrielle Union is a DEA agent mixed up in all of the mayhem. Mike is sweet on her.Bodies pile up like cars on Miamis I-195. Its funny how digital effects are hyping up car crashes to the point where we no longer ask ""Howd they do that?""And Marcus who occasionally starts chanting ""Wooo-saaaaaaa"" in some futile attempt at reaching calm in the middle of a gunbattle resolves to break up the bad boys team.Which would be a shame because really these two guys have great chemistry. Lawrence acts as if he cares for the first time in years. And Smith wears his senior partner in this duo with good humor and grace. Youd never know Lawrences career has been on a slow slide in recent years while Smith was anchoring franchise hits and Oscar-worthy biographies. Their rapport is easy and adorable. Pity they can only pair up on foul-mouthed bloodbaths such as this one.In the end there is no end. Bad Boys II just goes on and on with more dazzling camera work more ""funny"" murders and executions by the bad guys and the good guys and judiciously used profanity and the occasional ""N"" word for comic effect.Its fun for a while. But in overstaying its welcome and then some the movie gives you time to ponder what it is youre wallowing in. These boys arent just bad; theyre bad for you.

With Will Smith Martin Lawrence Gabrielle Union. Directed by Michael Bay. Running time 150 mins. Rated R Extreme violence language. At area theaters. 1.5 STARS. Its bigger. Its louder. And like the title says its bad. If you think youre tough enough go ahead and sit through the endurance test that is ""Bad Boys 2"" a brutal 21/2-hour display of production overkill. Serious real estate and multitudes of vehicles were destroyed in the making of this movie but to what end? Somewhere in all the carnage and explosions are two humans Will Smith and Martin Lawrence who in their quieter moments together can be quite amusing as buddy cops in Miami on the trail of a Cuban drug lord and his Russian mafia accomplices. When our guys are allowed to take a breather from the assembly line of car chases they riff off each other like an old married couple. A married couple with Alzheimers that is because some of the jokes must have been so nice they repeated them twice. Or more. With six writers getting credit on the project youd think theyd be more creative. Smith and Lawrence first teamed as squabbling childhood friends Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett for the initial ""Bad Boys"" eight years ago. Time has been good to the budget gods because ""Bad Boys 2"" throws money at the screen so hard that the waste buildup is sickening. Mike and Marcus are trying to head off a huge incursion of the club drug Ecstasy. At the same time Marcus comely sister (Gabrielle Union) who is secretly involved with Mike (is this not the finest-looking couple on the planet?) is coming at the case from another angle through her undercover DEA job. Joe Pantoliano reprises his role as a police captain whod better watch his blood pressure and Jordi Molla and Peter Stormare savor their tooth-sucking scenery-chewing villain roles. The buddy cops spend most of their time in this concussive movie killing maiming shearing off metal and plowing into stuff. In addition to wrecking a lot of cars (22 cars and a boat in the movies first half hour alone) they also run into a log-roll of stiff corpses that spill off a hearse as freely as a flower girl scatters rose petals. ""Its about to get sicker"" promises Mike and he keeps his word. The action set-pieces are grim examples of cinematic one-upmanship and they reveal the outer limits of the genre - bigger and nastier are not necessarily better. Slo-mo bullets smash sickeningly into necks and skulls a decapitated head bounces down the highway fireballs hurtle right toward the camera. In one sequence stolen directly from Jackie Chans ""Police Story"" (but mangled in the process) Mikes crazy driving pulls down a hillside shantytown. The bad guys have so much money lying around that rats are eating it and thats an apt metaphor for this bloated McMovie. Its a spectacular waste because its not attached to a story or characters we particularly care about. The best moments (aside from the pulsing soundtrack) are when Smith and Lawrence tag-team each other to comic effect. They gang up on a teenage suitor of Marcus daughter; they pretend to be from pest control even though Marcus is deathly afraid of vermin and Marcus inadvertently swallows too much X while Mike tries to cover for him. Those scenes were probably shot for pennies proving that when it comes to movie pleasure its still the little things that count.

"When mayhem is all that matters - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovies | MOVIE REVIEW When mayhem is all that mattersWill Smiths charm goes a long way in making the violence palatable in Bad Boys ll.July 18 2003|Manohla Dargis | Times Staff Writer A mind-boggling nerve-numbing adrenaline-pumping combination of shock-and-awe brilliance and idiocy from producer Jerry Bruckheimer director Michael Bay and credited writers Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl the new cop thriller ""Bad Boys II"" doesnt just raise the bar on movie action -- it pulverizes the bar along with most of your senses. Resistance may be desirable especially for the politically squeamish but for dedicated action freaks its futile.Like the 1995 hit ""Bad Boys"" the sequel stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence as Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett who are as famous for literally tearing up the town as for collecting high-profile collars. Friends since high school the pair has the sort of intimate playfully hectoring relationship thats familiar from most two-hander cop movies as well as the usual character lifestyle specifications. Marcus is the family man (a wife three kids a slobbering dog) and something of an embittered clown while Mike is the resident stud the rich kid with the babe-bait moves designer threads and high-performance cars. The added bonus is that hes now played by a genuine movie star.""Bad Boy II"" opens in Amsterdam then hopscotches to the U.S for a tip of the directors cap to one of Bays signature influences Michael Mann. As the camera swoops over the water and heads for the jewel-like Miami effulgent with lights and decadence you could be forgiven for thinking that youre about to watch an episode of Manns landmark series ""Miami Vice."" And at least initially thats how the film plays out via a blend of hyperbolic violence sexual titillation and consumer-savvy multiculturalism -- every villainous Latino has his virtuous twin -- tucked inside a city thats little more than an adults-only playground throbbing with the evil that men do. (Albeit a really long episode because the film runs on -- and on -- for 144 minutes.)After the regulation homage the action turns to a police task force on the verge of a major bust. A caucus of muscle and tattoo the cops are led by punk veteran Henry Rollins which instantly establishes that we are not in generic Hollywood anymore but a fantasyland known as Bruckheimer-ville. Mounted for maximum impact the producers films rarely work in the register of the real which accounts for their success as well as the fact that -- as a rule -- theyre beyond causing serious offense. With the likes of Lawrence and Rollins as cops after all it doesnt seem farfetched that the films first big set piece unfolds in the middle of a Ku Klux Klan rally complete with a burning cross and extras who look as if they should be picking banjos in ""Deliverance.""Smith emerges from this redneck nightmare with each hand wrapped around a gun and the camera gazing up at him from somewhere around his feet. The worshipful vantage and swirling smoke are pure John Woo as is the characters fondness for two-fisted gunplay. Mayhem ensues delivered with the usual Bay touchstones -- bullets tear through the air bodies scatter like confetti sometimes in slow motion although most everything else happens very fast. Its only after the gun smoke clears that a plot emerges involving a Cuban drug lord (a wild-eyed Jordi Molla) and a Russian mobster (reliable baddie Peter Stormare) who are putting Ecstasy on the streets and sending millions of dollars out of the country. Politically expedient villains the two are bad to the bone and given to Grand Guignol butchery.Theres a little more by way of a story including a tepid romance between Mike and Marcus baby sister (Gabrielle Union) a Drug Enforcement Administration agent hot on the same case as her brother and his partner. Ludicrous coincidences are standard in Bruckheimer-ville part of its commitment to unreality. For all the scripts jokes about anger management what counts isnt the human factor but spectacle relentless action and the head rush that comes when stuff goes bang. Thats never clearer than with a demolition-derby freeway chase with dozens of real cars a very large truck and only a few sleights of hand. Trumping every roadway spree in recent memory the chase confirms that even the most sophisticated digital imagery cant compare with crunching fiberglass -- and that Bay is at his best when his cameras are pointing away from the actors.1 | 2 | Next MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOregon school plot allegedly inspired by Columbine Bad...May 28 2013Bad Boys II makes it threeAugust 7 2003Bad Boys II soundtrack stays on topJuly 31 2003Good start for Bad Boys II soundtrackJuly 24 2003Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword",http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jul/18/entertainment/et-dargis18,200,badboysii16,badboysii,latimes

Theyre director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer the bad boys of costly slick action overkill. This is their fifth film together; the first was 1995s original Bad Boys. In between have come The Rock Armageddon and Pearl Harbor each known for lavish attention to chaotic carnage. BBII is no different. Like many of this summers sequels it ups the ante with bigger and noisier car crashes gun fights and pyrotechnics. That all wears thin without a solid story or engaging characters. BBII at least has the characters in Smith and Lawrence who carry this film by sheer force of their comically caustic personalities. But its plot is a routine drug-busting saga bloated to 2 1/2 hours to make room for more vivid violence. For a quick-cut movie geared to short attention spans BBII takes the expansive form of an unlikely epic. As old-fashioned showmen with a contemporary edge Bay and Bruckheimer try to give an audience its moneys worth provided the audience wants spectacular carnage laced with dark humor. But even their fans may be dismayed by the depths to which they stoop here. This is a film in which corpses drop from a van during a high-speed chase flop onto our heroes car and get sliced and diced by other vehicles. In other scenes a severed finger is brandished for comic effect and Smith plunders corpses on mortuary slabs in search of contraband. All this is supposed to be outrageously funny but even in todays increasingly desensitized pop culture many viewers may find it only outrageous. BBII also pushes racial buttons from a fiery Klan rally to a dialogue peppered with the ""n"" word. Beyond such gleeful offensiveness its a crackling creative action flick with Smith and Lawrence again proving well-matched as lifelong pals who feud as the bullets fly. A well-off bachelor with a hot car and cool threads Smiths Mike approaches work with double-fisted gunplay and gonzo aggression. A fearless showboater he freaks out Lawrences Marcus an amusingly panicky family man who often suffers indignities. In BBII Marcus quietly ponders a split from his partner but only after they nail Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla) a vicious Cuban drug lord whos watched Al Pacino in Scarface one too many times. While on the case Marcus wrestles with his works emotional tolls and spouts the unmanly psycho-babble he learned from a velvet-voiced therapist. ""You cant keep suppressing my spiritual growth"" he tells Mike before launching into mood-calming chants. Mike plays along showing ostentatious concern for the demands of their ""dysfunctional relationship."" He also hopes to divert Marcus from his furtive romance with his sister (Gabrielle Union) an undercover agent. On top of their game (especially a buff Smith) both men are energized and boisterously funny especially when they berate a soft-spoken suitor of Lawrences daughter. In another scene Lawrence clowns around after inadvertently taking drugs. Such nonviolent gags serve BBII better than seeing him question a foe before realizing his brains are sprayed against a wall. While BBII often is more callous than comic its useless to expect Bay and Bruckheimer to resist an impulse to go over the top. Pushing the envelope is why theyre in business. Despised by indie filmmakers whose personal films cost less than BBIIs catering budget these bad boys of big-budget excess get the job of brash action done. BBII ripples and rumbles with remarkable stunts especially of a vehicular bent. A demolition derby on steroids it makes 2 Fast 2 Furious look like Driving Miss Daisy. One extended chase on a bridge destroys (as were told in case we lose count) 22 cars and a boat. Mansions and other structures join them on the junk heap. Such is life in the crime worlds fast lane. The trouble is Bay treats collateral damage to people with the same cavalier shrug even though he plays an innocent bystander in a cameo. Serving and protecting the good folks of Miami Mike and Marcus spark the death and destruction of a small war yet remain unconcerned. The only emotions they profess are for their personal lives. Its best to approach BBIIs bloody extremism as if its a fanciful cartoon -- which is what it is anyway. If this film was truly reflective of real life its ghastly gory entertainment would be too bad to be good. Grade B- Todays Deals Open-Box Unlocked Galaxy S7 4G Android Phone for 420 + free...

Rick Groen From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 18 2003 313AM EDT Last updated Wednesday Apr. 22 2009 318PM EDT Comments AA Bad Boys II Directed by Michael Bay Written by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl Starring Will Smith Martin Lawrence Gabrielle Union Classification 18A Rating 1/2Lets begin with the obvious and leave the disturbing news for later. Bad Boys II wherein Will Smith and Martin Lawrence re-dance their buddy cop routine is a B-movie in the most literal sense You got your Bad you got your Boys you got your Bullets you got your Banter. And thats the entire picture the long and the short of it. Actually just the long. For reasons known only to those other killer Bs -- Bay and Bruckheimer (director Michael and producer Jerry) -- this paltry action-comedy weighs in at an obese 2 hours. Perhaps these two got their sequels confused (easy to do these days) and thought they were re-teaming to crank out T he Rockier or Pearl Harbor Redux or Armageddon Again. Naturally we start with the action. Nighttime Miami a shipload of ecstasy is about to invade Americas pristine shores. Seeking to intercept it the buddy bad boys are suddenly surrounded by a bunch of Klansmen with their white sheets and burning crosses. Why? Dunno except that our heroes are black and maybe Bay figures that a whiff of KKK is good for atmospherics. More predictably explosions soon ensue. The first of many things gets blown up real good prompting Smith to make like a critic and pronounce five little words that capture the essence of both the picture and the summer its stuck in. Says he with a sigh ""Some old shit different day"". Pause to introduce the love-interest (Gabrielle Union) then its on to a car chase that in keeping with the inflated spirit of the occasion must last at least 15 minutes. It culminates on a bridge where a giant truck the kind used to transport new cars spews its vehicular contents all over the tarmac -- a driverless rush hour. Devastation finished enter another B -- the bad boys boss -- to yell at them for the trifle of littering the city with jagged metal and burnt bodies. Undaunted they quickly proceed to the next noisy chase which prompts more bossy yelling and well you may be detecting a pattern. In the midst of the clamour about the only quiet sight is the view of the bullets -- they get filmed lyrically in super slow-motion as befits the real stars of the show. But what of the banter the promised comedy you might well ask? Very good question. Smith and Lawrence enjoyed some amusing chemistry in the 95 original but their molecules sure arent jibing here. Its a full hour into this behemoth before theres anything resembling a belly laugh. Instead the script (co-written by a slumming Ron Shelton) seems to be looking for the sort of gross-out yuks favoured by those other bad boys -- the Farrelly brothers. For example at one stomach-churning point our lads are in a morgue rummaging through the chest cavities of corpses -- they know thats where the money is stashed. Funny it aint but as a symbol of the creative act in Hollywood -- relentlessly plundering the dead past for its stored profits -- you could do a lot worse. After two long hours of this we still arent in sight of the climax. But then comes the disturbing bit when matters get perversely interesting. The tales primo villain and chief dope dealer (Jordi Molla) just happens to be a greasy-haired Cuban who as the net tightens hightails it back to his lavish hacienda outside Havana. So in the good name of the war on drugs and a nations psychic security the bad boys team up with a small army of commandos to launch their own private invasion of Cuba -- yep a Bay of Pigs with a happier ending. Under the rallying cry of ""Thats okay were Americans"" the invaders obliterate the dealers compound cut a destructive swath through a shantytown full of indigent peasants and then chased by Fidels own soldiers race towards sanctuary in that bastion of freedom known as -- you guessed it -- Guantanamo Bay. Good grief. From out of the rotten core of this faux blockbuster there crawls a subtext thats positively Rumsfeldian. Then again perhaps the cages of Guantanamo Bay are the ideal resting place a fitting corral for the Bays and the Bruckheimers and the other bombastic combatants of the cinematic wars. After all these bad boys are in the manufacturing business and what they turn out is an explosive cultural product whose definition depends on your political and aesthetic perspective. In some eyes this is a movie; in others its a weapon of mass destruction.

This week were back to normal with Bad Boys II which is business as usual for both summer 03 and Caribbean producer Jerry Bruckheimer who always seems miscast when hes involved with a good movie. This one is more typical of his career appallingly mean-spirited with ha-ha bullet wounds and dismemberments including a scene in which cars run over corpses. Review of the movie Bad Boyz II ( out of four) Stars Martin Lawrence Will Smith Gabrielle Union Jordi Molla Joe Pantoliano Peter Stormare Director Michael Bay Distributor Columbia Rating R for strong violence and action pervasive language sexually and drug content Opens Friday nationwide Yes its Bruckheimer back with director Michael Bay which means that before you risk two-plus hours of backside chafing allow three words to float through your brainArmageddonPearl Harbor. This is no knock on reunited leads Will Smith and Martin Lawrence playing Miami narcs and stalwartly treading through stale gags and situations out of say a Lethal Weapon IX. But Tea Leonis droll dialogue deliveries were the reason Bad BoysI surprised enough people to earn mixed reviews. And shes not back. Instead there are cliches not just from the entire lexicon of crummy movies about drug dealers (this time its Ecstasy) but reprises from the past six weeks at the movies. How many grandiose car chases can one summer sustain unless Seabiscuit is also a competitor? And isnt the scene in which Smith and Lawrence try to bug a dealers mansion oddly reminiscent of The Italian Job? Every time the movie goes off in its own direction it just seems weird. Why is an already bloated running time exacerbated by a long scene in which Smith and Lawrence needlessly berate the teen taking Lawrences daughter on her first date? Same goes for a scene in which the two detectives are mistaken for gay lovers in a TV appliance store. There wont have to be the usual 45 minutes of outtakes on the Boys II DVD. Theyre all in the movie. Ron Shelton who shares screenplay credit with Jerry Stahl has made two of the best sports movies ever (Bull Durham Tin Cup) plus a couple of decent ones (White Guys Cant Jump and Cobb). After directing Dark Blue writing-directing Hollywood Homicide and co-writing this disaster Shelton is in a freeway catastrophe of his own. He had better rip off his badge like Gary Cooper in High Noon and get into that jockstrap --fast.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Bad Boys II has everything. Everything loud dumb violent sexist racist misogynistic and homophobic that producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay can think of puking up onscreen. Worse Bay -- who directed the first Bad Boys eight years ago (it was his feature debut for the director of Armageddon and Pearl Harbor and a day that will live in infamy) -- buries the easy rapport that stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence achieved first time out in this gaping wound of a sequel. Theyre playing the same roles Smith as Mike Lowrey the studly Miami narcotics cop and Lawrence as Marcus Burnett his partner in (fighting) crime. But smugness has infected their performances this time. Theyre so pleased with their preening shtick they dont need an audience. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> What passes for plot involves Marcuss sister Syd (Gabrielle Union) who is working undercover for the DEA and working Mike under the covers. Mike worries about Marcus finding out. And everyone worries about Cuban drug lord Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla) who is taking over the designer Ecstasy trade in Miami. Molla plays the role like Tony Montana on steroids neglecting only to point his gun and put his own spin on the line ""Say ello to my leettle friend."" But enough of the pesky story. Its merely an excuse for Bay to stage a numbing series of explosions car chases and grossouts. Tapia uses a mortuary to smuggle in drugs. The Ecstasy is packed into the body cavities of corpses creating an allegedly hilarious scene in which Mike cuts open a bunch of cadavers guts spilling everywhere. Of course time is taken out for Mike and Marcus to ogle the breasts of a young dead woman. The embalmers call her a ""bimbo."" Tapia prefers to say ""bitch."" In another lovely moment of Bay-like delicacythe corpses fall out of a mortuary truck and are squashed and squished in Miami traffic. Not to be one-upped Tapia dismembers a live body in his mothers kitchen and serves up the bloody pieces in a tortilla box -- the first of many Latino jokes -- to scare his Russian partner (Peter Stormare). And so it goes. Marcus gets shot in the ass in a scene that rivals Bruckheimers TV series CSI for taking us places we dont want to go. Bay follows the bullet like he tracked the first bomb dropped on Pearl Harbor. Its all a setup for the films broadside of gay jokes as a store camera inadvertently records the bad boys discussing the bullet in Marcuss butt (""It hurt going in"") as the stores family-oriented customers react in horror. I should point out that all this including innumerable shots of bullets going into foreheads and skulls being shattered goes on for a punishing pulverizing two hours and twenty six minutes. Theres still a month to go in the sweeps for worst flick of this woefully awful summer but my moneys on Bad Boys II -- the cinematic equivalent of toxic waste -- to take the prize.

Running time 146 minutes. Rated R (gore violence profanity sex). At the Astor Plaza the Chelsea West the Union Square others. BAD Boys II"" more than lives up to the first word in the title - its a vile noisy excessive pandering and seemingly endless follow-up to the modest 1995 buddy-cop hit starring Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. In the hands of returning uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (in their first collaboration since the infamous ""Pearl Harbor"") the belated sequel has been pumped up more than Smiths pecs. But its basically the longest (a butt-numbing 21/2 hours) the most expensive (a reportedly obscene 150 million) most vulgar and by far the stupidest episode of ""Miami Vice"" ever. Burnett (Lawrence) and Lowrey (Smith) are still police undercover agents in Miami and theyre still bickering. Their relationship worsens when Lowrey shoots Burnett in the rear end when they remove their white robes to interrupt a Ku Klux Klan meeting - and are in turn interrupted by a shootout involving drug dealers and the first of the movies enervatingly interminable stunt sequences. A fed-up Burnett has put in for a transfer - and he doesnt even know that his partner has made a secret booty call to his kid sister Syd (Gabrielle Union) also an undercover agent in New York. Now shes in Miami posing as the girlfriend/major-domo of Tapia (Jordi Molla) a Latin drug lord (the worst of the movies many offensive ethnic stereotypes) whos smuggling money and drugs between Miami and Cuba in coffins and dead bodies. Burnett and Lowery are also pursuing Tapia and the chase isnt pretty especially when you have corpses landing on car windows during high-speed chases and Lowery frisking the internal organs of cadavers. The filmmakers show no restraint whatosever racking up a truly sickening body count and at one point throwing in a scene of rats fornicating. Even when they come up with a semi-clever idea - as when the bad guys launch a truck full of cars into oncoming traffic for maximum carnage during a freeway chase - the scene goes on for so long that your eyes glaze over and your eardrums protest. While Smith and Lawrence have an undeniable comic rapport their comic scenes tend to go on long after they stop being funny. Lawrence has one hilarious bit where his character grills his young daughters terrified first date but another scene - where he lurches around the apartment of his exasperated boss (Joe Pantoliano) while under the influence of Ecstasy - sorely calls out for someone to yell ""cut."" An extended sequence in which Lowrey and Burnett are taken for gay is even less hilarious than the filmmakers - who after making a series of PG-13 flicks wallow in gore and bad taste like drunken sailors on shore leave - seem to think. Except for the leads and Peter Stormare as a Russian mobster the actors play second fiddle to explosions and car crashes. Union so funny in ""Deliver Us From Eva"" has less to do as Syd than Eva Mendes in the virtually identical role in ""2 Fast 2 Furious"" while Theresa Randall who had a substantial part as Burnetts wife in the original is reduced to a cameo. This is a movie that just doesnt know when to stop. When Syd is kidnapped the partners literally invade Cuba blow up Tapias mansion drive through the flaming ruins in a Hummer - and lay waste to an entire village. Small wonder Bay and Bruckheimer didnt have them liberate Cuba from Fidel Castro while they were at it. Even in a town as cynical as Hollywood ""Bad Boys II"" marks a new low in contempt for the publics intelligence.

"Bad-a-boom - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Bad-a-boomChock full of explosions chases and shootouts Bad Boys II plays like an action film on steroids""BAD BOYS II"" (star) (star)1/2July 18 2003|By Michael Wilmington Tribune movie critic.Bad Boys II is the kind of movie that gives sequels a bad name even though strangely enough its better than the 1995 hit that spawned it. This movie reunites the Miami detective team of Martin Lawrence and Will Smith for another wild pyrotechnic ride and plays like the buddy-cop action comedy to end them all. By the time the credits roll on this non-stop stylishly bloody crash-a-thon part of its audience may wish just that that ""B.B. II"" would stop the genre at least for a while.Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer know how to press all the buttons spend all the money shoot off all the cliches. Theyre slick and shameless and this second time around theyve got a huge budget and even bigger stars (the Lawrence and Smith of today rather than the hot young TV stars of 1995). The result is a movie that is entertaining and exciting and doesnt let up for a second--but is also sometimes jaw-droppingly awful. ""Bad Boys II"" gives new meaning to that overused phrase ""over the top.""Lawrence and Smith repeat their roles as repressed family guy Marcus Burnett and swinging rich bachelor Mike Lowrey two detectives whose ""odd couple"" anti-chemistry proves hellishly effective for their superiors their criminal prey and themselves. Here the boys are involved in another Miami drug case pursuing the lunatic Cuban-born dope czar/mortuary king Hector Juan Carlos ""Johnny"" Tapia (Jordi Molla) and his maniac buddies Russian mobster Alexei (Peter Stormare) and killer-henchman Roberto (Jon Seda)--with the mysterious help of Marcus sister Syd (Gabrielle Union) who is both Mikes secret lover and secretly working for the D.E.A.While the boys old boss dyspeptic Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) fumes--and while their fellow cops Mateo and Marco (Yul Vasquez and Jason Manuel Olazabal) razz them and cover their backs--Marcus and Mike turn all Miami into an insane playground a melee of gun battles and car chases. ""Bad Boys II"" is a wildly energetic movie and also visually and technically imaginative but theres often something near-psychopathic about it.The first ""Bad Boys"" was modest by comparison a cliched-but-energetic riff on ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Lethal Weapon."" ""Bad Boys II"" tries to blast us out of our seats and nail us to the wall. Every scene is pushed past the limit. Every camera angle is flashy every cut explosive every joke a screamer. At the end the movie piles on more climaxes than a hip-hop version of the William Tell Overture.The jokes are often as vicious as the action is preposterous and though the film makes heavy use of actual Miami cops and locations its set in that buddy-cop never-never land where heroes never wilt even when thousands of rounds of ammunition are fired off at them and whole buildings explode in their faces. In fact Marcus does sustain one injury here--his partner accidentally shoots him in the buttocks--and the movie uses that anal injury for a series of Rock Hudson-Tony Randall-style jokes that pop up with abandon between the gun-battles and coke gags.The movies showcase scene is a real hair-raiser a ""To Live and Die in L.A.""-style freeway chase brilliantly shot and cut but completely ridiculous. Since Tapia runs a string of mortuaries--and uses the coffins and corpses to smuggle money and drugs--we also get shots where Marcus climbs under the sheet with a female corpus delicti and the villains hurl dead bodies out of a hearse during a chase scene.There are jokes about Buddhism bodily functions anger management rat-infested money-storage rooms bloody eviscerations and in a more light-hearted mood a scene where Mike pretends to be a drug-addled ex-con to intimidate the nervous date of Marcus daughter and where Marcus goes goofy in front of Howard after mistakenly ingesting ecstasy.How much you laugh depends on how hardened you are to this kind of film. But ""Bad Boys II"" does have something going for it besides its two feuding costars and surprisingly excellent supporting cast. Director Bay (""The Rock"" ""Pearl Harbor"" Armageddon"") has never directed a good script. But he is a master of the new TV and video-derived super-slick in-your-face action-movie style. In its hectic nutty way ""Bad Boys II"" is a movie that takes a lot of stylistic chances. The story is the same old crock of garbage but every scene is spruced and revved with Bays camera performing acrobatic feats worthy of a wired-up Ridley Scott.Unfortunately most of ""Bad Boys II"" looks like something its own crazy gangsters and cops might enjoy. ""B.B. II"" a film with anger management problems of its own shows off a lot of what modern big studio moviemakers do well--and much of what they do badly.`Bad Boys II(star)(star)1/21 | 2 | Next MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesCouldve been badderJuly 18 2003Here are selected capsule reviews of movies in current...August 8 2003Here are selected capsule reviews of movies in current...August 15 2003Here are selected capsule reviews of movies in current...July 25 2003Poorly Scripted `Bad Boys An Assault On Our SensibilitiesApril 7 1995Find More Stories AboutBad Boys IiTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-07-18/entertainment/0307180398_1_marcus-burnett-bad-boys-ii-mike-lowrey,200,badboysii25,badboysii,chicagotribune
"CNN.com - Review Bad Boys all fired up no place to go - Jul. 17 2003 The Web CNN.com Home Page World U.S. Weather Business Sports Politics Law Technology Science amp; Space Health Entertainment Travel Education Special Reports SERVICES Video E-mail Newsletters CNNtoGO SEARCH Web CNN.com Overview | Gallery | Quiz Review Bad Boys all fired up no place to go Watch it burn at your local theater By Paul ClintonCNN Reviewer Martin Lawrence Gabrielle Union and Will Smith in ""Bad Boys II."" Story Tools RELATED  CNN.com  Reviews archive (CNN) -- In 1995 two TV stars Will Smith (""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"") and Martin Lawrence (""Martin"") teamed up for ""Bad Boys"" helmed by first-time director Michael Bay and produced by the late Don Simpson and his partner Jerry Bruckheimer. Bay Simpson and Bruckheimer never met an explosion they didnt love. The phrase ""boys and their toys"" comes to mind. ""Bad Boys"" opened to mixed reviews but its core audience of adolescent males loved every frame and the film went on to make 140 million worldwide. Eight years later Smith is a major star and Lawrence who has had his share of personal problems has made only a few memorable movies. Bay -- along with Bruckheimer -- gave audiences some of the most testosterone-packed movies of the 90s including ""The Rock"" (1996) and ""Armageddon"" (1998). Just watching them puts hair on your chest. With all that ""Bad Boys II"" was a given. It just took awhile to get all the major players back in place. Still working as Miami narcotics detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) are living much the same way as they were almost a decade ago. Burnett is still the solid family man and Lowrey is still the wild rogue living large on inherited money. Joe Pantoliano still plays their long-suffering boss Capt. Howard. And yes there is still a sexy beautiful woman involved with Lowrey -- this time around played by Gabrielle Union. Throw in a nerve-shattering soundtrack car chases huge explosions with bullets -- and one-liners -- flying and you get the original film supersized. But there is one big difference instead of breaking a heroin ring Smith and Lawrence are after a group smuggling the designer drug Ecstasy. Now thats original. This sequel obviously has a whole new point of view and an entirely fresh take on the first films premise. Going and going and going ... Peter Stormare plays a Russian mobster in ""Bad Boys II."" Okay fine its more of the same -- just more so. The first ""Bad Boys"" clocked in at two hours and six minutes; ""Bad Boys II"" rams on for two hours and 40 minutes and could have ended two or three times but just kept going and going. Youre definitely getting more bang for your buck; too bad most of the bangs look alike. Its a tossup as to which piles up faster dead bodies or wrecked cars -- although I must admit the body count includes numerous corpses tossed onto a freeway during a car chase so Im not sure they should be included. The gross-out factor however is huge. This film really earns its R rating. Bay it seems could care less about character development -- or plot for that matter -- but he has an astounding visual sense. Still just how many times can you smash up a car or blow up a building before it all becomes redundant? The answer to that question my friend is now playing at your local cineplex. This summer slamfest is aimed at its target audience -- young males -- like a laser beam. Itll find them and theyll be fired up but the rest of us will just feel burned. ""Bad Boys II"" opens nationwide on Friday July 18 and is rated R.

As overblown as it is overlong ""Bad Boys II"" is an enervating case of more is less. A simple cop buddy movie really no different narratively than an old ""Miami Vice"" episode extended to unconscionable length in order to accommodate redundant action scenes endless banter between stars Martin Lawrence and Will Smith and several potential endings this elephantine production suffers from serious overkill on the parts of both producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay. This pair never fails to make pots of money to be sure and this eight-years-later sequel will no doubt continue their winning streak. But if summer audiences arent already tired of films with numbers at the end of their titles they will be after this one. Original ""Bad Boys"" put Bruckheimer and late partner Don Simpson back on track in 1995 after a dry spell following their departure from Paramount. It was something of a surprise B.O. performer at the time since Lawrence and Smith were then only known as TV personalities. All the same its 66 million domestic gross and 76 million overseas take were hardly blockbuster figures and the sum of those amounts wouldnt come close to covering the budget for this follow-up which features the two stars as Miami narcotics detectives on the case of a Cuban drug dealer whos on the verge of becoming the top dog in town. Perhaps inspired by a desire to disguise the fact that this premise -- its hardly a plot -- has been used a thousand times the filmmakers throw more money and camera setups at it than anyone has ever been able to afford before and the films feel of excess in all departments curdles what occasional amusement the actors create by dint of their sheer enthusiasm. Sleek opening credits sequence lays out how 150 million in ecstasy tablets are manufactured and shipped in coffins from Amsterdam to Miami. Laying in wait are the U.S. Coast Guard a WACS plane the high-tech-enhanced Tactical Narcotics Team and local cops Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) and Mike Lowrey (Smith) who in a bizarrely silly scene pop out of Ku Klux Klan robes at a cross-burning drop point surprising some rednecks. During the gunfire that ensues a bullet from Mikes pistol is shown making its way toward Marcus butt in extreme slow motion and it can be imagined that someone who finds this hilarious might find great amusement in the remainder of the picture. A leering little disco interlude designed to reveal the effects of ecstasy on club-goers could arguably stand as the quintessential Michael Bay sequence but then its down to serious business that of giving Lawrence and Smith playing lifelong friends and partners a long leash to indulge in their ragging-on-each-other shtick. In the script by the estimable Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl the main source of potential friction aside from Mike having shot Marcus in the ass lies in Mikes recent dalliance with Marcus beauteous sister Syd (Gabrielle Union) a New York DEA agent newly arrived for an undercover assignment involving some Russian criminals who themselves are heading for a showdown with their Cuban rival Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla). For those who havent seen enough gargantuan chase scenes this summer ""Bad Boys II"" features two of them the first a pursuit involving Syd in an SUV some Haitian thugs in a trailer truck they commandeered thats loaded with cars and Marcus and Mike in a Ferrari. The money shots here involve vehicles being pushed off the trailer that then go bouncing rolling and spinning unpredictably over the causeway; true this is a new trick in the chase scene lexicon but the scene is repetitive and overdone in a way that summarizes the problems with the entire picture. The guys get the expected dressing down from their boss (Joe Pantoliano) who like Marcus has taken to Eastern spiritualism therapy and anger management in an effort to cope with the rigors of his job; hes the first police captain to demand that his subordinates remove their shoes before entering his office. After a very imaginatively shot gunbattle between the bad boys and the remaining Haitians in an apartment a scene in which the opponents fire away from opposite sides of an apartment wall as the camera circles rapidly around it to cover the action in both rooms pic settles into a comedy routine groove for a while. In a long digression that might well have served as end-credits filler Marcus and Mike indulge in an intimate discussion in a TV appliance store that is accidentally broadcast on all the monitors and is misconstrued by the shocked customers as a private talk between two gays. After posing as pest exterminators to plant surveillance bugs in Tapias mansion they reach their comic peak here as they ferociously confront a 15-year-old whos come to take Marcus teenage daughter on her first date. Lawrence also has his moments later on when Marcus ingests some ecstasy and begins acting warm and snuggly with Mike and anyone else in his vicinity. Otherwise the more routine the plot developments become -- Tapia kills one of the Russians and takes Syd on as his money-laundering partner before kidnapping her and eventually trying to escape with his ill-gotten gains to Cuba -- the more Bay gives them the hard sell to vastly diminishing returns. The second big chase scene involving a fight on an elevated train feels pointless and the cumulative effect of all the gunfire and wanton destruction and hyperventilating forward motion is numbing. The looming question on a picture like this is why its makers felt obliged to make a 21/2-hour movie when they could have saved tens of millions of dollars by not shooting perhaps 45 minutes of unnecessary footage and in the bargain delivered a tighter tauter more satisfying film. Such is the logic of would-be blockbusters in Hollywood today. As it is Bay directs like a driver who tries to move on city streets the way he does on a freeway without recognizing the value of different speed limits and jamming pedal to the metal until he simply runs out of gas. Many of the stunts and shots are spectacular to be sure but the preponderance of them dilutes their impact. Its easy to see how the citizens of Miami were so famously inconvenienced by this production as certain streets obviously had to be tied up for days on end by the massive chases and crashes staged on them. Technically pic is all-stops-out and padded to the max; end credits reveal a staff of 10 for Lawrence and nine for Smith. Auds who know what they want from the two stars and like it in extended doses will get their moneys worth while others will be happy for another eight-year break between series installments. Union is spirited as usual while Spanish thesp Molla rolls into one performance every cliche of a Latin drug lord seen onscreen over the past 25 years.

In this instance the ringleader of vehicular mayhem is Miami narcotics detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) who is careering along the freeway in one of those silvery aerodynamic sports jobs with his partner the congenitally nervous Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) cowering in the passenger seat. The two are in pursuit of a dreadlocked drug runner whos at the wheel of a shiny red automobile carrier. As they arc over the road the carrier dislodges its contents car by car with each auto tumbling and crashing backward in close-up right into the camera. Marcus ""This is some sick s--"" Mike ""Its about to get sicker"" Apart from its kinetic zest the sequence works for an interesting reason. Normally youre well aware that the movie star youre watching isnt actually doing much of the driving but this logistical reality is never too pesky a distraction in ""Bad Boys II."" Mike as Will Smith plays him is an aggressively righteous badass oozing with furious rule-smashing pride - a fusion of Dirty Harry and Malcolm X with a touch of Mad Max thrown in. You believe that hes driving all right; its part of the feral magnetism of Smiths performance that he refuses to be anyones action puppet. When we first see him hes disrupting a KKK rally swinging a pair of guns around and Smith high on superstar swagger pushes his natural confidence to starkly funny levels of bravura recklessness. Sleek and centered Mike is terrified of nothing whereas Lawrences Marcus with his Pryor-esque facial contortions sees the danger in everything. Their bond is rooted implicitly in their mutual suspicion of the white power structure but when Mike accidentally fires a bullet into Marcus butt it sets off what looks like a terminal personality clash. The smartest thing about the movie is that it allows the two to act as if theyve truly had it with each others foibles. The dumbest thing is the generically convoluted drug plot which features a power war between a couple of cliched foreign Ecstasy kingpins. At 2 hours and 24 minutes ""Bad Boys II"" produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay from a script by Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl might have been subtitled ""Bigger Longer amp; Uncut."" Inflating the concept of the original ""Bad Boys"" until that movie now looks like a backyard tea party its a corporate action comedy that pushes everything including its central relationship to rudely unstable extremes. There are machine-gun shoot-outs jammed next to nudge-nudge parodies of anger management. There are rats buckets of bloody limbs and drugs stowed in icky sucked-out corpses. Theres an excruciating sequence in which our heroes discuss Marcus butt wound on an electronics stores display TVs (Get it? They sound gay in front of the whole store) and a very funny one in which they act like ghetto ruffians to terrorize Marcus daughters teenage date. Long after any self-respecting movie would have ended theres a finale in Cuba that exists for no purpose except to detonate a mansion in high tinderbox style. Did I mention that Marcus drops Ecstasy which prompts him to make love to his own nipples? In the 1980s Bruckheimer and his partner Don Simpson wanted to win and so they made movies about winning (""Flashdance"" ""Top Gun""). As the era theyd helped set in motion progressed winning became defined more and more as the blowing up of box office records by blowing up more things on screen (""Bad Boys"" ""The Rock""). They turned adrenalized aggression into a cinematic narcotic and though Simpson died in 1996 Bad ""Boys II"" follows the pairs flash-boom aesthetic with its nasty slovenly fitfully entertaining amalgam of thrills and petty blasphemies its buddy repartee served up as a verbal form of contact explosive. Mike and Marcus razz a pair of Latino cops they razz the whiny Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano) they razz each other over Mikes affection for Marcus sister (Gabrielle Union) who in the movies most awkward contrivance just happens to be an undercover DEA agent. Smith and Lawrence give good razz but ""Bad Boys II"" proves that its possible to pack a movie with so much popcorn that it leaves the audience overdosed.

"Bad Boys II | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bad-boys-ii ) Bad Boys II (United States 2002) A movie review by James Berardinelli The only thing as bad as bad comedy is bad action. Bad Boys II has plenty of both. In fact those two things are all it has unless you count the small helping of bad drama. When it comes to this movie the word ""bad"" initially seems highly appropriate. But Bad Boys II isnt just bad - its a catastrophic violation of every aspect of cinema that I as a film critic hold dear. It seems to have been constructed with terms like ""unwatchable"" and ""godawful"" as its slogans. There are motion picture failures every year - the resumes of Hollywood players are littered with them. But when something this big - a would-be blockbuster with recognizable names in the cast and crew - collapses in such a spectacular fashion its worth taking note. Think of how many starving children could have been fed with the money that was poured into Michael Bays latest sinkhole. The average summer action movie aspires to be nothing more than a ""lobotomy flick"" - a motion picture enjoyable only by those who turn off the thinking centers of their minds while in the theater. The original Bad Boys was such a film - an excursion into pyrotechnic buddy movie mediocrity. Would that such a high compliment could be paid to its successor. Watching Bad Boys II is a singularly unpleasant prospect. Not only is it exceedingly long (the result of titanic self-indulgence and the inability of director Bay to cut anything) but each scene is worse than the one before making the viewing experience akin to a plunge into the lowest depths of hell. Anyone who truly enjoys this movie may wish to consider seeking professional help - if theyre not already beyond it. The paper-thin storyline involves Miami PD partners Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) as they attempt to take down Cuban drug kingpin Johnny Tapia (Jordi Molla) on those rare occasions when theyre not too busy bitching at each other. Johnny with the help of a Russian mobster (Peter Stormare) is flooding the West Coast with Ecstasy. Along the way the two ""bad boys"" encounter their share of trouble including car chases shootouts and explosions. Mike tries to hide his blooming relationship with DEA officer Sydney Burnett (Gabrielle Union) Marcus sister from his partner. And Marcus avoids telling Mike that he wants a transfer. The action sequences are worse than routine - theyre boring. They all follow much the same pattern explosions gunfire someone rolling on the ground in slow motion the camera circling the action two or three times rapid-fire cuts so fast that you dont know what the hell is happening more explosions more fast cuts more slow motion and so on - until you want to scream out ""MAKE IT STOP"" Since the projectionist will be asleep by this point such a merciful blessing is unlikely to occur. Once in a while Bay will vary things by throwing in a shaky handheld shot in between one slow motion shot and the next one. Or he will have a character utter an unbelievably inane line of dialogue. If I didnt know better I would be tempted to think that Bay was attempting to parody big-budget action movies but Bad Boys II doesnt give off the right vibes for a satire. Not that it expects to be taken totally serious. There are plenty of stabs at comedy - although none of them hit the funny bone. It is said that any subject no matter how taboo can be the subject of humor. Monty Python proved that. The key is that the material has to be funny. If it misses the mark you end up with Freddy Got Fingered or Dumb and Dumberer. And thats pretty much the territory into which Bad Boys II treads when it tries to make the audience laugh. The jokes are limited to a few inspired categories racial slurs cadaver mutilation homophobic gags and rodent copulation. There is a charisma mismatch where the two lead actors are concerned. Despite being let down by the direction and the screenplay Will Smith nevertheless manages to achieve a cetain level of charm and considering the circumstances thats an amazing accomplishment. Martin Lawrence on the other hand appears to be in the grip of desperation. Despite being a hilarious stand-up comedian Lawrence has yet to translate his outrageous personality to a screen character. In fact its striking how unfunny he is. Gabrielle Union is on hand to provide some Tamp;A and Jordi Molla froths at the mouth enough so we know hes the bad guy. Bad Boys II represents a new low for director Bay who at least to this point could be counted on to make semi-competent popcorn movies (although his one attempt at something serious Pearl Harbor was a laughable lumbering failure). This film however needs more than salt and butter to make it palatable. Bad Boys II represents another reason to avoid multiplexes this summer and a further argument against the serialization of movies that do not have franchise potential.
