Fox Jonathan Lipnicki Geena Davis David Alan Grier Jeffrey Jones Bruno Kirby Nathan Lane Hugh Laurie Chazz Palminteri Stan Freberg Jennifer Tilly Steve Zahn; Director Rob Minkoff; Author M. Night Shyamalan; Runtime (in minutes) 84; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted January 7 2000 -- 1200 AM EST New York City kid sends Mom and Dad off to buy him a baby brother. Mom (Geena Davis) and Dad (Hugh Laurie) adopt a mouse instead name him Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox) and warn kid George (Jonathan Lipnicki) and cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane) to be good. In Mayor Rudolph Giulianis town there are laws against this kind of unnatural nuclear unit but in Stuart Little based on E.B.Whites classic childrens book the interspecies mischief makes for a charming family movie about feeling different being bullied and fitting in as Stuart faces down torment by the jealous Snowbell. It also makes for an impressive display of digitalized rodent antics. For all the nifty cavorting at Stuarts disposal and amid all the gingerbread charm Rob Minkoff (who codirected The Lion King) brings to his conception of a bustling world capital with the feel of a Cotswolds village the star of this show is Snowbell. As he did while speaking through the mouth of an animal in The Lion King Lane creates a great wiseacre character and his feline cronies (voiced by Chazz Palminteri and Steve Zahn) provide the big cat with appropriate wise-guy banter. Stuart Little doesnt have the free-associative wit of Babe or the looking-glass fascination of the underappreciated 1997 movie adaptation of The Borrowers but a Little goes a long way.

Comments Stuart Little A computer-generated mouse with the voice of Michael J. Fox is adopted by Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie in this boring irksome family movie based on a book by E.B. White. The special effects are devoted to action--as when the mouse driving a miniature sports car eludes several cats in Central Park--as well as cuteness though several one-shot scenes hyping the mouses wardrobe and domestic exploits are inexplicably relegated to the closing credits. That the adoptive parents and the adoptee belong to different species is the basis of the humor in the marvelously straight-faced performances by Davis and Laurie--but its also a metaphor that allows the story to use class and ethnic stereotypes in support of the idea that its best to be adopted by rich white people. Rob Minkoff directed a screenplay by M. Night Shyamalan and Greg Brooker. 84 min.

Whites ""Stuart Little"" does a more-than-passable job of resurrecting the story for a new generation. Still despite technically impressive animation ample doses of humor and seamless special effects the filmmakers have taken a slick commercial approach to the material that turns Whites magical 1945 tale into a labored feel-good movie. Given what a tricky proposition it is to adapt a classic childrens book for the screen this take on E.B. Whites ""Stuart Little"" does a more-than-passable job of resurrecting the story for a new generation. Still despite technically impressive animation ample doses of humor and seamless special effects the filmmakers have taken a slick commercial approach to the material that turns Whites magical 1945 tale into a labored feel-good movie. That may make good business sense at a time when the name Buzz Lightyear means a lot more to kids than Stuart Little but it wont meet the expectations of viewers familiar with the source. Parents at least initially will happily take the kids along to this family-themed pic but its questionable whether younger auds will enthusiastically take up the cause themselves. Using Whites story as a point of departure scribes M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"") and Greg Brooker and director Rob Minkoff have taken license to play up the tales dramatic and cinematic elements. Presumably the birth of a rodent into a human family (the books scenario) would have been difficult to explain so in this version Mr. and Mrs. Little (played with earnest eccentric charm by Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) cheerfully trot off to a Gotham adoption agency having promised to bring home a little brother for their son George (""Jerry Maguires"" Jonathan Lipnicki). George is less than thrilled when for reasons not fully clear his parents return from the orphanage with a mouse named Stuart (voiced with boyish glee by Michael J. Fox). Even more irked with the new arrival is family feline Snowbell (a scathingly funny Nathan Lane). Though Snowbell initially mistakes Stuart for dinner Mr. Little reminds the cat that Stuart is family ""and we dont eat family members."" Appalled Snowbells alley cat pals insist the mouse must go so they consult feline crime boss Smokey (a raspy Chazz Palminteri) who brings in a pair of wayward mice (Bruno Kirby and Jennifer Tilly) to pose as Stuarts long-lost biological parents. Though saddened at Stuarts departure the Littles feel hed be better off with his own kind. What they dont know is that his ""parents"" are part of an elaborate kidnapping scheme. Stuarts desperate attempts to return home make up much of the final act along with a Central Park confrontation that pits the mouse against a group of tough-talking felines (among them a hilariously dry Steve Zahn). Some of this sequence might prove too scary for small viewers though most everyone escapes unscathed. The humans play supporting roles here; without much to do they tend to serve as window dressing in support of the more interesting animated creatures. The animals especially the cats get all the best lines making the humans seem dull or dim-witted by comparison. In all tech areas ""Stuart Little"" is top-notch. The digitally rendered title character is thoroughly convincing with attention paid to the most minute details from the sheen of his fur to the folds of his tiny trousers (his head alone boasts a half-million computer-generated hairs). Bill Brzeskis production design envisions the Littles Gotham as an idealized squeaky-clean city that in Guillermo Navarros lens has all the intimate charm of a hamlet. Similarly Joseph Porros dapper costumes recall a more innocent era and the striking primary colors of Mrs. Littles wardrobe complement her resolutely perky demeanor. Alan Silvestris upbeat score advances the action nicely.

Starring Geena Davis Hugh Laurie Jonathan Lipnicki with the voices of Michael J. Fox Nathan Lane Chazz Palminteri. Directed by Rob Minkoff. (PG. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The Stuart Little of ""Stuart Little"" is smart precious and fun. Hes a fuzzy white mouse that walks and talks like a human a kind of Woody Allen type. One can almost visualize wrapping him up as a Christmas present because to tell the truth hes a giant step forward for mousekind. Its too bad then that ""Stuart Little"" opening today doesnt quite measure up to the extraordinary sweetness of the classic childrens book by E.B. White on which it is based. But then again how could it? As a family film ""Stuart Little"" has its charms. But it also has major slow spots too much sappiness and talking cats as street-wise gangsters that may prove unsettling to the very young. Just because its the 90s one guesses movie studios have to put an edge on things. This film ought to be far more cuddly wise and filled with fun antics but oh well. Stuart himself is the great delight a sensational visual-effects creation supervised by a noted wizard of such things John Dykstra a ""Star Wars"" veteran and a founder with George Lucas and Gary Kurtz of Industrial Light amp; Magic. All the visual effects and digital characters by Sony Pictures Imageworks are seamless. CHARMING CREATION Its almost impossible to see the computer-created Stuart (voice by Michael J. Fox) as anything but a wonderful life form. You want to hang out with him and help him carry his itsy bitsy straw suitcase. His fuzzy face and bright eyes are loaded with expression hes got real- looking teeth and he moves with the grace of Fred Astaire. We need more of these charmers in our lives. In ""Stuart Little"" Manhattan is a candy-coated storybook place vintage 40s. There in a small house wedged between great buildings the Little family of humans resides -- Mrs. Little (Geena Davis) Mr. Little (Hugh Laurie) and their preteen son George (Jonathan Lipnicki). Theyre really nice in a gee-whiz way. George desperately wants a baby brother. His parents decide to adopt and at an orphanage full of human kids they resolutely pick a mouse named Stuart. Its a bit wacky of course but that is the gentle spirit of the book soon lost as the movie progresses. NOT MAD ABOUT MOUSE George just doesnt get it at first. ""Hes only a mouse"" he says with a sigh. But Georges disappointment hardly registers with his plucky parents -- Davis and Laurie are charming in their roles. George and Stuart inevitably bond and when Stuart goes missing the boy burns with that frantic sense of having lost the person in life he loves most. ""Stuart Little"" makes one unabashed try after another to pluck heartstrings. For some people it might work. Then there are those darn cats. The film cleverly characterizes the big white Little house pet Snowball (voice of Nathan Lane) who is understandably miffed about his familys adopting a mouse treating it as human and worse loving Stuart to pieces. Snowball could stomp Stuart but stops short. Other cats are less kind. Smokey (Chazz Palminteri) is a gang boss who puts out a hit order. He and fellow felines try to snuff out Stuart in Central Park. But dont worry no mouse as cute as Stuart is going to get rubbed out especially in a Christmas movie. ..

Theres a scene in which the animated mouse Stuart and his human brother brush their teeth before bedtime. And thats being used in television commercials for Smileworks.com. an interactive Web search site for dental referrals. Its nice that the people at Sony have come down firmly in favor of dental hygiene. But is this glossy movie good for anything other than flossing? VIDEO Theatrical preview for ""Stuart Little"" QuickTime Play Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K E.B. Whites 1945 ""Stuart Little"" is a charming bedtime story containing nice messages about the importance of family and the acceptance of others differences. It was meant to be read by parents to their preschool children. Now ""Stuart Little"" the major motion picture -- with some major plot changes -- is a slick commercial vehicle that maintains only some of the original charm of Whites work. This screenplay by M. Night Shyamalan (""The Sixth Sense"") and Gregory J. Brooker retains some nice messages. Its still aimed directly at preschool children but its feel-good ""golly gee"" attitude wears out its welcome long before the final credits roll. The rats race When George Little played by the irrepressible Jonathan Lipnicki (""Jerry Maguire"" 1996) begs his parents (Geena Davis Hugh Laurie) for a younger brother they dutifully head off to an adoption agency. The original story had Mama Little give birth to a mouse supposedly a concept too hard to swallow in this day and age even for a small child. MESSAGE BOARD Movie reviews Top of the box office When Mom and Dad come home from the agency with a talking well-dressed mouse named Stuart George is less than pleased. Hows he supposed to ride bikes and play ball with a rodent? Also underwhelmed is the family cat Snowbell scathingly voiced by Nathan Lane. After Snowbell mistakes Stuart for lunch and is admonished that he ""shouldnt eat family members"" he turns for help to a bunch of lowlife alley cats ""high on catnip."" These wild and crazy felines provide what comic relief is available in the film. Chazz Palminteri who does a great job voicing the head alley cat Smokey hatches a diabolical plot with Monty (Steve Zahn) and Red (David Alan Grier).

Fox Jonathan Lipnicki Geena Davis David Alan Grier Jeffrey Jones Bruno Kirby Nathan Lane Hugh Laurie Chazz Palminteri Stan Freberg Jennifer Tilly Steve Zahn; Director Rob Minkoff; Author M. Night Shyamalan; Runtime (in minutes) 84; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor Columbia Pictures Posted January 7 2000 -- 1200 AM EST New York City kid sends Mom and Dad off to buy him a baby brother. Mom (Geena Davis) and Dad (Hugh Laurie) adopt a mouse instead name him Stuart (voiced by Michael J. Fox) and warn kid George (Jonathan Lipnicki) and cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan Lane) to be good. In Mayor Rudolph Giulianis town there are laws against this kind of unnatural nuclear unit but in Stuart Little based on E.B.Whites classic childrens book the interspecies mischief makes for a charming family movie about feeling different being bullied and fitting in as Stuart faces down torment by the jealous Snowbell. It also makes for an impressive display of digitalized rodent antics. For all the nifty cavorting at Stuarts disposal and amid all the gingerbread charm Rob Minkoff (who codirected The Lion King) brings to his conception of a bustling world capital with the feel of a Cotswolds village the star of this show is Snowbell. As he did while speaking through the mouth of an animal in The Lion King Lane creates a great wiseacre character and his feline cronies (voiced by Chazz Palminteri and Steve Zahn) provide the big cat with appropriate wise-guy banter. Stuart Little doesnt have the free-associative wit of Babe or the looking-glass fascination of the underappreciated 1997 movie adaptation of The Borrowers but a Little goes a long way.
