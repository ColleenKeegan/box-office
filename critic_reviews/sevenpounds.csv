Calling emergency services he looks on his last legs before we cut back to trace what brought him to this point of no return. Its then we meet mean Will Smith an IRS agent seemingly specialising in pursuing the disadvantaged such as Woody Harrelsons blind piano teacher and Rosario Dawsons stationery designer with a heart condition. Still a bit curious that Smiths living in a cheap motel all the while since intercut moments suggest a family life somewhere in the past. What can it all mean? Actually the films distributors have us sworn to secrecy but chances are that if we did spill the beans you wouldnt believe us. Its totally bonkers. Kudos though to director Gabriele Muccino (who previously helmed the rather grittier Smith entry The Pursuit of Happyness) for drip-feeding us towards the big reveal with no little style turning out a movie thats seductively lithe and sheeny giving every impression of in-the-moment gravitas... rather like a superior car advert. Smith does enough here to suggest that hes pushing at the edges of his goody-goody image while Dawson works wonders in a role so thankless it should have its own awards category.However all concerned are mere pawns in thrall to a central conceit that sails beyond mere sentiment to encapsulate the surreal. Its not what youd call any good but Claude Lelouch fans say might relish its grandiose romantic gestures in the face of all known logic.

It was touching poignant and beautiful film for an actor of his age. Does he always have to be running flying jumping or dodging robots and aliens to keep fans and critics happy? Should he just do a jigga dance black up and be done?

December 20 2008 Save for later Saved Will Smith stars in Columbia Pictures drama Seven Pounds.. Courtesy of Columbia Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Will Smith is the biggest movie star in the world. He can make just about anything he wants to. And therein lies the rub. His new movie ""Seven Pounds"" coming after ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and ""I Am Legend"" seems like the third in a trilogy of inspirational bummers.If anybody but Smith was starring in this lugubrious claptrap it would be close to unwatchable. Even with him around its a long sit. He plays Ben Thomas a woebegone widower who sets out to radically improve the lives of seven strangers. Since the reason for his mission is revealed incrementally I will not spoil the show here except to say that organ donor societies might want to use this movie for a fundraiser. Or not. As high concepts go ""Seven Pounds"" is distasteful in the extreme.Movie stars often become so powerful that they lose all perspective when it comes to choosing appropriate projects. (Remember Bill Murray in ""The Razors Edge""?) You cant fault an actor for stretching but in ""Seven Pounds"" Smith is in full messianic mode and it drags him down. He also drags everybody else down with him. Rosario Dawson in particular playing a gravely ill woman romanced by Ben looks mightily uncomfortable. One actor Elpidia Carrillo breaks through the heavy-duty haze of inspirationalism. As a terrorized single mother Carrillo jump-starts the movie during her brief screen time. Unlike the other cast members she doesnt seem to be playing a stick figure in a morality play. Grade C-. (Rated PG-13 for thematic material some disturbing content and a scene of sensuality.)

Reed found a subtler tone in his Vince Vaughn-Jennifer Aniston hit The Break-Up in which both the humor and the despair rose from domestic behavior that if exaggerated for dramatic effect was still recognizable. Yes Man straddles those two styles. It ambles along Judd Apatow-style (and includes a fellatio gag that should have earned the movie an R rating) while affording Carrey a few opportunities for his patented rubber-face comedy pyrotechnics. The more impressionable kids will be imitating his ""Red Bull"" riff throughout the holidays. Though the movie is no more than agreeable it does provide a swell showcase for New Zealand wundercomic Rhys Darby (Murray the hapless agent on HBOs Flight of the Conchords) and gives the astrally adorable Zooey Deschanel a rare shot at a lead role in a big Hollywood movie. Casting directors please take note. Will Smith No Man Everybody in Yes Man including Carrey in his depressive phase is pretty darned perky -- a mood that applies to no one in Seven Pounds. And whereas Carl is using his personal epiphany to make himself happy Ben Thomas does good only for others; hes paying it forward not inward. A child undergoing cancer treatment a mother whose boyfriend abuses her a blind pianist (Woody Harrelson) a young woman suffering from congenital heart failure (Rosario Dawson) -- each of these and three others he showers with rejuvenating gifts. His motive is the movies secret. Directed by Gabriele Muccino and written by Grant Nieporte Seven Pounds continues a string of movies -- The Pursuit of Happyness I Am Legend Hancock -- in which Smiths characters are isolated and superior estranged from normal life ultimately trying to make contact with ordinary folks. Its been ages since the star flashed his charismatic smile for a whole movie. Here he speaks to people with a precise courtesy that seems learned rather than felt. Pain pulses just behind his fretted eyebrows; he carries himself like a hero too gentlemanly to show his grief too weighed down to hide it. Those whom Ben touches see that hes on a mission beyond making their lives more bearable. The same may be true of Smith rashly or bravely hes using his immense celebrity to lure audiences into an alternate movie world where kindness and desperation feed off each other. In these recent movies Smiths stature has kept him from connecting with anyone but his own son (in The Pursuit of Happyness also directed by Muccino) and the mass of moviegoers. Here though -- and this is what lifts Seven Pounds above other Smith dramas -- he does tentatively allow another adult onto his solitary planet. Dawson glammed down in hospital gowns and an invalids grayish sheen is knowing giving and (her word and ours) hot. Shes splendid at showing how someone whos tucked herself into the reclusion of her illness wills herself to bloom in the presence of someone with a secret mournfulness greater and perhaps less curable than her own. Its a lovely performance in part because her character throws every charm shes got at the one man who seems doomed to deflect it. The message of Seven Pounds (other than Dont text-message while driving) is that even the most depressive person can find a way to make other people happy. If that doesnt sound like a movie to buoy your Christmas spirit ask yourself this How often do you sit through a films closing credits so you have a little private time to wipe away the tears?

After decades of giving and taking punishment in a sport that isnt a sport hes got a split bicep a cracked clavicle a deaf ear wrecked knees and assorted other body parts that hurt as he puts it wryly only when he breathes. On top of that he hates himself with merciless passion. Its almost another miracle then that the director Darren Aronofsky and the writer Robert D. Siegel have turned the story of this washed-up faux gladiator into a film of authentic beauty and commanding consequence. ENLARGE Mickey Rourke is shown in a scene from The Wrestler. Associated Press/Fox Searchlight Certain scenes are hard to watch since the truth of pro wrestling is more complicated than mere fakery. The matches are staged to be sure with stagecraft that can involve appallingly elaborate torture rituals. Yet much of the suffering is real as ""The Wrestler"" demonstrates graphically; its consensual torture with such sado-masochist tools as barbed wire broken glass forks and staple guns. So avert your gaze if you must from time to time but not for too long because Mickey Rourke a gifted actor whos had his own massive career problems is suddenly back in full force with a phenomenal performance that takes pain as a starting point and quickly transcends it. Something of the same can be said of the director. His mysterious debut feature ""Pi"" announced the arrival of a singular talent and the promise was confirmed by the brutal power of ""Requiem for a Dream."" Then came ""The Fountain"" a turgid fantasy about eternal life that might have knocked a lesser talent out of the movie business for the career equivalent of eternity. Happily Mr. Aronofsky is back in the ranks of the bankable. ""The Wrestler"" is an imposing entertainment on several counts not the least of them being the scruffy milieu in which the much-diminished Ram grabs occasional matches and signs autographs for fans with long memories. (Maryse Alberti did the high-contrast high-impact cinematography.) For a while the film shapes up as a fairy-tale variation on the theme of ""Rocky."" Randy hopes to revisit his glory days of the late 1980s when he was a superstar on the professional circuit by getting into good enough shape to restage a classic battle with one of his best-known adversaries. Marisa Tomei gives a wonderfully nuanced and affecting performance as Cassidy a stripper whos almost at the end of her own string. (I do wish she hadnt been stuck with a gratuitous speech that draws glib equivalence between the wrestlers suffering and ""The Passion of the Christ."") Evan Rachel Wood is Stephanie the estranged daughter Randy reaches out to as intimations of mortality grow ever louder in his battered head. As fairy tales go however this is a tough-minded one. Pain has become a part of Randys tortured psyche an addictive drug that he treats with other drugs. The ultimate subject of ""The Wrestler"" is personal destiny and whether it can be changed. Seven Pounds Until today the subject of ""Seven Pounds"" has been kept under wraps. A huge marketing push signaled only the imminent arrival of a Will Smith movie starring Will Smith with Will Smith in the main role. Now we know why. And now we know why the star has been looking so mournful in all those trailers display ads and billboards. His latest film is about nothing less than life and death sin and atonement and it takes the soggy cake for multiple layers of sentimentality topped by indigestible grandiosity. That doesnt mean its bound to flop. In a time of diminished star power Mr. Smith is one of the last superstars with a dependably huge following. Still theres been a steady increase in the self-importance quotient of his most recent hits including last years treacly fable ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" and last summers bizarre and ponderous ""Hancock."" Moviegoers with more generous spirits than mine may well be stirred by the quasi-religious quotient of ""Seven Pounds"" which was directed by Gabriele Muccino from a screenplay by Grant Nieporte. But Mr. Smith keeps himself so shamelessly at the center of things and the camera dwells so worshipfully on his anguished face that he seems to be anointing himself as the sacred embodiment of his own sermon. The movie begins with his character Ben Thomas in extreme anguish. ""Theres been a suicide"" he tells a 911 operator. When she asks ""Whos the victim?"" he replies ""I am."" This apparently scrambled sequence of tenses can be explained but you wont find the explanation here. Laying out the plots logic such as it is would spoil the suspense such as it is. All I can tell you is that Ben is a man with a fateful mission that the mission requires him to make solemn judgments on the goodness quotient of several individuals that Rosario Dawson plays a woman of unquestionable goodness and that Ben turns the matchlessly lethal venom of a box jellyfish into an instrument of expiation. He keeps the jellyfish in a big tank filled with ordinary tap water which would ordinarily kill the little bugger in no time flat. But a man who makes a movie about life and death gets to make all the rules. Yes Man ENLARGE Jim Carrey in Yes Man. Warner Bros. It would be churlish to naysay ""Yes Man"" so I wont. Jim Carreys new comedy is enjoyable enough for what it is a clever idea developed by fits and starts. And once the premise is established -- rather laboriously -- it works up a head of steam that could pass albeit briefly for inspiration. Mr. Carrey is Carl Allen a junior loan officer who says no to just about everyone and everything. If senior loan officers had followed his example in recent years we might not be in the fix were in but Carls rejectionism springs less from any sense of the mortgage market than from the pain of a lost love. All of this changes as the title suggests when a New Age Elmer Gantry played broadly by Terence Stamp persuades him to embrace life by saying yes to everyone and everything. The possibilities of this comic scheme are endless though not necessarily comic. ""Yes Man"" doesnt come fully to life until Carl meets Allison a kooky free spirit played by Zooey Deschanel. Kookiness isnt necessarily comic either but Ms. Deschanels sexy subtlety and endearing reserve seem to set Mr. Carrey free. Yes is the only correct response to Carls encounter with a would-be suicide and to a trip he takes with Allison to Nebraska. For the rest its a definite maybe.

It wasnt his first feature film but it was the film in which he showed himself to be an exceptional young actor in the company of other exceptional young actors. Among them were Steve Guttenberg Daniel Stern Paul Reiser Kevin Bacon Tim Daly and Ellen Barkin.

"Seven Pounds Will Smith takes a risk | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsSeven Pounds Will Smith takes a riskThere are no half measures with Seven Pounds  the new Will Smith movie just as there is no adequate way to describe the plot without spoiling it.Will Smith right and Rosario Dawson in a scene from Seven Pounds.  (MERRICK MORTON)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Dec. 19 2008 Seven Pounds (out of 4)Starring Will Smith Rosario Dawson Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper. Directed by Gabriele Muccino. At major theatres. 118 minutes. 14A There are no half measures with Seven Pounds the new Will Smith movie just as there is no adequate way to describe the plot without spoiling it.You will either be frustrated with its asymmetrical and manipulative storytelling or be captivated by scattered clues that ultimately lead to some kind of resolution.The title is an oblique nod to Shakespeare and also a clue to the films cosmic pretensions. Youre not just supposed to see Seven Pounds; youre supposed to embrace it. How far you go along with this will likely depend on how quickly you figure out whats going on. It took me about half the movie and I was curious until that point. Once the truth kicked in though the exercise became more one of marking time than awaiting fulfillment.Seven Pounds seems like a European or Asian movie with its abrupt edits disorienting close-ups and a piano score that sometimes chooses cacophony over symphony. A pet jellyfish is freighted with symbolism.Im inclined to give the picture passing marks for two reasons. The first is that in reuniting with The Pursuit of Happyness helmer Gabriele Muccino Smith isnt preaching to the converted. Even more than with his misunderstood superhero from last summers Hancock hes not trying to make us love him. This is no small risk for Hollywoods most genial superstar.The other reason is Smiths acting and that of co-star Rosario Dawson. Its deeper than weve seen from either of them and they click. We have no reason to like his character (hes rude and moody) or to totally trust hers but we feel as drawn to them as they do to each other.Smith plays Ben Thomas a man who is either a U.S. government taxman or a top executive for a private aerospace firm. He drives a fast car has a beautiful wife and lives in Malibu. Everything is going well until we become aware that something has not gone well. In fact it totally changed his life.""In seven days God created the world"" he says in voiceover. ""In seven seconds I shattered mine."" Note the use of that number again.The ominous statement comes early in the movie. So does a scene where Thomas calls 911 and reports a suicide. When the operator asks who the victim is Thomas replies ""I am.""How could he be telling the truth? Is what happens next all in flashback or is it fantasy? The only thing that seems certain is that Thomas is on some kind of quest. Hes stalking people for reasons unknown. The truth is out there as Fox Mulder would say. When it finally arrives you will either yawn or slap your head in amazement. But you should end up admiring Will Smith. For once he hasnt chosen the easy or safe path.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Will Smith in ""Seven Pounds."" Photo Merrick Morton Sony Pictures Movie review Will Smith in Seven Pounds 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Seven Pounds Drama. Starring Will Smith and Rosario Dawson. Directed by Gabriele Muccino. (PG-13. 118 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Will Smith is interested in emotional pain now in the dark side of American life in people who are sad or sick or just plain unlucky and hes found a partner in the Italian director Gabriele Muccino. The team collaborated on ""Pursuit of Happyness"" a 2006 film that told the true gutter-to-riches story of a brilliant talented man who still almost fell through societys cracks. Their new film ""Seven Pounds"" is a spiritual successor to ""Pursuit"" but darker and more oblique. In fact the movie is so roundabout and cryptic that it takes half the running time just to figure out the general nature of whats going on. ""Seven Pounds"" makes a mystery of its lead character and of what hes pursuing and for a very simple reason If the movie were to announce its subject and story in the usual straightforward way it would seem so ridiculous far-fetched and borderline distasteful that no one would want to watch it. It might even seem funny. So Muccinos task is clear if difficult - to generate enough magic and to work up just the right mood so as to cast a spell on viewers. That way when the movies intentions and meaning are finally made clear nothing will seem discordant or strange. All will make sense. For the most part Muccino accomplishes this precise balance that Grant Neoportes screenplay requires. Going in all we know about Ben (Smith) is that something terrible has happened in his past and that he feels responsible for it. Thats all. Everything else we gradually piece together through a fractured narrative that jumbles the time sequence. We learn that he is an IRS agent. Later we see that he does field audits but audits of a very particular and repugnant kind. He seems to specialize in hounding people for back taxes when theyre in the hospital sometimes with serious illnesses. Theres anger in this guy. In one scene he talks on the phone to a food companys customer service representative (Woody Harrelson) and when he finds out the man is blind he goes ballistic and starts taunting him making withering demeaning remarks and shouting into the phone. Obviously this is not the usual Will Smith and that difference is half the appeal of ""Seven Pounds"" to see a familiar screen presence show new sides of himself. Smith has made a point of stretching in recent years. Even in the title role of ""Hancock"" which was in most ways a routine action movie Smith had to build a character different from his usual rambunctious action persona tapping into reserves of sorrow and disillusionment. But he goes much further in ""Seven Pounds."" His breeziness becomes a shallow act and his smile becomes downright eerie a strained mask that hides pain wards off hostility and expresses aggression all at the same time. Its a smile with dead eyes. Throughout ""Seven Pounds"" has a distinct quality. The pensive score the subjective cinematography and even the muted aspect of the featured performances all contribute to a sense of being trapped inside a waking dream or nightmare. Ben leads a hollow existence a death in life and the people with whom he comes into contact are the forgotten who have dropped out of the world. Enjoyment of ""Seven Pounds"" rests entirely in how one reacts to the romance that develops between the austere IRS agent and Emily (Rosario Dawson) a graphic artist suffering from congenital heart failure. Some will cry foul say its too much that the movie turns maudlin. But for those who find themselves on the films wavelength this is love at the edge of the universe. This is the kind of thing that inspires people to write operas. Dawson with her strident but delicate beauty is worthy of operatic treatment. ""Seven"" shows once again that she has it in her to be a powerhouse even as it showcases a sweetness and vulnerability she hasnt shown before. Dawson who played Mimi in ""Rent"" and Edward Nortons girlfriend in Spike Lees ""25th Hour"" is ready to take her place as a major screen actress. In the end the most appealing thing about ""Seven Pounds"" is the element it shares with Smiths more cheerful movies It affirms life as something enormous and important not small not meaningless but monumental and worthy of big statements. -- Advisory This film contains disturbing images.

"Seven Pounds | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; seven-pounds ) Seven Pounds (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The primary goal of Seven Pounds is to make viewers weep and it pursues that aim with a doggedness that is almost commendable. The film manipulates shamelessly and despite defying logic with its contrivances and unconvincing character portrayals will succeed in getting many audience members to the point where tears are inevitable. Yet theres no cinematic equation that relates the need for tissues to motion picture quality. Seven Pounds works better the more the viewer feels and the less he/she thinks. On an emotional level one could decree that the movie is satisfying. On an intellectual level its disappointingly shallow. The story is told in a non-linear and seemingly haphazard manner that confounds and confuses as a means to hide a ""twist"" until late in the proceedings. Unfortunately despite their zeal to obscure the main characters central motive the filmmakers miss the mark - one doesnt have to be Sherlock Holmes to divine the films ultimate trajectory within its first 30 minutes (especially since the movie opens with one of the final scenes). Since this isnt a thriller recognizing the destination is less of a detraction than a minor distraction. The bigger problem is trying to put oneself into the mindset of the lead character who is acting largely because thats the way he has been written. Yes guilt is a powerful motivator and the quest for redemption can be obsessive but it would be helpful if the protagonist could pursue these objectives in a manner thats consistent with believable human behavior patterns. Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is an IRS agent. We know from his flashbacks that at one time he was (literally) a rocket scientist. He lives alone but from those same flashbacks we know he was once involved in a committed relationship. Ben has a list of seven people he is apparently auditing. He visits one Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson) while shes in the hospital being treated for congestive heart failure. Shes on a transplant waiting list but she has a rare blood type and chances for her long-term survival arent good. Ben informs her that she owes back taxes but hell do something with the paperwork to give her a few months reprieve. He moves on to other clients but his thoughts keep returning to Emily. He visits her home. He slips into her hospital room at night and gazes at her. Meanwhile Ben has moved out of his beach house and into a seedy motel room. His only companion is a pet jellyfish. Hes a strange person but we understand that his past is marked by an unrevealed tragedy and he is seeking a way to make the rest of his stay on earth meaningful. And that means helping people and perhaps not just by fudging their tax returns. Seven Pounds demands a bigger leap of faith than some viewers will be capable of making. Ben more closely resembles a Biblical icon than an individual. Seen objectively some of his actions which are presented as benevolent have a cruel side. Either director Gabriele Muccino doesnt realize this or chooses to ignore it. Ben is deeply disturbed perhaps even clinically insane but Seven Pounds chooses to present him as a man on a mission. In a way this is French art film territory but there are no subtitles and the lead actor is one of Americas biggest and brightest stars. If nothing else Seven Pounds raises legitimate questions about the lengths to which it is reasonable for someone to go to achieve redemption. Are some sins so grave that they can never be expunged? (See The Reader for a more profound and disturbing examination of this question.) Can guilt and pain be confused and does the alleviation of one lead to a release from the other? And can acting in the ""best interests"" of another confer upon them a burden that they are unable to accept? The last question which may be the most unsettling is sidestepped entirely by the movie. In its quest for closure and catharsis it doesnt want such messy strands left dangling. In the midst of all this angst can be found a tender love story and therein lies Seven Pounds core of strength. The affection that develops between Ben and Emily is touching and heartfelt and it keeps the movie from spiraling into a pretentious abyss. There are a lot of things in Seven Pounds that feel artificial but the quiet moments these two spend together are genuine. Will Smith and Rosario Dawson sell the relationship. It has meaning. Theyre both deeply wounded in their own ways and that adds to the intensity of their scenes together. This is Smiths second appearance for Muccino. His previous effort The Pursuit of Happyness had a similar grim serious tone. Muccino who came to Hollywood from Italy plainly sees more in Smith than most other filmmakers do. Yet arguably the actors greatest strengths are his likeability and charisma and to strip him of them as Muccino does here may be doing Smith a disservice. His scenes with Dawson flow but there are other sequences in which is performance is awkward and unconvincing although this may have something to do with the screenplays overplotted quality. I believe Muccinos intention with Seven Pounds is to make a spiritual uplifting motion picture but I found it to be uncomfortable and depressing. Seven Pounds is an interesting experiment in Oscar-baiting but while it may make viewers cry it doesnt achieve its loftier aims. In fact the message with which I departed the theater was more prosaic than philosophical put away the cell phone when driving.

Well say no more.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted December 19 2008Seven Pounds is one part jigsaw puzzle one part The Giving Tree and both parts marinated in melancholy. For most of the movie its director Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happyness) offers shards of narrative daring us to fit together the jagged pieces. Which is also what his protagonist Ben Thomas (Will Smith uncharacteristically heavy-hearted) is doing only first hes picking them up. In a forlorn voice-over Ben says that while the Lord created the universe in seven days that he Ben destroyed his world in seven seconds. The film offers glimpses of what Benworld looked like - a lushly landscaped Malibu villa overlooking the Pacific - while carefully withholding explanation of how it came to be shattered. (There will be no spoilers here.) The movie spends the next 100 minutes working backward (also sideways and forward) until it divulges the Precipitating Incident by which time it has thoroughly bewildered and/or alienated the better part of its audience. Seven Pounds is an edgeless version of 21 Grams a similarly themed and similarly fragmented film about casual and causal relations. In both films the narrative hopscotching has the unintended effect of impeding the audience from bonding with its characters. All the moviegoer knows is that Ben evidently an auditor for the Internal Revenue Service has a caseload of delinquents with medical issues. And that his work has taken him to a forlorn motel in the San Fernando Valley light years from that fabulous Malibu villa. One of Bens cases is ethereal Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson a beauty with compromised health like her character Mimi in Rent) who has congestive heart failure. The films most engaging sequences (and the only ones told in straightforward narrative) are those where Ben investigates Emily and like the rest of the audience finds her irresistible. Smith and Dawson previously co-starred in Men in Black 2 and have a nice way of looking both starry-eyed and wise-eyed when theyre together. So yes Seven Pounds is in part a romance. The love story is not limited to that between Ben and Emily but additionally - and self-importantly - incorporates that between a penitent and his self-prescribed penance. It is hard to write about Seven Pounds while preserving its narrative surprises. So I will say only this For me the films melodramatic messianism overwhelmed its excellent question How do we atone for our wrongs? Narratively morally cinematically Seven Pounds is a case study in overkill. Seven Pounds (Out of four stars) Directed by Gabriele Muccino written by Grant Nieporte photography by Philippe Le Sourd music by Angelo Milli distributed by Sony Pictures.

Seven Pounds (PG-13) Columbia (122 min.) Directed by Gabriele Muccino. With Will Smith. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. ONE AND A HALF STARS ""Seven Pounds"" is not an easy movie to write about. Partly thats because the film sets itself up as a dont-spoil-it mystery from its title to its characters motivation. Why is nice Will Smith going around doing all these favors for strangers? And what is he really trying to fix in himself by going to such lengths to help them? I cant tell you. Mostly though ""Seven Pounds"" is not an easy film to write about because that central mystery is precisely whats wrong with it. In its attempts to conceal its ""twist"" -- although I honestly saw through it halfway through -- it twists itself into knots. And when it does reveal all it all seems frankly unbelievable. Thats a shame because star Will Smith is one of the most believable and likable stars around and his last project with director Gabriele Muccino was the heart-tugging ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" Having them reteam for another story about a desperate soul sounded promising. But what seemed fresh then has lost some of its shine by now and a few of that earlier movies flaws -- a knack for picking just the wrong pop tune for the soundtrack an inability to make a specific setting feel like anything more than an anonymous location -- have only grown in size. Getting through a precis of the plot without enraging the ""No spoilers"" crowd isnt easy but suffice it to say that Will Smith plays a fabulously wealthy aerospace engineer -- who for some reason is now living in a motel and apparently working for the IRS. He uses government databases to identify seven worthy needy people. And then he shows up in their lives to help make a difference. Its a bit like the old ""The Millionaire"" -- but adorned with deluded self-righteousness. Because although Smith is clearly meant to be playing some sort of saint hes really a bit of a jerk -- taunting and abusing a blind man just to see how ""good"" he really is leading a wounded young woman on when they clearly have no future together. The whole thing ends in whats meant to be a spectacular act of selfless generosity -- but really plays as mad messianic egoism. Its not unlike an even worse movie a few years back ""The Life of David Gale"" in which two activists engineered a suicide (and a wrongful execution) simply to protest the death penalty. Come to think of it ""Gale"" was a Kevin Spacey movie made when -- tired of so brilliantly playing the smirking villain -- the actor had switched to playing poor put-upon martyrs. Now Smith -- apparently weary of so smoothly playing the hip hero -- has followed his lead wanting only to play the generous good soul. The struggling father of ""Pursuit"" the misunderstood superhero of ""Hancock"" the self-sacrificing doctor of ""I Am Legend"" and now this karmic philanthropist -- even when theyve been shadowed by guilt or anger theyre all tiresomely superior why-cant-you-be-more-like-me human beings. And its beginning to get dull. Wheres the dead-cool Big Willy who sucker-punched an alien in ""Independence Day""? The get-jiggy-with-it joker who came close to cracking up even Tommy Lee Jones in two ""Men in Black"" movies? I dont know but I wish this fellow would ditch the halo and go looking for him. These days we dont need another plaster saint. But cocky optimists? We never needed them more. Ratings note The film contains adult subject matter.

The only mystery here is how many people are actually going to pay good money to watch this preposterous romantic melodrama which uses a fractured narrative to cloud an absurd plot that would probably be laughed off the screen if it were presented in a straightforward manner. Smiths reunion with director Gabriele Muccino (the far more tolerable ""The Pursuit of Happyness"") is basically ""Pay It Forward"" meets ""Babel."" The star whose self-grandiosity has grown exponentially in each recent succeeding role - he turned out to be literally a god in ""Hancock"" - has finally surpassed his pal Tom Cruise in the ego department. POP VIDEO QUIZ Will Smith The worlds biggest star (Smith that is) plays an extremely depressed IRS agent who goes around looking for seven people to help in a very major way. At one point he gives away his oceanfront estate to a battered mom - its up to us to figure out how this poor woman is going to be able to afford the astronomical real-estate taxes. Before I get to the spoilers - very soon - I dont think Im giving away too much by revealing that one of his beneficiaries is a beautiful but dying heart patient played by Rosario Dawson. Those of you who have seen the trailer - or thought about exactly what the title means - maybe have already figured out the gruesome vaguely O. Henry-ish twist here and there are additional clues in the first 20 minutes. But if you really insist on seeing ""Seven Pounds"" against my best advice God bless - and PLEASE STOP READING NOW. REALLY. GO AWAY. Because Im going to have to reveal some ""secrets"" to take a scalpel to this baby. The sad truth is that if you laid this movie out chronologically - and maybe if you dont - not a whole lot of it makes any sense. Smith is just posing as an IRS agent - hes an aerospace engineer who was behind the wheel in an automobile accident that killed his wife and six strangers. After a while of moping around he donates a kidney to his ailing brother (Michael Ealy) - the real IRS agent - and decides that donating organs is a gift that keeps on giving. How Christmas-y. If this sounds like one of those unbearable Robin Wiliams movies from the late 90s well its morose New-Agey philosophizing is not all that far removed from ""What Dreams May Come."" Im not really sure exactly who will enjoy watching Will Smith take his life with a poisonous jellyfish in an ice-packed motel bathtub even on cable TV at 3 oclock in the morning. But if thats really necessary for this suicidal savior to save Dawson at the end of ""Seven Pounds"" then what is he doing with her in the final fantasy scene? Guess he got over the beloved wife he accidentally killed and brooded over for two previous hours. Loves a bitch and then you die. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next DVR TOP TEN LIST Read Next DVR TOP TEN LIST Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 46195 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20783 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash 17005 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Columbia Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday December 18 2008 722 PM Wondering if ""Seven Pounds"" is a movie for you? Heres how to tell Are you the person who forwards inspirational e-mails to all your friends? Would you watch Will Smith in absolutely anything? Do you still sniffle when you think about him on that train in ""The Pursuit of Happyness""? If the answer to all of the above is yes youve just made your Friday night plans. Were not going to tell you what that mysterious title means but youll probably figure it out pretty early on. Smith is Ben Thomas an engineer haunted by a terrible mistake he made years ago. As penance hes determined to aid others in the most meaningful ways imaginable. One of the people he wants to help is Emily (Rosario Dawson) a sad-eyed cardiac patient. Posing as an IRS agent Ben becomes involved in her life to find out if shes worthy of the gift he hopes to give her. Though he pretends to be interested in an audit hes soon walking her dog weeding her garden and sitting by her bed at the hospital. Even as Emily falls in love with him she has no idea who he really is - or that hes also helping six other strangers including a blind telemarketer (Woody Harrelson) and an abused mother (Elpidia Carrillo). Director Gabriele Muccino who made ""Happyness"" cant see past his (frankly questionable) concept. By unfolding Bens secret slowly through flashbacks and ominous hints he loses the chance to turn his hero into someone we understand. Bens apparent selflessness rings false making him the sort of one-dimensional saint youd find only on screen. Saintliness is a heavy burden to carry and Smith cant help but buckle a bit. Hes always interesting to watch but crafting a real person out of his cardboard character proves an impossible task. Instead its Dawson who focuses this muddled movie matching Smiths charisma - no small feat - while adding some essential earthiness. Youll have plenty of time for your mind to wander; feel free to spend some of it imagining what this imposing pair could do with the right material. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Its goal is to stir rouse reach deep into your guts and leave you shaken and upset -- yet hopeful. Because its story of atonement and accountability relies on slowly unfolding secrets much of what follows will be vague. Its clear from the opening moments that Will Smith is playing a man whose emotional gyroscope is badly damaged. Ben Thomas behavior is baffling and somewhat sinister. He lives in a seaside California villa its austere Asian-inspired ""W Hotel"" look accented with an eerie accessory a jellyfish aquarium. Something is out of whack. Just what is wrong and how Thomas aims to put it right is the point of the disquieting story. Flashing credentials as an IRS auditor he interviews several people whose cases intrigue him. He grills them about their lives smiling with his teeth while holding them in a judgmental gaze seemingly less interested in their Schedule C forms than their immortal souls. He probes into areas of their lives that rarely concern tax agents illness domestic abuse dashed hopes the way they treat others who depend on their care. We learn that he intends to intervene in the destiny of several strangers significantly altering their lives. To what end we dont quickly learn. The man and his mission remain mysterious for much of the film. Thomas taunts a milquetoast customer-service operator (Woody Harrelson) and roughs up a nursing home administrator. His expression conveys anger tinged with despair; his best friend (Barry Pepper) is deeply worried about his state of mind. He was once in love and when he meets a terminally ill tax delinquent played by Rosario Dawson that feeling begins to dawn again. She is a good-hearted woman with a failing heart. Thomas sense of estrangement begins to evaporate in the face of her warmth his chilly restraint thaws and his sense of purpose begins to wobble. The man who set out to remake seven lives starts to reassess his own. His sense of purpose was shattered and late in the day he begins to question his furious battle to put it back together. ""Seven Pounds"" reteams Smith with Gabriele Muccino who guided the actor to an Oscar nomination as a homeless job-seeker in ""The Pursuit of Happyness."" Once again he puts Smith in a melancholy drama with redemptive themes and follows him to new emotional depths. Like the earlier film ""Seven Pounds"" trades on themes of instability and loss that resonate with many viewers. Life liberty and cheerful pursuits feel like quaint mementos of a naive past age. The precariousness of all we hold dear is drummed into our heads in a 24-hour news cycle. SEVEN POUNDS  out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic material some disturbing content and a scene of sensuality. ""Seven Pounds"" translates this tension into a story of romance suspense and tragedy. Muccino fractures the story in modernistic style an appropriate way to depict Smiths troubled psyche. The film presents disconnected snippets of his perplexing behavior and challenges us to weave it all into context. When we finally discover the trauma that triggered Smiths quest it feels conventional and a bit contrived but the script is tough-minded about how things would pan out for a man in his situation. The acting ensemble is skillful. Smith is compellingly grim and vulnerable as the alienated antihero; he has deepened as an actor and his talent radiates from the screen in every frame. Dawson gives a blessedly natural performance and has the knack of looking beautiful without ever appearing glamorous. ""Seven Pounds"" takes their relationship somewhere unexpected. Its not a standard romance but a parable about how a good persons effort to do the right thing can blur the lines between right and wrong. When we finally see the story in its full outlines we have a lot left to think about.

Will Smith portrays an IRS worker trying to atone for a deadly mistake in Seven Pounds. Photo Sony Pictures Seven Pounds 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Viewer beware. Seven Pounds is being hawked as an uplifting message flick for the holidays a Will Smith vehicle that pushes home the importance of giving at the grabbiest time of year. Stricken man seeking redemption for a deadly error gives everything he owns to decent folks in need. Deep isnt it? A tiny bit Capraesque? Sure except for that funny word ""everything."" Except for the fact that the poor schnook is convinced that in order to redeem himself he kinda sorta maybe has to die. And that means Im sorry to say that the hoodwinked holiday movie crowd may wind up rooting for a suicide. Well isnt that jolly. Exactly what we need this time of year Go ahead and knock it back with a glass of eggnog but just make sure its spiked. Thats about all I can say without giving away several plot twists. Id be happy to give away every last one of them if the movie were a total crock but it isnt. Almost but not quite. It has Will Smith for one thing and I have long believed in the inherent watchability of anything hes involved in except maybe Wild Wild West. It also has the determined humanistic viewpoint of director Gabriele Muccino who worked with Smith in The Pursuit of Happyness -- a by-the-bootstraps allegory of a homeless father pursuing the American dream. Seven Pounds takes the opposite tack Its the story of a widower giving all that he owns away systematically paring himself back to nothing. ""Live life abundantly"" he says and the charge resounds like a blessing. His quest seems so holy and pure -- Byzantine sainthoood through mortification revamped for the 21st century -- until it crashes head-first into the nagging realities of grief and love. Theres nothing romantic about depression or altruistic about suicide no matter how noble the man considering it. Its not a selfless act; its a tragedy. But Muccino and screenwriter Grant Nieporte (a TV scribe from 8 Simple Rules ...) go for the mawkish gotcha at every opportunity turning what could have been a touching portrait of loss into a morbid collision of Its a Wonderful Life and Love Story. At the center is Ben (Smith) our grieving protagonist a mystery man with IRS credentials and a file full of people in trouble. In it are Ezra a blind pianist played by Woody Harrelson and Emily a dying beautiful lonely impoverished worthy did-I-mention dying young printer played by Rosario Dawson -- another inherently watchable actor. Ben and Emily are of course made for each other and might of course pursue some happiness down the road were it not for her congenital heart failure and his profound depression. Among the movies truly affecting moments are the scenes between these two their soft conversations about living and dying his efforts to fix the letterpress in her garage. Smith and Dawson exhale warmth and affection with every breath. But the authenticity of their bond and the hope they generate in each tender scene makes the films loony central plotline seem all the more obviously false. The story opens as Ben calls 911 to report his own suicide so we know what were up against I guess. Yet his chosen method is absurd. Its meant as some kind of grand poetic gesture (beauty and death together again) but I cant imagine a more ghoulish or labor-intensive approach to killing yourself. It also strikes me as medically bonkers I am not sure its possible for Ben to end his life as he wants to end it and still accomplish what he wants to accomplish when its over. While I cant say exactly what happens I will tell the film closes on a meeting between two characters thats now wayyyy high on my list of weirdest moments in cinema. It is I think supposed to be touching. And this is supposed to be a holiday movie.

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED December 17 2008 at 1055 am | UPDATED May 6 2016 at 1142 pm Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Chris Harris INT injuries and 8 other observations from Day 2 of Broncos training camp Broncos offensive line can live with the blame game. Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Seven Pounds"" begins with anguish -- and no small amount of arrogance. IRS agent Ben Thomas sits on a bed gripping a phone. Hes on the line with 911 reporting a suicide. Whose? His own. Moving back and further back in time this death-and-the-taxman tale starring Will Smith delicately reveals how Ben arrived at this crucible. With the stinginess of a well-paced thriller ""Seven Pounds"" reveals the event that set Ben on a completely different course. Whatever the tragedy -- and the audience can guess parts of it -- it came with loss and a load of guilt. ""In seven days God created the world . . . in seven seconds I shattered mine"" Ben confesses early on. Still its not a disastrous accident but the obsessive quest Ben undertakes in response to make seven strangers lives whole that provides the movie its sentimental hook. In a season of heavy-hitting awards contenders featuring A-list performers a weighty start to a studio flick is hardly a shocker. But directed by Gabriele Muccino the film isnt about awards sniffing. Its goal is more old-fashioned than that. ""Seven Pounds"" is a star-driven heartstring-tugger committed to finding affirmation amid despair. If redemption comes with a little romance so be it. Rosario Dawson is Emily Posa one of the people on Bens list. Barry Pepper plays the friend and lawyer charged with finding the right recipients for Bens generosity. A wedding planner with a bad heart Emily is in and out of hospitals when Ben enters her life. Hes come to audit her (so he pretends) at the worst possible time. Relegated most often to kick-butt roles in graphic-novel fare (""Sin City"" and ""Grindhouse"") Dawson does nice work playing wary but curious. After all initially Ben seems more stalker than suitor. Not unlike its protagonist ""Seven Pounds"" is a fractured tale. The pieces dont fit neatly together. Why for instance is this IRS agent so affluent? Why does he bully a blind telemarketer (Woody Harrelson) then turn into the furious champion of an old woman in a nursing home? When Michael Ealy shows up as Bens concerned -- if rebuffed -- brother some questions are answered. New ones arise. With its fragmented storytelling and evocative title the movie courts comparisons to ""21 Grams"" another film in which a tragedy is pieced together over time even as a love story unfolds. ""Seven Pounds"" written by Grant Nieporte is kinder-gentler going -- sort of. The films remarkable final act makes ""Seven Pounds"" a laudable example of a studio flick taking to heart its responsibility to entertain and engage. Ben is not an easy character to inhabit. For all his altruistic impulses he is not a ""nice"" guy. Summers superhero saga ""Hancock"" also tried to cut against the grain of Smiths smooth persona. Occasionally the actor grimaces with the effort of depicting a character whose torments run deep but whose sense of entitlement is a second skin. Striding through various spaces -- a hospital an assisted-living facility a run-down motel -- its clear hes used to getting his way. Much as they did when they teamed up for 2006s ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" Smith and director Muccino trust audiences to follow them to unexpected -- even uncomfortable places. Yes ""Seven Pounds"" shares some appreciated lessons about love and loss and sacrifice. But the filmmakers also offer a moral about moviegoing too Not all holiday cheer need come in broad comedic strokes to warm the multiplex throngs. ""Seven Pounds"" PG-13 for thematic material some disturbing content and a scene of sensuality. 158 minutes. Directed by Gabriele Muccino; written by Grant Nieporte; photography by Philippe Le Sourd; starring Will Smith Rosario Dawson Michael Ealy Barry Pepper and Woody Harrelson.

Comments Seven Pounds Will Smith has fame fortune and a beautiful family but thats not enough--he wants you to know what a beneficent guy he is too. In this contrived hunk of feel-good he plays an IRS auditor who runs around doing extravagant good turns for people he grants a delinquent taxpayer a six-month extension moves a battered woman and her children into his vacant oceanfront home even donates bone marrow for a dying man without asking for anesthetic. Of course anyone this saintly must be atoning for some foul crime in his past but when screenwriter Grant Nieporte finally discloses what it is after an endless tease it hardly merits the characters self-flagellation. Gabriele Muccino (The Pursuit of Happyness) directed; with Rosario Dawson Woody Harrelson Michael Ealy and Barry Pepper. PG-13. By J.R.

Starring Will Smith Rosario Dawson Woody Harrelson Michael Ealy Barry Pepper Director Gabriele Muccino Running time 153  Editorial Review Its difficult to gauge exactly how much to say about ""Seven Pounds"" a film whose chief pleasure -- and it is a powerful one -- derives from the essential mystery surrounding the films enigmatic title. What weighs seven pounds? And what does it have to do with the seven strangers sought out by the obviously troubled IRS agent Ben Thomas (Will Smith) who opens the film with this portentous voice-over narration ""In seven days God created the world. In seven seconds I shattered mine."" Its a mystery that wont remain much of one for long given the Internet chatter the trailers the celebrity interviews. Not to mention the fact that critics like me have to write about the damn thing. But I will try to do so without spoiling it for the people who want to walk into the theater as I did knowing as few specifics about this movie as possible. Who is Ben Thomas? Early on we see him conducting what can only be called at best unorthodox audits and at worst harassment of people who owe money to the feds. Ben comes across as part stalker part con man posing creepily inappropriate questions one minute and then sweet-talking the next. Hints are given slowly that something tragic has happened to him. Something that affected seven other people. And that now hes trying to make it right. The movie is pretty unabashed about the all-but-corny sentiment Each of us has something to give. Its lucky Smith is such a good actor that he makes the characters contradictions a strength not a weakness. Its one of the clearest portrayals of a characters doubt and ultimate resolution Ive seen in a good long while. You see Ben isnt really the son of God after all. Or even very much of a hero. Hes just a man. And when it comes right down to it the film asks isnt that hard enough? -- Michael OSullivan (Dec. 19 2008) Contains disturbing thematic content bloody imagery and a scene of sensuality.

ABOUT THE MOVIESeven Pounds  1/2 out of fourStars Will Smith Rosario Dawson Woody Harrelson Michael Ealy Barry PepperDirector Gabriele MuccinoDistributor Columbia PicturesRating PG-13 for thematic material some disturbing content and a scene of sensualityRunning time1 hour 58 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY It takes a while to sort out and piece together the parts in Seven Pounds. And though it all makes sense by the films end the process can be slow going. A romantic mystery of sorts Seven Pounds re-teams Will Smith and director Gabriele Muccino who worked on 2006s The Pursuit of Happyness. Not much can be revealed about the movie without spoiling the surprises. But we can say that Ben Smiths enigmatic character begins by compiling a list of seven names. What each has in common is a critical need for help. Ben comes to their aid in extraordinary and dramatic ways. Why he has chosen to help them is initially murky. The process of sussing out the source of his altruism could try some peoples patience. Moments of confusion arise as the story ricochets between past and present and among the cast of characters. Still it is an engrossing if plodding tale of redemption and sacrifice. The film opens intriguingly with Ben calling 911 to report a suicide his voice an odd blend of distress and matter-of-factness. The plot takes turns in various directions building up to the crucial matter of the suicide. One of the people Ben helps is Emily (Rosario Dawson) an easygoing artsy woman with whom he slowly falls in love. Dawson and Smith have an appealing chemistry. None of the other story lines are as involving particularly one involving Ezra (Woody Harrelson) a good-natured pianist. Ben initially derides the man who has a day job in sales as ""a blind vegan beef salesman."" His chunk of the story could definitely have used some beefing up. Smith gives an understated performance. Hes less the genial Everyman of his comic films and more of a brooding lost soul. He may be driven mostly by guilt rather than generosity. Seven Pounds is the kind of holiday film that seems perfectly suited to these economic times with desperate people in dire need of cash medical intervention and proper housing and a conflicted hero who decides almost grimly to improve their circumstances. Concerned with how people overcome trauma and tragedy the film focuses on universal themes of loss forgiveness and redemption While it doesnt break any new ground or provide any revelations Seven Pounds is unabashedly emotional and cautiously hopeful. Its the feel-good movie for these feel-bad times. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

A movie that like ""The Sixth Sense"" depends entirely upon the payoff for its impact ""Seven Pounds"" is an endlessly sentimental fable about sacrifice and redemption that aims only at the heart at the expense of the head. Intricately constructed so as to infuriate anyone predominantly guided by rationality and intellect this reteaming of star Will Smith and director Gabriele Muccino after their surprisingly effective ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" is off-putting for its manifest manipulations as well as its pretentiousness and self-importance. All the same the climax will be emotionally devastating for many viewers perhaps particularly those with serious religious beliefs meaning theres a substantial audience out there for this profoundly peculiar drama if word gets around. Everything including the title the ad campaign and a good portion of the film is designed to give away absolutely nothing about the true nature of the picture. Melodramatic opening scene plays like something out of an old film noir like ""D.O.A."" as a man (Smith) calls 911 to report a suicide. ""Whos the victim?"" the operator asks. ""I am"" the man replies whereupon theres nowhere to go but to a film-long flashback to reveal whats gotten him to this point. Thus begins first-time screenwriter Grant Nieportes narrative sleight-of-hand designed to keep the audience onboard for a long ride while offering just enough of a hint that an intriguing revelation awaits at the end of the line. Hes better at the latter than at the former; for at least the first half of the film none of what you see makes much sense or possesses any particular dramatic import. Carrying an ID card from the U.S. Dept. of Treasury Smiths Ben Thomas circles some names on a printout. One is blind phone salesman and pianist Ezra (Woody Harrelson) while another is Emily (Rosario Dawson) a young woman with an enlarged heart who will need a transplant soon if shes to survive. Its hard to know how to read Ben during this phase; the way he insinuates himself into other peoples lives gives him something of the air of a hustler or con man and his contentious phone relationship with his brother (Michael Ealy) raises questions of its own. On the other hand Ben appears anxious to please his directness and soft-spoken urgency betokening a genuineness of intent. Before long an appealing tenderness enters into his relationship with Emily that ultimately blossoms into a full-blown love story something that fills out a great chunk of the running time. Given Emilys vulnerability Bens gentle patience with her Smith and Dawsons attractiveness the lushly intimate widescreen images devised by Muccino and lenser Philippe Le Sourd and Angelo Millis literally incessant button-pushing score ""Seven Pounds"" offers either seductive emotional appeal or indigestible mawkishness according to taste. Along the way there are references to a fatal vehicular accident suggestions of Bens deceptiveness and inscrutable imagery of a jellyfish which you may be sure all factor crucially in the denouement. Whether one entirely rejects the projects high-minded game-playing or falls right into the filmmakers quasi-spiritual trap and is thereby helplessly reduced to a jellyfish-like state at the end its impossible to claim that Muccino and Nieporte lack the courage of their convictions or faith in the moral value of their contrived little sacrificial fable. Nor can it be said that Smith whose most recent box office barn-burners ""I Am Legend"" and ""Hancock"" seemed consciously designed to set the star apart from the rest of humanity shies away from the saintlike status conferred upon his character. Indeed he embraces it in a way so convincing that it proves disturbing as an indication of how highly this or any momentarily anointed superstar may regard himself.

Its almost impossible to say because screenwriter Grant Nieporte and director Gabriele Muccino go to great lengths playing with time while dropping small clues to keep whats really going on here a secret. I wont spoil it. But its fair to say that its a film about redemption about atoning for mistakes in extreme ways about love and loss. And if that sounds like a generic recipe for melodrama well exactly. Yet Will Smith is so good in the central role of a man trying to redeem himself that it forgives many of the sins of the screenplay. Smith plays Ben Thomas a man who is troubled happy despondent and industrious depending on which version of him we see at the time. (Hint Unshaven equals unhappy.) In an early scene Ben mercilessly berates a blind vegetarian telephone meat salesman (Woody Harrelson) for no apparent reason. He dodges calls from his brother (Michael Ealy) who makes cryptic references to something hes missing that Ben might have. Ben obviously understands what hes talking about; the audience does not. There are occasional mysterious meetings with Dan (Barry Pepper) his best friend since childhood. There are visits to hospitals; one of them is where we meet Emily (Rosario Dawson) who suffers from congenital heart failure and has a rare blood type which makes a transplant difficult. Ben ostensibly following her to check into various failures to pay her taxes seems to have an ulterior motive. And sure enough the two fall in love the relentless Ben weeding her yard and repairing her ancient printing press. Meanwhile Ben inserts himself into the lives of other people including a battered woman (Elpidia Carrillo) to whom he gives a substantial gift. Why is he watching a tough old man (Bill Smitrovich) coach a kids hockey game? Whats going on here? Dont fret; eventually Muccino pulls all of the various threads together. You may guess at aspects of where things are leading perhaps even the ultimate outcome. But the details will surprise you. So will Smith. Seven Pounds requires a good deal of patience on the audiences part. Its a puzzle and not all of its pieces are equally compelling. It would be easy to turn away. The constant is Smith (though Dawson also is good). He holds the screen whenever hes on it which is almost all the time. Luckily while Ben could be played as maudlin Smith avoids that. An innately likable actor Smith manages not to overplay the heavy emotional scenes which would have been easy enough to do. Instead he gives Ben an edge. Clearly the man has issues more than we initially realize. But what causes them? Sometimes Muccino gives a few hints that are too obvious. Others are confusing though eventually explained. Bit by bit the jagged timeline comes into focus. Your level of satisfaction by the end will depend greatly upon how emotionally manipulative you like your movies. Seven Pounds is more than willing to use all the tricks of the trade - swelling music that sort of thing - to make you reach for the tissues. But its only Smiths performance that makes the tears worth crying. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Seven Pounds -- 4 out of 5 stars Will Smith plays Ben Thomas an IRS agent with a fateful secret who embarks on an extraordinary journey of redemption by forever changing the lives of seven strangers. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic The rules for a weeper a movie tear-jerker could not be simpler. Touch us. Make us fumble around in the dark for a Kleenex. But earn those tears.Seven Pounds is a weeper wrapped in a mystery centered on an enigma. But whatever pains cast and crew go to preserve its mystery the movies tears are righteous as is its message. Ben Thomas (Will Smith) is a serious sad-faced stranger who walks into peoples lives like some sort of angel. The first piece of the puzzle Is he the Angel of Death or a guardian angel?Bens an IRS agent so he has access to peoples entire lives. He shows up unannounced and interviews folks -- interrogates them actually. Hes tactless a little rude. Theyre in arrears on their taxes upside down on their mortgages in failing health or leading lives limited by circumstances beyond their control. Who is he? What does he want? What is his mission?""No questions"" he fires back to one and all.Emily (Rosario Dawson) is one who wont take that for an answer. She has congenital heart failure. Shes deep in debt. And this callous fed seems to be stalking her seeking to discover as he does with a blind musician (Woody Harrelson) kids hockey coach (Bill Smitrovich) or nursing home operator (Tim Kelleher) if shes a ""good person.""Smiths Pursuit of Happyness director Gabriele Muccino working from a script by TV writer Grant Nieporte  gives us enough glimpses to guess the big mistake that Ben is atoning for in meeting these people and studying their lives. And since the opening moments of the film are a 911 call we know where this might go if love joy or happiness dont intervene. But forget the puzzle the cryptic touches and the bracingly sad little music montages that Muccino packs in as filler. Seven Pounds sinks or swims on the Ben and Emily connection; Dawson (Eagle Eye The 25th Hour) rarely used on film in this way simply will not let it sink. She lets the camera see what Ben sees in her eyes the good humor and hope that mask the weariness of a deadly illness. Harrelson and Barry Pepper (playing Bens best friend) make the case that they each deserve more work than Hollywood offers. Smith usually plays such awards-bait roles with a sullenness that robs him of his movie-star qualities. Not this time.Its not a masterpiece but Seven Pounds is perfect in at least one way -- its timing. An emotional movie at the most emotional time of the year it works to keep its secrets. But more importantly when the tears do come it has earned them.

Writing at the time I praised the film for Smiths superb performance and for its willingness to honestly address the social and economic realities of Americas underclass. Watching Smith and Muccinos latest collaboration Seven Pounds I marveled (to paraphrase the great Jermaine Jackson) that something so right could go so wrong.One key member of the Pursuit creative team who hasnt returned for the encore is Steve Conrad the gifted screenwriter whose refreshingly unsentimental script for the earlier film helped to keep things rooted in a street-level grit even in light of plot developments that were straight out of fairy tale. For Seven Pounds Smith and Muccino are instead working from the first produced screenplay by Grant Nieporte a TV-sitcom writer whose most significant contribution to popular culture thus far (depending on how you rate his episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch and 8 Simple Rules . . . for Dating My Teenage Daughter) was as an idea man for the ubiquitous ""Tool Time"" segments on that early-90s ratings juggernaut Home Improvement.The sitcommers gift for concocting 22-minute solutions to complex problems is in full evidence in Seven Pounds a morbid morality play that rivals The Reader for the bottom spot in this seasons celluloid martyrdom derby. The movie begins with Smith framed in coldly lit close-up phoning 911 from a fleabag Los Angeles motel room to report his own imminent suicide and for most of the next two hours Seven Pounds maintains that anguished overwrought tenor. Sure there are requisite flashbacks to cheerier times for Smiths character Ben Thomas an IRS tax collector with what at first glance seems an incongruously palatial oceanside home (unless Ben has been picking Uncle Sams pocket). But even then a thick funereal mist clouds the air. We know from quite early on that Ben is a haunted man that he once had a beautiful wife and a more glamorous job--cue yet more flashbacks--but that his picture-perfect life came to an abrupt end in one of those tragic incidents that characters in Oscar-baiting non-linear movies wear on their chests like scarlet letters. Seven Pounds could have been called The Pursuit of Misery.What exactly happened to Ben is less significant than what he plans to do about it. So we are subjected to one scene after another of him making house calls on delinquent taxpayers and other unfortunate souls--a blind telemarketer (an uncomfortable-looking Woody Harrelson) a hospital administrator in need of a bone-marrow transplant a battered housewife in need of an escape from her thuggish husband. These scenes arent so much encounters as auditions in which Ben like some creepy Dickensian Christmas spirit sizes up each candidate and determines whether he or she is a ""good"" person and if so deserving of Bens charity. Just what he has to give is the ""secret"" upon which Seven Pounds pivots--a secret that if we knew it from the start would make the movie seem even more preposterous than it already does.Dispiritingly obvious and phony from top to bottom Seven Pounds is the sort of movie in which romance rears its head in the form of an angelic young woman with a literal broken heart (Rosario Dawson doing her best in a thankless role) and the poisonous jellyfish our hero keeps as a pet is milked for maximum Chekhovian portent. Its also the first time in many films that Smith is less than captivating.Over the past decade the former rapper and TV star has matured into one of the most appealing leading men of his generation graced with a rare ability to invest an elemental human fragility into his portrayals of everymen and supermen alike. Thus Smith would seem a logical choice to star in a movie about the actual ways in which actual people deal with actual grief and loss and to some extent thats exactly what he did last year in I Am Legend. There for all the CGI accoutrements the main attraction was Smith himself giving a bracing fully dimensional portrayal of a rational man brought low by despair and impotent rage. In Seven Pounds cast as another widower gripped by life-changing emotions hes altogether less convincing in part because the movie is doggedly intent on making the character into a Christ figure and Smith is so much more compelling as a flawed mortal. Ben Thomas suffers all right but the audience suffers more.
