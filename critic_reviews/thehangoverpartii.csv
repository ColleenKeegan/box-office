By David Denby Reunited Ed Helms Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis.   Credit Illustration by KIRSTEN ULVE This we know Men truly madly deeply want to get married. This we also know Men truly madly deeply dont want to get married. Those eternal contraries were key to the 2009 comedy smash ""The Hangover"" and they are again in ""The Hangover Part II"" which replicates the characters the structure the hallucinatory deliriums and the terrors of the first movie though with somewhat less fizz. Again there is a wedding in the offing with a bachelor party that nearly wrecks the day. This time its Stu (Ed Helms) the square and logical dentist whos about to enter a state of bliss. Hes marrying a beautiful young woman Lauren (Jamie Chung) in a ceremony at a beach resort in Thailand paid for by her wealthy Thai parents. Stu doesnt want another insane night of revelry like the last time when Doug (Justin Bartha) got married. He doesnt want to have his life turned upside down or so he says. Does he mean it? He and Doug and the two other members of the ""Wolfpack""--Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis)--go for a drink on the beach taking along the brides brother Teddy (Mason Lee) a sixteen-year-old genius attending Stanford. Then somehow while Doug stays behind the rest wind up spending the night in utmost debauchery and wake the next day incapable of remembering a thing--this time in a sordid hotel room in Bangkok. Teddys not there but in a bowl of water the others find a finger with his ruby-red Stanford ring on it. ""The Hangover"" has the physical freedom and the wildness of a great silent comedy though heaven knows none of the innocence. ""The Hangover Part II"" isnt a dud exactly--some of it is very funny and there are a few memorable jolts and outlandish dirty moments. But it feels at times like a routine adventure film set overseas. There is a car chase through a city market a boat racing past green mountains on the coast many bright colors and much scenery all of it vaguely reminiscent of a James Bond film though one featuring men rather less suave than Sean Connery Roger Moore or Daniel Craig. No one I suppose can blame Todd Phillips the director of both movies for trying again. Phillips and the first set of screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore did something brilliant in ""The Hangover."" They showed us not the long night of vice but the longer day after it when the men stone-cold sober are forced to realize with increasing horror what they have done to the world and to themselves in the preceding twelve hours. The filmmakers knew that scenes of drunken and druggy carousal are just as boring to watch in movies as in life but that throat-clutching anxiety mounting in shrill hysteria to the point of breakdown can be riotous and engulfing. The movie is a comedy of rationality struggling for control. It resembles of all things a police procedural with the increasingly battered men (the previous evenings participants keep showing up to settle scores) piecing together the events from bizarre clues. In ""The Hangover Part II"" the men again seeking to find out what atrocities they have committed run afoul of thugs hookers and various other denizens of Sin City East. Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) the gangster from the first film turns up and Jeong recapitulates his naked obscene casually sinister turn. The two movies offer a comedy of types a kind of Freudian allegory with Bradley Cooper enacting the ego Ed Helms the superego and Zach Galifianakis the id. Or to put it more simply aggression caution and stupidity. Part of the fun in ""The Hangover"" is the mens amazed discovery of one anothers capabilities. This time however theres little surprise in Coopers double takes at Galifianakiss enraging naive-child responses. And though no one could have predicted the exact nature of Stus misadventures in Bangkoks sex underworld we already knew from the first movie that he has a thing when drunk about whores. Stu as the man who most completely embodies ordinary male confusion is the center of the two films and Helms is at his frenzied best when he tries to exert logic in the most chaotic situations and then giving up stiffens his back whirls his arms and shrieks in frustration. Looking at him you understand Todd Phillipss idea that every man buries within himself and wants to liberate a lord of misrule. In obedience to this alleged need both movies plunge precipitously through levels of taste morality common sense and caution finally reaching a subterranean miasma of infantile need flesh organs and drool. When youve seen the bottom in the roll of photographs running next to the credits at the end of each movie youve seen more than you want to see. Though somehow I think it unlikely that the spectacle will stop anyone from trying to go even lower. ""Submarine"" a delicate and potent new British comedy is narrated by the reedy precise speaking voice of a fifteen-year-old smarty-pants named Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts). Oliver who lives in the Welsh coastal city of Swansea isnt nasty but hes a spy and a manipulator often dishonest not always brave and for all his intelligence apt to misunderstand events and get into ridiculous situations. In other words he could be any of us as a teen-ager only hes more active and articulate. ""Submarine"" is based on the 2008 novel by Joe Dunthorne which is set in the late nineteen-nineties but the writer-director Richard Ayoade moved the story back to a strange distant time of typewriters and tape cassettes--perhaps the early eighties. Ayoade shifted the time frame I would guess because he wanted to make hand-delivered notes a major feature of the story. Oliver tells us that he has two projects to end his virginity before he turns sixteen and to keep his parents marriage together. A born writer he sends many missives all of them inappropriate. Our own view is that his parents marriage is doomed but he thinks that an extraordinary fellow such as he deserves a family. Ayoade formerly a music-video director and TV comedian sweetly satirizes the boys endless self-absorption. Oliver thinks that he can change the world with his fantasies and he creates Super-8 movies in his head which we see. One film is about the devastation wrought upon his school by his premature death weeping girls in uniforms gather in miserable groups while a sensitive local newscaster microphone in hand speaks of ""incredible unprecedented scenes of devotion."" By using the voice-over centrally Ayoade can jump from Olivers school to his parents house and then to the open scraggly fields and the coastline outside Swansea. He dispenses with conventional establishing shots and even connecting shots. Olivers narration tells us what we need to know. And Ayoade in addition to showing us the movies in Olivers head gives us touching visual essays on his preoccupations such as the incomprehensible nature of his mother (Sally Hawkins) who is prim anxious and hypocritical (shes having an affair with the New Age sex hustler next door) and the equally puzzling depression of his father (Noah Taylor) a slender bearded marine biologist who is so quiet and passive that he might as well be living underwater with the fish he studies. ""Submarine"" moves quickly but its precise and often very witty with a persistent lyrical flow that evens out the sharp brief scenes. Oliver runs down to the sea whenever he can; sometimes he tells us he waits for a darkening sky to equal his morose moods. All of nature reflects his inner life. The movie has some of the ease and the gently antic spirit of Richard Lesters ""A Hard Days Night"" (1964); indeed that movie may be an explicit reference point. Craig Robertss full black hair is cut low covering his forehead in the style that the Beatles made famous. Roberts has dark liquid eyes and he can hold your attention without doing much on the surface; hes one of the rare naturals who can convey the impression of mental activity with just tiny shifts of expression. The female participant in Olivers virginity-loss project--sometimes eager sometimes balky--is his schoolmate Jordana (Yasmin Paige) who has the same hair and bangs and the same liquid eyes. They are soul mates like Papageno and Papagena; Jordana is just as clever as Oliver but with a small streak of cruelty that he finds mesmerizing. She makes him kneel when at last she offers him a kiss under a railway bridge. A natural ironist she hates sentiment and is happiest when looking at grim industrial scenes or setting stuff on fire such as the hair on the legs of boys she likes. In all this is a movie that is partial to youth as a state of being. The grownups seem finished as frozen in their lifetime roles as creatures out of myth or the Bible. But Oliver and Jordana have the freedom to go anywhere do anything become anything. ""Submarine"" is an exhilarating surprise.

""It happened again."" Thus begins Todd Phillipss The Hangover Part II the sequel to his box-office-crushing 2009 comedy. Again Phil (Bradley Cooper) is on the phone to Tracy (Sasha Barrese) the last films nervous bride-to-be. Again he is explaining that he and fellow ""wolfpackers"" Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) have on the eve of a wedding managed to lose a member of the wedding party during an apocalyptic boys night out--a night of which again they can remember nothing. From that unlucky phone call we will again rewind the clock to follow the amnesiac investigators as they try to piece together what happened. And once again less probably the journey is hilarious. Despite its slavish fidelity to the structure of its predecessor Phillipss sequel manages to take each plot twist and twist it further. The wedding this time is Stus and the lost wolf--more a cub really--is the 16-year-old brother of his betrothed Lauren (Jamie Chung) whom she unwisely left in the packs care. As Laurens family is Thai the wedding has been relocated from L.A. to a Southeast Asian resort and the boys contingent debaucheries from Vegas to Bangkok. This time in place of a baby and a tiger Phil et al. find themselves the bewildered custodians of a wizened monk and a chain-smoking monkey. (His French inhale is something to behold.) Rather than a pulled tooth this outings unremembered self-mutilation involves an amputated finger. And as for the sex-worker with whom otherwise mild-mannered dentist Stu has a fling--well lets say shes rather more exotic than Heather Graham and leave it at that. The Hangover Part II is of course crass and violent and profane in the manner of contemporary R-rated comedy. But to a greater degree than the first film--itself already a bit of an outlier--there is an underlying ferocity even cruelty to the proceedings in place of the shit-and-vomit humor often encountered at this end of the MPAA spectrum the gags here tend to involve fatal overdoses and graphic sexual intrusions. Indeed the comedy is not just black but noir--which is apt given the formula to which Phillips has adhered so rigidly. The missing person the seamy urban setting the gradual accretion of clues The Hangover films are essentially hard-boiled crime stories spun into comic depravity heirs as surely to Hammett Chandler and Cain as they are to Apatow and the Farellys. This was central to the appeal of the first movie. Even as it found room for scenes with taser-happy schoolkids and Mike Tyson singing ""In the Air Tonight"" there was an uncommon meticulousness to its structure It succeeded not only as comedy but in its way as mystery. The formula works less well in the sequel. In part this is because the plotting is looser; in part because the gags and performances--Galifianakiss in particular--have grown broader; and in part simply because unlike the first movie this one doesnt have the chance to come at you sideways to surprise with its novel model of comedy. Its a testament to the strength of that model though that despite its derivative nature and other shortcomings The Hangover Part II is brutally funny. Again.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip. A sleepiness that overtakes the body slowly but surely and feels entirely outside of your control.

By Peter Rainer Film critic May 26 2011 Save for later Saved In this publicity image released by Warner Bros. from left Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms are shown in a scene from The Hangover Part II. Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros. Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of When I recently compared ""Bridesmaids"" to ""The Hangover"" I wasnt being altogether complimentary. Now that Ive seen ""The Hangover Part II"" I must apologize to the ""Bridesmaids"" people. By comparison their movie is ""Citizen Kane."" I can understand why this sequel to ""The Hangover"" exists. That movie was no masterpiece either but it was intermittently laugh-out-loud funny and more to my point it made about 500 million. Its follow-up not surprisingly doesnt mess much with the template but theres a disturbing shift in tone This one is darker and scummier to no real purpose. Set in Bangkok where life apparently is cheap the sequel has straight-laced dentist Stu (Ed Helms) preparing for his nuptials with his Wolf Pack Phil (Bradley Cooper) Doug (Justin Bartha) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) in tow. Thailand is the home country of Stus fiancee (Jamie Chung) whose father is not a fan of the marriage. (In a prewedding toast he compares the groom to boiled white rice which sounds about right actually.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Despite Stus efforts to avoid what happened at Dougs bachelor party in Las Vegas - i.e. ""The Hangover"" - things quickly take a turn for the wild side. The plot such as it is turns on a severed finger belonging to the fiancees brother Teddy (Mason Lee) and a chain-smoking capuchin monkey (mercifully the smoking was CGI). Paul Giamatti seething his lines turns up as an apparently shady businessman. Stu finds himself with a facial tattoo a la Mike Tyson. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gallery The top 10 highest-grossing films Throughout it all director Todd Phillips and his co-writers Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong provide thudding action film sequences that are anything but funny and not all that well staged either. Its as if the filmmakers were hungover from the first film and wanted to make a violent action movie instead. This is the same thing that happened to the ""Beverly Hills Cop"" franchise which quickly turned into something more suitable for Sly Stallone than Eddie Murphy.I realize that its beside the point to take seriously anything that happens in ""The Hangover Part II."" Still I cant dismiss the ugliness behind many of its antics. Teddy for example is touted as a promising classical cellist and future surgeon. Why is his losing a finger supposed to be such a laugh riot? I guess you had to be there. But really dear moviegoers you dont have to be at theaters playing this movie.

But images also persist in our memories and continue to move us in mysterious ways. Many of those in Terrence Malicks exquisite and also exasperating new film--his fifth in a career spanning four decades --are remarkable for their grandeur billowing volcanoes churning geysers hissing fumaroles spiral nebulas seen through the eye of the Hubble space telescope. Others are notable for their grandiosity When ""The Tree of Life"" goes over the top it sets altitude records. Some of the most memorable images though are the most fleeting curtains curving gently in a breeze; a newborns tiny foot surrounded by a fathers hand; a mothers lyrical dance of joy; a father switching off the night-table light in his young sons bedroom. ENLARGE Brad Pitt meets a new arrival in Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life Fox Searchlight Tiny and vast eternal and evanescent these are the polarities of a work of art that defies categorization. (Mr. Malicks long-standing defiance of mainstream conventions surely helped his film win the top prize last weekend at the Cannes Film Festival.) Reduced to its essence ""The Tree of Life"" is a free-form meditation--strongly but not literally autobiographical--on the life of a family in small-town Texas in the 1950s. Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are the husband and wife identified only as Mr. and Mrs. OBrien. Hunter McCracken is Jack the oldest of their three sons. (Jack is played as an adult by Sean Penn.) The three central primal portraits--father mother first-born child--are astonishingly vivid especially since theyre not conventional performances; the dialogue is sparse and the script dispenses with plot and overt conflict. (Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography ranges from creamy softness to stark majesty. Jack Fisk did the fine understated production design.) What we learn about this family--a lot--comes mainly from thoughts and supplications conveyed in voice-overs and revelatory moments of sweet pleasure hovering menace (how did any of us survive the daily dangers of childhood?) repressed anger explosive rage and through it all bewilderment and grief provoked by a sudden tragedy. Much of the film bespeaks the adult Jacks struggle to understand his mortal journey. What happened to the innocence of childhood? How did his beloved mother endure the pain that came to define her life? Before and after everything else who was the father he loved deeply and hated implacably? (In an admirably minimalist way Mr. Pitt gives equal weight to the fathers tyranny and thwarted dreams.) Jack is not the only questioner. Mr. Malick uses his film to ask the sort of existential questions that he has posed in such earlier works as ""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" Why does misfortune befall good people? How can faith be sustained in the face of tragedy that is by nature incomprehensible? What of God? Where do we belong in the raging indifference of the cosmos? To set the larger context--larger being a colossal understatement--the film gives us a long sequence the likes of which hasnt been since Stanley Kubricks ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" (with special effects by Douglas Trumbull the same wizard who conjured up Mr. Kubricks marvels). Successive segments look back to lifes beginnings--this tree has really deep roots--and out to the rings of Saturn the moons of Jupiter and the infinitude that surrounds us paying special attention to violent creation and violent destruction. You do not come out of this film feeling like the king of the world. How you feel about that sequence may depend in part on your response to nature photography. As it started to unfold I was glad to let go of the family drama long enough to take in titanic vistas on a big screen. And I was touched by the technical simplicity of one particular glimpse of life even though the cumulative effect is somewhat ponderous; theres nothing like Mr. Kubricks stunning metaphor of the ape flinging up a bone that becomes a space station. But the film takes a far more problematic turn in a coda that expresses Jacks quest with surreal images of seeking and finding his way of reunion and reconciliation on a higher plane. Some will find this inspirational; as the last shot ended a woman in my audience called out a passionate ""Amen"" Others will react as I did with dismay --not because of the codas unabashed spirituality but because the banality of its images blurs the beautiful originality of whats come before. Yet ""The Tree of Life"" finds its own way taking nourishment from the grandeur and more than surviving the grandiosity. Daring in concept occasionally daffy in execution and ultimately unforgettable Mr. Malicks film offers a heartfelt answer to the question of where we humans belong-- with each other on this planet bound by love. Watch a clip from ""Kung Fu Panda"" starring Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. ENLARGE The hero of Kung Fu Panda 2 Warner Bros. Pictures Kung Fu Panda 2 The invention of fireworks quickly leads to gunpowder in this lively DreamWorks sequel and then to a secret weapon that threatens the hero with irrelevance or worse. ""How can kung fu stop something that stops kung fu?"" asks Po plaintively. Hes the borderline-obese panda turned Dragon Warrior in the first episode and hes got his paws full once again as an evil peacock tries to take over China. No need to worry about him though and no need to wonder why ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" the directorial debut of Jennifer Yuh Nelson is so consistently entertaining. The movies not-so-secret weapon is graphic design. Hardly a scene goes by that isnt visually striking or kinetically thrilling and all of it enhanced by 3-D. The most spectacular set piece is what amounts to a chariot race through the alleys of a medieval city but the costumes and landscapes are sumptuous too and hooray for the idea that when orphaned Po dreams of finding his parents he does so in 2-D. The script could do with more dimensions; theres a surfeit of therapy-based stuff about lost love self-esteem and letting go of the past. Whenever the film lets go with an action sequence though its time to be grateful for computer animation and to keep both eyes peeled for incoming cannonballs. The highly anticipated sequel to The Hangover was released Thursday. ENLARGE The Hangover Part II brings back the original bemused gang in a Thai adventure. Dreamworks The Hangover Part II Its not a good sign that the frenetic denizens of this sequel to the 2009 hit comedy keep declaiming variations on the theme of ""I cant believe its happening again."" I wouldnt say that ""The Hangover Part II"" is a carbon copy of the original but only because no one knows about carbon paper any more. I cant believe how precisely everything does happen again except that what was fresh and surprising in Las Vegas turns rancid and predictable in Bangkok where yet another wedding is scheduled to take place. (The director as before is Todd Phillips.) This time the groom-to-be is Stu the dentist played by Ed Helms who is likened by the scornful father of his Asian bride to white rice pudding. Mr. Helms gets to do a funny riff on that description toward the end but its one of the few bright spots. Bradley Coopers formerly engaging Phil has grown vulgar and unpleasant Zach Galifianakiss Alan dispenses mirthless insults at every opportunity and Ken Jeongs effeminate gangster Mr. Chow is given much more screen time than before with even less justification. Not everything is slavishly duplicated though. Instead of waking up in a Las Vegas hotel room to find a baby the hung-over buddies wake up in a Thai hotel room to find a capuchin monkey. Make Believe Terrifically likable without trying too terribly hard J. Clay Tweels documentary follows six teenage magicians to Las Vegas where they seek the title of Teen World Champion in a competition that draws hopefuls from around the world. The title doesnt do justice to the film which is starting to play in theaters around the country. These talented dedicated kids arent making believe about anything--theyre making art out of shimmering illusion intricate manipulation and blithe misdirection. (In magic as distinct from filmmaking misdirection is a good thing.) Among the contestants are a boundlessly articulate and fatefully beautiful young woman from Malibu Calif. and a tender tentative boy from Japan who isolated in his rural village created his act and his performing self out of whole silk. Why one succeeds and one fails is a mystery more compelling than any we see on stage. DVD FOCUS Badlands (1973) Terrence Malick based his debut feature on a 1958 string of murders across the West by Charles Starkweather and Caril Ann Fugate. In his fictionalized--and aestheticized--version Martin Sheen plays Kit the psychopathic killer and Sissy Spacek is Holly his 15-year-old girlfriend who narrates flatly yet hypnotically. (Warren Oates is Hollys father.) Brilliantly controlled and singular in style the film has come to be viewed as masterly and the soullessness at its core as a commentary on American culture. Tak Fujimoto did the ravishingly desolate cinematography. A Little Princess (1995) Emmanuel Lubezki shot this enchanting film with all the warmth he brings to ""The Tree Of Life."" (Look at the color and the quality of the light for a better understanding of why cinematographers were previously called lighting cameramen.) Alfonso Cuaron directed from an adaptation of the Frances Hodgson Burnett novel by Richard LaGravenese and Elizabeth Chandler. Liesel Matthews is Sara Crewe the young girl forced into servitude at a boarding school in New York when her father fighting with the British forces in World War I is presumably lost in action. Its Kind of a Funny Story (2010) Zach Galifianakis is Bobby a patient in a psych ward whos as mysterious as he is funny and touching. Think of this small smart film as ""One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest"" blissed out on Wellbutrin. Its the saga of Craig a depressed teen who checks himself into a Manhattan hospital and ends up surrounded by thats right screwy people. Craig is played by Keir Gilchrist from ""United States of Tara""; hes got a sweet spirit and a cockeyed Paul Simon smile. The directors were Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck; they adapted the screenplay from Ned Vizzinis young-adult novel. --Joe Morgenstern Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Most Popular Articles Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Donald Trump Lashes Out at Michael Bloomberg Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

"The Hangover Part II A lot like The Hangover Slate Sign In Sign Up The Hangover Part II A lot like The Hangover The Hangover Part II A lot like The Hangover Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 26 2011 542 PM The Hangover Part II technically but whats the difference? By Dana Stevens Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis in Hangover Part II The Hangover Part II (Warner Bros.) isnt so much a sequel to The Hangover as a slightly blurred copy. Directed like the wildly successful first film by Todd Phillips it airlifts the original characters premise and story structure out of Vegas and plonks them down in Bangkok in near-identical form save for a few instances of ante-upping. Several years after their Vegas bachelor party turned into a 48-hour nightmare involving drug-laced drinks a prostitutes missing baby and near-fatal encounters with both Mike Tyson and his pet tiger the four friends meet again in Thailand for the wedding of Stu (Ed Helms) a seemingly straight-laced dentist to Lauren (Jamie Chung) a nice pretty Thai girl. (Id provide a more precise description of Lauren but thats all the movie gives me to work with Shes Thai pretty and nice or as one of Stus buddies put it ""an angel with a solid rack."") Advertisement Besides the bridegroom Stu the gang includes Phil (Bradley Cooper) a handsome family man with a taste for debauchery; Doug (Justin Bartha) a bland foil who hangs around waiting to take expository phone calls; and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) a socially underdeveloped weirdo who explains his living situation as follows ""Im a stay-at-home son."" Once again Alan has been invited along only out of grudging politeness; the other guys are creeped out by his overeager insistence that their shared experience in Vegas has bonded them forever. The night before the wedding for reasons that arent revealed until much later an innocent round of beers around a beachside fire leads to another rabbit hole of amnesia and poor decision-making. The boys wake up the next morning in a grimy Bangkok hotel room amid various clues to the previous evenings excesses Theres a clothed monkey a severed finger in a bowl of melted ice and a coked-up Asian gangster (Ken Jeong) who remembers them from Vegas. Worst of all one of their cohort--the brides naive 17-year-old brother Teddy (Mason Lee son of the director Ang Lee) has gone missing. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The rest of the movie spirals chaotically yet formulaically into the depths of the Bangkok underworld. Tattoo parlors are visited transsexual prostitutes consulted Buddhist monks rescued from drunk tanks all in the service of finding Teddy in time for the upcoming wedding. Individual lines here and there are funny (most of them Galifianakis) and Ed Helms has perfected his outraged splutter but this film never achieves the anarchic liftoff the first one did. I didnt love The Hangover--it fell apart a bit in the second half and none of these performers thrills me to my bones--but even in its weaker moments that film had more comic integrity than this blatant cash grab. The Hangover Part IIs big taboo-breaking set piece (every summer comedy is required to have one now by order of the Ministry of Tastelessness) comes when the boys meet a ""ladyboy"" sex worker who claims to have provided services to one of them. The degree of horror displayed by the men when s/he reveals a set of unambiguously male genitalia is more than a little off-putting. Our heroes have at this point faced with equanimity the prospect that a teenage boy may be hurt and irretrievably lost in the squalor of the Bangkok underworld. Is the fact that one of them may or may not have had consensual gay sex really the worst possible thing they can imagine? In case its not obvious the R-rated Hangover Part II is not suitable for children (a fact ignored by a couple of morally challenged parents at the promotional screening I attended.) Its raunchy violent offensive to every conceivable interest group and liberally laced with profanity and male nudity. The whole point of this franchise is to make even jaded adults laugh in shock at the outrageous behavior on display. This strategy works best in the final credit sequence which in another shameless lift from the original reveals in a series of rediscovered snapshots what happened on that one wild night in Bangkok. That minute and a half of still photos packs in more dense economical laughs than all the laborious gross-outs and chase sequences that came before. Maybe The Hangover Part III should consider restricting itself to the slide-show format. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

It isnt a typical sequel either a watered-down encore or a muddled and overstuffed extension.It is in some very clever ways a sendup of those kinds of sequels; it does not shy away from the demands of what it is and what it has to do. The Hangover Part II The first Hangover was the original one-off a thrill ride of a comedy about a group of guys engaging in the quintessential young-man rite of passage a Vegas bachelor party.On its way to becoming the top-grossing R-rated comedy eventually raking in more than 250 million at the box office it became clear that there would be a sequel. But what does that mean? What could a second Hangover be other than another bachelor-party fantasy-nightmare that according to the rules of sequels is bigger faster stronger than the first?The answer Phillips and company came up with is to hold to the same spirit that drove the first movie a punk-rock-styled fearlessness an anarchic willingness to do whatever and go wherever the fear and laughter took them. Reunited with the first movies core cast -- Ed Helms (Stu) Zach Galifianakis (Alan) Bradley Cooper (Phil) Justin Bartha (Doug) and this movies MVP Ken Jeong (as the indelible Mr. Chow) -- Phillips has created a movie built on the understanding that viewers have seen the original Hangover countless times.Thus the sequel occurs on a parallel track Its the same only different. It shares the same structure. This movie opens with a bedraggled Phil making the phone call to let the frantic bridal party know that ""it happened again."" ""It"" of course means that Stu Alan and Phil once again have awoken from a pills-and-liquor blackout dazed and confused with one man missing in action. In a clever play on sequel conventions The Hangover Part II contains all the same plot points and comic-suspense beats as the first but with different twists and tweaks for the viewers to spot and sort out. It becomes a kind of game Its Bangkok instead of Las Vegas. Instead of the groom disappearing its the brides little brother. Instead of a tiger its a monkey. Instead of pulling out your own tooth its cutting off your own finger. The ER doctor is now a tattoo artist; the guy who ran a wedding chapel is now a strip-club operator.And so on. But rather than just remaking the first movie Phillips takes this sequel darker and deeper. The Hangover Part II succeeds in the same way the first Hangover did by presenting images and events that are simultaneously hilarious and horrifying. Then it was Holocaust jokes and clowning around with a guy who just might be a child molester. Now its a bunch of stuff I dont want to talk about because a) theres no way to talk about it that is even PG-rated and b) any hint of what happens lessens the jolt factor that is an essential part of the Hangover experience.This is a harder dirtier uglier movie than the first one but thats what it has to be to stay true to the punk ethos driving it. From the use of the great Johnny Cash song ""The Beast in Me"" to Stus heroic rant about the demon inside him Part II digs into the dark desires that drive peoples actions from deep inside in a way that is simultaneously really funny and truly disturbing.Like the first movie this one is full of images and dialogue that will soon be ubiquitous pop-culture references such as Alans wistful farewell to the monkey ""I wish monkeys could Skype ... maybe one day."" Another trait Part II shares It is designed to reward multiple and even compulsive viewings. As the old pollster slogan goes see this movie early and often.The Hangover Part IIB+ Starring Ed Helms Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis Ken Jeong and Justin Bartha. Directed by Todd Phillips.

We have found a few lately such as ""The Help"" (wondeful awesome movie - youll laugh cry hoot and holler) but it has been hard to find any others that were really worth anything. I am going to rent these two for out next ""movie night"" and Ill let you know what I think. Thanks for sharing these Danielsaid on Sunday June 19 2011 84838 AMyou know you really know how to explain where these movies fail. This movie seems more like a prototype than anything else. Good job Roeper. dereksaid on Friday June 17 2011 13709 PMroeper you are out of your mind . this movie is better than the original if you did not find this funny then you do not have a sense of humor sorry. The Jakesaid on Tuesday May 31 2011 105851 AMSome of you that hate this movie make me look forward to seeing it even more today. Usually if I have nothing but negative things to say about a movie - I dont go and pay to see the sequel of that same movie. Bottom line is that it made over 100 mil in the first weekend so Id say a few more people then you think gave it a thumbs up. Id liked the 1st one and personally am glad they didnt change the plot - too many directors try to get too creative with changing things and ruin sequels - Jaws 3 / Halloween 3 for example. Just sayn Karensaid on Tuesday May 31 2011 103849 AMThese movies are just simply not funny. Perhaps if youre in high school and unaware of reality maybe i can see that these movies show you a part of life you have not yet experienced. But as for adults i would expect you to demand clever intelligent unique humor when spending your hard earned money for something. There is nothing clever or witty about the first or second of these so called ""comedies"". Lomaxsaid on Tuesday May 31 2011 24852 AMWhat made the first movie so funny was that it was chaotic and (at least in my opinion) not formulaic as so many comedies are. They also took a familiar scenario and catch-phrase ""what happens in Vegas..."" and pumped it up to the max. This new one is neither as chaotic (its the same 3 guys the same scenarios etc.) nor as familiar (theres nothing iconic about having a hangover in Bangkok). The irony being that the stuff that happens to them is much worse. They lose a 17 year old kid who cuts his own finger off for some reason Phil gets shot and Stu had gay sex with a Transvestite who could very easily have given him an STD. Stu could marry 10 Jamie Chungs and it wouldnt make up for that fate. Disappointedsaid on Tuesday May 31 2011 11751 AMGreat review Mr. RoeperI agree with virtually everything you had to say about the film. They should have taken a different direction with this to show versatility; now for a third everyone will be expected the same thing yet again. Things just didnt seem well thought out for example (Spoilers) no one seeming to care much that the cherished teenagers future career will be ended for no good reason (End Spoilers). Overall just felt like a lazy cop-out. Richard Roepersaid on Monday May 30 2011 112532 AMMr. Tuttle Your ""kissing Eberts ass"" comment is pure bullshit. Did you not watch ""Ebert amp; Roeper""? We argued about movies every week. There was no ass-kissing. Also I recorded my review three days before Roger posted his. So how would I know he would even bring up the photo in question? Best Richard Charlottesaid on Monday May 30 2011 72114 AMIf the 2nd one sucks so much because it is a copy of the first one - maybe you all should go back to the first one and realize that that one already sucked big time. Strange to think you could actually go even more lowbrow lazy and more unfunny. I am afraid to think about what level of crudity is left in Phillips mindset for the 3rd. Samsaid on Monday May 30 2011 50112 AMWow The Hangover 2 was terrible. I didnt laugh once and all the stuff in bangkok has been done a thousand times already. It had a so-what flavour.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Zach Galifianakis has the body of a troll the woolly face of a hermit and the spirit of a sprite. He does not in other words look sound or act anything like a conventional movie star. Galifianakis fits the Falstaffian fat-guy archetype embodied by the late John Belushi but theres something legitimately unhinged at his core that lends the seedy new lowbrow sequel The Hangover Part II its vague not entirely earned air of danger and transgression. The Bangkok setting also contributes The city filmed by Lawrence Sher as a smoldering hellhole with a rapacious appetite for foreigners innocent and otherwise does half the films work; the rightly vaunted chemistry between Galifianakis Ed Helms Bradley Cooper and to a much lesser extent Justin Bartha does the rest leaving the filmmakers with little to do but stick to a winning formula. Cooper Helms and Galifianakis return as friends who reunite for Helms wedding in Thailand. The trio promises to take things easier following their mishaps in Vegas but their good intentions lead to a nightmare morning-after following a crazed bachelor party gone awry. Theyre left with troubling questions Where and how did Helms acquire a Mike Tyson-style face tattoo? How did the gang hook up with a cigarette-smoking dope-dealing rock n roll burnout monkey? Most importantly where is Helms preppie brother-in-law-to-be and why is he apparently separated from his finger? Like the original The Hangover Part II takes the form of a backward mystery as the boys--they are unmistakably boys whatever their age--retrace their steps and try to figure out the path leading to their desperate state. The filmmakers cant recapture the originals novelty or freshness so they up the raunch level considerably; the matter-of-factness of the transsexual and gay-panic jokes is almost progressive. Still The Hangover Part II is never as edgy as it imagines itself to be. Bangkok may swallow innocents whole but director Todd Phillips has a lucrative franchise to protect so the films flirtation with the comic abyss gets compromised into something that looks more like a rock-solid mainstream comedy with a prominent dark side.

GAYLE MacDONALD The Globe and Mail Published Thursday May 26 2011 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 241PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Director Todd Phillipss modus operandi when crafting the The Hangover Part II was clearly thus If it aint broke dont fix it. So he doesnt throw in a new thing opting instead to recast the same players follow the identical concept and dish out dialogue that shocks and is funny in parts but nevertheless lacks the raunchy wit of its hard-to-top predecessor. Movies The Hangover II The official trailer Crystal the monkey poses at the premiere of ""The Hangover Part II"" at Graumans Chinese theatre in Hollywood California May 19 2011. The movie opens in the U.S. on May 26. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters video Video Hangover 2 monkey madness The Hangover II video Video Bradley Cooper gets another hangover Phillips cant be blamed for falling back on a formula that made the first Hangover such a huge success in 2009. It ranked as the No. 1 R-rated comedy of all time earning more than 467-million (U.S.) worldwide. Opening Thursday just ahead of Memorial Day weekend in the United States this film is projected to make more than 100-million - possibly up to 120 million - at the domestic box office earning it yet another distinction as the first R-rated film to do so. If that happens no doubt Part III will soon be in the works. But the original films magic lay in the fact that it delivered the totally unexpected. Audiences were blown away by the hilarity that ensued when the ""wolf pack"" (Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis) descended on Las Vegas for Dougs (Justin Bartha) botched bachelor party only to wreak havoc. And they were smitten by the undeniable chemistry of a cast who were then relative unknowns particularly the warped man-child known as Alan played to perfection by the scene-stealing Galifianakis. The Hangover made the actors A-list Hollywood stars. But despite the indisputable talent of this cast The Hangover Part II doesnt deliver the same zany punch of its predecessor. This time the boys have gathered in Bangkok for Stus upcoming nuptials to the lovely Lauren (Jamie Chung). The ever-cautious dentist still scarred from his tooth loss and shotgun marriage to a hooker (she was a ""sweet lady"") in Vegas he eschews a bachelor party in favour of a bachelor brunch. A crushed Phil gets the groom-to-be to agree to have at least one beer on the beach. The next morning the hapless threesome wakes up to find themselves in a fleabag Bangkok hotel. Alan is hairless. Stu sporting a face tattoo is curled up in a tub. And all that remains of Laurens 16-year-old brother Teddy (Mason Lee) who had joined them on the beach is a finger chilling in ice on a nightstand. Back is the requisite blackout and quest to retrace their steps of the night before. But instead of carting around a sunglass-wearing baby the boys are saddled with a chain-smoking drug-dealing capuchin monkey. They also get reacquainted with Ken Jeongs Mr. Chow whose role has been expanded and retired heavyweight Mike Tyson. There are no cameos from Bill Clinton or Mel Gibson but Paul Giamatti is wonderful as a local crime lord seeking payback from the effeminate Mr. Chow. The high-speed car chase doesnt disappoint. The soundtrack is as eclectic as the first. The ending credits are as X-rated as before. And a scene in a strip club is jaw-dropping if not slightly scarring. The script by Phillips along with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong is undeniably funny in parts but the salacious spark and brilliant pacing of the original is off. The Hangover Part II is by no means a bad film. Its just a pale copy of the original. Having said that none of it is going to matter a whit to the legion of diehard Hangover fans who have been waiting two years to be taken on another night-long tear with Stu Alan and Phil.

Starring Jack Black and Gary Oldman. Directed by Jennifer Yuh. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is a ghastly sequel to a charming animated film though it may take a few minutes for the bad news to sink in. Everything about the new movie is on a bigger scale - its in 3-D too - and up through the opening credits there is a hope that bigger might be better. But its not not this time. The first installment was unsentimental. This one wallows in false sentiment. In the original it was a cute thing that Po the Panda (Jack Black) is the adopted son of a goose. In this iteration Po is forlorn because he wants to find out about his birth parents. Ah but finding out about pandas turns out to be difficult we discover in that most of them - youll love this - were slaughtered by an evil prince (a peacock voiced by Gary Oldman). Thats right we get a little adoption anxiety and genocide in the movies first minutes. So of course Po has to go to war with the evil peacock and that folks is the rest of the movie. From then on its all battle scenes taking up at a modest estimate about 80 percent of screen time. Po has his posse the same crew from the last movie including Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and they go up against the evil peacocks army. Lots of kung fu fighting and explosions. Related Stories Kung Fu Panda 2 This is a just plain bad story peculiar and discordant to the extent its there at all but also so flimsy and uninspired as almost to incite contempt not just disapproval. But I know what youre thinking OK so the story is a bust but if the movie is funny and the visuals are good who cares? Alas this time there are about three or four mild laughs in the whole picture and the entire visual aspect of the movie is a botched disappointment. The choreography of the battle scenes is without wit. Its all boom crash and thud. And aside from a pre-credits sequence involving the peacocks and a later memory scene that is bathed in red theres nothing to see. Plus the movie seems to have been crafted with little understanding of the opportunities and limitations of 3-D. Its all quick cuts and a jumbled succession of images as though it were in two dimensions. There is not a single moment in which the three dimensions are taken into special account and used in an imaginative way. ""Kung Fu Panda"" was fun and beautiful to look at and ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is neither. However it is the kind of movie in which the villain gets to say ""The only reason youre still alive is because I find your stupidity mildly amusing."" Villains are easily amused. -- Advisory Nonstop battle scenes aimed at a childrens audience. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Peter Travers reviews The Hangover Part II in his weekly video series ""At the Movies With Peter Travers"" The first Hangover caught me off-guard. Instead of an avalanche of bachelor-party re-tweets director and co-writer Todd Phillips raised the bar by leaving out the damn party and focusing on the hardcore hilarity of the before and after. And he found just the right actors to knock heads and psyches as a wussy wolf pack reeling from a Vegas bender the guys cant even remember. From the moment Bradley Cooper as married teacher Phil phoned the bride to say that he his wimpy dentist friend Stu (Ed Helms) and the brides nut-job brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis) had lost groom Doug (Justin Bartha) in Sin City the movie turned a moldy farce into a funhouse. The Hangover earned a worldwide gross of 467 million and the title as the most successful R-rated comedy in well forever. A sequel sounds like a no-brainer. Take the same ingredients add a new location - Bangkok replaces Vegas - and history repeats itself. Except it doesnt. The Hangover Part II isnt a total bummer. Phillips guides Galifianakis to a few mighty hoots but it is a disappointment which for me is harder to take than abject failure. Epic badness exerts a perverse fascination like Caddyshack II with no Bill Murray. But The Hangover follow-up just lies there waiting vainly to ignite even with the home-team champs mostly in place. The 12 Must-See Summer Movies -- Plus Five Unheralded Gems and Five More to Skip Cooper outstanding in Limitless isnt asked to do more than look pretty. Helms so solid in Cedar Rapids is pushed hard. Too hard. His Stu is now the groom on deck which is what brings the boys to Thailand. The parents of the bride Lauren (Jamie Chung) want the wedding on their home turf. Her father Fohn (Nirut Sirichanya) thinks Stu is a pussy and points with pride to his 16-year-old prodigy son Teddy (Mason Lee) a cello master doing pre-med at Stanford. The laws of sequeldom demand that the kid join the wolf pack at Stus bachelor party. On their one night in badass Bangkok Teddy ends up MIA. ""Bangkok has him"" whispers Mr. Chow. As the guys go in search of Teddy all R-rated hell breaks loose in the form of an angry crime boss (Paul Giamatti) an angrier Russian mob a bleeding facial tattoo a tranny hooker a sliced-off finger and a monkey with a monkey on her back that being a nasty smoking habit. Blame as per usual can be traced to Alan who has spiked some marshmallows with muscle relaxers and his ADD medication. Result? Drug-induced chaos in which the guys wake up the morning after oblivious to what happened the night before when they danced with the devil. This somehow leads to Alan shaving his head and Galifianakis walking off with every scene worth stealing. In the new Hollywood Galifianakis is the go-to guy for killer laughs. Even with Part II spinning out of control he gives the movie a center; hes roaringly funny but also surprisingly touching at making us believe in Alans need to belong. The rest is manic energy without a real destination. By crowding the film with incident - chases involving cars boats and bikes - Phillips crowds out the character details that made the first film a party to remember. The Complete Archive Over 20 Years of Peter Travers Movie Reviews Now Online Whos to blame for the fuck-up? This time Phillips co-wrote the script with different scribes whose credits dont inspire confidence Scot Armstrong worked on the Farrelly brothers flop The Heartbreak Kid and Craig Mazin lists Scary Movie 3 and 4 on his credit (debit?) sheet. Then again Phillips collaborated bracingly on the first Hangover with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who perpetrated the crimes of Four Christmases and Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. The problem is that The Hangover Part II isnt a movie at all its just a blueprint for one. To those who say expediency and a rush to a big payday had nothing to do with getting this sizzle-free sequel into the summer marketplace Im calling bullshit.

"The Hangover Part II review New take on same raunchy situation leaves nothing but a headache |       NJ.com comments The Hangover Part II review New take on same raunchy situation leaves nothing but a headache Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 26 2011 at 805 AM View/Post Comments Melinda Sue Gordon/Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures/MCT)Bradley Cooper from left Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms reprise their original roles -- and follow the same story line -- in ""The Hangover Part II."" When you keep going back for something even though youre past your limit and that small smart voice in your head is saying ""Enough"" youre likely to end up with a hangover. Or youre a filmmaker with ""The Hangover Part II"" -- another in whats threatening to be a long line of summer sequels remakes and re-dos that add nothing new. The first film was an out-of-nowhere surprise that made raunchy comedy out of alcoholic blackouts prostitutes drugs senseless violence tiny male genitalia and Mike Tyson. It was defiantly incorrect. It was also pretty funny and became historys highest-grossing R-rated comedy. Which almost guaranteed the creation of this second film -- which makes raunchy comedy out of alcoholic blackouts prostitutes drugs senseless violence tiny male genitalia and a Mike Tyson tattoo. Except it feels a little bit like that fourth dirty martini -- not a good idea at the time and probably to be regretted later. Movie Review The Hangover Part II (R) Warner Bros (101 min.) Directed by Todd Phillips. With Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Zach Galifianakis. Now playing in New Jersey. Rating note The film contains graphic nudity sexual situations drug and alcohol abuse strong language and violence. Stephen Whittys Review TWO STARS The new movie reunites the ""wolf pack"" of the first film -- party animal Bradley Cooper awkward nerd Ed Helms and madman Zach Galifianakis -- and drops them in Thailand where Helms is getting married. But as Helms confesses ""Im still putting the broken pieces of my psyche together"" after Las Vegas. So he insists no drugs no booze no hookers no repeat of their last bachelor party. Except what follows is a complete repeat of Las Vegas -- and unfortunately the first film. Theres a slightly nastier edge and an escalation (the first film had a missing tooth this one a missing finger) but its basically the same movie -- three manic guys dripping flop sweat trying to find a missing person (and trying to remember just what in hell they did the night before). The leads are all fine although theyve been doing these characters in one film or another for years -- Cooper as the sly operator Helms as the decent square Galifianakis as John Belushis bearded evil twin. They all know what theyre doing sure but by now so do we. And while the Thai scenery is pretty the movie depicts the entire country as either a luxury resort or a steaming slum. (Then again the same all-or-nothing attitude applies to the female characters who are either accommodating prostitutes or extremely forgiving wives.) Its all been-there drunk-that. Apart from a few fresh jokes (the best and broadest saved for the final credit sequence) the film remains content to just repeat the old situations rather than using them as a springboard for anything new hoping to coast by on good will and vague memories. ""I cant believe this is happening again"" several characters tiresomely repeatedly complain. Me neither. But if you want to see it happening again save yourself the price of a new ticket and go rent the original. And if you want to see a good new dirty-joke comedy go see ""Bridesmaids"" -- before the sequel monsters get their hands on that one too.

"The Hangover Part II Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review The Hangover Part IIThe sequel seems more interested in box-office loot than laughs.May 26 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Bradley Cooper left Zach Galifianakis and Ed Helms star in ""The... (Warner Bros. Pictures )Oh what a headache-inducing unapologetic money grab we have in ""The Hangover Part II."" By the time Bradley Coopers Phil says ""You know the drill"" and the guys start emptying their pockets in search of clues to the latest debacle youll be more inclined to groan than giggle. But then this sequel is about the ching ching not the comic arts. Me Im left with morning-after regrets. Lost is the fresh perverse painfully politically incorrect R-rated pleasure that came when ""The Hangover"" ate up the summer of 2009. Even the filmmakers signal a rehash is in the offing with the action kicked off by yet another fateful phone call bearing the a ""Oops we did it again"" a bad news. The same wrecking crew is in place with the core culprits a Phil (Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) a on tap for another drug-and-alcohol-induced blackout with a new missing person an old nemesis resurfacing and another wedding in jeopardy. Justin Barthas Doug who was the misplaced groom the last time out shows up briefly then remains poolside while his buddies go wild and crazy in Bangkok. Todd Phillips who directed the first and has a playbook stuffed with other whacked-out comedies ""Old School"" and ""Due Date"" among them is another returning player. He keeps the chaos churning squeezing the funny out of what he can and delivering some horribly hilarious moments that you may feel a need to apologize for laughing at later. Phillips collaborated with Craig Mazin (""Scary Movie 3 amp; 4"" and more) and Scot Armstrong (""Old School"" and others) to write the latest round of overindulgence. But this screenplay is far less inventive than the original written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore though the two plots are so intertwined that if you didnt see the first you wont get half of the jokes in the sequel. Heres the current setup. Its two years later and the tooth that naughty/nice/nerdy dentist Stu pulled in Vegas is fixed his wedding-chapel marriage to the stripper has been annulled and his nasty L.A. girlfriend ditched. He is about to marry his new squeeze a sweetheart named Lauren (Jamie Chung). The setting is Thailand inconvenient for everyone but hey its her ancestral home and its what the parents want. Given the history a bachelor party has been nixed in favor of a pancake brunch. But peer pressure has pushed Stu to invite prime hangover instigator Alan (Galifianakis) whose bedroom is a shrine to the crimes and misdemeanors of Vegas. Soon theyre all checking into a posh Thai beach resort determined to make this wedding as uneventful as possible. But then things happen as they do anytime Alan is involved with the wolf pack waking up in a seedy Bangkok hotel with a monkey a severed body part in the ice bucket Stu defaced yet again and Mr. Chow back in their business (Ken Jeong still naked and screaming). It gets worse; apparently sometime during the night the brides younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee) went missing. Theyve got to find Teddy fix a bunch of stuff and make it back for the wedding. Though Helms is still in charge of slapstick Galifianakis is the critical comic glue a he wears funny like an old T-shirt making it equally comfortable and uncomfortable to watch him depending on the needs of the scene. Cooper is considered the alpha dog I guess because hes always at the head of the pack as they unravel the havoc thats been wreaked. But actually his characters central purpose seems to be calling in disaster play-by-plays to the wedding party which he usually does with his shirt unbuttoned so maybe hes meant to be eye candy too. One of the more brilliant strokes in keeping the laugh factor high in ""The Hangover"" was its mix of crazy strangers the guys encounter in trying to reconstruct what happened (cops kids and Tasers anyone?). The filmmakers have gone back to that well too though not nearly as successfully. Mike Tyson returns but his cameo just doesnt have the same punch (so to speak). Theres a kinky monkey (Crystal) who has his/her moments but nothing as satisfying as the baby or the tiger or the chicken that vexed in Vegas. There is a nice bit of barely there with Paul Giamatti popping up as a heavy. The girls per usual are non-essential frills. The good news is that with three of the four guys married off and Alan not really knot-tying material there is no need for more hangovers. Unless of course the accountants have a vote. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESZach Galifianakis thrills fans at Hangover Part III...May 21 2013The Hangover Part III trailer The boys return to Sin CityMarch 7 2013Zach Galifianakis reportedly engaged.

More about The Hangover 2 >> Rather than just a hair The Hangover Part II chugs the whole furry pooch. All the better I suppose to regurgitate every plot turn of the original. Only the setting and the groom have been changed to differentiate this lifeless sequel from the lively 2009 hit. The setting Thailand; the groom Stu (Ed Helms). The arc is identical Stu Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) rise from a blackout drunk - not in a Las Vegas suite but a Bangkok flophouse where they begin to piece together what happened the night before. They wake to find an unusual animal has joined their menagerie. Instead of a growling tiger in the loo this time theres a mocking Capuchin monkey with a nasty cigarette habit and a stash of contraband drugs. Oh and once again Stus face is somewhat altered Instead of a missing tooth he has a new tattoo. Whats different is that this is a Three Stooges movie with a passport. The gangs in Thailand because its the native country of the lovely bride Lauren (Jamie Chung) whose dismissive dad (Nirut Sirichanya) finds Stu too underachieving for his successful family. Consider that Laurens kid brother Teddy (Mason Lee) 16 is a cello prodigy in the premed program at Stanford. Teddy joins Stus bachelor party on the beachfront of a resort hotel and the morning after the only trace of the 16-year-old is a severed finger encircled by his school ring. (His brother-in-law-to-be finds it in an ice-filled highball glass in that Bangkok no-tell hotel.) Can Stu mild-mannered romantic; Phil tough-talking cynic; and Alan borderline-personality man-child find the rest of Teddy and make it to the wedding on time? From Road Trip to The Hangover to Due Date director Todd Phillips has served as a cartographer of male passages (and rites of passage). For him Stu Phil and Alan represent the three flavors of guy Stu is vanilla and sweet with a streak of recklessness; Phil is bitter chocolate with a kick; Alan is a double dip of tutti-frutti. While these characters were amusing the first time around Phillips and his screenwriters dont bring much new to the party. The first Hangover succeeded precisely because the characters were unfamiliar and unexpected. In the sequel familiarity is comforting but it is also the enemy of surprise. Because in Phillips Bangkok-and-bull story almost everybody in Thailand is either a Buddhist monk or a sex worker; the movie gives off the stale odor of cultural stereotyping. Did I laugh? A handful of times. Did I cringe? For 101 minutes. When Ken Jeong who reprises his role as the irritating gangster Mr. Chow appears and flashes his privates it reminds us that one consonant separates ""public"" from ""pubic.""

By Melinda Sue Gordon Warner Bros.

EnlargeClose By Melinda Sue Gordon Warner Bros. Pictures One night in Bangkok Zack Galifianakis left Bradley Cooper Justin Bartha and Ed Helms stumble into more outrageous high jinks in the sequel to 2009s comedy smash. Its not that the jokes in this ill-fated sequel are rehashed from the first film. Refried humor would have felt like a cold beer in the summer sun here. Instead the sequel dispenses a (five oclock) shadow of the original a comedy that uses the same punchlines sometimes literally as the first film but mistakes further-fetched skits for funnier ones. Whereas The Hangover delighted in politically incorrect comedy that included babies getting bonked in the head and men misplacing teeth here we get cocaine overdoses and severed fingers. VIDEOPreview The Hangover Part II STORYThe Hangover Part II premiere PHOTOHollywood swinging with Crystal the monkey Was director Todd Phillips still groggy when he co-wrote this tale of another bachelor party gone awry this time in Bangkok? He has gone from Road Trip Old School and Hangover to most recently Due Date and this misfire. His humor like his films has taken an inexplicable turn for the mean-spirited. Witness Phil (Bradley Cooper) the hunky party animal whose escapades in Vegas in the original did nothing to satiate his love of a bender. He was a charming souse in the first a guy whose grin-and-swill-it attitude helped make the 2009 original the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever. That charm must have evaporated in the heat of a dilapidated Thailand hotel where Phil and buddies Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) awake in another stupor far from the site of Stus impending wedding. Consider the first film and the comedic discovery as our heroes trundled through their Vegas hotel room to find a baby a chicken and Mike Tysons hungry tiger. The Hangover Part II   out of four Stars Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis Ed Helms Director Todd Phillips Distributor TriStar Pictures Rating R for pervasive language strong sexual content including graphic nudity drug use and brief violent images. Running time 1 hour 42 minutes Opens Wednesday nationwide The trio unearth new party casualties this time including a lifeless body and the severed finger of a teenager. Their response is to dump the body in the hotel ice machine. Then bolt it. Get it? If not youre in for a long movie. Hangover II marks one of the most derivative sequels of the year The opening and closing scenes are taken almost shot-for-shot from the original. Just substitute Asians for Americans gross-outs for guffaws. Some members of the cast still shine. Galifianakis can deliver a deadpan joke as effectively (and just as absurdly) as Will Ferrell. Ken Jeong who reprises his role as fast-talking Mr. Chow has some laugh-out-loud moments though his rapper-wannabe schtick is getting old. Tyson makes a clever return and theres a chain-smoking dope-dealing monkey who is going to get some laughs. But it still feels watered down. For all the talent Hangover II reassembles our boys just cant muster the hair of the dog that bit them the first time around. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

You almost cant win. Fans of the first film want to see their favorite elements revisited but they get mad if its TOO similar because then youre just being lazy. But if you veer too far from the path established by the first movie the fans are disappointed about that too. To summarize then a comedy sequel needs to do exactly what the first movie did but differently but not too differently and not too much the same. I didnt laugh as much as The Hangover Part II as I did at The Hangover -- maybe because the simple-yet-brilliant scenario is no longer fresh and maybe because theres a stretch of oh I dont know 30 minutes where nothing particularly funny happens. The guys who wrote the first movie arent credited on this one but they should have been because I get the feeling the sequel was written the same way ""Saturday Night Live"" redoes sketches they copied and pasted the original script to preserve the structure then just replaced the details. So instead of Las Vegas the guys are in Bangkok. Instead of waking up with a missing tooth Stu has a tattoo. (It cant be someone else. It has to be Stu. Because it happened to Stu the first time you see.) Instead of a baby theres a monkey. Instead of having misplaced the groom theyve lost the brides teenage brother. Instead of criminals and strippers there are different criminals and different strippers (VERY different strippers). The groom this time is Stu (Ed Helms) himself. Hes marrying a Thai girl named Lauren (Jamie Chung) with the ceremony to be held in her homeland. Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Doug (Justin Bartha) fly out for the occasion (as do their respective wives but mostly just so they can answer the phone and say ""Really? It happened again?""). Dougs brother-in-law you will no doubt recall is Alan the bizarre and possibly mentally handicapped man played by Zach Galifianakis. He is sad not to have been invited to Thailand for the wedding. And heck it wouldnt be much of a Hangover sequel without Alan so the guys relent and invite him after all. Now the only question is How will they get Ken Jeongs Mr. Chow involved?? Everyone tries very hard not to have a repeat of what happened last time someone was getting married but one thing leads to another and next thing you know youre in a seedy Bangkok hotel room and Laurens brother Teddy (Mason Lee) is missing. The guys utter a lot of variations of ""It happened again"" and ""I cant believe this is happening again"" I guess we should award the film a few points for acknowledging how odd it is that the same misfortunes keep befalling the same people. A lot of sequels gloss over that and hope we wont notice. Some points for nerve should also be awarded to director Todd Phillips who co-wrote the screenplay with Craig Mazin (Superhero Movie) and frequent collaborator Scot Armstrong (Road Trip Old School). The degree to which the film duplicates the original story is astonishing -- not just the basic scenario of not being able to remember a wild night but specific plot points and in the same order. Basically if you want to avoid spoilers for The Hangover Part II dont watch The Hangover. As with the first movie the sequel eventually descends into a period of frantic outrageousness in which the mechanics of the plot must be carried out whether theyre funny or not and they often are not. As a character Phil barely registers (Cooper still gets top billing though) while Stu continues to be likable if a bit prone to hysterics. Most of the laughs are thanks to Alan including several non sequiturs that I would bet came from Galifianakis and not the script. Hes a lively unforgettable character -- but even he cant compete with the version of him we saw two years ago the one who was new and had not already been rehashed (essentially) in Due Date. The Hangover if not exactly revolutionary was a perfectly good raunch-com that showcased the different skills of its actors. Its sequel is more of the same only less so. Why pay to see it when you could just re-watch the first one?

Pictures I Think It Happened Again I Think It Happened Again Credit Warner Bros. Pictures ""If it aint broke dont fix it."" Thats the approach director Todd Phillips takes in the follow-up to his hit morning-after comedy The Hangover moving the story halfway around the world to Thailand but otherwise employing the same formula that earned the first film nearly a half-billion dollars. A surprisingly exact replica of that formula in fact -- making The Hangover Part II feel less like a sequel and more like a remake. The result is a cinematic illustration of the law of diminishing returns in which more money more exotic locales more crazy situations and more Mike Tyson all fuel a familiar carnival of abasement. And as at any carnival the rides just arent as much fun on the second go-round. Once again theres a wedding this time for Stu (Ed Helms) who is marrying a Thai-American woman whose wealthy parents insist that the festivities take place at a picturesque island resort in her homeland. Once again despite Stus best efforts to ensure disaster wont strike -- he stages his ""bachelor party"" at a sedate IHOP brunch before the guys even depart for Thailand -- a pharmaceutical-induced haze causes Stu his crass buddy Phil (Bradley Cooper) and the socially inept man-child Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to wake up two days before the wedding with no idea what happened the night before. And once again a member of the previous evenings party is missing. Not Doug (Justin Bartha) the missing groom of The Hangover wholl turn out to have gone back to his hotel room and missed the nights debauchery entirely. This time its Teddy (Mason Lee) the teen-prodigy brother of Stus bride-to-be. All thats left of him in the seedy Bangkok hotel room where the guys find themselves is his finger still encircled by his Stanford class ring. Its not that Part II is bad exactly. If The Hangover had never existed this movie might feel funnier than it does if not quite as freshly hilarious. Theyre both detective stories at their core -- with the three men following the clues in an attempt to piece together a lost night and find a friend with the ticking time bomb of the approaching nuptials hanging always over their heads -- and its the surprises of their investigative discoveries that fuel the comedy. i The plot might not seem as inventively inspired the second time around but the trio of Cooper Galifianakis and Helms still has the winning chemistry that made the first Hangover film so funny. Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros. Pictures hide caption toggle caption Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros. Pictures The plot might not seem as inventively inspired the second time around but the trio of Cooper Galifianakis and Helms still has the winning chemistry that made the first Hangover film so funny. Melinda Sue Gordon/Warner Bros. Pictures But without varying the structure Phillips paints himself into a corner. If surprise and incongruity are the cornerstones of comedy knowing in advance the essence of whats coming next undercuts the humor. Without many structural surprises to exploit Phillips is forced to make the details more outlandish. Instead of having a tooth knocked out Stu wakes up with a facial tattoo; instead of merely being socially awkward Alan seems abusive and almost dangerously deranged; instead of finding a tiger in their bathroom they end up keeping company with a cigarette-smoking drug-mule monkey with a penchant for biting genitalia. And instead of accidentally marrying a hooker with a heart of gold Stu manages to ... well the outcome of that particular upped ante is perhaps best left undescribed. The situations still have some laughs left in them and Helms Cooper and Galifianakis (with a solid assist from Ken Jeong reprising and building on his role as the oddball gangster Chow) still share the comic rapport that made the original such fun. But the jokes feel strained where once they felt easy over-reaching to compensate for the structural laziness of a film that has no identity of its own. There might not have been anything broken for Phillips to fix but even the sharpest blade gets dull with overuse -- and without the whetstone of innovation The Hangover Part II just doesnt cut it.

"Hangover Part II The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; hangover-part-ii-the ) Hangover Part II The (United States 2011) May 25 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli When Yogi Berra said ""Its dA(c)jA  vu all over again"" maybe he said it best. Then again perhaps it was John McClane ""How can the same shit happen to the same guy twice?"" While neither was specifically referring to The Hangover Part II Todd Phillips sequel to the unexpected 2009 blockbuster they might have been. Using the original as a template The Hangover Part II colors within the lines but does so with bright fluorescents rather than drab primaries. Despite being mandated by the insane box office success of its predecessor this movie feels anything but obligatory. It delivers what its expected to deliver and thats likely to make it a success with anyone who laughed his ass off two summers ago. This Hangover begins two years after the last one and features many of the same characters including Iron Mike. Returning once again for another masochistic go-round are the four members of the ""Wolf Pack"" Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug (Justin Bartha). The occasion of their reunion is Stus wedding to the lovely Lauren (Jamie Chung) an event occurring in her native Thailand. Stu wisely opts to skip the bachelor party recalling the infamous night-before Dougs nuptials but unwisely decides to join his comrades sitting around a bonfire on a Thai beach swapping stories drinking beer and roasting marshmallows. Next thing any of them knows theyre waking up in a seedy Bangkok dive. Its Phil Stu (with a new facial adornment) and Alan (with a new hairdo). Not with them are Doug and Laurens teenage brother Teddy (Mason Lee) although the young Stanford pre-med student was on the beach with them and has left behind his finger. Now its up to the trio to decode what happened last night find Teddy and get back to Thailand before the wedding. If only things were that easy... Rightly assuming that The Hangover Part II should not deviate from the formula that worked in The Hangover Phillips and his crew almost remake the first movie albeit with different setups and payoffs. The change in setting (from Vegas to Bangkok) spices things up and while the storyline is familiar its not stale. Its not quite as fun solving the ""mystery"" of the missing night here as it was in The Hangover but this isnt Agatha Christie. The humor is as dark raunchy and envelope-pushing as in the original with plenty of laughs to be had by all who appreciate their comedy closer to NC-17 than PG. Had an indie studio released The Hangover Part II it would likely have been accorded an NC-17 by the prudish MPAA. Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis slide into their roles as if they didnt go on to play other characters in the interim although at least two of the three (Helms being the exception) have seen significant career upticks. Phil is the good-looking leader Stu is the worry-wart nerd and Alan is quite possibly the most loathsome individual to have crawled out from under a rock. Hes not a loveable loser; hes a detestable loser - and thats where a lot of the comedy comes from. Galifianakis stole the show in The Hangover and he steals it here. Refreshingly Phillips does not feel the need to give Alan a heroic moment of redemption. Other returning players are Justin Bartha whose screen time is curtailed when Doug is allowed to stay in Thailand for this misadventure; Ken Jeong whose Mr. Chow is no less coarse; and the wives (Sasha Barrese and Gillian Vigman). Improbably theres also Mike Tyson who enters the scene crooning the words to ""One Night in Bangkok"" and later growls at Stu to remove his tattoo. Newcomers to The Hangover Part II include Paul Giamatti (looking eerily like his father Bart) Mason Lee and Nick Cassavetes in a role originally intended for Mel Gibson. In addition to retaining the structure of The Hangover with the protagonists following half-baked clues to figure out their activities and whereabouts of the previous night The Hangover Part II stays true in other areas as well. Most of the nudity is male which is reasonable since naked men are generally funnier than naked women. The end credits roll alongside a slideshow of still photographs from the ""missing night"" and many of the biggest laughs are to be found here. Often comedy sequels that follow the formulas of their predecessors fail miserably. The list is long and inglorious with titles like Airplane 2 and Three Men and a Little Lady near the top. Perhaps because of its brash and unapologetic nature The Hangover Part II doesnt fall prey to that pitfall. Although not as shockingly unexpected as the first movie this one is still a garish orgy of bad taste and dare-you-not-to-laugh comedy. The ""oods"" of humor all apply rude crude and lewd. As Alan remarks ""When a monkey nibbles on a penis its funny in any language."" It will be interesting to see where the filmmakers go with The Hangover Part III because its hard to imagine this film not scoring big at the box office.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + I cant believe this is happening again screams one of the heroes of ""The Hangover Part II at an uncaring Bangkok sky. Thats the functional paradox driving every movie sequel that characters and audience alike have to suspend disbelief while the same things happen all over again. The only acceptable change is in the direction of more If not better a Part II always has to be bigger.In the case of ""The Hangover Part II that means raunchier nastier darker. It also means much more predictable which is ruinous. Since the original ""Hangover was predicated on surprise -- how could the reality of the night before ever match up to the wreckage of this morning after? -- hitting the same beats in more or less the same order removes the shock laughs and leaves only the scuzziness. The movies an unclean thing and a mostly unfunny one.Contorting itself to get all the players back into their starting boxes ""Hangover Part II sends the ""wolf pack to sunny Thailand for the wedding of Stu (Ed Helms) to Lauren (Jamie Chung). Still a gawky nice-guy dentist he has shed both the castrating fiancee and sweetie-pie hooker wife from the first movie has apparently grown back his tooth and is marrying into an Asian-American family with a glowering paterfamilias (Nirut Sirichanya). The one thing Stu doesnt want is a bachelor party.He gets one of course. I dont have to explain how he wakes up in a sleazy Bangkok hotel room with no memories of the night before -- if you saw the first film you have a pretty good idea -- but the Maori tattoo on his face is a nice hint of how low a man with no inhibitions can go. Along for the ride is cynical best friend Phil (Bradley Cooper) again leading the investigation into what the hell happened and freaky-deaky man-child Alan (Zach Galifianakis).There was a fourth the brides kid brother Teddy (Mason Lee son of director Ang Lee) but he has gone missing leaving behind only a severed finger with a Stanford ring. (The first movies groom played by Justin Bartha still doesnt get to play along since hes back at home base stalling the wedding party.) ""Hangover Part II precisely replicates the search for the missing friend with stops at bars and strip clubs run-ins with angry Russian gangsters and angrier Buddhist monks and a running gag involving a pet monkey who wears a Rolling Stones jacket and enjoys cigarettes and fellatio. ""When a monkey nibbles on a penis its funny in any language says Alan which probably explains why these movies are worldwide hits.Because were in the wild wild East this time rather than Vegas the potential for genuinely taboo (i.e. non-American) behavior is there at least in the Western popular imagination and the minds of the filmmakers. ""The Hangover Part II is oddly shy about this until its not at which point it pushes against the edges of its R rating with a vengeance. A modest note to parents Since the first ""Hangover was also a runaway hit on home video millions of middle-schoolers across the country may spend the weekend trying to sneak into this sequel. Which is great really since youre just not ready for high school until youve had a good look at a Thai transsexuals scrotum.Director Todd Phillips returns with a new writing team and clearly everyone has been given orders not to mess with a sure thing. So Ken Jeong is back as the fey foul-mouthed gangster Mr. Chow and once again he jumps naked out of hiding in one scene. Putting this mincing yellowface caricature in an actual East Asian setting might seem like playing with fire but in general ""Part II is less racist than utterly clueless.One of the few new faces is Paul Giamatti looking puffy and out-of-sorts as a growling American Mr. Big. Otherwise the movie is crasser than ever yet safer than before. A sort of Gene Wilder on horse tranquilizers Galifianakis was the rogue element that put ""The Hangover over the top and hes the only I repeat only saving grace of the sequel. Almost every one of Alans lines every bit of physical schtick gets a laugh -- if only a nervous one -- but the momentum never builds to combustible levels; and too many of the gags like a flashback in which the main characters are played as adults by children are more weird than funny.Meanwhile the ick factor is rising fast. By the final scenes of the new film the boys are desperately in need of a long hot shower. So dear Lord are we.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2011 Globe Newspaper Company.

(Warner Bros.) Elizabeth Weitzman Wednesday May 25 2011 154 PM Title The Hangover Part II Buddies reunite for a catastrophic bachelor party. With Ed Helms Bradley Cooper. Director Todd Phillips (142). R graphic language violence nudity sexuality. At area theaters. Delivering just what its no-frills title promises ""The Hangover Part II"" is an unashamed attempt to recapture the magic of the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever. Whether under orders from nervous studio execs or wary of taking his own risks director Todd Phillips sticks so close to the formula of his original that even the characters are given to saying things like ""I cant believe this is happening again."" Of course they also say things like ""When a monkey nibbles on a penis its funny in any language."" Actually not so much. But you know exactly what youre getting and you get exactly what you came for another outrageously wild ride with the ""wolf pack."" Finally recovered from his ""Hangover"" adventures Ed Helms sad-sack Stu is about to marry Lauren (Jamie Chung) in Thailand. Though he firmly refuses a bachelor party his buddies Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) have other plans. Right before the wedding they all wake up in a filthy Bangkok motel with no memory of the night before. But Stus brother-in-law (Mason Lee) is missing the drug-dealing Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) is dead and a gangster (Paul Giamatti) is on their trail. As Phil himself sighs ""You know the drill."" Though the women are still sidelined this script--written by Phillips with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong--is a little kinder to them. The men however are unspared in a seedy setting that takes us from underage tattoo parlors to back-alley brothels each friend acknowledges surprisingly dark demons. Fortunately the actors have developed a genuine chemistry which allows us to enjoy even the most outlandish events. Like any fever dream this one falls apart as soon as you try to analyze it. Its the atmosphere that remains the liberating sense of adventure that bonds the boys with each other and the audience. Even so it would be nice if Phillips could find something original to say when we all get together to tear the next town apart.

""The Hangover Part II"" only has to show up to succeed. At once pushy and lazy the sequel follows the 2009 smash which has become the most lucrative R-rated comedy in history. Isnt that depressing? I find that depressing.""Hangover II"" substitutes Bangkok for Las Vegas and otherwise follows the templates laid out by director Todd Phillips in the original with a ruthless lack of creativity. I laughed maybe twice though as with the first one (which I didnt like either -- clearly I have ""Hangover"" issues) Ed Helms put-upon dentist Stu here getting married to a Thai-American woman (Jamie Chung) in her familys native land is the sole source of good will compensating for the scripts permeating smugness.Why cant I get on board with these movies which strive simply for a rollicking disreputable good time? Too many women enjoyed the first one to write off the phenomenon as a guy thing. Id say its more of a comedy thing.Phillips -- whose previous picture ""Due Date"" helped to further the mysterious bankability of Zach Galifianakis -- favors a rough edge a mean streak and a vaguely putrid visual style in his tales of badly behaving men. Pushing comic scenarios into offensive and risky territory (a la ""Borat"" co-written by Phillips which I love) can pay significant dividends in the right hands. The envelope-pushing stuff in ""Hangover II"" however made me want to push back.Again a night of extreme debauchery leaves the lads clueless and foggy-brained unable to recall anything without photographic evidence saved for the end credits. Bradley Cooper returns as Phil the ""cool"" one who rarely takes off his sunglasses and while Cooper has talent I find his character in these ""Hangovers"" to be a jerk. Nothing more. The vaguely pederastic screwball played by Galifianakis same thing.Once again we have the ""wake-up scene"" which reveals the boys/men in a hotel room somewhere in Bangkok. Once again we have a missing person Its Helms future brother-in-law (Mason Lee) whom the lads must locate in time for the wedding. Once again the cackling Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong whose privates come once again in for sight gaggery) and his underworld comrades provide a bit of plot for those who need a bit of plot.Whatever. I need jokes. Something more than a situation recycling the situation in the first one. Id like filmmakers who worldwide grosses aside show more of an interest in filming visual comedy -- gross-out violent action-based whatever -- with some finesse. The other day someone said to me ""Well you know Knocked Up 40-Year-Old Virgin Hangover its all the same."" No it isnt No it isnt. The best of Judd Apatows guy-centric comedies take care of business (i.e. theyre witty) in addition to taking care of business. ""Hangover II"" is more like a spitball meeting a series of ideas that might in theory be good enough for a sequel than it is an actual movie.mjphillipstribune.comMPAA rating R (for pervasive language strong sexual content including graphic nudity drug use and brief violent images)Cast Bradley Cooper (Phil); Ed Helms (Stu); Zach Galifianakis (Alan); Justin Bartha (Doug); Ken Jeong (Mr. Chow); Paul Giamatti (Kingsley)Credits Directed by Todd Phillips; written by Phillips Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong; produced by Phillips and Dan Goldberg.

Comments (2) click to enlarge The Hangover Part II Video Rated R  102 minutes  2011 Ed Helms Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis return as bachelor-party boys prone to disaster but director Todd Phillips understands that the real star of The Hangover was its cagey story structure which he carefully copies for this sequel. This time geeky dentist Stu (Helms) is engaged to marry an elegant young Thai woman in her native land and the desperate opening phone call from worldly Phil (Cooper) back to the wedding party comes not from Vegas but from Bangkok where he Stu and the demented Alan (Galifianakis) have woken from an epic drunk to find the brides teenage brother missing. Again the movie turns into a dense memory play as the heroes track down the brother and reassemble what happened the night before; and again the story loops back around to the opening phone call and then to the climax. Its still fun to watch but the first one was better. With Ken Jeong Mike Tyson and Paul Giamatti. By J.R.

Initially it went down a lot like 2009s The Hangover which is to say tasteless and comically potent. Three men again retrace their missteps from their blacked-out previous night looking for a missing member of a wedding party as the ceremony approaches. Set in Thailand the sequel is darker and tawdrier than the original and not quite as uproarious. Aiming for replication it cant help being mannered. Every dirty word arrives with a sense of calculated bravado; every gander at flapping male genitalia might as well be accompanied by trumpets. Most of the laughs go down easily. Most. Not the one where someone calls a Middle Easterner a camel jockey. And a bit that makes 1992s The Crying Game look restrained mainly illuminates how comfortable the filmmakers are with homophobia. Stu (Ed Helms) Phil (Bradley Cooper the handsomest lizard in America) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) handle a fresh corpse and a gunshot wound with more aplomb than they do the revelation that someone they knew had sex with a man. (Accidentally Kind of.) And when I looked in the mirror the next day I realized Id consumed too many shots of a pet monkey doing awful things. According to Alan ""When a monkey nibbles on a penis its funny in any language"" but actually its only funny the first time. Then it just feels perverted and cruel. (See TIMEs review of The Hangover.) The slender plot serves only to get the group to a place where sin is readily available. Having been liberated from a harridan in the first film some two years later dentist Stu finds a real soul mate (Jamie Chung) and plans to marry her in Thailand. Or as socially challenged probably-has-Aspergers syndrome Alan likes to call it Thighland. I kept forgetting what the fiancees name is (Lauren) but not what Phil says about her shes an angel and has a ""solid rack for an Asian."" The former is certainly true she forgives everything even that the guys put the life of her 16-year-old brother Teddy (played by Ang Lees cute son Mason) in danger. As for her ""solid rack"" I defer to Phils expertise. Such audacity is as important to The Hangover franchise as the bachelor-party theme. You are supposed to walk out thinking How do they get away with this? while not-so-secretly relishing that they do. Chatting about solid racks is commonplace in the average human wolf pack -- thats what Alan likes to call the crew -- and thats part of the franchises success. So is liberation from routine. Thailand with its thriving sex industry is even more suited than Las Vegas to loosening inhibitions (and boundaries theres a pedophilia joke). Bangkok stuns even guys who lived through a night with Mike Tyson and Mr. Chow in Vegas. ""Holler"" screeches Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong reprising the role). ""City of squalor."" (See ""Zach Galifianakis Hates to Be Loved."") As the stud of the group (although apparently happily married) Phil is the de facto leader of the pack. Cooper gives a knowing performance hes both the peacock and the parody of one. Hes blessed with good looks and fantastic timing the kind that makes every line funnier even the small asides. ""Eight stitches"" he muses as they leave a doctors office. ""It only cost 6. How is that possible?"" Though more of a straight man Helms has pitch-perfect timing too. Then theres Galifianakis the strange antagonistic creature the anti-movie star without whom none of this would be possible. The chemistry this trio has is special; the premise of the sequel seems worn but the way they work against and with one another is what provides the pleasure. Everyone else in the cast is essentially irrelevant with the exception of Jeong. His comic intonations -- a little effeminate heavily singsong completely politically incorrect -- are so purely funny no one will much care that it makes no sense for Mr. Chow to be in Thailand. Because it doesnt tamper with a hugely successful formula The Hangover Part II is bound to be a hit. Which means theres a good chance these guys will get wasted and screw up monumentally a third time. Theres one bachelor left in the crew after all Alan. Surely he wouldnt bring roofies to his own wedding. Could these actors gather for an occasion that doesnt involve losing consciousness and still be funny? Id like to think so but its far more likely that somewhere a screenwriter is already looking at a blank page saying to himself O.K. how can we top that monkey business?

Starring Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Zach Galifianakis Ken Jeong Director Todd Phillips Release Opened May 25 2011  Editorial Review The Hangover Part IIBy Ann HornadayWednesday May 25 2011Summer wouldnt be fittingly launched without a go-for-broke raunchy comedy the kind of uncensored emotionally expansive movie where pleasure can be found not just in the taboos it gleefully smashes but in its celebration of friendship emotional growth and sundry humanist values. Ladies and gentlemen we have that movie Its called ""Bridesmaids"" and its playing at your local multiplex.""The Hangover Part II"" qualifies as a valuable film as well albeit in what it teaches us about the perils of formula sequelitis and taking your audience for granted. A veritable textbook case of what not to do when re-making a comedy that depended on sheer surprise for most of its appeal ""The Hangover Part II"" also inadvertently points up the weaknesses of the first movie which became a huge hit two summers ago. Fans of ""The Hangover"" -- which starred Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis as refugees from a Las Vegas bachelor party gone horribly wrong -- were prone to forget the long laugh-free sequences in between the more memorable set pieces just as they easily overlook the fact that were it not for Galifianakiss quietly deranged presence ""The Hangover"" would likely have been a hamhanded unevenly paced dud.In ""Part II"" those two facts are revealed in inescapably stark relief as director Todd Phillips working from a script he wrote with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong follows the first movie beat-for-beat switching a character and location here and there but never straying far from the original template. So the movie opens with Coopers Phil -- scruffy sweaty red-eyed -- dolefully calling Tracy the impending bride from the first movie to tell her that once again ""We [screwed] up."" By ""we"" of course he means Alan (Galifianakis) and Stu (Ed Helms) who is about to be married in Thailand.Just how did Stu come to be engaged to a woman of Thai extraction when the original ""Hangover"" seemed to suggest a future of wedded bliss with Heather Grahams hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold? Not to worry all is explained in ""Part II"" where bits and bobs of exposition are helpfully tucked in during the guys pancake breakfast or in Alans bedroom a wall full of incriminating Vegas photos.Once the posse lands in Thailand ""just one beer"" two nights before the wedding turns into a similar bender with the three principals awaking in a Bangkok hotel room with a severed finger a monkey in a Rolling Stones vest and no memory of how they got there. And theyve managed to lose Stus future brother-in-law launching a search of the citys bars strip clubs and tattoo parlors where theyve left a trail of havoc in their wake.Other than a cigarette-smoking monkey instead of a sunglasses-wearing baby a lurid face tattoo instead of a missing tooth and a locale that exchanges Vegass ersatz sheen for a decidedly dingier dank aesthetic ""The Hangover Part II"" offers absolutely nothing new to fans of the first film. In fact once the comfort of familiarity has worn off they may well feel as baited-and-switched as the patrons of one of the sketchier clubs the boys visit. Granted ""Part II"" offers some predictably outrageous sight gags including male frontal nudity where you least expect it. But for the most part the filmmakers have followed the first recipe so slavishly and with such little genuine imagination that most of the entertainment value lies in matching up gags in the sequel with their funnier -- analogs in the original. The one cheering exception to an otherwise ho-hum exercise is Galifianakis who plays the spoiled sartorially challenged man-child Alan a preening glowering utterly fascinating conundrum composed of co-equal parts naivete hauteur feral menace and barely submerged homoerotic desire. Its Alan -- who describes himself as a ""stay-at-home-son"" with the gravitas of someone announcing hes the head of the SEC -- who has the films most surreally humorous dialogue. And its Galifianakis who gives those jokes extra mileage by way of the surreal afterthought. ""I wish monkeys could Skype"" is a funny line sure. But its the wistful yearning with which Galifianakis adds ""Maybe one day"" that sends it into the ether of comic genius.Still as absurdly funny as Alans sick asides can be (""Feet first Ive done this before"" he mutters as the boys try to stuff a dead body into an ice machine) theyre too few and far between to make ""The Hangover Part II"" worth the party. Like the first film the funniest sequence is the final photo montage of what really went down that night; unlike the first the squalor grunge and moral turpitude that precede it carry no shock value or cathartic release. Reportedly Phillips and his producers are already gearing up for ""The Hangover Part III"" but they might have already hit rock bottom. Maybe its time they swore off the stuff.Contains pervasive profanity; strong sexual content including graphic nudity; drug use; and brief violent images.

Phil (Bradley Cooper) from left Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Stu (Ed Helms) find themselves in Bangkok this time around. Photo WARNER BROS. The Hangover II 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Hangover Part IIuncorks smut so outlandish unapologetic free-flowing and graphic that you have to wonder really how this andThe Kings Speech both merit an R. You also have to wonder whether its time to consider a new rating maybe an R-plus-ultra to cover mainstream comedies that should cause parents to fling themselves bodily at kids in line for tickets. This is one of those movies. It features many many bad words and makes light of many many bad things drug overdoses unprotected sex with prostitutes severed fingers monkeys smoking cigarettes. And yet this dark and seedy follow-up to 2009s blockbuster comedy has quite a retro message -- suggesting that civilized men carry inside them a monster a ""demon"" within that requires constant taming. Why no less a theologian than Johnny Cash pleads on the soundtrack ""God help the beast in me."" If The HangoverPart I celebrated the wild thang in every domesticated American male Part II pushes him to the brink of a howling existential crisis. It keeps the old premise - guys wake with amnesia after a sick night of bachelor-partying - and sticks to the familiar mystery-comedy format doling out new revelations and riotous shockers every few minutes. It asks not whodunit (we know who done it dem fools who blacked out) but what the heck happened period. The screenwriters have changed (from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore to Scot Armstrong and Craig Mazin) but the director remains the same Todd Phillips. The guys remain the same starchy Stu (Ed Helms) jerky Phil (Bradley Cooper) and crazy infantile Alan (Zach Galifianakis) plus screechy Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and mild-mannered Doug (Justin Bartha) who went missing in the last movie and stays behind in this one. This time Stus the one getting married. He wakes with Mike Tysons face tattoo not a missing tooth. The chemically fueled partying occurs in Bangkok not Las Vegas. The tiny primate they acquire is a monkey not a baby. And the character gone missing - well all but his finger - is Teddy (Mason Lee son of director Ang) the brides innocent teenage brother. Oops. ""It happened again"" confesses Phil in the brief flash-forward that opens the movie. And yet despite all the similarities despite the same madcap plotting and hysterically unhinged comic filth The Hangover Part II veers into much darker territory. Bangkok for one thing out-depraves Vegas by a long shot; gone is the safe prefabricated sheen of Sin City replaced by sweat and smog that hides the missing Teddy. ""Bangkok has him now"" mutters a cagey tattoo artist played by filmmaker Nick Cassavetes. Other new additions include tough-talking Paul Giamatti and several Buddhist monks one of them a smiling old fellow who participates (indirectly) in one of the movies plentiful penis gags. When in doubt I guess just turn the camera on a male sex organ. Or something that looks like one. Or might be mistaken for one by a drug-dealing simian - because quoth Alan ""When a monkey nibbles on a penis its funny in any language."" amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Teva Sale Up to 40% off + free shipping PUMA Mens Tazon 6 Ripstop Sneakers for 40 + free shipping Dicks Sporting Goods Summer Sale Up to 50% off + free shipping Sierra Trading Post Spring amp; Summer Cleanout Up to 95% off Powered by Contests Enter to win concert tickets airfare and hotel More Entertainment News Rolling Stones Lash Out at Donald Trump (Again) Over Song Use Daveed Diggs Renee Elise Goldsberry to Leave Hamilton Broken Social Scene Working on New Album Steve Young of M/A/R/R/S Pump Up the Volume Fame Dead Calvin Harris Taylor Swift Song Co-Write Questions We Still...

Picture Star Tribune Bradley Cooper Ken Jeon Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis in ""The Hangover Part II"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Doubling down on the formula that made ""The Hangover"" the most successful R-rated comedy ever ""Hangover 2"" leaves no avenue unexplored in its relentless quest to assault sensibilities breach taboos and induce vomiting. The premise is pure deja vu. On the day after a bachelor party for Stu (Ed Helms) he awakes alongside Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) in a decimated hotel room. The men have pounding heads physical disfigurements of mysterious origin amnesia about what went on the night before and no clue where the fourth member of their party is. This time what happened in Vegas happens in Thailand and the AWOL friend -- Stus teenage brother-in-law-to-be -- isnt entirely gone. He left behind his college ring with his finger still in it. Repeating the structure of the first film beat for beat writer/director Todd Phillips keeps things fresh by going sleazier and more depraved a litany of pain and suffering played for laughs. Its one part comedy to four parts juvenile delinquency. The chums discover neon-lit shopping districts that the Bangkok Tourist Board refuses to publicize. Theyre terrorized by underworld types shot at by motorcycle goons saddled with a corpse mocked by the police beaten by a Buddhist monk loved up by a showgirl with unexpected attributes and serenaded by a former heavyweight champ who perpetrates some of the worst singing ever recorded. Their only friend is a chain-smoking capuchin monkey. As before the idiots race against time to piece together how their evening went so horribly wrong and how they might repair the damage. The three stooges get a pinch more time to flesh out their characters. Cooper and Helms have a nice bantering scene early on that hints why the playboy and the dorky dentist bonded as friends. We get a slice or two deeper into Alans mental layer cake of huffing hostility rich-kid entitlement and social ineptitude. As usual the womens roles are less than window dressing theyre scarcely curtain rods. THE HANGOVER PART II  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for pervasive language strong sexual content including graphic nudity drug use and brief violent images. Shooting on location gives the film an oppressive sense of immediacy. The cast is clearly drooping in the heat and the scummy backstreets exude an authentic feeling of danger. Cutaways to the bridal party at the spectacular seaside honeymoon resort offer us a breather from the big citys oppressive temperature and humidity. For my money the funniest passages in the first film came not from the ostensible stars but from Ken Jeongs fey obnoxious gangsta-talking crime lord Mr. Chow. He reprises the role here taking it to wilder reaches of insanity posing for a still photo in the end credits montage that is so appallingly tasteless in its re-creation of a historical outrage that its nearly genius. It is very sick and it gave me one of the biggest laughs Ive had in weeks. So mission accomplished I guess.

Hangover 2 Nothing can cure this too familiar Hangover BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 May 25 2011 (...) handout/court docs A character from ""The Hangover Part II"" with a tattoo similar to Mike Tysons. Take it from someone who knows Bangkok is full of cheap knockoffs. You unwrap a pretty package get a nasty surprise and realize all the money has been sucked out of your pocket.Wastrels think the formula for a hangover is the hair of the dog but this flaccid follow-up to the hit comedy expects us to swallow the entire rotting carcass. For such a brazen act of counterfeiting writer and director Todd Phillips belongs in a Thai prison.Buyer beware The only difference between the genuinely fresh original and this shamelessly repackaged sequel is the setting two years later. Once again its a rude awakening for weekend warrior Phil (Bradley Cooper) sensible dentist Stu (Ed Helms) and needy weirdo Alan (Zach Galifianakis) as they find themselves in a trashed hotel room with no memory of the night before. Once again Stu is disfigured. And once again a member of their wedding party has been kidnapped. As they hunt for clues about how they got to Bangkok from the beach resort where Stu is supposed to marry his Thai sweetheart the next day the three groggy Americans are greeted by people who seem to know them. Sound familiar yet?Taking no chances Phillips even reintroduces crazed criminal Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) and the scene-stealing actor who ran the wedding-chapel in the first movie (Bryan Callen now playing a gun-running pimp).Vicarious thrill-seekers might be misled by the locale but in lieu of world-class debauchery the drunken flashbacks are enacted by children (and until the obligatory end-credit slide show the nudity is exclusively male). At its best especially when Alan is blurting his sick sentiments the humor is amusingly familiar like another installment of a lowbrow serial. (You could call this one ""The Three Stooges Meet the Transvestite Hooker."") But its clear that Phillips is betting heavily on funnymen Jeong and Galifianakis to hide his creative bankruptcy.As Mr. Chow might say its called doubling down.

The Hangover Part II Bad to fair Director Todd Phillips. Cast Bradley Cooper Ed Helms Zach Galifianakis Justin Bartha. Rating R for pervasive language strong sexual content including graphic nudity drug use and brief violent images. This weeks new movie releases Movies about weddings Travel movies R-rated comedies This isnt even really a sequel to the hilarious 2009 comedy smash set in Las Vegas. Its virtually the same movie just transferred to another continent and with the raunch wildly amped up. This time the gang journeys to Thailand where meek dentist Stu (Ed Helms) is planning to wed his beautiful fiancee (Jamie Chung). The guys include Phil (Bradley Cooper) slimier than in the first film; Alan (Zach Galifianakis) even dimmer than he was previously; and Doug (Justin Bartha) who again sits out most of the action. In the first movie the guys took roofies which started off a night of wild debauchery. Here they ingest tainted marshmallows. In the original film they wound up hauling around a baby; this time its a chain-smoking monkey. They previously were tasered by cops; now theyre beat with a club by monks. Essentially though its the same story. The members of our trio wake up in various states of distress with one of the guys missing. They need to piece together what happened the previous night in order to locate their missing pal - in this case its Stus future brother-in-law (Mason Lee). The movie goes absurdly out of its way to recreate the patterns of the first film. Again Tainted marshmallows? The lazy cut-and-paste feel gives the entire project a bored been-there-done-that quality. Its probably not surprising that the writers from the first film arent involved in the screenplay; instead its handled by guys who labored on ""Scary Movie 4"" and ""School for Scoundrels"" Director Todd Phillips also worked on the script. He helmed the first ""Hangover"" but he just cant recreate the whacked-out energy or the element of surprise. For instance the first movie had a cameo by Mike Tyson; this film features (spoiler alert) Nick Cassavetes. There are laughs but the stretches between them grow longer as the film goes on. That leaves the movie to coast by on leftover goodwill. In this case that only goes so far as even Galifianakis man-child act is starting to wear out its welcome.

B+ The Hangover Part II Starring Bradley Cooper Zach Galifianakis Ed Helms; Director Todd Phillips; Author Scot Armstrong Craig Mazin Todd Phillips; Release Date Wide 05/26/2011; Runtime (in minutes) 102; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted June 6 2011 -- 1200 AM EDT A shaved head. A severed finger. A Bangkok hotel room thats cruddy enough to be a crack den. A screaming monkey in a Rolling Stones blue-jean vest. A Mike Tyson Maori tattoo freshly etched around the eye of Stu (Ed Helms) the polite dentist whos the one getting married this time. In The Hangover Part II the cleverly structured pretty funny sequel to Todd Phillips 2009 what-happens-in-Vegas megahit The Hangover those are the mysterious WTF clues to whatever happened the night before to sharkish presentable Phil (Bradley Cooper) reckless half-wit Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and sweet repressed Stu. Once again the characters -- and the audience -- have to work backward to find out what exactly put the trio known as the Wolfpack in this sorry and dazed predicament. And once again the movie hypes the sleazy dangerous thrill of three ordinary schmoes on a bender and shrewdly domesticates it at the same time. This much we know They all traveled to a seaside resort in Thailand for Stus wedding to Lauren (Jamie Chung) whose father hates his future son-in-law so much that during a toast at the rehearsal dinner he pays him a ""compliment"" by comparing him to comfortably plain soggy white rice. (Thats just the kind of goofy-misanthropic 80s-style joke that Phillips thrives on.) Stu having learned about the perils of intoxication in The Hangover after he extracted one of his own incisors insists on no bachelor party. And so the trio accompanied by Laurens studious teenage brother Teddy (Mason Lee) meet on the beach for a campfire and a beer?but end up in this post-mayhem dilemma anyway. The next day Teddy is nowhere to be found (though that sliced-off digit appears to be his). But the guys do find Mr. Chow the English-mangling gangster played in both films by Ken Jeong with such wackadoo exuberance that you can almost forgive the slight racism of the character. (Lets be honest Hes a badass version of Long Duk Dong from Sixteen Candles.) Chow is now practically part of the Wolfpack himself -- at least until he takes a snort of cocaine and collapses. Here as in The Hangover the laughs arent just staged theyre superlatively engineered -- even if that means at moments that they feel like theyre falling into formatted slots. When they dont the movie can be flat-out ? hilarious. As the guys begin their desperate search for a missing bank account number (they have to give it to a drug lord or hell kill them) its no surprise to discover that they went to a Bangkok strip bar. And when we learn what happened in that club to Stu -- who hasnt shaken his tendency to fall drunkenly head over heels in love with hookers -- you may see the twist coming but you wont foresee the casual outrageousness of the dialogue the kind that keeps on giving. Yet that sort of choke-on-your-popcorn laugh is more the exception than the rule. Like the first film The Hangover Part II comes on as a slapstick orgy of naughtiness but ? beneath that the movie is a reassuringly conventional comic detective story in which most of the fun lies in piecing the evidence of debauchery together. And that at least to me tends to produce chuckles rather than major guffaws. Still Phillips keeps the whole thing popping and the clogged smoggy Bangkok setting with its layered skeeziness and depravity lends the picture a vivid squalor that grounds the laughs in reality a notch more than Vegas did. On those festering streets of sin anything can happen -- and does. Paul Giamatti screams (winningly) as a big-shot crime boss and a car chase is as madly jacked as the one in Doug Limans Go. Now that we know them the core characters are all the funnier; theyve become an American suburban version of the Three Stooges. Cooper the voice of exasperated sanity plays Phil with great addled double takes and Helms as the frazzled neurotic Stu puts his rage and anxiety gleefully close to the surface. Even more than before Zach Galifianakis is the wild card. Looking like a prison-camp mongrel with his shaved head he makes Alan an overgrown damaged child with a screw loose You never know what hell say next yet somehow it all connects. I wouldnt call The Hangover Part II a message movie but it has a saucy redemptive vibe It says that sometimes the only way to grow up is to act as badly as you possibly can and come out the other side. And to vow -- nudge nudge -- never to do it again.

Trade out Las Vegas for Bangkok a tiger for a monkey a lactating hooker for a trannie stripper a missing tooth for a face tattoo and youve got Todd Phillipss rote dispiriting replica of his own surprise smash hit. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Last time it was bland bro Doug (Justin Bartha) who got lost on a Vegas rooftop the morning of his own wedding and now its straight man Stu (Ed Helms) who gets derailed the Friday before his destination nuptials in Thailand. Stu tries to avoid the inevitable but once pretty boy Phil (Bradley Cooper) cajoles him into a late-night beer by the bonfire and man-child moron Alan (Zach Galifianakis) laces the marshmallows with roofies (again) its blackout time. When they awake Alan has been shaved bald Stu is adorned with the aforementioned Tyson tattoo and theres a denim-vested monkey chain-smoking and bouncing around a grim Bangkok hotel room.Dougs not missing--hes actually resting back at the resort safely out of harms (and the plots) way--but Stus soon-to-be brother-in-law Teddy (Mason Lee) an underaged overachieving teen prodigy certainly is. Phil marshals the trio to action which leads to whiplash-inducing discoveries and shittier snafus involving everything from gunplay to inadvertent sodomy. Paul Giamatti shows up as a bug-eyed heavy as does the tiny-peckered gansta-cocky Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong)--a repeat of his aggressively irritating one-man 21st-century chopsocky minstrel show. ""Bangkok has him now"" declares a glowering tattoo artist (Nick Cassavetes) about lost Teddy. ""And shell never let him go."" She will of course but not before the trio proves worthy of her seedy charms.Boffo BO or no whats surprising about Roman Numeral Two is how thoroughly unfunny it is. Its so committed to being exactly what we expect it to be and to thrusting harder against the envelope of bad taste that it fails in this most basic sense. Though overrated and ultimately more clever than inventive the best thing about The Hangover was its double-backed amnesiatic script which recast a men-behaving-badly yarn as a madcap mystery-adventure. Yet Part II fatally honors the originals premise like its a sacred text retracing idiotic hijinks like theyre stations of the cross forsaking its spirit of danger and giddy unpredictability in favor of a vainglorious victory lap (tellingly original screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore had nothing to do with the sequel which Phillips penned with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong). So the very thing that made the first film feel fresh turns the sequel stale. If you played them side by side I swear Ed Helmss horrified howls would harmonize.Phillips again shoots his dude comedy as if it were a widescreen epic but this time instead of a welcome expression for a Hollywood comedy of aesthetic proficiency hes putting fancy clothes on a mewling incontinent infant. It only gets messier from there as all energies are focused on going further harder uglier. Scarecrow Coopers cad act worsens into an active courting of our revulsion blithely tossing off misogynist declarations and racist rejoinders with his wide weasel-grin and sleeve-rolled arms ever akimbo. Tin man Helms works hard to give the film a heart but his every line reading passes through gated teeth and a character-killing affect filter while furry lion Galifianakis asked to shoulder the weight of the funny turns his inappropriate loner into a full-on queasy-making misanthrope. Meanwhile Phillips treats the host city to Uzi fire General Lee-like car jumps pig splatter and piles on the penile sight-gags. ""Theres a reason they dont call this Bang-cunt"" says Stus bodacious tranny ass-rammer--but if only it was otherwise. Outside of fleeting shots of primping wives and requisite end-credit snapshots of skank-crotch this is strictly a dudes playground no Dorothys allowed.Like any fantasy The Hangover offered indulgence without consequence--so long as the trio showed up for the wedding all was forgiven. But Part II actually tries to heroicize regressive partying. ""Theres a demon in me"" says Stu with a speedboat trenched on the lawn behind him . . . and his skeptical father-in-law finally approves. Which clarifies where Phillips lost the plot and worse his comedy. When clowns become kings the jokes on us.1 See its funny because Im Asian.Melinda Sue Gordon Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Eric Hynes Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Can this really be happening again? Todd Phillipss sequel to (remake of?) his rude adult comedy about a stag night snafu is not so much more of the same as exactly the same but set in Bangkok and minus the laughs.During their Vegas bachelor night debauch Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) lost the groom on the eve of his wedding; this time they lose the Thai brides innocent 16-year-old brother on the eve of her marriage to Stu. Last time the trio found a baby in their trashed hotel room; this time they get to babysit a capuchin monkey. Previously dentist Stu lost a tooth and married a stripper; on this occasion he gets a facial tattoo and is butt-fucked by a transvestite hooker. The camp angry Mr Chow (Ken Jeong) sprang from the locked boot of their car; the hotels locked ice machine serves the same function here.The generic car chases and gunplay - involving Russian gangsters a sinister wheeler-dealer (Paul Giamatti) and Mr Chows dodgy dealings - are contrived and unexciting. Since the dialogue isnt funny everyone overacts to make up for the lack of humour or threat. Together with co-writers Scot Armstrong and Craig Mazin director Phillips serves up a tasteless warmed-over version of the same dish spiced with local Thai colour. Also despite a predictably sweet happy ending the scripts homophobia and racial stereotyping leave a sour aftertaste.

Overall it was an entertaining comedy but not a true classic in the tradition of Hangover. I find it very disappointing that the outstanding Hangover should be followed by such an average middle-of-the-road offering but its still worth viewing. My friend (who had not seen Hangover) really enjoyed Hangover II despite the fact that Hangover II references Hangover in a number of places effectively creating in-jokes which my friend was excluded from. ... Why does the official review contain so many spoilers? Also this movie does not have racist or homophobic undertones and whilst it follows the same general format as the previous film its certainly not a carbon copy of it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJun 5 2011TRUTHTELLER.FeaturedIgnore the movie police who want to have every film judged by whether it makes a social statement gives us a lecture or tries to shove their its down out throat  whereas the rest of us just go the movies to be entertained.

(From left) Zach Galifianakis Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms appear to just say Phuket as Helms wedding in Thailand approaches.       Photo (From left) BRADLEY COOPER KEN JEONG ED HELMS and ZACH GALIFIANAKIS try to put the fun in perfunctory with this awfully famillar sequel. ( ) Not generally the biggest fan of gross-out humor I found ""The Hangover"" gut-bustingly funny -- it re-invented the form with an unpredictable subversive take-no-prisoners approach that helped make it the most successful R-rated comedy of all time. While ""The Hangover Part II"" will inevitably also clean up I have the sad duty to report I found this more elaborate play-it-safe sequel far less fresh or funny. I know a lot of you have been eagerly anticipating this sequel but please dont shoot the messenger. The action has been transposed from Las Vegas to a far more picturesque (and dangerous) Bangkok where director Todd Phillips and his co-screenwriters struggle to recapture the original magic sometimes copying the original scene for scene. And truthfully the formerly delightful twisted camaraderie between the three leads -- Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis -- seems more mechanical this time around. PHOTOS BRADLEY COOPERS RISE TO STARDOM This time Helms is the bridegroom-to-be and hes taking no chances after the chaos that preceded Justin Barthas nuptials in the original. In lieu of a bachelor party he holds a brunch at IHOP (one of countless product placements). Helms even vows not to invite the mischief-making Galifianakis to his wedding which is being hosted by the parents of Helms fiancee (Jamie Chung in the only female role that approaches any consequence) in their native Thailand. Of course Helms bows to pressure from his pals to include Galifianakis -- obviously a big mistake. One moment theyre sharing beers on the beach at a resort with the fiancees 16-year-old brother (Mason Lee). The next thing you know Cooper Helms and Galifianakis have woken up with hangovers in a seedy Bangkok hotel room with an alarmed Bartha calling from the resort. Galifianakis head has been shaved and Helms has a face tattoo just like Mike Tysons. Even more alarmingly Helms prospective brother-in-law is missing except for his ring finger. Ken Jeongs effeminate gangster is back and begins to explain what happened the night before after his obligatory full-frontal nude scene. Then he keels over prompting the panicked guys to stash him in an ice machine while they frantically search for the brides missing teenage brother. Anyone whos seen the original should be able to anticipate what follows well in advance. The dudes adventures involve a capuchin monkey Russian drug dealers a transvestite prostitute a rival gangster (an underutilized Paul Giamatti) and a fairly exciting car chase. Also figuring in are a tattoo artist (a role intended for Mel Gibson shot with Liam Neeson and reshot with Nick Cassavetes) -- and Tyson singing a particularly excruciating version of ""One Night in Bangkok."" There are definitely laughs to be had even if the three leads often seem to be going through the motions. This is especially true of the tired-looking Galifianakis the first films breakout star whose character this time around seems a lot less outrageous than Jeong who has been given a much larger role. It says a lot that the movies funniest lines are delivered not by them but by Nirut Sirichanya as the disapproving father of Helms fiancee. ""The Hangover Part II"" is certainly watchable. And probably good enough for laugh-starved audiences if the grosses for ""Bridesmaids"" are any indication. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Dentist and a patients cheat tooth Read Next Dentist and a patients cheat tooth Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 40527 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20897 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops 13811 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

E-mail| Print| Text size - + Its hard to imagine a more half-assed attempt at cashing in a second time than ""The Hangover Part II.""Seriously it feels like the script was pieced together with the help of Mad Libs with only slightly different and raunchier details replacing those that helped the original ""Hangover"" from 2009 become the highest-grossing R-rated comedy of all time (it made more than 467 million worldwide).But so much of the allure of that first film was the novelty of the premise the unpredictability of the adventures and the sense that we too were wandering in a daze helping solve the mystery of the debauched night before. Despite their throbbing heads and increasing sense of panic these guys clearly had a blast and they made us wish we could have joined them. That sequence where the motley group of friends wakes up in a fog and surveys the damage in a trashed Las Vegas hotel suite is a brilliant and efficient little piece of storytelling full of clever details and meticulous production design.Director Todd Phillips who also co-wrote the script this time (along with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong) apparently thought so too. Thats just one of many gags from the first film that are repeated in ""The Hangover Part II."" Giving the people what they want is one thing. Making nearly the exact same movie a second time but shifting the setting to Thailand is just ... what lazy? Arrogant? Maybe a combination of the two.Instead of finding a baby in their hotel room the guys find a chain-smoking drug-running capuchin monkey. Instead of waking up with a missing tooth Ed Helms mild-mannered dentist character Stu wakes up with a facial tattoo. Instead of bursting into song at the piano to sum up how horrible the situation is Stu bursts into song with an acoustic guitar. And instead of having sex with a hooker with a heart of gold Stu does it with ... well we wont tell you. Suffice it to say this is Thailand so its not that huge of a shock.Bradley Cooper is also back as the groups de facto leader the arrogant Phil as is Zach Galifianakis as the passive aggressive man-child Alan. Galifianakis dark off-kilter shtick made him the breakout star of the original film and while he gets many of the best lines here hes also even more infuriating.Justin Bartha is along too but just barely; as Doug the groom in the first film he was missing the entire time. In the sequel he remains safely ensconced at the groups luxury seaside resort so he misses out on yet another wild night. While theres less of him theres also more of Ken Jeongs character the obnoxious effeminate gangster Mr. Chow. He was the weakest part of the first ""Hangover"" and gets even more face time here with no improvement.Theyre all there for the wedding of Stu and the beautiful Lauren (Jamie Chung) in her parents home country. He insists he doesnt want the kind of crazy bachelor party that resulted when Doug got married but he gives in and agrees to have one beer -- in a sealed container -- on the beach with his friends. Joining them is Laurens younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee) a 16-year-old Stanford pre-med student and cello prodigy.Naturally the guys all wake up in the squalor of a Bangkok hotel (shot in a tangible grimy steaminess by Lawrence Sher) absolutely blanking as to what they did the previous night. Again. And yes that word appears a lot in the script as in ""I cant believe this is happening again""We can.""The Hangover Part II"" a Warner Bros Pictures release is rated R for pervasive language strong sexual content including graphic nudity drug use and brief violent images.

The stock dismissal ""more of the same"" has rarely been more accurately applied to a sequel than to ""The Hangover Part II"" which ranks as little more than a faded copy of its predecessor superimposed on a more brightly colored background. One can understand director Todd Phillips initial reluctance to tinker with a formula that made the 2009 romp the highest-grossing R-rated comedy ever but the rote professionalism on display verges on cynicism and despite some occasional sparks this ranks as a considerable disappointment. Box office should be huge all the same. No doubt rebooting the original pics high-concept hijinks must have presented Phillips (as well as new screenwriters Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong) with considerable challenges in terms of keeping things fresh. But it nonetheless should have been possible to revive the basic plot structure without slavishly reprising its every beat. This ""Hangover"" is longer than the first by two minutes but at times it feels as though the two could be projected side-by-side in perfect synchronicity with the only changes to many scenes being the location the wardrobe and the addition of the word ""again"" to the dialogue. Missing this time is the Las Vegas location Rachael Harris Heather Graham and a substantial percentage of the twisted wit that made the first such an unexpected pleasure. Emphasis on the word ""unexpected"" as the primary achievement of the first ""Hangover"" was its ability to keep topping itself with delightfully tasteless outrages. Relocation of the characters to ugly-American capital Bangkok would seem to indicate a raising of the stakes in that regard but aside from a breathtakingly offensive half-second snapshot in the closing-credits montage this one plays it relatively safe. Again best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug (Justin Bartha) come together on the eve of a wedding -- along with fourth wheel Alan (Zach Galifianakis) -- though this time the groom-to-be is Stu and the nuptials are set for a spectacular seaside resort in Thailand. The father (Nirut Sirichanya) of the bride (Jamie Chung) is hardly a fan of the milquetoast dentist especially when hes stacked up against his son Teddy (Mason Lee) a 16-year-old Stanford freshman and cello prodigy. After a disastrous rehearsal-dinner speech the four amigos with Teddy in tow head down to the beach to share a single beer only to wake up sweaty and confused in a sleazy Bangkok hotel. Alans head is now shaved Stu boasts a raw tribal tattoo on his face and Teddy has gone missing save for his ring finger preserved in ice on a bedstand table. (Doug is again absent from the morning after though this time hes safely back at the resort.) From here the film is consumed by a clock-beating mad dash to piece together the fragments of the unremembered evening and find the missing teenager. This journey takes them into the orbit of a local crime lord (Paul Giamatti) a drug-dealing monkey effeminate gangster Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong again) an American tattooist (Nick Cassavetes) and of course Mike Tyson (again). Some of these misadventures are quite funny some flop with a thud but few of them possess more than a shred of the anything-goes inventiveness that the film requires. One exception to this is the gangs inevitable visit to a Bangkok brothel which actually manages to subvert audience expectations while at the same time further diminishing the films already minimal female presence. Helms and Cooper have no trouble reprising their roles and as in the original manage to subtly convey why such diametrically opposed personalities might be such close friends. Galifianakis looks a bit lost however as his socially maladjusted character seems to be progressively devolving from welcome X-factor into low-grade irritant. Sirichanya on the other hand completely nails the films sharpest moment of cringe-worthy hilarity delivering a monologue in which he laboriously attempts to compliment his future son-in-law by comparing him first to a developmentally disabled relative then to a flavorless rice porridge. Production design is of a particularly high quality capturing the crowded humid ambiance of the Bangkok streets as well as the smaller details -- the Billy Joel posters hanging in Alans bedroom draw more laughs than many of the madcap setpieces. Editing and camerawork are solid and one expertly executed car chase is a blast on its own merits. The Hangover Part IIProductionA Warner Bros.

TWITTER Bradley Cooper Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis return for the follow-up taking place in Bangkok two years after the hugely successful Las Vegas-set 2009 film. Having boosted the bar for R-rated comedies with that outrageous blast of fresh air that was 2009s The Hangover -- and earning more than 467 million worldwide in the process -- its understandable that director Todd Phillips didnt want to mess too much with success. As a result even though the The Hangover Part II trades Vegas for Bangkok venturing farther afield hasnt translated into a livelier excursion. That comfortable air of familiarity provided by the returning characters also extends to many of the originals more inspired bits -- but to less potent effect. Still even a milder Hangover manages to deliver more laughs than most of the competition and audiences primed for the further misadventures of Phil (Bradley Cooper) Stu (Ed Helms) Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and company should ensure that the picture has a memorable Memorial Day weekend kickoff. The new script penned by Phillips along with Craig Mazin and Scot Armstrong picks up two years after the debacle that was Dougs (Justin Bartha) bachelor party. This time around its dentist Stu whos about to tie the knot with the lovely Lauren (Jamie Chung) in her parents home country of Thailand. Despite ultracautious Stus best intentions history nonetheless repeats itself after a harmless seaside toast to the groom goes apparently terribly wrong -- with the boys having to retrace the steps that landed them in a fleabag Bangkok Hotel along with a chain-smoking capuchin monkey. They have also awakened to a shaved head a Mike Tyson tattoo and the ring finger (complete with ring) belonging to Laurens younger brother Teddy (Mason Lee) minus its bearer. Although the ensuing Bangkok adventure is not without its shocking laugh-out-loud moments too much of Part II seems content to trot out variations on the earlier bits like your joke-cracking uncle who believes that any punch line that gets a chuckle the first time bears repeating -- over and over again. In addition to that hard-to-replicate element of surprise also in short supply here is the manic energy that made the original such a delightfully unpredictable ride. The reunited cast looks to have been up for a greater challenge especially gonzo Galifianakis who emerged as the breakout star of the first Hangover. Although he once again makes off with some of the healthier laughter as the certifiably odd Alan -- a self-described ""stay-at-home son"" -- this time around a chunk of his thunder has been stolen by Ken Jeong back as jive-talking Asian gangsta Mr. Chow. Also doing her share of scene-stealing is Crystal that streetwise capuchin (PETA take note All the ""smoking"" sequences were CGI-created) who previously shared the screen with Cooper in 2006s Failure to Launch. Those exotic Thai backdrops also play an evocative role thanks to Lawrence Shers vivid cinematography; as does Phillips customarily eclectic song selection running the gamut from Kanye to Billy Joel and allowing for a little encore from a certain retired heavyweight champion.
