By Peter Rainer October 24 2008 Save for later Saved Colin Farrell (l.) is a New York City cop in Pride and Glory which explores conflicting loyalties in a police investigation. Courtesy of New line cinema          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Pride and Glory"" is an underpowered movie with a powerhouse cast. Because of studio politics it is just now being released after languishing for two years on the shelf. No wonder. Its yet another movie about familial strife in the New York City Police Department. If you think youve seen it all before you have.Jon Voight plays top cop Francis Tierney Sr. whose two sons Ray (Edward Norton) and Francis Jr. (Noah Emmerich) as well as his son-in-law Jimmy (Colin Farrell) are all on the force. When four New York cops are killed in what at first looks to be a routine drug bust Francis Sr. puts Ray on the case even though the murdered cops served under Francis Jr. and beside Jimmy. This glaring conflict of interest doesnt seem to rankle anybody but Ray who rightly suspects the investigation will end up fingering his brother and brother-in-law.In the real world Ray would likely not have been assigned this case at all or would staunchly have refused it. But this is Hollywood. Rays dilemma - should he serve the cause of justice or family? - becomes the crux of the melodrama. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? It would be easier to buy into this dilemma if director and co-writer Gavin OConnor - whose father was a New York cop - wasnt so keen on engineering a statement. The actors keyed up for greatness look as if theyre flailing about in a roadshow Eugene ONeill production. The overacting by Voight and Farrell is countered by the underacting of Norton and Emmerich. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Pride and Glory At times ""Pride and Glory"" seems to be about a war between actors not cops. Nobody comes off well.

"Fast paised - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Fast paisedOctober 24 2008|By MATT PAISHigh School Musical 3 Senior Year (G)With graduation looming Troy (Zac Efron) wonders if hell go to college for basketball or theater; Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) anticipates heading to Stanford and being away from Troy; and Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) schemes to score a Juilliard scholarship. Meanwhile Chad (Corbin Bleu) Taylor (Monique Coleman) Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) and the rest of the gang prep for prom and put on a musical about their impending life changes.The buzz Complaining that ""HSM"" is corny is like Santa Claus griping about long hours -- it comes with the territory.The verdict Yes half the lyrics would be at home on a Backstreet Boys record and Hudgens looks embarrassed when Gabriellas Troy-inspired swooning reaches new heights of cheeseballitude. But the series has grown up relatively speaking at last providing melodies that split the difference between stage tunes and pop radio as well as dance sequences that mix old-fashioned grace with modern pizzazz. (Efrons star shines the entire way.)Happy-Go-Lucky (R)London schoolteacher Poppy (Sally Hawkins) is full of life which inspires affection from some and skepticism from others. The film follows her as she hangs with her roommate/best friend (Alexis Zegerman) takes driving lessons from an angry teacher (Eddie Marsan) flirts with a social worker (Samuel Roukin) goes out drinking takes a dance class and chats with her sisters.The buzz This is a much much less gloomy affair than writer-director Mike Leighs last film 2004s ""Vera Drake"" and ""Happy"" is a particularly strange one in that theres barely any plot to summarize. Rather than serving as a film for people who want a clear conflict and resolution its a snapshot of one woman how she interacts with those around her and how they react to her.The verdict Prepare to have your batteries recharged. Absolutely extraordinary in its grounded optimism ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" features an Oscar-worthy performance from Hawkins that cannot be ignored. With the slightest grin or clench of the eyes Hawkins reveals exactly what makes Poppy tick in a way that feels like you know everything about her without actually knowing much at all. matt pais is metromix movies producer.ALSO OUT FRIDAY- ""Changeling"" See Pages 30-31- ""Pride and Glory"" See Page 35- ""Saw V"" did not screen for critics but go to metromix.com Friday afternoon for Matt Pais review of the film.- ""Passengers"" did not screen for critics.QUICK TAKEFilth and Wisdom (R)""The best part of Filth and Wisdom Madonnas (right) directorial debut is that its only 81 minutes long.

Pictures Warner Bros. Pictures Bad cop good cop Noah Emmerich left plays an officer whose principles have lapsed and Edward Norton lets him know about it. ABOUT THE MOVIE Pride and Glory 1/2 (out of four)Stars Edward Norton Colin Farrell Noah Emmerich Jon Voight Jennifer EhleDirector Gavin OConnorDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for strong violence pervasive language and brief drug contentRunning time 2 hours 5 minutesOpens Friday nationwide  WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its deja vu all over again. There isnt much more to say about We Own the Night 2. Oops make that Pride and Glory. Perhaps more than any other derivative film this year (and there are quite a few) Pride and Glory feels like something weve seen before. This good cop/crooked cop saga has been done right in The Departed. Prides only saving grace is Edward Norton whose mere presence raises the level of a film several notches. But its unclear why he lately has chosen such worn-out material. Norton plays a sharp NYPD detective with special skills in drawing out the right crime witnesses. He also is the scion of a hard-nosed chief of detectives (Jon Voight) and the brother of another cop (Noah Emmerich). Emmerichs character is essentially decent but he has let his principles slide. He is preoccupied understandably with worry over the well-being of his seriously ill wife (Jennifer Ehle). Colin Farrell plays the brother-in-law of Norton and Emmerich. When several police officers are killed Norton is assigned by his father to investigate. Isnt that some sort of conflict of interest? Its hard to believe this movie was made by Gavin OConnor who directed co-wrote and co-starred in the quirky mother-daughter road picture Tumbleweeds (1999). Save for the offputting cinematography it feels as if Pride could have been made by a computer program titled ""Generic cop drama."" Did we mention all this mayhem occurs around Christmas for some obvious symbolic juxtaposition? Apparently Pride and Glory finished shooting more than two years ago and its release date has been postponed a few times. Its no wonder. Blood-soaked and uninvolving this dark story is noteworthy only for its strong cast. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Pride and Glory These cops too late on the scene | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsPride and Glory These cops too late on the scenePride and Glory is a New York police corruption drama that boasts a strong ensemble cast - Edward Norton Colin Farrell Jon Voight and Noah Emmerich - but a lousy sense of timing.Colin Farrell left and Edward Norton are among the impressive cast in the disappointing and way-too-familar Pride and Glory.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 24 2008 Pride and Glory (out of 4)Starring Edward Norton Colin Farrell Jon Voight and Noah Emmerich. Directed by Gavin OConnor. 125 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Pride and Glory is a New York police corruption drama that boasts a strong ensemble cast - Edward Norton Colin Farrell Jon Voight and Noah Emmerich - but a lousy sense of timing.It sat on the shelves for two years while a superior film (The Departed) and a lesser one (We Own the Night) tracked the entanglements of the boys in blue. The films gala debut at the most recent Toronto International Film Festival did nothing to remove the stench of mothballs.Director Gavin OConnor co-wrote it with Joe Carnahan whose Narc followed a similar line. Theres nothing really wrong with Pride and Glory apart from an excessive degree of brutality but theres nothing terribly revelatory about it either.Its the way-too-familiar saga of cops banding together when the going gets tough even if that means acting as if theyre above the law.NYPD Det. Ray Tierney (Norton) is blue through and through. His brother Francis Jr. (Emmerich) and brother-in-law Jimmy (Farrell) are also on the force and his dad Francis (Voight) is the chief of Manhattan detectives and former chief of police. Ray is also blue in the emotional sense. He lives on a leaky houseboat hes on the verge of splitting with his wife and hes weighed down by memories of a case that went terribly wrong. A facial scar only hints at how torn-up he feels inside.Bonded by their Irish blood the Tierneys appear solid - we first meet the family at a celebratory football game - but a drug bust that turns into a bloodbath reveals hidden ruptures. There are four officers amongst the dead and fingers of blame point within the force and the family.Francis Sr. calls upon the reluctant Ray to investigate the case judging him sensitive enough to navigate the treacherous shoals of a case that threatens both family unity and the forces public image.""Anything that makes cops look culpable is no good Raymond"" Francis Sr. cautions his son.Other family members are busy with their own investigations of the crime and their intentions are not at all honorable. Anyone the least bit familiar with police stories needs no further exposition which includes the subplot melodrama of a family member suffering from terminal cancer.But even viewers steeled by repeat exposure to cop tales may find themselves wincing at this one which tries to substitute gratuitous violence for lack of insight. This is a nasty piece of work laced with profanity and including one scene involving a newborn baby and a hot iron that could ruin your entire day if not your week.Not for nothing does one of the films antagonists observe ""We tour the sewers.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

In this image released by Warner Bros. Colin Farrell left and Shea Whigham are shown in a scene from ""Pride and Glory."" Photo Glen Wilson Warner Bros. Movie review Pride and Glory has neither 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Pride and Glory Action drama. Starring Edward Norton Colin Farrell Jon Voight and Noah Emmerich. Directed by Gavin OConnor. (R. 125 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Derivative ugly and stupid. Sappy sentimental and maudlin. Long convoluted and opaque. Badly photographed pompous and fake. ""Pride and Glory"" is more than just lousy; its an amalgam of every bad tendency of the current cinema stitched together into a single 125-minute monstrosity of a cop movie. Intended as a hard-hitting crime drama about a family of Irish American policemen the film has no truth in it. The screenplay by Joe Carnahan and director Gavin OConnor tries to hide its schmaltziness under a cascade of f-words. Cant be done. The writing is phony mushy and goofy and having guys curse three times every sentence doesnt disguise it. Nor does the f-word avalanche make the story any more realistic when at its foundation its bogus goods a product of movie-watching not genuine observation. The first obvious miscue is the cinematography which takes the shaky handheld cliche and brings it into the realm of unintended parody A terrible crime has been committed. Four cops have been killed in an attempted drug bust. And so cinematographer Declan Quinn films the commotion at the scene in a way that seems as if hes running after the characters. Images dont even have time to shake into focus before shaking out of the frame. Its all just a big messy and ultimately laughable blur with characters talking to each other with great self-importance as Quinn films the back of their heads. By the way why is everything blue? The outdoors scenes as well as the indoor scenes that arent dark are just a wash of blue which robs the scenes of their point of focus. The visuals in ""Pride and Glory"" are so undifferentiated and so without center that oddly enough the movie actually becomes difficult to hear. The mind resists taking it in. And theres a lot to take in all right. For about 45 minutes we get a series of intense scenes in which characters talk about other characters and we have absolutely no idea what theyre talking about. This much we do know Edward Norton is a disillusioned detective investigating the murder of those four police officers. Noah Emmerich is his brother from whose squad the dead cops came. And Colin Farrell plays their brother-in-law also a cop but a dirty one. Hes way dirty in the sense that he augments his income by moonlighting as a paid murderer and drug dealer. Still on the surface he seems like any other gruff decent guy - albeit one whos about two hairs short of a unibrow. Also worthy of mention is Jon Voight as the patriarch of this clan of cops an old guy with old ideas. Voight has the best moment in the movie at a family dinner in which he goes into a drunken monologue about how wonderful his kids are. Voight a much better actor than hes ever given credit for does a lovely job of showing a simple guys self-delusion while also executing the technical aspect of playing mild euphoric drunkenness. He gives us the spectacle of an essentially stupid man who has told himself lies all his life but who at the same time really did try to do his best. All that in just one monologue. Unfortunately its only in that scene that a characters goopy sentiments are distinguishable from the movies own point of view. Lacking any discernible reason for making the movie the filmmakers try to pass off this family of pea-brains and goons as possessing some essential if tarnished nobility. But the characters are at best pathetic. Theyre not corrupted by power or the system; rather their mistakes are those of passivity dim-wittedness and venality. So their inner workings and anguish are of little interest. They dont have much going on inside anyway. On the plus side Norton is intrinsically interesting just standing there and Farrell shows an increasing command of the screen. But their presence cant counteract the sluggishness of the first hour or the absolute ridiculousness of the climax. Not just ridiculous in the sense of inviting scorn - were talking laugh-out-loud throw-things-at-the-screen stuff. -- Advisory Violence strong language.

(125 min.) Directed by Gavin OConnor. With Edward Norton Colin Farrell Noah Emmerich Jon Voight. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS The Tierneys have given a lot to New York. A father who slowly rose up the uniformed ranks of the police. Two sons -- and a daughters handsome husband -- all of whom put on the blue and the badge too and still go out every morning to keep the peace. A man couldnt be prouder of a family like that. Too bad only one of them has reason to be proud of himself. ""Pride and Glory"" wants to be one of those big sprawling ethnic crime stories about family and loyalty and duty. And it is mostly -- until a bad third-act detour when it turns into a cops-and-slobbers melodrama full of shouts and crying jags and the corniest fistfight since ""The Quiet Man."" Jon Voight -- in a performance thats a little sad only because it reminds you of how great he can be given the chance -- is the grand and slightly pickled patriarch; Noah Emmerich and Edward Norton are his sons (never mind that they look nothing alike). And Colin Farrell doing another of his frantic violent boyos -- time to give that cliche a rest lad -- is the outsider who married the family beauty. Emotionally Emmerich is the underestimated son and Norton is the tortured but brilliant moralist; Voight is the protect-your-own papa and Farrell is the unpredictable hothead. And once you see thats the mix -- and a murky mystery about dirty cops and a suspicious shootout is introduced -- you know how the whole things going to turn out. The problem is that takes two hours. And not all of that time is spent profitably. There are a few nasty touches (including the most strung-out junkies since ""Fort Apache the Bronx"") and bizarre details (in a pinch it seems a raw potato makes a handy silencer). And the performances are mostly brilliant -- Norton has several good scenes with Voight as they go toe-to-toe and work their way through all sorts of father-and-son conflicts. But the script by director Gavin OConnor (and brutalist Joe Carnahan who also wrote ""Narc"" and ""Smokin Aces"") is far more interested in violence than in the intricacies of police work or politics and OConnor doesnt know where to put the camera except as close to the blood and gore as possible. (In a film filled with shootouts and chases there isnt a single stand-out action sequence.) He also overstuffs the movie with more moods than an Irish wake. One character has a broken marriage; another has a wife dying of cancer; a third is pretty much a stumbling alcoholic. None of this is really developed; it just decorates the film like mourning ribbons an outward sign of the filmmakers seriously morose intentions. Its bearable for two acts but eventually sensation overtakes sense. Perhaps the clearest evidence comes in a climactic scene in which the best cop and the worst cop confront each other. The good cop has the drop on the villain; all he needs to do is make him put his hands out cuff him and march him down to the station. But does he do that? He does not. No instead he makes the criminal put his badge and gun on the table. Then he puts his own badge and gun on the table. And then fists cocked like a couple of John L. Sullivans they engage in a manly bout of fisticuffs while Irish songs blare. Tis the only way men like themselves could settle such a thing dont you see now? No I dont. Although by this point I was getting close to taking a couple of swings myself. Ratings note The film contains brutal violence and strong language.

Thats a relief. You mean New York City cops dont walk into delis in daylight beat the innocent guy behind the counter into a stupor and shove a gun in his face - all while the store security camera presumably records the whole thing and anyone could be walking by outside? Edward Norton plays Ray a (possibly) honest cop wearing an unexplained scar positioned just so on his cheek. It looks like it was bought in the markdown aisle of Halloween Mart on Nov. 1. After four officers are gunned down Ray is assigned to investigate the case by his dad (Jon Voight) a department mainstay who advises him ""You keep the rage cut the rest of it."" Isnt that getting it backward? ""Son drop your calm assessment of the facts but be sure to be angry."" ""Keep the rage cut the rest"" sounds more like a manual for talk-radio hosts. Nortons brother-in-law Jimmy (Colin Farrell) yet another cop in the family isnt protecting and serving the people of Gotham quite as well as he should be. He is involved in a drug ring. Early on he and his fellow dirty cops find a car containing a dead suspect and torch it - just below a bridge that certainly makes for a picturesque setting but from which presumably hundreds of drivers will notice the fireball and the police car nearby. When the writers went to the Dialogue Store it must have been closed because they loaded their cart from whatever they found in the Dumpster out back. Can one movie really contain all of these lines? Not just ""Im doing what I have to do"" and ""Its just like ridin a bicycle - you never forget ridin a bicycle"" but also ""Im right in the middle of something I dont know how to get out of."" Most of the rest of the lines are so bad that the script desperately tries to save them with a word that isnt ""freak"" but begins and ends the same way. So we get lines much like ""Laugh you freakin scumbag"" and ""What the freak is going on here?"" and ""Ill slit your throat freak your wife and kill your kid"" and ""You broke my freakin heart Jimmy"" and ""Get your freakin hands off me"" and ""He looked pretty freakin dead"" Nortons brother another cop is played by Noah Emmerich. Emmerich and Norton resemble each other about as closely as Richie Cunningham resembled the Fonz but one of the immutable laws of Hollywood is that Emmerich must appear in all films made by New Line Cinema. Would it be relevant to point out that Emmerichs brother Toby was the New Line executive who keeps hiring him? Nah. That would imply that Hollywood is a corrupt institution one in which secret deals are cut behind closed doors because blood loyalty is everything . . . Hey wait a minute I have an idea for a movie. PRIDE AND GLORY Cop schlock. Running time 125 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity drug references). At the 84th Street 34th Street Kips Bay others.

After four NYPD cops are killed in a drug bust in Washington Heights Officer Ray Tierney (Edward Norton) is assigned by his police chief father (Jon Voight) to the internal affairs force investigating the slaughter. But Ray has a progressively messy situation on his hands The slain officers served under his older brother (Noah Emmerich) a precinct head and alongside his flash-tempered brother-in-law Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell). RELATED FARRELL AND NORTON TALK TO NEWS As he digs deeper Ray finds Jimmy is the center of a crew of bad apples who intimidate rob and bully the neighborhood and who are linked to a powerful drug dealer. Ray whos been out of duty since he himself was caught under fire some years earlier wants to do the right thing but must first face down his dads demands and his familys reputation. OConnor and his co-writer brother Gregory OConnor clearly know the blue wall they write about. However boiling their story down to a Shakespearean clump of clan loyalty doesnt serve the movies grander ambitions. (And giving Emmerichs character a wife nobly suffering from cancer is simply piling on the tragedy.) RELATED ""PRIDE amp; GLORY"" SAVED BY WARNER BROTHERSThough a certain amount of gruffness is expected in a movie like this there are a few too many scenes of guys getting grabbed by the collar and pushed against a wall until they talk and one moment with a newborn baby being threatened is simply hard to watch. Norton again rises above his deep-thinking persona and wiry physical presence as he did in ""American History X"" ""Fight Club"" and ""25th Hour"" to find a noirish heaviness (this movie was shot prior to summers ""The Incredible Hulk"" which unfortunately reduced him to a cartoons shadow). RELATED COLIN FARRELL IS A LITTLE GUN-SHY And while Farrells sneering black sheep and Voights lion in winter are cliches for both this genre and the actors Emmerich (""Little Children"" ""Miracle"") plays his precinct chiefs tortured moral score-keeping close to the vest. ""Pride and Glory"" could have used more of his kind of restraint. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Its storytelling is adult gripping real and substantive. It sweeps us into a frenetic world of street killings ruthless revenge and moral ambiguity filmed in a style that effectively evokes an urban battlefield. A gritty thriller in the bloodline of Sidney Lumets compelling New York City cop stories ""Serpico"" ""Prince of the City"" and ""Dog Day Afternoon"" it also offers deeper meaning for anyone willing to look for it. In the first act four cops are massacred in a drug bust gone sour. Or was it? The focus of the film is the Tierney clan a multigenerational cop family caught between their loyalty to kin and commitment to ethics. Chief of Manhattan Detectives Francis Tierney Sr. (Jon Voight) coaxes his son Detective Ray Tierney (Edward Norton) to lead the investigation into the quadruple homicide. Brave sweet and woeful Ray is literally and emotionally scarred from a violent case in his past. Hes reluctant to trade his office assignment for life on the front line but when Francis leans on Rays sense of duty he agrees. The inquiry ought to run smoothly. His brother Francis Jr. (Noah Emmerich) is commanding officer of the ambushed cops precinct and their brother-in-law Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell) knew the slain men well. But this is a world where nothing can be trusted and almost everything is unexpected. As Ray digs deeper into the bloodbath informers start divulging information that makes fellow officers look culpable. So many cops are on the take extorting money from drug dealers and shopkeepers alike that it seems impossible to settle the case without damaging the departments shaky reputation raising tensions on the street and putting more officers in peril. Soon enough powerful figures are arguing that the truth ought to be buried with the slain officers. And Ray who fractured a longtime relationship when he last compromised his police work refuses to play ball. There are life-and-death issues at stake but the characters face profound quandaries with no simple right or wrong way out. Rather than deal in cut-and-dried certitudes the film requires us to consider why these dark and conflicted characters got to where they are. The film draws sharp contrasts between the unbridled evil of the street and the haven of family life. There are touching scenes of Francis Sr. offering a tipsy toast to his adult children at a Christmas dinner moved almost to tears by his pride in their accomplishments. As Francis Jr.s bald cancer-stricken wife Abby Jennifer Ehle is remarkable turning her husband down the correct path despite her illness or perhaps because of it. Farrell all cocky machismo in uniform reveals a tender side in scenes with his wife Megan (Lake Bell) but withholds secrets that undermine their trust and endanger their marriage. PRIDE amp; GLORY  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for strong violence pervasive language and brief drug content. ""Pride amp; Glory"" examines the hazy distinction between whats OK and whats legal in police work the damage done to human dignity by impersonal violence the question of how far the law can be bent in the name of enforcement detailing a proud and glorious police force descending into a nightmare of moral ambiguity indistinguishable from madness.

"Pride and Glory (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Pride and Glory (R)  These plot thieves should be ashamed. In this image released by Warner Bros. Edward Norton is shown in a scene from ""Pride and Glory."" Photo AP/Warner Bros. Glen Wilson. Share Print Save to your profile Heading into a screening of Pride and Glory a fellow critic remarked the plot sounded suspiciously similar to We Own the Night director James Grays drama from last year about two embattled brothers -- one a cop the other a miscreant -- whose father was a decorated NYPD veteran. No in this one both of the brothers are cops I replied only a little facetiously. ``So its completely different. As it turns out I was right. The plot of Pride and Glory does not bear much overt resemblance to We Own the Night. Instead its lifted from pretty much every movie or TV show youve ever seen about police corruption only not done as well. Even the weakest episode of TVs The Shield owns Pride and Glory outright This is the kind of movie so relentlessly derivative you can figure out the turns and surprises awaiting in the script by Joe Carnahan (NarcSmokin Aces) and Gavin OConnor (Tumbleweeds) just five minutes into the story. OConnor who also directed Pride and Glory is the son of a New York City detective but the expected insiders perspective adds nothing new to the films depiction of good cops vs. bad ones. In fact Pride and Glory often feels cartoonish and overblown as in the way the movie depicts officers shaking down neighborhood bodega owners like two-bit punks. What makes Pride and Glory bearable are its performances. Edward Norton an actor who brings gravity and weight to each of his movies stars as detective Ray Tierney whose investigation into the shooting of four police officers during a drug bust leads to evidence that puts him at odds with his brother Francis (Noah Emmerich) the commander of the murdered cops; their veteran officer father (Jon Voight) who operates under the police mantra of We protect our own. That is all I know; and his loose cannon brother-in-law Jimmy (Colin Farrell) who worked alongside one of the dead men and is leading his own off-the-record scorched-Earth hunt for the killer Vic Mackey style. The cast keeps Pride and Glory which was shot in a murky blue-and-black palette by Declan Quinn (Rachel Getting Married) from sinking completely into its swamp of cliches. Norton makes you empathize with Rays angst over deciding whether or not to rat on his fellow officers although the movie takes even that decision from him forcing his hand in a way that actually diminishes the characters heroism. Farrell who is better at playing villains than heroes is convincing as the run-amok Jimmy even if the film pushes his character to ridiculous extremes such as holding a hot iron over a babys face in order to get an informant to talk. Voight even pulls off that old actors bane of a convincing drunk scene expressing his admiration for his sons over Christmas dinner during one of the films peaceful interludes. The peace doesnt last of course. Pride and Glory is appropriately gritty and violent but OConnor isnt particularly gifted at staging action and fudges at least one critical scene forcing the audience to rely on what the characters are saying to figure out what just happened. The actors keep it tolerable but as a serious look at internal police strife Pride and Glory isnt anywhere near the leagues of Serpico or L.A. Confidential or even this springs Street Kings. Its strictly rookie-caliber. Cast Edward Norton Colin Farrell Noah Emmerich Jon Voight Jennifer Ehle John Ortiz. Director Gavin OConnor. Screenwriters Joe Carnahan Gavin OConnor.

In Pride and Glory Edward Nortons character is looking for the killer(s) of four police officers. Photo GLEN WILSON WARNER BROS. PICTURES | ASSOCIATED PRESS Pride and Glory 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Dear Very Important Personages at Warner Bros. and New Line Cinema Excuse me for being so bold but I have a largeish bone to pick with you. Theres quite a bit of meat there so the gnawing process might take awhile. I hope you have a few minutes to spare for the unsolicited observations of an especially cranky film buff. My complaint concerns movie trailers that say too much -- and movie goers who prefer to remain in the dark when they enter a darkened theater. Im one of them. I realize its unusual in a tell-all spoil-everything pop-cultural landscape but I and a few other Luddites would honestly rather not know every last detail of a film months before its released. Consider the trailer for your latest output Pride and Glory a gritty police drama thats got a few things going for it. I like the guy who directed it -- Gavin OConnor who made the road-tripping Tumbleweeds and that whooping U.S. hockey movie Miracle. I mostly like his co-writer -- Joe Carnahan whose past work runs from the cuttingly good (Narc) to the barbarically nasty (Smokin Aces). But I love the cast. Colin Farrell and Edward Norton as brothers-in-law and brothers-in-arms on the NYPD emit selfish rage and mystic calm respectively. The Hibernian Farrell does a halfway-decent New York accent; he also bristles with the same kind of thuggish dynamism that propelled Jimmy Cagney. If any of you Very Important types ever decides to bankroll a remake of White Heat hes your man. I enjoyed the warmth of Pride and Glorys domestic subplots. I admired Noah Emmerich as Nortons dispirited brother (the captain of Farrells precinct) and Jon Voight as their proud tipsy dad. Whats more I have a longstanding weakness for good cop/bad cop scenarios set against a scummy New York crime scene even if the Big Apple they evoke hasnt been that rotten since the 1970s. And I was in the mood to overlook the films most egregious cliches -- including a rash of Irish-cop stereotyping that climaxes with a bare-knuckle fistfight in a pub. (While a reel plays on the jukebox Cmon -- whose idea was that?) Granted the opening scenes are a shaky-cam chaos. Mawkishness and bleating illogic plague the endgame. But I might have forgiven even that had the remainder of the movie not been ruined in the trailer. Which Id seen. Repeatedly. Thinking ""Gee that looks like a super cool movie but I hope they didnt spill the whole thing."" Which they did. (Anyone whod rather not know it should skip the next two paragraphs.) What constitutes ""whole""? Well for starters I knew that Norton plays an honest policeman assigned to investigate the deaths of four cops. I knew that Farrell plays a dishonest policeman linked to the killings. I knew that at some point he threatens some poor lump with a steaming-hot iron; I did not know that the lump being threatened is approximately 3 months old a fact shrewdly left out of the trailer. I knew that Norton unearths evidence of dirty cops and that Voight urges Norton to suppress it. I knew from the first few seconds of a preview that Norton stares down investigators from Internal Affairs and says half-dead with fatigue ""This isnt gonna go how you want it to"" -- a significant moral crux that arrives almost an hour and 40 minutes into the movie. I knew that Norton confronts Farrell with the facts that Farrell goes all Cagney in reply and that the two square off like 19th-century pugilists. So listen up Very Important People. In some movies story doesnt matter (Warhol maybe). In crime thrillers they do. Is there no way for studios to market one without blowing the plot? Why not distribute a trailer that whets the appetite without sating it? Well? Think about that. Chew on it if you will. I look forward to your response.

New Yorks finest have opened a can of whup-ahem on their gridiron opponents on a wintry night. But for Jimmy Egan and Ray and Francis Tierney -- his brothers-in-law and in law enforcement -- celebrating is short-lived. Four police officers have been gunned down in what appears to be a 911 call gone ugly. All were men in the station house where Jimmy works and Francis is captain. One was Rays friend and former partner. Chief of Manhattan detectives Francis Tierney Sr. (Jon Voight) uses the killings as an opportunity to bring Ray back into the fold. Its one of those good ideas that portends Greek-tragedy consequences. A sketchy bust has scarred Francis youngest son played by Edward Norton leaving him with a crease across his cheek a busted marriage and a deep desire to stay far away from the grayer areas of the thin blue line. He works Missing Persons. Ray agrees to join the task force. Soon hes asking questions that will put him at odds with Jimmy (Colin Farrell) who along with other rogue officers has made too many pacts with too many devils. ""Pride and Glory"" is one of those titles at once vague and promising. It doesnt give away a lot yet hints that important ideals are at stake. What kind of pride? What sort of glory? Those could be themes of any cop-and-corruption tale. Well-paced well-acted ""Pride and Glory"" is much richer than routine. The movies underlying depth might be the result of the fact that director Gavin OConnor and brother Gregory who conceived the story together are sons of a New York City cop. Family matters here. Its importance is delivered in Francis Sr.s overstated oratory but also shown in the understated domestic details captured by Declan Quinns fine camerawork. Over a holiday dinner Francis Sr. makes paternal sense out of the fraternal order gathered around the table. ""He was the brains"" Francis boasts of Ray in one of those holiday speeches that careens toward emotionally loaded. About the time his overpraise gets uncomfortable he talks with admiration for his eldest. Frannie has always been a leader. Voight depicts Francis Sr. as man of a certain generation who swings from hard-headed honor to softer-hearted sentiment and back again aided by a Scotch or two. Throughout Francis rambling tribute Jimmy stares. The brains. The leader. Where exactly does that leave Jimmy who married into the Tierney clan? The expression isnt one of contempt exactly. Farrell doesnt overstate Jimmys psychic tussle. But his thug life exists in another universe one he thinks he can control. Its sure to engulf him. When a visitor from that other planet (Rick Gonzalez) shows up all cocky at his home one morning his rage is understandable. Jimmys increasingly desperate actions are examples of self-justified cruelty. The only women and children who matter are his own. The movie is greatly abetted by Jennifer Ehles turn as Francis Jr.s wife. Abby is battling cancer and losing the fight. She wears a scarf on her shaved head. She takes an exhausting amount of pills. She sits next to her childrens bedside at night watching. She senses her husbands fear at her situation but also something else gnawing at him. Too often in cop-family tales the primary relationships are between cop and quarry cop and cop. Full of the requisite violence and brotherly angst ""Pride and Glory"" makes delicate impressive use of wives and mothers. With a couple of dynamic scenes between Abby and Franny ""Pride and Glory"" reminds us how seldom other lives -- and other ways of dying -- get their due. Leave it to the sons of one of New Yorks finest to articulate such a vital point. ""Pride and Glory"" R for strong violence pervasive language and brief drug content. Jennifer Ehle John Ortiz Frank Grillo Shea Whigham Lake Bell. 2 hours 10 minutes.

"In Pride and Glory its all in the precinct - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In Pride and Glory its all in the precinct Colin Farrell (left) and Edward Norton in Pride and Glory. (Glen wilson/new line cinema) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / October 24 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + The funeral finally arrives 45 minutes into ""Pride and Glory"" but the movies been preparing for it from the opening credits Everything in this good-cop/bad-cop action drama is shrouded in gray and attended by wailing. This isnt a feel-good genre granted but does it have to feel this bad?When ""Pride and Glory"" opens four cops are dead apparently shot in a Bronx drug raid gone wrong. Precinct commander Francis Tierney (Noah Emmerich) assigns his brother Ray (Edward Norton) to the investigative task force urged by their father (Jon Voight) a high NYPD muckety-muck who wants to bring the prodigal son back into the fold. Ray has physical and emotional scars from a mysterious earlier incident; in case you missed that metaphor he lives on a boat thats slowly sinking into New York Harbor.If Ray is a tarnished white knight and Franny is fairly upstanding their brother-in-law Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell) is the devil in a blue uniform. He leads a dirty crew specializing in mayhem and murder; the only questions are how long Ray will take to discover it and what Francis will do when he finds out.Director Gavin OConnor and co-screenwriter Joe Carnahan take a perfectly fine B-movie premise and slow it down to an A-movie pace; in the process they remove the juice that keeps a story like this honest. Norton does his usual fine reined-in work but you sense Rays calling for back-up in more ways than one. Emmerich is handcuffed by his characters indecisiveness and Voight aims for the back row - someone must have told him this was Shakespeare.Its not; Shakespeare wouldnt have been this afraid to go slumming. The few times ""Pride and Glory"" jumps to life are when it drops the mournful pose and lets rip with the villainy. Frank Grillo and Shea Whigham make a frightening pair of Mutt-and-Jeff bad cops and theres a lulu of a scene involving Farrell terrorizing a drug dealers family during their holiday dinner. In particular what transpires with Jimmy and the dealers infant child is almost up there with Richard Widmark pushing the old lady downstairs in ""Kiss of Death."" (Dont worry I said ""almost."")Elsewhere ""Pride and Glory"" combines cop-movie cliches and self-consciousness - a deadly duo. The heavyhandedness extends to the weight of sin everyone here seems to be living under and the weeping that most of the characters get to indulge in one scene or another. Just in case you thought the mood was too light Frannys wife (Jennifer Ehle) is dying of cancer.Scorsese can pull this stuff off in part because he loves the stink and the snap at the heart of a crime movie (and in part because hes an artist). James Gray (""The Yards"" ""We Own the Night"") walks these mean streets with a similar ponderousness but hes an obsessive who never relaxes his grip. In ""Pride"" OConnor maintains his tone of high solemnity until youre just starting to cave in then trashes the flow with an absurd near-comic climactic fistfight. If a director cant trust his own posturing why should we?

At the very least maybe its time to confiscate director Gavin OConnor and writer Joe Carnahans copies of Serpico and Prince of the City. Gritty jumpy and rife with cliches Pride and Glory emits a distinct retro vibe even as its cameras swoop and jerk around the grimier precincts of modern-day New York telling a tale of good cops and crooked cops fathers sons brothers and in-laws who wear the NYPD badge with honor - or with self-interest vengeance and suspiciously large bank accounts. Beginning on a muddy Coney Island football field and ending on the steps of a Manhattan courthouse Pride and Glory stars Colin Farrell and Edward Norton as two of New Yorks finest. Nortons Ray Tierney is a smart straight-arrow detective heading a task force to catch the killers of four ambushed police in a Washington Heights walkup. His dad Francis Tierney Sr. (Jon Voight) is chief of detectives. Rays brother Francis Jr. (Noah Emmerich) is the captain of the squad that just lost its men. And Farrell nostrils flaring and arms flailing in serious over-acting mode is Jimmy Egan fellow cop and member of the Tierney clan by marriage - his wife is Rays sister Megan (Lake Bell). Hes all tears and rage at the hospital looking on as one of his brethren hangs by a thread. But as Ray sets out to find the perpetrators OConnors camera cuts to Jimmy and his cohorts torching the suspected shooters getaway car. Uh-oh the killings were an inside job and the unthinkable has been thunk rogue cops drug ripoffs extortion and worse. Loyalty betrayal fraternity ya-da-ya-da. With its moody music cues (courtesy of Mark Isham) and dark grubby cityscapes its bar fights and police raids Pride and Glory definitely stirs up some drama. But the script doesnt serve the drama well The patter is tired and even Norton one of the best around acts as if hes hoisting his pants before delivering his lines - hes trying too hard. (And whats with Ray living on a boat in a city marina? Miami Vice this is not.) Things reach a fever pitch outside a corner bodega where another bad cop has flipped out and taken a hostage and the citizens in the neighborhood grab bats and bottles seething with bad feelings for the police that have abused their position - and abused the neighborhood. But what about the abused audience? And wheres Al Pacino when you need him?Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Has there never been a movie made with that name? Whatever the case its fitting because theres nothing new about the film including its basic problem a cast of talented actors cut off at the knees by stilted cliched writing. Edward Norton Colin Farrell Noah Emmerich and Jon Voight all have their moments a couple of them stunning. But the moments the actors and the movie are overwhelmed by ludicrous macho-cop posturing and silly dialogue. When a police official says ""Im gonna say what Im gonna say"" you know youre in by-the-numbers NYC cop-movie territory and that theres no escape even if it is Voight uttering the line. The film eventually gains some momentum but it takes way too long to get there. And having established its premise it abandons its forward movement for a climax that relies on coincidence and cliche (again). Either that or maybe all the worlds problems really can be solved by a fight in an Irish bar. It beats invading other countries but one questions its effectiveness. The blame lies with Gavin OConnor and Joe Carnahan who wrote the film (which OConnor directed). Theres nothing wrong with being influenced by films that came before but too often they simply lift familiar elements and string them together particularly at the beginning of the movie in which four officers are gunned down. This hits the Tierney family especially hard. Francis Sr. (Voight) is the chief of detectives. Francis Jr. (Emmerich) supervised the dead cops; Jimmy Egan (Farrell) was their sergeant. Whats more hes married to Francis Sr.s daughter. Francis Sr. leans on his other son Ray (Norton) to lead the investigation into the shooting; he reluctantly agrees. It doesnt take long to figure out that there was more to the tragedy than just a routine bust gone horribly wrong. And you neednt have seen a lot of movies like this to know that corruption can hit close to home. Hmm. Family of Irish cops in New York. What could possibly go wrong? The good cops are generally decent if touched by their own occasionally twisted sense of loyalty. But the bad cops are very bad willing to go to almost unthinkable lengths to get what they want and to protect their secrets. One scene in particular is almost impossible to watch without being physically repulsed. Francis Jr.s wife Abby (Jennifer Ehle) is dying of cancer and as required in this kind of movie (particularly this one) serves as a sort of moral compass. Shes good in a limited role; a scene in which she looks at her children as they sleep and bursts into tears says so much by saying nothing at all - a rare moment of subtlety in an otherwise paint-by-loud-numbers affair. The best parts of the film involve Norton working the case. Hes a great actor making what he can of a rote story. Farrell and Voight also are good and Emmerich is outstanding as a man whose entire life is suddenly slipping from his grasp. Ultimately though all are felled by familiarity. The acting makes more of Pride and Glory than is actually there. Best to take a shot of Irish whiskey and not think too much about it.

"Pride and Glory | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pride-and-glory ) Pride and Glory (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli The generic cop movie has become such a tedious bore that when something like The Departed comes along it injects energy into a genre that over time has lost momentum to a dried-up wellspring of creativity. Even as recently as the 80s when Dirty Harry was still patrolling his beat and the Miami Vice detectives were taking down bad guys every Friday night the cop story could provide the adrenaline-and-testosterone cocktail that has since been ceded to other action/thriller sub-genres. Cop movies have recently fallen into a formulaic rut with all the expected plot points lined up like dominos waiting to be knocked over. Pride and Glory from director Gavin OConnor tries at least to a degree to escape that vortex. It wants to be different; yet in the end the elements that separate this police corruption film from those with similar themes and subjects are those that derail the climax and send this freight train careening out of control. Once upon a time it was ""cops and robbers."" Now the cops sometimes are the robbers. Such is the case in Pride and Glory which explores the well-tilled territory that sometimes the most egregious examples of violence against police is perpetrated by other cops. Predictably such incidents are followed by cover-ups until the Righteous Incorruptible One performing the investigation gets close to the truth. The movie runs 125 minutes and for about 110 of those minutes its a workmanlike take on the genre - not groundbreaking to be sure but competent in its rendering of drama and tension. Then in almost spectacular fashion it implodes with what ranks as one of the worst final 15 minutes of any major motion picture (worse even than Lakeview Terrace). Pride and Glory traverses the road from enjoyable to ludicrous in record time. This stunning example of self-immolation left me literally shaking my head as I exited the theater. A half hour earlier I had been silently congratulating the film for avoiding the kind of silly violent pitfalls that seem necessary in this sort of film. Edward Norton is Ray and Noah Emmerich is Francis Jr. - two brothers who are both NYPD stalwarts. Their brother-in-law Jimmy (Colin Farrell) is also a cop and Ray and Francis father (Jon Voight) is an ex-police chief. Blue runs in their blood but that blood threatens to spill on the streets when four cops are killed and Rays investigation into the massacre leads him to believe that cops were involved. As it turns out the culprits werent just ""any"" cops but a group headed by Jimmy who has been using members of his squad to carry out murders for cash. Since its drug dealers paying for other drug dealers to die Jimmy doesnt see anything wrong with it but when one of his targets gets away the fallout threatens to expose the scheme and plunge public trust in the police to an all-time low. Its impossible to argue about the quality of the acting but one would expect no less from the likes of Norton and Farrell. Both are capable of crafting volcanic screen personas and thats what we get here. Voight who has been somewhat hit-and-miss in recent years (he has resorted to taking a few too many roles simply for the paycheck) is in fine form and there are solid supporting performances from Emmerich and Jennifer Ehle (everyones favorite Elizabeth Bennett) as Francis cancer-stricken wife. There is some truth to the belief that top-notch acting can elevate an otherwise unremarkable motion picture and thats what happens here at least for most of the production. There are some problems however that not even a superlative roster of performances can obscure. For well over 90 minutes the writing is as solid as the acting. The narrative generates sufficient tension to make us forget how familiar many of the beats are and the intelligent way in which the investigation is handled makes us wonder why more police thrillers couldnt be like this. The disappointment engendered by the ending is hard to express. There are at least three major problems. Without being specific I can say that one has to do with an incident at a convenience store another relates to a fist-fight and a third employs a coincidence of staggering magnitude. The final 15 minutes are so awful that its difficult to believe that the bulk of the film is actually decent. Some movies can survive a bad climax well enough to receive a recommendation. Pride and Glory is not among their number.

"Movie review Pride and Glory -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Pride and Glory -- 3 out of 5 stars ""Pride and Glory"" follows a multi-generational NYC police family whose moral code is tested when one of two sons on the force investigates an incendiary case involving his older brother and brother-in-law. The case forces the family to choose between their loyalties to one another and their loyalties to the department. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Pride and Glory is a morality play in a minor key a movie about dirty cops and the way that dirt soils everybody with a badge and makes us all a little less safe. But throwing a cast this impressive at a story this predictable in a genre this tired is something of a waste. Edward Norton and Noah Emmerich play brothers who have followed the old man the Chief ( Jon Voight) into the NYPD. Colin Farrell is a cop who has married into their clan. But all is not well with the extended Tierney family. Ray (Norton) has never gotten over a shooting that left him with scars and not just the one we see along his cheek. Hes hiding out in Missing Persons still sending gifts to his soon-to-be-ex wife. Francis (Emmerich of Little Children) has advanced through the ranks but has a wife (Jennifer Ehle radiant) dying of cancer. And Jimmy Egan (Farrell) is up to his eyeballs in something that smells.A bloody shootout between drug dealers and cops has left four officers dead. ""You keep the rage. Cut the rest of it loose"" Jimmy advises. The urgency that Jimmy and Francis feel about finding the surviving shooter is compounded by the knowledge that they dont want this guy to talk. Dad wants Ray on the ""task force"" out to track down this killer.""Go at it with all the gifts God gaveya"" he charges his son even as hes telling the other son ""We stay out in front of the task force on this.""Their whole corner of the Force is circling the wagons and Ray a once promising detective is the last one to figure that out. Every lead he finds is shared with the bad guys. He spends the Christmas week of this investigation permanently one step behind the folks who want this wrapped up with a corpse. Dad is always there with a lecture about loyalty the unwritten code of the men and women in blue. And Ray wonders as do we how deep into the ranks this stain spreads.Farrell plays Jimmy in a beady-eyed fury Norton makes Ray smart but gun-shy and Voight chews the scenery in a memorable drunk scene or two. Ehle her head shaved gives the tale a pathos and Shea Whigham stands out as a cop gone wrong. You couldnt get a terrible movie out of this cast at gunpoint even one co-written by Joe ""Smoking Aces"" Carnahan. Was it his idea to have Ray call for backup ""forthwith?"" Routine as the plot is the film has a gritty look and feel and still works well enough on the strength of characters and streetwise jargon-filled scenes that good actors give a real dramatic heft.Pride and Glory goes off the tracks a couple of times before we hear the title line uttered by a cop remembering why he picked up the badge and the finale hurls the film completely in the ditch. What were left with isnt an embarrassment but isnt anything for this proud cast to glory in either.

But Pride and Glory is an old-style exception a tightly acted and emotionally bruising corrupt-cop family drama that feels like the kind of serious slow-burn NYPD movie nobody -- not even Lumet -- makes anymore. Edward Norton is in top form as Ray a burned-out detective whose investigation into the deaths of four cops leads him to suspect his brother-in-law Officer Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell also terrific). The climactic bar brawl and street beating unfortunately feel too stock but otherwise co-writer/ director Gavin OConnor puts a new shine on familiar material -- something he also did in his previous film the 2004 Kurt Russell feel-good hockey drama Miracle. If OConnor is out to build a career revitalizing old movie genres hes two-for-two so far.

The chief of Manhattan detectives who happens to be Rays pop Francis Tierney Sr. (Jon Voight) cajoles and guilts his boy into coming out of semi-retirement to solve the case of four cops gunned down in a drug dealers Washington Heights apartment--cops who happened to have been under the command of Rays brother Francis Jr. (Noah Emmerich) and Rays brother-in-law Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell). Only so happens that the four cops who were shot to pieces that cold December night--as protocol dictates the film takes place during Christmas and New Years-- were dirty badges collecting drug money for Jimmy who was working both sides of the alley to make ends meet. Which is not a spoiler; far from it. Fact is by the end of the films first 10 minutes the audience knows precisely whos who and whos up to what and how this is gonna end. Which leaves 120 more minutes to fill--or three weeks whichever comes first. How ironic that a movie filled with police officers should end up feeling like a hostage situation.

Edward Norton and Colin Farrell star as the brothers-in-law at the heart of the case with Noah Emmerich in an understated one-to-watch performance as their conflicted cohort. -- Sara Cardace Related Stories Featured In What You Need to Know About Pride and Glory Star Noah Emmerich (10/27/08) Advertisement Top 10 Movies Star Trek Beyond The Secret Life of Pets Ghostbusters Lights Out Ice Age Collision Course Finding Dory The Legend of Tarzan Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates Hillarys America The Secret History of the Democratic Party The Infiltrator Advertising On The Set of Jill Soloways I Love Dick True Detective Season 3 May Happen After All Jon Stewartas New HBO Show Will Be Animated and Onion-Like Divorce Insecure and Westworld Get Fall Premiere Dates on HBO TV Review BoJack Horseman Gucci Mane Is Better Than Hes Been in Years Absolutely Fabulous The Movie Is Only Semi-Fab Copyright (c) 2016 New York Media LLC.
