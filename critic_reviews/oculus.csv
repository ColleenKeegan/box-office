Photo John Estes Relativity Media Oculus review Intricate chiller fizzles in end 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Oculus Horror. Starring Karen Gillan Brenton Thwaites Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane. Directed by Mike Flanagan. (R. 105 minutes.) ""Oculus"" is about one adjustment away from being a superior thriller. The screenwriters spend most of the movie painting themselves into a corner and the audience waits to see how they will get out ... except they never do. Just one idea - one medium-size idea - might have saved it and turned this movie from a well-made curiosity to something everyone should see. ""Oculus"" has everything else a good premise smooth and skillful direction and a leading lady in Karen Gillan who has a vivid face and impressive verbal dexterity. Listening to her tearing through the text talking fast and with authority you know instantly that this is someone who was conservatory trained. And despite the American accent it comes as no surprise to find out later that she was born in Scotland and schooled in London. A brother and sister do battle against the evil mirror that destroyed their family. Thats right a mirror. Its floor-length with an ornate black frame and has been around since the 16th century wrecking peoples lives. In 2002 it caused a wife to lose her mind and a husband to commit murder. Now years later the grown children of the hapless couple move the mirror into the house where the tragedy took place and surrounded by video cameras set out to prove that the mirror was at fault not their parents. Thats both the gimmick and the story of ""Oculus"" and its quite enough. As the film goes on we come to understand the mirrors powers its range of influence its ability to regulate temperature and to cause hallucinations. All the details serve to create a texture of reality around this mirror which is some kind of portal into absolute darkness. Director Mike Flanagan who co-wrote the screenplay intercuts the events of the two fatal nights the one in the present and the one experienced by the protagonists as children back in 2002. In the beginning these flashes to the past are traditional flashbacks. We know when they begin; they last for a couple of minutes and then we know where they end. But gradually the flashbacks accelerate in frequency to the point where 2014 and 2002 are switching back and forth from one shot to the next. ""Oculus"" becomes filmically sophisticated juggling real past events real current events and past and present hallucinations all seamlessly but better than seamlessly - with an emotional logic that adheres to no set pattern just an unerring intuition. Whose intuition should be praised? The screenwriters? The director? The editor? Or everybody? Its hard to tell whether all this intercutting was part of the original conception or something arrived at after the event - Id guess the former. Either way its this movies claim to fame and ""Oculus"" would be worth its fame more fame than its going to get if it all didnt come crashing down with a cliched ending.

Praised on the festival circuit its got what it takes to succeed outside of that rarefied atmosphere there are scares but also characters; the camerawork is elegant but so is the plotting; the best moments in it are about subtlety not scarlet-hued fake blood hurling out of the screen at you; it builds real suspense as part of a coherent story while still dishing out plenty of surprises seemingly at random to jolt you with jumps along the way. Its clean lean and smart. 10 years ago the Russell family was torn apart by tragedy; after a move to a new house work-from-home programmer dad Alan (Rory Cochrane) went mad killing his wife Marie (Katie Sackhoff) and after threatening his children Kaylie (Annalise Baso) and Tim (Garrett Ryan) he himself was killed in self-defense by his own son. We learn this as Tim now grown (and played by Brendon Thwaites) is leaving the home-slash-prison hes lived in for years. The fully-grown Kaylie (Karen Gillan) greets him on his release in part because shes glad to see him but in part because of the promise they made years ago to remember what really happened to their mom and dad ... and to do something about it. Considering that much of the time in any horror film is spent convincing the protagonists that theyre in a horror film its always nice when a film trusts itself -- and us -- to get to the supernatural stuff early and swiftly and when its well done. As part of their antique-heavy re-model the Russells accidentally picked up a mirror known as the Lasser Glass which is renowned for its construction -- the massive frame is carved from one piece of black Bavarian cedar -- and for a string of horrible deaths and murders in its wake. Kaylie hasnt just researched the Lasser Glass; shes made sure she can not only find it as an auctions-house expert but keep it for a few days so she can test her theory that something about or something inside the mirror drives its owners to death. For Tim his whole life has been coming to terms that his father went mad and had to be shot; for Kaylie her whole life has been about proving her father wasnt a killer and with Tims help she can finally break the curse of the mirror literally and figuratively. The most nicely-tuned thing in ""Oculus"" is how it manages a trick of parallel construction on par with the Stephen King novel ""It"" as the ghostbusting attempts of the grown Kaylie and Tim intercut with the story of how young Kaylie and Tim had their loving home turned into a slaughterhouse. Sure you know that young Kaylie and Tim have to survive to become grown Kaylie and Tim but its to the films credit that as the movie moves between timelines you still find yourself concerned for what might happen to them as the Lasser Glass drives Mom and Dad insane. In the present day Kaylie very much has a plan to deal with the Lasser Glass ... or rather about 80% of a plan which may not be at all what the circumstance will require. Co-written by Flanagan and Jeff Howard ""Oculus"" is improved immensely by Gillan and Thwaites even if a lot of their conversations sound like they were lifted from a beginners debate class working the topic of ""Skepticism vs. Belief"" at half-speed for practice; also some of the supporting characters are at best under-written or at least not written well enough that I cared when they got stabbed. Both Cochrane and Sackhoff (and for that matter Baso and Ryan as their children) are excellent as well; the plot may put their characters on swift sloped rails but they build their parts into people before tearing those people down with madness. The camerawork in ""Oculus"" is also as well-honed as it is welcome; long gliding takes slide like a knife-point being dragged down your skin before a sudden sharp stab as it changes direction and finds the moment of maximum tension. And the fact that the Lasser Glass can only confound the minds of its victims is spelled out cleanly used cleverly and is part of the puzzling pleasure of the finale. Still the scariest moment in ""Oculus"" for me came as Kaylie picks up and bites into what she thought was an apple; its a completely unseen moment but the sound and the shot and the timing made me actually say ""Oh no ... no please ..."" in a theater full of people wrung out of my frightened brain by the filmmakers grip on the audience. ""Oculus"" isnt perfect but it has effort to match its elegance smarts to match its scares and people to care about facing fear with all they have. In an age of ho-hum rinse-and-repeat horror ""franchises"" and style-free scare-free mock-doc cheapie horror films its worth looking into.

But it doesnt have a lot of scares and theres a void where its nerve center ought to be. Overexplaining the source of evil (i.e. that old Indian graveyard) has its own pitfalls but even the most irrational demon needs a bit of context -- psychological cultural historical. The bad mirror at the heart of Oculus doesnt have any particular resonance. It just sits there as mirrors will do. The movie unfolds in two time different periods. In the present twentysomething Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) picks up her brother Tim (Brendan Thwaites) at a mental hospital where hes been shut away for more than a decade and announces she plans to avenge their parents death. In the past we learn how the parents met their fates and young Tim became the scapegoat. The director Mike Flanagan shifts back and forth between story lines building to twin bloodbaths in the same house the same room. Scene by scene the film is rich in emotion but Flanagan takes his time going nowhere we cant guess. There are fine set pieces. Kaylies scheme involves both destroying the life-size mirror and documenting its supernatural power. This entails setting up multiple cameras along with heat sensors and in a novel touch potted plants. (The mirror is said to make them droop.) Its always fun in horror movies when earnest people employ high-tech scientific instruments to scrutinize old-fashioned ghouls and the sense of anticipation as Flanagan cuts among the video vantages and nothing happens makes you nervous about whats coming. But Gillan -- a leggy Scottish redhead who played Matt Smiths companion on a couple of seasons of Dr. WhoA -- has little to do but look pissed-off and determined while Thwaitess Tim tells her over and over shes delusional. And given how easy it is nowadays to manipulate video images to make you think youre seeing something that isnt there the mirrors powers dont seem especially mind-blowing. iMovie can do it even better. The scenes in the past have more Evil Dead-esque oomph. The kids mom is another familiar genre face -- Katee Sackhoff magnetic as Starbuck on Battlestar GalacticaA -- and her transformation under the mirrors gaze from a loving parent to a demon that wants to cut her own offspring to shreds is both terrifying and heartbreaking. Sackhoff is enough of an actress to give you hints of the horrified mother under the twisty mottled mask and Annalise Basso as young Kaylie plays her emotional schism (want to run from Mommy want to hug Mommy) very affectingly. The gory climax hits a tragic note; its Grand Guignol grand opera. Whats missing? A sense of the ineffable. Working with much lamer material James Wan in The Conjuring created an overpowering sense of visual menace. Over the years Wan has learned just where to put the camera to suggest whats missing in the frame and what our minds fill in is infinitely more frightening than any whey-faced goon. One reason Oculus feels so talky and monotonous in spite of its tricky syntax is that the space itself isnt charged with malignancy. And the monster doesnt compensate -- its dumb blockish inert. The mirror doesnt have two faces. It barely has one.

Jones The Bleader Film April 16 2014 Movies | Movie Review Tweet Pin It Reprints Share In Oculus home is where the haunting is A brother and sister reunite at the site of their parents gruesome deaths in Mike Flanagans haunted-house movie. By Ben Sachs 1bsachs Oculus  Directed by Mike Flanagan Regardless of any supernatural elements the richest horror films tend to be ones that tap into more earth-bound fears. Jacques Tourneurs Cat People (1942) and I Walked With a Zombie (1943) hinge on their heroines dread of being vulnerable to sexual predators. George Romeros ""Living Dead"" cycle plays on the fear that such established social institutions as the nuclear family the military and capitalism will prove meaningless in the event of catastrophe. Oculus a cleverer-than-average haunted-house movie currently in theaters speaks to a couple of widespread anxieties--one topical the other sadly timeless. Director Mike Flanagan integrates these concerns into the horror-movie mechanics with some grace making for a more involving entertainment than Insidious or The Conjuring recent haunted-house films by his contemporary (and Saw alumnus) James Wan. A brother and sister in their early 20s reunite at their suburban childhood home where their parents died gruesomely about ten years earlier. The sister is convinced that the parents were turned into homicidal maniacs by a haunted old mirror in the fathers study; through research shes discovered that everyone who owned it over the past three centuries has died in some macabre way. She sets out to prove her theory by locking herself and her brother in the house and setting up a network of cameras to document the mirrors supernatural powers. The brother who spent his childhood in juvenile detention for killing the father in self-defense at first finds her theory incredible insisting that shes constructed a supernatural fantasy to explain how their parents became psychotic--in a nice reversal of the horror-movie cliche the sister is more intrepid and the brother more ruminative. Of course he changes his tune when spooky stuff begins to happen. At times Oculus suggests an allegory for how children compensate for being powerless to stop incidents of domestic violence. It also seems to critique a common information-age presumption that we can become neutral observers of our lives if we document every aspect of them. One way the mirror intimidates the siblings is by making them hallucinate horrific events and some of the more effective scares occur when they find themselves unable to locate records of things that they (and we) believe to have happened. These moments display a smart self-reflexive approach to film editing as Flanagan cuts away from some grisly image to reveal it was only a hallucination. The sinuous narrative structure is skillful as well snaking between the present and events leading up to the original traumatic episode. As in Jacques Rivettes self-reflexive masterpiece Celine and Julie Go Boating the two time frames begin to overlap in the movies second half with the adult siblings appearing to interact with people from their childhood. This development might reflect how victims of childhood trauma are condemned to relive their worst experiences over and over though the movies subtext feels increasingly vague the more intricate its plot becomes. Still compared with Wans recent efforts--so devoid of subtext that they cave in on themselves like wet sand castles--Oculus feels like The Turn of the Screw.

"Small(er) Movie Roundup Because There Is Life Beyond Marvel and Mad Men and Westeros << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup Because There Is Life Beyond Marvel and Mad Men and Westeros Movies April 15 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print In addition to the films reviewed below two others are in theaters now Nicolas Cage is acting up a storm in Joe and Kristen Wiig is doing a different sort of acting in Hateship Loveship. I saw and wrote about both films last year in Toronto and again recently hoping my feelings about them would change. Sadly they havent. Oculus directed by Mike Flanagan I saw this Saturday night at a mostly full screening in suburban Wilmington Delaware seated behind two teenage girls who talked the entire film. Their honest confusion overrode the temptation to shush them. They werent just talking to each other. They were talking each other through this movie. After 30 minutes I realized I was listening to them in case Id missed something like why the instant Tim (Brenton Thwaites) is released from a mental hospital for shooting his father (Rory Cochrane) his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan) wants immediately to exonerate him by making him relive the traumas hed been trying to forget for some kind of video project. And if the siblings are convinced their fathers deadly mirror was the root of all past evil why dont the filmmakers manage to do anything frightening with it? And was there no way to make the leaps between now and a decade ago coherent at all? As far as competence goes Oculus doesnt have so little as to be accidentally entertaining or enough to come close to working. Theres charm in the lack of obvious effects Its a lot of not-very-good actors standing around talking and staring into a mirror that might go for 100 on Antiques Roadshow. But the ending is a cruel joke thats harder on the audience than it is on the victim. A couple of people hissed. At some point one of the girls sympathized that the filmmakers didnt have enough money to spend but you can also imagine more money producing a somehow worse movie. Besides Good storytelling is free. Hank and Asha directed by James E. Duff Indian student Asha (Mahira Kakkar) is studying filmmaking in the Czech Republic and sees a movie Hank (Andrew Pastides) -- a white New Yorker -- made. She sends him videos telling him how enchanting she found it. She wants to know what hes working on now. He responds with handsome-looking videos in which he goes on about himself. (Hes a production assistant on a reality show.) And back and forth the videos go. She rides a swing and hops around a park and walks around her apartment. He sends her a drinking-and-eating montage. It goes like this for about 71 minutes. The conceit is old-fashioned hey people falling in love long-distance But the modern renovation (Duff wrote the movie with Julia Morrison) confers a mild obnoxiousness. Liking these two isnt absolutely required but you have to at least find Ashas tagging a wall and Hanks doing a Bollywood Risky Business dance cute. Its not not cute. Theyre both poised -- sos the camera framing; its usually perfect -- but all that poise starts to make you crazy. Could she possibly have sent that one video without embracing that pillow or taking a sip from a mug? Could he not be in bed with that guitar? Is the strumming coffeehouse soundtrack necessary? Yes. How else would we know to say ""Awww""? Cuban Fury directed by James Griffiths The joke in this office comedy is that its funny to watch tubby Nick Frost enter a salsa contest and dance-fight the tall thickly built comedian Chris ODowd in a parking lot. Its not a bad gimmick but the movie turns tediously sentimental fast. Its set at a London industrial machinery company thats just hired an American executive (Rashida Jones) whom Frosts engineer Bruce and Dowds adman find themselves fighting over. Bruce discovers shes taking salsa classes and decides to shed some childhood dance trauma and get back in shape. You know where this is headed and not because Ive pretty much told you. Ian McShane Olivia Colman and Kayvan Novak have some good stuff to do as respectively Bruces dance guru his saucy sister and a mincing culturally confused classmate. Frost gets to spend the movie struggling with his appeal. Hes best known for being Simon Peggs sidekick. But hes got his own star quality. Until the dance-fight this movie more or less treats him as though hes Ernest Borgnine in Marty. If you dont believe Jones finds him attractive its not that he isnt (he is) -- its that the movie never lets them establish a comedic rapport. Its another movie in which all the physical chemistry exists among the men and the woman is here to maintain an illusion of sexual clarity. How long can this continue to be the case for Jones? When at last will the fury be hers? Only Lovers Left Alive directed by Jim Jarmusch It seems apt that Jim Jarmusch has gotten around to vampires. He has the public persona of the undead. For his 11th feature Americas most self-consciously rock-and-roll director channels that persona into a famous bloodsucker musician (Tom Hiddleston) wallowing in the Detroit of right now with his wife (Tilda Swinton). Theyre named Adam and Eve and theyre jaded to the max so much so that hes turned suicidal. In a sense the movie is above reproach. Jarmusch has loaded it with the kind of satirical and historical amusement that anticipates almost any eye-rolling youre tempted to do. And still ... there went my eyes. The movie is steeped in a world-weariness that flatters a certain kind of know-it-all. Swinton and Hiddleston looking like twins take disaffection to the moon. Not since Weekend at Bernies have two actors done more to promote the cause of corpses. The idea of a Jarmusch vampire movie feels like a joke hes only halfway in on. Hes arguing that the world has changed and cool is no longer what it used to be. That lament goes beyond nostalgia into a kind of aged bitterness. Hes 61 now and the search in this movie is for a return to elusive creative innocence for cultural truth. But his wryness is tired. It has nowhere new to go. Hes making a reclamation argument in a movie genre beloved of girls who have no idea who Screamin Jay Hawkins is. By the time Adam and Eve are forced to resume human bloodsucking in Tangier the movies become a macabre culture romance. They discover a wellspring of artistic and sexual authenticity that Adam at least cant find back in the States. Needless to say they bare their fangs and take a bite. Jarmusch is no longer doing satire at that point. Hes inadvertently veered into an altogether different kind of vampirism. Nymphomaniac directed by Lars von Trier Lars von Trier announced he was doing this movie during his notorious 2011 Melancholia press conference. He said he wanted to make porno and the journalists in the press room laughed not because a Lars von Trier porno is inherently funny (frankly at the time it seemed overdue) but because he was so flippant in his explanation. He claimed Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg had egged him on ""I said But then lets make a lot of talking in between. There should be a lot of dialogue. And they said We dont give a shit about dialogue. We just want to have a lot of very very unpleasant sex. And thats what Im working on. And its going to be about three or four hours long."" Nymphomaniac splits the difference -- it runs more than four hours has been chopped into two parts and features a lot of unpleasant sex and a lot of talking. Essentially its a case study with Gainsbourg as a woman named Joe whos found by a lonely bookworm (Stellan Skarsgard) badly beaten in an alleyway. He takes her home cleans her up and initiates an earnest conversation about the history of her sexuality that begins in girlhood and ends in that alley. She unpacks her erotic baggage and he interjects with explanatory anecdotes and incredulous rebuttals. His knowledge is arbitrarily vast psychology religion knots. This is an absurd enterprise but you get used to the absurdity (digressions obvious music cues endless explanatory academia bits of willful racism the fact that after the halfway point of Vol. II a door opens and its Willem Dafoe). Shia LaBeouf shows up occasionally wearing nothing more than an erection Stacy Martin (the model who plays a young Joe) and an English accent. There are parts of Udo Kier Jamie Bell Christian Slater and movingly unhinged Uma Thurman. Nymphomaniac is convincing as a work of philosophical seriousness. It gets to you. Von Trier and Gainsbourg are committed to this project and by the time its over theyve created a bizarre empathy for Joe and by extension female movie sexuality. It goes handsomely with Scarlett Johansson in Jonathan Glazers Under the Skin which is also currently playing. Von Trier began his career with an uncertainty about women. He made sensationalist melodramas that entailed a lot of unexamined suffering. But his last two films -- Antichrist and Melancholia both with the peerless fearless Gainsbourg -- constitute a staggering change in artistic and personal priorities. He isnt exploring or exploiting feminists. Hes become one.

Add to ... Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Apr. 11 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Apr. 10 2014 546PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Mike Flanagan Written by Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard Starring Karen Gillan and Brenton Thwaites Year 2014 Country USA Language English How do you get revenge on an inanimate object? Thats the quandary facing the characters in Oculus a deeply silly and mildly effective horror movie about two young-adult siblings coping with the mysterious deaths of their parents. After a decade in therapy Tim Russell (Brenton Thwaites) has finally reached a tenuous peace with his nightmarish memories but no sooner has he been deinstitutionalized than big sis Kaylie (Karen Gillan) tries to convince him that the real culprit was in fact the spooky 300-year-old wall mirror acquired by their father shortly before his demise and that they have to return to their childhood home and destroy the mirror before it kills again. The Globe and Mail Video Video Read this Now This book is a retelling of the Snow White fairy tale with a twist Whats novel about Oculus is its structure which cuts back and forth between Tim and Kaylie in 2012 and their experiences 10 years earlier. Because both timelines take place in the same household space director Mike Flanagan is able to create a number of eerie visual parallels - mirror images say - between past and present (Flanagan also edited the film himself superbly).Theres something richly suggestive in the premise of two troubled people returning to the proverbial primal scene to figure out how and why their lives got so screwed up and the scenes depicting the gradual unravelling of the Russells household are unsettling. Similarly chilling is the implication that the Russells pater bought the mirror as a symbol of his clans upward mobility. Viewed through this lens its possible to see Oculus as a kind of consumer critique and the Russell familys Amityville Horror experience as a punishment for buying into a very old-fashioned American Dream.If that seems like an awful lot of subtext for a movie featuring a lethal piece of furniture know that Oculus doesnt skimp on surface pleasures - the sorts of slow-burn suspense sequences and sudden shocks that box-office successes like Insidious and The Conjuring have brought back into vogue. Flanagan sometimes succeeds in matching and even besting these bigger-budget competitors engineering his share of scares - mostly involving creepy things glimpsed fleetingly in the mirror.But this peekaboo-terror strategy gets repetitive and as speeds toward its elaborately cross-cut conclusion less frightening. Flanagan is a gifted filmmaker but clear-eyed viewers will perceive that the film only reflects the visions of the skillful thrillers that came before it.

"Oculus | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; oculus ) Oculus (United States 2013) April 11 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli For a horror movie Oculus is surprisingly lean on the scares. Its more interested in playing tricks with perception and bending reality. Ambitious material for director/editor Mike Flanagan (expanding from his award-winning short) and if he doesnt fully achieve his goals he can at least be lauded for trying something different. Oculus isnt cut from the generic whole cloth of seemingly every other horror film. It tries to be distinctive not only in the way the narrative unfolds but in retaining its convictions to the very end. The biggest hurdle faced by Oculus relates to the set-up and thats the area in which it strains credulity to the breaking point. The central conceit establishes that an ancient mirror is a gateway of evil. The specifics arent divulged but the mirror can warp reality and possibly provide a conduit by which demons or evil spirits can enter our world. The films leading lady Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) is aware of the mirrors pernicious nature. Her intention is to destroy it. But in the name of science she intends to make video recordings of it and run tests thereby allowing it the opportunity to twist her perceptions. For someone with such a single-minded goal and a clear-headed approach to it Kaylie makes a series of boneheaded decisions. She is joined in her endeavor by her brother Tim (Brenton Thwaites) who is newly released from a mental asylum. Together they plan to exorcise the evil but only after assembling an airtight case establishing its responsibility for a series of past murders. Oculus interweaves Kaylie and Tims present with flashbacks of what happened to them a dozen years ago when their family moved into the house and took possession of the mirror. In less than two weeks a happy family is torn apart with Kaylies mother Marie (Katee Sackhoff) and father Alan (Rory Cochrane) falling prey to the mirror. For a while Flanagan takes his story down a fascinating path. What if the mirror is just a mirror and Kaylie has devised an elaborate supernatural mythos to explain acts of random mundane cruelty? Tim provides the voice of reason offering counter-arguments to every one of Kaylies points. Flanagan eventually abandons this and concedes that the mirror is a source of evil but it leaves one wondering whether the road not taken might have led in a more interesting direction. As the night wears on past collides with present. This part of the film is effectively presented. Were never sure whats real what events are memories and how to distinguish illusion from truth. The audience becomes complicit; were as uncertain as the characters. Its a bold way to allow the story to unfold but it leeches away terror in favor of intellectual uncertainty. Oculus becomes more of a puzzle than a haunted house story. There are some genuine shocks but not many ""boo"" moments. The movies most unsettling scene occurs when Kaylie takes a bite of an apple. The cast lacks star power demanding that Oculus succeed or fail based on intrinsic elements rather than the appeal of a headlining A-lister. Sci-fi fans will recognize a couple of familiar faces. For several years Karen Gillan played Amy Pond faithful sidekick to Matt Smiths incarnation of Doctor Who. Katee Sackhoff was Starbuck in Ron Moores reimaging of Battlestar Galactica. Breton Thwaites has a nice TV-centric resume and Rory Cochrane has been in the business for a couple of decades toiling away on TV and in mostly indie productions. The performances are all solid although I was most taken by Gillans no-nonsense approach to Kaylie. She doesnt seem like a typical horror movie heroine although the stupidity of some of her actions defies logic. With its overreliance on first-person narratives and by-the-numbers plotting the horror genre has become stale and predictable. Oculus isnt a perfect antidote to all of this but its sufficiently different to hold ones attention and what it lacks in the way of a fear factor it makes up for through suspense.

But then maybe you saw ""Absentia"" or already have plans to see his upcoming ""Somnia."" For now though we have ""Oculus."" This time its the old story beloved of British horror films of the haunted mirror. You know the one that used to belong to some wastrel duke (who then killed himself) and has since been bought by some poor sap who keeps staring into it. And staring. And then looking down at the gun in his hand. The recycling itself isnt a problem; scary movies are often about grisly resurrections. Also cozy familiarity. We want new scares true. But if you want to start us off with say a big new house a dog that barks at things we cant see and things that go bump in the night thats fine. Its where you go from there that matters. ""Oculus"" however goes in too many directions. The movie begins with a violent flashback then skips ahead to Junior being let out of the asylum. Lucky for him he has a big sister waiting for him eager to continue his therapy by bringing him back to their childhood home -- while giving us the backstory in fits and starts. Seems that a decade ago the family decorated their new suburban palace with one of those cursed mirrors; soon it took Dad and Mom and helped send Kaylie into the foster system and Tim into a doctors care. But now Kaylie is going to do two things Prove scientifically that the looking-glass really is evil and then destroy it forever. This is not a particularly strong setup -- no one in the audience has any doubts that the mirror is possessed -- and its not helped by its actors. Karen Gillan is particularly snappish and overcaffeinated as Kaylie -- she whips her hair around like a cat-o-nine-tails -- and Brenton Thwaites isnt much more than a skittish whiner as Tim. And then the story confuses things further by not only cutting constantly back to the familys original trauma but by having the adult characters also hallucinate seeing themselves as kids which eventually turns everything into a mashup of flashbacks and visions. Its actually a two-way street -- their younger versions seem to be aware of them too -- which actually hints at a far more fascinating albeit depressing ghost story What if it was about innocent kids being haunted by their own sad incredibly screwed-up adult selves? But instead though we get a lot of far more typical angry ghosts all with broken teeth and ball-bearing eyes and victims whom no matter how bad things get never think of calling the police. Flanagan works well with the younger actors -- Annalise Basso as young Kaylie is a fierce little warrior - and there are a few shocks of the usual jump-out-and-shout-boo variety. But even those are so predictably paced that you can almost count the beats until they arrive. One someone thinks they hear a noise. Two Three. Four -- ah its nothing relax. Five. And then Six -- Boo None of this is quite as scary or as original as Flanagan seems to think it is (he actually first made this film as a short and once had many more episodes planned tracing the mirrors history). Then again nor is it quite as tiresome as another zombie/teen dystopia/vampire flick. Its just a little vague a little familiar a little fake. You know. Like a reflection in an old mirror. Ratings note The film contains violence and strong language. Oculus (R) Relativity (108 min.) (R) Relativity (105 min.) Directed by Mike Flanagan. With Katie Sackhoff Karen Gillan.

Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan in ""Oculus."" (John Estes / Relativity Media) Robert Abele Two psychologically damaged siblings doing battle with a mysterious home furnishing makes for nervy moviegoing in the housebound chiller ""Oculus.""The object in question is the Lasser Glass an ornate antique black cedar mirror of historically malevolent intentions or so believes Kaylie (Karen Gillan) whose parents met a bloody psychotic end a decade ago. Her younger more emotionally fragile brother Tim (Brenton Thwaites) fresh from a mental facility is less sure of sis theory and more intent on moving on from the tragedy. But he still participates in Kaylies elaborate all-night exorcist-meets-ghostbuster plan to outsmart and destroy the mirror.HORROR CINEMA Genre favorites What ensues is a claustrophobic mind-freak a la Roman Polanskis 1965 ""Repulsion"" that -- thanks to co-writer and director Mike Flanagans ironclad grip on the material -- smartly grounds the showdown in the roots of childhood trauma and the adult siblings warring views on how to deal with it.The second half becomes a perception-distorting carnival ride in which Kaylie and Tim fight off mirror-induced realities while reliving the truth behind their parents breakdown depicted in deftly woven flashbacks that boast a pair of deliciously downward-spiraling performances by Rory Cochrane and Katee Sackhoff (whose expressive eyes were made for this genre).Less concerned with fake shocks and show-me violence than the grimly calibrated rotting of personalities ""Oculus"" is one of the more intelligently nasty horror films in recent memory.calendarlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Reviews Katee Sackhoff The politics of horror Review Kevin Costner inhabits his own league in Draft Day Review Amid Rio 2s cacophony the musical numbers shine Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad83deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-oculus-review-20140411,0,227671.story#axzz2yWo5fkXw",200,oculus12,oculus,latimes

JOHN ESTES JOHN ESTES OculusStarring  Karen Gillan Brenton Thwaites Katee Sackhoff Rory Cochrane Directed by Mike Flanagan Rated R for terror violence some disturbing images and brief language Running time 1 hour 45 minutes Playing In wide release (See theaters and movie times)The quick hitA smart labyrinthine horror film about a haunted mirror that should have followed the lead of its zesty heroine and dared to have more fun. Grade B- The clever somber horror movie ""Oculus"" pivots on an evil-infested antique mirror that uses hallucinatory tricks to drive men and women toward murder and suicide. Its far more intelligent and haunting than most chillers these days but near the end I kept wishing it would lighten up and be entertaining. In classic horror even the grisliest fun came from seeing a monster roused and destroyed. In contemporary horror were supposed to get our kicks from seeing the action grow darker and more hopeless than our own worst nightmares. ""Oculus"" plays intriguing games with the vagaries of memory and perception but they hinge on bleak episodes of spousal abuse and child neglect. The movie takes place in the childhood home of the heroine Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) where she witnessed her father torture and kill her mother (Katee Sackhoff) and her brother Tim fatally shoot her father (Rory Cochrane). Ten years later when the state releases 21-year-old Tim (Brenton Thwaites) from a mental facility his now-23-year-old sister coerces him into helping her prove that the looking glass made them do it. Gillan a spark plug of an actress imparts her own humming energy to ""Oculus"" as Kaylie marshals her evidence and data-gathering gimmicks. She tracks down the mirror and restores it to its spot in what used to be her dads home office. She arranges an array of devices and alarms that would make the professional ghost hunters in movies like ""The Conjuring"" sick with envy. You may find yourself laughing when she describes how shes ready to register paranormal events like spikes in temperature and contrast mirror-based delusions with laptops recording reality. Thats partly because Gillan makes Kaylie sound as if she has seen too many movies like ""The Conjuring"" but its also because her never-say-die confidence is infectious and funny. Her brother who simply wants to move on with his life cannot resist her confidence. The way Gillan plays Kaylie pushing him into acting with her as a team has put her into overdrive. She makes you feel both elated and a little worried as if shes discovered the youthful invulnerability that she never had in her actual troubled childhood. Then as the visions grow more explicit and the games more macabre the filmmakers cramp Gillans style and take the wind out of Kaylie. In present-day ghost stories as in gambling films you should never bet against the house.

Oculus (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Oculus (R) An earnest but failed attempt to do something different with the horror genre. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/10/2014 Editor rating 2 Mirrors have been as much of a fixture in horror movies as knives and cats that suddenly jump from the shadows. But theyre best in cameos as in the ending of Dressed to Kill or the room 237 scene in The Shining. Oculus revolves entirely around an ornate mirror that is what a gateway to hell? A summoning force for evil spirits? A really ugly piece of furniture from a medieval Pottery Barn? One of the problems with director Mike Flanagans occasionally involving but ultimately dull thriller is that the whole movie hinges on a reflective piece of glass. As kids Kaylie (Annalise Basso) and Tim (Garrett Ryan) watched their parents (Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane) go crazy after a prolonged series of strange events that started when the family bought a mysterious antique mirror. Their mother died a gruesome death and 10-year-old Tim had to shoot his father to protect his older sister who was about to suffer a similar fate. Thirteen years later Tim (Brenton Thwaites) has been declared sane and released to the care of his sister (Karen Gillan) who is engaged and is leading a normal life except for her obsession with that damned mirror. She shows her brother all the research shes conducted The mirror is 14 centuries old and responsible for at least 45 deaths by supernatural forces. Most people at this point would stick it in a dumpster somewhere and be done with it. But Kaylie is intent on finding out what is possessing the antique and she has set up a high-tech lab complete with recording devices and heat sensors to perform a sort of exorcism. She needs answers. She probably also needs the same sort of psychiatric care her brother got. He relies on rational explanations for the strange goings-on and wants to move on. But Kaylie wont be denied. The first half of Oculus works surprisingly well. Gillan and Thwaites are immensely likable as the grown siblings and when they argue and bicker the dialogue doesnt have that forced air of killing time typical in most horror movies. Flanagan also does something clever with the films structure showing the young adults revisiting moments from their childhood by inserting them into the flashbacks (theyre literally watching themselves which works better than constantly cutting back and forth between past and present). Before things start going crazy Cochrane and Sackhoff make for a fine pair of parents (Sackhoff so often cast as a tough chick after her killer run on Battlestar Galactica is refreshing as a nice cheerful mom). The movie gradually reveals some troubling discrepancies in Kaylie and Tims recollections of the past They dont remember every event the same way. But once the main scenario has been established Oculus becomes just another movie about good-looking young people trying to make sense of incomprehensible evil. (I mean really who does that?) Flanagan who co-wrote the script with Jeff Howard also overplays his hand. I can buy the mirror eating a dog sure and I liked how the movie reveals why no one can simply smash it. But I cant get past the scene in which it pretends to be a 911 operator. Sometimes you just have to draw a line. As Oculus builds toward its gruesome (but not unexpected) finale the characters get lost in a series of hallucinations and flashbacks that dont amount to much other than eat up screen time. Worst of all the film simply isnt scary. Flanagan who uses admirable restraint with blood and gore is aiming for a psychological thriller more than he is trying to outdo The Conjuring. Even on that level though the thrills are about as scary as one of those out-of-nowhere cats.modest at best.

(John Estes) By Michael OSullivan April 10 2014 A good carpenter never blames his tools. But neither does he go out and buy a new hammer every time he makes another cabinet. Using the most tried and true of techniques and material ""Oculus"" director Mike Flanagan has crafted a satisfyingly old-fashioned ghost story that in its evocation of shivery dread is the most unnerving poltergeist picture since ""The Conjuring."" A remake of an earlier short -- shot by Flanagan on the cheap in and around Baltimore in 2005 -- ""Oculus"" is the story of a haunted antique mirror known as the Lasser Glass. Over the centuries since its fabrication in 1754 dozens of owners have experienced madness and mysterious often violent death. The movie depicts the efforts of two near-victims to destroy the cursed object. The idea of an artifact inhabited by a malevolent supernatural entity is of course nothing new. Nor are such horror-movie tropes as the spooked dog the staticky television set or camcorder surveillance (thank you ""Paranormal Activity""). Yet its what Flanagan does with these well-worn tools here that counts. The filmmaker may not break new ground but he marshals each of these tools -- and more -- with the skill of a pro laying down a fresh path through familiar territory and deftly skirting cliche. Brenton Thwaites and Karen Gillan play 20-something siblings Tim and Kaylie both of whom as we see in flashbacks were almost killed 10 years ago when their parents (Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane) went bonkers after purchasing the mirror. In the intervening decade Tim has been locked up in a mental facility for the killing of his father while Kaylie has put her time to good use in tracking down the home accessory which she blames for what happened. Set just after Tims release from the hospital the movie is structured around Kaylies elaborate plan to exonerate Tim by proving that the events of 10 years earlier were the results of the mirrors manipulative mind games. To this end she has set up video cameras and other high-tech equipment in their old house to document the activities of the mirror out of which she hopes to lure whoever -- or whatever -- is possessing it. ""Hello again"" Kaylie whispers to this home furnishing from hell adding tauntingly ""You must be hungry."" What Flanagan gets exactly right about this far-fetched scenario is that he never shows us the ""you"" Kaylies talking to. To be sure the trailer suggests there is at least one creepy woman with devil eyes living in the mirror but you would be wrong to assume that the tale is that straightforward. Kaylie and Tims old house also is haunted by those scariest of demons memories. Juvenile actors Garrett Ryan and Annalise Basso play the sibling protagonists as children popping up in the old house like they still live there -- which in a figurative sense they do. The younger actors appear both in flashback sequences and in scenes in which their characters seem to be interacting with their adult selves. Whether its fantasy or mental illness is unclear. Thats the most satisfying aspect of ""Oculus"" -- the way in which Flanagan plays on the power of imagination. Shunning traditional flashback techniques he tells the story in a twisty perception-distorting way that messes with the audiences heads as much as it does with Tims and Kaylies. In that sense using a mirror as the central metaphor for our darkest fears is a fairly brilliant strategy. When Kaylie and Tim look into the glass of course they see nothing but their own reflections.    R. At area theaters.

Johnson ""Oculus"" Kevin C. Johnson ""Oculus"" Kevin C. Johnson ""Oculus"" Inanimate objects including dolls puppets cars TV sets telephones and of course houses have made for some seriously scary movie moments. But a mirror?Thats what serving up the frights in this low-key low-budget chiller that succeeds only if youre willing to accept the premise of shiny-eyed ghouls lurking and stepping out of a mirror.Others will laugh at the idea -- and understandably so. Siblings Kaylie (Karen Gillan) and Tim (Brenton Thwaites) are trying to move past an horrific childhood tragedy glimpsed briefly in the opening scene that left their parents Marie (Katee Sackhoff) and Alan (Rory Cochrane) dead on their floor in their suburban home and Tim in a mental facility.The brainy Kaylie takes her brother under her wing as she tries to prove via an elaborate and technical setup involving video cameras and laptops that their father wasnt crazy when he killed their mother. Its her feeling their parents were taken over by supernatural forces in the ornate vintage mirror that hung in their fathers office.The mirror as Kaylie points out has a centuries-old history that includes all of its previous owners suffering horrible fates. Kaylie acquires the mirror the siblings return to the house where they grew up and the games begin. While this story is told perhaps a bit too sluggishly the film cuts back and forth to a parallel story showing the young Kaylie (St. Louis native Annalise Basso) and Tim (Garrett Ryan) during the events leading up to their parents murders. The flashbacks which get almost as much screen time as the present day story are far more compelling.The subtle slightly derivative ""Oculus"" directed by Mike Flanagan suffers because its never actually scary. It barely uses its R rating until a final scene of shock and an intense set piece involving an apple and a light bulb. Mix that apple and light bulb with a cracked dusty old mirror and something much less than ultimate horror is reflected.What ""Oculus""  Two stars out of four  Run time 143 Rating R  Content Terror violence some disturbing images and brief language Kevin C.

Recent horror movies ranging from the ""Paranormal Activity"" series to ""The Conjuring"" excel at the art of the jump scare though no matter how expertly delivered its a cheap gimmick at best. ""Oculus"" is an exception. Appropriately being co-released by microbudget fear factory Blumhouse Production -- its founder Jason Blum helped turn the scrappy productions ""Paranormal Activity"" and ""The Purge"" into profitable franchises -- much of the new movies chilly atmosphere involves the experiences of two characters in a room with one very ominous mirror. As the haunted object plays tricks on its two would-be victims minds the audience falls prey to the ruse as well. Director Mike Flanagan turns the fragile nature of consciousness into a better fear tactic than any visceral shocks could possibly achieve. ""Oculus"" certainly relies on a familiar toolbox including the occasional cliched moment when something scary materializes right behind an unsuspecting character. But the specifics of the scenario engender a fundamental state of dread that grows heavier with each murky twist. Flanagans script co-written by Jeff Howard and based on an earlier short film nimbly moves between events that transpired 11 years ago and their ramifications in the present In the opening scenes 21-year-old Tim (Brenton Thwaites) is released from a psychotherapy ward after years on lockdown and reunited with his sister Kaylie (Karen Gillan). With a steely resolve she announces that the pair must return to the childhood home and ""kill it"" -- a declaration that immediately establishes a menacing supernatural presence that remains hard to define throughout the movie. But Flanagan quickly fills in a few more pertinent details The siblings youth was disrupted with the arrival of the mirror into the claustrophobic study where their father (Rory Cochrane) worked alone; at some point maybe because of his own lapsing sanity or maybe because the mirror drove him mad their ill-fated father murdered their mother (Katee Sackhoff) at which point young Tim shot him dead. Kaylie has been waiting for her brother to reemerge into society so the two of them can confront the bizarre ancient menace which is apparently responsible for 48 deaths in 400 years. As soon as hes free she snatches up the mirror at a local auction and brings him back to the scene of the crime with camcorders set up to capture their every move over the course of one isolated dreary night. In short order plenty of things go bump in the night but its gradually clear that nothing happening can be taken for granted including Kaylie and Tims own behaviors. At its best ""Oculus"" is a tightly enacted chamber drama that just happens to include supernatural phenomena. The mirror is messing with them at every turn -- and by extension its messing with us. As the plot constantly shifts between modern day events and Kaylee and Tims childhood experiences as they witnessed their parents lapsing sanity ""Oculus""  becomes an effective allegory for the lingering trauma of familial dysfunction. The small ensemble meshes nicely with the sophisticated narrative approach Thwaits as the grown brother maintains a credibly frightened demeanor as he worries that he might be going crazy all over again; Gillian playing the Mulder to Thwaits Scully continually strikes the calculated pose of a true believer even as her own insecurities slowly take over. Their collective fears of the unknown turn this rather basic premise into a sneakily profound meditation on more realistic concerns. The first sign that ""Oculus"" has more on its mind arrives as the adult Tim attempts to shrug off his sisters recollections of supernatural occurrences with the ""fuzzy trace"" theory of human psychology -- essentially false memories derived from inaccurate associations In Tims view their dad was an unfaithful lunatic -- hence the cryptic presence of another woman in his study after hours -- and eventually went ballistic on his wife as a result of their marital tensions. His kids convictions about the nature of these events the thinking goes suggest a history of mental illness in the family. And whos to say whether Tim has it right? As the duo creep around the house evading passing shadows and lashing out blindly in the wrong directions its never entirely clear if any given point of view holds ground. ""Oculus"" keeps digging further into their frightened state thickening the dreary atmosphere at every turn so that even while the outcome of the scenario is fairly predictable early on its continually haunting as it maps out a path to get there. A truly contemporary horror movie its eeriness stems from manipulated cell phone conversations and recorded data on the ubiquitous cameras that may or may not accurately represent events as they transpire. No matter how much technology they have on their side nothing in certain. The two-pronged progression doesnt make things any easier. Past and present continue to merge as this pair of unreliable narrators wander through memories and attempt to act faster than the mirror can anticipate. The ongoing sense of ambiguity is distinctly cinematic forcing viewers to question whether any given moment actually takes place. (One grisly bit in which Kaylee bites into an apple and temporarily believes shes chewing on a lightbulb by mistake harkens back to the infamous ""face peeling"" hallucination in ""Poltergeist."") The very act of watching movies calls into question the way we process reality; ""Oculus"" for all its familiar scares expertly capitalizes on this fundamental power. In recent years few American genre films have managed the extreme spookiness found in many of their overseas brethren. Even while ""Oculus"" plays by the book in individual moments it manages to invent a shrewder context for the events in question. Its not the scenes that matter so much as the way they do (and dont) fit together. It uses subjectivity like a weapon. By contrast last years generally well-liked haunted house effort ""The Conjuring"" capably grappled with issues of faith but failed to unite its bigger ideas with the rudimentary process for freaking us out. In ""Oculus"" the horror is at once deceptively simple and rooted in a deep primal uneasiness. Its scariest aspects are universally familiar By witnessing the two leads fall prey to the ghastly objects manipulation we too become its victims. Reflecting the way our greatest fears lie within our own insecurities the mirror is an ideal metaphor for the horror genres lasting potency. Criticwire Grade A- HOW WILL IT PLAY? Relativity opens ""Oculus"" nationwide this weekend. With little competition it should find respectable returns among the sizable audience for horror films although its primary audience lies on VOD where it should be successful for a long time.

However it is very interesting and intriguing with a very good ending. A movie about past and present colliding. Reply Caesar May 12 2016 1204 pm Yall are tripping. Honestly this one is one of the best horror movies made to date.And very trailblazer-y if I may add. It is true that its got some cliches but nonetheless it breaks with the most common way of making horror. Id give it an A+ to be honest. Reply Jessica May 12 2016 1204 pm Just watched this movie with my boyfriend in Netflix. We werent sure what to expect. This movie turned out to be awesome. The way the story is laid out can be confusing but my boyfriend and I understood the movie the whole time. I would buy this movie. Reply Acid Soup May 12 2016 1204 pm (possible spoiler) Just another cliche formula horror movie where the protagonists fights the paranormal and loses because the latter was invincible and can do magic. On top of that the heroes acted irrationally as usual in order to conveniently fall victim. Reply Sarah May 12 2016 1204 pm Very creepy...I enjoyed this movie because it gets into your head and not only plays tricks on the characters but on you as well.. Mind blowing. Reply hailey May 12 2016 1204 pm im 9 and the movie wasnt even that scary to me Reply Steve May 12 2016 1204 pm 1408 still felt like a victory although bitter sweet as well as the aftertaste with Samuel l Jackson reminding us we never really escape our demons. But oculus? Oculus started out so well but like someone said it kind of got lost. The death of the fiance illusion felt forced the stuck in childhood trauma (with a few moments of lucidity) felt lackluster and without enough struggle against the illusion (her because she was familiar with the mirrors tricks and him trying to rationalize it) and the ending had zero suspense. It felt like it was on rails by the end and so there was no real desire for the movie to end differently. When shes died (predictably with far too many hints) i could have cared less. The fathers malevolence seemed to fade out to simply negligence abs the mothers insanity was dealt with far too quickly to leave a lasting impression. All in all its not a bad movie. But the atmosphere went from brilliantly sinister to meh with a forced and disappointing ending. Reply Kiana May 12 2016 1204 pm honestly this movies fairly good. The main thing that bothered me was the lack of closure. Other than that the concepts used are very spot on. The movies reflection on the human mind expresses how real delusions and hallucinations can be. It shows how hard it is to break through them to understand reality as it really is. This movie shows us how dangerous we are. Very trippy. Reply Joe webber May 12 2016 1204 pm Just saw this movie tonight and have to say its one of the most well thought out and creepy horror movies Ive ever seen it had its moments of confusion but that was the point of this movieconfusion. you are supposed to be just as confused as the two in the house until all the fog clears at the end. Reply SeDon Bo May 12 2016 1204 pm My partner and I watched this movie late at night in our bedroom with all the lights off. The storyline on paper sounded cheesey and lame. It sure had some spooky moments quite a few ""skin crawling"" and ""blanket shielding face"" moments. The jumping back and forth in time was good until the older Tim got involved then it got confusing. Reply Dominic May 12 2016 1204 pm Ok first off anyone that says this movie was garbage is a moron. Plain and simple. The majority of these people that are saying that are saying so from a biased opinion or just too slow to follow along but its ok because the world is full of dumb people. The movie was good and definitely worth a watch. I wasnt necessarily scared of the movie but it was definitely a good watch and definitely better than any horror movie that has come out in a long time. Better than the Conjuring and both of the Insidious movies by far. This is coming from someone who is desensitized from movies and hasnt seen a movie that scared me in over 8 years. Do yourself a favor and WATCH THIS MOVIE. I would definitely watch it again. This is a masterpiece screw what everyone else thinks that claim its a waste of money. Anyone that walked out in this missed out on a lot. Reply Nelis May 12 2016 1204 pm Once again i am really really dissapointed to see such a bad horror movie. It was 100 % predictable 0% scary and worst of all they threw in the "" it is so complex and unexplainable so it must be good"" concept in it... Greetings from the Netherlands Reply Emmit May 12 2016 1204 pm I dont know what movie you people that say this movie is terrible saw...but I saw one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen. I think that you must be desensitized by all the blood and gore bs of modern cinema. I can tell you from personal experience that the scariest thing that you will ever experience in your life is questioning your own sanity. I have had mental problems my whole life seeing things that other people cannot see feeling and seeing things that have made me question the very nature of reality. I have spent time in mental institutions because of this. You that say this movie is terrible more than likely and thank God have not experienced what this is like. Anyway this movie is the scariest movie that I have ever seen. Spend some time questioning your own sanity...and then rewatch the movie...lol...just my opinion. Flame on. Reply Bridgette May 12 2016 1204 pm The movie was ok. The ending was to predictable though in my opinion. They shouldve made it a twist. And the movie wasnt that scary the movie Mirrors is scarier than Oculus. Reply Miranda Jones May 12 2016 1204 pm The only reason that I was going to watch this movie was because of the (Smoking Hot) James Lafferty. And then I watched the trailer and got excited and thought ""This movie is going to be awesome."" So I just got through watching it and if I was rating it 1-10 I would rate it negative infinity. First of all James Lafferty wasnt in there at all and that on its own makes the movie SUCK. I mean I dont want to exaggerate so I would say he was in there for a whole 5 minutes. IF were lucky. And then they want to just randomly put him in the movie and KILL him Kill him with a dull broken plate. By barely touching the side of his neck. And then half a second later after bleeding two drops of blood he dies. Right there. For NO reason. Then my cousin had to convince me to finish the movie and not throw the laptop across the room after they decided to kill the best (hottest) actor ever. And then after I reluctantly agree to finish this awful waste of time film the main character just dies and the boy is handcuffed and WHOOP The movie is over. The end. Congrats Mike Flanagan for producing the worst horror film in the history of worst horror films. If I had a trophy with that on it you would get it (shoved up your butt) Anyone thinking of watching this disgusting film dont waste your time. Life is short go watch Rubber instead. Reply ben May 12 2016 1204 pm Even though its getting mostly positive reviews I feel Oculus is wildly underrated and a modern horror masterpiece which will outlive The Conjuring in cult status. The ending is chilling also. Reply Chris May 12 2016 1204 pm I just saw the movie and was only slightly disappointed. Mostly at the ending. The story itself was a little complex showing both the past and the current events leading up to an overall decent climax. Not excellent just decent. If you have trouble following multiple storylines you probably wont care for Oculus. Especially towards the end when the storylines mesh together for parts. Theres a difference between jump scares and what i call ""true horror"". The jump scares are all about the surprises and this movie does have a few of those. But the ""true horror"" aspect of this film is the uneasy feeling in your gut that lingers with you for hours after a movie. This movie did a pretty good job as casting a suspenseful atmosphere not as good as some others ( a vanishing on seventh street for example) but still pretty good. Its very much a psychological horror that leaves you guessing. i""m not going to go into characters very much because i thought they did a wonderful job as their roles. Some of the people left the theater with groans of displeasure and i can understand why but i really did rather enjoy it. id watch it again for sure. Overall i give ""Oculus"" an 8.5 /10 definitely worth a watch for ""true horror"" fans. Reply Larry May 12 2016 1204 pm Didnt like it. You could see the ending coming from a mile away. Also why are horror movies populated by incredibly stupid people? Reply Bryce May 12 2016 1204 pm It was very hard to follow between their past and present the ending was terrible. Other than that every thing else was alright. Reply Erin May 12 2016 1204 pm Just saw it last night - It seemed like a mix of The Shining and The Conjuring but harder to follow. The way it skipped around felt a little ADD; but I will admit I left the theater feeling very unsettled. Id give it a B+...I liked the ending. Reply dorjee May 12 2016 1204 pm Oculus is the worse movie of the century it was a waste of money time and energy. many people left during the show. not just me all ma frds are complaining about it. if you are planning to go than i suggest you should not to watch this movies. no horor no storycomplete confusion and mix up of past and present through out the movie which torture your mind and put you in complete misery Reply Jen May 12 2016 1204 pm A few of my friends saw this at TIFF in 2013 and have been raving about it ever since and theyre still talking about it. I really hope it come to Toronto or goes to Netflix. I havent seen any really scary haunted house movies in years Reply Jack May 12 2016 1204 pm Isnt this film in wide release?

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Oculus"" is not just a howling good horror film. Its a terrific film by any standard -- a smart character-driven original hair-raiser that creeped the socks off me with no cheap scares. Watching the assured nerve-racking theatrical debut of writer/director Mike Flanagan I felt hed put me on an icy IV drip of dread. ""Oculus"" is a story that could be an account of supernatural happenings or a story seen from the viewpoint of a lunatic. Its genuinely unpredictable. The key players are twenty-something Kaylie Russell (Karen Gillan) and her slightly younger brother Tim (Brenton Thwaites) reunited after his decadelong stint in a psychiatric hospital. The siblings are still emotionally wounded by the violent deaths of their parents (Rory Cochrane and Ketee Sackhoff) 11 years earlier. Kaylie blames occult forces inside the Lasser Glass a centuries-old mirror the family owned. She intends to prove it rigging their childhood home with cameras aimed at the antique looking glass and persuading Tim to keep an overnight vigil with her. Tim agrees in hopes of helping her banish what he sees as a destructive fantasy. The Newton Brothers unsettling score and Michael Fimognaris ominous cinematography contribute to the aura of grotesque menace. From its dark opening through its shattering endgame ""Oculus"" keeps you guessing off-balance worried. Youre never certain whether a paranormal entity is present or if the deeply troubled siblings are descending into madness. Flanagan creates a remorselessly malignant atmosphere shuffling past and present memory and imagination in mind-bending twists that recall ""Memento"" and ""Inception."" He has clearly studied the masters of suspense and learned well. Form an orderly line horror fans.

"Oculus movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies REVIEW Oculus  Oculus John Estes Lasser Productions Garrett Ryan and Annalise Basso star in ""Oculus."" Garrett Ryan and Annalise Basso star in ""Oculus."" (John Estes Lasser Productions) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Happily longer on chills than entrails the crafty new horror film ""Oculus"" is about a haunted mirror. Three years ago writer-director Mike Flanagan made the similarly low-budget ""Absentia"" which dealt with a haunted pedestrian underpass. In this genre its good to be specific.Certainly Flanagan whose latest comes from a 2005 short film has learned the virtues of a simple idea fruitfully elaborated. His co-writer Jeff Howard worked on both the short version of ""Oculus"" and the feature version. The script takes the time to make us care about the fates of a brother and a sister we meet first in flashback then 11 years later. In the prologue young Kaylie (Annalise Basso) and Tim (Garrett Ryan) are beset in their home by ... were not sure exactly. Demon-eyed specters? Their murderous father played by Rory Cochrane? Mom or demon-mom portrayed by Katee Sackhoff? Its quick and evocative this appetizer and ""Oculus"" brings us up to speed efficiently. The adult Tim -- charged with the murder of his parents that long-ago night -- is about to be released from a mental institution. Hes played by promising Australian actor Brenton Thwaites; in the key role ""Dr. Who"" alum Karen Gillan is the adult Kaylie driver of the narrative determined to prove her brothers innocence.The mirror did it Carved were told out of precious ""Bavarian black cedar"" the antique mirror hangs on the wall of dads home office in the childhood sequences in ""Oculus."" Most horror films are relatively sparing in their use of back story flashback; the novelty here which works well until the last 10 minutes or so is Flanagans tight interweave between past- and present-day action tight enough to inch into pure dreamy hallucination. Having retrieved the mirror and returned it to the scene of the crime Gillans Kaylie sets up a three-camera videography experiment in their late fathers home office in order to record whatever evil spirits or reflections the mirror can throw at her and Tim. Mission ""to kill it"" Kaylie says. Gillan rattles through a considerable amount of exposition in ""Oculus"" and she has a way of doing so that makes the whole premise faintly comic on the surface yet completely grave underneath. The younger actors in the flashback half of the movie undergo a lot of realistic anguish; there are times when the films spooky fun becomes grim enough to disqualify itself as fun. But Flanagans a skillful director and editor and simply by placing the camera in logical but unusual places such as high above and slightly in front of a performer the tension increases moment by moment ghost by ghost frightening reflection by reflection. Referencing bits of ""The Shining"" ""The Stepfather"" and a few other standards ""Oculus"" lacks a big finish. It does not however lack for sequel possibilities.mjphillipstribune.com""Oculus"" - 3 starsMPAA rating R (for terror violence some disturbing images and brief language)Running time 144Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Movies Entertainment Katee Sackhoff The Shining (movie) Latest movie reviews REVIEW Under the Skin  1/2 REVIEW Draft Day  1/2 Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising75deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-oculus-movie-review-20140410,0,2768788.column",200,oculus20,oculus,chicagotribune

(Relativity Media) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday April 10 2014 1200 PM Title Oculus Film Info With Karen Gillan  Brenton Thwaites. Mirror mirror on the way whos the biggest missed opportunity of all? Director Mike Flanagan (145 R Violence gore language. Area theaters. Its often said that comedy is in the editing. The makers of ""Oculus"" apparently believe that horror also is in the editing. So this skittish but well-shot scary movie constantly jumps back and forth between the characters past and present. The result a dangerously cracked creep flick. As kids Tim and his older sister Kaylie watched as their dad (Rory Cochrane) became possessed by a strange spirit that lived inside an antique mirror. Mom Marie (Katee Sackhoff of ""Battlestar Galactica"") was the first to sense something wasnt right. But it was too late -- dad went on a rampage accompanied by a ghoul called Marisol. Marie was tortured and killed and as dad stalked the kids young Tim had to shoot him. Eleven years later now-21-year-old Tim (Brenton Thwaites) is being released from a mental hospital. Kaylie (Karen Gillan) now an antique-auction employee is waiting for him. But so is the deadly mirror which Kaylie has found and set up in front of a slew of cameras and devices. She hopes to clear Tims name and record the real villain the ghoul that has spent some 400 years victimizing the owners of the mirror. Only the fiend isnt finished with Kaylie and Tim just yet. Theres plenty of shivery mood in ""Oculus."" Thwaites and Gillan make good impressions. With her clear direct manner and defiantly swinging ponytail Gillan might make a fine D.A. on a legal TV show. But here the story is interwoven with the childhood moments and the whole film is undercut because of that. Director Mike Flanagan sets the groundwork for what presumably will be a franchise like the ""Insidious"" films to name just one. But unlike ""Mama"" or many other modern demon flicks ""Oculus"" may not live to see more evil.

Actually the mirror directly led to their murders and threatened their own lives. At least thats what Kaylie staunchly believes.Tim is more of a realist He believes his mother (Katee Sackoff) had a psychological breakdown and his father (Rory Cochrane) was a murderer.Any way you look at it theyve suffered terribly. But theyre survivors. Kaylie (played as a child by Annalise Basso) endured the foster care system. Tim (played in youth by Garrett Ryan)) was shipped off to a mental institution.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersTims just been released after 10 years. So the first thing his sister suggests is a trip back to their childhood home to destroy the wickedly inscrutable mirror that caused all the havoc in their lives. It certainly would not have been on the list of activities recommended by Tims encouraging therapist (Miguel Sandoval).It helps that the pair is likable though in markedly different ways. Kaylie is tough determined and fiercely loyal. Tim is watchful intelligent and vulnerable.Now 23 Kaylie is hell-bent on destroying the mirror that her research revealed as a murderous ornament dating to the 1700s. Conveniently she works for the auction house selling the mirror and arranges to transport it to their childhood home empty for the decade since the tragic deaths.The spooky tale of the mirrors malevolence has some cracks in its mythology. The garish-looking antique looks like it belongs in a house of ill repute. Instead it graced the elegant walls of Balmoral Castle the Scottish vacation residence of the British royal family. That the royals let such a substantial piece out of their hands only to have it turn up in the home office of a suburban American family seems a bit of a stretch even for a ghost story.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare A woman tries to clear her brothers name after he was convicted of murder. She does this by proving that the crime was committed by a supernatural phenomenon. VPCThe mirror infects the minds of those who peer into it creating distorted visions playing on fears and inducing vicious behavior. If Kaylie believes with such certainty in its powers of possession why would she risk her life and her brothers to destroy it?Logic aside a mounting sense of dread permeates the film. Thankfully suspense trumps blood and guts. The conclusion however is anti-climactic.Writer-director Mike Flanagans film -- expanded from his 2005 short -- has echoes of Paranormal Activityand The Shining. However its central conflict -- the occult vs. reason -- is a viable evergreen staple of the horror genre. The notion of children endangered by the sinister behavior of their parents intensifies the fear.Oculus creepiness is intensified by an eerily thrumming electronic score. The supernatural thriller is at its most enthralling when it sets up the siblings in mind-bending scenes in which its nearly impossible to distinguish between imagination and reality. 60 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/PUNilu",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/04/10/oculus-review/6888947/,200,oculus22,oculus,usatoday

Photo John Estes /Lasser Productions MOVIE REVIEW Oculus Running time 105 minutes. Rated R (terror violence disturbing images). At the Orpheum the Battery Park City others. If youve just been discharged after 11 years in a mental institution its probably not a great idea to join your sister for a night in the same house where you killed Dad -- while he was trying to strangle your sister just after emptying a revolver into your homicidally insane mom. Credit Mike Flanagans clever twisty and scary supernatural sleeper ""Oculus for skillfully selling its preposterous premise though that the very tightly wound Kaylie (Karen Gillan of ""Doctor Who) now 23 could somehow convince 21-year-old sibling Tim (Brenton Thwaites) that it would be cathartic for both of them to prove that their late parents were innocent victims of demonic possession. Kaylie has elaborately rigged up the conveniently unsold old family home with an impressive array of paranormal recording and safety devices. Karen Gillan stars in ""Oculus.""Photo John Estes/Lasser Productions And more important shes gone to work for an auction house in order to temporarily return the demonic piece de resistance to Dads old den an antique mirror with a significant crack. Poor Tim starts wondering if Kaylie is ready for her own padded room when she starts producing computer printouts that she claims link the mirror to more than 40 gruesome deaths going back to 17th-century Scotland. Then plants start dying -- the first sign of Moms deteriorating mental health -- and the siblings start suffering from delusions that dont quite match the playbacks on Kaylies iMacs. Director Flanagan ratchets up the suspense by intercutting their scenes with flashbacks of the younger Kaylie and Tim (Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan good matches for the older actors) who become increasingly terrified by the bizarre behavior of Dad (Rory Cochrane) and Mom (Katee Sackhoff). Was dear old Dad really having an affair with a mysterious woman in his den the older versions of Tim and Kaylie wonder -- or did the mirror plant that idea (which they conveyed to Mom) in their heads? Shocks abound as the lines between delusion and reality are repeatedly crossed during the evening. Like the similar and slightly superior ""The Conjuring last summer ""Oculus eschews the buckets of gore common to R-rated horror movies and takes a relatively subtle psychological approach -- even if the somewhat disappointing ending leaves the door open for a sequel (or three).

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Paranormal thrillers have become so plentiful and so utterly predictable in their methods that its tempting to celebrate any big-screen ghost story that even modestly strays from formula. The derivative evil-mirror potboiler Oculus doesnt exactly shatter the cliches of the genre but it does distort them in a couple of interesting ways beginning with a creative reversal of the usual vengeful-spirit plot This time its the haunted not the haunter who wants a little payback. Eleven years after malevolent forces tore her family apart Kaylie (Doctor Whos Karen Gillan) has tracked down the cursed culpable object a possessed vanity mirror she hopes to prove was responsible for the death of her parents. This doesnt sit well with her younger brother Tim (Brenton Thwaites) who was only 10 when he was locked up for killing their dad and has spent the last decade convincing himself that the doctors were right for doing so. Oculus hits its stride around the time the two converge on the old family home where Kaylie has set up an elaborate system of cameras thermometers and unfortunately ineffectual safety precautions. For all his adherence to hoary haunted-house convention writer-director Mike Flanagan is smart enough to create some real dramatic tension between his mutually traumatized protagonists--two siblings wrestling with the horrors of their shared childhood in conflicting ways. (Just as Tim needs to deny his memories of spectral abuse in order to complete his recovery process Kaylie finds the supernatural explanation of events much more comforting than the alternative.) Theres something unmistakably Stephen King about much of Oculus Flanagan cuts between past and present a la It before shrewdly blurring those lines in the films tumultuous second half. He also has Kaylie read aloud the long sordid history of the mirror--a dread-building strategy lifted from both The Shining and ""1408."" At the same time the ghost itself operates in a very Freddy Krueger-like manner confusing reality and fantasy in the minds of its victims. Perhaps thats why Kaylie seems to have taken some tips from Nightmare On Elm Streets Nancy even constructing a dangerous booby trap that--as Chekhov might helpfully note--is introduced in the first act. Reasonably clever and never as generic as its title might suggest Oculus nevertheless falters in the one area that should have been a given the conception of potent original scares. Fear is as subjective as humor and there may be plenty who find the films litany of tropes--the haggish spirit the father gone Jack Torrance--plenty effective. But that doesnt excuse the overall familiarity of such terror tactics the sense that weve seen all of this mayhem staged better elsewhere. (Credit where credits due Katee Sackhoff of Battlestar Galactica fame tackles the thankless role of the heroes doomed mother with more conviction than was probably strictly necessary.) No jaded horror fans are going to get goosebumps from Oculus recycled tricks. But they may experience a chill of delight watching Gillan who swells with righteous satisfaction upon the first sign of trouble as though her character is actually willing the dark spirits into existence just to prove her point. She also takes a big accidental bite out of a lightbulb. Again any deviation is welcome.

TWITTER A brother and sister attempt to destroy the spirit-possessed mirror that killed their parents. A brother and sister face off against the mysterious force that destroyed their childhood in Mike Flanagans Oculus an effective little creeper that makes the most of its ghost-hunting conceit. Key art focusing on our heroes as young kids fails to capture the well-balanced nature of the yarn which is as involving in its present-tense action as in the extended flashbacks showing the horrors that the children witnessed. But strong word-of-mouth should help genre fans find the picture which has no fright-flick competition in theaters at the moment save for a Jim Jarmusch vampire film that will never be mistaken for fanboy fare. Sequels are a possibility though screenwriters would be unable to reuse the devices responsible for much of this outings appeal. When they were young Kaylie and Tim (Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan) were moved into a big new home by their parents (Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane) who very soon succumbed to dark forces. While dad grew increasingly secretive and distracted spending all his time locked in his home office mom went insane. When she grew so dangerous that she threatened the children dad killed her in a domestic struggle. Tim traumatized shot him dead. Or so Tims shrinks say. Upon his release from a mental institution 11 years later authorities declare that Tim (now played by Brenton Thwaites) ""is a healthy adult"" ready to reenter society. Kaylie (Karen Gillan) on the other hand still believes in the version of events the children pieced together at the time Their parents were controlled by a spirit residing in the beautiful ornate mirror Dad bought for his new office a mirror they tried and failed to break before it was sold in the aftermath of the killings. REVIEW Main Tera Hero (Im Your Hero) Now having tracked down the mirror at an estate auction and returned it to its place in their old house Kaylie intends to document its powers before destroying it with Tims help. She has turned the house into an elaborate observational machine building ingenious countermeasures she thinks will record any paranormal activity even if the mirror gets inside their heads making them think they see things that arent there. While Tim argues with her plans parroting the psychological explanations of events he has heard for years she uses an array of video cameras and computers to recount the history of this evil looking glass -- which has caused four centuries of deaths in the households that owned it -- and prove its power is real. Flanagan and co-writer Jeff Howard get good mileage out of Kaylies no-nonsense planning demonstrating the strength of ""the Lasser glass"" by showing how she hopes to foil its efforts to protect itself; the certainty of Gillans performance introduces another layer of unease as the debate between the siblings heats up leading us to wonder if Tim is right in his more prosaic explanation of events. That possibility is thrown out in one of the films cleverest moments which involves Kaylies recording equipment and the characters faltering hold on their senses. Given the importance of character-generated video here its a relief the filmmakers chose not to rely on a found-footage conceit; for once our heroes have an excellent reason to view all the action through cameras but limiting the audience to those perspectives would have resulted in a more ordinary film. As the scares pick up pace and ghost-induced hallucinations dominate the action the past and present start to overlap with each other; the adults watch their younger selves enduring horrors they cant undo. These visions have a poetic quality at first but as they proliferate (and as more and more of the mirrors victims materialize in the house) the films tension between objective and perceived realities loses some of its power. Having tasked us with the job of separating one from the other Flanagan needs to preserve some shred of our hope that we can do so. If we lose that briefly though the storys conclusion benefits from a closure that is satisfying despite -- and even because of -- its predictability.

Thats the sort of rhetorical query facing siblings Kaylie (Karen Gillan) and Tim (Brenton Thwaites) who reunite after a decade to take care of some unfinished supernatural business. Mike Flanagans well-made if featherweight horror movie gives the characters a pretty cool antagonist an antique mirror known as the Lasser Glass that has the uncanny habit of persuading its owners to commit murder and suicide. That sad fate befell Kaylie and Tims parents (Katee Sackhoff and Rory Cochrane) whom we see in flashback sequences interwoven with the siblings present-day attempts to conquer this evil piece of furniture. Flanagan has lots of fun with the crisscrossing timelines in which the protagonists can never be sure if what theyre seeing is figment or foe Glowing-eyed ghosts flit menacingly and Kaylie has a memorably cringeworthy moment involving a broken lightbulb that she mistakes for an apple. Yet the familial discord the film attempts to plumb for emotional effect never jells into anything substantial. For all its genre delights Oculus is little more than a well-tooled creepshow.

Why Summer Movie Season Is Kicking Off in April With Captain America Sequel An uneven metaphorical core and a decidedly incomplete mythology prevents ""Oculus"" from reflecting anything truly haunting If last summers ""The Conjuring"" offered possession stories their classiest entry in decades Mike Flanagans ""Oculus"" lends elegance to haunted object movies a subgenre distinguished by such dubious classics as ""Death Bed The Bed That Eats."" Flanagan expanding his own 2006 short film to feature length finds both humanity and horror in the story of two siblings who reunite to exorcise a possessed mirror but the films uneven metaphorical core and a decidedly incomplete mythology prevents ""Oculus"" from reflecting anything truly haunting. See video Oculus Trailer Features Brenton Thwaites Karen Gillan Battling Haunted Mirror Karen Gillan (TVs ""Doctor Who"") plays Kaylie Russell a young woman who reunites with her brother Tim (Brenton Thwaites) upon his release from criminal institutionalization in order to make good on a promise they made to one another as children. Returning to their childhood home for the first time in 11 years they set up a barrage of cameras and other accoutrements in order to capture proof that a malignant force in an antique mirror is responsible for the deaths of their parents Marie (Katee Sackhoff) and Alan (Rory Cochrane). Despite their meticulous precautions alarms and fail-safes Kaylie and Tim quickly start experiencing strange visions that not only dont reflect reality but also undermine their efforts to obtain objective evidence of supernatural forces. But after they find themselves unwittingly reliving the dysfunction and violence that led to their parents murder Kaylie and Tim begin questioning whether or not they can go through with their plan -- or even survive the night. Combining the adult Kaylie and Tims current endeavor with a flashback narrative that leads up to the murder for which Tim was institutionalized Flanagan expertly creates a web of mystery that drives the audience towards a genuinely terrifying climax. Although the present-day story guarantees that the duo survives the flashback story it manages never to undermine suspense especially as their grown-up selves begin questioning whether ghosts and spirits were to blame or theyve merely concocted the mirror story to ignore the harrowing truths about a painful childhood trauma. Thankfully the movie more or less validates their supernatural phobias from the outset both providing a detailed history of the mirrors destructive path and creating an escalating series of horrors that rely liberally upon both classic scare tactics and subtler mind games. From the wincing pain of pulling off a fingernail to the looming presence of glowing-eyed specters ""Oculus"" pulls out all of the stops to keep the audience on its toes. Also read Afflicted Review Clever But Not Enough to Overcome Two Tired Horror Sub-Genres Even with a litany of marital problems beleaguering the increasingly troubled parents however the film never quite pulls off the notion that all of Kaylie and Tims fears revisited and re-experienced are manifestations of the adolescent turmoil created by their subconscious a decade earlier. Maintaining the constant battle between the siblings to explain or refute supernatural occurrences happening around them Flanagan and co-screenwriter Jeff Howards efforts to provide a psychological foundation for their characters behavior too often comes across as a stilted debate between two first-year psych majors trying to out-diagnose one another with information gleaned from WebMD searches. That said both pairs of actors playing the siblings are pretty remarkable especially Annalisse Basso and Garrett Ryan as the younger Kaylie and Tim. Witnessing the deterioration of not just their parents marriage but also their sanity Basso and Ryan avoid being either overly petulant or precociously mature regarding the vagaries of the adult world with an appropriate and resonant mixture of bewilderment and terror. As their elder counterparts Gillan plays Kaylies determination so rigidly and intensely that it feels like she should have been the one institutionalized while Thwaites offers the right amount of incredulity (and later irrefutable acceptance) that theyre confronting forces more powerful than they can control. Also read Dom Hemingway Review Jude Law Goes Full Character Actor in This Hilarious but Hollow Gangster Comedy Although there are several bone-chilling scares some supernatural and others frighteningly corporeal the film doesnt pay off strongly because it never explains the ""motives"" of the evil force within the mirror nor establishes what it means if that force succeeds (or fails) in manipulating its owners into committing murder. Do those things matter? Maybe or maybe not depending on if you merely want to be shaken up or truly disturbed. ""Oculus"" might be successfully unsettling and claustrophobic as it unfolds but Flanagans film still leaves us with more questions than answers; this movie is no ""Death Bed"" but the one Flanagan forces audiences to lay in nevertheless isnt made quite as well as it needs to be.

"Oculus Review Mike Flanagans Intricate Thriller | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Toronto Film Review Oculus Dennis Harvey Film Critic 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr September 15 2013 | 1157PM PT Mike Flanagans latest is an impressively intricate supernatural thriller cleverly complex if not quite as scary or memorable as one might have hoped. Five years before ""Absentia"" a haunting and character-rich horror tale Mike Flanagan directed 2006s ""Oculus The Man With the Plan"" a half-hour fright film that won raves from genre fans on the fest circuit. His new feature expands it into an impressively intricate supernatural thriller in which an orphaned brother and sister return to destroy the antique mirror they think killed their parents years earlier. Cleverly complex if not quite as scary or memorable as one might have hoped ""Oculus"" should expand on the underseen ""Absentias"" buzz (though probably still mostly through home formats) and boost Flanagan another step up the industry ladder. In 2002 the Russell clan moved into a nice new suburban house buying some upscale decor items to celebrate. Among them was a roughly 300-year-old wall mirror hung in the home office of dad Alan (Rory Cochrane). Soon he was spending an inordinate amount of time locked in there overheard talking to a ""lady"" who was never seen coming or going and manifesting increasingly secretive irrational behavior. Mom Marie (Katee Sackhoff) grew concerned with his odd manner then started losing grip herself. The ultimate result two dead adults two surviving but permanently traumatized children. After that 10-year-old Tim was sent to a juvenile mental institution that hes being released from now on the brink of his 21st birthday. (Hes played as an adult by Brenton Thwaites.) His doctor (Miguel Sandoval) is confident that hes finally fully put into perspective the delusions that have plagued him since his parents demise. Reuniting with older sister Kaylie (Gillan) however he finds she still holds tight to the version of events hes since renounced. In fact after spending years in foster-care homes she began an auction-house career solely to regain possession of the ""Lasser Glass"" the Russells once owned. (Shes also uncovered the long history of grotesque and inexplicable deaths suffered by prior owners.) Having inherited the house they last lived in together Kaylie pushes reluctant Tim into participating into the elaborate experiment shes set up to document the mirrors malevolent supernatural powers -- and absolve the family of lingering domestic-violence-turned-deadly accusations -- before they destroy it for good. This involves rigging multiple surveillance cameras battery-run backup lighting (should electricity fail) regular check-in calls from her fiance (James Lafferty) scattered houseplants (the mirror is said to wither them) even a dog (canines tend to bark hysterically at the antique then disappear). Naturally just when it seems Tims skepticism is justified signs occur making it very clear that the mirror does indeed still possess a malignant force. From this point Flanagan and Jeff Howards script goes into overdrive not merely with the usual false scares and ""gotcha"" moments but with a genuinely complicated series of reality inversions that have our protagonists increasingly unable to differentiate between their childhood recollections (Annalise Basso and Garrett Ryan play the preadolescent siblings) or even between whats actually happening now and what tricks the mirror plays on their perception. Needless to say they are outmatched. While theres a certain budget-friendly claustrophobia and some thematic familiarity (especially of the ""Amityville Horror"" type) to these goings-on ""Ocular"" succeeds in keeping the viewers bearings unsettled as the helmers effective building of dread curdles into a series of narrative twists as dislocating as an Escher-drawn staircase. The only significant flaw is that the mirror never really develops much personality of its own; its just something bad. Theres a seemingly dominant ghoul glimpsed occasionally but she just resembles another glowing-eyed stringy-haired ghost like her past victims which in turn look like a lot of recent ""Ring""-modeled horror specters. Performances are generally strong and tech/design contributions get a lot out of action largely confined to a few bare rooms. The Newton Brothers ominously pulsing score is wildly different from the Lalo Schifrin-style funky 70s sounds they provided for Toronto fest closer ""Life of Crime.""
