Jason Bateman stars in and directs this blackish comedy about a suffocating couple (Christoper Walken and Maryann Plunkett) whose guerilla-style exercises in video tomfoolery made them the darlings of the underground art world. Bateman and Nicole Kidman too old to convincingly pull off this sibling pair would have fared better as the parents. (The part of sister Annie Fang would have made a great comeback role for Lindsay Lohan.) For too much of its running time Fang lacks bite most notably when hints of incest an apparent familial byproduct are brushed off almost as soon as they surface. A touch of mystery (are their folks dead or is it another elaborately staged prank?) moves things further uphill until an unforeseen third act reveal cascades into a means-justifying end. 2015. -- Scott Marks This movie is not currently in theaters.

Far less broad and gleefully offensive than Batemans directorial debut 2013s ""Bad Words"" the film is a sometimes awkward but often winning family story that veers between dramatic scenes delivered by Nicole Kidman and Bateman and the eccentric comic stylings of Christopher Walken who steals every scene hes in as a performance artist who used his kids in a series of elaborate public provocations. ""This is not Bad Words"" said Bateman when he introduced the film at the Winter Garden on Monday. ""Its a drama with some funny parts in it."" Also Read Torontos Top 10 Sales Titles From Michael Moore and Jason Bateman to Jonas Cuaron But when those funny parts feature Walken as a guy whose idea of art is inciting insurrection at a fast-food chicken stand and whose first extended scene makes liberal use of the phrase ""titty shot"" the humor has the potential to overwhelm the dramatic story of adult children who need to break with their parents. The fact that it doesnt is a tribute to a story by novelist Kevin Wilson and screenwriter David Lindsay-Abaire that is ready to acknowledge how eccentricity can simultaneously be amusing and harmful and a tribute to Batemans growth as a director. The film initially developed by Kidmans Blossom Films centers on Bateman and Kidman as Buster and Annie Fang the grown children of Caleb and Camille played by Walken and Maryann Plunkett. Convinced that the only true art can happen in unregulated public spaces Caleb (abetted by his slightly less eager wife) uses his kids as accomplices in elaborate performances that include a fake bank robbery. But now that Buster and Annie have left home and gone on to careers as a novelist and actress respectively Caleb and Camilles art has suffered. So when the couple goes missing under suspicious circumstances that suggest foul play Annie immediately jumps to the conclusion that its nothing but another piece of art. Also Read Trumbo Director Jay Roach Slams Donald Trump for Wisdom Deficit (Video) Walkens droll performance dominates the movie to a certain degree; hes the one who gets quotable lines like ""You have kids youre going to damage them. So what?"" But by the end the heart of the film lies in the decision that Buster and Annie must make and on the intricacies of the parent-child bond. ""The Family Fang"" is kind of messy but also fun and touching; its a definite step forward for Bateman as a director who said afterwards that the hardest part of the job was to keep his cool while acting alongside Walken one of his idols. When he and Walken were asked in a post-screening Qamp;A if theyd studied performance artists in preparation for the film Walken said hed been around performance art for most of his life in New York City. Then Bateman shrugged. ""A guy once defecated in front of me in the middle of the day on Sixth Avenue"" he said. ""But I dont know if he was doing a piece.""

But its a marked improvement over director Jason Batemans first film the puerile ""Bad Words"" and he shows a real know-how for character and the interlocking dynamics that make families tick.Bateman and Nicole Kidman star as Baxter and Annie Fang siblings who grew up with improv-artist parents staging guerrilla performances for unsuspecting bystanders. Those acts which cast the kids in key roles made the Fangs minor celebrities in the art world but left them estranged as a family unit.The family (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett play the parents) comes back together when Baxter is injured in an accident but old wounds reopen when mom and dad attempt a new prank. When the parents turn up missing after a weekend trip Baxter and Annie are left to decipher whether their disappearance is another act of ""art.""Walken is a natural as a whacked-out prankster Kidman is strong as an actress adrift in middle age and Bateman does a low-simmer version of his disaffected cynic character. But ""The Family Fang"" based on Kevin Wilsons 2011 novel hits a brick wall midway and cant figure out a way around it.Bateman knows his fractured family well but ""Fang"" doesnt give him enough to chew on. The characters are all scarred but the film doesnt leave a mark.agrahamdetroitnews.comThe Family FangGRADE C+Rated R for some languageRunning time 105 minutes 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/26YNyDa MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/05/06/review-family-leaves-scars-batemans-fang/83983314/,200,thefamily(2013)2,thefamily(2013),detroitnews
"Jason Bateman Nicole Kidman Christopher Walken bring bite to their roles in The Family Fang - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Jason Bateman Nicole Kidman Christopher Walken bring bite to their roles in The Family Fang Nicole Kidman as Annie Fang and Jason Bateman as Baxter Fang in the movie ""The Family Fang."" Starz Digital Nicole Kidman as Annie Fang and Jason Bateman as Baxter Fang in the movie ""The Family Fang."" Nicole Kidman as Annie Fang and Jason Bateman as Baxter Fang in the movie ""The Family Fang."" (Starz Digital) Mark Olsen Based on the popular 2011 novel of the same name by Kevin Wilson ""The Family Fang"" has been adapted for the screen by David Lindsay-Abaire and directed by Jason Bateman claiming its own surprising territory with a tone that is by turns darkly comic and bleakly morose. The story grapples with the traumas that parents unconsciously inflict on their children and the struggles for children to move beyond the failings of their parents. Its heavy stuff served with a light touch.In the film Bateman stars as Baxter Fang who with his sister Annie (Nicole Kidman) took part as children in their parents performance art projects that mostly found them making awkward public spectacles of themselves. Baxter has grown to be a struggling novelist and half-hearted magazine journalist; Annie has become an actress of moderate acclaim seemingly already on the downslope of her career. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story When their parents Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken Maryann Plunkett) go missing after apparently being abducted from a highway rest stop Baxter and Annie are left to wonder if this is another art project hoax. Real or not in their parents absence brother and sister must finally face the aftermath of their unusual childhoods and find a way out of their respective ruts.Batemans previous feature as director and star 2013s ""Bad Words"" was a more straightforward comedy albeit one rife with a dry acerbic sensibility. He adapts himself well to the dramatic elements of ""The Family Fang"" navigating the emotional undercurrents that keep the film from becoming the irksome quirk-fest it might be in different hands. Perhaps by connecting to his own experiences as a child actor theres a weight to Batemans performance here that feels new distinct from the affably put-upon everyman persona of his more mainstream commercial work or even TVs ""Arrested Development.""Bateman the director even manages to get something different from Christopher Walken as the cruelly oblivious patriarch of the Fang family. The hint of menace that gilds even Walkens sunniest performances is here allowed to infect the character like a stain. He believes in what he did in the name of art and doesnt mind whatever damage he may have caused around him while his wife and kids seem more circumspect. Trailer The Family Fang Official trailer for The Family Fang Official trailer for The Family Fang See more videos Kidman remains a riveting screen presence capable of portraying deep internal conflicts with a placid opacity. Just as one wonders about Batemans personal connection to his character watching Kidman tangle in a scene with a pushy film director who suddenly wants Annie to do a topless scene or listen to another woman scold her for her behavior its hard not to wonder if she is tapping into the sense memory of disappointment and anger she may have felt in similar situations.The story touches on the dynamic of the Fang parents just enough to give a sense of their own strains and complications apart from their kids. Maryann Plunkett conveys just the right amount of worn patience as his wife and artistic partner Camille while Kathryn Hahn plays a younger Camille in flashbacks. Overall the film feels more carefully crafted than ""Bad Words"" with Bateman again working with cinematographer Ken Seng to create a lived-in look of muted autumnal colors. Composer Carter Burwell a recent Oscar nominee for ""Carol"" turns in another deeply evocative score.For a project that is a showcase for his talents as both actor and director Bateman never gets too showy on either front keeping the emotions of the film at something of a restrained simmer. ""The Family Fang"" builds to a quiet power in its final moments of reconciliation giving Annie and Baxter at last a new future from the remains of their past.------------""The Family Fang.""Running time 1 hour and 45 minutes.Rated R for some language.

Adulthood frees Annie (Nicole Kidman) and Baxter (Jason Bateman) from the family act if not its emotional fallout; as grown-ups theyre a mess.

Given Hollywoods built-in penchant for drama how is it none of the established awards shows have come up with a Comeback Award? From Frank Sinatra to Sally Field to Rob Reiner from Ron Howard to Cher to John Travolta from Bryan Cranston to Robert Downey Jr. from Halle Berry to Matthew McConaughey theres nothing like a comeback story. To wit Jason Bateman. A generation after his competent acting work on middling sitcoms such as ""Silver Spoons"" and ""The Hogan Family"" and the disaster that was the feature film ""Teen Wolf Too"" not to mention his addictions and his setbacks Bateman has emerged as one of the most interesting character actors AND one of the most promising directors around. Bateman directs and stars in ""The Family Fang"" and for Bateman the filmmaker and Bateman the actor its as good as hes ever been. Based on the 2011 novel by Kevin Wilson ""The Family Fang"" is a darkly Freudian story about a legendary avant-garde performance-art couple named Caleb and Camille who used their young children as pawns in captivatingly cruel pieces ranging from a false bank robbery to a Times Square performance in which the children sang about wanting to murder their parents to a production of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in which their children Baxter and Annie had little choice but to embrace and kiss one another in front of the entire community. Cut to present day. Annie (Nicole Kidman) is an actress; Baxter (Jason Bateman) is a novelist. Neither has achieved the heights theyd hoped for. Meanwhile their now-elderly parents Caleb (Christopher Walken) and Camille (Maryann Plunkett) legendary inventors of the elaborate extremely long con are still plying their trade. Caleb and Camille are so devoted to their art they treat their own grown children as nuisances who used to be props. And even as Annie and Baxter tell each other theyve risen above their parents nonsense theyre not entirely sure. Bateman and Kidman have extraordinarily solid chemistry as grown-up siblings who cling to each other in the face of storm after storm. Christopher Walken gives one of his least affected and most genuine performances in recent years as the narcissistic Caleb who comes THIS CLOSE to believing his own hyperbole. Walkens work is so powerful and Calebs line of bull--- is so electric we can see how his grown children would fall for his con once again. Even when ""The Family Fang"" stretches credulity we stay with it. Bateman knows how to tell a story. 1/2 Starz Digital presents a film directed by Jason Bateman and written by David Lindsay-Abaire based on the novel by Kevin Wilson. Running time 105 minutes. Rated R (for some language). Opens Friday at the Music Box Theatre and on demand.

Theater Edina. A solid historical drama opposing racism xenophobia and weak math skills. In 1913 the European scientific world discovered an unimaginable genius in the form of a poor ill-educated Hindu clerk from India. Srinivasa Ramanujans understanding of mathematical hypotheses stunned the British academics who offered him a scholarship to study at Trinity College Cambridge. He overcame religious objections against making the journey moving to a nation that long subjugated his own studying under Godfrey Hardy and teaming with him in groundbreaking research. Having been in one characters description ""alone in his mind his whole life"" he became a recognized theorist without living equal. Dev Patel plays the title part with admirable dignity as he deflects spoken and at times hardfisted prejudice as well as Englands dreadful cooking and sickening weather. Jeremy Irons is sublime as the life-transforming scholar who respects Ramanujans gifts long before the rest of the world even though he is a lifelong atheist and Ramanujan believed that his understanding of equations expressed the view of his God. Theres a first-class supporting cast too but the real standout is Patel who is maturing impressively past his early days as a light romantic comedian.

This shamelessly corny expose on the evils of human trafficking plays like the love child of a Disney Channel kids drama and a public service announcement. Pretty young Nepali girl Lakshmi (Niyar Saikia) is invited to come to Calcutta with a glamorous female visitor promising her steady work. Instead she is deposited in the red light district where she becomes both the pathos-generating victim and the heroine of a childs fairy tale. Gillian Anderson and David Arquette drop by in bit parts as American do-gooders who wax sentimental about the plight of the abused as if the situation needed clarifying. While Saikia has real presence she like all the cast is obviously performing. In the Bollywood tradition there are repeated detours into group dancing not integral to the plot.

The Family Fang [?][?] out of four stars Rated R for some language. Theater Mall of America. After keeping us in laughs for ages Jason Bateman hopes to be a serious significant film director. This downbeat household drama is not without grace notes -- a minimalist visual style a coherent approach to presenting actors. Its also cursed with a tone of gloom and a contrived story bordering on absurdity. Bateman and Nicole Kidman play a novelist and his sister a celebrity actress. They grew up as featured players in performance art films secretly staged in public by their parents (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett) who became art world stars through stunts like fake bank robberies. But then they grew up and grew apart. The clan reconnects when an accident hospitalizes the writer then the parents vanish amid evidence suggesting they were kidnapped from a crime-ridden stretch of highway. Is the blood in their abandoned car proof that they were attacked or a grim make-believe gesture? There are hints of awkward comedy in the films surface structure but underneath lies a swamp of jumbled chronology and storytelling dissonance. Still Christopher Walken C.C.

(Starz Digital) There are a million ways for parents to screw up their kids. ""The Family Fang"" serves up a new one cutting-edge performance art. As the offspring of controversial artists Caleb and Camille Fang (Jason Butler Harner and Kathryn Hahn) siblings Annie and Baxter were drafted as children into playing parts in their parents elaborately staged public performances. The kids pretended to be bank robbers vampires in a photo studio and buskers with bad voices; in every case the response was a crowd of concerned and confused strangers. Dad filmed the chaotic scenes and voila Art was made. At least some people called it that. It was fun while it lasted but the now-grown Fang kids dont seem to have escaped the long shadow of their parents and their shared past. Annie (Nicole Kidman) is a once-promising film actress but her best days are behind her. Baxter (Jason Bateman who also directs) is a novelist with one good book to his name and years of writers block. Maybe all they need is some quality time at home with Mom and Dad. Maybe not. Now older Caleb and Camille (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett) get angry when Annie and Baxter refuse to take part in a new scheme so the parents decide to get away for the weekend. But when their abandoned car turns up at a rest area with Calebs blood on it police suspect foul play. Annie on the other hand is convinced that her parents are up to their usual tricks. Baxter doesnt know what to think. The Fangs eccentric pranks are enough to give the movie a fresh and amusing twist on the typical family drama about the psychic wounds of childhood and the lengths to which kids will go in seeking their parents approval. Theres a sense that Calebs offspring were little more than puppets to him; he even refers to them well into adulthood as ""Child A"" and ""Child B."" The extraordinary measures hell take for his art prompts a fascinating paranoia. Some audience members may wonder whether some of the happenstance of Annie and Baxters adult lives was actually orchestrated by their parents. Is it possible the artists are in cahoots with the police sheriff who seems so certain they are dead? Is Baxters former classmate really flirting with him or was she paid off? Its like ""The Truman Show"" except that we -- and those poor Fang siblings -- never know when the cameras are rolling. The movie also raises intriguing questions about art. When one of Calebs schemes goes awry he begins to throw a public tantrum. And when that happens these days you can bet someone will pull out a camera phone to start filming. ""You dont record me. I record you"" Caleb dismissively tells the man. ""This is art not some YouTube video."" Bateman does an effective job directing the movie which is based on a novel by Kevin Wilson (with a script by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire) smartly opting for understatement from his performers so that their characters eccentricities have something to play against. Much of the movie takes place inside the Fang family home where the scenes appear to have been shot through a rain cloud giving the movie a cold gray cast. The resulting heaviness verges on the lethargic at times. But the energy kicks up just in time for a finale that keeps the audience guessing. And thats not an easy trick to pull off. R.

Kidman who had husband Keith Urban by her side optioned the book that the quirky film is based on. (April 16) APJason Bateman directs and stars in a film about a family of avant-garde artists and the effect such a life has on the children.Nicole Kidman in ""The Family Fang.""(Photo Starz Digital)Story HighlightsCritics rating 4 out of 5 starsArt is life is art is life is art is ... you get the idea.For most people that revolving door is an interesting notion of devotion at least in theory. In actual practice it tends to play out only in moments like when you stay up two hours past your bedtime to watch the ""Game of Thrones"" episode you missed but DVRd.For Caleb and Camile Fang its different. For Caleb in particular life is a form of art. In ""The Family Fang"" director and star Jason Batemans compelling and weird film we see the dangers of that kind of devotion and the price it exacts on their children Annie and Baxter.By the way its a lot more entertaining than that sounds.Jason Bateman directs and stars in ""The Family Fang."" (Photo Starz Digital)Caleb (Christopher Walken) and Camile (Maryann Plunket) are what might be called experience artists whatever term might be used to describe something beyond performance artists. They have always incorporated their children (Nicole Kidman and Bateman) into their work without bothering to ask if they wanted to be.The film begins with one of their early pieces. Caleb (Jason Butler Harner plays the younger version) puts a camera in a fake security guard hat and orchestrates a bank robbery gone wrong -- pulled by a very young Baxter who accidentally ""shoots"" a bystander (his mother) while horrified customers watch. Later they manipulate a school production of ""Romeo and Juliet"" for maximum incest-tinged discomfort for their kids seeking audience reaction (never mind how the kids feel about it).In ""The Family Fang"" Camille (Kathryn Hahn) and Caleb (Jason Butler Harner) will never win an award for their parenting skills. (Photo Starz Digital)The art world is divided on whether these are pranks or substantive works (theres a funny bit where a couple of critics debate exactly that). But theres no doubt it is not the ideal environment in which to raise children. Thus the grown-up Annie is an alcoholic indie actress who is struggling with a directors request to do a topless scene. And Baxter is a writer unable to finish his third book. (Its the typical story First book well-received second book not so much so now hes looking for a comeback and blocked.)AZCENTRALThings To Do app Get the best in events dining and travel right on your deviceThey dont see their parents very often but when a magazine assignment goes hilariously awry and lands Baxter briefly in the hospital the four are reunited. Its clear both from their conversations and from jumping back and forth in time that Caleb has little use for his childrens expressions of art -- everything but what he and Camile do is fake he insists not worthy of being called art. This is not what a couple of self-doubting struggling children need to hear.And then Caleb and Camile go missing.Nicole Kidman and Jason Bateman play siblings in ""The Family Fang."" (Photo Starz Digital)The local cops think it could be the work of a serial killer but Annie smells a rat. An artistic rat. While Baxter is in no hurry to turn them up Annie turns junior detective (including a cork board noting that no investigation is complete without one).Is it a genuine tragedy? Or the ultimate art piece? And if it is the latter is any art worth what this would put a family through?MORE AZCENTRAL ON SOCIAL Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | PinterestBateman answers these questions as a director with care. (The script by David Lindsay-Abarie is based on the novel by Kevin Wilson.) He elicits good performances all the way around including from himself. Harner the least known of the bunch is especially good as the young Caleb. (Kathryn Hahn plays the younger Camile.)Bateman also is sly with the camera offering quick little shots here and there that inform our understanding of Baxter and Annies life. In ""Bad Words"" the last film he directed Bateman showed an unsurprising gift for comedy (he is an ""Arrested Development"" veteran after all). With ""The Family Fang"" he shows confidence with drama and perhaps more impressively with weirdness never letting things get odd just for the sake of it. He wisely doesnt force the issue. This bunch is plenty weird on its own.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

Movie review of ""The Family Fang"" Nicole Kidman Jason Bateman and Christopher Walken star in this absorbing beyond-eccentric-family drama. Rating 3.5 stars out of 4. Share story By John HartlSpecial to The Seattle Times With its opening line ""Imagine youre dead"" ""The Family Fang"" instantly invites its soon-to-be-captive audience on an absorbing provocative slightly fantastic path thats like few others. On one level its the ultimate dysfunctional-family drama dominated by Christopher Walken and Maryanne Plunketts beyond-eccentric turns as Caleb and Camille Fang. The aging couples devotion to performance art both alienates and fascinates their children Annie (Nicole Kidman) and Baxter (Jason Bateman) who think they might be becoming their parents latest targets. Or so it seems. But are they really the victims in the couples mind games or are they involved in a real crime drama that happens to involve police DNA a serial killer avant-garde projects repressed memories and a virginal rock band? Movie Review 1/2   The Family Fang with Nicole Kidman Jason Bateman Christopher Walken Maryanne Plunkett. Directed by Bateman from a screenplay by David Lindsay-Abaire based on a novel by Kevin Wilson. 105 minutes. Rated R for some language. Sundance Cinemas (21+). Critics of the Fangs object that their elaborate stagings of dramatic events (like say a disastrous and eerily tear-jerking bank robbery) amount to nothing more than ""hollow pranks."" Others regard the couple and their work as prophetic and genuine. Hardly anyone is on the fence about the Fangs. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Walken and Plunkett are always convincing as a couple who have been through plenty of art-fringe battles. Bateman has been on the edge of a breakthrough making especially engaging impressions in ""Juno"" and ""Arrested Development"" but this may be his first behind-the-cameras knockout.

Earnest good-looking and gifted with both a dramatic range and a talent for nuance he rarely shows in the commercial junk he usually peddles Jason Bateman directed and stars in The Family Fang a dysfunctional family epic that is much better than the title suggests. As a director it towers above his debut effort 2013s Bad Words and as an actor god knows its about a 150 percent improvement over his impoverished co-starring effort with Melissa McCarthy in the ghastly brain-dead Identity Thief. This ones a keeper. THE FAMILY FANG  (3/4 stars) Written by David Lindsay-Abaire Directed by Jason Bateman Starring Jason Bateman Nicole Kidman and Kathryn Hahn Running time 105 min. Adapted from Kevin Wilsons 2011 novel by the distinguished playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (2007 Pulitzer Prize for Rabbit Hole) this is a heartbreaking comedy drama about two adult unmarried and unfocused siblings taking stock of their messed-up lives after being raised by a pair of loopy self-serving con artists who drafted their children against their will used and exploited them without offering them a choice and left them to cope with the consequences of a weird irresponsible childhood without guidance protection or hope for a sane future. Baxter (Jason Bateman) and Annie (Nicole Kidman) have spent their lives in survival mode. Shes an actress and recovering alcoholic reduced to topless scenes in B flicks; hes a failed novelist with writers block. After being shot in the head by a cannon firing a potato and left with a perforated eardrum Baxter is released from the hospital into the terrifying custody of the parents hes been trying to avoid and Annie rushes to a dreaded family reunion to save him. In flashbacks we learn why. Caleb and Camille Fang (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett) were experimental avant-garde ""artists"" who recruited their kids to stage fake bank robberies and improvise public scenes to incite riots and summon the cops risking their lives in the process. Everything is regarded as ""material"" and anything goes. Now the parents go away for a weekend and their wrecked car is found in a highway rest stop covered with blood. Annie heads for the vodka bottle. Baxter reaches for the Percodan. Have the Fangs really been abducted in an act of foul play? Or is their disappearance part of a monster con to create their defining and most provocative work even if it means sacrificing their children to do it? Its hard to describe what happens next but The Family Fang is far from over. Its called leaping into life--without a net. Theres nothing predictable about any of the angles and Mr. Abaires script reveals a surprise around every corner. The message is that if youre in control the chaos in life will happen around you not to you. The performances are kinetic and fascinating. Nicole Kidman is fetching in bare feet plaid shirts and brown hair as she struggles to untangle the Fang family dynamic. Mr. Batemans charisma is genuine and hes a good director too. When The Family Fang was first unveiled at last years Toronto International Film Festival he told the Globe and Mail he wants his next film to be more overtly commercial. Hes developing projects that are less complex with ""more popcorn elements and are a bit more simplistic."" Sigh. Exit the hope for better movies with nuance subtext and tonal complications and cue the return of Melissa McCarthy.

Judging by his first two efforts as a director that same pairing translates to his filmmaking sensibilities. His 2013 ""Bad Words"" was an uneven but entertainingly vulgar riff on spelling bees in which Bateman starred as a former champ eager to rig a competition in his adult life. With his follow-up ""The Family Fang"" Bateman tackles a more subtle blend of comedy and drama with mixed results but plenty of tonal intrigue. His quest to become a serious filmmaker continues to show potential. Focused on a family of performance artists whose bizarre pranks taint their offsprings adult lives ""Family Fang"" maintains an effective degree of intellectual curiosity about the creative process. Theres a sincerity to even its trickier plot twists not unlike the formula often found at the heart of movies co-directed by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (""I Love You Phillip Morris"" ""Crazy Stupid Love"" ""Focus"" and the noble failure ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot""). Their penchant for obsessive characters driven by a blend of suave maneuvering and sincere desire is a reasonable template for Batemans studied approach and thats not a bad place to start. In ""The Family Fang"" Kevin Wilsons 2011 novel provides the template for his own screenplay which focuses on the legacy of parents Caleb and Camille Fang (played in flashbacks by Jason Butler Harner and Kathryn Hahn then later by Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett). Their professional reputation stems from ""improvised public events"" in which the pair shock unsuspecting onlookers with bizarre fictional dramas in public places. In the early days of their routine these antics often include their children -- a wonderfully mysterious opening bit finds the quartet staging a mock bank robbery involving lollypops and baffling the room -- but in their later years the schtick has lost its groove. However by recording their routines the Fangs create a formal process for scrutinizing their actions which allows them to gain traction in the art world. The fame has a troubling long-term impact on the youngest members of the Fang brood who enter their adult lives still haunted by the past. Baxter (Bateman) is a neurotic writer who would rather waste his days away in the wilderness than deal with his past; his sister Annie (Nicole Kidman) has become a famous actress stuck with less than satisfying roles. A sudden accident forces the pair to reconvene at their parents house where years of resentment bubble to the surface. Its at this point that ""Family Fang"" starts to sag into a more routine family drama in which the grown children constantly scowl and shake their heads at their overbearing parents who remain doggedly committed to their old ways. It just happens that these old ways are somewhat unorthodox which leads to a Machiavellian scheme during the final hour in which the elder Fangs attempt to get their groove back -- while Baxter and Annie are thrust into a Mulder/Scully dynamic picking up the irreverent clues their parents left behind. The offbeat dynamic of the Fang family holds less appeal than the way Bateman frames it around a keen satire of the creative obsession. Early on a fake documentary about the Fangs reputation features a hilarious pair of feuding art critics one of whom describes the Fangs as ""deeply serious class clowns"" asking questions about the limitations on society; his opponent relies ""just because you attach a statement to it doesnt make it art."" While their neurotic feud has the tongue-in-cheek intellectualism worthy of Woody Allen its just as effective at setting the stage for the degree to which the Fangs commitment to their process crosses moral lines. Unfortunately Bateman never quite pulls these provocative questions together into a satisfying whole. As an actor he holds his own opposite Kidman who brings an anxious driven quality to the character unlike anything shes done in years. Their parents on the other hand hail from the quirkier realm of indie dramedy cliches Plunketts bland maternal performance seems out of sync with her scheming character while Walken is just Walken with the usual idiosyncratic cadences he tends to carry with him. This same disconnect often hobbles the narrative which hovers on the edge of pitch-black comedy before shifting into more obvious sentimental territory as Baxter confronts his anxieties over being a writer and Annies own issues just kind of settle on their own. But Batemans visible attempts to elevate the story -- elegant camerawork Carter Burwells captivating score -- give ""The Family Fang"" a compelling atmosphere that makes it difficult to categorize the events in play. Is this a movie designed to mess with your head or about the ethical gray zone of doing just that? Ambiguity is its best weapon even if its wielded a tad too bluntly to succeed all the way. At one point Kidmans character expresses a frustration over ""the stupid things an actor does when theyre too afraid to act"" and it would be easy to read into that statement as Bateman speaking through his own material. ""The Family Fang"" is hardly that. Striving to make deep statements about life art and family bonds it doesnt quite get there but the effort is enough to leave a mark. Like the Fangs own strange craft the movies own shortcomings speak to its themes. Grade B ""The Family Fang"" opens in New York on Friday followed by a nationwide and VOD release on May 6.

Starz Digital/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The maddening ties that bind parents and children are the subject of ""The Family Fang"" a mostly successful adaptation of the 2011 Kevin Wilson novel directed by Jason Bateman and scripted by the playwright David Lindsay-Abaire. Bateman also costars with Nicole Kidman as damaged siblings Baxter and Annie whose bohemian parents corralled them as children into taking part in performance art pieces like a sabotaged beauty pageant and a bank robbery.The parents in the present-day scenes are played by Maryann Plunkett and Christopher Walken who is at his best as the lethally oddball Caleb. The movie captures so well the push-pull of family dysfunction that after a while even the Fangs extreme eccentricities seem routine. And thats the point The filmmakers are trying to demonstrate that no matter what we think our family dynamic may be were all on the same strange spectrum. Bateman is extraordinarily good as the hurt wary Baxter a struggling novelist while Kidman playing an actress past her prime makes a convincing sibling. Her performance is less freeze-dried than usual. The film becomes overly inspirational and it does go on a bit - whenever you think its about to end it slides into another scene - but it successfully manages the difficult transition from loopy to tragic to uplifting.

More News The Wild Unlikely Return of Arrested Development Nicole Kidman Lust and Trust Jason Bateman on the Bright Future of Arrested Development All Stories >> Related 50 Most Anticipated Movies of 2016 From superhero movies and serious dramas to a new Star Wars movie the years must-sees Annie (Kidman) is an actress in a career slump. Baxter (Bateman) is a stalled author. Miraculously this sister and brother find their way into our minds and hearts. Thats because playwright David Lindsay-Abaire (Rabbit Hole) has adapted Kevin Wilsons novel into something deeper than another trip to dysfunction junction. And because Bateman back in the directors chair after a strong 2014 feature debut with Bad Words proves he has an affinity for the process especially for actors. Kidman is in peak form. And Bateman nails every comic and dramatic nuance finding Baxters bruised heart and inner strength. The Family Fang feels lived in instead of constructed. It sneaks up on you. It helps of course to have the bracingly bizarre Christopher Walken play Daddy Fang a wicked charmer named Caleb who literally uses his children as props to prop up his shaky identity as an artist. Other parents do the same thing but metaphorically. Caleb and his wife Camille (a stellar Maryann Plunkett) go right at it. In flashbacks we watch younger versions of Caleb and Camille played by Jason Butler Harner and Kathryn Hahn consistently place art over their children. In the present Annie and Baxter come together when their parents go missing. Annie thinks theyre faking it for publicity much needed since their careers faltered when Annie and Baxter left the act. Baxter resists - he wants to believe even his unorthodox parents wouldnt be hurtful enough to convince their kids and the world that theyre dead. As Annie and Baxter play detective in a case involving their own lives The Family Fang emerges as a comedy with disturbing undercurrents. Kidman and Bateman make a potent team in a provocative film that questions the limits of art in a world that forgets to be human. The result is funny touching and vital.

Courtesy of Starz Digital hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Starz Digital Nicole Kidman and Jason Bateman in The Family Fang. Courtesy of Starz Digital The premise and poster of The Family Fang promise a dynasty of twee eccentrics with maladjusted children like the Tenenbaums or the Bluths of Arrested Development. But though the Fangs share the latters Jason Bateman here directing as well as once more playing the put-upon son this is a different failed family and they strike a different tone onscreen one more principled and intimate than mannered or mocking. Theyre a clan of performance artists whose public spectacles puncture the very idea of how families are supposed to behave now reckoning with the long-term consequences of such a life-consuming craft. In the 1970s the parents Caleb and Camille made their two children often-unwitting players in their prankish pieces instructing their son to fake a bank robbery manipulating a school production of Romeo and Juliet so the siblings would be forced to kiss onstage. Critics are divided on the artistic merits of such stunts but everyone seems to agree that Caleb and Camilles work lost its pizzazz once ""Child A"" and ""Child B"" grew up and flew the coop. Christopher Walken makes a brilliantly nasty patriarch a bully who mocks and degrades all other forms of art as fake -- including the acting and writing his grown-up children have done. He spouts Caleb Fangs ideas with such conviction such pomposity that its easy to picture this man drum-majoring his family all these years and also easy to picture them desperate to drift away from him. This is what Annie (Nicole Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) have done the former becoming an alcoholic Hollywood star the latter a struggling novelist and magazine writer who winds up back home after an on-assignment injury. But Fang mother Camille (played by Maryann Plunkett with more of a sly folk-artists charm) has remained loyal even though she secretly paints little country scenes on the side stashing them away lest Caleb catch her aesthetic betrayal to his cause. A Fang reunion in their sprawling upstate New York home is quickly followed by the sudden disappearance of the parents and the discovery of evidence pointing to a serial killers handiwork. Annie is too smart to fall for that trick and starts piecing together any shred of evidence that they faked the whole thing. Were too smart to fall for it too and yet the mystery of the Fang parents becomes oddly engrossing or at least more so than the soul-searching it prompts in the children. Kidmans character succumbs to an implausible belief that she can somehow change her parents essential natures until theyre all a normal family instead of a gallery piece. The mania she attaches to this motivation (complete with bulletin boards tracking the case) is too simple of an approach to the story. But Kidman does sell her chemistry with Bateman a fraternal spark that comes with a taboo edge thanks to that Romeo and Juliet incident. This is Batemans second directorial feature after the R-rated spelling-bee comedy Bad Words -- a film that seemed to share Papa Fangs desire for shock and awe. For the first time he proves himself capable of overseeing authentic human drama and has moments here of a true filmmakers eye particularly in the flashback sequences depicting the ""pieces"" which are shot with lush colors and prompt a great sense of danger and uncertainty. ""How far will they go with this?"" we wonder and cringe every time we get our answer. A crackling scene in the present day has the Fang parents trying to rebel against corporate fast food by handing out bogus coupons only to be foiled by the human error of a strangers kindness. This sequences perfect escalation is how we learn that underneath all the Fangs professed desire to incorporate the public into their art is a deep contempt for that same public a contempt even for life unscripted. Based on the 2011 novel by Kevin Wilson The Family Fang sings with great ideas about the ways all families lie to their children and what it means to live with people you can never take seriously (being constantly addressed with the performative monikers ""Child A"" and ""Child B"" has to take its toll eventually). But the film suffers from a similar fate to many movies about artists in order to make sure the audience gets what these people are about everyone talks too much about the themes at the heart of their work instead of letting the work speak for itself. The overly chatty script by David Lindsay-Abaire (a Pulitzer Prize winner for his play Rabbit Hole) has difficulty carrying its most promising themes to a satisfying payoff and a third-act reveal is riddled with plot holes. Carter Burwells gripping ominous score suggests an untapped mystery and darkness to the material. But though the Fangs themselves may not think much of their audience their movie is still warmly inviting because their peculiar frustrations become concrete and universal. That may not be a victory for Calebs brand of art but it is a minor one for filmmaking.

Photo Starz Digital MOVIE REVIEW The family fang Running time 105 minutes. Rated R (profanity). ""The Family Fang"" are a couple of performance artists (and their semi-willing children) whose lifes work is to stage the live equivalent of prank phone calls. They stage a wacky bank robbery that leads to a pretend fatal shooting for instance and a school version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" in which a brother and sister lock lips onstage. In short the artists (Christopher Walken Maryann Plunkett) are bozo bohos with a single trite idea E patez les bourgeoisie Inform Middle America how sterile its culture is one more time. The pairs adult children (Jason Bateman Nicole Kidman) each of them left empty and forlorn by their childhoods ache for more conventional parents even as Mom and Dad stage their boldest ""piece"" yet -- they pretend to be kidnapped. Or maybe they really were abducted at a location that has experienced a series of similar crimes. The film -- directed with a wounded somberness by Bateman -- has an admirable ability to debate itself considering the senior Fangs both as bold avant-gardists and abusive parents. Yet merely ""playing with concepts"" doesnt quite add up to a film and ""The Family Fang"" adapted from Kevin Wilsons novel feels like an extended therapy session.

Share Tweet Its easy to see why Jason Bateman and Nicole Kidman would be attracted to an adaptation of Kevin Wilsons novel The Family Fang. The movie doesnt emphasize the parallels between its characters and the stars playing them but theyre present nonetheless. The Fang siblings Baxter (Bateman) and Annie (Kidman) were raised by their performance artist parents and always included in their pieces before growing up to become a novelist and an actress respectively. This means that Bateman (who also directed the film) is playing a former child performer while Kidman is playing a celebrated screen performer now entering middle age. Could she relate to an early moment of Annies latest director berating her into doing an ""edgy"" nude scene? For Batemans part there are also faint echoes in what the movie leaves out His character was called Buster in the novel. Perhaps he found it prudent to avoid sharing a name with his fiction sibling from his best-loved dysfunctional family narrative especially when the Fangs elaborate performance art already has a hint of J. Walter Weatherman. (""Always leave a note"")Outside of a few flashbacks to their younger years the Fang parents are played by Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett. Though he doesnt look or act much like his youthful counterpart Walken is still convincing as the type of artist (somewhere between performance and con) who refuses to give up his tricks as he ages out of them. Even when freelancing journalist Baxter winds up hospitalized and released into his parents custody against his will and Annie arrives to retrieve him their parents insist on enlisting them for another performance art piece. The kids refuse and shortly after their elaborate prank involving fake coupons falls flat the Fang parents disappear. The police suspect accidental death; the remaining Fangs are less sure that mom and dad are really gone for good.Its at this point that The Family Fang switches from an adult-kids-returning-home dramedy to a sort of familial mystery. Its a great hook that the movie manages to take almost half of its running time to reach often by dragging individual scenes out without developing or deepening them. The characters spend a fair amount of time discussing the significance of the films flashbacks with clipped obligation making shorthand what a novel would probably have time to really explore while still not cutting to the chase. This is all the more surprising given that the script is by playwright David Lindsay-Abaire whose self-adapted screenplay for Rabbit Hole gave Kidman one of her best roles.Walkens Caleb Fang has a mantra of sorts ""If youre in control the chaos will happen around you not to you."" Bateman does maintain a certain directorial control and true to Calebs words The Family Fang sometimes seems to be happening around him--in the vicinity of two good performances from Bateman and Kidman rather than in concert with them. Batemans instincts for restraint are probably spot-on in theory. The Family Fang with its bizarre art projects and family melancholy could easily become a quirk pageant. But the movie downplays its whimsicality so thoroughly that the real intrigue--the mystery of what has or hasnt happened to the Fang parents--gets pushed off practically out of the movie. Its not that the mystery isnt resolved so much that the movie doesnt seem all that concerned with its resolution or its set-up or a sense of discovery in general.Whats left is those two strong performances. Bateman is especially funny in the sequence that lands Baxter in the hospital and Kidman never resorts to shallow-actress cliches when indicating how a life in different kinds of spotlights may have frayed at Annies nerves. They both deserve a riskier weirder less flat movie. Bateman has made the kind of adaptation that unintentionally advertises its source material as in All of this must have worked so much better on the page.

A mixed-up family dramedy gives audiences something to chew on. Director Jason Bateman. (145). R Language alcohol abuse. At the Angelika. ""The Family Fang"" has a nasty little bite to it -- and thank heavens for that. Most movies about offbeat kids and oddball parents try too hard to put the fun in dysfunction. Every social disaster ends with a happy spin. Every scowling villain blossoms into a little miss sunshine by the end. The titular family in this film though nurses its grudges like old scotch. CHRISTOPHER WALKEN IS OUTSTANDING IN ONE MORE TIME Theres plenty of gripes to go around too. Caleb and Camille Fang are wingnut  performance artists whose pieces are elaborate practical jokes -- public scenes pranks embarrassments. For years their kids Annie and Baxter were unwilling participants. Except their kids are adults now sort of -- Annie a drunken actress Baxter a failed novelist. And theyve come home for one last awkward visit. And -- whether they want to participate or not -- maybe one last performance. Film is supposed to be a collaborative effort and ""The Family Fang"" has two equal partners in stars Nicole Kidman and Jason Bateman. She bought the novel and brought on playwright David Lindsay-Abaire to adapt it; Bateman signed on her co-lead and director. Tooth and Consequences Jason Bateman as Baxter Fang and Nicole Kidman as Annie Fang in ""The Family Fang."" (Alison Rosa) Working together theyve kept the storys smart dark tone while adding imaginative new touches -- flashbacks to the Fangs ""pieces"" and bits of an abandoned documentary. They also do some of their best acting in years. Kidman loses the frozen-face iciness thats stalled a lot of her recent roles. And Bateman -- who has his own history as a manipulated teen performer -- brings a palpable pain to his character. But ""The Family Fang"" has humor too. And it has a great charming monster in Christopher Walkens Caleb Fang. Unlike his wife -- played by a marvelous Maryann Plunkett -- hes never had any question about what comes first Art or family. Its art of course. Whaddaya nuts? ""The Family Fang"" isnt as mysterious as it wants to be and sometimes it gets a little claustrophobic (once the movie gets to the Fangs upstate New York house it hardly leaves). But its got a refreshingly sharp tone and its story of roles and responsibilities and guilt and duty makes some comedic and very cutting points. And that gives the Fangs some bite.

Starz Digital Media A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - You know that primly annoyed nice-ish guy Jason Bateman always plays? The straight arrow whose barely contained disgust suggests that universal American feeling that its everyone but you who is the selfish idiot? If youve ever suspected that the real Bateman was himself swallowing back some annoyance at the stupidity of projects like Identity Thief heres the best evidence yet. His second feature The Family Fang is a tense and involving dysfunction indie that starts as dark comedy but later stretches into mystery melodrama and arts criticism.That doesnt mean it starts promisingly. The story adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire from Kevin Wilsons novel has Bateman and Nicole Kidman moping through the kind of adult lives real people dream of Hes a novelist and shes a screen actress. Like all siblings in funny-sad indie things they must band together to deal with their parents and like most intergenerational comedies since Family Ties its the kids who are more conservative than their boomer parents. The Fangs were roving performance artists staging and filming confrontational happenings at banks and parks and -- occasionally -- in their own kids lives. (Christopher Walken and Maryann Plunkett play the parents in the present-day scenes sometimes getting to hold forth at length about the nature of art with Jason Butler Harner and Kathryn Hahn taking over in honey-filtered flashbacks.)Film DetailsCritics Pick The Family Fang RatingR GenreDrama Running Time105 min. More Info Trailer Like street preachers the Fangs impressed their children into their public troublemaking the father referring to them in cold materials-minded shorthand as Child A and Child B. As adults the kids turn apostate refusing to participate in a disturbance at an amusement park -- and even quoting back to their father the reviews of his most recent work. He in turn is dismissive of their films and books though he appreciates Kidmans characters nude appearance in a tabloid ""Its about time you started playing with celebrity and the idea of the female form as a viewed object"" he proclaims. So the parents favor conceptual art and the kids are just trying to make a living crafting un-terrible entertainment. Wilsons novel and Batemans film dont just showcase this rift -- they mine gold from it.The Family Fang deepens as it takes on some pulpier elements. Forty-five minutes in a terrible fate seems to befall the parents and its left to the adult children to work out whether it was a random tragedy or their biggest staged work yet. The story has the spine of a mystery but its chief discoveries arent really the clues that the siblings pick up in their parents old CDs and VHS tapes. Theyre also not the cheap epiphanies you might expect. Instead the lessons are about facing disappointment and then moving on -- but holding close to the people from the past who have held to you. Its a welcome balance to every inspirational film about artists that has insisted being a horrible person is OK just so long as the art is significant.Bateman is nimble in handling a tricky mix of flashbacks and pranks genres and tones. As you might expect from such a gifted ensemble performer hes also an actors director. In montage he sometimes depends upon music to make us feel things while in his best scenes you might forget hes making choices Everything seems driven by his cast especially Kidman who fills out Batemans deceptively loose long takes with surprising beats and richly textured feeling. Her Annie is a minor star and a little embarrassed even to be that. A hardness in her eyes makes clear shes put up with too much already and might not continue for long. Its been too many years since Kidmans been free to be a person onscreen someone specific and layered whose responses seem to spring not from the script but from the lived moments were watching.As an actor Bateman seems at last to have sprung from his type. His strong turn as a thriller creep in The Gift might have been an interrogation of the usual Bateman square -- his prim everydudes have always disguised their cruel and obsessive streaks with optimism. Here hes freed from the usual cycle of high hopes and comic frustration instead sketching a subtle effective portrait of a survivor. This guys too smart to enable the lunacy of the family hes stuck with and thats something of a revelation A Jason Bateman character declining to get roped into public humiliation is something like Jack Benny managing to make a purchase without incident. Its even a little moving. If he can so persuasively break from his patterns maybe the rest of us can too.

Movies about families (especially famous ones) run the risk of being obnoxious. Its a fine line between precocious and precious best walked by Wes Anderson and his 2001 masterpiece The Royal Tenenbaums in which we watch a familys glory days curdle into unfulfilled promise. The Fangs of actor Jason Batemans ambitious second directorial effort The Family Fang are no less huggable but his movie--loosely adapted from Kevin Wilsons 2011 novel--is more downbeat raw and grown-up than Andersons hyperstylized one. The four main characters who we follow across golden-hued 70s and 80s flashbacks and grayish arguments in the present are weird ones to anchor a movie--but go with it. Siblings Annie (Nicole Kidman more relaxed than shes been in years) and Baxter (Bateman) once were ""Child A"" and ""Child B"" in their parents performance-art videos co-conspirators in bloody bank robbings and public stunts. Now Annies a failing Hollywood bad girl whos asked to take her top off while Baxter is an uneven novelist with only a few dollars to rub together. An accident reunites them at the hospital with their parents and when we meet crazy-haired Caleb (Christopher Walken heartbreaking and direct for a change) and Camille (Maryann Plunkett) who greet their bandage-wrapped son with fake black eyes of their own we quickly know them for the pranksters they are. But any notion that the band is getting back together is punctured by sour feelings and when the parents disappear in a rest-stop ""abduction"" (that police are taking seriously) you wonder if its real or just another performance this time motivated by disappointment in their children. The Family Fang goes deep into dysfunction but even more impressively it smuggles in the daredevilish art theories of the late Chris Burden and his ilk At one point Walken abruptly smashes a glass and calls it art. Its one of the most forceful bits of acting hes done. Whether Caleb is persuasive (and the film includes plenty of counterarguments) is another story entirely one thats intelligent and laced with consequence.

We need more movies about dysfunctional families like we need more movies about the tortured inner lives of artists which is all the more reason to be unexpectedly grateful for ""The Family Fang"" a sharply drawn portrait of a dysfunctional tortured artistic family that speaks affectingly to the troubled legacy that all parents inevitably bequeath to their children. Following his raucous and foul-mouthed directorial debut ""Bad Words"" Jason Bateman shows marked progress and deepening maturity as a filmmaker with this cleverly structured but never arch or mechanical adaptation of Kevin Wilsons 2011 comic novel with Bateman and Nicole Kidman nicely inhabiting one of the more tender and persuasive brother-sister relationships in recent movie memory. With its rich vein of melancholy and intricate but entirely accessible narrative layers ""Fang"" will require shrewd distributor positioning to sink its teeth into the arthouse market; solid critical response and cast names should help. By dint of its plot description alone ""The Family Fang"" superficially recalls any number of past pictures about the toll of a monstrous father figure on his talented and sensitive children including Wes Andersons ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and Noah Baumbachs ""The Squid and the Whale."" Although more modest in its aims and achievements than those earlier touchstones David Lindsay-Abaires screenplay (his strongest big-screen effort since ""Rabbit Hole"" an earlier Kidman collaboration) boasts a fluid easily enveloping style that takes a wisely understated approach to a premise that could otherwise have seemed brazenly artificial. Centering around a domestic upbringing that would seem extreme and out-there by even the loosest of parenting standards the picture devotes itself to dramatizing its protagonists unique childhood in grounded and believable fashion. Well into adulthood but pointedly lacking any kids or long-term relationships of their own Annie (Kidman) and Baxter (Bateman) are still trying to process the damage wrought by their parents a pair of celebrated New York performance artists named Caleb (Christopher Walken) and Camille Fang (Maryann Plunket) who have mastered a brand of socially deviant flash-mob-style public fakeout. We see many examples of their past work firsthand (in golden-hued re-creations and old video clips) including an early sequence of a phony bank robbery in which young Baxter plays stick-em-up with a teller father Caleb masquerades as a security guard and mom Camille is the innocent bystander who gets gunned down oozing candy blood while daughter Annie howls in agony though shes really trying not to laugh. (The younger versions of Caleb and Camille are played by Jason Butler Harner and Kathryn Hahn.) What parents would do such a thing? The kind who see child rearing as just another way to realize their artistic ambitions to the fullest -- and indeed Caleb and Camille achieved the height of their recognition by the art world when they got their children in on the act (as discussed in a clip of two Artforum types played by Scott Shepherd and Steve Witting). And clearly the kids either inherited or absorbed their parents creative impulses Annie is now a well-known film actress though shes feeling restless and uncertain about the direction of her career while Baxter has been trying to finish writing his third novel for the past two years. When a freelance magazine assignment goes awry and unexpectedly lands Baxter in the hospital (in a very funny energetically cut sequence) the stage is set for an unplanned family reunion and brother and sister brace themselves -- and lean heavily on each other -- in expectation of the worst. While this all may sound on paper like just another dispatch from the ninth circle of indie-quirkfest hell ""The Family Fang"" deepens and darkens as Caleb Camille Annie and Baxter come back together at the old homestead in upstate New York -- a wonderfully lived-in repository of old memories and countless discarded art projects (courtesy of Beth Mickles production design) and filmed in shadowy richly muted colors by d.p. Ken Seng. Bateman and Lindsay-Abaire modulate the tension carefully and with a merciful avoidance of histrionics though after an uncomfortable dinner and several more awkward conversations its plain to see that Dad is the monster of the group whether hes dismissing Annies career as basically ""crap movies and a tampon commercial"" or knocking down Baxters attempt to relate to his father as a fellow artist ""Dont talk about things you know nothing about."" When Mom and Dad suddenly go missing under troubling circumstances Annie is convinced that its merely the latest manipulative ruse devised by two people well versed in the art of deception. But Baxter isnt so sure and so brother and sister begin an investigation into the mystery of not just where their parents may have gone but also who they are how much they really care about their children and whether the present state of their career -- which declined after Annie and Baxter opted to withdraw permanently -- might have driven them into hiding. All this is conveyed not merely through plot and dialogue but through a highly cinematic weave of sound and image Set to a delicate score by Carter Burwell (already having quite a year with ""Carol"" and ""Anomalisa"") the films time-shuffling structure comes to mirror the very act of scanning ones family history searching for memories that will present our loved ones in the best or even worst possible light. Working with editor Robert Franzen Bateman ingeniously sprinkles clips of those old performance-art pieces (a mix of 8mm and 16mm formats) throughout the movie and they prove wonderfully illuminating -- not only holding clues to future narrative developments but also giving us a frequently hilarious sometimes piercingly sad glimpse of what it must have been like to grow up with these particular parents. As intensely specific as these circumstances may be however the film rarely feels inward-looking or self-involved. The message it has to impart (""They f-k you up your mom and dad"") is a universal one. Even those of us who werent raised by socially deviant avant-gardists may come away from ""The Family Fang"" with a renewed appreciation that we are all to some extent at the mercy of those who brought us into the world -- fully formed adults who had dreams and desires of their own well before children entered the picture. Admirers of the Bateman oeuvre will pick up on more than a few echoes of ""Arrested Development"" with its even more acerbic portrait of parents and siblings waging open war; the episodes in which the Bluth children are ambushed by one-armed stuntman J. Walter Weatherman come particularly to mind. (The ""Arrested Development"" connection may even explain why the name of Batemans character has been changed from Buster to Baxter.) Yet its a measure of Batemans skill in front of and behind the camera that his performance here betrays nary a shred of actorly indulgence operating instead in a subdued register that achieves quietly aching moments in the final stretch. He meshes beautifully with Kidman who does some of her earthiest most unaffected work in some time as a woman whose resentment of her parents is matched only by her protectiveness toward her little brother. (Its a bit harder to buy Kidman as a B-list actress who has qualms about doing nudity a plot point thats dispensed with early on.) Together the two leads achieve a wholly convincing sibling rapport that will strike a chord with anyone whos ever seen their brother or sister as not just a friend but an ally. The too-little-seen Plunkett is superb as a wife and mother who for all their shared commitment to their art has had to suppress or hide her own gifts for the sake of her husbands happiness. To no ones surprise Walken steals scenes right and left as an eccentric overbearing father whose every word and gesture makes clear that he sees people as secondary to performance and that his own preferred style of live unpredictable in-the-moment performance art is the only form of creative expression still worth a damn in the era of YouTube. Everything else for him is ""garbage"" which makes it rather fitting that his own movie winds up proving him wrong.

Mollie key says March 23 2016 at 1237 am Great job Reply Judy Raddue (SilvestriWoman) says September 14 2015 at 833 pm Much of the credit must go to Nicole Kidman who bought the rights to the book for her production company (Blossom) and immediately got the writer of Rabbit Hole - David Lindsay-Abaire - to sign on of the screenplay. Im thrilled to see Rabbit Hole - which I believe was under-appreciated and in which Kidman gave one of her finest performance - not be a fluke. Kidman may prove a force to be reckoned with as a producer. Reply Ellen Ginsburg says September 14 2015 at 817 pm Robert Frazens name is misspelled in the body of this review. Please try and correct it - it would be a shame for Robert to not be recognized for this achievement. Reply ian says September 14 2015 at 804 pm Cant wait for this.

TWITTER Nicole Kidman stars alongside director Jason Bateman in this adaptation of Kevin Wilsons novel about a family of performance artists drawn into a murder mystery. Theres an illuminating moment late in Jason Batemans richly captivating film of The Family Fang when the unorthodox patriarch played with a sardonic glint by Christopher Walken says to his adult offspring ""You think we damaged you? So what Thats what parents do."" Thats close enough to a key to this smart tart adaptation of Kevin Wilsons best-selling 2011 debut novel which thumbs its nose at the cliches of the over-trafficked dysfunctional family genre to dissect the sometimes lifelong quest of children to understand their parents in ways that are funny and bittersweet poignant and often bracingly dark. The inherent interiority of prose can make works about eccentric clans quite a tricky prospect for screen transfer. Just ask Ryan Murphy and the handful of people who recall his grating 2006 take on Augusten Burroughs Running With Scissors. But every choice here feels right starting with getting playwright David Lindsay-Abaire on board as screenwriter. Before his Pulitzer-winning breakthrough drama about grief Rabbit Hole (the film of which starred Nicole Kidman who first optioned this material) Lindsay-Abaire made his name in the theater with sweetly subversive comedies about misfit characters trying to get a handle on their place in an absurd universe. That canvas along with his more sober later works comes into play in this beautiful adaptation. His script navigates with assurance the supple shifts from antic humor to uneasy family conflict and into a possible murder mystery before emerging out the other side as a layered and affecting consideration of parent-child relationships. See more A THR Portfolio Sandra Bullock Eddie Redmayne and More Stars of the Toronto Film Festival In addition to marking a leap in maturity from Batemans modest first outing as director Bad Words the new movie also provides him with a wonderful acting vehicle. The give-and-take dynamic and intimate sibling shorthand between his character Baxter Fang and his sister Annie played by Kidman feels unerringly real suggesting a whole history that spans childhood adventures through adult disenchantment. After a well-received first novel and a ""divisive"" follow-up Baxter is stuck on a third book thats two years overdue. Annie has gotten her drinking and impulsive behavior more or less under control but her career as a screen actress is sputtering as the good roles stop coming. Baxter takes an assignment for a mens magazine to write about war veterans in upstate New York (some locations have been changed from the book) shooting supercharged potato guns for recreational therapy. But his enthusiastic embrace of their sport ends with him getting shot in the head; to his horror his parents are contacted to take charge of his convalescence. Annie is also prompted to pause and take stock after her latest unwelcome tabloid exposure and an Esquire profile during which she reveals too much and sleeps with the reporter (an amusing Danny Burstein). Baxter convinces her that if he can face time with their parents she can too. Their return home brings back memories of the 1970s when they were Child A and Child B in elaborate spontaneous New York performance pieces masterminded by their parents Caleb (Walken) and Camille (Maryann Plunkett). In a hilarious take on the contemporary art world these stunts are dismissed as pranks by the Fangs detractors and hailed as acts of Dadaist genius by their admirers. Baxter prefers to leave those sometimes confusing experiences archived in the past while Annie remains obsessed with them poring over old video recordings. See more Can Netflix and Amazon Rescue a Weak TIFF Market? Those video and film clips seen throughout are blasts of anarchic mischief with Jason Butler Harner and Kathryn Hahn as the younger Fang parents. We witness a bank lollipop robbery a sabotaged beauty pageant a human firework and a beach burial. In one piece loaded with significance the young Annie (Mackenzie Smith) and Baxter (Jack McCarthy) perform a tuneless song she wrote called ""Kill All Parents"" demonstrating a stunning absence of musicianship. When their incognito parents start heckling from the crowd in Central Park a fight breaks out which makes it a triumph for Caleb. His motivation in these public interventions is to invite people to open their eyes and experience the unexpected. And his lesson to his children has always been to own the moment thus controlling the chaos that happens around them. But when the grown-up Baxter and Annie return home it exposes the declining success of the senior Fangs stunts as they go it alone in a world in which YouTube and social media can make anyone a performance artist. There are also subtle signals of the differences between Caleb who is a purist dedicated to the work and Camille whos in it for love though she has her secrets. When it becomes clear that their adult children have no intention of resuming their participation Caleb takes it as a personal betrayal. What happens soon after leaves Baxter and Annie with even more unanswered questions as the film glides almost imperceptibly into melancholy contemplation echoed in Carter Burwells exquisite score. A key childhood recap of a Romeo and Juliet production from their school years shows the decisive moment in which the children began to take issue with their parents use of them as art projects with little thought as to how the public exposure of those pranks made them feel. As specifically quirky as the Fang family unit is theres universality in the exploration of both the good and bad ways that children are shaped by their parents and the struggle to retain whats useful as they forge their individual identities. See more TIFF 2015 30 World Premieres to Watch The performances of the four leads could scarcely be better. Bateman is in unusually soulful mode and Kidman both flinty and vulnerable those qualities meshing in lovely relaxed fashion in their extensive scenes together. Plunkett brings tender grace notes to her role while Walkens affectless delivery and drill-like stare have not been this effectively used in years. Among the uniformly terrific supporting cast Harris Yulin (like Plunkett one of many New York stage actors involved) is memorable as the Fangs art school mentor and the pawn in one of their first major statement pieces. Batemans handling of tone is exemplary requiring constant modulation in a film that keeps moving back and forth in time in unpredictable yet fluid new directions and into darker emotional waters. He has also surrounded himself with an accomplished craft team. Beth Mickles production design and Amy Westcotts costumes have a nice lived-in quality while the many video inserts provide a rough-edged contrast to cinematographer Ken Sengs classical compositions in the contemporary scenes. For people who enjoyed Wilsons book this faithful adaptation will be a welcome reminder of its ""beautiful spontaneity"" to quote from the Fang manifesto. And for those unfamiliar with it the film will provide reasons to seek it out.
