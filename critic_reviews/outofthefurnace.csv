He is everywhere at the moment making his comeback as a character actor and reminding us theres much more to him than a latex mask and whispery growl. Hilarious in American Hustle as an overweight conman with a combover he is the best thing in this violent cheesily macho American thriller from Crazy Heart director Scott Cooper. Bale disappears into the role as an ordinary guy with everything against him giving an authentic white-knuckle performance. Shame about the rest of the film which aims for Bruce Springsteen with its blue-collar big themes and stadium-rock emotion but ends up as a bandana-wearing cliche. Bale is Russell the strong silent type and a guy who lives by the rules. Trouble is the rules arent rules any more. The Pennsylvania steel factory where he works is closing - its cheaper to import from China. Russell looks after his dying dad (in scenes calculated to squeeze a few manly tears from guys in the audience) and keeps his soldier brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) out of trouble. After a road accident lands him in prison Russell steps out of jail to find Rodney bare-knuckle boxing to pay off gambling debts. Enter lollipop-sucking hillbilly psychopath Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson). In the real world there is a suicide epidemic among Iraq veterans; they come home hurt themselves and sometimes the people they love the most. But thats not romantic or poetic or like The Deer Hunter (which this films director has surely seen a hundred times). So bare-knuckle boxing with hillbillies it is. Out of the Furnace wont win prizes for originality. Even the script knows how packed with cliches it is Im meant to be scared of you because youre sucking on a lollipop Affleck says to Harrelson. The film would be a complete joke were it not for a few unpredictable incredibly tense scenes and some undeniably powerful acting. Bale is as good as it gets Harrelson shows us why he is Hollywoods favourite psycho and Willem Dafoe is terrific as a sleazy drug dealer. The rest of the film is without a bat squeak of authenticity.

"Now Playing Bad Luck Tragedy and Travesty << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous The Road to Redemption  Next Over-rated (Clap Clap Clap Clap Clap) Allison Rosa/Long Strange Trip LLC Facebook Twitter Print Celebrities Now Playing Bad Luck Tragedy and Travesty The Coen brothers Dame Judi Dench and a mess starring Christian Bale and Casey Affleck. by Wesley Morris on December 6 2013 Inside Llewyn Davis opens in 1961 with the title character in a Greenwich Village bar with an acoustic guitar singing a folk song to a small rapt audience of young people. Glasses clank on the tables as he pleads ""So hang me oh hang me."" When hes done the applause and whistling are hearty. Because Llewyn Davis is a film by Joel and Ethan Coen it would be fair to expect that in due time Llewyn will be hung. These are two filmmakers whove put wood chippers and air compressors to lethal use for comedy and for dread. As my friend Mark said after he saw the movie These two think the Book of Job is funny. But the melancholy that suffuses this movie feels new. It isnt merely in the traditional folk hymns which T-Bone Burnett has produced and arranged. Its also in the smoky foggy blueish palette of Bruno Delbonnels cinematography and the brothers own restraint. For now theyve tabled the pleasure taken in bringing hell to earth. When we meet Llewyn played by Oscar Isaac the worst has already happened His musical partner Mike Timlin has thrown himself from a bridge. Now hes a solo act at an existential crossroads. Is he too pure for the coming folk explosion? Should he just rejoin the navy? Narratively the film is simply a series of deftly tailored episodes about what hes going to do with himself. Llewyn is another of the Coens luckless protagonists another Wile E. Coyote constantly beset by falling anvils. Its not just that his partner has killed himself. His mistress a singer named Jean (Carey Mulligan) tells him shes pregnant. Hes broke and homeless. And yet Llewyn differs from the Coens previous Jobs. God isnt punishing him. Llewyn is hurting himself. The sources of his woe are snobbery and narcissism. Nothing is good enough for him. He cant connect to anyone. Hed rather be a vagabond with principles than a man with a day job and a bed. Hes a lousy boyfriend brother son and friend. Exasperated harangues are all he brings out of women. His older sister (Jeanine Serralles) and the wife of a friend (Robin Bartlett) hit the roof. At one point Llewyn is invited to provide supporting vocals and guitar in a recording session with Jeans squeaky-clean boyfriend and folkmate Jim (Justin Timberlake). Its for a space-exploration ditty called ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" which they rehearse with a third fellow Al Cody (Adam Driver). Llewyn tries out some of the lyrics and harmonies and has to ask more or less who wrote this crap. Jim volunteers himself with Timberlake at his most hilarious virginal pitch. The minute we see these three bang out the song -- Driver doing the baritone interjections (""uh-oh"" ""outer [pause] space"") -- we know itll be a novelty hit. The first time I saw the film the theater erupted in applause when the song ended. Llewyn of course just wants the paycheck and briskly signs away his royalty rights but not his soul. The Coens included ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" because its catchy and clever and fun. But they also include it as an affront to Llewyns sense of authenticity. He seems to want to suffer -- not for his art but because of it. The brothers manage to capture the squareness of the early 1960s and the earnestness of the folk scene. ""Cool"" as it would come to be known was still being invented. A glimpse of it arrives in the form of Garrett Hedlund who still channeling On the Road plays a dude chain-smoking behind the wheel of the car that takes Llewyn and a rambling obese bluesman (John Goodman) from New York to Chicago for a gig. Some of the humor is cartoonish. Llewyn spends part of the movie chasing a cat that has escaped from his friends home. But whenever it appears as if the film will luxuriate in moronics the mood grays just enough. That runaway cat for instance becomes the closest connection he makes. Llewyn is such a source of insult to so many people that you cant imagine he was once socially productive. How could he have maintained a relationship with any woman let alone a fling with Jean? The answers are less in the writing and more in Isaacs presence. The film is a work of deceptive refrigeration. The character lacks the same sentiment and warmth as the men who created him. Its Isaac who takes some of the chill off. He doesnt cheat in playing Llewyns selfishness and abrasiveness. But the actor has a charisma that keeps him likable without pleading to be liked. But the movie isnt quite a satire. Nor is it entirely a road comedy. Its peculiarities amount to a plaintive hypothetical drama about what it might mean for Joel to exist without Ethan or the other way around. Isaac is a character actor whos been smartly deployed in a dozen other movies -- he was Mulligans ex-con baby daddy in Drive; the deviant orderly in Sucker Punch; and a Russian-born seducer in the underrated W.E. Madonna directed W.E. and she picked up on a strain of sexy showman in Isaac and let him run with it. Here he comes off like a full-blown movie star with a personality that functions almost independently of the mild contraption the Coens have built around him. For one thing the actor sings Llewyns songs himself so the sadness you hear in his voice is immediate. For another Isaac makes a shrewd creative decision Hes not playing most of the scenes in the emotional present. Hes physically there but appears to be trying to leave. When Llewyns partner dies he loses his other half. Thats where Isaac appears to be dwelling quietly on the loss bristling whenever anyone suggests he find another partner turning indignant when someone tries to finish an old Timlin-Davis tune. Only in song is Llewyn in the wounds of the here and now. The movie offers a punch line about the kind of folky superstardom Llewyn is missing out on. But it isnt quite a satire. Nor is it entirely a road comedy. Its peculiarities amount to a plaintive hypothetical drama about what it might mean for Joel to exist without Ethan or the other way around. We never meet Mike Timlin but get the sense he was indispensable to Llewyns sense of balance. Thats the source of the melancholy. Without Timlin Llewyn is unmoored a man with no answers blowing in the wind. Philomena contains a mystery thats solved in the first 40 minutes. What brings it to conclusion is not worth ruining. But the solution opens the film into something that will surprise even people familiar with the story of Philomena Lee. Lee was a retired Irish nurse living in England who as a young woman had her son taken from her by nuns who deemed her unfit for motherhood because she wasnt married. The boy was adopted by American parents. She spent 50 years with a broken heart and a nagging curiosity about what had happened to him. To the reluctant rescue came the journalist Martin Sixsmith freshly sacked from a job as a political adviser. He had plans to write a book about Russia but agreed to help Lee find her answers. The film directed by Stephen Frears begins as an odd-couple movie. Judi Dench plays Lee as a devout woman whos charming and easily charmed -- by the idea of Big Mommas House by the complimentary omelette that comes with her hotel stay and by the Mexican giant who cooked it. Steve Coogan makes Sixsmith a snob an atheist and a prig. He finds all that charm exasperating. But he becomes a committed sleuth both because he has a newspaper editor breathing down his neck and because as he and Philomena make their way to the United States he finds compelling her need to know if this long-lost son has ever thought of her or of Ireland. Coogan wrote the screenplay with Jeff Pope. Its smart and unsweetened. What interests them is not what happened to Lees son but why it happened and why the nuns decades later wouldnt help her find him. Eventually you realize theres a cover-up afoot that for years has depended on Philomena taking no for an answer. ""No"" simply makes Martin hungrier for a yes. Fondness and familiarity gradually shrink the chasms separating Martins temperament and class standing from Philomenas. Frears does nothing flashy or gratuitous. He can ply a film with theater (Dangerous Liaisons) noir (The Grifters) and tight tony TV-movie-ness (The Queen). But hes also good at natural staging. He often keeps Dench and Coogan in the same shot so you can see them reacting to each other. The sight of her nattering on about a romance novel as he barely disguises his disdain is very funny. Frears knows where all the human moments are. It also doesnt hurt that he has Dench to direct. Shes the least vain actress in the movies possibly ever. Here her hair is done as a kind of perm. The creases and wrinkles around her mouth suggest decades of contortion in worriment. She lacks actorly vanity. She serves only the needs of the scene even in juicy over-the-top garbage like Notes on a Scandal. As Philomena Dench has a climactic confrontation toward the end thats remarkable for how even she remains throughout. Her voice remains steady with hurt but not animated with the fury youd get in a different film. This kind of rational acting might not be for everybody. Weve been conditioned to expect fireworks during a showdown. Dench goes a different direction. She defuses which makes her restraint all the more devastating. Right now Alexander Payne is offering a droll observation of vanishing industrial and agrarian life in Nebraska. But if you crave a version that is ludicrously overwrought there is Out of the Furnace a movie that wants desperately to justify its violence with solemnified images of dead and dying steel plants in Braddock Pennsylvania. Braddock is about nine miles from downtown Pittsburgh and is meant to represent national decline. Scott Cooper directed the film and wrote it with Brad Ingelsby and he loads the story of two brothers and their respective dire straits with big ideas. But the films twin riffs on the stagnation of white masculinity and moribund American industry desperately require unpacking and ignition. Instead theyre used to give sociological ballast to a movie that just wants its physical assaults bare-knuckle boxing matches and stoic revenge to look handsome. The brothers are Russell (Christian Bale) and Rodney Baze (Casey Affleck). Russell toils in a steel mill. Rodney keeps disappearing from Braddock to fight in Iraq. A lifetime in the mill is killing their father. The Great Recession appears to be killing everyone else. Back for good from the war Rodney starts to box for a fixer (Willem Dafoe) then for a vision of druggy backwoods psychosis named Harlan (Woody Harrelson). There is nothing immediately objectionable about this premise. But Cooper begins flashing images of Barack Obamas nomination and election. He offers the embarrassing juxtaposition of Rodneys bloodied face with the image of dead deer. He either quotes from or directly echoes other movies -- The Deer Hunter Heat. What is he trying to get at? Where is he trying to go? A side plot has Russell emerging from prison to find that his ex -- who works with children and is played by Zoe Saldana -- has moved on to another man a police officer played by Forest Whitaker. This is a movie that might have been a great drama at four hours with a more ambitious script and a director with a vision or something to say. Whitakers so good in his couple of otherwise implausible scenes that you start to feel the film has been boiled down from a longer epic. But would two more hours really have made a difference? You never believe that Cooper knows what the gorgeous shots of puffing smokestacks and empty mills mean other than to signify blue-collar grit. You never believe he went beyond asking men like Bale Affleck and Harrelson who acquit themselves ferociously to represent male totems and movie cliches. (Coopers previous movie was the unpersuasive country-music slog Crazy Heart.) Worst of all is the disposable casting of Sam Shepard as a fading symbol of American movie masculinity. (He plays the Baze boys uncle.) At this point simply having him grace your grim adolescent fantasy doesnt confer authenticity or good taste. It implies that you saw him lazing about underused in someone elses movie -- The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford Brothers Safe House Mud -- and had to have him manning yours up too. Out of the Furnace joins Andrew Dominiks Killing Them Softly which also had a small part for Shepard and Derek Cianfrances The Place Beyond the Pines as another youngish directors attempt to do something substantial with violence and style. (The crime thrillers of James Gray have come thrillingly close.) These vacuous grim sometimes grisly movies want to speak to the troubles and fears of our times. But to even have a chance at achieving that a director ought to care about life as its lived outside the movies hes seen.

Directed by Ruairi Robinson. 98 minutes. Opens Dec. 6 at the Carlton. 14AThe faces are grim the situations are bleak and the locations are desolate -- one just happens to be on another planet.New releases Out of the Furnace and The Last Days on Mars have misery in common but also something of greater significance.Both films expend considerable talent on material that isnt up to snuff which makes for both frustrating and interesting viewing. Good actors really earn their pay when they have to negotiate bad scripts.Scott Coopers Out of the Furnace the better of the movies wears its deep blues like a faded tattoo. Its set in 2008 in the economic ghost towns of Braddock and North Braddock adjoining Pennsylvania burghs that long ago hummed and roared with the sound of busy steel mills.Now its ""cheaper to get steel from China"" Christian Bales mill worker Russell ruefully observes. He barely looks up from his beer when presidential candidate Barack Obama appears on the barroom TV promising hope and change in a rebuilt America.This is the closest to direct political commentary writer/director Cooper (Crazy Heart) and co-writer Brad Ingelsby get but the point doesnt need hammering. Its the familiar ""American Dream turns to nightmare"" story arc a Hollywood staple with special reference to The Deer Hunter.High ideals vanished long ago in the two Braddocks along with many jobs and most of the population. Theyre now places where fists fly and the testosterone fairly gushes -- Zoe Saldanas love-interest character Lena is like a teaspoon of sugar in a gallon of strong coffee.Russell is Lenas boyfriend although their romance is about as certain as his long-term prospects as a welder. But tough-minded Russell is a portrait of stability next to his brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) an Iraq War veteran with haunted eyes that speak of terrible memories.Rodney has a serious gambling addiction. Hes run up debts that he plans to dispose of not through hard work like his bro a source of friction between the two but through bare-knuckle brawls arranged by a local bookie (Willem Dafoe).The fighting brings Rodney to the attention of backwoods psychopath Harlan DeGroat a meth dealer who also dabbles in competitive bouts physical abuse of any kind being his main pleasure. He sucks on lollipops but hes no sweetheart as we see early on when he beats a man nearly to death during an argument at a drive-in theatre.The ferocity will return when the Baze brothers cross him and he crosses them in a matter that puts brotherly devotion to the test.DeGroat may just be the most brutal character Woody Harrelson has ever played and thats really saying something considering the many hard nuts hes cracked. He delivers an ""A"" effort in this decidedly ""B"" movie as do Bale and Affleck who act as if theyre in the most important movie of their careers.Along with Saldana and Dafoe theyre of like minds with Forest Whitaker who plays the towns pacifist sheriff and Sam Shepard the deer-hunting uncle of the Baze bros.The actors refuse to let a dull story blunt their edge and you can also see this determination in The Last Days on Mars a sci-fi potboiler that can be summed up with the plot line ""zombies on the red planet.""This first feature by Irish director Ruairi Robinson set in a future of manned interplanetary travel somehow snagged a berth in the prestigious Directors Fortnight at this years Cannes Film Festival. It also attracted a better-than-necessary cast that includes Liev Schreiber (Goon) Elias Koteas (Shutter Island) Olivia Williams (Anna Karenina) and Romola Garai (Atonement).Theyre part of the international team of eight astronaut-scientists completing a six-month stay on Mars in a research outpost called Tantalus Base. Theyre just 19 hours away from the arrival of the spacecraft Aurora which will return them to Earth.Then one of their teammates (Goran Kostic) insists on making one last foray across the rusty bleakness promising to return in the proverbial few minutes before nightfall. It turns out hes discovered signs of life in the form of a virulent bacteria that transforms him into a flesh-eating zombie in a pressure suit. Before you can scream Night of the Living Dead (or maybe Prometheus) a zombie astro-calypse is underway and the eggheads will have to decide whom they can trust and whom they must dust.Considering the assembled brain power and medical know-how it takes these astros forever to figure out that zombies cant be fixed only dispatched.The derivative script by TV writer Clive Dawson based on a short story by Sydney J. Bounds includes such horror cliches as someone foolishly announcing ""Im going out to meet them"" when two creepy unknowns show up outside the airlock.Yet the acting is convincing across the board especially Schriebers despite being saddled with such dialogue inanities as saying ""youre gonna be all right"" to a crewmate who is zombifying before his very eyes.The Last Days on Mars doesnt break any new dramatic ground but it does a reasonable job of stretching an obviously lean production budget. The Martian terrain is realistic and so are the claustrophobic research lab interiors.The sets do the job. But the actors really deliver above and beyond the call of duty just like their equally motivated confreres in Out of the Furnace.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Out of the Furnace - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Out of the Furnace Posted by Christy Lemire on December 8 2013 1 Comment Relativity Media Rated R for strong violence language and drug content. Running time 116 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four. ""Out of the Furnace"" is a down-and-dirty revenge picture whose classy cast elevates it above its gritty grimy trappings. Christian Bale and Casey Affleck are chief among them as troubled brothers who choose disparate paths to escape the morass of their depressed Steel Belt town. The year is 2008 in the midst of the presidential race; the economy hasnt even collapsed yet but this particular corner of Pennsylvania obviously has been in decline for a while. Bales Russell Baze toils all day at the local mill and spends his free time tending to his ailing father; his girlfriend a nursery school teacher played by a believably de-glammed Zoe Saldana provides him with the few opportunities for joy in his life. Younger brother Rodney (Affleck) has just returned from his fourth tour of duty in Iraq. Understandably shaken by his experiences there he struggles to make a little cash through bare-knuckle boxing and betting on horse races with the help of a low-level gangster (Willem Dafoe as ersatz father figure). Both brothers endure their share of ups and downs in this slow burn of a film from director and co-writer Scott Cooper. Having previously brought us ""Crazy Heart"" Cooper clearly knows his way around tormented damaged men. Here he borrows heavily from both early Bruce Springsteen songs and ""The Deer Hunter"" -- seriously theres even a subplot in which Russell hunts deer -- creating a vivid sense of place in this rusted town full of broken people. It may all seem familiar but the scenery is tangibly beautifully bleak. It takes him a while to get to the pivotal event that turns ""Out of the Furnace"" from a lived-in character study into a violent tale of vengeance. Cooper and co-writer Brad Ingelsby introduce us in startling fashion at the start of the picture to Harlan DeGroat the tatted and depraved meth dealer who rules the region from his ramshackle mountaintop hideout and who will become the target of Russells ire by the end. Woody Harrelson is just chilling in the role because hes so unpredictable but his inevitable collision with Bales character almost feels like an afterthought. It isnt nearly as compelling as everything that came before it simply because it feels so formulaic. Still the performances from a strong supporting cast that includes Sam Shepard as the brothers uncle and Forest Whitaker as the town sheriff always give the film a sense of substance and heft. Bale conveys so much through the sheer stillness and quiet of his presence. You can sense his characters internal urges to find a better way to turn his life around as well as the weight of the realization that he must commit some horrific acts in the name of redemption. (The fact that Russell becomes so knowledgeable and comfortable functioning as an undercover bad-ass isnt terribly well-developed however.) Affleck meanwhile takes the opposite approach His desperation and volatility are out there on display.  His raspy reed-thin voices constantly sounds as if its on the verge of breaking which adds tension to every scene hes in. You just know hes going to make one bad decision after another. But neither of these men will ever truly be able to climb out of the furnace -- theyll just get used to tolerating the heat. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Casey Affleck Christian Bale Forest Whitaker Willen Dafoe Woody Harrelson Zoe Saldana One Comment on ""Out of the Furnace"" January 5 2014  by  A Friend of Harry Lime     Hi Christie im in the UK and pretty much every critic had The Act of Killing as one their films of the year. Has this film opened in the states? i know its been shortlisted for an Oscar and yet no one on your side of the Atlantic seems to mention it. Plus if there was a film which demanded to be discussed on WTF it was The Act of Killing. Also just to wet your appetite a home grown picture which got rave reviews on its release The Selfish Giant. A grim bleak and brilliant coming-of-age tale. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

He made you ""absorb"" all the angst all the desperation all the pain and all the little nuance of a possible thrill of almost touching ""hope"". A very complexed but very real life on the wrong side of the track film. Tylersaid on Wednesday March 26 2014 11352 PMThis movie started out as a baby deer hunter but the took a turn to a revenge movie. While I think this movie was powerful I thought it could be a little more powerful if it would of stuck to Casey Aflecks character a little more and his struggles and how is brother deals with it. Samsaid on Tuesday March 18 2014 35431 PMI totally agree with this review it reminded me a lot of a great classic like deer hunter obviously not on quite the same scale but reminiscent of it. Harelson and bale deserved oscar nods. But I have to say that I enjoyed this movie much more than American hustle and even wolf of Wall Street which was a very entertaining movie. Richard why do you think it is that this movie didnt make it in the academy awards at all? Jack Tanseysaid on Thursday February 13 2014 13036 PMDear Mr. Roeper id like to start off by applauding your review of this film. Personally i felt like this film was overlooked by the academy; they couldnt even afford one nomination. I love Christian Bale and i think one could make the argument his work here is even stronger than American Hustle. Cooper is a director of genuine talent. He has a way of bringing out everything in his actors. He did it with Jeff Bridges with Crazy Heart which earned him an oscar. I would of loved to at least of seen a supporting actor for Casey Affleck who blew me away in this movie. After watching this movie im left excited to see what Cooper will bring us next. Johnsaid on Saturday February 01 2014 82808 PMRichard Roeper I didnt mind ""Out of the Furnace"" but I must say that the ending - especially the final shot - kind of made me dislike the movie. I found that it didnt resolve the movies issues and story in a satisfying way. I know that you loved the movie (You did give it an A+) but Im curious to find out what you thought about the ending. If you think its a bit early to discuss the ending thats okay but I would appreciate it if you wrote a response back. Reply from Richard Roeper Hi John I get what youre saying but Id like to wait until the movie is out on video for a few months before getting into the ending. All the best RichardLindasaid on Tuesday December 17 2013 105803 AMI dont think Ive ever agreed with every word of a movie review before but this review is one I couldnt agree with more. This movie stuck in my throat and every time I think about it it almost brings tears to my eyes. Everything in it was deep and thought provoking..the sibling relationship between Casey Affleck and Christian Bales characters Woody Harrelsons sinister presence Sam Shepards humble restraint the scenery in which something as simple as a car drive looking out the window makes you glad you dont live in that city...I just cant say enough about this movie..it affected me deeply and will stay with me for a very long time. GPKsaid on Sunday December 15 2013 52211 PMI cant stop thinking about this movie. The time spent to learn these characters in the film was so effective I could care less where the story took me. I cant say I have had such a movie experience before. I am not surprised many people did not like it. It was not your typical Hollywood film. Most people that go to the movies are looking for regular entertainment. This films focus on the story telling is incomparable to anything I have ever watched. I would like to see more of this kind of film making. Johnsaid on Thursday December 12 2013 122749 PMBest acted movie I think Ive ever seen. How Christian Bale didnt receive a Golden Globe nomination for best actor is an absolute joke. Casey Affleck also could have received a nomination in a supporting role what a shame. Harrisonsaid on Monday December 09 2013 72628 PMI give it about a C-. It was great acting and a great premise But it lacked any real suspense and at the end it was like whats the point. Everything abruptly ended without much explanation and there was no suspense or mystery around the disappearance of The brother. The script was below average as the story dragged in certain places that I didnt care about But where you wanted the suspense to play out it just ends and its like who cares. Steven Hassesaid on Monday December 09 2013 34657 PMI liked it too but I have to be honest I felt the beginning was a tad weak. But when the film went further it was really good. I personally give it a ""B-"" but I can see where youd like it. Comments 1 - 10 of 17 1 2 | Next 7   Page 1 of 2 POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 06 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 06 2013 1200AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Scott Cooper Written by Brad Ingelsby Scott Cooper Starring Christian Bale Woody Harrelson Casey Affleck Classification 14A Year 2013 Country USA/U.K. Language English Director Scott Coopers follow-up to his 2009 film Crazy Heart which starred Jeff Bridges in an Academy Award-winning performance as a lone-wolf country singer is about another kind of American masculinity on the ropes. Out of the Furnace has distinct echoes of Michael Ciminos post-Vietnam blue-collar drama The Deer Hunter both in its milieu and its focus on the after-effects of battle. The story follows mill-worker Russell (Christian Bale) and Iraq vet Rodney (Casey Affleck) struggling to survive in the American rust belt of Pennsylvania and to avoid the downward suck of crime and violence represented by Woody Harrelson as a hillbilly underworld kingpin; if the downbeat plot is depressingly familiar its partly salvaged by the quality of the performances. Video Video Weekend movie pick Alexander Paynes Nebraska a serious Oscar contender Jeff Bridges and Maggie Gyllenhaal in Crazy Heart. a(c)2008 Crazy Hearts Productions Inc. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Watch video Liam Lacey on Crazy Heart The film begins with a brief interlude at a drive-in theatre where Harrelson in the drivers seat opens the car door to vomit before returning to his whisky bottle. When his girlfriend raises a note of concern he goes on a rampage assaulting her and when a stranger attempts to intervene beating him senseless. The explosive set-up is an overture for whats to come.We shift to Braddock Pa. the home of the Baze family where things are tough and about to get worse the father is dying. The responsible son Russell works at the mill and lives with his schoolteacher girlfriend (Zoe Saldana). Meanwhile Russells baby brother Rodney is busy getting drunk and running up gambling debts around town.The time is the summer of 2008 Russell is knocking back a beer at the local bar while Edward Kennedy introduces the victorious Barack Obama at the 2008 Democratic convention. After Russell makes a payment on his brothers debt to a local bar-owner/loan shark (Willem Dafoe) he accepts a shot of whisky. Apparently it tips him over the limit A few moments later while driving home he smashes into a car backing out of a hidden lane. The result is a passengers death and a jail sentence for Russell.When Russell emerges from prison an unspecified time later his father is dead his girlfriend has left him for the local police chief (Forest Whitaker) and Rodney has started to participate in illegal bare-knuckle fights for cash another way to take money from the blue-collar gamblers. Rodney wants to fight in bigger matches run by a family of New Jersey drug-dealing hillbillies (a disparaging depiction of the mixed-race group known as the Ramapough Mountain Indians). The organizer of the fights is named Harlan DeGroat the out-of-control man we met in the opening drive-in scene.Harrelsons instinct to play DeGroat as a dandyish chops-licking psycho is probably astute inasmuch as Out of the Furnace needs a jolt of pure animal energy to raise it out of the doldrums of sad barroom stares and rusted factories but its at a cost to authenticity. Like the other characters here Harrelson looks a little too gym-fit and handsome for his hardscrabble dissolute life. His performance underscores how much the film relies on acting with a capital A the kind of showy performances that weaken the sense of authenticity. That also applies to Bale begging plaintively for his girlfriend to take him back or Affleck wild-eyed and ranting about the horrors he experienced in Iraq.There are just a few too many scenes of men in goatees squaring their shoulders and eyeballing each other in threat-downs which are part of Coopers fascination with the codes of masculinity. Particularly heavy-handed is a sequence when the film cross-cuts between a ceremonially solemn deer-hunting sequence in which Russell goes out in the woods with his uncle (Sam Shepard) and a fight scene with Rodney trading blows with an opponent in the midst a crowd of rabid strangers.Sometimes Coopers distinctly old-fashioned brand of emotional sincerity works as it did in Crazy Heart especially when he shows the gap between mens hard shells and their inner vulnerability. Sometimes though his reliance on archetypal devices - the brothers keeper plot for example - feels numbingly familiar. In the melodramatic showdown with Russell and DeGroat the progression of events has less to do with inescapable social forces than rusty dramatic conventions To paraphrase King Lear as flies to wanton boys are the characters to their screenwriter gods.

By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 05 December 2013 0752 PM Updated 06 December 2013 1227 PM Related Reel Genius Mob City is a decent enough L.A. noir but why? Music for murderers Narcocorridos and the compelling film Narco Cultura One neer-do-well brother drifting away and one with his feet on the ground. Stifling circumstances and desperate measures. Its the stuff of a thousand and one old stories but when the results pack the overhand right of Out of the Furnace the familiarity is easy to forgive.Grimy and unapologetically melodramatic Furnace pounds out a steady beat of pulp violence and possible redemption among folks who have seen better days. Its 2008 in the Pennsylvania steel town of North Braddock one of those beaten-down places where politicians venture to tell residents everything will get better. Rodney (Casey Affleck) has done four tours in Iraq; he gets his thrills and takes his dives in the nasty world of bare-knuckle boxing. His older brother Russell (Christian Bale) gets by working at the mill a job thats left their dad at deaths door.This is Deer Hunter war-at-home territory -- theres even a running deer-hunting motif -- updated for a new era of overseas misadventures and poverty. But the villain isnt just some intangible or sociological force. Theres also the deliciously named Harlan DeGroat a methed-up lowdown piece of murderous backwoods trash oozing with every bit of Woody Harrelsons menace. The movie actually opens with Harlan announcing his vile presence with authority at a drive-in movie all but promising hell be back to make life miserable for someone who matters.For all its spasms of brutality theres something quietly observational about Out of the Furnace a focused intensity that was mostly absent in writer-director Scott Coopers first feature Crazy Heart. You feel the dilapidated houses and spirit of a mill town left to die and the teasingly gorgeous Appalachian Mountains of New Jersey where Harlan and his clannish accomplices rule. The geographical truth of Furnace jumps off the screen the dingy corner bars and dark rural corners where you dont want to be stuck without a friend. Im also a fan of Dickon Hinchliffes string-heavy score and its shifts from longing to foreboding.This is most definitely a mans world but its hard to sell a movie without a woman in it. So we get a capable Zoe Saldana as Russells girlfriend and Forest Whitaker as his romantic rival. Theres not a bad performance in the movie; the cast also includes the gruff-and-ready Sam Shepard as the boys uncle. (Note to all filmmakers Nobody provides instant blue-collar street cred like Sam Shepard.) Willem Dafoe is excellent as a fight fixer who crawled out of a slightly higher ditch than Harrelsons Harlan.Out of the Furnace leaves no doubt that a reckoning is at hand and that one brother will have to answer for the other. The pleasure and the tension come from the process of watching the inexorable march and squirming under the vise grip that Cooper so steadily applies.Theres a reason why the old stories are so old. They have an irresistible pull. They can be updated to fit any time and place. And when a filmmaker executes them with passion and precision they can feel as fresh and bracing as a stiff mountain wind.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.OUT OF THE FURNACE (B+)Directed by Scott Cooper.

"Out of the Furnace (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Out of the Furnace (R) Two brothers fight to get by in this film by Scott Cooper the director of Crazy Heart. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com12/5/2013 Editor rating 3 Out of the Furnace takes place in a small Pennsylvania town where generations of men have followed their fathers into grueling thankless jobs at steel mills. The work is hard and unsatisfying but its steady and reliable and pays just enough to cover the bills. Russell (Christian Bale) is making a go of it spending his days dealing with searing heat and metal and caring for his aging father at home. Russells younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) reluctant to follow in the family tradition enlisted in the Army where he was rewarded with four tours of duty in Iraq. He returns home in 2008 damaged but still hopeful -- like Russell hes a bright spirit. But Russell is serving a prison sentence for a tragic accident their father has passed away and the recession has robbed Rodney of any job prospects. Scott Cooper who directed and co-wrote Out of the Furnace empathizes with people who feel their lives have hit a dead end (his previous film Crazy Heart earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar as a washed-up country singer who had given up on himself). These are difficult characters to dramatize -- if they dont care about themselves then why should we? -- and its even harder to keep their stories from becoming downward spirals of woe and despair. But the driving force behind Out of the Furnace is the love between two brothers who will do anything for each other -- anything -- because they are all they have left in the world after their dad dies. Russell is the more level-headed of the two Despite the accident that landed him in jail hes a responsible thoughtful man who takes pride in his community. But once hes out of prison he learns his girlfriend (Zoe Saldana) has left him to shack up with the local sheriff (Forest Whitaker) and Rodney has used the help of a small-time bookie (Willem Dafoe) to start competing in an underground fight ring lorded over by a deranged psychopath (Woody Harrelson in scary Natural Born Killers mode). The situation is so dire the prospects so dim that in practically any other movie you would check out fearful of the inevitable tragedy ahead. But Cooper knows how to keep you hooked. He gets small but potent performances from his impressive cast (Sam Shepard plays the brothers uncle) and Bale operating on a much quieter scale than the operatic Dark Knight pictures makes you share Russells desperation at trying to do right by those he loves (his brother) and those who no longer love him back (his girlfriend). The dingy fight clubs drab industrial backdrops and bursts of shocking violence wont be relatable to the average viewer. Youre always conscious youre watching a carefully constructed movie not real life (at least not your life). But Cooper much like he did with the country music industry in Crazy Heart makes you look past the strangeness of his scenario and focus on the humanity within. Affleck is heartbreaking as the wounded soul whose pride keeps getting in the way of his salvation Hes the movies tragic heart. But this is ultimately Russells story played with grace and dignity by Bale a man who has led his life the way he was supposed to in hopes of simply getting by until hes forced by honor and duty to resort to the kind of extreme acts that will doom him for life. Sometimes circumstance overrides logic and civility. Out of the Furnace is a boozy searing portrait of disenfranchised people trying -- and not always succeeding -- to eke out an existence. But the movie celebrates their humanity and struggle and makes you share their pain like molten steel on bare flesh.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 4 2013 Save for later Saved Out of the Furnace stars Christian Bale (l.) and Zoe Saldana (r.). Kerry Hayes/Relativity Media/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Puffed with self-importance ""Out of the Furnace"" wants to be a movie that speaks to Americas riven soul - a ""Deer Hunter"" for our time. Writer-director Scott Cooper who made a marvelous debut a few years back with ""Crazy Heart"" has gone full serioso here but what he is aiming for and what he hits are miles apart.Christian Bale plays Russell Baze a steel mill worker in Braddock Pa. whose brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) is a troubled Iraq war veteran. The film before it jumps ahead opens in 2008 during the Obama ascendancy. Russell ends up doing jail time for a fatal car accident and Rodney is stop-lossed for another tour of duty.Russell out of prison cant quite accept that his girlfriend (Zoe Saldana) has taken up with the local sheriff (Forest Whitaker). Rodney instead of following in the heavy footsteps of his brother and father in the mills is making chump change on the local bare-knuckle boxing circuit. He wants a bigger score - not always doable since his warrior instincts kick in whenever hes supposed to take a dive. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Rodney gets involved with an ultra-scurvy bunch of promoters from the New Jersey backwoods headed by Woody Harrelsons DeGroat a man who makes Willem Dafoe (who is also in the picture) seem like Don Knotts. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide The recession-era hardships of the working class the hopelessness and anomie plus the derangements of the returning vets all get a superficial airing here. But Cooper doesnt make much of a case for why the derangements in this movie are an expression of our ages ills. Rodneys hair-trigger rages and self-destructiveness would appear to long predate his war experiences and life in the steel mills has always been grievous. And bad guys like DeGroat are everpresent. This is fire-breathing melodrama masquerading as social commentary. Grade C+ (Rated R for strong violence language and drug content.)

Photo Courtesy Of Relativity Media Relativity Media Good cast cant save overheated Furnace 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Out of the Furnace Drama. Starring Christian Bale Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Scott Cooper. (R. 116 minutes.) Woody Harrelson lights his cigarette with a blowtorch in ""Out of the Furnace"" so hes clearly not a nice guy. He also has vividly messed-up teeth - not the usual messed-up teeth you find on the street but dramatic movie teeth gray and encrusted. And he likes getting in peoples faces breathing on them and smiling in his likable- goofy-maniac way that makes you think ""Wait is this a comedy?"" - just before he starts kicking a guy to death. He plays an evil New Jersey hick - Sinatra and Chris Christie to the contrary there are plenty of those - who has a crystal meth business and various other shady operations not to mention a dozen slightly less intelligent evil hicks working for him. Their houses probably dont have plumbing which accounts for the hygiene. Harrelson and his crew make up a colorful bunch but theyre not the focus of ""Out of the Furnace."" In fact they seem to be part of a different movie a dumb but lively sideshow in the midst of a long grim exercise in garden-variety pointlessness disguised as nihilism. Directed and co-written by Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"") ""Out of the Furnace"" somehow drags in two distinct and almost contradictory ways. It shambles and ambles seemingly without focus or pattern from one thing to the next. Yet at the same time its predictable not from moment to moment but in its outlines. Theres an older brother Russ (Christian Bale) and we know within seconds how things will work out with him and his younger more rebellious brother Rodney (Casey Affleck). We also have a pretty good idea that if Russ and the meth dealer (Harrelson) ever met they would not hit it off. The film is set in small-town Pennsylvania a world so grim that even when things are going good theyre going lousy. Russ works at ""the mill"" in between caring for his father who has a hospital bed in the house. And of course there are rumors that theyre closing down the mill. For at least 80 years of movies theyre always closing down the mill. As Russ Bale wears his hair long and has the kind of facial hair that announces to an employer that hes not really looking for a promotion. Russ has other things on his mind such as his younger brother who comes back from Iraq eager to make money and willing to cut corners to do it. For Affleck ""Out of the Furnace"" is another in his whiny-weird-Americana series and hes an interesting actor capable of imparting loads of unspoken meaning into a line such as ""It was bad."" But hes undermined by the script. The big character moment in which Rodney reveals the atrocities he has seen in Iraq plays like writing not talking like the screenwriters thought they had something really fine but didnt. The actors cant save it but occasionally they give us a scene that shows us why they chose to make the movie in the first place. Bale has a particularly well-played moment in which Russ finds out that the girl he loves the one he hopes to marry is pregnant by another man. And Harrelson is an amusing distraction throughout. Distractions are welcome. At one point Cooper shows cops surrounding a house and moving in. He intercuts the scene with shots of Harrelson cooking up some meth and smoking it. We assume from the way the sequence is edited that the cops are closing in on Harrelson but they arent. Its just a trick to impart tension where there is none - none at all.

(Kerry Hayes) A- Out of the Furnace Genre Drama; Starring Casey Affleck Christian Bale Woody Harrelson Zoe Saldana; Director Scott Cooper; Release Date Wide 12/06/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 116; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Relativity Media Posted December 18 2013 -- 1200 AM EST Life is cheap in Braddock Pa. a boarded-up rust-belt town of closing steel mills and busted dreams. The only thing left to count on is family. Thats the message that Scott Coopers Out of the Furnace returns to with harrowing frequency and force. Like 1978s The Deer Hunter Coopers devastating death trip nails the bond between two no-hope men pushed to violent extremes. Christian Bales Russell is a decent ex-con who cant catch a break. Casey Afflecks Rodney is his scarred younger brother whos just back from Iraq and is easy prey for Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) a skeevy sadist who dangles quick cash to get Rodney to brawl in a bloody bare-knuckle fight. When Rodney vanishes Russell follows his trail deep into the Appalachians to make DeGroat pay. All of the actors (including Zoe Saldana as Bales ex) are remarkable. But its Bale and his almost biblical quest for justice who burns his way into your soul.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In a depressed steel mill town two brothers are pulled into a criminal underworld. Rated R (violence language) BOTTOM LINE A somewhat formulaic Rust Belt noir but Bale delivers a visceral go-for-broke performance as a man who puts family above the law. CAST Christian Bale Casey Affleck Woody Harrelson LENGTH 156 Small-town America has been looking pretty rough in the movies lately from Alexander Paynes bedraggled ""Nebraska"" to the dreary upstate New York of Derek Cianfrances ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" Grimmer still is Braddock Pa. the backdrop for Scott Coopers ""Out of the Furnace."" Its a collapsing steel-mill town whose local economy seems driven mostly by off-track betting parlors grimy bars and inevitably a prison. Theres another hellhole however where even the meanest men in Braddock fear to tread New Jersey. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? In ""Out of the Furnace"" a gaunt and gristly Christian Bale plays Russell Baze a mill worker with prison in his past. His younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) has begun bare-knuckle boxing as a way to pay the bills and perhaps obliterate his memories of four tours in Iraq. Unfortunately Rodney books a fight in the Ramapo Mountains with some ""inbred mountain folk"" led by the psychotic Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson). When Rodney doesnt return Russell sets out to find him. Though ""Out of the Furnace"" takes place in the aftermath of Americas recent financial disasters its story feels timeless a Rust Belt noir about loyalty and vengeance. This is female-free territory (Zoe Saldana as Russells ex-girlfriend exists mostly to signify heterosexuality) but the taciturn machismo is punctuated by spasms of raw emotion. Russell Rodney and Harlan share a deep instinctive understanding No matter where theyre from they live in the same hard-luck world. Terrific performances from the three lead actors -- all perfectly cast and playing to their strengths -- help compensate for the slow pace and somewhat rudimentary plot. (Director and co-writer Cooper is switching gears slightly from 2009s bittersweet drama ""Crazy Heart."") Bale is particularly compelling After the movies brutal finale plays out and all guns are lowered the look on his face is genuinely spine-tingling. Its the kind of moment that makes ""Out of the Furnace"" feel almost profound even if the moral of its story essentially boils down to this Never go to New Jersey. 142 MoviesHoliday movie trailers PLOT In a depressed steel mill town two brothers are pulled into a criminal underworld. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING R (violence language) CAST Christian Bale Casey Affleck Woody Harrelson LENGTH 156 BOTTOM LINE A somewhat formulaic Rust Belt noir but Bale delivers a visceral go-for-broke performance as a man who puts family above the law. MoviesHoliday movie preview 2013 ----- Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff BEN AFFLECK TALKS TO VETS TO PREPARE FOR ROLE Halfway through ""Out of the Furnace"" Casey Affleck as Rodney goes to visit his older brother played by Christian Bale who is in prison for vehicular manslaughter. Rodney has just returned from his fourth tour of duty in Iraq; the two men havent seen each other in years. When asked about how things went overseas Rodney just stares at his brother his eyes suddenly veiled and dark and haunted. The scene is subtle and deceptively simple and Afflecks performance in that small throwaway moment is remarkable using stillness and silence and a blank expression to convey his characters great inner pain. To capture his characters great inner pain Affleck talked to many veterans who shared their stories and insights. ""When you spend several years living in an incredibly stressful environment you go through intense trauma and it changes your brain chemistry"" he says. ""Youre essentially a different person. You have all these memories and all these anxieties. You can be at the grocery story or working at a restaurant and youre trying to behave in the same way people who havent been in combat do and its super hard. You cant just erase some of the terrible things you see during war. Those were the things I thought about during that scene."" -- Miami Herald Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Kerry Hayes/Relativity Media Out of the Furnace Director Scott Cooper Genre Crime drama Running Time 116 minutes Rated R for strong violence language and drug content With Christian Bale Casey Affleck Zoe Saldana Woody Harrelson Both literally and thematically dark Out of the Furnace simmers with manliness like a slow-cooking pot of venison chili. This is the sort of movie where character is revealed by what the protagonist decides to hunt and possibly kill. A noble buck in the Pennsylvania woods? Maybe not. A murderous meth-dealing bare-knuckle-boxing promoter? Bang Our hero is Russell (Christian Bale) a small-town dark knight. He works near the belching furnace of a steel mill in Braddock one of those rust-belt decrepitudes that draw photographers and filmmakers keen to eulogize American industry. Perhaps because he wants to minimize dialogue director and co-writer Scott Cooper starts the tale several years before most storytellers would. Its 2008 as Cooper indicates with a clip of Teddy Kennedy endorsing Barack Obama. Russells father is dying and his hotheaded younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) is headed to a fourth tour in Iraq. At least Russell has a job and a girlfriend (Zoe Saldana). Then a nasty car crash sends Russell to prison. (It wasnt really his fault but he had been drinking.) When he gets out Dads dead and girlfriend Lena has moved on to a passionless but safe relationship with a local cop (Forest Whitaker). Rodney for his part is boxing for an amiable local bookie and loan shark (Willem Dafoe) though hes soon to meet a much more dangerous example of that breed Harlan (Woody Harrelson). i Rodney gets mixed up with the wrong kind of people while Russell is in prison including a loan shark (Willem Dafoe right) and a psychotic bookie (Woody Harrelson left). Kerry Hayes/Relativity Media hide caption toggle caption Kerry Hayes/Relativity Media Rodney gets mixed up with the wrong kind of people while Russell is in prison including a loan shark (Willem Dafoe right) and a psychotic bookie (Woody Harrelson left). Kerry Hayes/Relativity Media After angering the easily maddened Harlan Rodney disappears. Russell and his uncle (Sam Shepard) go looking for him on Harlans home turf a backwoods section of New Jersey that seems more like West Virginia. There are several wrong turns and dead ends before the final showdown which is more sorrowful than exhilarating. Coopers previous movie the overrated Crazy Heart indulged a different sort of macho. Its tale of an alcoholic country singer on the road and in decline seems positively jaunty next to Out of the Furnace whose musical signature is Pearl Jams plaintive ""Release."" (The song plays at both the movies beginning and end.) The film like the recent Mother of George is distractingly dim. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi illuminates many scenes with light from behind or outside keeping the casts haggard faces in shadow. The effect is a little artier than befits this unusually deliberate but otherwise predictable drama. The movie boasts two kinds of showcases. The first are elaborately crosscut sequences in which good men and bad men act all too simultaneously. These turn on violence which apparently is the currency of male existence or at least working-class rust-belt male existence. Better are the simple heartfelt scenes in which Russell and Lena fight their feelings for each other in the hope that Lena can have the stable nurturing life she wants. Such moments are far more interesting than Harrelsons showy turn as a lollipop-sucking psychopath. That love is preferable to death is a subversive idea for a movie full of tough guys who cant walk away from mayhem whether because of family duty PTSD or just for the heck of it. But there are merely glimmers of that moral in this grim ode to vengeance. Cooper does slow the action and set it in the least glamorous of circumstances which drains the pleasure from the thriller conventions. But just because Out of the Furnace isnt much fun doesnt make it profound.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 512pm on Thursday Dec. 05 2013 Thursday Dec. 05 2013 Thursday Dec. 05 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Out of the Furnace director Scott Coopers first movie since his Oscar-winning Crazy Heart four years ago is stoked with elements from so many other films that it easily could have slipped down the rabbit hole of cliche. Taking place in a small town in Pennsylvanias Rust Belt it has everything a viewer would expect when Hollywood goes blue-collar a steel plant on the verge of shutting down quarreling working-class brothers meth and lots of hootin and hollerin from locals with bad teeth.But Out of the Furnace based on a script from Cooper and Brad Ingelsby is saved by a couple of surprises and mostly by the performances from its big-ticket cast.Christian Bale is Russell Baze a good-hearted mill worker with a girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana) who loves him. He has his problems -- a dying father and a hot-headed brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) whod rather gamble than get a real job -- but lifes OK.Things take a turn for the worse though when Russell after drinking is involved in a car wreck that kills passengers in the other car. He is sent to prison and Rodney without Russell around to cover his debts gets in deeper with a loan shark John (Willem Dafoe) who also happens to stage backwoods bare-knuckle brawls for bloodthirsty mobs. Meanwhile Lena ends up in the arms of another man police chief Wesley Barnes (Forest Whitaker).To pay off his debt once and for all Rodney agrees to be the fall guy and take a dive in a fight organized by vicious drug dealer Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) who as we see in the movies opening scene is not above choking his girlfriend with a drive-in hot dog for sport. Hes so unhinged that he even scares John. Its a role Harrelson throws himself into with relish.When Russell comes home he tries to get Rodney out of this dangerous game hes playing but its too late. So Russell takes it upon himself to confront DeGroat.Bale is effective as the put-upon older sibling trying to keep his emotions in check while Affleck is explosive as the younger brother not long returned from Iraq who cant find his footing. Saldana best known for the ""Star Trek"" reboots and Avatar really gets to show a range that shes rarely asked to display.The tense triangle involving Lena Russell and Wesley -- riven by unspoken divisions of class and race (the 2008 election of President Obama plays on a TV in an early scene; blacks and whites in town dont seem to mix much) -- gives Out of the Furnace a surprising depth beyond the brother battles driving the main narrative. As usual Whitaker quietly shines in his part even if he doesnt have enough to do. Out of the Furnace isnt the most original film of the year but that doesnt lessen its enjoyment.

"Out of the Furnace | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; out-of-the-furnace ) Out of the Furnace (United States 2013) December 05 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Steel once a bulwark of American industrial might was transformed over a short span of decades from a thriving commercial enterprise into a fossilized shell of its glory days. Once an engine of prosperity and a provider of reliable employment it became known for the hardship and blight left in its wake as the domestic market shriveled under pressure from cheap imports. The collapse of Big Steel left behind numerous dead and dying communities. Among those was Braddock Pennsylvania a Pittsburgh suburb of 3000 with 35% of the population below the poverty line. This real-life locale is where Out of the Furnace transpires and Braddocks personality as a town discarded by progress makes it more than just a setting for a revenge thriller; its as important a character as any of the humans. Out of the Furnace is moody and atmospheric but lapses in narrative logic and a confused sense of geography can create frustration. The movie takes its time; the tone is that of a slow burner occasionally interrupted by sudden violent interludes. Thematically Out of the Furnace explores the nexus between revenge and justice as it follows a character whose every step extends the mass of guilt weighing upon him. Director Scott Coopers previous outing was 2009s Crazy Heart which won Jeff Bridges his long overdue Oscar. Like Crazy Heart Out of the Furnace is steeped in an understanding of how the location influences the characters. No one in Braddock is rich - its just a matter of how poor each individual is. The lead character Russell Baze (Christian Bale) is a hard-working man who puts in his daily shift at the steel mill in order to make ends meet. His brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) has endured several tours of duty in Iraq and is having trouble putting his life back together. Hes deep in debt to a local bookie and loan shark John Petty (Willem Dafoe) and becomes involved in clandestine bare-knuckle boxing matches to make a little cash most of which he gambles away. Desperate to make a big score Rodney accompanies Petty to New Jersey where hes introduced to Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) a sociopath with a short fuse and a love of violence. Meanwhile Russell newly released from prison after being convicted in a drunk driving homicide tries to come to grips with the results of his incarceration. Russell is a tragic figure in the classical sense. His life - at least what we see of it - is a cavalcade of pain disappointment and sadness. In the end he has little to cling to but a deep-rooted sense that a wrong has been done and its his responsibility to right it. The consequences he might have to suffer both in real and metaphysical terms are of no matter. Christian Bales method acting allows him to burrow under Russells skin. Its a solid but not overwhelming performance - certainly strong enough to get viewers to sympathize with him. Over the course of a varied career Woody Harrelson has played his share of unpleasant individuals but none - not even the one in Seven Psychopaths - has been as reprehensible as DeGroat. His misanthropy and misogyny which at times approach an almost cartoonish level are evident in the first scene and he doesnt soften. Harrelson is so good at being evil that its difficult to remember that his career began with him playing the good-hearted naA-ve bartender in Cheers. Casey Affleck represents an enigma. Normally chosen to play shy characters that demand low-key portrayals Affleck is cast against type as the pugnacious Rodney. Damaged by his war experiences Rodney lives in a state of unrelieved pain and Affleck brings that quality home with a performance that is at times riveting. There is however an issue Affleck is physically wrong for the part; at no point did I accept him as a possible winner of bare knuckle boxing matches let alone someone who could win money for bettors by taking a dive. The second half of Out of the Furnace is in need of tightening. The narrative bogs down with a superfluous road trip for Russell and his uncle (played by the reliable Sam Shepard) and there are instances in which mostly minor plot elements dont make sense. Basic geography issues related to the state of New Jersey indicate the directors lack of familiarity with the area in which several scenes transpire. Out of the Furnaces nihilism will make it unappealing to those on a quest for a feel-good time and its slow meditative style disqualifies it for anyone wanting a more active thriller. Its trying to be a companion piece to Winters Bone but the screenplay isnt as literate or well realized. Out of the Furnace features some nice performances and is deliciously atmospheric but it never achieves its goal of being a compelling meditation about how the economic erosion of a community influences the lives of those trapped within it.

December 5 2013 -- 329pm Relativity Media Casey Affleck plays a rootless violence-prone veteran in ""Out of the Furnace."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert The raw-boned crime drama ""Out of the Furnace"" is set in a dying Pennsylvania steel town one of those forlorn whistle stops from a Bruce Springsteen ballad. Christian Bale plays Russell a second-generation laborer in the rusted-out Braddock mill and the title hints at his fate. When he takes on one of the most fearsome backwoods crime families on the East Coast with only his wits and a hunting rifle hell either emerge stronger because of the heat he has endured or hell be consumed. Director/co-writer Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"") sets his hardscrabble story in 2008 linking it to the economic malaise of the great recession and the homefront repercussions of the Iraq war. As their bedridden father lies dying at home Russells younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) a rootless violence-prone veteran is losing big on horse races. Russell intercedes on his behalf with the town loan shark (Willem Dafoe in a kindhearted take on a traditionally threatening character). But when an accident earns Russell four years in prison for involuntary manslaughter hotheaded Rodney digs himself in deeper. Rodney puts his combat skills to use in an underground fighting circuit. Woody Harrelson plays the kingpin DeGroat a leering hillbilly Caligula. If Rodney throws some bare-knuckle fights DeGroat will erase his debts. But Rodney has a hard time obeying anyones orders especially when his fighting blood is at full boil. The noir plot elements here are venerable to say the least. Cooper refreshes the well-worn material with a powerhouse cast (Zoe Saldana plays Russells girlfriend who moves on to local lawman Forest Whitaker when hes sent away). Cooper whose previous film got Jeff Bridges a best actor Oscar draws committed performances from his stars. You can almost smell Harrelsons rancid meth-dealer. Theres a touching reunion scene between Saldana and Bale who trembles at first then sags when he finally realizes where he stands with her. The hair-trigger family dynamic between the close but conflicted brothers feels raw and authentic. Sam Shepard as their easygoing uncle exudes the kind-but-tough solidity of a modern Gary Cooper. Despite the presence of unforgivably derivative sequences lifted from ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" the direction is trim and brutal. Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi (of the Liam Neeson wolf adventure ""The Grey"") knows how to shoot the storys desolate camera-friendly locales and its bloody confrontations. He makes the characters violence caveman-primitive and lacerating. Still I wouldnt rank this unrelentingly efficient film with top rural noirs like 2010s ""Winters Bone"" or this falls ""Prisoners."" Theres nothing ambitious in the films design no greater resonance beyond the immediate story. It says nothing about vigilante justice the fate of returning vets or manufacturing communities becoming ghost towns. Its grim solid suspense craftsmanship nothing more.

(Kerry Hayes) By Ann Hornaday December 5 2013 Follow AnnHornaday The unforgiving back roads and rusted-out mill towns of Appalachia provide the bleak backdrop and emotional landscape of ""Out of the Furnace"" a well-acted beautifully filmed utterly depressing chronicle of revenge and thwarted dreams in post-industrial America. Anchored by compelling performances from Christian Bale and Casey Affleck ""Out of the Furnace"" may have taken its title and setting from Thomas Bells 1941 novel ""Out of This Furnace"" about the immigrant community in Braddock Pa. and the history of unionization. But director Scott Cooper with co-writer Brad Inglesby sets his story squarely in the recent past when Bales character Russell Baze works in a steel mill on the brink of closing while his brother Rodney (Affleck) prepares for yet another tour in Iraq. ""Out of the Furnace"" transpires over several years during which the fortunes of the brothers diverge and overlap most notably when a menacing meth dealer and bare-knuckle boxing impresario named Harlan DeGroat comes to town. Played with terrifying intensity by Woody Harrelson DeGroat is a sadistic almost feral figure who hails from New Jerseys Ramapo Mountains as lawless and god-forsaken a place as any redoubt in the Wild West. Braddock where much of ""Out of the Furnace"" was filmed emerges on the other hand as a relatively civilized refuge where Russell quietly tries to rebuild his life after a tragic mistake amidst the crumbling remnants of a once-thriving town. Cooper who directed ""Crazy Heart"" a few years ago once again evinces a gift for conveying atmosphere carefully framing and composing his shots to lend ""Out of the Furnace"" a reserved even stately air of dignity. And he knows how to get the best from his actors (Jeff Bridges who won an Academy Award for his performance in ""Crazy Heart"" might agree). Affleck delivers a searing portrayal of a young man who pushes himself to the punishing physical limit in search of both money and catharsis. Bales part may not be as showy but at least one moment -- when Russell hears a pivotal piece of news on one of Braddocks bridges -- could stand the test of time as a mini-master class in the art of screen acting. Sam Shepard Willem Dafoe Zoe Saldana and Forest Whitaker -- this years movie MVP -- round out an outstanding supporting cast in a story that evokes ""The Deer Hunter"" in its depiction of post-war trauma in a Pennsylvania town as well as ""Winters Bone"" in its gothic sometimes labored portrayal of what happens when a society has abandoned its working class. There are good men in ""Out of the Furnace"" as well as bad men and sad men and stupid men -- but even the best of them have blood on their hands usually their own. Even when it descends into self-consciousness in a lurid final act ""Out of the Furnace"" effectively brings viewers into a space where whatever people had to lose was either squandered or stolen.

Also starring Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan. (Photo/Video CBS Films) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com Dec. 5 2013 104 p.m. ET ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" which was written and directed by Joel Coen and Ethan Coen begins with a three-minute song sung by the struggling folk singer of the title; hes played to perfection by Oscar Isaac. The setting is the Gaslight Cafe in Greenwich Village in 1961 just before the folk-music scene was transformed by the arrival of Bob Dylan. Elegiac and stirring in equal measure the song sets the dominant tone of this beautiful film even if some of the plots twists and turns are very funny. Llewyn the wayward troubadour is living out his own ballad of love and loss. He would seem to be his own worst enemy and he certainly can be an angry fool. Yet it isnt that simple as we come to understand during a week of his life that threatens to go from bad to worse. Llewyn sings songs of death and dying partly because he loves them but also because he has lost a musical soul mate who may well be irreplaceable. Dead broke and braving a New York winter without a coat he crashes on couches in friends apartments and wears out his welcome in the process. His best friends wife Jean (Carey Mulligan) calls him King Midass idiot brother. Related How the Coen Brothers Cast Inside Llewyn Davis T Bone Burnett and the Coen Brothers Move the Music Needle Music has long been an important part of the Coen brothers films; folk songs of an earlier era filled the sound track of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" their goof on Homers ""Odyssey."" This time music is the storys heart and soul and the trip is as much a pilgrimage as an odyssey by an artist whos unswervingly faithful to his art. Llewyn wont sell out by being frivolous though he does earn a little money playing guitar in a recording session--the occasion is a cheerfully absurd novelty number by a zero-gravity group called the John Glenn Singers. (""Please Mr. Kennedy I dont wanna go please dont shoot me into outer space."") But cartons of his first solo album which was a flop have already been remaindered and his working life can be summed up in a producers eight-word response to a folk song that he sings with heartbreaking eloquence ""I dont see a lot of money here."" As an evocation of a seminal period in popular culture the production is peerless; no feature film has ever explored the intersection of the folk movement and the Beat Generation with such fidelity to the spirit of the time. (T Bone Burnett was the films music producer. Bruno Delbonnel was the cinematographer.) The script was inspired by ""The Mayor of MacDougal Street"" Dave Van Ronks memoir about the music scene in Greenwich Village and some of Llewyns songs come from Mr. Van Ronks repertoire though the hero is essentially a fictional creation. Other musicians may be called to mind by the figures on screen Peter Paul and Mary; the Clancy Brothers; and hauntingly the young Dylan whose curly haired presence can be seen in the Gaslights spotlight toward the end. The films centerpiece is Mr. Isaacs phenomenal performance. Hes an actor first and foremost who is also a musician but youd never know it from his self-effacing mastery; he looks and sounds to be a seasoned folk singer with an uncanny gift for naturalistic acting. Self-effacement characterizes the direction as a whole. Theres none of the Coen brothers trademark archness in the superb ensemble acting that in addition to Ms. Mulligan includes Justin Timberlake as a singer with overtones of Paul Clayton; Stark Sands as Troy Nelson a stand-in for Tom Paxton; and F. Murray Abraham as a producer-manager so closely modeled on Albert Grossman that his name is Bud Grossman. During a road trip that Llewyn takes to Chicago John Goodman does a deliciously gothic riff as Roland Turner a pool hustler cum hipster musician who seems to be a drugged-out amalgam of Dr. John and the singer-songwriter Doc Pomus. Movies about musicians are often filled with angst along with prohibited substances and booze yet they usually manage to end on an upbeat. The outlook here is guarded. Llewyn doesnt drink or do drugs but his whole life is in danger of being remaindered. ""Do you ever think about the future at all?"" Jean asks with a withering scorn thats relieved by furtive tenderness. ""You mean flying cars?"" Llewyn replies wryly. ""Hotels on the moon?"" His future will stay uncertain until he finds a place of his own--in the world as well as in the cold city. Corrections amp; Amplifications The name of singer-songwriter Doc Pomus was incorrectly spelled as Potus in earlier versions of this article. Watch a clip from the film ""Out of the Furnace."" When Rodney (Casey Affleck) disappears and law enforcement fails to follow through his brother Russell (Christian Bale) takes matters into his own hands. (Photo/Video Relativity Media) Out of the Furnace One of the many bright surprises of Scott Coopers 2009 debut feature ""Crazy Heart"" was how well the rookie filmmaker worked with actors. A near-indispensable step in the process is casting good actors to begin with but the uniform excellence of the performances suggested a promising directorial sensibility. Mr. Coopers second feature which he wrote with Brad Ingelsby makes good on that promise and then some. The cast is once again extraordinary--Christian Bale Casey Affleck and Woody Harrelson along with Willem Dafoe Sam Shepard Zoe Saldana and Forest Whitaker--and these gifted people play their roles memorably. (Masanobu Takayanagi did the stunning cinematography.) But the film is as grim as it is impeccably crafted. I admired it ever more intensely until I realized I wasnt enjoying it so much as enduring its unremitting bleakness. The story turns on two brothers and two furnaces. Mr. Bales Russell Baze works those of a mill in a Pennsylvania town where theyre still making steel though not for much longer; the time is 2008 and heavy industry has been moving to Asia. Mr. Afflecks Rodney Baze Russells younger brother is back from the furnace of Iraq and seethingly rageful; at one point he vents his rage in a scene of immense power. Mr. Harrelsons Harlan De Groat is evil incarnate a terrifying brute who first appears in a violent preface--the level of violence in this film is exceedingly high--then reappears to blight the lives of both brothers. Mr. Bale ever the brilliantly inward performer makes Russell sympathetic with small strokes--the tenderness he displays toward his girlfriend Lena (Ms. Saldana) and toward his ailing father (Bingo OMalley). Mr. Affleck is inward too and insufficiently appreciated because his work is never flashy; he uses his breathy voice and constrained affect to make us understand that Rodney though in debt and adrift will do anything to set himself a profitable course. Thats where Harlan De Groat comes in. Hes the malign alpha male of whats referred to as a group of ""inbreds from Jersey."" (Much has been reported over the years about the existence in the Ramapo mountains of northern New Jersey and southern New York of just such a group one of whose family names is in fact DeGroat.) When Rodneys money woes move him into the orbit of Harlans crime ring he soon disappears and Russell frustrated by police inaction takes the law into his own hands. And thats where ""Out of the Furnace"" devolves from an electrifying character study into a disappointing tale of trackdown and revenge. Its not that Russell and Harlan arent mesmerizing antagonists or that the inevitable climax isnt elegantly staged. The disappointment lies in the inevitability. The outcome is no more or less than what we expect it to be and that doesnt come close to enough. Rewind DVD // Streaming // Download ENLARGE One Trick Pony (1980) In a class by itself when it comes to melancholy accounts of musicians on the road. (Llewyn Davis suffers all the miseries of being on the road without actually going on a road tour.) Paul Simons fictional folk singer Jonah Levin was big in the 1960s but 20 years later hes struggling to make a new album and save his failing marriage. Melancholy or not its a terribly touching film and Mr. Simon is fine in a role that keeps him on screen throughout. Robert M. Young directed from Mr. Simons original screenplay. ENLARGE Intolerable Cruelty (2003) Joel Coen directed this quick-witted comedy from a screenplay he wrote with Robert Ramsey Matthew Stone and his brother Ethan Coen. The first time we see George Clooneys hotshot divorce lawyer its by the eerie light of tooth-whitening equipment in a dentists office. Miles Massey cares about his teeth. Theyre part of his panache in a glittering Los Angeles milieu of ambition and wealth where teeth are razor-sharp and often bared. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Marylin a gorgeous schemer who wants to take her filthy-rich husband--and Miless woefully foolish client--to the cleaners. ENLARGE Gone Baby Gone (2007) Casey Affleck makes an improbable but plausible hero in this thriller about the search for a missing 4-year-old girl. Hes Patrick Kenzie a diffident private eye who turns out to be one smart sheep among underworld wolves. The film was directed by the stars older brother Ben Affleck whose behind-the-camera debut is not just plausible but admirable; hes expert with actors pays attention to telling details and sustains a dark tone of pervasive evil. (John Tolls cinematography gives the darkness an alluring glint.) The cast includes Ed Harris Morgan Freeman Amy Ryan and Michelle Monaghan.

Relativity Media photo The average moviegoer doesnt know what producers do but they supervise almost every aspect of the film from approving the script to hiring the cast and crew. The credits for ""Out of the Furnace"" list 18 producers and executive producers including such famous names as Leonardo DiCaprio director Ridley Scott and his late brother Tony Scott. These are rich people and from the evidence on screen they dont know much about the kind of working-class desperadoes depicted in the movie. This supposed slice of life is so half-baked its poisonous.The investors must have celebrated when they signed Christian Bale to play the role of Russell Baze a steelworker in a Pennsylvania town who keeps his bloodied nose to the grindstone. Bale is Welsh but as he proved in ""The Fighter"" hes got an ear for American grunts and groans. Russell lives with a schoolteacher (the impossibly pretty Zoe Saldana) and secretly pays the gambling debts of his neer-do-well brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) who hasnt been the same since he got back from Iraq.Yet its Russell who goes to the slammer (under circumstances that are irritatingly fuzzy) while Rodney runs afoul of local crime boss John Petty (Willem Dafoe). Around the time that Russell is paroled little brother Rodney enters the secret world of high-stakes bare-knuckle boxing -- among the meth-crazed hill folk of northern New Jersey. (I kid you not.) The kingpin of this ugly-duckling dynasty is Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) an overly accessorized stereotype of a backwoods bad-ass. When Rodney fails to follow the script and take a dive in a big boxing match theres a price to be paid -- and brother Russell is the one to pay it.""Out of the Furnace"" is one of the dumbest and ugliest movies of recent memory. In a low-ball bid for authenticity sophomore director Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"" ) shoots most of the action with grainy film stock and hand-held cameras; yet in this grimy milieu all the neck-tattooed goons drive priceless old muscle cars. Thats the kind of falsehood that a conscientious producer would have nixed. Copper uses blunt instruments to siphon the same sap as ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" but he forgot to give us characters worth caring about. Even Forest Whitaker as an outgunned cop is left stranded in the woods. And a subplot about deer hunting is merely a ploy to scavenge the wintry bones of a certain Oscar-winning movie set in the same region.""Out of the Furnace"" is hot air.What ""Out of the Furnace""  Two stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 156  Content Violence strong language and drug use Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Celebrities Who Have Left Scientology Out of the Furnace Out of the Furnace Credit Kerry Hayes By Peter Travers December 5 2013 More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> More News Peter Travers Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> This is only Scott Coopers second film as a director but he already knows how to bring out lived-in authenticity in actors. His 2009 debut with Crazy Heart resulted in an Oscar win for Jeff Bridges. Out of the Furnace walks meaner streets than that country ramble. The film opens in 2008 with Obama calling for change and no one buying it in Braddock Pennsylvania where you work in the Carrie Furnace mill if youre lucky enough to work at all. Remind you of The Deer Hunter much? It should. Out of the Furnace simmering with Rust Belt malaise echoes Michael Ciminos epic about Pennsylvania steelworkers and Vietnam. Jeez theres even a deer hunting scene. It takes a while to stop making comparisons. But the actors pull you in. Christian Bale haunted and haunting plays Russell Baze a guy who works the Furnace cares for his dying father romances Lena (Zoe Saldana) then winds up in prison (for reasons I wont spoil). His younger brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) escaped Braddock by doing three tours of duty in Iraq. But now hes back getting in with the wrong people and trying to pay off gambling debts by having his buddy John Petty (Willem Dafoe) book him for brutal bare-knuckle fights in New Jerseys Ramapo Mountains. The boss everyone owes and fears is Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) a meth-head maniac whose violent streak is a mile wide. The reliably terrific Harrelson lacing terror with lacerating wit gives the role enough menacing juice to back off an army. Only Russell just out of prison and having lost Lena to the local sheriff (Forest Whitaker) has the balls to take him on with the help of his no-bull Uncle Red (Sam Shepard). Thats the setup which works out along familiar lines. But what gives the movie its heat is the acting. Affleck his eyes pools of pain is outstanding. His scenes with Bale all coiled intensity ready to spring are electric. Its the bruised history of these brothers that gives Out of the Furnace its beating heart and the power to grip you hard.

Comments click to enlarge Out of the Furnace Video Rated R  116 minutes  2013 Scott Coopers Crazy Heart (2009) was the ticket to an Oscar for Jeff Bridges and after four years the writer-director follows it with another actors showcase getting potent work from Casey Affleck and Christian Bale as loving brothers on divergent paths in working-class Pittsburgh. Following a prison term Rodney (Bale) works at the mill like their late father and tries to put his life back together; still full of war after multiple tours in Iraq Russell (Affleck) starts earning cash as a bare-knuckle fighter out in the mountains competing in matches run by a local scumbag (Woody Harrelson at his most intimidating). The macho drama is nicely drawn for most of the movie with a genuine sense of hard times in millennial America though Cooper lets it drift into the sort of revenge plot that propels innumerable action movies.

"Out of the Furnace 3.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Out of the Furnace 3.5 stars Stellar acting swamped by blue-collar tales overheated writing SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Dec 5 2013 1103 AM ""Out of the Furnace"" goes so far out of its way to be gritty and meaningful that it sometimes neglects its strongest feature its actors. Scott Coopers film follows a down-and-out family in the down-and-out town of Braddock Penn. where the best you can hope for is a job down at the mill -- and things arent looking good there either. Thats where Russell Baze (Christian Bale) works and its where his father worked. But the availability of cheap Chinese steel threatens to close down the place in a town that can ill afford another blow. Rodney (Casey Affleck) Russells younger brother has so far avoided life toiling in the mill by joining the Army. Hes done three tours of Iraq and now hes going to be stop-lossed for a fourth. The war has left him hollowed out by what he has seen and presumably by what hes done though he doesnt share much more than a shell-shocked silence. He cant find peace anywhere especially not at home. He has fallen into underground fighting winning small purses in an attempt to pay off low-level hood John Petty (Willem Dafoe). Russell bails him out secretly too. Its a tough life and its going to get worse. A drunken mistake lands Russell in jail for a few years. When he gets out he gets his old job back but hes lost his girlfriend (Zoe Saldana) who is now with the town sheriff (Forest Whitaker). Rodney meanwhile is back from his fourth tour and more desperate than ever. He begs Petty to get him into a bigger fight run by Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) an out-and-out crazy hillbilly who runs a grimy little drug and bare-knuckle fiefdom in the New Jersey woods. We know DeGroat is bad news from the start of the film when he assaults his date at a drive-in movie and throttles the man in the neighboring car who tries to come to her aid. Like everything else in the film he goes from bad to worse as practically every character in the film will learn. If you look back over that list of names you cant help but be impressed. And every one of them gives at the least a good performance; Bale and especially Affleck approach greatness. (Some will say the same of Harrelson who is indeed good but a little too over the top to be believable.) But ""Out of the Furnace"" winds up being more about moments between the actors than anything else. Despite Coopers attempts to make a statement about the faltering economy and its effects what we remember are scenes like the one in which the mostly silent Rodney finally faces off literally with his brother; Affleck is astonishing. Or when the recently freed Russell finally sees his girlfriend. Bales reactions are heartbreaking. Theres also a lack of subtlety like when the Maze boys uncle (Sam Shepard) cleaning a deer is juxtaposed with hunting of a more disturbing sort. If there is a point to be made Cooper tries to make it with a sledgehammer. In that respect ""Out of the Furnace"" begins to resemble one of those pedestrian revenge thrillers with really good acting. This is not to say that there isnt a great movie to be made about the brutalizing effects of the failure of towns and cities of hopes and dreams. There is. There has to be. But ""Out of the Furnace"" for all its virtues isnt quite it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Out of the Furnace movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Out of the Furnace Revenge tale fueled by strong cast  1/2December 05 2013|Michael PhillipsChristian Bale and Casey Affleck in ""Out of the Furnace."" (Kerry Hayes/Relativity Media)""Out of the Furnace"" is a lot of movie a lot of it good and pungent.In the first hour especially its many moving parts keep a sprawling ensemble cast busy and engaged. Christian Bale and Casey Affleck play Russell and Rodney sons of a dying Pennsylvania steelworker. Russell has gone into the family business working in the mill. Rodney enlists in the Army. The year is 2008. An early twist of fate lands Russell in prison. Upon his release he and his brother back from a punishing fourth tour of duty in Iraq must learn to adjust to new versions of their old lives.Russells ex-girlfriend played by Zoe Saldana now goes around with the mild-mannered local sheriff (Forest Whitaker). Rodney tries to work off his gambling debts (Willem Dafoe plays his bookie) by bare-knuckle boxing in the realm of a vicious New Jersey backwoods gang headed up by Woody Harrelson. Everyone in Braddock Pa. and environs knows everyone elses business and in some cases they know theyd better keep quiet about it.Writer-director Scott Coopers debut feature was the simple satisfying country ballad ""Crazy Heart"" and if that Jeff Bridges showcase operated like a three-minute song expanded into a full-length movie ""Out of the Furnace"" is more like a mournful Springsteen album reimagined for the movies. The film opens with a grim prologue barely related to the stories to come. Were in a drive-in and the Harrelson character commits an act of sexual violence so rough it risks throwing people straight out of the movie. Its effective in one way certainly It establishes the casual venality of the storys chief adversary a meth-addled sociopath thriving in a tough economy where honest workers have criminally few options.In its setting and portraits of machismo under duress ""Out of the Furnace"" recalls the home front sequences of ""The Deer Hunter."" The actors clearly are enjoying one anothers screen company. Sam Shepard is also in the cast as the brothers wise old uncle who joins Russell in his search for the brother who messes with the wrong criminal element.There is an oddly frustrating showdown at the end of the scripts increasingly familiar predictable and wearying path. Coopers strength as a writer lies in creating dramatic situations in which there is no simple matter of right or wrong at stake; often its a matter of two rights. So why does the picture settle in the end for good-versus-evil revenge? Audiences demand such things I suppose. But audiences are open to other sorts of depictions of the American working class. They simply need some help finding movies that come and go in a flash such as the recent ambitious ""Place Beyond the Pines"" which married melodrama with sociology in ways ""Out of the Furnace"" cannot reach.Its the little things we take home with us such as the handwritten menu above the bar in the local tavern (""We Have a New Fried Hot Sausage Sandwich""). The big things such as the cross-cutting between a deer hunt and the grisly demise of a major character betray a heavy hand. Yet Affleck in particular finds something fierce and noble in uneven material and in his characters rage. Hes not like any other actor in American movies.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Rocking a scraggly patch of facial hair a rotating wardrobe of sleeveless tees and a perpetual sneer Woody Harrelson cuts a mean figure in Out Of The Furnace. Like really mean His character a ruthless New Jersey psychopath named Harlan DeGroat is introduced in the opening scene doing with a hotdog what Matthew McConaughey did with fried chicken in Killer Joe. By starting the movie with this act of showy barbarism writer-director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) stops just short of painting a big target on his villains back. The next two hours will be a death march to comeuppance a feature-length game of waiting for the other shoe to drop. Some might call that fatalism but here it plays an awful lot like spinning wheels kicking up lots of muck but going nowhere fast. Out Of The Furnace turns out to be a predictable very ordinary retribution story propped up by slumming A-listers and a gritty veneer of Rust Belt desperation. The film is set mainly in the smoggy depressed steel town of Braddock Pennsylvania which seems to have as many railroad crossings as street corners and whose gray skies are made grayer by the endless billow of factory fumes. Cooper a dedicated chronicler of dead-end lives has a feel for this kind of colorfully colorless environment. But all that smoke and grime cant disguise the archetypal thinness of his characterizations. Hes dressed down a cliched genre exercise to look like a bleeding-heart vision of economic despair. Back in morose serious-guy mode Christian Bale plays Russell Baze a Bruce Springsteen song personified. When not working at the old steel mill or doing hard time for a hard-luck crime hes mourning the true love (Zoe Saldana) he lost to the local lawman (Forest Whitaker). Russells also got a dying dad and most problematically a hothead younger brother Rodney Jr. (Casey Affleck) who cant seem to stay out of trouble. A bitter war veteran who some saw shit Rodney boxes to make ends meet but is too proud to take a dive when hes supposed to. Chasing a big payout he coerces his reluctant manager (Willem Dafoe) to get him in with Harrelsons notorious promoter. As famous last words go ""one last fight"" is about as ominous as ""one last score."" Historical-fiction fans could be excused for thinking at glance that Cooper had adapted Thomas Bells 1941 immigrant saga Out Of This Furnace which was also set in Braddock. The parallels while doubtlessly intentional are misleading Coopers interest in an ailing America is chiefly cosmetic; the struggles of ex-convicts returning soldiers and working-class Joes are given cursory treatment to add a little sociological flavor to the inevitable score-settling badassery. That the movie treats its Pennsylvanians like noble victims of the system while their dirt-poor Jersey counterparts are basically hillbilly bogeymen suggests that Coopers empathy is regionally specific. Sometimes resembling a cross between Winters Bone and Warrior--but without the stylized language of the former or the male-weepie conviction of the latter--Out Of The Furnace gets by on the commitment of its cast. Bale makes the most of an underwritten part brooding magnificently until it comes time to get his hands dirty while Affleck invests his role with his usual volatile vulnerability. Harrelson meanwhile turns ""candy suckling"" into the new ""mustache twirling."" Hes the cartoonish and despicable heavy this glorified B-movie deserves. ""Am I supposed to be scared of him because he sucks on a lollipop?"" Rodney asks in the films most self-aware moment. The answer of course is yes though having a character actually acknowledge the silliness makes it go down a little smoother.

(Kerry Hayes) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday December 3 2013 1100 AM Title Out of the Furnace Film Info With Christian Bale Casey Affleck Zoe Saldana Willem Dafoe and Woody Harrelson. A bond between brothers is set against the violence and hardship of Rust Belt America. Director Scott Cooper (146). R Violence language sexuality. Area theaters. Day-to-day struggle is the engine inside director Scott Coopers intense raw drama ""Out of the Furnace."" It certainly defines Russell Baze (Christian Bale) a thirtyish Pennsylvania steel-mill worker who chose the same tough life as his father. Yet the one lived by his brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) isnt easier. Rodney an Army vet has re-upped for a third tour in Iraq despite the toll its taken on him. After Russell kills a motorist in a drunk-driving incident hes sent to prison. When he gets out he finds that his girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana) is dating the police chief (Forest Whitaker) his father has died and Rodney is a hollowed-out shell. To make matters worse Rodney in debt to a bookie (Willem Dafoe) has agreed to enter bare-knuckle brawls near the New Jersey border a place thats under the scary control of an unhinged wild man named Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson). Woody Harrelson and Willem Dafoe in ""Out of the Furnace"" (Kerry Hayes) The setting of ""Furnace"" is as hard-etched as its characters. Mountains loom in the background but more prominent are the hardscrabble towns and ramshackle homes hunkering in their shadow. Cooper whose  ""Crazy Heart"" (2010) had a similar affinity for shaggy outsiders maintains a heated naturalistic feel though his and Brad Ingelsbys script does fold a few corners too neatly. Casey Affleck and Christian Bale in ""Out of the Furnace"" (Courtesy of Relativity Media) Yet like ""The Deer Hunter"" -- from which it swipes its Keystone State milieu its haunted veterans its self-endangerment metaphor and a crucial central image -- ""Out of the Furnace"" gets under your skin. Bales commitment etches a raw portrait of stagnation and sadness. Affleck is heartbreakingly feral and Dafoe Harrelson and Whitaker provide solid support. Zoe Saldana stars as Lena Taylor in ""Out of the Furnace."" (Kerry Hayes) Saldanas scenes are brief yet she give the good-hearted Lena a glow. She clearly comes from some other gentler place Russell and Rodney cant reach. The place theyinhabit is glimpsed in the films gripping opening frames As Harrelsons Harlan sits at a drive-in the woman hes with sets off his hair-trigger temper. He becomes abusive and when a bystander intervenes Harlan sees that as an invitation to pulverize the guy. At that point we dont where we are yet but we sure as hell dont want to be stuck there.

"Review Out of the Furnace a big missed opportunity - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Out of the Furnace a big missed opportunityBy Tony Hicksthicksbayareanewsgroup.comPosted 12/04/2013 120000 PM PSTUpdated 12/04/2013 043334 PM PST Related StoriesDec 4In Out of the Furnace Casey Affleck reveals another facet of his talent""Out of the Furnace"" is a visually striking film. It makes you feel chilled to the bone not only by the Rust Belt Pennsylvania setting but with its dark and violent subject matter. The acting of Christian Bale and Casey Affleck is superb and Woody Harrelson obviously has come a long way from doofus bartender on ""Cheers"" to one of the best sneering bad guys in Hollywood. And the supporting cast is first-rate.So what happened?It feels like someone -- director Scott Cooper co-wrote the film with Brad Ingelsby and Ridley Scott produced it -- opted to take the path of least resistance here with a story that lacks any real surprises and fails to fully explore some of the meaty themes it touches on.""Furnace"" is about a pair of blue-collar brothers steelworker Russell Baze (Bale) and just-returned Iraq War veteran Rodney Baze Jr. (Affleck). Rodney is trying to get by with bare-knuckle boxing matches in lieu of getting a job at the steel mill which he blames for their fathers death. He gets in deep with a local bookie (played by the always intense Willem Dafoe) and in a desperate move heads to fight in rural New Jersey where the action is run by Curtis DeGroat (a sleazy and just-crazy-enough Harrelson). Rodney disappears and local police seem helpless to do anything about it (Forest Whitaker plays the local police chief in a role too small for his talent) prompting Russell to take matters into his own hands.Advertisement Set in 2008 ""Furnace"" features acting good enough that you actually can feel the misery in which the characters are drenched. Affleck is occasionally explosive especially in a scene where he talks about his experiences overseas. But the performances (highlighted by plenty of close-ups and a minimal amount of intrusive music) the stark scenery and the effective dark mood cant stop the film from going on autopilot at the point in which Russell decides to go save his brother. The plot from there goes straight where one would expect without a twist or turn in sight. Opportunities to dig into topics such as post-traumatic stress disorder and the shrinking blue-collar American landscape are wasted. Even the early relationship between Russell and Lena (Zoe Saldana) which ends when Russell goes to prison after a fatal DUI accident feels underexplored.Bug-eyed Harrelson owns the screen whenever he appears a wild contrast to the brooding cool Bale (who is nothing less than his usual convincing self). But Harrelsons strong performance also highlights the holes in his characters back story. How did he come to rule his fighting/meth-dealing empire? How did he come to be the way he is? (The movies stunningly violent opening scene during which DeGroat shows that he doesnt do dating very well explains a little of this.)There are a couple moments near the end when theres just enough suspense to make you briefly hold your breath.

Or who felt the most got done at meetings -- and inevitably promoted the employees who loyally showed up? Its no different in Hollywood. People value their own strengths -- and fall back on them once they get a new job. Screenwriters who become directors emphasize story and character; former cinematographers cling to images; former editors action and pace. And actors? Actors who end up directing other actors -- well they love giving actors lots of ""moments."" Scott Cooper used to be an actor and then he got behind the camera and made ""Crazy Heart"" with Jeff Bridges. Now hes followed it up with ""Out of the Furnace"" and its got quite a cast -- Christian Bale Casey Affleck Woody Harrelson Willem Dafoe Sam Shepard Forest Whitaker and diluting the testosterone overload a bit Zoe Saldana. But while the movies sure got a lot of good moments Im not sure they add up to a good movie. The picture is set mostly in the Pennsylvania rust-belt town of Braddock and partly in New Jerseys Ramapo Mountains which were told often are full of crazy criminal ""inbreds."" Meth is a big staple there it seems. So are illegal bare-knuckle bouts. Its an ugly world but theres money and it pulls in Dafoe and Affleck who head up into the hills on some business. Then things go really really wrong thanks to natural-born crazy Harrelson. And so its time for Bale and Shepard to put things right. ""Out of the Furnace"" is a handsome-looking movie -- Cooper has some wonderful shots of gorgeously decrepit steel mills and extravagantly dilapidated houses -- but I think there was a line in the budget for ""pretense misc."" Or there should have been. There is for example a long exaggeratedly crosscut sequence that parallels Affleck going up for a fight with Bale and Shepard going after a deer. Plenty of tattoos -- rosaries military insignias obscenities -- that tell you exactly what to think about a character. Lots of closeups of people staring off into space. N.J. NEWS ON THE GO Our redesigned mobile site has quick page loads and app-style navigation and lets you join the conversation with comments and social media. Visit NJ.com from any mobile browser. And since Cooper is an actor his movie is all about making room for acting. Both Bale and Affleck get some showy shouting scenes where they get to break things or bellow; as a police chief Whitaker tries a new gruff voice. Doing the most scene-study work is Harrelson who plays a sadistic woman-beating psycho. Of course out of all these melodramatic performances its the quietest one that really connects -- Shepards taciturn deer-hunting old uncle. His character disappears towards the movies end and thats too bad; after this and ""Mud"" its clear that if you ever got into real trouble Shepard is the sort of man youd want at your back. But as overly appreciative as Cooper is of actors (and a little too often of Acting with a capital A) and as beautifully as ""Out of the Furnace"" is shot it still plays like a mostly prettied-up programmer -- well cast and budgeted to be sure but obvious and unsurprising and not that different from any number of cheaper simpler films. For fans who need a bit of gloss to justify their thrills -- who need some self-conscious art to make them feel theyre watching something serious and important and Oscar-worthy instead of just thrilling and violent and entertaining -- ""Out of the Furnace"" may fit the bill. But somehow a little movie like ""Homefront"" feels a lot more honest -- about what it is who its for and how it delivers. Ratings note The film contains violence substance abuse and strong language. Out of the Furnace (R) Relativity (116 min.) Directed by Scott Cooper. With Christian Bale Casey Affleck Woody Harrelson.

Decent guy Russell (Christian Bale) has one of the last remaining jobs at the mill but a cataclysmic car accident and his incarceration put brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) a scarred Iraqi vet under too much pressure. Gambling and bare-knuckle brawling draw the latter into the glare of a ferocious meth dealer (Woody Harrelson). As if all of this werent sufficiently upsetting Pearl Jams ""Release"" wails at films start and end like a dirge. After Coopers Crazy Heart its gratifying to see a director further commit himself to dead-end career anxieties--even if Out of the Furnace goes beyond the edge of poetic despair into stridency. The movie becomes too finely focused on Old Testament payback losing a bit of dignity in the process. But subtle performances--especially from Bale and Affleck both growing meaner in the absence of hope--transcend any structural weaknesses. The bottom drops out early for them but their endgame is savagely captivating.

Out of the Furnace Movie Review (2013) | Roger Ebert,http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/out-of-the-furnace-2013,200,outofthefurnace32,outofthefurnace,rogerebert
"Review Out of the Furnace beautifully captures bare-knuckle lives - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review Out of the Furnace beautifully captures bare-knuckle lives Rejection in Hollywood can be infamous. We recap a few of Tinseltowns well-known roles that were initially or eventually offered to others. By Christy Khoshaba (By Christy Khoshaba) Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic There is an unnerving moment deep inside the working-class drama ""Out of the Furnace"" when a primal scream cuts short an old argument between two brothers. Ripped from the emotional core of the younger a burned-out Army soldier Rodney Baze played by Casey Affleck it is frustration made manifest -- a wordless rage against the death of the American dream.Painful searing eloquent it puts the films central themes of ordinary folks weathering the worst of times in sharp relief. As he will throughout older brother Russell absorbs it bears the unbearable does not look away. Christian Bale as Russell creates one of those stoically decent men forged in the foundries of the Rust Belt forgotten in a postindustrial age. But then ""Out of the Furnace"" is rich in talent used wisely. Woody Harrelson Zoe Saldana Willem Dafoe Forest Whitaker and Sam Shepard help to create a sinewy portrait of a dying way of life.VIDEO Watch Out of the Furnace cast crew discuss film Director Scott Cooper whose 2009 critically acclaimed ""Crazy Heart"" examined the wasted days and nights of a washed-up country singer has chosen to pick at another thread of social dysfunction in ""Out of the Furnace."" The lean script which he wrote with Brad Ingelsby gives a face to the all-too-familiar story of economic decline and its effect on those already living on the margins.Though the blue-collar Baze brothers are the visceral spine of this film it begins and ends with a backwoods meth kingpin named Harlan Degroat whom Harrelson takes to terrifying extremes. The opening scene at a drive-in is so brutal so senseless it creates an undercurrent of tension and dread that never leaves the film. The narrative swings between Braddock Pa. the struggling steel town where the Baze family lives and New Jersey hill country where life is defined by entrenched poverty drugs alcohol bare-knuckle fighting and Degroat. That the brothers lives will intersect in harrowing ways with Degroats is only one of several tragic twists of fate the film has in store.Bale Affleck and Harrelson are in their element as men battered by life delivering exceptional performances that hold nothing back. Bale and Affleck are as nuanced as Harrelson is unhinged. It is among the finest work done by all three.The film opens in 2008 on the eve of Barack Obamas presidential nomination along with its promise of change. Rodney is back from a tour in Iraq racking up gambling debts trying to pay them off with bare-knuckle fights put together by his bookie John Petty (Dafoe). Russell spends his days working the steel mill blast furnaces. Hes fallen in love with Lena (Saldana) and dreams of a future and a family. With their dad bedridden their uncle Red (Shepard) steps into the patriarch role. On the set movies and TVCooper sets a very deliberate pace taking his time to move the story forward several years as Russell and Rodney are each forced to deal with a series of bad choices. It will include prison time for Russell and more of Iraq for Rodney. The film ultimately turns on Rodneys disappearance into the bare-knuckle circuit that Degroat runs in the Ramapo Mountains and Russells determination to set things right.For all the violence -- and this is a brutal film -- there is a stirring tenderness of tough men tucked into the creases. A kiss on the head of a failing father orchids tended by hardscrabble hands the details of real life real strife beautifully captured. A steady stream of irony slips in too the way Cooper plays images off each other always leaves room for interpretation -- Rodney taking a beating in a fixed fight Russell and Red miles away skinning the deer newly brought down.The film was shot on location in Braddock and from the factory to the streets the authenticity lends a texture to the imagery that echoes Dorothea Langes Depression-era photographs. A long-vacated factory provides an eerie backdrop for the penultimate face-off between Russell and Degroat.Cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi captures the contrasts as the film shifts between the languishing town and the natural beauty of rural Pennsylvania and New Jersey. It is all set to the backwoods chords of ""Winters Bone"" composer Dickon Hinchliffe with Eddie Vedder contributing a poignant new rendition of the Pearl Jam hit ""Release.""PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie clubBale in particular moves with such grace within the tableau and the loose narrative of the film. A world of worn-down weariness to be found in his thousand-yard stares.Much is left unsaid unexplained. Scenes sometimes move from one moment to the next at other times entire years pass unmarked unmentioned. The technique lends an out-of-time feel to the film; instead of quick cuts Cooper often lingers. Sometimes it works sometimes its disorienting. But the slow pull of the performances stand in opposition to the rising tension to nice effect. Vengeance when it comes brings resolution but no release.""Out of the Furnace"" is not an easy film almost as rough on the psyche as the fights Rodney gets into. Its as unrelenting as the tough times it portrays. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com --------------------------- Out of the FurnaceMPAA rating R for strong violence language and drug content.Running time 1 hour 56 minutesPlaying At Arclight Hollywood; Landmark Theatre West Los Angeles PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Out of the Furnace Christian Bale Woody Harrelson Casey Affleck Reviews Out of the Furnace Christian Bale on loving enough to let go Out of the Furnace Christian Bales gut feeling about the role Out of the Furnace Christian Bale on not calling action Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad76deg","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-out-of-the-furnace-review-20131204,0,4155872.story#axzz2mSpcVGEt",200,outofthefurnace33,outofthefurnace,latimes

When Rodney gets caught up with the wrong crowd of criminals and goes missing Russell will stop at nothing to find him. Claudia Puig USA TODAY 6 p.m. EST December 3 2013Its a raw tense and bleak ensemble drama set in a dying corner of America.Christian Bale stars in the neo-noir thriller Out of the Furnace.(Photo Kerry Hayes Relativity Media)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Christian Bale Casey Affleck Zoe Saldana Sam Shepard Willem Dafoe Woody HarrelsonRated R; Runtime 1 hour 56 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideChristian Bale takes an extreme path as his brothers keeper in the melancholy and haunting Out of the Furnace.Bale plays Russell Baze a caring loyal and decent man whose ordinary life spirals dramatically downward as he stolidly protects his lost soul of a brother Rodney (Casey Affleck). The chemistry between Bale and Affleck is powerful intensifying the credibility of their brotherly bond.Bales is a pitch-perfect understated performance in this involving neo-noir thriller ( out of four; rated R; opens Wednesday in New York and Los Angeles and Friday nationwide). Just as impressive -- and blood-curdling -- is the menacing performance by Woody Harrelson as Harlan DeGroat a vicious meth-dealer hillbilly with whom Russell and Rodney tangle.Director Scott Cooper (Crazy Heart) presents familiar themes but takes them in unpredictable directions.Set among the working class of a rusting Pennsylvania steel town the story initially shows Russell enjoying his romance with Lena (Zoe Saldana) despite his dead-end job at the local mill. Hes a dutiful son sweetly loving to his terminally ill father (Bingo OMalley).Rodney ever sad-eyed is another story. He wants no part of the working-class mill life that his father and brother chose. An Army veteran about to be sent on his fourth tour in Iraq Rodney is haunted by his experiences. Determined to make some quick money he gets caught up in off-track betting and bare-knuckle boxing. Things spiral downward from there.The film is strikingly shot. A stark look pervades the blue-collar world the brothers inhabit heightening the sense of realism. Moral relativism is also a large part of the chilly tale. Rodneys rage is just below the surface ready to flare at the slightest provocation. Russell is steady and even-tempered. Until hes not.When Rodney disappears after heading off to New Jersey with an oddly paternal small-time bookie appropriately named Petty (Willem Dafoe) Russell is frustrated by the foot-dragging of local lawmen. All illicit roads seem to lead back to Harlan whose notoriously long gun-toting arm reaches from his backwoods New Jersey crack house to the brothers small Pennsylvania town and beyond. Based on the first off-putting scene in which Harlan is featured its clear hes more than an inbred bad guy. Hes pretty much evil incarnate.Harrelsons merciless glare leaves a searing impression. His malevolent persona is terrifying but the script never bothers to explain -- or even hint at -- what has made Harlan so unhinged.Meanwhile Russells girlfriend has dumped him for the towns by-the-book sheriff Chief Wesley Barnes (Forest Whitaker) who offers a steadier if less passionate life.The dark story in some ways recalls the grim mood of Michael Ciminos The Deer Hunter with the shadow of the Vietnam War updated to the Iraq War here. Bale gives one of his best performances and Harrelson and Affleck are completely captivating.Supporting roles by Saldana Whitaker and Sam Shepard as Russell and Rodneys stoic uncle are also convincing making for a raw tense and bleak ensemble drama. 14 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1cTGombHoliday Movie Calendar DecemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this December complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

The life of Russell Baze a steelworker in a Pennsylvania town just outside of Pittsburgh may be drab and dreary but hes a good hardworking man with a loving girlfriend. His younger brother Rodney has it tougher A war vet suffering from PTSD he hasnt been able to readjust to life at home falling in with the local thugs and turning to bare-knuckle brawling to make a little scratch. Disaster strikes when Russell goes to prison on a drunk-driving charge -- there the only shiny thing in his life is the razor wire unspooled atop the prison walls. By the time hes released hes lost his girlfriend and his brother has burrowed deeper into a life of trouble. As always Russell acts responsibly -- until hes pushed to the limit. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - If that were the plot of a drive-in movie of the 70s you might actually want to see it -- its a basic but sturdy idea that could have some juice. As it is its the story director Scott Cooper tells in his somber drama Out of the Furnace and he squeezes precious few droplets of energy out of it. The picture is earnest to a fault coming off like an exploration of how ""the little people"" live so carefully written that it veritably trumpets how remote it is from the grittiness of its subject matter. You can almost hear the gears humming Out of the Furnace is calibrated to move us which isnt the same as drawing us invisibly and quietly into its world.The paradox of overwritten movies like Out of the Furnace is that they often provide good showcases for actors. Cooper previously made 2009s Crazy Heart casting Jeff Bridges as a faded country star -- his performance was a thing of grizzled beauty. In Out of the Furnace Cooper chosen his actors with obvious care Christian Bale plays the dutiful Russell; Casey Affleck is the wayward Rodney. Willem Dafoe shows up as a small-town crime kingpin. Woody Harrelson is a tattooed goon from the remote Ramapo Mountains in the movies terms a ""dont go thar"" place if ever there was one. Zoe Saldana has the thankless role of the sweet girlfriend though she adds more layers of subtlety than many actresses could. And Sam Shepard shows up for his 10 or so minutes of screentime which seems to be the norm for him these days. (If only we could see more of him.)Film Details Out of the Furnace RatingR GenreDrama Running Time116 More Info Trailer Cooper who co-wrote the script with Brad Ingelsby seems to understand the things actors want out of roles. Maybe thats one way he gets the best out of them particularly in the case of Affleck. Even in some of his acclaimed performances -- like the one he gave in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford -- Affleck often gives off the aura of trying too hard albeit in his characteristically laid-back way. But here with his watery colorless voice and zonked-out gaze he makes an extremely believable lost soul -- you can see why Russell would strive to protect him. But the performance is even more interesting for the sparks of defiance Affleck shoots into it. The more Russell tries to coddle Rodney the surlier he becomes. His pride is muddled and ultimately defeated by his aimlessness.But its Bale whos most surprising. Typically hes a conscientious thoughtful actor -- maybe too thoughtful as evidenced by the way his veins throb in his temples throughout those stolid boring Batman performances. Hes so intense he can even control the rate at which blood flows through his body. But oddly enough even in this very serious-minded role hes much looser and more relaxed than usual. His scenes with Saldana are the finest He may be a heavily tattooed working guy hardened by the usual life struggles but his tenderness with her makes him seem almost fragile a garden flower with muscles. In these moments hes more like the old Bale the one who was so extraordinary and perceptive in Gillian Armstrongs 1994 Little Women. Cooper may have gone overboard in delineating the hardships of blue-collar life in Out of the Furnace. But he has a gift for getting actors to put some muscle into their work and enough finesse to make sure the sweat doesnt show.2 Woody Harrelson in Out of the Furnace.

Photo Kerry Hayes/AP MOVIE REVIEW Out of the Furnace As subtle as a blowtorch. Running time 116 minutes. Rated R (graphic violence profanity drugs). Opens Wednesday at the Lincoln Square and Sunshine; wide on Friday. A testosterone-drenched Oscar-baiting homage to 70s cinema with a heavyweight cast Scott Coopers ""Out of the Furnace is much longer on style and belligerence than actual substance. Christian Bale and Casey Affleck play Russell and Rodney Baze ill-fated blue-collar brothers in a Pennsylvania Rust Belt town. Its 2008 and Russell (Bale) who works in the local steel mill gets sent to prison after he kills a man in a drunk-driving accident. When he gets out four years later Russell manages to get his old job back but its clear the mill may not be operating much longer. Younger brother Rodney (Affleck) a war veteran is suffering from post-traumatic stress after four tours in Iraq. Without Russell to help out financially during his incarceration Rodney gets so far behind in his gambling debts to sleazy bookie Petty (Willem Dafoe) that hes been paying them off by competing in bare-knuckle fights. Much to Russells alarm Rodney begs Petty to get him into a big match sponsored by New Jersey hillbilly meth dealer DeGroat (Woody Harrelson). DeGroat does not react well when the fighters dont follow his scripts for the fixed matches -- a problem for Rodney. We discover what kind of murderous mayhem DeGroat is capable of right from the films opening scene where he shoves a hot dog down the throat of his date at a drive-in movie -- and reduces a bystander whos unwise enough to try and come to her rescue to a bloody pulp. Theres not much in the way of surprises in the doom- and foreboding-laden script by Cooper and Brad Ingelsby which has nothing especially profound to say about the fate of returning veterans or people facing the loss of manufacturing jobs. Except that their prospects like the characters in this movie are bleak. The little-known and insular multiracial subculture in the Ramapo Mountains adjoining an affluent section of North Jersey -- where an armed Russell goes searching for Rodney after the match -- might have made for an interesting movie. But the filmmakers exploit it strictly for local color. Specifically the color red. Cooper who directed Jeff Bridges to a surprise Best Actor Oscar for ""Crazy Heart for the most part encourages the actors -- especially Harrelson -- to chew the beautifully photographed scenery. Shouting his lines with choked anger Affleck hasnt been this mannered -- and frankly annoying -- since ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford which somehow brought him a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for that little-seen Western. Sam Shepard as the brothers taciturn uncle and Forest Whitaker -- as the police chief who married Russells ex-girlfriend while he was in prison -- are on hand strictly to lend gravitas to a film thats already extremely heavy going. Zoe Saldana has little to do in the thankless role of the ex-girlfriend who is off-screen for most of the film. Bale who can overact with the best of them uncharacteristically underplay Russell -- and it works with so much hamming going on around him. Too bad his character like everyone elses is so thinly written. ""Out of the Furnace is obsessed with a certain Oscar-winning Best Picture from 1978 with which it shares a Pennsylvania setting. It even throws in a gratuitous deer-hunting scene -- just in case anyone misses the homage.

""Out of the Furnace"" is the exception that disproves the rule. It has three great scenes and no bad ones per se but has wall-to-wall flat ones. This culminates in a picture that would have been modest in success at best but ends up uninteresting and forgettable in its current state. ""Out of the Furnace"" is no disaster but it doesnt achieve what it hopes to achieve and it has no one to blame but itself. First the good stuff ""Out of the Furnace"" has a pre-title sequence wherein Woody Harrelson does with a hot dog what Matthew McConaughey does with a chicken leg in ""Killer Joe."" It isnt quite as disgusting but the movies only beginning you know? The act of debasement happens at a drive-in and when someone in the next car sees Harrelson smacking a woman around he tries to intervene. Harrelson reveals himself to be a crazed violent monster and the scene is shot from behind with the wide movie proscenium creating a screencap-ready juxtaposition (some research revealed the projected film to be ""Midnight Meat Train""). Its creepy and scary and it all looks really cool. The second great scene is a sibling argument between Christian Bale and Casey Affleck soon after the death of their father. Bale is the hard-working hump at a Pennsylvania steel mill just released from prison for involuntary manslaughter. Hes got no prospects but at least his heads screwed on straight. Affleck is the typical hot-headed brother whose drive for a quick buck always spells doom in these blue collar tales. Hes just back from another tour in Iraq and after some needling from Bale pulls back a bit of the PTSD curtain hes been living behind. In three or four lines of descriptive dialogue he reminds us that no one who hasnt been there has a right to judge anyone whos cleaned up piles of blasted limbs. The final great scene is when Bale has a heart-to-heart with his ex-girlfriend Zoe Saldana. Prior to the drunk driving accident that sent him to jail they were happy and thinking of starting a family. She got together with someone else while he was on the inside (Forest Whitaker) and as the former flames make polite conversation (on a camera-friendly footbridge in the center of an economically desolate downtown) she confesses that she is pregnant. Bale is devastated but he is also happy for her. His reaction a flood of conflicting untidy and uncontainable emotion show as they say in the biz ""good choices."" Bales performance in the rest of the movie is ho-hum but thats because the character and the movie itself is ultimately boring. But these three seconds are electric and almost worth the price of admission. Unfortunately the rest of the movie doesnt want to deal too much with the theme that drives these moments. Director/co-writer is content to just leave them there at the edges because he (unwisely) thinks hes got a great crime yarn to spin. This is alas not the case. The bulk of ""Out of the Furnace"" is a dull seen-it-a-million-times story of small time hoods getting in too deep with maniac baddies. The straight and narrow guy (in this case Bale) is forced by The Gritty Movie Code to enact vengeance and that means running around abandoned industrial landscapes with a shotgun. Snooze. ""Out of the Furnace"" is an odd duck because theres little that stands out as a particularly offensive element. In fact there are several small niceties that pop up. Willem Dafoe may be the most caring gangster in cinema. I mean he still demands of you the money you owe him but worries a little if you decide to pay back with winnings from dangerous bare-knuckle fights. On the other hand this may be the first movie in which a major plot point is derived from an errant butt-dial. Nevertheless when the movie concludes (and Pearl Jams anthemic ""Release"" brays over the credits) the overwhelming feeling is one of waste. Good performers picturesque setting characters with potential - but unfortunately no real story to tell.

TWITTER Christian Bale Woody Harrelson Casey Affleck and Forest Whitaker star in Scott Coopers drama. The sad gray economically parched Rust Belt setting is familiar from numerous fine recent films -- The Fighter Warrior Unstoppable Prisoners-- and another solid one joins the list with Out of the Furnace. Director/co-writer Scott Coopers second feature shares a similar melancholy end-of-the-line tone with his first Crazy Heart while examining another part of the country that would seem to offer no hope of a better life to its residents short of escape. This well-wrought rather prosaic working-class drama about two brothers whose dwindling prospects tilt them toward the overlapping criminal worlds of drugs and bare-fisted boxing looks to ride its volatile cast and violent tendencies to moderate box-office results. A startling opening scene serves notice that some nasty business lies ahead. After a hopped-up hillbilly played by Woody Harrelson at full tilt shoves a hot dog down the throat of his date at a drive-in movie (do they still have those in backwoods Pennsylvania?) he beats the absolute crap out of a gentleman who presumes to come to the distressed womans assistance. After an entrance like this audiences would cry foul if this psycho didnt dish out even more irrational violence later on. You can rest assured he delivers. PHOTOS 25 of Falls Most Anticipated Movies Set in 2008 -- as evidenced by a TV clip of Ted Kennedy enthusing about Barack Obama at the Democratic convention -- the central focus of the script by Brad Ingelsby and the director is the downward-spiraling lives of the Baze brothers Russell (Christian Bale) and Rodney (Casey Affleck). While their dad is expiring from cancer Russell works at a mill that doesnt figure to be around much longer while Rodney accumulates gambling debts between multiple tours of duty in Iraq. Things go from bad to worse when Russell does a stretch in prison for negligence in a fatal auto accident. By the time he gets out his girl Lena (Zoe Saldana) has taken up with the sheriff (Forest Whitaker) while Rodney has begun trying to pay back what he owes to local bookie Petty (Willem Dafoe) by participating in illegal bare-knuckle fights that have all the savoriness of cockfighting contests. The impresario of such events which are staged in remote abandoned factories is none other than Harrelsons Harlan DeGroat the territorys most notorious and elusive drug producer dealer and never to be outdone user. He does not take kindly to being crossed nor does he appreciate it when Rodney forgets to throw a fight hes supposed to. When in an early encounter Russell asks Harlan if he has a problem with him DeGroat replies ""I got a problem with everybody."" PHOTOS The Christian Bale Directors Posse 6 Auteurs Won Over By the Actor The dark and dangerous road this deterministic drama takes predictably leads to places so bad theyre not on any map and this is the type of literal-minded film that intercuts between two hunters stalking shooting and dressing a deer and the deadly pursuit of a human being. Once at least a couple of important characters have had the bad luck to encounter Mr. DeGroat one too many times its quite clear that the missing second half of the titular proverb ""Out of the furnace ..."" will be fulfilled. DeGroat serves a function very close to the Kurtz character in Heart of Darkness and Apocalypse Now as an embodiment of pure and irredeemable evil the king of a jungle so far off any normal moral or geographic map that everyday law enforcement wont even venture there. It takes a loner to stalk the beast in his own territory which is where the film ultimately travels. But there is good character work along the way even if its more in the form of sketches than full-fledged portraits. Saldanas Lena is all bristling nerve endings and vibrantly available emotion. Afflecks four-tour Iraq vet is so accustomed to living on the edge and putting his life on the line that everything else seems boring. Owing money to DeGroat has made bookmaking far more perilous a profession for Dafoes wizened veteran than he ever bargained for. Shepard offers gravitas as the young mens uncle who knew Braddock Pennsylvania (where the film was made) when it was a thriving steel town rather than a depressing symbol of industrial and working class decay. Tom Bower projects the meek defeatedess of the go-along/get-along flunky. Whitaker actually has little to do other than to assert the parameters of his cops jurisdiction and fruitlessly advise Russell not to take on DeGroat. In the meaty bad guy role Harrelson entertainingly goes all the way putting him way out there on the ledge with any of your favorite loonies psychos and unhinged nutjobs; hes got something considerably more profane tattooed on his hands than Robert Mitchum did in The Night of the Hunter. VIDEO New Out of the Furnace Trailer Casey Affleck Falls in With a Dangerous Crowd Bale throws himself into his role earnestly and impressively. Russell sincerely wants to do the right thing--by his father his brother his girlfriend and his life. But the limitations constraints and possibilities for being tripped up in his attempt to do so are considerable even without a threat like DeGroat lurking about; one look at the town and you know theres little hope but Russell has assumed too many responsibilities to shirk them by leaving. In some things he can make a difference in others there is probably nothing anyone could do. Craft contributions combine with the vivid locations to create a strong sense of place.

The rusted-out soul of steel-town America and the ghosts of the 1970s post-Vietnam Hollywood cinema haunt Scott Coopers ""Out of the Furnace"" a starkly powerful drama that in some ways feels like an Iraq-era bookend to ""The Deer Hunter"" with bare-knuckle boxing substituted for Russian roulette. A much darker and less audience-friendly package than Coopers Oscar-winning 2009 debut ""Crazy Heart"" but graced by the same lyrical sense of worn-down American lives this slow-burning drama should earn deserved praise for the top-drawer performances of stars Christian Bale Casey Affleck and a truly frightening Woody Harrelson but will need a lot of TLC from distrib Relativity (which opens the pic wide on Dec. 6) to break out commercially in a very crowded holiday frame.This story first appeared in the November 12 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. The furnace of the title is literally the Carrie Furnace of Braddock Penn. the real Rust Belt town where Coopers pic is set. But it is also the fire that burns inside Rodney Baze (Affleck) a native son of Braddock who opted out of mill life the only way he could by joining the Army. There hes served three tours of duty in Iraq and is when the movie begins about to be ""stop-lossed"" into a fourth -- and one need look no further than Afflecks anguished gaze to know that Rodney has seen and done things that mark a man for the rest of his life. Rodneys more straight-arrow brother Russell (Bale) did go to work in the mill like their father before him and has one of the few remaining jobs there in lean economic times. The year is 2008 and the Obama election is playing out on TV but for places like Braddock the promise of ""change"" seems as empty as most of the storefronts along the main streets. And for much of the first hour of ""Out of the Furnace"" Cooper (who rewrote the script by Brad Inglesby) steeps us in the  dead-end mood of the place the off-track betting parlor where Rodney gambles away money borrowed from an avuncular barkeep and bookie (Willem Dafoe); the forlorn drive-in movie theater where a hair-trigger tweaker named Harlan DeGroat (Woody Harrelson) uncorks his rage on his unsuspecting girlfriend; and Carrie Furnace itself blackening the Braddock skies in a permanent veil of soot. Shot ""entirely and proudly"" (per the end credits) on 35mm Kodak film by the cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi (""The Grey"" ""Silver Linings Playbook"") the images have an ashen pallor that calls to mind William Blake and his ""dark Satanic mills."" Things happen in ""Out of the Furnace"" with the violent unpredictable force of life itself rather than the reassuring rhythms of most screenplays. First a late-night car accident lands Russell in jail on manslaughter charges during which enough time passes for Rodney to take his fourth tour in Iraq and for Russells girlfriend (Zoe Saldana) to leave him for the town sheriff (Forest Whitaker). The prison scenes carry their own brutal unsparing power and when Russell is finally released Bale plays the moment remarkably taking in a few deep breaths as if he were breathing air for the first time. These are the kind of small character-revealing moments that Cooper as he did in ""Crazy Heart"" supplies in spades. Affleck has a lean prowling intensity here as the combat vet who like the bomb-disposal ace paralyzed by the choices in a suburban supermarket in ""The Hurt Locker"" cannot easily readjust to civilian life. So Rodney finds himself drawn into the local bare-knuckle fight scene where the purses are low but the pain reliably numbing. And eventually he turns to Dafoe asking for an introduction to DeGroat and the higher-stakes fights he runs in the deep backwoods of neighboring New Jersey -- a decision that will come to bind all of these disparate characters in a cycle of tragedy and vengeance a war at home to rival the one abroad. Perhaps because he was originally an actor himself (""Gods and Generals"" ""Get Low"") Cooper seems to make actors feel safe and willing to expose themselves in ways they ordinarily might not and time and again he takes scenes to places of unexpected emotional power. Bale in particular has a series of strikingly fragile tender moments here forging an effortless brotherly bond with Affleck and playing a heartbreaking reunion scene with Saldana in which a lifetime of regrets and bad decisions seems to surge inside him. Harrelson is scarily effective as the movies hillbilly Walter White precisely because he never descends into the lip-smacking movie villainy always seeming -- like all of the characters in ""Out of the Furnace"" -- a product of his bleak environment. In their smaller roles Dafoe Whitaker and Sam Shepard (as the brothers grizzled uncle) all do sensitive affecting understated work. But unlike many actor-directors Cooper is an equally skilled visual storyteller staging a SWAT team raid on DeGroats compound with an editorial sleight-of-hand borrowed from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and always fostering a vivid sense of a place cut off from time and the world. When a character first mentions Jersey it sounds as far away as Jerusalem. Superior work by production designer Therese DePrez (""American Splendor"" ""Black Swan"") and costume designers Kurt amp; Bart (""Stoker"") adds to the lived-in milieu. Licensed for the first time for a movie soundtrack Pearl Jams ""Release"" (in both its original and a newly re-recorded version) bookends the film with Eddie Vedders wailing soulful refrain while composer Dickon Hinchliffe (""Winters Bone"") provides the moody original score.

Yes the working class is bearing the brunt of an inequitable economic system and yes the treatment of our returning soldiers from the last decade of war has been disgraceful but the film has nothing of substance say about any of this. Just raising the issues and portraying them as tragic and important isnt the same as making an actual statement. Clearly aiming for a 1970s edge -- and aping ""The Deer Hunter"" in particular -- ""Out of the Furnace"" is a pointless wallow in blue-collar tragedy that ultimately feels condescending to its subjects; each of the players get one or two attributes to play but ultimately theyre just place-holders in an exceedingly generic story. Also read August Osage County Review Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts Go at It Like Godzilla vs. Megalon In the films 2008 prologue Russell Baze (Christian Bale) works hard at a Pennsylvania steel mill making money in the hopes of starting a family with girlfriend Lena (Zoe Saldana). Much of that cash gets spent keeping his brother Rodney (Casey Affleck) out of trouble with local small-time crime boss Petty (Willem Dafoe). One night Russell has one drink too many at Pettys bar hits a car and goes to jail for killing two people while driving drunk. A few years later Russell gets out but things have gotten worse -- after being stop-lossed into four tours of Iraq Rodney cant un-see the horrors he has witnessed and Lena has moved on taking up with local cop Wesley (Forest Whitaker). Russell and Rodneys dad has died and while Russell has his job back the cheaper cost of Chinese steel spells doom for the plant. Rodney gets involved with Pettys underground fight matches even though hes lousy at taking a dive since his war-honed survival instincts kick in around the time hes supposed to let the other guy beat him down. Desperate for money Rodney gets Petty to put him in one last fight organized by Jersey hillbilly crime lord DeGroat (Woody Harrelson); given that the film opens with DeGroat assaulting first his date and then the beefy guy who tries to step in on her behalf at a drive-in we know this isnt going to end well. Also read Best Man Down Review One Wedding One Funeral Zero Appeal The cast is excellent and blameless; with the exception of Rodney screaming a litany of the horrors hes experienced at full volume they find moments of honesty in this rote material. Unfortunately in the screenplay by Brad Ingelsby and director Scott Cooper (""Crazy Heart"") those moments never add up to recognizable human beings who resonate. Bale (whose shoulder-length hair and goatee often make it look like hes playing Jesus again) carries a haunted look throughout as a man whos always trying to do the right thing but who suffers the blows of fate time and again. His handful of scenes with Saldana are among the films highlights. Harrelson Dafoe and Whitaker get saddled with one-note characters but they certainly know how to play that note. The film tries to dazzle us with parallel editing -- the evisceration of a freshly-killed deer alongside a moment of human brutality say or the creation of steel versus the cooking of heroin -- but that kind of thing only works when youve made the human being a richer character than youve made the deer. On its face ""Out of the Furnace"" is a timely story about the world we live in and its intentions certainly seem to be noble ones. But we all know to which furnace noble intentions can lead.
