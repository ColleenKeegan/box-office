"Cadillac Records Rhythm and plenty of blues | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsCadillac Records Rhythm and plenty of bluesCadillac Records is like one of those concerts you attend where numerous acts are on the bill each limited to short sets.Beyonce Knowles is the troubled Etta James in Cadillac Records.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Feb. 20 2009 Cadillac Records (out of 4)Starring Jeffrey Wright Adrien Brody Beyonce Knowles Mos Def Columbus Short Eamonn Walker and Cedric the Entertainer. Directed by Darnell Martin. 109 minutes. At the Bloor Cinema. 18A Cadillac Records is like one of those concerts you attend where numerous acts are on the bill each limited to short sets.Some you love some you like others you can barely stand. You may leave satisfied but its likely youll wish you could have had more of your faves.Chances are youll feel the same way about this film which vividly recounts the history of Chicagos influential Chess Records in all but name although the people portrayed - Muddy Waters Howlin Wolf Chuck Berry Etta James Little Walter Willie Dixon and label chief Leonard Chess - all go by their real names. Writer/director Darnell Martin a helmer for TVs Law amp; Order tells all of these stories over a timeline that spans from the early 1940s to the late 1960s. She also drops the needle on such momentous trends as the black R amp; B crossover to the white pop charts. Its a lot of ground to cover in a single movie.It begins in 1941 when black music was dismissively called ""race records"" but Chicago entrepreneur Chess (Adrien Brody) is only interested in making money ""It was just the colour of the bills that mattered."" Chess discovers and promotes the rough bluesman Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) whose personal travails become the closest thing to a focus that Cadillac Records possesses.Wright delivers a strong impression of Waters and his dogged determination to keep singing the blues while the world spins to rock n roll. His early hit ""I Cant Be Satisfied"" rings true on several levels including his home life with unhappy wife Geneva Wade (Gabrielle Union).But Muddys story at least as presented here is far less interesting than that of Chuck Berry (Mos Def) Etta James (Beyonce Knowles) Little Walter (Columbus Short) Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker) and Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer).All of these people are deserving of their own films and with these very actors playing them. The entire cast is great - and most also do the songs associated with their roles - but three are worthy of special note.As the star-crossed Berry whose signature guitar riffs influenced both The Beatles and The Stones even as his personal fortunes waned Mos Def seizes the mans vitality and vitriol.Beyonce doesnt show up as Etta James until well into the movie but she floods the frame with the distilled pain of an R amp; B singer known for her 1961 hit ""At Last"" whose intimate relations with both Chess and a heroin needle caused her no end of trouble.The mercurial Little Walter the only harmonica player inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame is reborn through Columbus Shorts impassioned rendering which gives us a glimpse into the sky rocket that was Walters short life.Considering how much ground Cadillac Records covers its downright weird that Martin completely ignores guitar great Bo Diddley and also Phil Chess Leonards brother and partner. Perhaps there were insurmountable legal restrictions. But the movie still serves as a dandy primer for rediscovering a lot of great music.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    23degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Its worth a documentary series but heres a sincere somewhat ungainly drama which summarises the cultural significance of white entrepreneur Leonard Chesss operation and samples the musicians triumphs and tribulations by laying everything end to end. In story terms its cavalcade of melodrama and conflict isnt always persuasive but writer-director Darnell Martins respect for the music shines through and the parts - some fine performances an alert eye for 50s social tensions - are often more striking than the whole.While its more interested in the legend than the facts the movie nails the bind facing black performers who needed the likes of Chess (Adrien Brody) to release records yet fell foul of sharp accounting in the process. Jeffrey Wrights imposing Muddy Waters is delighted like his stablemates to be rewarded with a Cadillac but his boss keeps schtum that his royalties paid for it. Since Chess had a genius for talent-spotting the movie cuts him a little slack though it dwells too much on his more than professional interest in the troubled voluptuous James (Beyonce Knowles nuanced and credible). Her searing vocalising takes pride of place on the lovingly recreated soundtrack which misses the raw electricity of the Chess recordings but like the film is good enough to drive you to the peerless originals.

By Peter Rainer December 6 2008 Save for later Saved Beyonce Knowles as ""Etta James"" in Cadillac Records Eric Liebowitz/Sony Pictures          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The Chicago-based Chess record label launched some of the great names in blues and rock n roll and they come to full-throated life in ""Cadillac Records."" Cofounded in 1956 by Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) it listed among its luminaries Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker) Little Walter (Columbus Short) Chuck Berry (Mos Def) and Etta James (Beyonce Knowles). Most of these actors do their own singing and theyre almost good enough to pass muster with the originals. Writer-director Darnell Martin has a free-swinging style that captures the heat of the recording sessions. She lets the music and not the camera do the showing off. The film suffers at times from biopic-itis - the narrative unfolds with the requisite heartbreak carefully apportioned - but its always eye-catching. Wrights full-scale performance is another feather in his well-plumed cap. Grade B+ (Rated R for pervasive language and some sexuality.) Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test?

The majesty flows not from Nixon himself though hes played phenomenally well by Frank Langella but from the spectacle of that tortured man summoning up yet again the tumultuous epoch he embodied. ENLARGE Frank Langella as Richard Nixon left and Michael Sheen as David Frost in a scene from the film ""Frost/Nixon."" Associated Press What a spectacle it is. Mr. Langella has most of the pieces of his performance in place from the start -- the seizing intelligence the ponderous physicality the cold cunning the alternate layers of stiffness and charm. Still its a performance and for a while a fairly circumspect one that declines to dwell on Nixons asperity his basso-profundo petulance and volcanic anger. But then toward the end of the extended interviews something remarkable happens as Michael Sheens Frost closes in and the camera with him on what he hopes will be the fallen presidents first mea culpa following the nightmarish sequence of events that came to be known as Watergate. Langella the actor starts to vanish and hes replaced by the spectral presence of a once-omnipotent chief of state contemplating in pitiless close-ups the nature of his deeds and the depth of his fall. Close-ups are indispensable here -- not only to the film which was directed by Ron Howard but to the original TV interviews which are available as of this week on DVD. ""The reductive power of the close-up"" is how its put by Sam Rockwell in the role of James Reston Jr. one of the writers and journalists Frost hired to shore up his production team. That power can cut every which way. TVs greatest sin is that it simplifies and diminishes Reston notes but he also says rightly that Frost succeeded in getting ""for a fleeting moment what no investigative journalist no state prosecutor no judiciary committee or political enemy had managed to get -- Richard Nixons face swollen and ravaged by loneliness self-loathing and defeat."" Join the DiscussionDiscuss What movies are you looking forward to this holiday season? And what have you seen already that you liked or disliked? What Ron Howard gets to a degree thats astonishing in a two-hour film is the density and complexity as well as the generous entertainment quotient of Peter Morgans screenplay. (Mr. Morgan previously wrote ""The Queen"" in which Michael Sheen played Tony Blair and ""The Last King of Scotland."") ""Frost/Nixon"" does more than dramatize the high points of the TV interviews. In the frantic run-up to the recorded interviews and during the early videotape sessions the film gives us the collateral drama of a talk-show host accustomed to celebrity chatter trying desperately to play the role of a serious journalist. ENLARGE Frank Langella ""Dont forget"" warns his producer whos played by Matthew Macfadyen ""youre in there with a major operator."" Thats an understatement; hes also in there with a master obfuscator. In the preliminary exchanges Nixon outmaneuvers his adversary at every turn. Frost may have been fed the right questions by his handlers but he cant assert himself long enough to pose them in the face of Nixons self-serving evasions and crafty ramblings to run out the clock. Yet ""Frost/Nixon"" operates on still another dramatic plane -- a battle of wits between two adversaries who turn out to be fully worthy of one another. Both men are desperate to succeed. Frost needs to revive a sagging career by selling an expensive problematic production that hes been forced to finance in large part out of his own pocket. Nixon needs to start the long process of rehabilitating himself and has been assured by his handlers that Frost an amiable lightweight will be a pushover. Untruer words have seldom been spoken unless to Sarah Palin. Michael Sheen a brilliant actor in his own right grows his character from a bright-eyed social butterfly to a gimlet-eyed interrogator who altogether plausibly finds his focus and the courage to go with it. From time to time the movie itself stands on shaky ground between show business and history -- Mr. Morgan has invented freely though not of course in the TV interviews. But its a movie in the fullest sense entertaining and instructive in equal measure with cinematography by Salvatore Totino and a supporting cast thats worthy of the co-stars. Rebecca Hall is David Frosts beautiful girlfriend Caroline Cushing Oliver Platt is the quick-witted ABC newsman Bob Zelnick and Kevin Bacon is Jack Brennan Nixons chief of staff. Walter Cronkite Eric Sevareid John Chancellor and other of their colleagues are seen as themselves in brief reminders of how valuable TV news used to be. Cadillac Records ""Cadillac Records"" may be a mess dramatically but its a wonderful mess and not just because of the great music. The people who made it must have harbored the notion almost subversive in a season of so many depressing films that going out to the movies should be fun. This particular movie which was written and directed by Darnell Martin could have been called ""Chess Records"" since thats the center of the story -- the rise and fall of the Chicago label that provided a home and surrogate family for blues legends-in-the-making. But the labels founder a young Polish emigre named Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) bought Cadillacs for his musicians when they made their first hits so the title has logic along with marketing allure. The allure of the cast cant be overstated even though Ms. Martins script seems determined to march the cast through every step along the decades-long way as the blues evolved into rock and roll. Jeffrey Wright is superb as Muddy Waters. Columbus Short is scarily mercurial as Little Walter. Ive never seen a performance quite so eerie -- effectively so -- as Eamonn Walkers Howlin Wolf whose speaking voice emanates from some mysterious cave of the winds. Mos Def whose acting grows more distinctive with each role plays the bumptious crossover prodigy Chuck Berry and Beyonce Knowles is the singular and self-destructive singer Etta James. Ms. Knowles sometimes shatters the sense of period with the sheer force of her musical personality but theres a lot to be said as ""Frost/Nixon"" demonstrates for displays of unrestrained power. Find TV listings at LocateTV. DVD TIP ENLARGE Sony BMG Ron Howard made an early splash as a director with the beguiling mermaid comedy ""Splash"" (1984) but hes no stranger to squeezing large amounts of information into movies notable for their clarity. Thats exactly what he did in ""Apollo 13"" (1995) the story of the near-fatal disaster that befell three American astronauts on their way to a lunar landing in 1970. Theyre played by Tom Hanks Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton. The exemplary script was written by William Broyles Jr. and Al Reinert.

The story traces the rise of Chess Records and the turbulent careers of such legendary Ramp;B artists of the 1950s and 60s as Muddy Waters Etta James Howlin Wolf and Chuck Berry. A rather disjointed plot follows these musical legends and their interactions with Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) a Polish-born bar owner.

Seeing a broader potential in the blues he records their songs and Chess Records is born. The title refers to Chess habit of giving his recording artists new Cadillacs as a reward for a hit record. Whether or not Chess exploited or properly compensated the musicians on his label is unclear but he seemed to have a familial affection for most of them. He also appears to have had an affection that transcended friendship with James (Beyonce Knowles). Conflict poisons some of the relationships among the musicians and between them and Chess but there are a few too many story lines which dilutes the individual sagas some of which come off like soap opera. Little Walter has a temper which leads to trouble with the law. His bond with Muddys long-suffering girlfriend (Gabrielle Union) could have been more fully explored. And Muddy clashes with Howlin Wolf (a fine Eamonn Walker). The film features too little about Berry (an engaging Mos Def) who crosses over to great fame. But when Berry is arrested Chess switches his focus to another artist James. Knowles captures James emotional vulnerability and is substantially better than she was in Dreamgirls. Of course she shines most when singing. While the story could use a tighter focus the ensemble is strong and the music makes Cadillac Records worth catching.

"Cadillac Records reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Cadillac Records reviewed. Cadillac Records reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 5 2008 1240 PM Cadillac Records Great music great acting and a new way to look at biopics. By Dana Stevens Watching the scrappy passionate Cadillac Records (Sony) only a week after the wondrous Milk I found myself musing What if we tried to be kinder to the biopic? Its a genre that takes so much flak for being literal-minded stodgy and predictable. Yet in recent years movies based on the real lives of public figures have also provided a place for superb work by actors (and sometimes directors as well). What if we regarded biopics in the same way we do jazz standards a familiar generic framework that each artist makes his or her own through improvisation? After all no one asks why Ella Fitzgerald is singing that corny old ""How High the Moon"" again. We listen to what she does with the song. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Cadillac Records is a good place to start with this rethinking of the biopic since its all about what one group of seminal black American musicians did with popular song. The film isnt so much about the biography of any one person as it as about the life of a record label Chess Records the Chicago blues label owned by Polish immigrant Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) that launched the careers of Muddy Waters Chuck Berry Etta James and other great ""crossover"" artists from the postwar years when blues begat rhythm and blues which begat rock n roll. Chess runs a nightclub on Chicagos South Side but after hearing the electrified Delta blues of Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) a transplanted Mississippi sharecropper he decides to devote himself to recording and distributing ""race records."" Chess is a complicated at times unethical boss He loves his musicians dearly but also fosters an unhealthy paternalism by distributing favors and Cadillacs in place of royalties and hes not above tossing around payola to get his recordings on the air. Muddy soon becomes a hot blues singer with a sky-high pompadour a pink guitar and all the women he wants--which it seems is quite a few. Cadillac Records isnt exactly big enough to be called sprawling but as the subplots multiply it does feel scattered. Muddys protege the needy and volatile harmonica player Little Walter (Columbus Short) is in love with Muddys loyal wife Geneva (Gabrielle Union). Muddy also has a musical nemesis Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker) a giant bass-voiced bluesman who loves to needle him about his financial dependence on Chess. And then out of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world in walks Etta James (Beyonce Knowles) a smack-addicted blues singer who claims to be the illegitimate child of pool player Minnesota Fats and who wastes no time in getting under Leonard Chess skin. Advertisement One of the strengths of Cadillac Records written and directed by Darnell Martin is that its a movie about music by someone who genuinely seems to enjoy listening to music. We see many performances in their entirety most notably those by the two real-life musicians in the cast Mos Def and Beyonce Knowles. Mos Def is devilishly charming as Chuck Berry. His loose-limbed physically antic performance captures the boyish dirty-minded energy of early rock n roll and his snide appraisal of ""Surfin USA"" (a note-for-note rip-off of his own ""Sweet Little Sixteen"" for which Berry sued the Beach Boys and won) is worth more than a hundred solemn disquisitions on the white appropriation of black music. As for Beyonce--oh my goodness. She hasnt yet understood what it is to be an ensemble actor; she always seems to be revolving by herself on a dais. But what a resplendent dais it is. Here as in Dreamgirls Beyonces conscious display of vocal virtuosity becomes a part of the character shes playing. Every one of Ettas songs is delivered with the subtext ""Watch me while I nail this song."" And as calculated as her display of vulnerability may be damned if we can stop watching. Jeffrey Wright is just the opposite an actor so generous to his fellow castmates that even when as here hes the best thing in the movie he still blends seamlessly into the story. These radically different acting styles--the quiet craftsman and the tempestuous diva--might seem to belong in two separate movies. But if you go back to the biopic-as-jazz-standard model I mentioned above you could think of them as two soloists--Billie Holiday and Coleman Hawkins say--each doing their own thing with the song.

Photo Eric Liebowitz Movie review Cadillac Records 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Cadillac Records Drama. Starring Adrien Brody Jeffrey Wright and Beyonce Knowles. Directed by Darnell Martin. (R. 109 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) ""Cadillac Records"" didnt have to be nearly as good as it is. The story of the record label that introduced the world to Muddy Waters Chuck Berry and others could have leaned entirely on its music and nobody would have minded. Instead somebody bothered to make a real movie and the result is a satisfying combination of great songs and strong dramatic performances. The company was Chess Records started in Chicago by a Polish immigrant named Leonard Chess who from the 1940s through the late 60s used his label to discover and promote black talent. The musicians Chess recorded have exerted a tremendous influence on popular music ever since. Take Muddy Waters who sounds a lot as if hes imitating the Rolling Stones - but 10 years before the Rolling Stones existed. The first hint that the movie means business comes in an early scene in which Waters working on a plantation in the Deep South encounters a man from the Library of Congress who is going around recording folk music. Waters accompanies himself on guitar and the man plays the song back for him. When Waters hears himself hes stunned. ""I feel like I met myself for the first time"" he says. This is a profound moment in his life and Jeffrey Wright as Waters invests it with the perfect mix of restraint realization and awe. Chess believes in the American dream in the way that only an immigrant can and to him the physical embodiment of that dream is the Cadillac. When Chess moves out of poverty into early success he buys himself one. Later he starts giving Cadillacs as presents. Waters gets the first. Soon harmonica player Little Walter (Columbus Short) and Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker) are on the scene followed a little later by Chuck Berry who drives the best Cadillac of all. Writer-director Darnell Martin takes care to make every one of these people vivid and complicated. Short plays Little Walter at a fever pitch throughout as a damaged and unbalanced hysteric who goes around carrying a gun. Howlin Wolf has perhaps 20 lines in the whole movie but theyre enough for Walker to suggest a cryptic menacing personality driven by a distinct code of ethics. And Mos Def as Chuck Berry captures the rock pioneers wisecracking surface and the shrewdness rage and bitterness underlying it. Yet its Beyonce Knowles as Etta James whos the movies revelation. Going in that seemed unlikely. Knowles looks about as much like Etta James as I do and when you add in the fact that she executive-produced the movie the casting sounds suspiciously like a vanity exercise as a bid for credibility or a chance to play dress-up. Well forget that. Shes great. First of all she has a terrific voice and this is a movie in which all the actors do their own vocals. She has a gifted singers capacity for reaching deep into her own emotions with ease so she hits every song out of the park. Whats more shes a real actress who brings out James in all her complex shadings - the scalding anger the pain the self-hatred the unwillingness to trust anybody and the helplessness to control her own turbulence. Knowles gives us a James who is almost a monster but Chess sees something inside her the vulnerability she tries to hide and when James realizes he sees it the two establish an unspoken connection thats really the loveliest thing in the movie. The reward is a miraculous little scene that Martin films in an extended extreme close-up just Knowles and Brodys faces as they talk. Just beautiful. A good general rule is that if one performance is good credit the actor. But if everyone in the movie is doing excellent work this is no coincidence. This is the product of superior direction. Martin made two low-budget films in the early 90s and has since worked in television. But feature films could use more directors who really know how to talk to actors and ""Cadillac Records"" suggests that Martin is one of them. -- Advisory Strong language drug use violence and simulated sex.

"Cadillac Records | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; cadillac-records ) Cadillac Records (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Cadillac Records while not a ""musical"" in the traditional sense is close to 50% musical content and 50% drama. Accordingly its about 50% good and 50% bad. The re-creations of some of the most noteworthy blues and early rock tunes from the 50s and 60s feature high-energy performances that do the originals proud. Sadly the drama that accompanies them is hackneyed and poorly paced - the kind of thing that makes the average made-for-TV movie appear well constructed. There are plenty of small pleasures to be found throughout Darnell Martins feature but a compelling storyline featuring three-dimensional characters is not among them. Cadillac Records is loosely based on actual events but it takes significant liberties with the established record. It begins in the early 1950s in Chicago with the establishment of the Chess Record company and ends some two decades later when the labels owner Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) sells. The film provides various highlights in compilation-album style of some of Chess most memorable performers over the period when Leonard owned the label Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) Little Walter (Columbus Short) Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker) Chuck Berry (Mos Def) and Etta James (BeyoncA(c) Knowles). Many of these individuals are given short dramatic arcs but none has enough screen time to develop much of personality or a bond with the audience. The music offers the soundtrack of its two decades with Jeffrey Wright covering Waters ""Im a Man"" and ""Im Your Hoochie Coochie Man""; BeyoncA(c) doing James ""Id Rather Go Blind"" ""Once in a Lifetime"" and the iconic ""At Last."" Mos Def contributes Berrys ""Maybelline"" ""Nadine"" and ""No Particular Place to Go."" Many of the songs are given full performances rather than brief 30-second clips. Stars like Wright and BeyoncA(c) prove themselves able to handle both the singing and acting needs of their roles although to be sure the latter aspects are not taxing. Adrien Brody comes off worse than either but thats probably because he isnt given an opportunity to sing. One apparent problem with Martins film is that theres too much material to be crammed into a 110-minute motion picture. The scope is overly ambitious the net too is too wide. It would have been challenging to pick one of Cadillac Records cast of big names and present a coherent  comprehensive motion picture with similar time constraints but by choosing to place a half-dozen figures under the umbrella and include all the music Martin has set herself up for failure. The movie is a mess but in large part because of the music it is something of an entertaining mess. There are a few moving scenes. One features Muddy Waters wife (Gabrielle Union) silently weeping while holding his child by another woman. She loves her husband and is willing to look the other way even for an infraction this deep. It causes one to wonder more about the mechanics of their marriage but the film moves on at breakneck speed. Likewise we are left to wonder about the depth of the affection between Leonard Chess and Etta James. Were provided with glimpses of it most notably when hes trying to keep her alert after a heroin overdose but like everything else it is given short shrift. Cedric the Entertainer playing Willie Dixon provides a retrospective voiceover that ties everything together. Every once in a while his omniscient voice provides some needed transitional information but this is a rare occasion when a little more narration might have helped. Cadillac Records exists mainly as a holiday throw-away for those with a deep and abiding love for the kind of music it showcases. Those looking for solid drama or complex song-and-dance choreography wont find it here. But for lovers of Muddy Waters Chuck Berry and Etta James theres enough to justify the price of a ticket. Or perhaps a better choice might be to spend roughly the same amount on a copy of the soundtrack.

Those of a certain age fondly remember its logo a silhouette of a king chess piece flanked by those of bishop and knight. Cadillac Records Darnell Martins boisterous if not always factual account of the house that Muddy Waters Howling Wolf Chuck Berry and Etta James built is a variety show of the personalities and music that spawned the urbanization of the blues and midwifed the birth of rock-and-roll. Martin who made her film debut in 1994 with the raucously funny I Like It Like That wrote and directed this ensemble drama with music and narrative enough for five features. In this crowded film that lacks a defining central character all the actors however dominant or subsidiary deliver star turns. This is not necessarily a good thing. Martins movie chronicles a transformational moment in popular music and culture. Before being eclipsed by the other performers Jeffrey Wright registers powerfully as bluesman Muddy Waters Mos Def duckwalks as country-to-rock crossover dream Chuck Berry and BeyoncA(c) wails her heart out as soul singer Etta James. But among these scene-stealing headliners (who include Adrien Brody as the labels ""ears"" Leonard Chess) the knockout is Eamonn Walker positively feral as blues sensation Howlin Wolf. (Martin previously worked with him on the hard-hitting behind-bars TV series Oz.) Musician-songwriter Willie Dixon (affable Cedric the Entertainer) provides the narration quilting together the story that spans 1941 to 1969 from Muddy Waters migrating to Chicago from Mississippi to Leonard Chess sale of the label to his artists. (In the interest of narrative pruning Martin entirely eliminated Philip Chess Leonards brother and partner from the story.) The real-life Chess was a contradictory and complicated figure not unlike Jamie Foxxs Curtis Taylor of Dreamgirls suggested by Motowns Berry Gordy. Dreamgirls was critical of Curtis shady deals and artistic backstabbing. But Cadillac Records (which takes its name from Chess habit of buying his artists fancy cars with their royalties instead of giving them the money outright) is mystifyingly neutral about Chess who bribed disc jockeys and cooked the books. Brody plays Chess as a slightly crooked but well-meaning musical cheerleader without fully emerging as a character. Cadillac Records is a toe-tapping experience where the music rather than the actors dominate. This undermines Wrights performance and advantages that of BeyoncA(c). The film boasts a soundtrack that includes the actors performing Muddy Waters ""Mannish Boy"" Howling Wolfs ""Smoke Stack Lightning"" Chuck Berrys ""Sweet Little Sixteen"" and Etta James ""At Last."" As the legendary James beset by drama and drug addiction BeyoncA(c) delivers - if more powerfully as actress than as a soul thrush. (I would have cast Queen Latifah whose voice has more edges and corners but then I would cast her in just about anything.) As drama Cadillac is adequate. As a jukebox musical it soars.

Cadillac Records (R) TriStar (109 min.) Directed by Darnell Martin. With Adrien Brody Jeffrey Wright Beyonce Knowles. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS No other popular music comes as directly painfully from the soul. Rockn roll has the adrenaline rush of parties and rebellion. Jazz is all intellect and quicksilver creativity. But the blues? The blues are messy. The blues are raw. The blues are pain. And messy raw and painful are the lives of the people who make them. The movie is called ""Cadillac Records"" due to the get-a-hit get-a-car glad-handing of the real labels owner. But its the story of Chess Records the storefront Chicago company whose roster could double as a hall of fame. Chuck Berry. Muddy Waters. Etta James. Sadly the movie isnt nearly as direct or accomplished as the artists it wants to immortalize. In fact everything about it feels rushed -- from the actors line readings often lost in mumbles to the script which awkwardly lurches about trying to get to everything in less than two hours. Beyonce Knowles is outstanding as Etta James who like many of her contemporaries could be the focus of a film bio. Its like a 45 played at 78. True the musical styles of the bluesmen are well captured -- often remarkably by actors who arent known for their musicality. The great stage actor Jeffrey Wright captures the proud simplicity of Muddy Waters. And Eamonn Walker is a marvelous Howling Wolf turning ""Smokestack Lightning"" into something best heard at midnight at a country crossroads. Particularly good is Beyonce Knowles as Etta James the baby-faced addict filled to bursting with fragile vulnerability and explosive talent. Shes so good in fact you want the whole movie to be about her her love for the label owner and her battles with heroin; its her chance a real ""Lady Sings the Rhythm and Blues"" part and you want more. Unfortunately the movie focuses on label owner Leonard Chess born Lejzor Czyz in Poland (and played here by Adrien Brody). Its not just that once again this is a black story told through a white mans eyes (although it is); its that it doesnt tell the story in an interesting way. What was it in the soul of this Jewish emigre that responded so powerfully to the laments of rural African-Americans? What was it really that he heard? You can guess based on ""Mo Better Blues"" what Spike Lee would have done with this material (particularly Chess casual and sometimes exploitive paternalism). But director Darnell Martin who also wrote the script seems overwhelmed working overtime to juggle four or five subplots (almost any one of the Chess artists would rate his or her own bio). Her movie doesnt take the risks it could or should. It could have the lush fullness of one of James jazzy crossover hits. It should have the back-and-forth call-and-response structure of the blues themselves (borrowed mostly from plantation work songs) in which an idea is put forth repeated and then completed. But instead it just chugs along like the trains that brought so many of these artists north. ""Cadillac Records"" could have been a showcase for Knowles (who helped produce it undoubtedly with that aim). It might have been a provocative exploration of the mid-century bonds between Jews and African-Americans -- or at the very least an examination of great black artists like Howling Wolf and Little Walter who are today ironically best known to geeky white-boy music fans. Instead its a movie thats mostly a soundtrack. But good lord still. What a soundtrack. Rating note The film contains strong language violence substance abuse and sexuality.

Booze drugs and various forms of corruption and racism pop up like clockwork in the loosely factual script by director Darnell Martin who returns to theatrical features after years of working mostly in TV following her much-praised debut ""I Like It Like That"" (1994). Play the Celebrity Crossover Pop Video Quiz Fortunately Martin has been more successful in rounding up a top-notch cast to play Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) and his top acts at the hugely influential Chess Records which he founded with brother Phil in Chicago in 1947. The wonderful Jeffrey Wright is most prominent as Chess first star and close friend Muddy Waters whose life as depicted here - Gabrielle Union plays his often cheated-on wife - was considerably more stable than those of his peers. Little Walter (Columbus Short) who often records with Waters is the most self-destructive of the bunch goading racist cops into beating him. Not much further behind is the drug-befuddled Etta James (Beyonce Knowles far better than in ""Dreamgirls"") who has been given an invented love affair with Chess (who has his own long-suffering wife played by Emmanuelle Chriqui). James - whose haunting ""At Last"" is a ubiquitous presence on movie soundtracks - is one of Chess big crossover artists. Even bigger is rock pioneer Chuck Berry - a smashing Mos Def - who gets hauled off to jail at the peak of his career for transporting under-aged girls across state lines. And finally the films most memorable performance is by Eamonn Walker who is scarily good as the singer known as Howlin Wolf. The film touches lightly on how the somewhat sleazy Chess (seen paying off deejay Alan Freed who pops up briefly in the person of Eric Bogosian) cheats his stars though in the movie at least he gifts each of them with a Cadillac. Performer and composer Willie Dixon briefly portrayed by Cedric the Entertainer (who also delivers the voice-over narration) successful sued Chess estate after taking over his company following Chess premature death. Most of the actors perform wonderful re-creations of the original song that give ""Cadillac Records"" entertainment value well beyond the hackneyed story lines. CADILLAC RECORDS Quite an earful.

Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday December 4 2008 1132 PM There are certain films - lets call them Road Map Movies - that drive you directly from point A to point B to point C with barely a stop for gas. ""Cadillac Records"" is such a film You see all the major landmarks but how enlightening can a road trip be if you never even get off the highway? Writer-director Darnell Martin clearly respects the fact that the history of Chess Records is a worthy subject. But therein lies a problem Overwhelmed by the enormity of the task before her shes forced to rush from scene to scene taking a snapshot of each and then hurriedly moving on. Coming off best is Jeffrey Wrights Muddy Waters who serves as the movies troubled conscience. In the late 1940s hes discovered by Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) whos hoping to start a record label built on the blues. By 1960 Chess has gathered a head-spinning array of talent Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker) Little Walter (Columbus Short) Chuck Berry (Mos Def) and Etta James (Beyonce Knowles). Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer) is here too narrating the story in flashback. Both the script and soundtrack touch on the basics which are undeniably vital. But surely Martin could have given us more than a Best Of tour Alan Lomax finds Waters at a Mississippi shack. James records ""At Last."" Berry gets ripped off by the Beach Boys. And ironically the director is so determined to pack in as much as possible she ends up playing fast and loose with facts while speeding by complex issues of identity and exploitation. She is blessed however with a talented cast that shares her belief in the importance of the project. Wright and Mos Def give their best performances in recent memory Beyonce finds just the right note of bruised vulnerability and the intensely charismatic Walker does tremendous work with an underwritten role. But ultimately these arent people were learning about theyre burnished icons. Given the way these towering artists were overlooked for so long maybe thats some kind of progress. Even better however would be to give them the truly soulful movie they deserve. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Beyonce Knowles portrays Etta James Cadillac Records. Photo Eric Liebowitz Cadillac Records 1 / 1 Back to Gallery doesnt so much strut onscreen in Cadillac Records as she does swagger -- a heavy womanly walk that seems propelled by her ample (perhaps padded) hips. As Etta James Knowles exudes a pure forceful sexuality whether shes outstretched on a hotel bed singing behind a studio microphone or letting fly a barrage of curse-filled rants. Its a bold often-blazing performance and a sharp turn from her subtle work in Dreamgirls. Knowles plays James as a wounded wild bird with little trust for people and even less patience for them. She even gets a meaty scene that mines a dark moment in James drug use. And Knowles nails several of James signature tunes. She turns All I Could Do Was Cry and Id Rather Go Blind into tragic tear-stained emotional statements. The trouble with Cadillac Records though is that Knowles -- and several other standout elements -- simply arent given enough screen time. The Houston diva doesnt even appear until almost an hour into the film. Up until then its the mildly entertaining story of Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) the scrappy nightclub owner who nurtured a stable of black artists under the Chess Records banner and made them pop-crossover stars in the 1950s. (The films title refers to Chess penchant for buying his acts Cadillacs once they hit the charts.) His first discovery Muddy Waters is played by Jeffrey Wright who grounds the story with a solemn grace. But Wright is so intent on nailing Waters speaking voice that its sometimes difficult to understand him. It also gives the character an oddly muted quality. Writer and director Darnell Martin (a TV veteran who also helmed 1994s I Like It Like That) has a clear love for the material and the music. Perhaps too much. She crams so much into Cadillac Records that its hard to get a firm grasp on the weight of her story -- the racial barriers that were being broken. The scope of the film makes it impossible to connect emotionally with some of the legendary characters. Martin randomly lingers on some moments and glosses over others. Chuck Berry (an adequate if not arresting Mos Def) is relegated to scenes that play up his penchant for women. Hes quickly shipped to jail and forgotten. Eamonn Walker makes for a menacing Howlin Wolf (and boasts a bellowing voice) but we never really understand the reasons behind his brooding behavior. And Gabrielle Union a smart appealing actress has little to do as Waters put-upon wife (aside from looking distressed). Columbus Short manages considerable impact as Little Walter the legendary harmonica player whose talent is silenced by his tragic personal life. Shorts gestures and facial expressions radiate pain and trouble in almost every scene. He seems to understand innately the delicate balance of music and madness. Brody has some good moments as Chess and he captures a nice mix of ambition assuredness and insecurity. His scenes with Knowles and Wright are particularly good. Martin could have made a much more compelling film by focusing on just a few characters instead of trying to deconstruct an entire record label. Maybe Cadillac Records could serve as a springboard for Knowles or Short to truly shine in biopics of their respective legends. joey.guerrachron.com Todays Deals Refurb Astak Wireless Surveillance Camera Kit for 50 + free...

By  Ricardo Baca | rbacadenverpost.com PUBLISHED December 3 2008 at 1217 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 225 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Former Japanese consulate residence hits the Denver market for 4.2 million Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Blake Shelton plays free intimate show at Denvers Grizzly Rose Tennis-ball-sized hail knocks out 27 Colorado Springs police cars Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Most music biographies come down to a played-out (yet still true) cliche the dangers of sex drugs and rock n roll. The cinematic moments are familiar -- the lead character mainlining heroin or naked with a lover in the back seat of a car. Later the protagonists prove their desirability on stage holding a guitar or tickling a piano or making love to a microphone. Its an intoxicating combination. And given the lives of subjects Muddy Waters Little Walter Willie Dixon Etta James Chuck Berry Howlin Wolf and Leonard Chess ""Cadillac Records"" should be a slam dunk of a biopic -- a film rife with drama and sadness beauty and integrity. ""Cadillac Records"" in theaters today certainly plays off the strengths of its story -- the unwavering loyalty of label man Chess to his first signed artist Waters and Little Walters heartbreaking fall to alcoholism. But the film tries too hard and its storytelling is sometimes clunky and awkward -- and that just doesnt fly with these cats who are anything but so smooth. The film starts where it needs to the Mississippi sharecropper fields. McKinley Morganfield nicknamed Muddy works the fields by day and plays his guitar by night. Folklorist Alan Lomax doing work for the Library of Congress finds Muddy sitting on his front porch and records him playing and singing. ""I feel like Im meeting myself for the first time"" Waters says after hearing himself on playback. Waters later moves to Chicago where he eventually starts playing with Little Walter. Once the connection is made with Leonard Chess -- who is transitioning from the nightclub business to his very own record label called Chess -- the crux of the story is found. Chess Records found its footing with Muddy Waters -- and then with Little Walter. A number of other performers followed including Howlin Wolf Chuck Berry and Etta James. Make a hit record and Chess will buy you a Caddy. This of course represents a monumental arc in American music. Muddy is the father of Chicago blues. Berry is the father of rock n roll. Chess Records was one of the most important labels of the 60s immortalized by the Rolling Stones song ""2120 South Michigan Avenue."" The Stones were named after one of Muddys songs and they titled that song after the Chess studio address -- a place they visited and recorded in on their first American tour in 1964. Darnell Martin who wrote and directed ""Cadillac Records"" handles the films biggest moments with class. Chess bribing a white disc jockey to play Waters first record. Waters introducing a vulnerable Little Walter to booze right after the harp player learned of his mothers passing. Chuck Berry single-handedly beating segregation laws -- and later being jailed for his relations with an underage white girl. And of course the white man getting rich on the black mans music. Its the films small moments that are blown out making for a tiresome experience Waters getting dressed in a pallid bathroom before a big gig. The Rolling Stones meeting Waters their idol. The uncomfortably close relationship between Leonard Chess and Etta James -- the fuel behind the worst in-studio scene of the movie. And the closing scene highlighting Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction dates over individual contributions is a ham-handed mess. Jeffrey Wright is outstanding as Muddy Waters. He plays the bluesman as an early-day Tupac Shakur -- with a thuggish stroll bandannas tied in the front and a surprising gentle side. Adrien Brodys Leonard Chess is doggishly loyal and expectedly flawed and Brody pulls it off. Eamonn Walker as Howlin Wolf steals each scene he appears in. Cedric the Entertainer is underused as bassman/songwriter Willie Dixon and Mos Def contributes Chuck Berrys mischievous smile and singular duck walk with charm. And Columbus Short shows impressive depth as the winning but troubled Little Walter. From the films marketing youd think Beyonce Knowles is driving this Cadillac. But shes not. She makes her first appearance in the second half of the film and she plays a supporting role at best. And Knowles best known for her Ramp;B albums isnt able to hang with this stellar cast. Etta James was a complex woman in the 60s and 70s -- incredibly talented and haunted at the same time. There are many demons behind those famous recordings and Knowles doesnt quite get it. Rather than lifting her up the excellent cast around her shows her up. Ettas story will be better told in another film surely.

Comments Cadillac Records Like the much-superior Who Do You Love this musical dramatizes the rise of Chicagos legendary Chess Records playing faster and looser with history than the other movie but also offering more marquee wattage. Founded by Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) and his brother Phil (oddly omitted here) Chess transformed southern ""race"" music into urban blues and catapulted such artists as Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) and Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer) to fame if not fortune. Later the company helped usher in rock n roll with crossover stars like Chuck Berry (Mos Def). The electrifying music helps camouflage the screenplays hyperbole. Darnell Martin directed; with Eamonn Walker Eric Bogosian and a smoldering Beyonce Knowles as Etta James who the movie implies had an affair with the married Leonard Chess. R 109 min.

Starring Beyonce Knowles Adrien Brody Jeffrey Wright Eamonn Walker Mos Def Cedric the Entertainer Columbus Short Gabrielle Union Director Darnell Martin Running time 148  Editorial Review The swirl of history energizes ""Cadillac Records"" the chronicle of the rise and fall of Chicagos legendary Chess Records the 1950s music powerhouse that brought to prominence such stars as Muddy Waters Etta James and Chuck Berry. Its a rousing fast-paced tale told with a modicum of verve and packed with colorfully flawed occasionally heroic and even tragic characters.It also feels disappointingly bloated and too fast-paced by half.Cramming in that history doesnt leave much room for -- oh I dont know -- story.Theres a teeny little hole in the middle of ""Cadillac Records."" Its right where youll find Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) the man around whom the film revolves.A Jewish immigrant from Poland with a gifted ear for the blues Chess was the co-founder of Chess Records. By championing the work of guitarist Waters (Jeffrey Wright) singer James (Beyonc Knowles) harmonica player Little Walter (Columbus Short) growling vocalist Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker) the duckwalking Berry (Mos Def) and others he created previously unheard-of opportunities for African American artists.The movie also makes clear that he was no saint shuffling royalty payments from one musician to another at times and enriching himself while some of his artists went hungry.But were never given much insight into who Chess really is what makes him tick or why we should care about him.To the extent that we see a real person its largely through his relationship with James which the film depicts as part unrequited romance and part power struggle between a strong-willed if emotionally damaged woman and her sugar daddy. Its the most fully fleshed connection between any two characters in the film yet its given short shrift.History is propelled forward by the filmmakers over-reliance on such now-stale staples of musical biopics as the montage of nightclub marquees ka-ching-ing cash registers close-ups zooming in on the names of chart-topping singles and newspaper headlines.Its a breathless approach leaving little time in this speeding noisy overcrowded ""Cadillac"" to take in anything other than the milestones that go whizzing past.-- Michael OSullivan (Dec. 5 2008)Contains profanity racial epithets sex scenes partial nudity violence and alcohol and drug abuse.

"Movie review Cadillac Records -- 3 out of 5 stars - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review Cadillac Records -- 3 out of 5 stars In 1950s Chicago Cadillac Records follows the exciting but turbulent lives of some of Americas musical legends through the rise of Chess Records -- stars that include Muddy Waters Leonard Chess Little Walter and Howlin Wolf Etta James and Chuck Berry. Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Brilliantly cast and ambitious to beat the band Cadillac Records is a little movie that aims big. It tries to capture nothing less than the moment when white culture embraced black music and rock n roll was born.But even if the iPod Nation craves this history the movie over-reaches in trying to capture all that Chess Records witnessed. Its the label that summoned delta blues to Chicago and electrified it where Muddy Waters growled and Howlin Wolf howled where Chuck Berry invented rock guitar and where Etta James sang the greatest make-out music ever recorded.This film by veteran TV director Darnell Martin (Their Eyes Were Watching God) hits many of the highs and lows of this storied history. She brings in integration radio payola scandals and the Chess influence on those who came later ( The Rolling Stones). Its edgy enough to have blues men and women talk the way blues men talk and indulge in their indulgences. But its a dry and somewhat whitewashed look at a place where musicians made money and history mostly the latter.Oscar winner Adrien Brody O plays Leonard Chess the striving immigrant who traded in his junk business for a juke joint and then burned that down to finance the birth of Chess Records. This Chess is a father-figure crook treating musicians like ""family"" paying them off in fancy automobiles and never letting them look at his books.""Welcome to Cadillac Records"" his first artist Muddy Waters (the superb Jeffrey Wright) tells Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker). ""You stay around long enough everybody gets one"" meaning a Caddy.Chess songwriter Willie Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer) traces Waters career from his discovery as a blues-playing share-cropper to his decades of Chess servitude the good woman (Gabrielle Union well cast) he cheated on the harmonica playing rival Little Walter (Columbus Short) who lived hard and suffered for it. Mos Def is a dead-on Chuck Berry mastering the masters musical playfulness and personal bitterness and mistrust. Beyonce Knowles is beyonc-ilicious as Etta James a deeply troubled singer who was the very essence of ""soul."" Writer-director Martin has made a competent but misshapen movie. Her cluttered script robs the film of the heart of a Ray or Walk the Line. Its so much that its no wonder that she mucks up the chronology. Martin even edited out Phil Chess the other half of the ""Chess brothers"" who founded the label.Knowles and Brody heat it up but while most of the characters age Brodys doesnt. Or get a haircut.Any student of early rock history would have to be concerned that Hollywood might have only one chance to get this right. Cadillac Records doesnt manage that but with this cast doing its own singing and history this rich its close enough for rock n roll.

Perhaps because Down herself grew up with two autistic siblings she brings a decidedly piss-(and-shit)-and-vinegar approach to the story of shy Queensland teen Thomas (Rhys Wakefield) who has enough trouble fitting in at his new high school and returning the flirtation of his comely phys-ed classmate (stunning saucer-eyed newcomer Gemma Ward) without the interference of his shortbus-riding autistic brother (Luke Ford who acts the part with total conviction). Sweetie this isnt but within its resolutely mainstream parameters The Black Balloon courses with a firsthand feel for languorous Aussie summers the shifting scales of love and hate in sibling relationships and the earned wit that helps families cope with difficult situations. The time is the 1980s and as in the Australian New Wave films that proliferated during that period one has the sense of a cadre of bright young filmmaking talents on the verge of breaking out. (Majestic Crest; Town Center 5) (Scott Foundas)CADILLAC RECORDS Although the fact-based Cadillac Records stars heavyweights Jeffrey Wright (fantastic as usual as Muddy Waters) Eammon Walker (a gruffly commanding Howlin Wolf) Mos Def (whose Chuck Berry nearly walks away with the film) and Adrien Brody (all moist-eyed empathy as Chess Records founder Leonard Chess) the hovering question is how well Beyonce does as Etta James. The answer Shes adequate. In this film about the rise and fall of the legendary Chess music label and its stars Beyonce cusses up a storm wields her lushly voluptuous body like a WMD and navigates an emotional OD scene without embarrassing herself. But when she performs the James classics ""At Last"" and a well-placed ""Id Rather Go Blind"" her limitations -- and the films -- snap into focus. Beyonces pop-soul voice lacks the earthy evocative carnality and gritty pathos of James and when she tosses her signature yodel-riffing into one classic tune your ears die a little. Similarly director Darnell Martin (I Like it Like That) races through the scripts bullet points -- Ramp;B is built on the dreams of white immigrant sons and black sharecropper descendants; white appropriation of Negro creativity is played out in boardrooms and in the thievery of style and ideas; soul music and the blues are sounds of self-affirmation -- with a brisk superficiality that leaves crucial plot points underdeveloped and unresolved and refuses to engage the dark side of Leonard Chess paternalism. (Citywide) (Ernest Hardy)GO  FROST/NIXON Has any president since Lincoln inspired more movies TV mini-series and operas? Dutifully directed by Ron Howard from screenwriter Peter Morgans enjoyably glib play Frost/Nixon is the latest installment of the Nixoniad appropriately set in a media hall of mirrors. The subject is not Watergate but its aftermath -- the series of four televised interviews with the disgraced 37th president which British chat star David Frost orchestrated and syndicated in the spring of 1977 a little less than three years after Nixons resignation. A docudramatist whose screen credits include The Queen and The Last King of Scotland Morgan conceives the Frost-Nixon interviews as a prizefight between two comeback-hungry veterans ever-cheerful Frost (Michael Sheen wide-eyed and so coiffed as to be a distraction) and sonorous gloomy Nixon (Frank Langella). In opening up the play however the movie unavoidably dissipates its power. Having Nixons actual lair the so-called Casa Pacifica as a location is considerably less compelling than the stripped-down onstage set. Still Frost/Nixons main attraction is neither its topicality nor its historical value but Langellas re-creation of his Tony Award-winning performance. Langella doesnt shake his jowls or attempt Nixons sickly smile. Ice cold and physically imposing the actor is a naturally menacing presence; his stooped shambling eye-rolling Nixon is like a prehistoric beast at bay. In his 1970 speech on Cambodia Nixon had warned that America would become ""a pitiful helpless giant."" Langellas performance is the lament of a man who became what he beheld. (ArcLight Hollywood) (J. Hoberman)GARDENS OF THE NIGHT The title is the first sign that the audience is in for it. The second is a childs voice reading from The Jungle Book and the third is the voice of a counselor (John Malkovich) comforting the pretty young thing sitting before him. From there we are treated to a dubiously long ""Stranger Danger"" sketch that pushes way beyond the limits of taste and reason All dripping faucets dulcet piano tinkling blinking lightbulbs fairy-tale allusions and Tom Arnold whispering sweet nothings Gardens of the Night poeticizes the horror of young Leslie (Ryan Simpkins) being kidnapped and passed around like a rag doll along with her surrogate brother Donnie (Jermaine Smith) in a not-so-surreptitious child pornography ring that includes creeps played by B-listers Harold Perrineau and Jeremy Sisto. Pitched at the risible level of Marco Kreuzpaintners Trade the film never quite recovers from writer-director Damian Harris dithering way of shooting things. Back in the present the subject is the way the abused become abusers and how the bond between the older Leslie (Gillian Jacobs) and Donnie (Evan Ross) is tested on the streets -- but after being built on such a shoddy foundation their current-day reality registers only as an afterthought.

Sep. 13 600pm GO  A GOOD DAY TO BE BLACK AND SEXY Writer-director Dennis Dortchs A Good Day to Be Black and Sexy is a series of vignettes that largely hinges on sex scenes of varying degrees of erotic heat. Its less the sexual sizzle and more the psychological nuances of relationships that interest him. In ""Reciprocity"" a womans refusal to return her boyfriends oral favors throws light on larger power struggles while in ""Tonight"" a teenagers refusal to give her virginity to her boyfriend lands her stranded roadside and later flirting with an older man. ""Her Man"" follows as a steamy coupling between a mistress and her married lover results in a tug-of-war about the terms of their relationship. And ""American Boyfriend"" dips into pools of race and culture clash as a young Chinese woman attempts to hide her black boyfriend from her family. Dortch has a sly often deceptively light hand as he references everything from 70s Blaxploitation to underground/indie hip-hop and Ramp;B Asian porn and Cassavettes in his portrait of the battleground dynamics of Negroes in lust and love. A couple of the tales drag on too long; all could be written tighter and a few could be pushed further conceptually but Dortchs manipulation of stereotype and the associations embedded in everything from skin tone to music set him apart as a talent to watch. (The Bridge) (Ernest Hardy)GO  HUNGER A man eats a breakfast loaded with bad cholesterol then walks out of his house looks up and down the street and under his car and starts his engine. Steve McQueens relentlessly arty film about life in Northern Irelands notorious Maze prison during the 1981 hunger strike spearheaded by IRA leader Bobby Sands begins with a comic nod to the cinema of violence then proceeds to a long wallow in it which is none the less lyrical for being wrapped in wordless outrage. Hungers subject is the indomitability of the spirit in the face of the degradation of the body inflicted from without by the bare knuckles and truncheons of prison officers who range from vicious to ambivalent and from within by the inmates collective refusal to eat or wear prison clothes. How you respond to it will depend in part on the strength of your stomach but mostly on whether you buy the idea of martyrdom as a political moral or aesthetic ideal. Every grim detail of the unequal battle between prisoners and their guards is enlarged in ritual near-silence lit in cold blues and greens and presided over by the desiccated drone of Margaret Thatchers voice deriding the protest. Late in the movie Hunger pauses for a lengthy ping-pong exchange between Sands (a very good Michael Fassbender) and Father Dominic Moran (Liam Cunningham) the worldly Catholic priest who urges Sands to negotiate rather than embark on a hunger strike that will result only in unnecessary deaths. However wittily written by playwright Enda Walsh their exchange much admired in early reviews of Hunger is little more than McQueens de rigueur sop to a more pragmatic less heroic vision that proves weightless next to the rapturous Christ-like images of a progressively more emaciated Sands. Those of us who see the martyr as one of the more pernicious of human fantasies -- in these times how could you not? -- are more likely to go with the priest who tells Sands ""You got no appreciation of a life."" There is no defending Thatcher but what is it about the IRA -- a movement founded in necessity and destroyed by its own murderously intransigent absolutism -- that causes the brains of otherwise intelligent artists to fall out? The farther I got from the queasy beauty of McQueens movie the more I hated it. (Nuart) (Ella Taylor)NOBEL SON Directionless Ph.D. candidate Barkley (Bryan Greenberg) lives in the shadow of his overbearing genius father Eli (Alan Rickman) who is about to be awarded the Nobel Prize. Thats when two seemingly unrelated events occur Barkley beds a gorgeous artist named City Hall (Eliza Dushku) and is kidnapped by Thaddeus (Shawn Hatosy) an unhinged young man who wants to hold Barkley for ransom. Barkley convinces Thaddeus to include him in the plan excited at the prospect of fleecing his old man. Anyone who suffered through the Tarantino knockoffs of the 1990s knows that no filmic crime caper will run smoothly but director and co-writer Randall Miller is so ill at ease with the basic building blocks of the genre that Nobel Son quickly announces itself as one of those misbegotten clunkers where just about every creative decision isnt just wrong but tone-deaf. Nobel Sons desperately ""edgy"" vibe extends to all aspects of the film but is most noticeable in the cavalcade of flip one-liners delivered by a cast that has been told to give their characters maximum quirkiness. The more experienced actors mostly keep their dignity but the younger cast members -- particularly Dushku as a blank femme fatale and Greenberg as the charmless antihero -- posture insufferably. For Miller this dark thriller represents an attempt to shift gears after back-to-back feel-good films Bottle Shock and Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing amp; Charm School. Hes succeeded in a way Nobel Son just feels awful. (Citywide) (Tim Grierson) ONE DAY YOULL UNDERSTAND Jeanne Moreaus remarkable face has been carrying movies both great and not for the past 60 years. Amos Gitais latest falls into the second category though the blame can hardly be placed on its octogenarian star. Moreau plays Rivka a World War II survivor waiting out her final years in a Parisian apartment. Rivka is not inclined to think about the past but her son Victor (Hippolyte Girardot) starts to prod her after discovering that his father made a declaration of Aryan heritage -- a revelation with the sort of troubling implications that are ideally unraveled in flashbacks over the course of a stolid fest-circuit-baiting international co-production. One Day Youll Understand represents Gitais most restrained work in sometime (theres little of the rafter-reaching hysteria that marked Free Zone) but if anything the film may be too controlled The decision to frame much of the action in long prowling tracking shots creates a feeling of remove that doesnt quite fit with the materials emotionally explosive quality. It doesnt help that Girardot gives a grating lead performance and that a terrific performer like Emmanuelle Devos (as his let-sleeping-dogs-lie sister) is given so little to do. Moreau meanwhile is smart enough to let her magnificent countenance do the heavy lifting -- the moments where Gitai simply focuses on her face do more to suggest the weight of a full complicated life lived than all of the scripts carefully manicured machinations. (Music Hall; Town Center 5) (Adam Nayman)PUNISHER WAR ZONE It really shouldnt have been so hard to make a decent Punisher movie; after all the character is basically just Death Wishs Paul Kersey on steroids in spandex. How come it took Hollywood so long to figure that out? Following a direct-to-video 80s version starring Dolph Lundgren and an unfortunately campy 2004 reboot with Thomas Jane Lionsgate has gotten back to basics with Punisher War Zone. Romes Ray Stevenson plays the skull-clad Frank Castle like a cross between Steven Seagal and Jason Voorhees. Early on he fixes his own broken nose by jamming a pencil up his nostril; nobody else in the movie gets off quite so easily as blood brains intestines and chunks of flayed skin fly. (Its not technically a horror movie but nobody told the effects guys that.) The plot such as it is involves Castle second-guessing his life as a vigilante after accidentally killing an undercover fed while fighting off a mobster (Dominic West) who has fallen into a giant glass-crusher and been recycled as a lethal Leatherface lookalike called Jigsaw. But the script isnt what matters here This is a slasher movie with guns and uh huh-huh thats pretty cool. (Citywide) (Luke Y. Thompson)REACH FOR ME LeVar Burtons odd yet progressive-minded career indeed has its roots in Kunta Kinte the 1977 Emmy-nominated role that launched him into the ubiquitous-TV-personality stratosphere (Celebrity Challenge of the Sexes 2 The Muppets Go Hollywood et al.). In the 80s Burton began a 25-year stint teaching literacy to kids on PBSs Reading Rainbow and brought amiable nerdiness and eleventh-hour crisis sensibility to Star Trek The Next Generation without ever playing the Magical Negro. He also directed episodes of that show and three subsequent Trek spin-offs and its behind the camera that youll more often experience the former seminary students wholesome values today. Alas Reach for Me Burtons characteristically earnest new melodramedy about terminally ill hospice patients learning to embrace their final days and each other is weepy TV-grade goo (and without a bucket list in sight). Seymour Cassel stars as a bedridden cantankerous old coot who cant stomach his new roomie (Johnny Whitworth) a rapidly deteriorating pretty-boy too young and sensitive to die. Alfre Woodard is the no-bullshit caretaker Burton the toe-painting queer nurse and Adrienne Barbeau the silver-haired (and tongued) love interest who allows Cassel a sexy peek at her mastectomy. Yes its as tender as it is disturbing such as when Cassel has to clear Whitworths colostomy tube to save his life. Seniors may find relatable depth in such geriatric gestalt but for my money Id rather be torn apart by Synecdoches bleak existential crises. (Sunset 5) (Aaron Hillis) TENNESSEE Fourteen years after they fled their abusive father brothers Carter (Adam Rothenberg) and Ellis (Ethan Peck) decide to drive from New Mexico to Tennessee to contact him in the hopes that hes a bone-marrow match for the leukemia-stricken Ellis. If youre wondering why the guys dont save time by calling first youre not on the wavelength of director Aaron Woodleys contemplative pokey road movie/sibling drama which exists in an antiquated slow-motion world of pay phones smoky roadhouses and kindhearted waitresses who dream of becoming country singers. Screenwriter Russell Schaumburg has a knack for subtly unrolling his scripts themes of forgiveness and second chances but while the road trip contains several nice moments -- and an unexpectedly empathetic performance from pop superstar Mariah Carey as said waitress -- Tennessee just doesnt add up to much. Despite the inclusion of an ill-advised chase-thriller element midway through and a shockeroo surprise at the end Woodleys film mostly floats along on its melancholy drift so well-attuned to the low-key rhythms of its beaten-down characters that it never quite summons up enough energy for the rest of us who are along for the ride.

Its not rock and roll but its close. Cadillac Records has plenty of the above ingredients along with violence booze expensive cars and a sound that would influence the Rolling Stones and other artists to pick up guitars plug in and play. The story of Chess Records is the story of Muddy Waters Chuck Berry Howlin Wolf and Willie Dixon. Its also the story of Leonard Chess the White businessman who founded the label and his life is at the center of the film. Adrien Brody plays Chess as an ambitious former junkyard dealer who opened a club then used the insurance money after it burned down to start his own record label. Soon he signs Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) along with protege Little Walter (Columbus Short). The hits start flowing as does the money - though Waters seems capable of spending almost every dime he makes - and soon everyones driving a Cadillac. Life is good and it gets better when Chess signs an artist with a different sound Chuck Berry (Mos Def) who turns the blues into rock and roll. But although Berry is thrifty with his money hes less careful with his personal life; hes arrested and goes to prison for violation of the Mann Act (transporting a woman across state lines for immoral purposes) so Chess needs another hitmaker. He turns to Etta James (Beyonc Knowles). But does he turn to her for more? The stories told here are amazingly entertaining - Howlin Wolf (a ferocious Eamonn Walker in the films best performance) threatening to kill Waters if he steals a band member; Waters standing outside Chess Records when the Rolling Stones pull up thrilled at meeting their idol (they took their name from one of his songs); Chess paying Alan Freed (Eric Bogosian) to play his artists records on the radio. Yet the film is told in a curious fashion. Dixon (Cedric the Entertainer) introduces it by way of recording his memoirs but we dont see much of him during the movie and we dont find out till the end that he wrote a lot of the hits. And the story takes a different course once James comes on board. Chess tries to ease her tormented soul without much success. Abandoned by her father (his supposed identity is a surprise if you dont know the story) she struggles with addiction. But when she sings. . . . Not coincidentally with Beyonc the biggest name in the cast and serving as a producer she gets the most time behind the microphone belting out among others a powerhouse version of At Last. Her voice is great but her relationship with Chess isnt as interesting as the origins of the label with such a stable of rich characters. Brody is good as Chess who looks like a nice businessman but is willing to play rough. Wright captures the complex Waters (and does a credible job playing the guitar) and Short is suitably scary as the mercurial troubled Little Walter. Beyonc does fine trying to get at James turmoil although singing is obviously her stronger suit. The music is of course great. But the real strength of Cadillac Records is found in the stories behind it. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Heading up to Chicago he electrifies that guitar and hooks up with Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) a nice Jewish boy whos been looking to do something not so nice. Chess opens a nightclub where the performances sometimes end in gunfire and when the club burns down he starts to record the new sounds hes been featuring there. His label Chess Records is a Midwestern precursor to Sun Records located behind a storefront (with rotating vinyl logo) on Chicagos South Side. When the records sell he gives each of his musicians a new Cadillac neglecting to mention that it came out of their royalties. Its tempting to say Cadillac Records is about the moment that the blues turned into rock amp; roll. Only that wouldnt be true. The films boisterous fun kicks off from its recognition that the blues already was rock amp; roll; no ""transformation"" was necessary. The writer-director Darnell Martin who made the tough and nimble I Like It Like That (1994) is out to capture those days in all their proud violent glory. She blasts rhythm amp; blues out of its museum-piece quaintness. Cadillac Records lacks a center -- Leonard is more like a hub (he isnt sketched in) -- yet its an enjoyable ramble with a feel for what made the early days of rock as wild as any that followed. Wright plays Waters as an elegant tomcat in boxy suits who doesnt pretend he can love one woman at a time. His street counterpart is Howlin Wolf (Eamonn Walker) a scary customer who stares at Chess from behind the recording-studio glass with a look of barely contained homicide. Then theres Chuck Berry -- played by Mos Def who nails the legends apple-cheeked charisma as well as his saucy grooves. Just as Berry cracks the pop charts hes sidetracked by the law. (Coincidence? You decide.) His slot gets filled by Etta James a torch rocker and junkie played by Beyonce Knowles who just about burns a hole in the screen with her sultry torment. As a woman who rocked the house but could get no satisfaction Beyonce does a Lady Sings the Blues in miniature. Now will someone give this lady a great lead role?

For all its copious flaws Walk Hard The Dewey Cox Story perfectly nailed the trajectory of every single rockudrama that has tarnished a legends legend--the big bang turned sad whimper. In this version--told in flashback no less with overwrought narration provided by Cedric the Entertainer as Chess producer session musician and house songwriter Willie Dixon--there is no Phil Chess only Leonard played by an actor Adrien Brody who with his anachronistically tousled hair and Forever Fonzie wardrobe looks as much like Leonard Chess as he does well Howlin Wolf. Fabrications in the name of movie myth-making are of course to be expected from a genre that demands condensing a life into a handful of Defining Episodes; all biopics reduce and trivialize. But so egregious are the deficiencies and distortions here--in this universe the Rolling Stones came to the U.S. and the Beach Boys ripped off Chuck Berry long before anyone had ever heard of Elvis Presley--that its almost impossible to discern whether theres anything decent about the moviemaking itself. With everything so wrong how can there be anything right about Cadillac Records?

Plus Cadillac Records hits its groove. By David Edelstein Published Nov 30 2008 ShareThis (Photo Ralph Nelson/Universal Pictures) Somewhereperhaps in the netherworld rats gnawing on his kidneys awaiting the arrival of his friend HenryRichard Nixon is smiling at the thought of being played by the grave sonorous still-handsome Frank Langella. For all his attempted gravitas Nixon was a shifty-eyed lightweight and transparent phony whereas Langella is a born Shakespearean. Finally Nixon has the stature that eluded him in life In the film of his play Frost/Nixon Peter Morgan elevates the 1977 interviews Nixon gave (or rather sold for an unheard-of 600000) to English TV personality David Frost into a momentous event in the history of politics and media. His conceit is to frame the whole spectacle as a championship boxing match with coaches in each mans corner (Kevin Bacon as Nixon man Jack Brennan Sam Rockwell and Oliver Platt as Team Frosts James Reston Jr. and Bob Zelnick). Frost and Nixon have one huge thing in common They each need a showbiz comeback. But Nixons object is to redeem himself (or failing that run out the clock) Frosts is to get Nixon to admit that he was what hed assured the American people he wasnt (and would never thanks to Gerald Ford be convicted of being) a crook. Theres also a Rocky element Will the playboy and gadabout Frost (played by Michael Sheen) cram for the final interview on Watergate and score a knockout or will he let Nixon continue to talk circles around him and win on points? In the theater Frost/Nixon had the trappings of a Big Deal Langellas reverberant presence a sardonic narrator in Reston and a bank of monitors that created a tension between the live performance and its video translation. The film directed rather impersonally by Ron Howard is brisk well crafted and enjoyable enough but the characters seem thinner (Sheen is all frozen smiles and squirms) and the outcome less consequential. As in Morgans screenplays for The Queen and Longford the theme is the collision of venerable authority figures and a modern media that (in their view) cheapens and distorts everything that they stand for. Does the camera trivializeor does it pick up truths the human eye rarely sees as starkly? Did it caricature Nixon who loathed it or penetrate to his crooked soul? Resonant questionsbut at this point why should we care that Frost salvaged a minor TV career by getting the guilty-as-sin Nixon to acknowledge after hours of prodding for which he was exorbitantly compensated that he let the American people down? In terms of its impact on the electorate (and the relations between politicians and the media) the Nixon-Frost interviews have been dwarfed by the meeting of Katie Couric and Sarah Palin in which the interview subject was so surreally deficient that routine follow-ups became gotcha questions. Even Nixon would have been appalled. Frost/Nixon is unsatisfying even if like me youre a lifelong aficionado of Nixon-bashing. Morgan makes him out to be a Great White Whale but when he sat down with Frost Nixon was already dead in the waterconvicted by his own words in White House transcripts to the point where even his Republican allies had long deserted him. And with selective editing Morgan makes it seem as if Frost got Nixon to admit more than he actually did. The original Watergate interview is now on DVD and there are self-exculpatory escape clauses in every interminable circumlocutory utterance. When Frost read aloud from the White House transcripts Nixons eyes darted around as he searched his brain for linguistic loopholes. In Frost/Nixon Langellas heavy features move slowly; he seems to be plumbing the depths of his soul and glimpsing for an instant the abyss. Alas the shit that dribbles from Langellas mouth is still Tricky Dicks. Darnell Martins Cadillac Records tells the story of Chicagos Chess Records and the seminal blues artists it launched among them Muddy Waters Little Walter Howlin Wolf Chuck Berry and Etta James. The film moves swiftly and leaves out details but that barely matters. The ensemble is stupendoushowlingly greatand the music goes deep. The major themes are beautifully worked out. First recorded in Mississippi by folk historian Alan Lomax Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) takes his act on the road and winds up in Chicago in the fifties working with Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody) the Polish-Jewish emigre with a fondness for blues and Cadillacswhich he bestows on his successful artists often in lieu of paychecks. Martin handles Chesss possible duplicity (as opposed to spaciness) vaguely but that ends up working for the film As progressive as he is in collaborating with African-Americans Chess acts as if they shouldnt need to worry their little heads about money which they wouldnt know how to handle anyway. As they move from the plantation to the recording studio to segregated and then desegregated halls these artists are at once wildly potenttheir music takes people someplace so goood they want to get nakedand infantilized. They act out in different ways with booze or smack or sex or violence; theyre not yet fully liberated. (There would be many lawsuits to come.) The framing device (the story is told by Cedric the Entertainer as Willie Dixon) isnt fresh and the film isnt everything it should be visually The compositions feel hemmed-in TV-ish instead of sinuous and febrile. But the soundtracka mix of re-creations and originalstakes you places movies rarely go. After a run of bland big-money roles Wright reminds us what an astounding character actor he is. He does the Brando thingpuffed-out cheeks and a thick tongue with a staccato mumble. Columbus Shorts Little Walter comes at you with the showboat fury of Walters harmonica; Eamonn Walkers gravel-voiced Howlin Wolf is lycanthropically inspired; and if Mos Defs Chuck Berry isnt especially Berryish its Mos at his funniest and loopiest. The surprise is Beyonce Knowles who is not the gorgeous self-contained non-actress weve come to know but a plush pincushion who can barely contain her resentment. Cadillac Records could be three times as long and wouldnt spread its miracles too thin. Frost/Nixon Directed by Ron Howard. Universal Pictures. R. Cadillac Records Directed by Darnell Martin.

Approaching the blues with the enthusiasm of an overcaffeinated brass band helmer Darnell Martin nonetheless makes some kind of music with the percolating 50s biopic ""Cadillac Records"" -- mostly because she mines a righteous mythic sensibility out of the story of Leonard Chess Muddy Waters and the birth of the Chicago blues. Jeffrey Wrights Waters is unforgettable Eamonn Walker gives an unnerving performance as rival bluesman Howlin Wolf and Beyonce Knowles Etta James should put bottoms in seats. The second feature this year to focus on the same musicians ""Cadillac Records"" takes a far broader approach than Jerry Zaks ""Who Do You Love"" which concentrated more on the conflicted character of Chess than on the artists he hired promoted profited from and some say exploited. In ""Cadillac Records"" Adrien Brody cuts an appropriately oily figure as the man who founded Chess Records in 1956 while Wright delivers a performance of eloquent simmering dignity as Waters -- the first Chess star one of the great vocalists in American music and the dramatic engine of Martins film. Working off her own well-researched screenplay Martin goes so far as to have Chess path crossed by shadowy muttering figures. ""Ive lost daughters to bluesmen"" they warn him outside the black nightclub he plans to open. ""Its a dangerous business you in."" No kidding At the Club Macambo where Chess starts booking local talent the so-called Headhunters barge in -- Waters harmonica virtuoso Little Walter (Columbus Short) and guitarist Jimmy Rogers (Kevin Mambo). They take over the stage fists are thrown and someone pulls a gun. Chess does the smart politic thing and hires the invaders. He also starts recording Waters whose ""I Cant Be Satisfied"" puts them all on the map. Bookending narration provided by Cedric the Entertainer seriously miscast as the great songwriter Willie Dixon tells the story of Chess expansion his paying off of disc jockeys his fostering of the unstable Little Walter Waters marriage to steady long-suffering Geneva Wade (Gabrielle Union) the clash between Waters and Howlin Wolf (by all accounts one of the most ferocious blues performers ever -- and Walker makes you believe it) and the eventual signing of the troubled James (Knowles) whose ""At Last"" becomes one of the labels real crossover hits. One suspects Martin is a convert one who might have come to the blues unconvinced but came away a fire-and-brimstone evangelist for the music and its people -- which is good because an overfamiliarity with the minutiae might have strangled what is on a very basic level a solid story. Most of the details are right-on in ""Cadillac Records"" though the directors efforts to sell it sometimes steers the film into mawkish or hokey territory. Where its dead serious though is as a racial parable that couldnt be timelier. Chess Records was a mixed marriage -- the owner was a Polish immigrant his artists were African-American and much of the America they inhabited was hostile to any such arrangement. This all comes to a head after Chess signs Chuck Berry (a dryly funny Mos Def) whose hybridized pop sound had some promoters thinking he was a white country singer. Berry is the guy who puts Chess over the top; as someone says theyre not sure what hes playing but its not the blues. But it sells and it bridges the racial divide In a scene duplicated in ""Who Do You Love"" the velvet ropes separating whites and blacks at a Berry concert are toppled by the audience. That Martin later has Knowles reprise the entire racial psychology of America through James and her seemingly insoluble identity problems by contrast is overkill; Knowles gives a soulful portrayal but her part of the movie seems to exist in another dimension entirely. As Waters self-destructive protege Short brings blood and soul to a classic role -- a kind of prince of the blues who eventually becomes torn over whether to revere the king or dethrone him. The music -- most of it performed by the actors themselves -- has a real richness to it if not quite the muscle of the Chess records themselves. Recording sessions are shot like live concerts; the club gigs feel sweaty and smoky. And Defs Berry performances succeed in capturing what it felt like when the blues had a baby and they named it rock n roll.
