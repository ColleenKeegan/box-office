Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis star as Joe in ""Looper"" a time travel thriller.Story highlights""Looper"" is a hit-man thriller with a time travel conceitJoseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis play younger and older versions of the same character""Loopers"" excellent supporting cast includes Emily Blunt Jeff Daniels and Noah SeganIf you saw Joseph Gordon-Levitt in ""Premium Rush"" or ""The Dark Knight Rises"" this summer you will be surprised at how different he looks in ""Looper"" a hit-man thriller with a time travel conceit.Gordon-Levitt looks older and more mature somehow with a high forehead a more pronounced nose and a way of pursing his lips in a faintly ironic scowl. The reasons for his makeover become apparent when his character Joe comes face to face with his older self played by Bruce Willis higher forehead same nose same scowl. Its enough to put even the sharpest hit man (or ""looper"") off his aim. And Old Joe gets away which is a problem because if Young Joe doesnt rectify the situation and fulfill his contract he wont qualify for the 30-year retirement plan thats allowed Old Joe such a long and fruitful life. Theyll both be cut off in their prime.The first film in four years from ""Brick"" and ""Brothers Bloom"" writer-director Rian Johnson ""Looper"" is a smart suspense movie. Its essentially a low-tech variation on themes from ""The Terminator"" but ingenious enough to feel fresh intriguing and even bewildering at times.Most flicks are so predictable you could set your watch by them ... if you still had a watch (Joe has a silver pocket watch but hes a slave to retro fashion). Johnson adopts an arrestingly bold and unusual structure introducing two major characters an hour in and employing telekinesis when it seems the time travel thing is getting old.JUST WATCHEDReviews of Looper Bond collectionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHReviews of Looper Bond collection 0351JUST WATCHEDConan Actor photobombs the presidentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHConan Actor photobombs the president 0010But his readiness to make us stretch should not blind us to the fact that ""Looper"" is full of holes time holes holes for corpse disposal and enough plot holes to fill a leaky bucket. It is set confusingly 30 years from now in a low-budget future that looks like a more broken down version of our present (give or take a few flying motor vehicles).Time travel has not been invented but in another 30 years it will be -- that is in 2070 -- and the Mob has taken to sending their marked men back in time to be dispatched by loopers and disposed of in Joes less-regimented present. Confused? You will be.It doesnt matter. It doesnt even matter that nobody thought to make Gordon-Levitts earlobes resemble Willis (if youve seen ""The Imposter"" youll know thats a dead giveaway). Its fun being flummoxed and Johnson has a knack for pulling off short snappy scenes that keep the drama percolating (the excellent supporting cast including Emily Blunt Jeff Daniels and Noah Segan also helps).Yes its a B movie sci-fi thriller but not many prestige pictures have this much going on underneath the surface.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

"Looper movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Time-traveling Looper starts strong remains intriguing September 27 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticFor about an hour ""Looper"" really cooks. Its second half is more of a medium boil and less fun. But watching it I realized how few commercial entertainments hold up straight through to the end-point.Even a clever and idiosyncratic filmmaker such as Rian Johnson the writer-director of ""Looper"" must feel the pressure (especially with Bruce Willis and a lot of bullets involved) to deliver the body-count payoffs in a way that satisfies genre expectations.Still and in ways that make the results worth seeing That first hour cooks. And the second hour brings Emily Blunt into the story which is a fine thing for any second half to offer.Far beyond the retro stylizations of his earlier films -- the Dashiell Hammett-soaked ""Brick"" (2006) and the madcap-heiress picaresque ""The Brothers Bloom"" (2009) -- Johnsons third feature plays make-believe for keeps. This is a time-travel movie. For a large swath of the moviegoing population especially the fantasists and futurists among us time-travel is as strong a hook as ""boy meets girl"" or ""the show must go on"" or ""whoever opposes Liam Neeson must pay.""Set in Kansas in 2044 the urbanscape in ""Looper"" resembles a grungy brutal Oz surrounded by soothingly retro farm country. In this future time-travel hasnt yet been discovered but 30 years later by the 2070s it has and its in the illegal hands of the gangster underworld. To snuff out an adversary poof Send him back to 2044 with a bag on his head and there standing at the ready with a nasty rifle called the ""Blunderbuss"" is the ""looper"" the gun for hire.The star of ""Brick"" six years ago Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays the looper Joe. The work has begun to wear him down. Hes a drug addict. He knows that eventually hell be assigned to ""close his loop"" and kill off the 30-years-later version of himself. The day arrives. Bruce Willis plays the older Joe who arrives ready for extermination without his hood. Younger Joe flinches; older Joe escapes. The chase is on and younger Joe has things he must learn about his fate and the fate (inevitable? malleable?) of his world.Johnson sets all this up extremely well. The glimpses of the technology were afforded in ""Looper"" notably the hovercrafts are fleeting and evocative. The picture is a modest triumph of midsize budgeting and sparing effects that dont compete with the human beings. The violence for a while comes in fast brutal bursts neither sadistic nor jocular in tone.Gordon-Levitt wearing subtle and artful makeup that nudges his face closer to that of a young Bruce Willis is an actor who truly interacts with his fellow performers. Here they range from Jeff Daniels (an amusingly off-handed gangland leader) to Blunt atypically cast but wholly convincing as a weathered but great-looking farm widow raising a preteen boy whose place in the story remains either a mystery or a bit of a muddle depending on how much you like that second half.Theres a lot going on here including scenes of Older Joe and his wife (Summer Qing) and footage shot in Shanghai. (The bulk of ""Looper"" was filmed in New Orleans.) Johnsons story brings in telekinesis elements of ""Shane"" and in the less inspired action sequences gamer-style slaughter thats not nearly as sharp or exciting as the best Johnson creates in the earlier sequences. Through it all though ""Looper"" returns to a tantalizing prospect. What if two halves of one person a younger version and an older version were able to converse over a cup of coffee? What would you tell your junior self?If the first half of ""Looper"" could talk to the second half it would probably say Dont overcomplicate. Even so the actors are excellent. And Johnsons ambitions remain bracingly high.mjphillipstribune.comLooper -- 3 starsMPAA rating R (for strong violence language some sexuality/nudity and drug content)Running time 158Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesToronto film fest opens with shows of forceSeptember 6 2012Toronto film festival promises action India AffleckJuly 25 2012UPDATE 1-Actress Kristen Stewart steals limelight as...September 7 2012Actress Kristen Stewart steals limelight as Toronto film...September 7 2012Crix mix it up at Toronto Varietys Peter Debruge and...September 17 2012Find More Stories AboutTime TravelBruce WillisRian JohnsonTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter",http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-27/entertainment/sc-mov-0925-looper-20120927_1_rian-johnson-looper-younger-joe,200,looper2,looper,chicagotribune

Time travel stories tend to give me a headache. Im a big fan of the classic ones -- ""The Time Machine"" ""Time and Again"" -- but when tales start introducing parallel realities and alternative futures I start reaching for the Bayer. ""Looper"" gave me a bit of a twinge too to be honest. But I didnt mind it that much. The film has one of the more potentially confounding plot devices in sci-fi -- someone going back in time and meeting himself -- and its overstuffed with ideas. (Theres a huge subplot about telekinesis that ultimately feels like it was left over from another movie.) But the storys told with great style. And even if it has too much going on ... well how many times have you suffered through a big noisy sci-fi film that in the end had nothing going on? The signs of intelligent minds at work are right there on the poster. ""Looper"" is written and directed by Rian Johnson; it stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The two first collaborated on the movie ""Brick"" a too-clever-by-half hard-boiled high-school mystery. Theyre back for this similarly high-concept genre film a futuristic thriller thats actually set in two futures -- 2044 and 2074. The criminals living in 2074 you see use a time machine to send their targets into the past where their 2044 allies kill them. This is sort of where my headache began -- the scheme seems incredibly overcomplicated and destined to go wrong. Yet Gordon-Levitt -- a sly slight secretly amused actor -- is an interesting choice as the 2044 assassin. And the plot gets even more interesting when he meets his next target -- the 2074 version of himself played by Bruce Willis -- who then gets away. The one real-world problem with this setup is that we know what Bruce Willis looked like roughly 30 years ago. And that was basically Bruce Willis but with more hair. The films attempt to make Gordon-Levitt resemble him is both obvious (contact lenses and made-up eyebrows play a big part) and inconsistent. Why not simply cast an older actor who looked more like the younger one? Because Im afraid Willis still spells ""action movie"" to a certain aging segment of the movie-going audience. (Although is that really the audience a film as trippy as ""Looper"" is going for?) In any case things take a dark and twisted turn when Willis decides ""Terminator"" style to rewrite his future by killing someone from his past. And Gordon-Levitt decides the only way he can insure his present survival is by murdering the future him. Its not always easy to follow. But it is entertaining -- as is big bearded Jeff Daniels in a small plum role as a ruthless gangster and Emily Blunt as a plucky farmer. And so is Johnsons visual style which conflates 30s gangsters and modern techno parties. The film still feels a bit like a jumble of separate parts (a few of the supporting performances are awkwardly over the top). And Willis almost superhuman machismo plays like pandering both to the aging movie star and his fans. But Gordon-Levitt is as cool as a cucumber martini the films look is fresh and its solution to its tricky plot is in its own way finally elegant. And if the whole thing leaves you rubbing your temples just a bit ... well this headaches sort of worth it. Ratings note The film contains violence drug use and sexual situations.

Whats to think about time isnt linear we only perceive it that way there is no pas or future only present just masses of decay. Like the saying goes whats done is done. Samimsaid on Saturday January 19 2013 11102 AMI really cant believe you critiques. You are self acclaimed to be some sort of judge. Clearly your IQ is 50 and you dont have power to understand any complicated plot. Looper has so many loopholes that I can prove you the story itself is flawed. Yet u are not able to recognize it becoz you have IQ of a 2 year kid. Richsaid on Friday October 26 2012 101659 AMI thought the annoying young mob guy was going to be the older mob guy from the future (Daniels) as his younger self. When Daniels smashed the youngins hand with a hammer I was waiting for the older guy to then hold up a smashed hand (get it?). Anyway I enjoyed the flick and the time travel looping sure gave us something to think about with timelines both written and unwritten and the tenuousness of them both. David in Dallassaid on Monday October 15 2012 80331 PMAbsolutely fantastic movie. Great themes. Great symbolism. Great casting. Mind-bending plot line. Heart wrenching humanity. Butt kicking action. Really enjoyed this movie more than I anticipated. Tom Christensensaid on Saturday October 13 2012 115957 AMI enjoyed the movie right until the little kid appeared. I found Pierce Gagnon extremely creepy and would have shot him myself in a heartbeat. Plus Emily Blunts character was quite annoying as someone who would defend her child even though he was the spawn of satin. Reeblitesaid on Wednesday October 10 2012 20635 PMgood review. as an older female viewer the subliminal (blank dont want to give it away) issue undertones which comes full circle at the end a paradox coming from such violence making perfect sense makes this a thought provoking movie throughout and the deepest sci fi flick to date. found it too loud in two shotgun shot instances to the point of physical irritability which Im sure is intentional? but not pleasant as a movie goer. will definitely rent it when it comes out but should be seen on big screen for full effect. Kyle Fasenmyersaid on Monday October 01 2012 114314 AMJust wanted to give a second opinion on the comment. Id have to agree with some of the characters just being awful. Without giving away any spoilers one throw away character lasted the entire film just to be a plot device at the very end to distract young Joe long enough to set up for the climax. I hated him and how uselessly imposed he felt into the entire story. Once again avoiding spoilers I just was generally dissatisfied with the child as a whole all felt very silly. I thought this had some fantastic ideas but a few weak points in the script and awkward character would make it a B for me. I still really enjoyed it and will be purchasing it when released. But given the choice in Sci FI Id rather see inception. Given by the director Brick. Dillon Avnetsaid on Saturday September 29 2012 30453 PMRichard I loved Looper and I thought it was the best sci-fi film since Inception. In my mind it was an A+. I respect your review.

Film District""I dont want to talk about time-travel shit"" Bruce Willis tells Joseph Gordon-Levitt early in Rian Johnsons sci-fi thriller Looper. ""Because if we start were going to be here all day making diagrams with straws.""Its a good bit of advice and the film itself is generally wise enough to take it. As the title suggests Looper has its share of fun with the convolutions and conundrums that take place when folks from the future start tinkering with the past. (One clever and unsettling example involves people etching scars into their own flesh as a means of sending an indelible message to their future selves.) But the movie never allows itself to get bogged down in questions about the physics or philosophy of time travel the what-ifs and how-comes and why-didnts. Leave the structural analysis for the DVD commentary. For all its temporal shenanigans Looper is to be enjoyed in the moment.For all its temporal shenanigans Looper is to be enjoyed in the moment. Gordon-Levitt and Willis star respectively as a contract killer named Joe and a former contract killer named Joe--the same guy in fact just separated by three decades of hard-won experience. The movie is set in 2044 the era of the younger Joe who opens the movie by informing us that ""Time travel hasnt been invented yet. But in 30 years it will have been."" For all the obvious reasons the practice is immediately outlawed. (Or is that ""will immediately have been outlawed""? This is a movie that has one grasping at verb tenses.) The perverse effect in a perhaps unintentional nod to the old NRA adage is that only outlaws use time travel. Specifically the criminal syndicates of the future a period in which it has become extremely difficult to dispose of dead bodies undetected begin sending their victims back in time to 2044 where Joe and other ""loopers"" can blow them away with impunity. As jobs go its not so bad Joe stands in a field with his pocket watch; waits for his cuffed and hooded prey to appear on the tarp hes carefully laid out; and blammo Or at least its not so bad relative to the other employment opportunities available in 2044 which seem to consist primarily of hobo and hooker. The sullen retro-futurism on display in Looper will be familiar to anyone whos seen Blade Runner The Road Warrior or their many imitators. City streets--and their denizens--are gray with grime; high-tech hover bikes are rare but old-school shotguns ubiquitous.There is however one catch to Joes profession In order to tie up loose ends the crime syndicates that employ the loopers eventually require them to kill their own future selves--to ""close the loop."" And when Joes future self shows up on his tarp one day hes none to eager to have his loop closed.Its a neat little setup. After Old Joe (again played by Willis) escapes his rendezvous with mortality Young Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is held accountable by his none-too-forgiving boss (Jeff Daniels). So Young Joe is tasked with finding and killing Old Joe even as Old Joe is trying to keep Young Joe alive--because a dead Young Joe means that Old Joe ceases to exist. And for any whose heads are not yet spinning writer-director Johnson throws in another loop or two In the future Old Joes wife was killed by a mysterious Keyser-Soze-like crime lord called the Rainmaker; now that hes back in the past Old Joe is determined to find this villain as a boy and snuff him out before he can grow into deadly manhood. But Young Joe falls in love with boys mother (Emily Blunt) a tough resourceful farm gal and he commits to protecting her and her son from the threat posed by his own future self...

If not dont sweat it. Therell be plenty of time to diagram the whole thing with straws after you leave the theater. First though a few words about the non-time-travel-related question most likely to be on viewers lips What the hell happened to Joseph Gordon-Levitts face? Rest assured the appealing young star (who got his big cinematic break in Johnsons first film Brick) has suffered no motorcycle crash followed by problematic reconstructive surgery. Rather Johnson asked makeup artist Kazuhiro Tsuji to increase Gordon-Levitts physical resemblance to Willis--in particular his distinctive Roman nose--and Tsuji succeeded depending on ones point of view either too well or not quite well enough. In either case were deep into the uncanny valley here with Gordon-Levitt calling to mind less Willis himself than a Willis marionette that didnt make the final cut of Team America World Police. Happily Johnsons decision to have Gordon-Levitt go the full Dyan Cannon is an uncharacteristic misstep in an otherwise sharp and self-assured film. Though Looper carries the echoes of many earlier entertainments--The Terminator Blade Runner Logans Run Witness Williss own Twelve Monkeys--it is a fresh and vivid work of imagination and a return to form for Johnson following the awkward misfire of 2008s The Brothers Bloom. With Looper Johnson offers up a mind-bending ride that is not afraid to slow down now and again to explore themes of regret and redemption solitude and sacrifice love and loss. Its a movie worth seeing and perhaps going back to see again.

Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place.

Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

In the midst of it there was a lull and feeling exhausted all of a sudden I got up and left the living room. In the bedroom I immediately fell face down into the sheets. The next thing I knew it was 20 minutes later and my wife was shaking me awake. I hadnt meant to fall asleep; I just felt so fatigued in that moment that there was nothing else I could do. This wasnt new for me. A few weeks earlier I had come into conflict with an acquaintance over some money. We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

It doesnt take long into the futuristic thriller ""Looper"" to declare ""Finally A movie that comes with the dark energy of a Philip K. Dick story without having to return to that long-departed writer whose work inspired Blade Runner Total Recall Minority Report and The Adjustment Bureau to name a few."" Sure it has the debris-strewn streets of a decaying society. Yes cultural dissipation abounds in a town where young men in natty attire zip past the Wild West interactions of less-fortunate denizens on their way to a night of strip-club and drug action. And yet from its casting to its fondness for the retro cadences of noir fiction it is absolutely the work of writer-director Rian Johnson. The 38-year-old director (whose dad Craig Johnson calls Colorado home) came on the scene in 2005 with indie darling ""Brick"" a detective tale set amid high-schoolers. Joseph Gordon-Levitt starred. ""Looper"" reteams the two. Looper isnt a name but a nasty occupation. The year is 2044 and though time travel does not yet exist it will in 30 more years when the mob will employ the illegal activity to off rivals. Turns out those future gangsters like things tidy. So at some point they ""close the loop."" That is they send the hit mans older self back to 2044. He gets whacked and the clock begins winding down on the younger selfs life. Hes got 30 years then boom. (Why is there always a little something three-card monte about time-travel flicks?) Every now and again a looper cant help himself and helps himself He lets his older self ""run."" This happens to Paul Danos character the jangle-nerved Seth. Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is a looper living the life. He has retirement plans. He has a stash of the currency of his trade. He wields a massive gun called a blunderbuss lousy at a distance lethal up close. And Joes work is intimate. He stands in a corn field looking at his watch. A man appears on a drop cloth hog-tied his head covered in a sack. Boom. When Older Joe lands in front of Joe a pause leads to a chase of cosmic proportions. Jeff Daniels plays Joes employer who is non-too forgiving of loopers letting their older selves escape. Bruce Willis portrays Older Joe and the face-offs between Gordon-Levitt and Willis are the stuff of a know-it-all dad and a rebellious son. Only what they share is far more complicated. Johnson was savvy enough to know Gordon-Levitts brown eyes are the wrong kind of asset here. The gray eyes of his character make him not quite the actor we love in movies from ""(500) Days of Summer"" to ""50.50"" to ""The Dark Knight Rises."" ""Looper"" has more heart than ""Brick"" and the 2008 con-man flick ""The Brothers Bloom."" Both fine achievements they could also be described as viscerally cerebral. Much of that warmth comes by way of Emily Blunt. Her Sara is the vigilant mother of a strangely gifted young boy who Older Joe is sure holds the key to his future.

Rian Johnsons ""Looper"" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as a bounty hunter who in 2044 is in the unenviable position of having to kill off the 30-year-older version of himself played by Bruce Willis.The fact that Gordon-Levitt and Willis dont look anything alike is I suppose part of the weirdness (although Gordon-Levitts make-up job tries to bridge the gap).I suppose we should all be grateful for the heads-up that according to ""Looper"" time travel will be possible in 2074.

"Looper reviewed Joseph Gordon-Levitt meets his future-self and hes Bruce Willis. Slate Sign In Sign Up Joseph Gordon-Levitt Meets His Future-Self aka Bruce Willis in Looper Joseph Gordon-Levitt Meets His Future-Self aka Bruce Willis in Looper Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Sept. 28 2012 854 AM Looper Joseph Gordon-Levitt meets his future-self and hes Bruce Willis. By Dana Stevens Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Looper. Photo by Alan Markfield/DMG Entertainment/Looper LLC. After youve seen Looper come back and listen to our Spoiler Special podcast with Dana Stevens and Dan Kois. You can also download the podcast. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Looper is the third film from Rian Johnson whose debut feature Brick (2005) somehow pulled off the brazen gimmick of setting a noir murder mystery in a suburban American high school. Joseph Gordon-Levitt (then known to most audiences as the alien kid on the family sitcom Third Rock from the Sun) played the lead role--a teenage Sam Spade investigating his girlfriends murder--with an alchemically perfect combination of hip detachment and wary melancholy. Gordon-Levitt was already a rising actor having been singled out by critics in less-mainstream roles like the gay drifter he played in Gregg Arakis moody unforgettable Mysterious Skin. But it was only after Brick that he began his steady rise toward household-name status playing a lovelorn greeting-card designer in (500) Days of Summer a brain-cancer patient in 50/50 and a credible action sidekick in both Inception and The Dark Knight Rises. Im an avowed JGL fan so the prospect of Gordon-Levitt and Johnson working together again was enticing. So was Loopers high-concept sci-fi premise Gordon-Levitt plays a hired assassin whose targets are sent back in time from the future. Its 2044 and time travel hasnt yet been invented but--to employ the future-perfect tense useful mainly for time-travel movies--it will have been invented in 30 years. By that point a fearful vaguely post-apocalyptic government will have forbidden any use of the technology ... so to paraphrase the NRA bumper sticker when time machines are outlawed only outlaws will have time machines. Soon the contraptions (which look pleasingly like Jules Verne-era bathyspheres) are used solely on the black market transporting the human garbage of the future back in time for the past to clean up. At least thats how Joe (Gordon-Levitt) justifies to himself the fact that he makes his living waiting in deserted fields for hooded cuffed men to appear out of nowhere so he can shoot them with a blunderbuss. Advertisement Underground assassins like Joe--members of an organized force led by menacing boss-from-the-future Abe (Jeff Daniels)--are known as ""loopers"" for the chilling reason that after being paid handsomely and given an early retirement that lasts exactly 30 years they themselves will be captured sent back in time and killed thus closing the ""loop"" of their lives. As the film begins a new crime lord a fearsome gangster known as the Rainmaker has taken over in the future and is issuing new orders about the existing loopers He wants all their future selves sent back in time and killed immediately preferably by the younger versions of themselves. (Why exactly this setup would be desirable was one plot point among many that eluded me. Given that the victims from the future are being sent back with their heads covered why would it matter which looper killed whom?) Joes featherbrained fellow looper Seth (Paul Dano) encountering his own later-self isnt able to bring himself to pull the trigger and the man gets away resulting in a very bad outcome for both present and future Seths (and the first of several extended bursts of stomach-churning violence). Joe resolves that when and if his own future self appears in cuffs before him he wont hesitate to blow him away--but when that day comes and Joes future self turns out to be Bruce Willis all bets are off. Future Joe manages to knock Past Joe out cold take his gun and head out into the world to find and kill the child destined one day to grow into the Rainmaker. Based on a tip about the super-criminals date and place of birth old Joe has narrowed the candidates down to three small children one of whom (Pierce Gagnon) is the son of a lonely sugarcane farmer (Emily Blunt) in whose barn young Joe has taken shelter while on the run from Abes men who are now hunting down both Joes with extreme prejudice. You see where this is going At some point Young Joe and Old Joe are going to have to meet up and debrief about the 30 years that separate them then decide whether theyre going to continue as allies or enemies. The moment this finally happens in an Edward Hopper-esque diner in the middle of nowhere was for me the movies high point. As they stare at each other in profile over two identical plates of steak and eggs Willis and Gordon-Levitt such different types both physically and temperamentally make a strange sense as each others time-traveling avatars especially since were meant to imagine that Joes years of hard living to come will make him a coarser tougher man in middle age. (Levitt was also fitted with facial prosthetics to make his fine-boned face more closely resemble Willis craggier features. The nose works; the eyebrows are pushing it.) The diner scene also snaps with smart dialogue that playfully bats around sci-fi cliches; asked by his 2044 self to explicate one of the paradoxes of time travel 2074 Joe impatiently dismisses the question insisting they have no time to ""start making diagrams with straws."" Too bad because a well-thought-out straw diagram might have been able to get me through the movies last half-hour in which timeless philosophical questions of free will vs. destiny nature vs. nurture and utilitarian ethics (would you consider killing a child if you knew it meant saving countless future lives from the monster he might grow up to be?) get raised then chucked aside as the story hurtles to a rushed gory conclusion that leaves nearly as many plot holes as bullet holes. Saddest of all after their juicy mid-movie encounter at the diner Old and Young Joe hardly ever share the screen again and when they do its mostly to exchange terse remarks and gunfire. Looper felt to me like a maddening near-miss It posits an impossible but fascinating-to-imagine relationship--a face-to-face encounter between ones present and future self in which each self must account for its betrayal of the other--and then throws away nearly all the dramatic potential that relationship offers. If someone remakes Looper as the movie it could have been in say 30 years will someone from the future please FedEx it back to me? Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

"Looper review A head flip of a time trip | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLooper review A head flip of a time tripLooper this years TIFF gala starter now opening wide imperils both past and future with its head-rattling existential smarts. As sci-fi films go its definitely not your usual time trip.Bruce Willis right is seen with Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the science fiction thriller ""Looper.""By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 28 2012Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Bruce Willis Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels. Written and directed by Rian Johnson. At GTA theatres. 118 minutes. ""This time travel crap just fries your brain like an egg"" a weary Jeff Daniels observes in Looper and aint it the truth?Whether its the usual sci-fi trope of the future messing with the past (12 Monkeys The Terminator) or the rarer one of the past invading the future (Time After Time) the complicated logistics invite the very present administration of Advil. Related Interview with Bruce WillisNone more so than Looper this years TIFF gala starter now opening wide which imperils both past and future with its mind-rattling existential smarts. Its a head flip of a time trip.Article Continued BelowSkilfully bending genres since he first smashed with the high-school neo-noir Brick in 2005 writer/director Rian Johnson puts that films star Joseph Gordon-Levitt into an identity-crisis thriller set in the Kansas of 2044. Gordon-Levitt is Joe almost unrecognizable under makeup. Hes a ""looper"" (hit man) working for innovative mobsters of the year 2074 who use an illegal time machine to send their victims back three decades for bullets and burning. Loopers are handsomely paid with silver bars that arrive strapped to the mobs victims.""They zap em back to me and I do the necessaries"" says ice-cool Joe who dresses like a 1980s rockabilly player employs a weirdly primitive blunderbuss and who hankers to retire to France (hes learning French). He takes a similarly retro approach to his ""necessaries"" which are administered on a plastic sheet next to a cornfield.Theres something odd about this future Kansas too. Although jet-propulsion motor bikes and telekinesis are now available most people seem to prefer 20th-century pickups and regular brain power. And Joe works for Abe (Daniels) a cynical Scotch-swilling mob bureaucrat from 2074 who unhappily resides in 2044 so he can keep an eye on the loopers.Johnson is determined to keep us on our toes as we happily negotiate his rewritten rules of time travel. For him its OK for past and future versions of people to physically interact even though the accepted convention makes such a tangle explosively akin to mixing matter and antimatter. His best trick is the concept of ""closing the loop"" which is what happens when a looper is assigned to rub out his future self. For this hes paid in gold bars that will ensure an affluent lifestyle for the few remaining decades hes now rationed himself to. But when its Joes turn to confront the mirror through the untimely and elusive arrival of his older self (Bruce Willis) things get more than a little complicated. Especially since Older Joe is on a mission to stop the rise of a future mob leader known as the Rainmaker whose brutal rule in 2074 makes getting older seem more terrifying than inevitable.The showdown between 20-something Joe and 50-something Joe introduces ""who am I?"" emotion and drama to the film upping the intellectual ante without sacrificing the shoot-em-up thrills. Less satisfying is the role played by Emily Blunt as single farmer Sara who attracts both the younger and older Joes for different reasons.

This part of the film seems more of an interlude and also as a set-up to a likely Looper sequel.Still Looper gives us more than enough to chew on even if it fails to close every loophole.

"Looper (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Looper (R) Get ready to be thrown for a loop Bruce Willis left and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Looper. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/27/2012 Editor rating 3.5 In the lively imaginative Looper director Rian Johnson takes a huge leap in stock from his previous two somewhat precious movies (Brick and The Brothers Bloom). This is an exciting exceptionally well-made futuristic thriller that also happens to be loaded with lived-in touches and punchy ideas proof that Johnson has thought this material out carefully and considered all possible angles. The ones he chooses will surprise you. The film is set in Kansas 2044 when time travel hasnt yet been invented. It will be soon though and immediately deemed illegal. But the mob comes up with an ingenious use for the hoary sci-fi staple using it to send prisoners back to a cornfield in 2044 a bag over their heads and their hands tied behind their back where a ""looper"" waits with a shotgun to execute them. The first third of Looper fills in the details of the movies world -- the lower-class is now homeless foraging for food in the streets -- while centering on Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a looper who has few friends (Paul Dano plays one of them). Joe is stashing his money away for something -- retirement? fleeing the country? -- and is addicted to a drug dispensed via eye drops that has become the new crack. Using contact lenses and subtle but noticeable prosthetics Gordon-Levitt looks different than normal which helps distance us from the usually warm and likable actor. Joe is a killer for hire which makes him a not-nice guy. But hes quiet and follows orders and doesnt cause a fuss until his latest assignment pops up on a Kansas field An older version of himself (Bruce Willis) who manages to free himself and escape through the cornfields. Having young Joe and old Joe running around in the same time period is known as an ""open loop"" which is a huge no-no for the crime boss (an amusing Jeff Daniels) running the outfit. In one of the films best scenes the two Joes meet at a diner to discuss their predicament (when you see them together you realize Gordon-Levitts makeup was used to make him look more like Willis). But there is no possible solution that can please both men and so Looper becomes a chase movie in which the protagonist is trying to kill his elder self while the mature Joe is trying to find a loophole to alter the past so he can change the present. Willis who often coasts through action movies without even pretending to seem interested is completely invested here doing dark bad things that a lot of A-list actors would decline to do. Gordon-Levitt who becomes a stronger and more substantial presence with every movie he makes makes a worthy opponent (or is he the hero?) often thinking one step ahead of his prey which is probably not that hard since he is chasing himself. Instead of opting for a giant action-filled climax Johnson sets the final third of Looper on a remote farm where a single mother (Emily Blunt) is raising her son. The director uses practical effects whenever he can -- the gore which is plentiful looks real -- but he does neat things with computer-generated images too including one astonishing scene near the end involving telekinesis that is one of the most striking images in any film this year. As its title implies Looper eventually paints itself into a corner and Johnsons solution is not as satisfying as youd like it to be. But that feels like a gripe when compared to the rest of the film which is the sort of fast-paced engrossing genre movie that engages you emotionally and intellectually instead of just trying to dazzle you.

Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Emily Blunt Bruce Willis Piper Perabo Jeff Daniels Paul Dano Garret Dillahunt Tracie Thoms Noah Segan David Jensen Director Rian Johnson Running time 158 Release Opened Sep 28 2012  Editorial Review Time travel with a thrilling twistBy Ann HornadayFriday September 28 2012On paper the science-fiction/action-adventure ""Looper"" possesses all of the elements that make the seasoned reviewer recoil if not in horror then at least sheer boredom time travel hit men grisly violence kids in jeopardy. Enough already right? But even these tired tropes can feel vibrant and new in the hands of an accomplished filmmaker. Rian Johnson ""Loopers"" writer-director revisits territory well tilled by such hands as Philip K. Dick and comes up with a movie thats far more ambitious than a mere genre exercise. As both an elaboration of the sci-fi form and an engaging philosophically provocative drama ""Looper"" turns out to be as substantive as it is stylish. Joseph Gordon-Levitt who also starred in Johnsons debut film ""Brick"" plays Joe a laconic young man living in Kansas City in 2042 where as the film opens he recites a French lesson in a wheat field while consulting his pocket watch. Another man suddenly appears and -- blam -- Joe blows him away. He explains in a voice-over that his victim has come from the 2070s when the mob uses time-traveling assassins like Joe -- called loopers -- to dispose of bodies that technically dont exist. Its a living and a pretty good one -- Joe stashes bricks of silver under the floorboards of his apartment -- until the mob boss of the future a ruthless racketeer called the Rainmaker -- decides to ""close the loop"" and sends the older version of the hit man back to be killed. Thats precisely what happens to Joe who when he confronts his older self -- played in the film by Bruce Willis -- doesnt quite carry out the orders as planned. But thats not for lack of trying. Among the many and mostly fascinating convolutions of ""Looper"" is how willing young Joe is to off old Joe who has come back to the past with his own agenda. An intricate chase ensues the two men grappling with issues of identity fate and contradictory motivations until confronting each other in an exceptionally taut well-staged scene in a rural diner. Much has been made of how Gordon-Levitt with the help of a prosthetic nose and makeup has become a younger version of Willis. The resemblance is indeed uncanny but owes as much to the younger actors mastery of Williss speech cadences and body language as anything else. Together they create the seamless illusion of one man who has led multiple lives an Im-still-me-but-not-that-me reality that anyone older than 20 surely can relate to. Johnson similarly has created an entirely believable futuristic America where the middle class has effectively disappeared creating a seedy viciously bifurcated society of have-nots and have-even-lesses. ""Looper"" doesnt traffic in shiny gizmo-laden visions of Generation Next; rather the loopers use big ungainly blunderbusses to shoot their victims. The citys ""vagrants"" live in tent cities that look dismally contemporary and Joe favors the leather jackets and skinny ties of his hard-boiled cousins from 20th-century pulp fiction. ""Do something new. Wear something glowing around your neck"" growls Abe Joes Fagin-like boss played to a grumpy tee by Jeff Daniels. ""Looper"" benefits from a passel of terrific supporting performances not just from Daniels (here nicely leveraging the grouchy persona hes been honing throughout the first season of ""The Newsroom"") but from Emily Blunt as a sunburned farmer and housekeeper named Sara and Pierce Gagnon who as her young son Cid delivers the films most astonishingly assured and unsettling performance. (Rarely has the simple phrase ""Hand me that Phillips"" landed with such commanding authority.) The disquieting lengths Johnson is willing to go to with kids in ""Looper"" proves his mettle as a filmmaker who wont compromise hard truths about moral agency for the sake of the audiences comfort. The ethics of saving the future by changing the past might be a time-worn theoretical question. But ""Looper"" brings it to life with startling inventiveness and visual pizazz whether in a grimly imaginative scene of the effects of a characters torture showing up on his future older body or some dazzlingly clever staging during a climactic sequence at Saras farmhouse. A glance at the characters names indicates a trend at work in ""Looper"" which may begin as a ""Terminator""-like piece of time travel escapism but ultimately gathers Old Testament-worthy force and fury. Its not just gravitas that makes ""Looper"" so enjoyable but Johnsons well-timed injections of taste and wit like music cues from Warren Zevon and Richard and Linda Thompson or when young Joe tells another character that hes planning on one day moving to France. ""Im from the future"" the older man says. ""You should go to China."" Thanks to the assured hold Johnson exerts over this ingeniously structured game of cat-and-cat well go anyplace he has in mind.Contains strong violence profanity some sexuality/nudity and drug content.

Photo Bruce WIllis as ""Joe"" in the action thriller Looper. ( ) Being a contract killer is difficult if often well paying under the best of circumstances. For Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the retro-futuristic gunman in Rian Johnsons whip-smart and twisty sci-fi thriller ""Looper it becomes especially mind-bending. Joes latest assigned victim is a 30-years-older -- but still tough-as-nails -- version of himself (Bruce Willis). The Older Joe has unwillingly turned up in Joes time (2044) for elimination courtesy of an especially ingenious variation on outsourcing that might be termed backsourcing. It seems that by 2077 forensics have made it virtually impossible to dispose of people without detection. So when time travel is invented -- and instantly banned because of its potential for mischief -- criminals start using the device to ship their victims back to the past. Younger Joe belongs to a gang of ""loopers in a dystopian Kansas City who rub out the unfortunates when they arrive in 2044 and dispose of the bodies. It gets even more complicated but in a way that the film (unlike many sci-fi flicks) lays out very clearly. The Rainmaker the never-seen crime boss in the future who devised this operation is also ""closing the loops by shipping back the retired loopers -- like Older Joe -- for the big sleep. Still with me? Younger Joe a drug addict with no attachments is fine with this at least in theory. Closing your loop gets you a very comfortable early retirement albeit one with a 30-year shelf life. But Younger Joe momentarily hesitates when Older Joe finally materializes at Joes regular killing spot in a cornfield letting his still-deadly middle-aged self escape. Worse Older Joes on a mission that makes both Joes the targets of all the other loopers. Because a woman he deeply loves will be killed by the Rainmakers agents when Older Joes captured in 30 years hes determined to rewrite that future history by shutting down the whole operation. Which Older Joe reckons wont even happen if back in 2047 Older Joe tracks down and eliminates the Rainmaker who at that point is just a child who will grow up into a monster in 2077. Older Joes search for the kid -- and Younger Joes simultaneous hunt for Older Joe so he can fulfill his contract -- converge at a remote farmhouse where a fierce young woman named Sara (an excellent Emily Blunt) is wielding a shotgun to protect a 10-year-old son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) with a fearsome temper. There are many more twists beyond that. The always wonderful Gordon-Levitt has been fitted with elaborate prosthetics and contact lenses to more closely resemble Willis -- somewhat distracting at first and not really necessary. In truth the two actors together manage to convince you through sheer acting that theyre the same person at different stages of life -- especially during a wonderful scene where they argue over steak and eggs in a diner. Willis has the smaller part but he once again proves that hes one of the most underrated actors of the past 30 years -- able to blend toughness tenderness and humor in ways that elude most of his peers. Perhaps Willis will finally get the Oscar nomination he deserved for ""The Sixth Sense. Theres also a notable contribution by Jeff Daniels whos been shipped back to 2044 by the Rainmaker to brutally oversee the looper squad. At one point he wryly notes that their taste in fashion is dictated by movies that were based on other movies. Director Johnson who made an auspicious debut seven years ago with the high-school noir ""Brick starring Gordon-Levitt helms his sharp clever script (which pays homage to ""The Terminator and the works of Philip K. Dick among others) with great assurance. While theres no shortage of impressive effects -- several characters have telekinetic powers -- Johnson wisely largely eschews them in the films dialogue-driven middle section as three main characters with varying and ever-changing motives debate the potential outcomes of their actions. An indie-inflected popcorn movie with major brains brilliant acting and a highly satisfying payoff ""Looper is the first must-see movie of the season.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT In the future a time-traveling hit man comes face to face with his younger self; rated R (violence nudity language) BOTTOM LINE A fast-moving brain-twisting thriller with uncanny performances from Gordon-Levitt and Willis in whats almost a single role. CAST Joseph Gordon-Levitt Bruce Willis Emily Blunt LENGTH 158 The future haunts the past in ""Looper"" a hugely entertaining brain-twisting thriller starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis as a time-traveling hit man who becomes his own target. Everything shifts and changes in this Rubiks Cube of a movie including Gordon-Levitt himself. Hes become one of Hollywoods most familiar faces thanks to his high-profile turn in ""The Dark Knight Rises"" but in ""Looper"" he undergoes an astonishing transformation that leaves him virtually unrecognizable. Gordon-Levitt plays Joe a young assassin employed by the soothsaying gangster Abe (Jeff Daniels). Its easy work Victims from the future suddenly appear before Joes waiting blunderbuss with payment conveniently strapped to their bodies. Eventually Joe will have to close his own loop but as he wryly notes ""This job doesnt tend to attract the most forward-thinking people.""

""Looper"" is the first wide release from writer-director Rian Johnson (""The Brothers Bloom"") an under-the-radar genius who cast Gordon-Levitt in the 2005 cult film ""Brick."" Returning the favor the actor plays Joe under elaborate but almost invisible makeup by Kazuhiro Tsuji which subtly reshapes his face toward Willis-ness. Its an imperfect effect but Gordon-Levitts canny performance helps particularly when the Joes face off at a diner (over identical plates of steak and eggs). The relatively low-budget ""Looper"" will draw inevitable comparisons to Christopher Nolans outsize ""Inception"" (also with Gordon-Levitt) but this is a funnier rougher (and much shorter) movie. Johnsons action scenes occasionally stumble but the devilishly clever script makes ""Looper"" a thrilling dizzying ride.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 28 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Sep. 27 2012 303PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Rian Johnson Written by Rian Johnson Starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Bruce Willis Jeff Daniels Emily Blunt Classification 14A Genre scifi Year 2012 Country USA Language English Back in his feature debut Brick writer-director Rian Johnson was content to bring deep shades of film noir to the hallways of high school. Well Looper ups the ante like a poker player on speed. What a potpourri of genres we have here - noir again but sci-fi too and action and horror and psycho-drama with existential trimmings the latter designed to invite the thinking viewer into the fray. Johnson flips the switch on the mixer and out pours an odd yet rich blend - too rich sometimes and not as nourishing as billed but wonderfully easy to swallow. Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Looper"" Movies Looper The official trailer Rian Johnson director of Looper on the red carpet at TIFF 2012 TIFF 2012 Video ""I hope time travel never exists"" Looper director Bruce Willis smiles during the press conference for his new movie ""Looper"" during the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto on Thursday Sept. 6 2012. THE CANADIAN PRESS video Video Bruce Willis explains why Looper is not your average sci-fi flick First frame Suddenly from nowhere a hooded figure appears shackled and on his knees in a vast cornfield. Behind him stands a paid assassin. The trigger is pulled the deadly deed is done. In the Kansas of 2044 there are several such assassins low-rent killers known as ""loopers."" Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is among them his job to bump off targets worm-holed back from the future 30 years hence. There time-travel has been invented but given its reality-warping dangers made illegal. Only the Mob uses it What better way to dispose of bodies than to gun them down in the past?These early scenes set a brisk pace sink a deep hook and keep the eye intrigued. Turns out that 2044 is just a grimy extension of the present with the poor vastly multiplied and further distanced from the rich. Nattily attired the retro-hipster of his era Joe runs with the affluent crowd using his silver bounty to own a sleek convertible placate his stripper girlfriend and support his considerable drug habit. His boss is Abe (Jeff Daniels in a Lincoln-esque beard) whisked back three decades to run the hit-squad and to flash his sharp wit. When our looper announces his plan for a sojourn in Paris honest Abe is quick to counter ""Im from the future - you should go to China.""Yes the dialogue is as clever as the conceit. So is the twist For every assassin there comes the moment when the transported figure in the hood is his future self and the killer must ""close the loop"" by killing himself - homicide bleeding into suicide. But when Young Joe points his blunderbuss at Old Joe (Bruce Willis) the wily veteran escapes and the chases are on. Abe is now in hot pursuit of callow Joe who is hard after grizzled Joe who is himself on the hunt for a demonic child fated to become the futures evil overlord. Confusing?Surprisingly not. What follows layers in all manner of plot-heavy complexities - Emily Blunt surfaces to double as a love interest and the childs anxious mother - but for the most part the convolutions are logically laid out. And when the film does stall under their weight Johnson is quick to re-ignite the momentum and re-engage our interest not least by elevating the action with his visual flair. En route the principals and supporters are uniformly strong. Daniels ratchets up the menace without losing the humour; Gordon-Levitt sports a latex proboscis and a louche gait to suggest his genetic debt to Willis; and Bruce himself is at the top of his squinty-eyed game.Admittedly the thinking viewer will be disappointed. The classic tensions are certainly there to ponder - father versus son experience versus innocence nature versus nurture the cycle of violence versus the dawn of peace. However this is where the mix of genres gets too rich and tends to dilute the themes with the result that the deep thoughts seem shallow - imagine if you dare The Playboy of the Western World in a wading pool with The Demon Seed. So in the end the fun in Looper definitely trumps the philosophy - then again in the end maybe fun is the greater good.

Sony Pictures Entertainment Joseph Gordon-Levitt in ""Looper."" Sony Pictures Entertainment photo Time-travel movies are a chronic temptation for imaginative filmmakers especially if part of the story takes place in a make-believe future. But they are also a challenge. How does a layman account for the ripple effect in quantum physics that has baffled scientists since Einstein? Even Homer Simpson knows that if you change something in the past it will annihilate the future.""Looper"" blows a hole through the nerdy need for answers inviting us to shut up and go for a joyride.Our guide is a guy name Joe. In 2042 in Kansas Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a hard-boiled hitman with a very specialized list of victims pests from the year 2072 who are sent backward three decades to the cornfield where Joe exterminates them. Its a dirty way to earn a suitcase of silver but it keeps him supplied with hookers and hallucinogenic eye drops. The catch is that when a hitmans future self outlives his usefulness he might be sent backward in time to be killed. Thats what happens to Joes sidekick Seth (Paul Dano) who lets his older doppelganger run loose angering local crime boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) and potentially tearing the fabric of the space-time continuum.But Seth learns from his older self that the world of the future is controlled by an evil overlord called the Rainmaker who must be stopped by any means necessary. And soon Joe gets the same message from a source whos hard to ignore his own alter-ego (played by Bruce Willis) who has arrived from the future to kill the Rainmaker as a boy. Although the premise resembles ""The Terminator"" James Cameron never gave us a guilty-pleasure scene like the one where Willis and Gordon-Levitt face off in a diner and debate the butterfly effect. Director Rian Johnson (""Brick"") maintains a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward time travel and neo-noir violence even while evoking a believably detailed dog-eat-dog future. And theres another alternative universe here the idyllic farm where young Joe hides from his gun-toting elder with single mom Sara (Emily Blunt). While ""Looper"" lacks the heft of a classic this wayback machine is worth taking for a spin.LOOPERThree stars out of four  Rating R  Run time 158  Content Violence strong language drug use and some sexuality Videos Looper trailer Sep 19 2012 (...)

The idea that the future will suck incalculably worse than the present did not begin with ""The Hunger Games"" of course. It goes back at least as far as the Cold War and the A-bomb. (Its not as if the dystopian vision was brand-new then either - Aldous Huxleys ""Brave New World"" was published in 1932.) Authors screenwriters and directors are always future-casting based on the most visible present-tense trends which is no doubt why the chaotic years from the late 60s through the early 80s produced so many memorable futuristic nightmares from ""Planet of the Apes"" to ""Soylent Green"" to ""Escape From New York.""If writer-director Rian Johnsons witty dark and highly ambitious time-travel thriller ""Looper"" clearly belongs somewhere in that tradition it isnt post-apocalyptic at least not in the normal sense. You might say that those of us in 2012 are right in the middle of its slow-moving apocalypse and have only partly noticed it. No one in the movie ever discusses how America has changed between now and 2044 the present of ""Looper"" but certain things are obvious Fossil fuels appear to be scarce to nonexistent; most of the cars we see are 2000s clunkers retrofitted with solar panels. Technology has continued to miniaturize and develop but class divisions have only gotten worse. The unnamed American metropolis (possibly Kansas City) where the main action takes place has an impressive skyline but its streets are a John Carpenter zone of wreckage and chaos where might makes right.As Joe the hit man protagonist played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt explains in voice-over time travel has not yet been invented in the 2040s. It will be about 30 years hence and will promptly be outlawed becoming a tool for gangsters and secret agents. Joe knows this because he works for Abe (a nifty little role for Jeff Daniels who does sinister nicely) a crime boss from the future. Joe has a pocket watch and dresses like a character from a crime movie made long before he was born -- ""Looper"" is full of those kinds of stylized choices -- and his usual task is to stand in cornfields waiting for undesirables of the future to be shipped back bound and masked so he can bump them off. Thats right He murders people who may not have been born yet and dumps bodies that dont officially exist - and the brain-twister is only getting started.Im not ready to proclaim ""Looper"" a sci-fi masterpiece just yet; lets let it sit awhile. But its a lean mean smart violent picture with a bit of Stanley Kubrick edge fueled by the terrific Gordon-Levitt who simultaneously plays a guy whose confident worldview is falling apart and does the most uncanny impression of Bruce Willis youve ever seen. (Id never even thought about Willis as an actor with distinctive mannerisms at least beyond that trademark thin-lipped smirk but I do now.) Thats important because as you may have heard Willis is also in the movie playing an older version of Joe one sent back from the 2070s to be executed by his younger self - this is known as ""closing the loop"" - who escapes for complicated reasons. (Or well yeesh - lets say for now that in some of the probable or possible outcomes thats what happens.) You Might Also Like I look forward to lengthy discussions about the brilliance and/or stupidity of the way Johnson handles the narrative logical philosophical and physical problems raised by time travel (precisely the factors that make most theoretical physicists conclude that traveling backward in the space-time continuum will never be possible). As Willis Joe says to Gordon-Levitts Joe when they meet face to face over steak and eggs in a very 20th-century diner theyll never get anywhere if they sit there all day ""talking time-travel shit."" But heres how it seems to work Our lives as we have experienced them up to now are only one possible eventuality. If someone goes back in time and drowns your grandma in the bathtub as a baby then the whole timeline that includes you will be replaced by another one.In other words you really could prevent the Holocaust by going back and murdering Hitler although a cascade of unforeseen consequences might flow from that. Without giving too much away the story of ""Looper"" offers a variation on that theme. After finding some redemption in the latter portion of a dissolute 21st-century existence and then facing a crippling tragedy the Willis version of Joe loops himself back to the world of his youth on a personal preemptive errand of vendetta. (Its all about a woman he met in Shanghai and a fearsome criminal godfather of the 2070s called the Rainmaker. Since you asked.) The Gordon-Levitt version of Joe first sees older Joe as a threat to his own survival - ""letting your loop run"" is a major infraction of the time-travel hit-man code - then as a potential ally and then ... well lets leave their final collision at an isolated farmhouse where a creepy telekinetic kid lives with his sexy single mom (Emily Blunt) for you to discover. It might be fair to describe ""Looper"" as an unstable combination of 70s-style grime and grit Kubricks ""The Shining"" Christopher Nolans ""Inception"" and the better creepier portions of any given M. Night Shyamalan picture. But hell Ill take that seven days a week over the predictable three-act formulas of almost all American genre movies these days. Johnsons screenplay may get stuck on some unresolvable plot conundrums - Ill have to see it again to feel sure - and may also offer a bit too much indie-flavored shaggy-dog-ness along with Bruce Willis wielding firearms.But this is a genuinely tough-minded and unpredictable movie one of the falls most enjoyable entertainments which comes darn close to fulfilling the potential Johnson displayed in his debut the hilarious and eccentric high-school noir ""Brick"" which also starred Gordon-Levitt. (I wasnt a huge fan of ""The Brothers Bloom"" which felt way too much like a Wes Anderson film without Anderson.) Underneath the futuristic setting and the sophomoric mind-benders ""Looper"" offers some flint-hard Zen lessons about the ways idealism and regret can become as destructive as cynicism and greed especially when were talking about the delusional male ego. Learning to live with what actually happened in the past however much we deliberately misremember it embellish it or lie about it is as close to maturity as most of us ever get. Imagine Johnson asks how badly we would screw things up if we could actually change it. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

(The older version of the character is played by Bruce Willis.)EnlargeCloseAlan Markfield TriStar PicturesJoseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the assassin Joe in Looper. (The older version of the character is played by Bruce Willis.)Sponsored LinksNot that thats a bad thing.When so much of what Hollywood churns out is almost instantly forgettable it says a lot about a film when viewers want to take time to argue ponder and puzzle over it.TRAILER LooperTRUITT A time-travelers guide to time travel at the moviesThis futuristic saga is directed with narrative complexity and visual panache by Rian Johnson who made 2005s Brick and 2008s The Brothers Bloom two wonderfully distinctive but under-appreciated indies.Looper (   1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday nationwide) stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Joe a specialized assassin well remunerated by a shadowy crime syndicate which sends people it wants killed back in time 30 years for waiting loopers to dispose of them without leaving a trace. The tale loops back and forth three decades between the future -- 2074 -- and the present -- 2044 when time travel has not yet been invented. Where it becomes most complicated is when the loop is closed -- or when a looper is confronted by the older version of himself and must execute him.Gordon-Levitts older counterpart is played by Bruce Willis. And because the two bear virtually no physical resemblance Gordon-Levitts subtly handsome face is altered via prosthetic makeup to look like a younger version of Willis. While sometimes the facial reconfiguring -- particularly the eyes and mouth changes -- can be distracting Gordon-Levitts performance deftly approximates Willis mannerisms expressions and vocal patterns.Looper essentially unfolds in two acts with the first part establishing a seedy dystopian universe and the mayhem within it and the second act taking place in a simpler environment that focuses on younger Joe (Gordon-Levitt) and Sara (Emily Blunt) a taciturn woman Joe meets as he skulks about her Kansas farmhouse. This segment also explores the connection Joe establishes with Saras 5-year-old son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) who could grow up to be a key player in the world of loopers.In the latter section the audience becomes more emotionally invested as multidimensional characters reveal their complex motivations. Some scenes in this precisely constructed saga have elements of Blade Runner Terminator The Bad Seed and The Omen though mostly this is a humanistic drama a deeply ethical tale about the lengths to which people will go to save those they love.Between Looper and Safety Not Guaranteed -- a lower-budget but equally engaging film -- 2012 has been an auspicious year for clever time-travel thrillers. Nevermind the Mayan calendar implications -- its a welcome trend. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Also starring Emily Blunt and Jeff Daniels. (Video Sony) By Joe Morgenstern Sept. 27 2012 601 p.m. ET Heres a new definition of self-confidence. You make a movie that seems to be about time travel. Not just seems to be but in a strong sense is since people drop in periodically from the future only to be blown away by a drug-addled assassin called a looper. Then you poke fun at the logic of your own premise with several scenes suggesting that the time travel stuff shouldnt be taken too seriously. So whats left for the audience to hook into? Only pounding action elegant style steady-state suspense marvelous acting and despite that droll pooh-poohing every now and then haunting explorations of youth age and personal destiny. Its a lot to claim for a sci-fi thriller but I was blown away by Rian Johnsons ""Looper."" ENLARGE Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in Looper. Sony Pictures The assassin in question Joe is played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The actor doesnt quite look like himself thanks to prosthetic adjustments of his familiar features though the explanation for that is soon apparent. And the character confronting himself in a mirror checks to see if his hairline is receding; its a nice little joke with the same explanation in the intricate story which is set mainly in 2044. Joe works within a looping system of remorseless killers that extends another 30 years into the future. By then time travel has been invented and mobsters send their enemies back to 2044 so that loopers can do the dirty work of killing them and disposing of the bodies. (If that sounds impenetrably intricate or simply arbitrary the movies stylistic authority makes it lucid and reasonably logical.) To Joes dismay however the mob sends his future self back for him to kill--its called closing the loop--and lo and behold the older Joe is played by Bruce Willis. This explains the prosthetic adjustments--they help Mr. Gordon-Levitt resemble the older man he will become--as well as the sight gag about hair of which Mr. Willis has next to none. More to the point of the plot this precipitates a dizzying succession of chases trackdowns and confrontations after Joes failure to bump off his future self leaves one too many iterations of the same individual in the same time frame. The films visual energy is unflagging. A neon arrow points to danger. A dancers platform shoes pop out in vivid turquoise. A forlorn diner stands in the middle of nowhere as if in an Edward Hopper painting. (Steve Yedlin was the cinematographer and Ed Verreaux designed the production.) A cane field plus a little robot crop duster playfully echo the corn field sequence in ""North by Northwest"" while serving the action in similar ways. Any one of the movies set pieces would do a filmmaker proud. Together they struck me as a live-action counterpart of ""The Incredibles"" the Pixar epic that showed there was nothing computer animation couldnt do. This is only Mr. Johnsons third film following his remarkable debut feature ""Brick"" (film noir in a California high school with Mr. Gordon-Levitt as a teenage detective) and ""The Brothers Bloom"" (con men played not so remarkably for laughs). Yet there seems to be nothing he cant do at this point in his career. Hes as good at directing actors as he is at staging action and not only his two stars who play intriguingly different versions of their character at different stages of his life. (Mr. Willis has a wider emotional range to work with since the older Joe whos on a mission of impassioned purpose has known love and shattering loss.) Jeff Daniels is scarily volatile in the minor role of Abe a major mobster. Emily Blunt gives a stunning performance as a farm woman Sara who tends that cane field while shes struggling to raise her explosive young son Cid. (Explosive is an understatement for this kid and astonishing is a fair description of Pierce Gagnon the little boy who plays him.) Sara is a crucial figure in Joes spiritual development--much of the story turns on a mothers love--and their times together are charged with tension and longing. Its easy to be beguiled by the productions dazzling surfaces; theyre so dazzling that the plots improbabilities and downright impossibilities are readily forgiven if not forgotten. But theres no forgetting the beauty and mystery that flow from the premise in general and in particular from scenes that bring the two Joes face to face. Clever contrivances they may be but these confrontations raise classic questions about living in the moment versus looking to the future about learning from experience and being able--or not--to change ones fate. On that last count the news is good. The future this film tells us cant be predicted because it isnt fixed. All the same its safe to predict that ""Looper"" will transform Mr. Johnsons career and give pleasure to popeyed audiences for a long time to come. ENLARGE Players in The Other Dream Team. Getty Images The Other Dream Team Reaching back is one of the more vivid cliches of the sports world a phrase that denotes focused striving. In ""The Other Dream Team"" athletes prevail joyously by reaching back to memories forged during decades of poverty suffering and national humiliation. Marius Markeviciuss inspiring documentary tells the story of Lithuanian basketball stars--most prominently Sarunas Marciulionis and Arvydas Savonis--who were forced to play for the Soviet Union during that nations occupation of their homeland They led the U.S.S.R. to victory over the U.S. and a gold medal at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. Four years later after the fall of the Soviet Union the Lithuanians went to the Olympics in Barcelona as members of their newly independent nations team. They lost to the U.S. powerhouse--no surprise there--but in a piece of stunning symbolism humbled the Russians. (The title plays off the then-ubiquitous term for the U.S. team whose capturing of the gold didnt faze the Lithuanian players. ""The bronze medal"" one of them says ""was for us like gold."") The productions focus is split--properly and effectively--between basketball and realpolitik. Archival footage documents the plight of the Baltic states caught between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany then Lithuanias subjugation behind the Iron Curtain. Its a chillingly instructive counterpoint to the Diaspora of that tiny nations athletes followed by their triumphant resurgence. In a wonderfully surreal--yet entirely real--sequence of events the formation of the national team is aided and abetted by the Grateful Dead. Still the essence of the film lies in the athletes towering charm and the nature of their journey. Mr. Marciulionis recalls his first visit to California where in a Safeway market he wept upon discovering that the fruits and vegetables werent rationed. Watch a clip from the documentary film ""The Eye Has to Travel"" a look at the life and work of the influential fashion editor of Harpers Bazaar Diana Vreeland. (Video Samuel Goldwyn Films/EPIX) ENLARGE Diana Vreeland in Diana Vreeland The Eye Has to Travel. Below Estate of Horst P. Horst - Art + Commerce Diana Vreeland The Eye Has to Travel Its an excellent week for documentaries. Lisa Immordino Vreelands celebration of her husbands legendary grandmother makes a compelling case for the late Diana Vreeland as the 20th centurys pre-eminent tastemaker not to mention one of its most extravagant personalities. After a quarter-century as the fashion editor of Harpers Bazaar Vreeland took over a sleepy magazine as someone describes it called Vogue. She wasted no time waking it up and shaking it up into a powerhouse processing the zeitgeist of the Swinging Sixties into text-and-photo fantasies that dictated fashion. (The model Veruschka tall as a basketball player recalls going to Japan for a Vreeland-inspired spread that paired her with an even taller sumo wrestler.) Vreeland is seen in conversations with George Plimpton who put together her oral history and with a string of other celebrity interviewers who are understandably awed by her vibrant presence. Vibrating to frequencies no longer in vogue shes throatily full of herself but also blessed with self-honesty. (""Its too bad you have such a beautiful sister and youre so ugly"" she remembers her mother telling her.) If theres anything more surprising than the list of famous people she put on the map or at least on her magazines cover--Twiggy Bacall Streisand Cher--its how hard she worked at her calling. She has only two things to say in the film about World War II Hitlers mustache was ridiculous (""It was so wrong"") and the bikini came out of the war like an atom bomb. But her mots about fashion and the high life are truly bon (""The first thing my love is to arrange to be born in Paris; everything else follows quite naturally."") Like no one before or since she had what she valued most in others--good old-fashioned pizazz. ENLARGE DVD Focus Twelve Monkeys (1995) Bruce Willis suffers horribly and heroically in Terry Gilliams sci-fi fantasy about a time traveler who tries to change the course of a pandemic that has banished mankind from the surface of the earth to its steaming bowels. This is vintage Gilliam meaning its dark pessimistic intricate at best and chaotic at worst. Yet the film which was written by David Peoples and Janet Peoples has many virtues and cumulative power. The cast includes Brad Pitt doing a sensational turn as a deranged animal-rights activist and Madeleine Stowe as an open-minded psychiatrist. Hoop Dreams (1994) Its neither the first time nor the last for me to recommend this magnificent documentary directed by Steve James and written by him and Frederick Marx. The film takes 170 minutes to run its course. The time does run by though as in superlative drama. The locale is Chicago where two young basketball prodigies from the projects William Gates and Arthur Agee dream against heavy odds of superstardom in the NBA. ""Hoop Dreams"" illustrates the reasons for those odds; in addition to being a top-notch sports film its a sobering study of race class and life in the inner city. Funny Face (1957) Diana Vreeland inspired the imperious fashion editor in this classic MGM musical. After invoking ""the great American woman who stands out there naked waiting for me to tell her what to wear"" Kay Thompsons Maggie Prescott urges her underlings to ""think pink."" Fred Astaire is a fashion photographer inspired by Richard Avedon. Audrey Hepburn is a bookstore-clerk-turned-fashion model an enchanting creature who wears Givenchy costumes and sings timeless Gershwin songs against timeless Parisian backdrops. Stanley Donen directed with pizazz from a script by Leonard Gershe that struggles not always successfully with the age disparity between the two stars.

By Mekado Murphy on Publish Date September 26 2012. . Watch in Times Video >> embed ""Looper"" an obstreperously entertaining bullet- and attitude-ridden science-fiction pastiche opens in a futuristic world that looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. Set in 2044 in a dystopia with Turner Classic Movies flavor it puts a spin on the familiar figure of the existentially troubled gun for hire while leaving a layer of dust on many of the other genre fundamentals it plays with. Some of it youve seen and heard before intentionally so though it adds a weird wrinkle an attempt to transform Joseph Gordon-Levitt his nose prosthetically bobbed and a smirk surfing his thinned upper lip into the wisecracking Bruce Willis of the ""Moonlighting"" years. Photo Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a young contract killer who confronts his older self in ""Looper."" Credit Alan Markfield/TriStar Pictures The ostensible reason for Mr. Gordon-Levitts extreme makeover is that he and Mr. Willis are playing the same contract killer Joe at different ages. A looper the young Joe works for an outfit that exists 30 years beyond 2044 where time travel exists but is illegal. Whenever the outfit wants to dispose of a ""problem"" it sends the problem with a hood over his head into the past where a looper is waiting with a gun to blow him to smithereens. The hook -- you can almost hear the original movie pitch its so tidy -- is that every so often the outfit sends back an older looper whos unknowingly killed by his younger self which is how the 2044 Joe stares down his middle-aged counterpart.It isnt a happy meeting but the writer and director Rian Johnson makes it a largely diverting one filled with wit smashing edits and showy at times distracting allusions that reflect his cleverness like little mirrors. Slamming genre cheap thrills together with high-art aspirations Mr. Johnson spins a fast-moving entertainment out of a setup that could have been cooked up by the science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick and was undoubtedly influenced by Chris Markers cinematic touchstone from 1962 ""La Jetee"" in which scientists in a postapocalyptic world send as the film puts it ""emissaries into time to call past and future to the rescue of the present."" The middle-aged Joe sets off on a similar mission trying to persuade his younger self to go along. Photo Bruce Willis in ""Looper."" Credit Alan Markfield/TriStar Pictures Its a juicy premise ripe for the squeezing though it takes a while to get over Joes looking less like a young Mr. Willis and more like Keanu Reeves with a dash of Marlon Brando doing Japanese minstrel for ""The Teahouse of the August Moon."" Mr. Johnson throws a lot at the screen blasted corpses included yet little here is as initially transfixing as Mr. Gordon-Levitts mug. The makeover is a distracting miscalculation and a curious one given that for his last movie ""The Brothers Bloom"" Mr. Johnson cast the non look-alikes Adrien Brody and Mark Ruffalo in the title roles. Even so after the bodies and plot twists pile up and after youve scoped out the Bruce-ified downward curve of Mr. Gordon-Levitts nose and laughed when he worriedly touches his receding hairline the movie starts getting its groove on.Theres a lot to get past including an antediluvian divide between hard-charging men and decorative dames including a stripper Suzie (Piper Perabo) who works at a club called La Belle Aurore the name of the Paris joint where Humphrey Bogart once met Ingrid Bergman. As time goes by indeed or as Mr. Johnson prefers loops the loop. (Using some metaphysical shorthand he also alludes to the cosmic cup of coffee brewed by Jean-Luc Godard in ""Two or Three Things I Know About Her."") Things or rather the gender politics improve once Joe fleeing the outfit -- with his older self nearby -- takes refuge at a farmhouse belonging to Sara (an appealing Emily Blunt) a single mom with a strange little boy Cid (an excellent Pierce Gagnon). There Mr. Johnson settles into something deeper swaps the banter for real feelings and wins you over.""Looper"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Lots of gun deaths. Looper Director Rian Johnson Writer Rian Johnson Stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt Bruce Willis Emily Blunt Paul Dano Jeff Daniels Rating R Running Time 1h 59m Genres Action Crime Drama Sci-Fi Thriller Movie data powered by IMDb.com Last updated Mar 30 2016 Correction October 2 2012 A film review on Friday about ""Looper"" misstated the year in which the movie is set. It is 2044 not 2074. Thus the young Joe works for an outfit that exists 30 years beyond 2044 not beyond 2074 and it is the 2044 Joe not the 2074 Joe who stares down his middle-aged counterpart.

Even with its echoes of sci-fi thrillers past from La Jette to The Terminator Rian Johnsons mind bender feels fresh -- fresh enough to be forgiven for sputtering off the rails in the final act.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Joe a hit man plying his trade in the middle of the current century. But hes no garden-variety assassin. He takes out the garbage from the future sent by crime bosses through a time portal to meet their maker. Theres something comically lazy about the bloodless ease of Joes work His targets arrive pre-bound on a plastic tarp at a specific time and place. All the Loopers do is pull the trigger and dispose of the corpses.Then one sunny day Joe looks his new prey in the eye and finds his future self (in the person of Bruce Willis) staring back. Hey you might flinch too. His loop left open the big crime boss (a bearlike Jeff Daniels) breathing down his neck Joe goes on the lam his target -- himself -- in pursuit.Johnson brought a unique neo-noir patter to his first feature the 2005 high school murder mystery Brick (also starring Gordon-Levitt) and he creates a similarly vivid universe in Looper. Everyone in the movie has a code to live by (Omar from The Wire would approve) an outlook and way of living and talking cobbled and skewed from old movie conventions. The movie shows how a wise hand can make something brand new from the shards of the past.After a classic diner confrontation with his middle-age self Joe holes up in a farmhouse with a tough mom (Emily Blunt) and her troubled young son (Pierce Gagnon). This is where Looper started to lose me. The kid it seems has some special powers that Willis Joe has reason to fear. The younger version wants to protect mother and son. In the movies parlance Looper soon has too many loops to close. It doesnt help that the supernatural kid thing has been done to death.Its a sign of Johnsons conviction and vision that his movie never sinks even as it takes on excess baggage. In the tradition of the best sci-fi Looper creates a world that feels much like our own but strange enough to fire the imagination.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.LOOPERB+ Directed by Rian Johnson.

"Movie review Looper is a film that wants to mess with your head - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Looper messes with your head Share Tweet Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 09.29.12 | 115 AM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Dear God what have they done to Joseph Gordon-Levitts face? In Rian Johnsons time-travel action drama ""Looper"" the star has been prosthetically altered with a fresh set of eyebrows a snubbed nose green contact lenses and what appear to be new lips. Hes supposed to look like the young Bruce Willis. What he resembles mostly is mid-period Devo. The imposture is hardly convincing but ""Looper"" is fast enough weird enough and just about smart enough to make you forget about that. The movie wants to mess with your head depositing us in a decrepit overcrowded 2044 and then sprinkling on time-loop variations like jimmies. Gordon-Levitt plays Joe a coolly feral young hit man who works for a crime syndicate that exists 30 years in his future a period when time travel has been both invented and outlawed. These unseen gangsters put a sack over their victims heads and send them back three decades where Joe or one of his colleagues is waiting with a shotgun. There are plenty of better ways to dispose of a body and if you give it a seconds thought youll come up with them. Still thats the setup and ""Looper"" pedals furiously and largely successfully to keep our disbelief from crashing to the ground. Joe has had a sweet life with the syndicate -- its point man in 2044 is a weary Jeff Daniels playing a character who has literally seen it all before -- and the heros fine with the fact that he has an expiration date. When the future gangsters are done with one of their assassins they send him back in time as a ""looper"" to be killed by his younger self who then gets a hefty payment in gold bars and a long time to spend it well and unwisely. The movies plot kicks into overdrive when a hit comes down the time tunnel to Joe and it turns out to be him. Or him plus 30 years. Old Joe (Willis). Confused yet? If not you will be when the film immediately rewinds and shows us the events as Old Joe sees them -- memories of the intervening years an unexpected lover (Summer Qing) and then the sudden rush to stay alive in his own past. It seems theres someone whos an adult in the future who needs killing as a child here and now. In a way ""Looper"" is ""The Terminator"" seen from the cyborgs point of view but it doesnt get too hung up on the metaphysics. ""I dont want to talk about time travel"" Old Joe snarls in one scene. ""Well be here all day making diagrams with straws."" Johnson is a prodigious talent who keeps coming close to a breakthrough. His first feature was the 2005 high school noir ""Brick"" -- Gordon-Levitt as Bogart in blue jeans. His second ""The Brothers Bloom"" (2008) was a con-man romantic comedy so self-consciously clever you wanted to smack it. ""Looper"" is his bid for the big time a conceptually audacious brain-twister with smarts style ""Matrix""-wannabe cool and action sequences that click into place like a Rubiks Cube. Its something to see yet slightly less than the sum of its parts. Johnson has a great movie in him and he keeps getting closer but hes not there yet. The two stars are fun to watch and you can tell theyre energized by the challenge of playing the same character at different points on the grid. Gordon-Levitt effectively muzzles his affability and becomes a colder harder figure -- an action hero stamped out of industrial-strength plastic. Williss performance isnt a match for the pug nobility of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Twelve Monkeys"" (another time warp tango) and you can see his limitations as an actor when Old Joe is called on to express emotional agony. That said all this films multilevel daring comes to a head when the two Joes face off over a diner table; its the mirror scene from ""Duck Soup"" for an age of personality crisis. Traces of the directors love for old detective movies linger. As a quavering loser of a fellow hit man Paul Dano summons the ghost of Peter Lorre while Noah Segan as a dumb but pretty enforcer is straight out of the Elisha Cook Jr. playbook. But at least Johnson is going for something fresh. Hell throw out an image like the letters that appear scarred into Old Joes arm and hell force you to do the math -- that this is the young Joes way of getting a message to his older doppelganger. ""Looper"" crackles with the wit of a talented filmmaker trying to out-think himself. You wonder how long Johnson can keep up the pace and truth be told he doesnt. After a first half so hectic and confident you can feel your synapses being redirected into new pathways the movie settles down into a dystopian spaghetti western. Young Joe comes to ground at a farm outside the city knowing that his quarry/nemesis/self will arrive in due time. The farm is owned by a trigger-happy but soulful single mom named Sara (Emily Blunt nicely distressed) and her young son Cid (Pierce Gagnon). The kid has an old face Whatever environmental or industrial cataclysm has created this ruined world we see the damage most clearly in Cids eyes. Something like a love story ensues and while ""Looper"" briefly ponders whether young Joes new feelings for Sara will erase Old Joes memories of his wife the butterfly-effect games largely slow to a halt. From a series of baroque curlicues the movie straightens into a line and the heady inventiveness of the early scenes dissipates. The final twist is both logical -- inasmuch as anything in this movie is logical -- and disappointingly abrupt as though another shoe were hanging up there refusing to drop. With ""Looper"" Johnson proves he can finesse the most complicated notions and visual setups his mind can imagine. Its the simple things that still elude him.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 301pm on Thursday Oct. 04 2012 Thursday Oct. 04 2012 Thursday Sep. 27 2012 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram In 2009 it looked as if we might be on the cusp of a golden age of science fiction in TV and film. Battlestar Galactica was wrapping up its award-winning five-year run and the big-screen Star Trek reboot proved to be a surprisingly enjoyable return to form.Two other movies Moon and District 9 reminded viewers that science fiction can be about heart and humanity not just hardware.That new dawn proved elusive though as there hasnt been much lately for those who crave some brain power along with their effects-driven firepower. Now comes Looper the time-travel tease from indie director/writer Rian Johnson ( Brick The Brothers Bloom) that is an immensely fun yet thought-provoking ride.The ubiquitous Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Joe a hit man living 30 years in the future whose job it is to execute other criminals sent through a time machine from his future. He erases their past and what would have been their future ceases to exist. Case closed.But then he comes face to face with his older self (Bruce Willis) who is sent back to be disposed of. This is where Looper is most intriguing -- Willis and Gordon-Levitt engage in a tense standoff in which they talk about what was what will be and what may never be.Where Looper begins to teeter off the track is when it sacrifices this one-on-one intensity for special effects a potential love interest (Emily Blunt) and a plot involving telekinesis. (Though to be fair their inclusion means we get one really cool death scene.)And as with most time-travel sagas you cant think about the details of how this world works too much -- or about Gordon-Levitts Willis-mimicking makeover -- without giving yourself a migraine.Still theres enough here to make you think maybe that promised golden age hasnt been derailed just delayed.

A recent case in point on the latter summers ""Total Recall."" ""Looper"" on the other hand aspires to achieve what dystopian kin like ""Minority Report"" accomplished create a fully realized but familiar world filled with intriguing characters who grapple with a slew of moral dilemmas.The shrewd ""Looper"" strikes a perfect balance with solid special effects that complement not suffocate its intense well-written story. As screenwriter and director Johnson -- who gave us the excitingly unique ""Brick"" -- imagines a bleak future. Yet he doesnt create a cynical tomorrow Indeed there are glimmers of hope.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is right on target once more as Joe a hit man from 2044 whose final assignment is to kill the man hed be 30 years in the future played by Bruce Willis -- who gives one of his meatiest performances. The movies title comes from the job title of the cocky young Joe -- a ""looper"" is the equivalent of a fast-food assassin hired by mobsters from the future. Although time travel has been outlawed the mob has illicit control of it and is sending targets back so their loopers can kill them.Advertisement Being a looper has its financial advantages in a society where the population of have-nots is exploding. Johnson conveys this yet doesnt go overboard using deft brush strokes -- such as the gritty exterior shots where Joe hangs out -- to detail his canvas. Once a looper fulfills his final mission of killing his older self he retires with a fat-cat payout.Joe leads a selfish unexamined life engaging in disposable sex with a stripper (Piper Perabo) and zonking out on drugs he squirts into his eyes. He even narcs on a friend (Paul Dano) who fails to ""close his loop"" -- slaying the older version of himself so mob fingerprints on time travel vanish. Joes 2044 supervisor of sorts is the casual and chatty though unquestioningly dangerous mob boss Abe (Jeff Daniels having a delicious time).All this future-world building might come across as dense and confusing when shoehorned into the proverbial nutshell but Johnson makes it a graceful dance. Youll need to stay focused though and most likely will want to see it again -- not just to tease the pieces together but because its that good.Johnson kicks the story into high gear when Joes older self pops up on the target block. Older Joe (Willis) manages to flee and the two later confront each other in a diner -- one of the films most memorable sequences with Gordon-Levitt and Willis having great fun with it.Later younger Joe holes up at a farmhouse owned by Sara (Emily Blunt as stunning and alluring as ever) a single mom whose little boy (a staggeringly good Pierce Gagnon) is prone to major tantrums.All of the characters have more going on than what first meets the eye and only a talented cast can pull off what Johnsons sharp script requires of them. Gordon-Levitt has the most difficult task assuming traits of Willis without copycatting. The ""Dark Knight Rises"" star never overdoes it shading in small mannerisms rather than coloring in every little detail. Its quite a feat and the makeup and prosthetics seem as natural as his uncanny Willis-tinged voice. Willis gives one of his best performances since ""Pulp Fiction."" Bruce Willis often plays Bruce Willis but here hes really required to act; in one scene in particular hes such a standout that hes worthy of Oscar consideration for a supporting role. The real star though remains Johnson. As both director and writer he makes all the right moves keeping aces tucked up his sleeve then revealing them to stunning effect.""Looper"" is a superior genre film an engrossing thriller that engages not only the senses but our minds as well just as good sci-fi should do.""Looper""    Rating R (for strong violence language some sexuality/nudity and drug use)Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt Bruce Willis Emily Blunt Pierce Gagnon Paul Dano Jeff DanielsDirector Rian JohnsonRunning time 1 hour 58 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Curb Your Enthusiasm The long wait for new episodes is almost overGame of Thrones Season 8 definitely the lastReview Holocaust haunts family in The Gathering Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

While the story presses forward were stuck wondering for instance how a character can safely hang out with his future self in the same time period -- an anomaly that despite Spocks shenanigans in the 2009 Star Trek reboot aficionados of Doctor Who know is a Very Bad Thing. Looper a cocky sci-fi tale with more brass than substance is rife with these ""Say what?"" moments. And though writer-director Rian Johnson smartly tries to eclipse the technical with the personal that strategy only works if you have a lead who earns our sympathy. It takes time -- and Joseph Gordon-Levitt turning into Bruce Willis -- for that to happen but its all the encouragement we need to forgive the films irrationalities and enjoy its offbeat performances and stylized nihilism. Narrating his own story Joe (Gordon-Levitt) informs us that its 2044 and time travel is 30 years away. It will however be criminalized so of course only criminals will have access to it. In the unimaginative way of big-screen bad guys they use it mostly to give their victims a one-way ticket to the past where a ""looper"" like Joe is lurking ready to kill them. Why the mob of the future cant just fit its marks with the time-tested cement footwear is unclear. Weirdly loopers approaching pensionable age are also dispatched to the past for termination often by their younger incarnations. (See ""Say what?"" moments above.) Should a young assassin balk at popping his elderly self a controller (a shaggy Jeff Daniels) is waiting to punish him usually with a hammer and a deeply pained expression. Well-behaved young loopers on the other hand enjoy a privileged life of drugs and dames and Joe is studying French and stashing silver bars under his floorboards in hopes of escaping to a less stressful retirement. i An assassin working in the films chaotic 2044 futurescape Joe is confronted with the task of killing his older self. Alan Markfield/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Alan Markfield/Sony Pictures An assassin working in the films chaotic 2044 futurescape Joe is confronted with the task of killing his older self. Alan Markfield/Sony Pictures Then predictably he discovers that his next victim is Future Joe (Bruce Willis) a wily type who tries to persuade Present Joe to help him terminate a kid who will grow up to become the crime-world equivalent of the Antichrist. What follows is an extended cat-and-mouse caper as the Joes hide from each other -- and in the case of Present Joe from the boss and his hammer -- until everyone convenes at an isolated farmhouse. There Emily Blunt awaits with a shotgun a simmering libido and a son who goes all Damien from The Omen whenever he gets irritated. Which is a lot. Set mainly in a grimy urban landscape cribbed from Children of Men and its like Looper is a self-consciously good-looking profoundly silly movie that nevertheless comes off as high-minded. Thats quite a trick and its helped by Gordon-Levitts transformation from the geeky charmer of his earlier films to morally confused dead-eyed hard case. At times he has an odd effects-enhanced look that resembles an avatar in a video game but at no time does he look like he could grow up to become Bruce Willis. And thats a pity -- because as we all know there are much worse fates.

Slideshow Blend of sci-fi suspense everyday 2044 Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Looper >> Set in a (yes) dystopian 2044 when urban cores are acrawl with aggressive panhandlers and cars and motorbikes pretty much look like they do now only more banged up Looper is about Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a twentysomething guy in Kansas City who makes his living a lucrative one killing people. The target materializes in a field sent from the future hog-tied a sack over his head. Joe stations himself in a clearing at the appointed hour readies his blunderbuss and then - bang - blows the victim away and takes the silver bars his payment strapped to the dead mans back. Time travel is illegal in 2044 and like a lot of illegal things its a big-money operation run by the mob. Between jobs Joe busies himself learning French (hes thinking of a move to Paris) and visiting a dance club where a girl named Suzie (Piper Perabo) offers her services for him naked. The life of a looper isnt all that glamorous though and it has its serious downside. Theres a clause in the contract that says you may at some point be required to kill your future self - this is called ""closing your loop."" And this is what happens one day to Joe except that when Old Joe shows up among the crops things go amiss. Young Joe doesnt kill Old Joe and Old Joe is off and running - 30 years in his own past. And Old Joe is played by Bruce Willis who knows a thing or two about time travel and dystopian futures (or pasts) and running for your life. See 12 Monkeys. Johnson the talented writer/director (who teamed with Gordon-Levitt in the far-more-modest high school noir Brick) has clearly seen 12 Monkeys too. Not to mention The Matrix and Inception. The paradoxes and ripple effects of crisscrossing the space-time continuum are daunting and its good to have a few reference points. Late in Looper when a highly telekinetic kid starts levitating things it really does look like Christopher Nolan had wandered onto the set and taken over. Speaking of telekinesis this is an ability that quite a few folks have developed in the mid-21st century. Its a mutation but mostly its used to float coins and impress the girls. But then there is Sara (a very good Emily Blunt) who lives out on a farm where she is mother to a strange child named Cid (Pierce Gagnon) warding off wandering hobos with a shotgun and mauling a tree stump with an ax. Sara and Cid figure prominently in Loopers second half as do Cids ""TK"" powers though the less said about who they are and how they fit into Johnsons tricky trippy plot the better. (And Im not sure I can explain it anyway) Gordon-Levitt wears prosthetics that change the slope of his nose the curl of his lips the cut of his brow to make the younger actor and Willis seem like perhaps they could be the same person separated by decades. When the two Joes meet in a diner to discuss their fate - or fates - Willis throws his cross-eyed glare at Gordon-Levitt who deflects the gaze with his own piercing stare. They also have steak and eggs. Looper grounds itself in the commonplace realities of moments like this and then takes off on wild flights of science fiction-y suspense. The combination is cool.

September 27 2012 -- 152pm Video (4231)  Star Tribune movie critic Colin Covert has nothing but good things to say about ""Looper"" a time-travel thrill ride that takes you to unexpected places. Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint COLIN COVERT colincovert ""Looper"" proves that what goes around comes around. In this brainy brutal science-fiction noir time travel exists -- even though only in the hands of future criminals. The gangsters of the 2070s use the outlawed technology as a waste management system. Since its impossible to beat their eras advanced forensics they send their enemies back 30 years to the sunny Kansas cornfields where ""loopers"" whack them and burn the bodies. Just so there are no loose ends its understood that one day the looper may have to off his future self. Those who dont ""close the loop"" are punished in a manner so creatively horrible that failure is not an option. Meanwhile its drugs decadence and depravity in grungy dystopian Kansas City. Rian Johnsons film delves into the ethical practical and emotional dilemmas this arrangement poses for its protagonist a callous hit man named Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt dapper and heartless). The sociopath gets a tough lesson in karma when he finds his gun pointing at the future version of himself (Bruce Willis). When Joe fumbles the rub-out -- wouldnt you? -- the film becomes a dark manhunt thriller with a steadily tightening grip. Old Joe knows something about the future and its tyrannical mob overlord ""the Rainmaker"" that makes him desperate to knock history off its tracks. Old Joe tries to reason with his young double but neither sees much in the other that he likes. Young Joes pursuit of the fugitive brings him to the farm of shotgun-toting mom Sara (Emily Blunt) and her troubled son (riveting Pierce Gagnon) who offer him a last chance at redemption. It arrives in a form that is painful but appropriate. ""Looper"" gives us a glimpse of a world where some things have changed but much is a warped extension of today. Future Kansas is a ghastly economic dead zone while Shanghai where several key scenes take place is a cutting-edge Shangri-La. Jeff Daniels plays a smiling-barracuda mafia emissary from the 2070s who warns his young hit men ""Learn Mandarin."" Sony Pictures Entertainment Associated Press - Ap Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in the action thriller ""Looper."" Nothing in Johnsons past prepared me for the impact of this film. His hardboiled 2005 high school murder mystery ""Brick"" was a clever stunt while his con-man romance ""The Brothers Bloom"" was a cloying exercise in arthouse whimsy. Here the writer/director isnt showing off but knuckling down. The plot is Swiss clockwork yet Johnson takes time to develop powerful characters. Hes visually in command of his material giving us scenes that resemble Andrew Wyeth landscapes others that echo mobster anime and a handful like nothing youve seen before. The film borrows expertly from ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Terminator"" sidestepping the logical paradoxes that can gum up even the best time-travel story. Old Joe tells his young self not to start asking questions or ""well just end up making diagrams with napkins and straws."" Its possible to nitpick ""Loopers"" story line but the setup is so confident that you willingly suspend disbelief. Johnson wears his new maturity with confidence delivering a tense twisty story with an unexpected emotional wallop.

Mores the pity because the strong first act promises a smart and stylish movie about the vagaries of time travel. While the stylish never goes away the smart does making this the second Rian Johnson movie in a row (following ""The Brothers Bloom"" the writer-directors sophomore effort after his Sundance hit debut ""Brick"") that looks great but meanders while doing it. In a requisite grimy-city-of-the-future Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a ""looper"" which is a very specific kind of hit man. Decades beyond Joes era time travel will be discovered and immediately banned. The only ones using it are mobsters who dispose of their targets by sending them 30 years into the past so that Joe and other loopers can exterminate the unlucky saps and destroy the bodies. When a looper ""closes the loop"" it means he kills his future self collects a big payday and counts down the three decades until his own demise. Working for mobster Abe (Jeff Daniels amusingly playing against type) Joe squirrels away his money and dreams of running off to France even though Abe tells him the action is in China. In a clever shout-out Abe operates out of a nightclub called La Belle Aurore named for the Paris bar where Rick and Ilsa hung out in ""Casablanca"" before the Nazis marched into town. Naturally Joe is eventually called upon to close the loop but his older self (Bruce Willis) isnt going down without a fight. Future Joe met the woman of his dreams in Shanghai and watched her die before getting sent back in time so he hopes to fix the future by changing the past. All very well and good and certainly the foundation for a fun little time-travel thriller -- and for the first third or so thats what ""Looper"" is from its stylish representation of the near future to the clever way Johnson lays out the exposition and the rules for the story. (Paul Danos character finds out the hard way what Abe and his goons do to loopers who fail to close the loop.) But by the time younger Joe hides out at the farm owned by Sara (Emily Blunt) to lie in wait for older Joe the movie starts bogging down in circular storytelling and general meandering leading to a viewing experience that feels awfully padded at two hours-plus. And none of this is helped by the idea of Emily Blunt as a woman who lives on a farm Thats the second-least convincing aspect of ""Looper."" Number one is Gordon-Levitts makeup job -- rather than allow us to believe that the actor could simply age into becoming Bruce Willis Johnson has decided to all but hide the ""Inception"" star under a thick layer of latex or CG effects or whatever it is thats going on with his face. Theres never that magic moment when say you stop thinking ""Thats Nicole Kidman with a fake nose"" and instead decide ""Thats Virginia Woolf."" From start to finish Gordon-Levitts face will make you think ""Why does he look like the love child of Kirk Cameron and Robert Forster?"" (Besides its not like we dont know what Bruce Willis actually looked like 30 years ago. Couldnt they just have put Gordon-Levitt into one of those white tuxes from the ""Moonlighting"" TV show and handed him a Seagrams wine cooler?) By the time the inevitable time-travel paradoxes start kicking in -- how could that be there if in the new reality this was no longer the other thing? -- ""Looper"" has long since wasted its own potential. When it eventually pops up on cable youll have the option of mastering time and space by watching the first 20 or 30 minutes and then turning it off forever. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Comments (3) click to enlarge Looper Rated R  119 minutes  2012 This noirish time travel saga by Rian Johnson (Brick The Brothers Bloom) brims with visual detail and imaginative camera set-ups though it doesnt leave much of an aftertaste. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a contract killer in the mid-21st century whose targets are sent back to him from 30 years in the future; things get hairy when his latest victim turns out to be an older version of himself played by Bruce Willis in his rueful hangdog mode. The dystopian setting in which all U.S. infrastructure has eroded and everyone has a price on his head makes for some bold cultural commentary but as usual with Johnson the engaging ideas feel like affectations rather than products of a fully developed sensibility. With Emily Blunt Piper Perabo and Jeff Daniels who steals his every scene as a sullen mob boss.

Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday September 27 2012 149 PM Title Looper Film Info R Violence language. Area theaters. The trick for any time-travel movie is to make its sci-fi mumbo-jumbo fun without distracting from the story. In other words the tail cant wag the dog -- but it does need to keep him going in circles. The antihero of the infinitely entertaining ""Looper"" knows his own circle will close someday. His name is Joe and in 2044 hes a thirtyish thug (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) hired by a man from the future named Abe (Jeff Daniels). Joe is a ""looper"" an assassin whose skills are used by an evil government in the year 2074. How is that? Well though time travel hasnt been invented yet in 2044 it is available three decades later. When someone needs to be killed in the future to avoid mess theyre zapped back to the past. There in a cornfield Joe waits with a gun and an antique watch until his victim appears. Then he shoots him. RELATED HOW JOSEPH GORDON-LEVITT WAS TRANSFORMED INTO A YOUNG BRUCE WILLIS Yet theres an expiration date for guys like Joe. When their older selves are time-traveled back to the cornfield to ""close the loop"" they pop up in front of their younger selves gold bars taped to their backs as a payoff. (If they let their older selves go Abe makes sure both versions start losing limbs simultaneously.) Its here that writer-director Rian Johnson flips the deck in his action drama and not for the last time. In a long montage we see Joe age into a 60-year-old tough (played by Bruce Willis) whos left his violent past behind. Then were back in 2044 as young Joe lifts his gun and pauses when he realizes his next victim is himself. If that were all there was to ""Looper"" itd be enough. But Johnson in a nod to ""The Terminator"" adds another cool level. The old Joe tries to convince his younger self that the only way to avoid their shared fate -- and save the woman theyll eventually love -- is if they kill someone who in 30 years will develop a terrifying psychic power. But in 2044 their target is still a 5-year-old boy. Bruce Willis plays the older version of a time-traveling assassin in Looper. Yes ""Looper"" stacks the deck but if you hang with it it hangs together. Johnson (""Brick"") knows the storied history of this genre so he makes sure theres heart as well as a sometimes overly busy head especially in a subplot involving an unsuspecting bystander (Emily Blunt). As with last years ""Source Code"" this is the rare action movie that rewards viewers who pay attention. The one bit of attention that ""Looper"" may not want is the slightly odd makeup on Gordon-Levitt. Instead of resembling a younger Willis the ""Dark Knight Rises"" actor looks like Burt Reynolds in ""Gator."" But no matter. Gordon-Levitt is flinty and Willis on his A-game is fiery. Together they take us on a helluva trip. Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

In The City -- it could be wicked Wichita or up-to-later-date Kansas City -- most folks must beg for food on streets strewn with junkyard-reject cars. The Citys one percent includes a class of underground overlords the creme de la crime who ride cool hoverbikes party at louche nightclubs and ingest a hallucinogenic drug through eye drops. Murder certainly pays for Joe Simmons (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a ""looper"" whose job is to kill people sent back from 30 years in the future when backwards time travel has been perfected outlawed and criminalized. The victims pop up kneeling and hooded and Joe blasts them away with his blunderbuss. Problem is that when the loopers survive into the 2070s they too will be bagged teleported and killed. As Joe notes ""This job doesnt tend to attract the most forward-thinking people."" Set in two points in the future -- 2044 Kansas and 2074 Shanghai -- Rian Johnsons knotty gnarly sci-fi drama Looper doesnt bother much with elaborate imaginings of the bleak world ahead of us. No spaceships or Star Trek uniforms are on display and no next-generation gadgets except for the hoverbikes and the time-travel device a clunky gray apparatus that looks like a washing machine made in Stalins Russia. Nor do emissaries from the 2070s try clarifying time travel for the uninitiated. ""This time-travel sh-t fries your brain like an egg"" shrugs Abe (Jeff Daniels) the Fagin from the future who employs Joe. (READ Stephanie Abrahams interview with Joseph Gordon-Levitt) Another man who tells Joe he cant be bothered with an explanation that involves ""makin diagrams with straws"" has a vaguely familiar affect -- partly because he is played by Bruce Willis mainly because he is Joe transported 30 years from the future. In 2074 Shanghai he had retired from the murder business and found love with a Chinese woman (Qing Xu). When his beloved was killed and he was summoned by a mysterious supervillain known only as the Rainmaker to be terminally looped Older Joe overcame his captors jumped into that Soviet-era Maytag and zapped himself back to 2044 to change history as he knows it -- to restore his lost love. This sacred mission means mortal danger for at least two people a woman Sara (Emily Blunt) living in farmland isolation and her unusual child Cid (Pierce Gagnon). (READ Corlisss tribute to Bruce Willis in a review of Surrogates) Does your head hurt reading this? Mine did writing it. If a two-time viewer of Looper may simplify the plot for first-timers the movie is The Terminator with a twist. It suggests that the young son of a nice smart strong single mom might be the scourge not the savior of the future. So Looper juggles two weighty themes whether nurture can overcome nature in the incubation of a potentially monstrous personality; and in the matter of the two Joes whether homicide can be suicide. Can a young man resolve to kill his older self? A fanciful film with the patina of hyper-realism Looper is well served by actors who behave not as if they were dropped carelessly into the future but spent their whole desperate lives there. Daniels playing a 2070s man transferred to the 2040s as if it were the foreign posting for a career Army man carries himself with the wise weariness of a middle-management killer. Paul Dano in a small role as the heros hapless friend -- sort of an Elisha Cook Jr. to Joes Humphrey Bogart -- is a Jell-O blob of neuroses wildly agitated and instantly disposable. Gagnon is creepy-good as Cid and Blunt goes appealingly sinewy as a farm woman tending a cane field. (Cane fields in Kansas you ask? Like a dozen or so other films released this year including 21 Jump Street The Lucky One The Campaign Killing Them Softly The Paperboy Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter and both Expendableses this movie was actually shot in Louisiana.) (READ Belinda Luscombes profile of fashionable Emily Blunt) In his impressive debut feature Brick made in 2003 and released three years later Johnson imposed the intricacies of a Raymond Chandler detective novel on a high-school milieu (with Gordon-Levitt as a teen Philip Marlowe). Looper is another such hothouse hybrid mashing Quentin Tarantino and Philip K. Dick into a species of pulp science fiction. Not content to create a retro-future world where young Joe sports natty jackets and thin ties (""The movies that youre dressin like"" Abe tells him ""are just copyin other movies"") Johnson also wants to force a physical resemblance between the actors playing Joe. How does Gordon-Levitt start to morph into Bruce Willis? With the help of makeup and possibly some digital sorcery around the mouth Clutch Cargo-style. (Joe also passes through a brief phase when he looks like Jimmy Kimmel.) (READ Corlisss blurb on Brick) None of this was mandatory since the connection of the two Joes is evident from the get-go but Johnson may think the audience needs persuading to believe that Gordon-Levitt the former child star whose adult career has been defined by nice-guy roles in (500) Days of Summer and 50/50 could ever mature into the Die Hard tough guy. Prosthetics and visual effects aside its still a weird fit. The actors are separated by more than age; they represent different views of the movie male now or 30 to 60 years in the future. Theyre so different in fact that those watching Looper may wish to see a movie covering the three intervening decades that turned the young cocky but essentially soft Joe into the haunted hard case who would risk his life and kill hundreds including a few children to revive the woman he loved. That could be a splendid sequel to the fascinating -- if not quite fabulous -- double-helix Looper.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Heres whats so awesome about Looper Its a futuristic time-travel movie in which more or less the entire last hour takes place on a farm. And thats just one of the many ways writer-director Rian Johnson subverts expectations. This is a ""you know what would be cool?"" movie that considers the real-world ramifications of its science-fiction whiz-bang and a film of ideas that doesnt skimp on the action. Most of all Looper asks questions about whether a mans destiny is locked into place--not because the future has already been written but because of the kind of person he is. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as a lifelong neer-do-well who takes a job as a specialized kind of assassin who kills and disposes of people sent back through time by the gangsters of the future. As Gordon-Levitt explains up top in voiceover once time-travel has been discovered--a few decades after 2044 when Looper is mostly set--its immediately outlawed and becomes the province of a demimonde that uses the technology to cover up its crimes. Gordon-Levitt was recruited into this ""looper"" job as a kid which is almost like winning the lottery in the world of 2044. Loopers dress snappy drive souped-up jet-propulsion vehicles carry booming old-timey rifles and get paid in silver bars all of which places them among the upper-middle-class of the mid-21st century. Problems ensue once Gordon-Levitt and the other loopers start recognizing that theyre increasingly each being asked to kill older versions of themselves which ""closes the loop"" and ends their contracts complete with a big payday and a retirement party. Some are wary of the implications of this wondering whatll happen to them in the decades to come though most are too busy spending their bonus money to dwell on it for long. Then Gordon-Levitts older self--played by Bruce Willis--comes back escapes and announces that hes going to fix everything via extraordinary measures that Gordon-Levitt is determined to stop. Viewers may bicker afterward about whether the time-travel in Looper makes sense--a criticism Johnson attempts to defuse via Willis comment that the whole process is ""cloudy""--but undoubtedly the world of Looper has been carefully planned. Johnson doesnt just throw cultural societal or fashion trends into the movie for weirdness sake; he makes the characters retro clothing central to the movies ""everything recurs"" theme and he works the existence of telekinesis and roving vagrant mobs subtly into the background of the action so he can foreground them as needed. That level of care extends to the supporting roles and performances which do more than just take up the spaces around Gordon-Levitt and Willis. Johnson makes good use of the usually bothersome Paul Dano who puts his shriller attributes into play as a flashy looper whose problems plague Gordon-Levitt. Piper Perabo and Garret Dillahunt each get a couple of showcase scenes as a showgirl and an enforcer respectively. Jeff Daniels is hilariously world-weary and rumpled as a mob boss from the future whos back in 2044 reluctantly monitoring the looper program. (Daniels has Loopers best lines which is saying something because as Johnson showed with his Brick and The Brothers Bloom he has a good ear for dialogue.) But the heart of the movie belongs to Emily Blunt as an iron-willed farmer looking after her whip-smart son (Pierce Gagnon who gives one of the most assured performances by a child in movies this year running a close second to Quvenzhane Wallis in Beasts Of The Southern Wild). After Willis escapes Gordon-Levitt the latter determines that Willis will head to Blunts farm eventually so he camps out there and gets involved in the life of this steely woman and her strange little boy. Just when it seems like Looper is gearing up for a mind-blowing adventure in the distant future it settles into more down-to-earth shootouts and chases in city streets and country roads all haunted by the prospect of what the audience has been told will become of these shooters and chasers. Outside of one jarring timeline hiccup Loopers how-the-present-affects-the-future shenanigans dont jumble the narrative significantly. (Though there is one cool visual sequence that takes a few seconds to process as a looper from the future watches his body fall apart while his past self is getting vivisected.) Thats because Looper isnt playing clever time-games for their own sake but rather considering their impact on the characters. Johnsons main visual motif is cloudiness suggesting how moments curl around each other forming patterns. A lot of the people in Looper are dealing with similar issues--addiction dead parents life-changing love affairs--and the movie subtly explores the ways their mistakes recur from life to life and time to time. Comparisons to 12 Monkeys are inevitable given Willis presence though really Looper is reminiscent of The Matrix--not so much in terms of its style or plot but in that its so fully realized and populated with memorable scenes and delightful character turns. And like The Matrix Looper has a strong emotional core as its two protagonists--young and old--embody the cycle of selfishness they see all around them and show the potential for one person to break it. The odd logical inconsistency aside Looper is a remarkable feat of imagination and execution entertaining from start to finish even as it asks the audience to contemplate how and why humanity keeps making the same rotten mistakes.

The year is 2074 -- when come to think of it todays college freshmen will still be roaming the earth. Yet time travel is already possible if illegal given the havoc such historical leapfrogging could wreak. The situation is good business though for a ring of gangsters led by a mysterious boss called the Rainmaker who with his henchmen runs a lucrative assassination business in the shadows They ship designated victims back in time 30 years and employ Mob foot soldiers called ""loopers"" stationed in 2044 to take care of business -- no muss no fuss no evidence. The bound and hooded victim arrives zzzzp through a wormhole in time and space and the looper shoots the vic kablooey dead (a clunky blunderbuss is the firearm of choice). Then the assassin collects his pay parties hard (numbed by recreational drugs in the form of eyedrops) and waits for his next job. In the worst-case scenario the assignment requires ""closing the loop."" Thats when the unfortunate schmo scheduled for termination turns out to be the loopers future self -- and when life starts resembling an existential Mobius strip. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays one such unfortunate schmo a soul-deadened blunderbuss-toting drug-numbed time-traveling employee named Joe. When this average Joe balks at closing his own loop he messes with the laws of the universe. Gordon-Levitt also messes with our heads because he appears both familiar and not so. The always compelling ever more impressive actor is seven years older than he was when he first worked with Looper writer-director Rian Johnson on the filmmakers first feature Brick. But with the help of subtle prosthetic work Gordon-Levitt not only looks older and more mature in Looper; around the nose lip and eyebrow he also looks a little like someone else. Like Bruce Willis in fact. Which is only right since Willis plays Joe of the future. Eluding fate and escaping when younger Joe hesitates to pull the trigger older Joe now hunts the Rainmaker to settle a terrible score. And younger Joe endangering the criminal enterprise when he breaks his contract now has the Rainmakers wrath to fear. (Jeff Daniels effortlessly steals his scenes as the lieutenant in charge of the looper operation a major thug with an attitude closer to that of the Dude than of a mobster.) The story itself twists and loops finding its way eventually to a farmhouse in a Kansas cornfield the land protected by an intrepid lady (Emily Blunt) whos got a shotgun and isnt afraid to use it to protect the little boy who lives there with her. Blunt makes an unlikely homesteader. But then as he demonstrated in his previous two brainy fantasy features the brink between the unlikely and the intriguing is Johnsons favorite fault line. In Brick (2005) he interposed a stylized noirish hard-boiled detective story in a contemporary suburban high school setting; in The Brothers Bloom (2008) he had heady fun with games played by a pair of stylized con men who might have dropped by from the set of a Wes Anderson movie. The time swivels in Looper evoke some of Inceptions fancy temporal tricks (some of which of course also involved Gordon-Levitt straddling multiple time zones at once). But its the glimpses of Children of Men-like societal dystopia that give the movie its real weight and distinguish Johnsons third feature as a marked step forward. While its fun to watch Gordon-Levitt prowl around in skinny hipster duds looking downtown-jaded amusing to watch Willis in sturdy bald-action-hero middle age and a kick to see the two Joes size each other up at a diner sit-down its positively jolting to observe the gap between the haves and the have-nots the privileged and the poor that Looper predicts for 2044 -- a blink-of-an-eye 32 years away. (The rich literally mow down the poor in the streets.) Gee-whiz innovations in fast cars and cool digital communications gizmos do nothing to help crumbling American infrastructure. Looper whispers that the future is now and its time to wipe the drops from our eyes or else get stuck in a loop an endless cycle a rut.

Looper Good Director Rian Johnson. Cast Joseph Gordon-Levitt Bruce Willis Emily Blunt. Rating R for strong violence language some sexuality/nudity and drug content. First off um people its a movie. About time travel. Rigorous realism might not be a requirement here. Second director-writer Rian Johnson wisely pays more attention to the characters than the sci-fi details. Not that he ignores them; as these things go it seems like the pieces of the puzzle fit. Interview Gordon-Levitt director But we care more about Joseph Gordon-Levitts character than we do whether the rules of the Butterfly Effect are strictly followed. Bruce Willis is also good in the same role. Huh? Same role? See time-travel above. In 2074 time travel has been achieved. It is also quickly outlawed given all the opportunity to mess with the future (which is somebodys present). And you know what they say When time travel is outlawed only outlaws will use time travel. Or something like that. And they do for a specific purpose. An unseen mob boss called the Rainmaker uses it to send people he needs killed back to 2044 where hired killers called ""loopers"" stand waiting with a blunderbuss ready to blow the victims away as soon as they appear. Thus in the future the victim never even existed. Its a lucrative job but there is one problem Eventually the loopers inevitably have to kill the future version of themselves. They dont even know it usually till the job is done. Its called closing the loop and it sets the clock ticking on the rest of the loopers life. Most loopers accept this. But occasionally their future self will escape which causes all sorts of problems. They are hunted down ruthlessly. It isnt pretty. Joe (Gordon-Levitt) is a looper stashing away his money so that he can eventually move to France. There is a funny bit in which his boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) sent back by the Rainmaker from 2074 to run things and who is as friendly as he is cold-blooded tries to convince Joe he should go to China instead. Nope Joe insists. France. ""Look Im from the future"" Abe says. ""Go to China."" Eventually of course Joe must close the loop. When his future self played by Willis arrives for assassination without the hood the victims usually wear recognition flashes in their eyes and in that moment of hesitation future Joe gets away. Present-day Joe knows he has to catch and kill him; of course future Joe knows this too and doesnt plan on letting that happen. Besides the future Joe has work to do. Operating on a few clues about what little is known about the Rainmaker future Joe wants to find him and kill him to prevent him from ever making it to 2074. That the Rainmaker would be a little boy in 2044 doesnt phase future Joe. While chasing future Joe present-day Joe also has to run from Abe and his goons. He hides out at a farmhouse where Sara (Emily Blunt) is raising her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) who has a more-pronounced version of the psychic power some people including his mom have developed. The money scene not surprisingly is when the two Joes meet sitting across from one another at a diner. Gordon-Levitt and Willis look nothing alike of course but with some prosthetic work and blue contacts Johnson manages to make it work for the most part. Its strange at first because you cant quite figure out whats different about Gordon-Levitts appearance especially in close-ups. But its not so distracting as to take you out of the story. Good thing. ""Looper"" requires your attention though in an enjoyable way. Gordon-Levitt has been so terrific for a while now that hes become a magnetic presence; Willis is also on a nice streak not as strong here as in ""Moonrise Kingdom"" but still quite good. Johnsons story has some nice twists; it too closes the loop in surprising and satisfying fashion. The best advice is to not overthink ""Looper"" as Johnsons already done that. Instead just sit back and enjoy it. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Looper | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; looper ) Looper (United States/China 2012) September 25 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Looper is a tremendous motion picture experience. Not merely a ""very good"" one but a great one. It delivers on all possible levels and its missteps are few and minor. Its a rousing science fiction/fantasy tale with a dose of hard-hitting drama an edgy approach that denies Hollywoods penchant for formula and a smart script that was crafted with care and an attention to detail. For writer/director Rian Johsnson Looper represents a worthy follow-up to his earlier offbeat efforts Brick and The Brothers Bloom. Its the best title on an impressive filmography. Time travel is a fantasy concept and as such is subject only to the rules imposed upon it by a writer. Most filmmakers who elect to employ it resort to clichA(c)s and dont spend a lot of time carefully considering the implications of paradoxes. This is not the case with Looper. Although Johnsons interpretation of time travel cannot be said to be any more ""realistic"" than any other it feels that way. There are rules that the screenplay does not violate. More importantly it doesnt resort to ""twists"" that have become so commonplace that they are no longer surprising. Loopers time travel backstory is sufficiently detailed for a sense of verisimilitude without getting bogged down in the minutia of detail. It offers well-developed characters plenty of action and suspense at least one sequence of bloody mayhem a dollop of moral ambiguity and an ending that does not disappoint. It is intellectually satisfying and emotionally powerful. Its a compelling story told in the best manner imaginable making this unquestionably among the years best. The majority of the action unfolds in Kansas circa 2044. The world isnt that different from what it is today. The cities are bigger and dirtier but rural living is much the same. There are still corn fields single family houses and axes for chopping wood. The criminal element is gaining power but they do not have the oppressive power they will obtain 30 years in the future. By the early 2070s time travel has been discovered but it is illegal and used only by the most powerful criminals. Because bodies cannot be disposed of in the future those who fun afoul of the syndicates are hog-tied and sent back in time to 2044 where they are met by a ""looper"" with a shotgun. He finishes the job takes his reward (bars of silver strapped to the victim) and waits for his next assignment. When the decision is made to terminate a loopers contact he is sent a future version of himself to eliminate (""closing the loop""). Once he has completed that task the clock is ticking on 30 years of life. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a looper. In fact hes not just any looper hes one of the best in the small stable run by gang lord Abe (Jeff Daniels). There comes a time however when Joe makes the mistake of harboring a friend (Paul Dano) who has screwed up. Soon after that Joe is given an assignment that puts him face-to-face with his future self (Bruce Willis). When he hesitates Old Joe knocks him out and goes on the run. This puts Joe in a bad position. Unless he rectifies things quickly he will end up dead not just in the future but in the present as well. A brief conversation with Old Joe gives him some clues about his aged selfs intentions and a location where he will eventually go. So Joe travels there not to protect Sara (Emily Blunt) the woman who owns the house or her son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) but to stop Old Joe and restore his life. And he has a distinct advantage in any confrontation he can kill his future self but Old Joe cant reciprocate. Discussion of Looper in any detail would involve revealing developments both small and large that are better discovered on ones own. The story isnt a labyrinth of twists and turns but it isnt necessarily predictable and there are a few genuine surprises that work effectively because they make sense in the context of the narrative not because theyre thrown at us to provoke a reaction. The time travel element leads to occasional instances of minor confusion but especially for those familiar with this branch of science fiction/fantasy storytelling much of what occurs is logical meaning it plays by the rules Johnson establishes. My opinion of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an actor has been growing with each new performance and despite being saddled with odd face prosthetics to make him appear more ""Bruce Willis-like"" this is no exception. His ability and range continue to impress. This is not an easy role. It requires him to spend a majority of the movie as an anti-hero. He is after all a cold-blooded assassin and a good one at that. Despite that we develop a connection with him as the seeds of something more noble begin to sprout. Bruce Willis deserves second billing. This is Gordon-Levitts film; Willis role although crucial is smaller. With movies like this one and Moonrise Kingdom its easy to forgive throw-away garbage like The Cold Light of Day. For the most part Willis performance in Looper is dramatic but he gets an opportunity to kick ass big-time. One of the great strengths of Looper is that it gives Willis like Gordon-Levitt a variety of opportunities to transcend stereotypes. He is provided not only with action sequences but scenes of intense dramatic power. Theres a moment when you may loathe Old Joe but as conveyed by Willis perhaps no more than he loathes himself. And with that hatred comes a disturbing understanding. The rest of the cast is comprised of supporting actors doing excellent jobs in appearances that vary from a few scenes (Paul Dano) to a significant chunk of the running length (Emily Blunt). Theres not a poor performance to be found. Especially good are Jeff Daniels as the surprisingly agreeable head of the syndicate and Piper Perabo as a sympathetic hooker/stripper who interacts in different ways with Joe and his older self. Emily Blunt may be the sexiest wood chopper in the history of motion pictures. For me a great film is one in which all the elements are well done. They blend together like a symphony. Thats the case here. The screenplay is clever and intelligent; it piqued my interest and kept me involved. The characters are well-rounded and powerfully portrayed. Theres plenty of action and suspense and even a little humor and romance mixed in. There are some profoundly disturbing questions that have no easy answers. (Im reminded of the time travel hypothetical If you could travel to 1889 and stand by a crib containing the infant Adolf Hitler could you strangle the baby?) The art direction is impressive suggesting a futuristic world that is familiar yet different. Theres a strong emotional element to all of this. Looper accomplishes what top-notch cinema should do it diverts entertains and enriches. It will not impact my worldview or the way I go about my daily living but I will not soon forget it and I am grateful for having seen it.

When the younger Joe asks the older one about the specifics of temporal displacement the latter dismisses the question telling his interlocutor what a waste of time it would be to sit there all day drawing ""diagrams with straws.""Johnson would agree. His is a mind-fuck movie less interested in geeking out on the details of how exactly past and future intermingle than in investigating the moral implications of a charged situation grounded in character. No sooner does the film lay out the ground rules of its time-travel setup in almost didactically precise voiceovers than it turns its characters loose to make their own life-altering choices.In short for all its affectionate pastiche Looper is a humanist movie and is all the better for it. Taking place in the year 2042 it establishes a new type of underworld figure the eponymous practitioner of dirty deeds among whose number is Joe as played by Gordon-Levitt heavily made up to resemble a younger Willis. Joe tells us ""Time travel has not yet been invented but 30 years from now it will have been""; as such the gangsters who run the world in 2072 use the quickly outlawed practice to send people they wish to assassinate back in time to 2042 at which point loopers are poised to drop them the moment they appear and then dispose of the bodies.Film Details Looper RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time118 More Info But because time travel is illegal in the future the loopers themselves must be eliminated and so the criminals ultimately send these hired assassins back in time to be offed oftentimes by their older selves. Such is the case when ""future"" Joe (Willis) appears in the crosshairs of his younger counterparts gun before the latter botches the hit and allows his older incarnation to run wild. Old Joe searches for the child who will become the future mob boss in order to kill him before he takes power and institutes his system of eliminating loopers while his younger self hides out on a farm owned by a tough-talking single mother Sara (Emily Blunt) who is raising a kid whose tantrums and telekinetic powers seem to indicate that he might grow up into that very kingpin. Meanwhile the organization sends out its men to track down both versions of Joe.Johnson first made his name with 2005s Brick which transported the plotting mood and speech patterns of a classic noir to a contemporary high school. The director followed that with 2008s The Brothers Bloom which wore its Wes Anderson-derived quirk on its perfectly manicured sleeve. With Looper the borrowings are no less obvious whether in the plotting (recent sci-fi mind-fuckers like Primer and Timecrimes vie with elements of noir and Bad Seed-style bad toddler behavior) the settings (the dystopian city of the future is drawn from countless cinematic models) or specific touches (the hired thugs in 2072 dress like spaghetti western bandits). But Looper isnt about its references. Instead theyre firmly woven into the fabric of the work. As Joes boss (Jeff Daniels) explains to his style-conscious hireling dismissing the latters emphasis on superficial image-making the movies hes copying in shaping his physical appearance are themselves copies of other movies.Does this amount to self-critique? If so its a gentle one. But as Gordon-Levitt ages into Willis he trades his youthful obsession with flash for a more satisfying relationship to the adult world. As the film evolves into an ethical quandary it raises questions about what people will do to protect both their loved ones and their own happiness and wonders what value individual happiness merits when placed against the fate of the world.If the ending seems a little too hedge-betting Looper nonetheless satisfies wholly on the level of dramatic necessity. Thrilling in its deft juggling of complex narrative elements utterly clear in its presentation and unfolding with what feels like serious moral purpose Looper still cant help but suggest that its larger ambitions are something of a put-on a nice thematic polish to set off its interpersonal drama. But theres no shame in a film that favors the human scale over abstract philosophizing or meta-cinematic frippery. For Johnson the inveterate pasticheur it qualifies as a significant step forward.

Our dapper antihero Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) lives in a violent socially deteriorating Kansas City of 2044 where he works as an assassin of mob targets who are beamed from the future to land in the sights of his shotgun. Its clock-punching drudgery for him until an oddly familiar face stares back his own. (This future Joe is played touchingly by Bruce Willis; well allow for 30 years of thickening.) The latter dude escapes into the weeds and eventually the two find themselves barely divided antagonists in a struggle to change the course of history. Sounds grand yes but Looper lets you consider the ripples on your own. Shockingly (at least to this previously unconvinced viewer) all of this panache has been mustered by 38-year-old writer-director Rian Johnson who burst out of the gate with 2005s Brick and never got clear of his cloyingly clever dialogue. What a fine thing age has brought him. Now Johnson appears to love wordless montages--in one sequence the years fly by romantically--and enjoys exploring the relaxed camaraderie between old foes. He seems to have spent some evenings watching Witness (a vulnerable boy figures prominently) and he knows his way around a farms sun-dappled topology. Looper tries (and fails) for a love-against-all-odds resonance but the shortcomings are minimal. Johnsons still got plenty of unlooped time to grab that brass ring.

Has the star of Inception lost a fight with an orbital sander? His nose is oddly flat his forehead unnaturally smooth. Its distracting - which is a problem because Looper offers the kind of head-bending sci-fi that you dont want to be distracted from. Look away and youll miss something important.The face is intentional of course like a futuristic take on the surgerised celebrity lookalikes in LA Confidential Gordon-Levitt has had a digital facelift to make him resemble Bruce Willis. In fact his character gangland assassin Joe is destined to become Willis drop back through a portal in time and confront his current self. Confused? If you pay attention you wont be.The plot of writer-director Rian Johnsons third feature is far too convoluted to explain lets just say it involves time travel organised crime future terrorism death loss hope regret and genetic mutation. But its to Johnsons credit that for the attentive viewer none of these frantic plot contortions ever becomes bewildering Looper lays out a wealth of clever intriguing concepts lucidly and with precision.Not that any of these ideas is particularly new. Both the time-travel structure and a late-arriving even more compelling subplot involving Emily Blunt as an isolated woman with a unique child are familiar from decades of sci-fi notably The Terminator Twelve Monkeys and Jerome Bixbys wonderful 1953 short story Its a Good Life (memorably adapted for The Twilight Zone).But as with his 2005 debut Brick its how Johnson organises these elements that makes Looper special. Nothing is predictable or comfortable both the beautifully designed world of Kansas City 2042 and the characters who inhabit it feel entirely real but also consistently surprising and often disconcerting. As the older version of Joe brutalised by grief and self-hatred Willis has never played such an unsympathetic role although both Gordon-Levitt and Blunt give strong performances its Willis youll remember. With this and Moonrise Kingdom hes on a roll.Looper isnt the super-smart sci-fi masterpiece many had hoped for logically it doesnt quite add up and there are slow spells. But if Johnsons main aim was to strike a balance between conceptual cleverness and multiplex thrills he could hardly have done better. This is a hugely satisfying enjoyable and thoughtful movie.

Terrible and quite distasteful in places in that disturbing way some modern films seem to lack morality - the child target the constant repetitive shotgun assassinations casually expecting us to enjoy the sight of hooded figures kneeling on tarpaulins being blasted across a field. And then we are expected to like the assassin Why couldnt they just have beamed the victims straight into the furnace and given us all a break? I agree with others it is an amalgam of other films painting by numbers it is terribly acted what a cliche the Emily Blunt character is.

The movie is no good 1. The story idea is good but not well thought out in the scenes or storyline and so amateur. 2. In a fictional movie especially for the most part pointless like this one there is no justification for depicting assassinating a child. 3. Bruce Willis cannot act. 4. It is neither original nor a well drafted or performed story and so not any good.

By David Edelstein Published Sep 23 2012 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Sony Pictures) You must remember this The fundamental things dont apply as time goes by in the ballyhooed time-travel thriller Looper. In the fat gob of exposition that opens the film Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) the protagonist and narrator explains that time travel exists in the future but its illegal. But for some inexplicable reason the mob finds it expedient to send the bodies of people they want murdered back to the past (i.e. the films present 2042) where theyre disposed of by loopers like Joe. (Question Once cops in the future discover the practice wouldnt the corpses route be easy to trace?) For some other inexplicable reason aged loopers in the future are sent back to the past to be shot by younger looperswho would seem on minimal reflection the least reliable assassins given their ties to the people theyre supposed to kill (not infrequently their older selves). However if the loopers dont shoot the old loopers they (the young ones) will be hideously mutilatedbut not killed since killing them would change the future. (Question Wouldnt sawing off their limbs change the future too?) Joes boss Abe (Jeff Daniels) tries to splain all this to Joe and then throws up his hands and says Time-travel shit fries your brain like an eggthe sort of line a friend calls a Get Out of Jail Free card that filmmakers give themselves. Getting permission to be bewildered is a gift to the audience too. You can relax and enjoy the movie which delivers in spite of its iffy logic. At the recent Toronto International Film Festival Looper was acclaimed for its stylishness and narrative invention which testifies to writer-director Rian Johnsons greatest talent making clumsy storytelling look tricky and sophisticated. Tropes from Blade Runner Twelve Monkeys and the odd French New Wave thriller are mixed and matched to give the illusion youre watching an existential mystery. Joe the looper turns out to be a junkie who gives no thought to future consequences (Quelle ironie) styling himself like a twentieth-century American movie-star crook (or like Jean-Paul Belmondo in Breathless styling himself like a twentieth-century American movie-star crook). Early on he sins in his own eyes by going all Judas on a looper pal (a mewling Paul Dano) who let his older self get away. Joe barely has time to ease his consciencehe offers a hooker his filthy lucre so she can start a new life with her sonbefore hes staring down his gun at his own older self (Bruce Willisand no the two Joes dont mesh in your headWilliss personality is too distinct). Young and Old Joe do not like each other one bit. Why dont you do what old men do and die? Take your little gun out from between your legs and do it boy etc. The second half of Looper is part The Terminator part Stephen Kings Firestarter. The elite loopers (Gats) chase Joe whos chasing Old Joe whos hunting someone who will grow up in the future to be a mighty looper-killer called the Rainmaker. Young Joe stumbles onto the farm of hillbilly Emily Blunt who points a shotgun into her wheat and yells Ah will cut you the fuck in hay-alf She has a strange little boy (Pierce Gagnon) with pouty lips a big head and temper tantrums so forceful she has to tuck herself into a steel cabinet and shut the door. Looper is all over the placea series of barely aligned loop-de-loopsbut if high-toned futuristic time-travel pictures with a splash of romance float your boat the way they do mine youll have yourself a time. The climax is tumultuous the payoff happy and sad in the right measure. The future might be ghastly but heroism lives. The stars work hard Gordon-Levitt to purge all traces of his puppy-dog persona Willis to suppress his smirk Blunt to smooth transitions that would trip up lesser actresses. (Her face seems incapable of registering a banal emotion.) Jeff Daniels creates the years most hateable bad guy by gazing on unfortunates with moist sympathetic eyes before shattering their bones with a ball-peen hammer. As I left the theater I heard two people in nearby aisles trying to explain different plot points to their companions. I didnt listen. That information should only be dispensed on a need-to-know basis. Looper Directed by Rian Johnson. Sony Pictures/Tristar. R. E-mail filmcriticnewyorkmag.com. Share this story...

His less successful followup the playful caper flick ""The Brothers Bloom"" contained a similarly tricky narrative that took multiple unexpected turns. As Johnson demonstrated a clear penchant for the interplay between reality and fantasy it makes sense that he would eventually enter the science-fiction realm. ""Looper"" a rollicking dystopian action-adventure yarn about time travel is a reasonable broadening of the filmmakers scope with enough potential to make its flaws stand out. The first hour displays a brilliant elaboration on the noir antics demonstrated in ""Brick"" but the movies later scenes stumble in a mass of half-formed ideas. Nevertheless craftsmanship holds ""Looper"" together during its concluding moments so that the skill behind the camera remains in focus resulting in an experience nearly as fragmented as the time-traveling antics at its center. Read More of Indiewires Extensive Toronto Film Festival Coverage Reteaming with ""Brick"" star Joseph Gordon-Levitt Johnson has written the typically ebullient actor a dreary role with plenty of noir-inflected dialogue. Set in 2044 the story casts Gordon-Levitt as clandestine hitman Joe part of a secretive group hired by employers from a future 30 years away where time travel has been invented. With a workmanlike sense of calm Joe routinely heads to a desolate area where veiled targets from the future abruptly appear on schedule. The job is chillingly simple He pulls the trigger collects his loot and calls it a day. Having established his routine in a moody first-person voiceover Joe tacks on the catch At a certain point the organization that hires loopers fires them by sending back their futures selves so that the younger killers can wipe them out. The imminent deadline means that most loopers have made peace with their limited time. ""This job doesnt attract forward-thinking people"" Joe deadpans although he has enough cunning to plot a means of capitalizing on his limited time Studying up on his French Joe hopes to cash out spend his later years exploring Europe. A soulful character looking to get out Joe faces a classic struggle thats not nearly as impressive as the world Johnson constructs to surround his creation. With small touches -- a flying car here a nifty technical device there -- ""Looper"" makes its dark near future into a palpable reality replete with a struggling impoverished class that makes the latest recession look like downright pedestrian. READ MORE Toronto 2012 Rian Johnson on His Opening-Night Film Looper and How the Festival World Has Changed Joe isnt invulnerable to the hard times Addicted to a nameless futuristic narcotic that takes the form of eyedrops he wanders through the weary cycle of his profession in a daze. Johnson also crafts a series of colorful coworkers including Paul Dano in a fleeting but enjoyably high energy turn and a looper boss played by Jeff Daniels. Characteristically frumpy Daniels performance is an unconventional choice for a menacing bad guy but hes competent enough until a point where the movie basically forgets about him. Naturally the self-extermination responsibility that all loopers eventually face takes center stage and the movie launches into its brisk plot. When Danos character allows his older self to escape the men learn that a murky new future boss named The Rainmaker has issued a mandate to execute all existing loopers. Unfazed Joe keeps his head down until his own future self (Bruce Willis) shows up and knocks the younger Joe unconscious before he can pull the trigger. A clever twist on the chase movie ensues with multiple layers of narrative unfolding at once A swift montage explores Joes life over the course of a three-decade period with an artful wordless explanation for his decision to rebel against the contract. Having fallen for the woman of his dreams Joe decides the only way to keep his life with her is to travel back to 2044 and kill The Rainmaker in his youth. Meanwhile the younger Joe still just wants to do his job. Establishing dueling stakes cleverly arranged to keep our sympathies at bay ""Looper"" launches into its final act. Up to this point the movie remains thoroughly engrossing for the way it demonstrates unbridled enthusiasm for its unique takes on various action-adventure formulas. Johnsons acrobatic camerawork swirls about his characters with a vibrant pulse that sets his imagery apart from the countless other near-future noirs unleashed since ""Blade Runner."" An early chase scene between the two Joes replayed from their varying points of view sets the bar high early on; its matched later by a tense showdown between the two men in a coffee shop where both vow to stick to their respective missions. Johnsons construction of ambiguous heroes and the implied idea of a man pitted against his former self maintains the thematic implications of the scenario with ease. Even then however indications of the troublesome later scenes begin to emerge. Willis low-key performance is often devoid of any expression whatsoever giving the distinct impression of a tired actor phoning it in. Gordon-Levitt is convincing enough but the decision to slather his face with makeup so that he looks more like the famous actor cast to play him in the future stands out as the one of many early distractions. Another is a subplot involving the development of telekinesis by countless future dwellers a separate sci-fi conceit from the time travel factor and one that never quite synchs with the rest of the plot (even the name the ""TK mutation"" underscores the fill-in-the-blank quality of the idea). Such qualms can be forgiven however; the major issues with the final scenes cannot. Pursued by the same authorities intent on eliminating his future self Joe flees to cornfields where he finds a young woman (Emily Blunt) and her alleged child Cid (Pierce Gagnon) possibly an early version of the proverbial Rainmaker. Joe knows that older Joe will eventually come to this countryside setting so he decides to wait it out. At that point ""Looper"" halts arriving a decidedly less interesting place devoid of the vivacious storytelling that precedes it. A creepy child seemingly stolen from the plot of ""Bad Seed"" Cid is an archetype that belongs to a different kind of movie so his borrowed status stands out -- as does the movies brash thundering finale where a barrage of violent showdowns and a half-baked twist stand in stark contrast to the brainier events that take place early on. Nevertheless it would be a disservice to discount the spectacular vision that keeps ""Looper"" in motion. Steve Yedlins cinematography and Johnsons icy screenplay demonstrate a fierce commitment to the prospects of intelligent science-fiction cinema a feat largely ignored by contemporary American filmmakers. Theres a adrenaline rush even in the problematic finish an eagerness that drives the filmmaking so that ""Looper"" is thrilling to watch even when it falls apart. Criticwire grade B HOW WILL IT PLAY? Sony will release ""Looper"" on September 28 having capitalized on buzz the film will undoubtedly receive as the opening night selection for the Toronto International Film Festival. Genre fans are likely to embrace the dystopic setting and the movies attitude so it stands a good chance at performing decently in wide release.

There is a shortlist of movies whose openings are mini-masterpieces of economic storytelling. An explosion of perfectly boiled-down moments stitched together with a dynamism and precision that simply does not let up. The gold medalist for me will forever be ""Annie Hall"" with ""Raising Arizona"" and ""GoodFellas"" nipping at its heels. It will take another viewing to confirm this but the whirlwind beginning of the high concept science fiction adventure ""Looper"" may be a new addition to this club. That second viewing is definitely in the cards for me not because ""Looper"" is difficult to follow but because Im still shocked and amazed that this time-travel movie made so much sense. In an age where filmmakers are more likely to to shrug and suggest you simply embrace mystery writer-director Rian Johnson (""The Brothers Bloom"") draws a line in the sand and says ""no."" He has ideas - fun ideas - and hes got a story to tell. Fans of rich sci-fi may want to keep a handkerchief on hand lest they find themselves drooling while those who simply like a fun adventure with great actors in juicy roles ought to have a good ride too. ""Looper"" is no doubt about it a terrific film. Its the future. Its a mess. Crime syndicates run everything and those looking for a way out of poverty are working for them. One job is as a Looper a low-rent assassin whose only skill is to be punctual. You go to a spot in a field wait for someone to magically appear then you blast them with a special kind of gun that never misses its target if used at close range. Also Check Out Stars Take the Red Carpet at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival Wait magically appear? Yes because in the far future (the futures future work with me)  they have invented time travel. Disposing of bodies is impossible in the future so the mob sends guys they want to whack back in time where no one will miss them. Being a Looper is steady work (with access to addictive drugs) and theres a nice severance package. You get a solid pay-out on the day you ""close your loop"" - when you kill your future self. (The crime lords like to sever all ties to the very illegal use of time travel.) On the day you close your loop you get a ticket to live 30 years in a party frenzy (or so it would seem) - but what happens when you cant kill your future self? Cant kill or wont kill? This and many other scenarios are played out and my Lord this is all still in the very first chunk of the movie and Im still leaving a boatload of stuff out. This alone makes ""Looper"" a studio movie with a genuine budget an absolute miracle. How the hell did the studio heads sit through the pitch? ""Looper""s star is ostensibly Joseph Gordon-Levitt but he shares an awful lot of the spotlight with his older self Bruce Willis. JGL (and a soupcon of makeup) evoke the spirit of Willis without resorting to mimicry. Its a very different type of role for him; hes sympathetic but frequently makes the wrong or selfish move. Willis is similarly layered. Its one of his quiet brooding performances similar to ""Unbreakable"" and while he may come off mean or amoral there are quick flashes justifying his behavior that are quite heartbreaking. Also check out 20 Films We Cant Wait to See in Toronto ""Looper"" is not flawless. There are a number of narrative twists (again how did this get greenlit?) and for my tastes the movie ends in a corner of the story less interesting to me than some of the other stuff. That there are so many crevices however is a testament to its world-building. From the billboards to the costumes to the weapons and props there is quite simply a surplus of stuff up there on the screen. I mean it took me until the end of the movie to realize that Garrett Dillahunt one of my favorite character actors was in this movie. Thats no diss against Dillahunt its a salute to the dizzying nature of the film. When the movie does eventually slow down it may shift a bit but it never stops making sense. All the sci-fi works. The paradoxes of time travel are shown rather than to paraphrase Willis character mapped out with straws on a table. I scribbled a number of questions during the film and upon reflection 98% of them were all answered in the text. The few niggling issues feel resolved in a thematic sense. This is in short a smart movie. Its also a movie that rarely gets made these days. ""12 Monkeys"" I suppose might be the last whacked-out big budget trip that felt so legit and so accomplished. Lets hope Bruce Willis can continue to come back to us for more.

A time-travel twister that pits a ruthless hit man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) against his future self (Bruce Willis) ""Looper"" marks a huge leap forward for Rian Johnson (""Brick""). His grandly conceived impressively mounted third feature shows a giddy geeky interest in science-fiction then forces it into the back seat and lets the multidimensional characters drive. In a genre infamous for loose ends this thinking mans thriller marshals action romance and a dose of very dark comedy toward a stunning payoff. Reception should be solid not stellar with a long cult afterlife. In the future mobsters dispose of unwanted rivals by sending them 30 years back to the past before time travel has been developed and into the hands of a team of young screw-ups called ""loopers"" to do the killing. Why loopers? Because sooner or later these live-in-the-moment assassins will wind up killing their time-displaced selves -- or ""closing the loop."" Theyre rewarded handsomely and life is sweet until ... well until time travel is invented and they get booted back to face the barrel of their own blunderbusses. You dont have to be Albert Einstein to know that sending assassins back to the past is a bad idea -- not for a movie but as a system of gangland garbage disposal. Kick your unwanted trash into the future and youre rid of it but blast a career killer back in time and theres a pretty strong chance the death-marked assassin will irrevocably alter the ""future"" from which he came if he can manage to escape. That loophole big enough to drive a plot through is precisely what makes Johnsons crazy idea work. Joe played by Gordon-Levitt with pale blue contacts puffy lips and a fake schnozz that takes some getting used to is pretty unconflicted about killing strangers from the future himself included. But when Older Joe arrives in the form of grizzled action star Willis his 30-years-younger self flinches just long enough for the guy to make his move knocking Joe unconscious before disappearing into his own past. Now heres where things get fun for the kind of sci-fi crowd that likes to diagram and debate the logic of time-travel stories. Youd think that Older Joe has the upper hand able to anticipate the way his younger self reacted but as cat-and-mouse games go the young punk has a distinct advantage since the slightest injury to Gordon-Levitts body travels forward to appear as scar tissue on Willis. The pic demonstrates just how this works with Joes sidekick Seth (Paul Dano). After purposefully allowing his older self to escape (or ""letting his loop run"" in the parlance) Seth hides out at Joes place -- not a smart idea considering that Joe prizes money over friendship and doesnt put up much resistance before surrending Seth to the syndicate chief (Jeff Daniels whose blood runs cold behind a bearded smile). What follows is a truly disturbing death scene as Seths loop (Frank Brennan) tries to hop the nearest train only to see 30-year-old injuries start to appear all over his body the result of the younger Seth being sadistically tortured offscreen. Kill the kid and his loop goes too -- a rule that puts Older Joe in the awkward position of simultaneously having to run from and protect his younger self. Trickier from a storytelling standpoint is the fact that auds dont meet Willis until the first-act break at which point the film must rapidly supply a romantic backstory for a character who in the present reality technically does not yet exist. So while Gordon-Levitts Joe is a heartless hustler Willis older-and-wiser counterpart brings soul to the character having discovered -- and had to watch die -- the love of his life. Willis can play the tough guy in his sleep but its the characters tenderness that makes possible the ruthlessness with which he sets about trying to change his own fate. Thirty years after the story takes place a mysterious figure called ""the Rainmaker"" has risen to power and in classic ""Terminator"" fashion Older Joe has the rare chance to strangle the monster in his crib. His only clues are the kids birthdate and mythology They say he has a synthetic jaw and that he watched his mom die. While Willis single-mindedly begins to hunt down and execute 10-year-olds Gordon-Levitt tracks down a lead that points him toward an isolated Kansas farmhouse where Sara (Emily Blunt stunning enough to suggest a new future for Joe) and son Cid (Pierce Gagnon) have cut themselves off from modern society leading to the inevitable confrontation between the two Joes -- and a twist that not only rewards the intricate character work of the pics laggy middle hour but beautifully ties everything together. Complicated as it all sounds Johnson paves the way with wall-to-wall voiceover. As in ""Brick"" the scripts well-tooled lines are stilted enough to sound cool and angled in the direction of comedy relying on expressions less suggestive of a sci-fi future than they are of vintage film noir. Face-to-face with himself young Joe hisses ""Why dont you do what old men do and die?"" For both thesps the challenging roles amount to playing near-nihilism while also subtly absorbing one anothers characteristics. The two actors look nothing alike of course which wouldnt be a big deal if Johnson hadnt tried so hard to force a resemblance burying Gordon-Levitts striking mug under prosthetics (the most distracting being an application meant to simulate Willis unique beak) instead of simply trusting auds to care enough about Joe to see past the differences. Still Johnson steps up to the pics practical challenges nicely balancing high-caliber action with intricate character work. The support team leverages Louisiana to suggest a 30-year-distant Kansas (and Shanghai for locations 30 years farther down the line) without requiring too many effects though the digital work looks convincing when needed. The loopers signature weapon essentially a sawed-off shotgun with a Steampunk twist is evocative of both past and future. If the imperfect yet promising ""Brick"" teased an exciting new voice then ""Looper"" suggests big things ahead.

TWITTER Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis go head-to-head in writer-director Rian Johnsons clever science fiction tale. Looper is a clever entertaining science fiction thriller that neatly blurs the line between suicide and murder. An existential conundrum wrapped in a narrowly conceived yarn about victims sent back in time to be bumped off by assassins called loopers Rian Johnsons third and most ambitious feature keeps the action popping while sustaining interest in the long arc of a story about a man assigned to kill the 30-years-older version of himself. A lively high-profile choice to open this years Toronto International Film Festival this Sony release co-starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the same role should chalk up sizable returns in the wake of its Sept. 28 theatrical bow. VIDEO Looper Star Joseph Gordon-Levitt on Getting Kicked in the Head by Bruce Willis Probably the shakiest aspect of Johnsons original screenplay is what it asks the viewer to buy about the future A mere 62 years from now in 2074 time travel has become possible but such a momentous breakthrough is limited to serving as a body-disposal system. Under the prevailing authority time jumping is strictly outlawed because of its potential for messing with history. A large criminal mob run by an overlord called The Rainmaker defiantly uses it but only as a vehicle for assassination with ""loopers"" -- disreputable gunmen living in 2044 -- laying in wait for people to execute so no bodies or other evidence can be found in the future. But the premise is established in nifty fashion; the doomed hooded with hands bound behind them suddenly materialize in an empty field and the looper immediately blows him away with his blunderbuss. One such executioner is Joe (Gordon-Levitt) a retro-looking hipster who drives a very old red Miata and wears ties ""a 20th century affectation"" that offends his crankily genial boss Abe (Jeff Daniels). If he can get out of this racket he says hed like to go to France which earns him further scorn from the older man; ""Im from the future you should go to China"" he scolds. PHOTOS Movies With Different Actors in the Same Role Backed by a cynically confessional voice-over track from Joe that is not as self-consciously hardboiled as the commentary Gordon-Levitt read for Johnson in Brick seven years ago Looper mostly is set in a seedy metropolis that doesnt look all that different from sketchy neighborhoods in some big cities today; there are derelicts bombed-out buildings ruined cars and enough other signs of urban ills to suggest that in Johnsons view things will just gradually decline over the next three decades. Joe hangs out in clubs sees a sexy woman (Piper Perabo) who works in one of them and tries to help a friend and fellow looper Seth (Paul Dano) whos imminently endangered by a new development thats come down from on high Theyre ""closing all the loops"" meaning theyre sending the ""future selves"" of all the loopers back to be killed. Almost immediately Joe is in the same jam. When a half-hour into the film he goes to the field to do his next job the guy who pops up to be shot is not hooded. Joes hesitation allows the older man to escape and its clear who he is Its Joe as his older self. And for his failure to kill him young Joe is in a pile of trouble with Abe and his ""gats"" first-class hired guns. STORY Looper Interactive Trailer Reveals New Interviews Behind-the-Scenes Footage When the two Joes finally sit down -- across from each other in a diner in the middle of nowhere -- theres no doubt theyre working at cross purposes Young Joe is determined to kill his older self while old Joe is dead set on tracking down and taking out The Rainmaker who would be a little kid in 2044 so his late wife wont die at his hands after all. The biggest problem facing the makers of Looper is how to make the audience believe that the trim long-faced Gordon-Levitt could somehow change so much in 30 years that he would look like the thicker-built and shorter-nosed Willis. The solution lay in altering the younger actors appearance imperceptibly at first but gradually to morph his dark eyes into Willis gray-green and to reshape his nose and eyebrows either with makeup or digitally or perhaps both. At first the effect is a bit odd and you cant quite put your finger on whats off; then it feels downright weird to be looking at a version of Gordon-Levitt who is no longer the actor youve known for a few years now. This is especially noticeable during the films second half much of which takes place at young Joes place of refuge the isolated home of feisty young farmer and single mom Sara (Emily Blunt) who has an unusually gifted son Cid (Pierce Gagnon). Even as the temperature is kept at a low simmer the films pace deliberately is slowed here to develop some intimacy between these two isolated people and give some screen time to the kid who pretty obviously will provide the reason for old Joe to eventually head for the farm. The eventual ending is great the resolution to the tricky time maneuvering very impressively worked out. VIDEO Looper Trailer Puts Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a Tough Spot Killing Bruce Willis Shot mostly in Louisiana with a bit done in Shanghai the film looks tightly made on a budget but sacrifices nothing for that; the world depicted looks dirty dangerous and ramshackle with a few high-tech touches here and there. Their physical disparity notwithstanding Gordon-Levitt and Willis both come across strongly while Blunt effectively reveals Saras tough and vulnerable sides. Daniels is particularly amusing as the garrulous old enforcer holding down the futures outpost in the past.
