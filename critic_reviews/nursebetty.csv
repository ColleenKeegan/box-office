More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

A terrific Renee Zellweger heads a superlative cast that includes Morgan Freeman Chris Rock and in his liveliest performance to date Greg Kinnear. In the darkly comic ""Nurse Betty"" his third and most accomplished picture Neil LaBute puts aside the intense explorations of misogyny that dominated his earlier films (""In the Company of Men"" ""Your Friends amp; Neighbors"") and immerses himself in a lighter romantic fable that deals with the collision of fantasy and reality. As a small-town waitress stuck in a bad marriage but determined to make her dreams come true a terrific Renee Zellweger heads a superlative cast that includes Morgan Freeman Chris Rock and in his liveliest performance to date Greg Kinnear. With the right marketing and handling USA release can score big with a clever vastly entertaining film that should go way beyond the small indie auds of LaButes previous efforts. Changing pace and choosing the kind of fare he would appear unlikely to direct proves a smart career move by LaBute whose first two films suffered from a static theatrical quality. ""Nurse Betty"" arrives at a time when critics had begun to suspect that LaBute may be more a provocative writer interested in shock strategies and the theater of cruelty than a filmmaker capable of telling a story in a visually satisfying manner. New picture demonstrates a quantum leap forward for LaBute as a helmer in command of film grammar a feat achieved with the undeniable help of ace French lenser Jean Yves Escoffier. Working for the first time with a script he didnt write LaBute shows good instincts in turning John C. Richards and James Flambergs yarn about the intricate link between art and life into a rousing enterprise set largely outdoors (also a first for LaBute). This road comedy perhaps inspired by ""The Wizard of Oz"" takes full advantage of its shifting locales and states of mind. First scene shows Kansas waitress Betty (Zellweger) more interested in the romantic shenanigans of the daytime soap ""A Reason to Love"" than in serving her customers. The popular TV show offers escape from her bleak reality; back home Betty has to endure the company of her no-good car salesman hubby Del (Aaron Eckhart) an abusive man who treats her like dirt. When he forgets her birthday and friend Sue Ann (Kathleen Wilhoite) is also busy Betty decides to celebrate the event alone quietly. One night while watching a tape of that days soap episode Betty hears her favorite character Dr. David Ravell stare at the moon and say ""I know theres someone special out there for me."" Its a line that touches a deep chord -- she repeats it over and over again -- and provides the stimulus to what turns out to be a life-changing experience. Opportunity knocks when a drug deal between Del and two hit men Charlie (Morgan Freeman) and his easily excitable protege Wesley (Chris Rock) goes horrendously fatally awry. When Dels dumb racist remarks about Native Americans irritate the duo he winds up on the wrong end of a gun in a gratuitous violent scene that recalls the Coen brothers movies. Traumatized by the savagery that shes accidentally witnessed Betty chooses the path taken by Mia Farrows victimized housewife in Woody Allens Depression-era fable ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" entering a kind of alternate reality. Assuming the soaps persona of Nurse Betty shes set on returning to the love of her life Dr. Ravell whom she jilted at the altar six years ago. Betty leaves Kansas in a borrowed 1997 Buick failing to realize that it contains the stuff her husbands killers are looking for. Her mind is intensely focused on what she perceives as her calling and mission a reunion with Ravell. Rest of tale is conveyed through cross-cutting between Bettys personal adventures and the duo of killers chasing her. Shrewd script offers amusing variations on the familiar screen types of hit men. Bickering in the manner of Oscar and Felix Charlie and Wesley engage in wildly differing assessments of their prey Wesley sees her as a coldly calculating bitch while Charlie begins to fantasize and obsess about her. In a masterful scene set in the Grand Canyon at night the courtly Charlie sees himself dancing with Betty. What keeps the sagas engines going is a thick plot with countless twists and turns. Scripters seem intrigued by couples offering up at least half a dozen of them. Betty bonds with a warm and friendly Latina Rosa (Tia Texada) after saving latters brother from death in a shooting accident; then theres the duo of sheriff Ballard (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and reporter Roy (Crispin Glover) who are also following Betty. Centerpiece and what gives pic its heart is the encounter between Betty and yet another couple George McCord (Kinnear) who plays Dr. Ravell and his acidic writer-producer Lyla (Allison Janney). Mesmerized by her very presence George thinks that Betty would like to get a part in his soap only to realize that shes after something bigger than that. As pic explores in many variations the question of whether life imitates art or vice versa the lines between fantasy and reality blur. LaBute has always coaxed terrific performances from his casts but here he does an especially outstanding job of letting each thesp in the large ensemble shine. Few actresses can convey the kind of honesty and humanity that Zellweger does here -- its hard to imagine the film without her dominant thoroughly credible performance. Theres wonderful chemistry between Freeman and Rock as the killers. Former demonstrates yet again that hes a brilliant actor who can bring nobility to any part he plays while Rock proves a good foil. Kinnear has done good work before but he has never come across with such effortless appeal. A dizzying array of secondary performers all playing succinctly drawn characters gives the movie a frenzied funny texture. Janney who has some of the wittiest one-liners is perfect as the producer and Texada is sexy and enticing. Other small roles that come to vivid life include that of Eckhart (LaButes quintessential actor having appeared in all his pics) Vince as the sheriff and Glover as the intense writer. Unlike LaButes previous films which were intimate and abstractly set in unnamed cities ""Nurse Betty"" benefits from a large-scale scheme and specific locales. Tech credits are good across the board particularly Escoffiers widescreen lensing which is impeccably filled with inventive often mesmerizing compositions.

Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock play a pair of hit men who follow Sizemore to California after murdering her husband. GOOD MEDICINE / Winsome Renee Zellweger leads an outstanding cast in the twisted comedy `Nurse Betty 1 / 2 Back to Gallery NURSE BETTY Comedy. Starring Renee Zellweger Morgan Freeman Chris Rock and Greg Kinnear. Directed by Neil LaBute. Written by John C. Richards and James Flamberg. (R. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) When Bettys husband is murdered by two hit men she doesnt react the way we think she will. A few tears briefly but once the police arrive shes chipper and bubbly and ready to hit the road. ""Thanks for stopping by"" she tells the cops as if theyd dropped in for coffee and Twinkies. So begins ""Nurse Betty"" a wonderfully twisted comedy from Neil LaBute. Starring Renee Zellweger as Betty Sizemore a Kansas waitress who suffers a delusional fugue following her husbands murder this is the most original unexpected film of the year. After a summer of brain-numbing junk ""Nurse Betty"" seems like a reprieve. Its especially surprising coming from LaBute the Utah-reared director whose first two films ""In the Company of Men"" and ""Your Friends amp; Neighbors"" were so bitter and scabrous that one would never guess he had the capacity for a sweet lighthearted fable. ""Nurse Betty"" wasnt written by LaBute but by John C. Richards and James Flamberg who shared the screenplay award at this years Cannes Film Festival. Part satire part road movie part cops-and-robbers yarn its also a fairy tale about a woman who disassociates from reality and takes a bizarre journey -- far from the home she knows and into her own heart. There are references to Dorothy in ""The Wizard of Oz"" throughout ""Nurse Betty"" -- and who better to conjure the prairie child in gingham and pigtails than Renee Zellweger? With her round face her soft flutey voice and lost-lamb demeanor Zellweger is letter-perfect. And a likely Oscar contender. Once Betty enters a delusional state she gets in a 1997 Buick LeSabre and drives to California to hook up with heart surgeon Dr. David Ravell. It doesnt matter that Ravell is a character on her favorite soap ""A Reason to Love"" and is played by arrogant actor George McCord (Greg Kinnear). Bettys convinced that Dr. David is her former fiance and wants so badly to reconnect that she poses as a nurse in the hospital where she thinks hes on staff. When she meets McCord by crashing a showbiz gala and pours on the Midwestern honey he thinks shes auditioning for a part on the soap. LaBute performs a delicate balancing act here mixing a tone of daffy sweetness with occasional violence different levels of reality and a parallel plot involving the hit men -- one wise and close to retirement the other a pent-up hothead -- who offed Bettys husband. Expertly played by Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock these guys are hot for Bettys LeSabre and its contents but their function in the film is more comic than threatening. During the trip across country Freeman develops a crush on his quarry while Rock disgusted by cheap sentiment wants only to eliminate her. Rock with his wild-man eyes and explosive delivery is incapable of a dull line reading and gets the biggest laughs. When Freeman wants to stop at the Grand Canyon for a nature moment Rock crunches up his face in disgust ""Aint nothin but a hole in the ground S-- aint grand its bland."" The actors in ""Nurse Betty"" are all terrific including Aaron Eckhart a staple of LaButes films as Bettys dirt-bag husband Allison Janney as the producer of the soap that stars Kinnear Pruitt Taylor Vance as the doofus sheriff from Bettys Kansas hometown Crispin Glover as a hapless investigative reporter and Tia Texada as a lovelorn woman who encourages Bettys pursuit of Dr. David. Kudos to all and especially to the adorable and skillful Zellweger. In an era when actors all seem to be experts in the art of withering sarcasm a performer who emanates kindness and a pure heart is worth celebrating. -- Advisory This movie contains violence and harsh language. ..

Richards; Producer (group) Gramercy Pictures; Release Date Wide 09/08/2000; Runtime (in minutes) 110; MPAA Rating R; Distributor USA Films Posted September 8 2000 -- 1200 AM EDT The skeptics rap on Neil LaBute is that hes a master of dramatizing the casual savagery in mens souls but jeez already. Its not my rap Im just saying The writer and director of In the Company of Men Your Friends amp; Neighbors and Bash is known and sometimes bashed for creating characters whose blandness cant mask their biliousness and for caging those characters in claustrophobically generic settings -- an office cubicle a hotel room -- without a prayer of ever seeing the metaphoric or actual light. The dare has been this Could LaBute handle space and movement and specificity and a story not of his own (obsessive) construction? The answer is Oh my yes Nurse Betty which he directed from a screenplay by John C. Richards and James Flamberg is unclaustrophobically one of the best movies of the year -- a leap of storytelling as joyously fluid as In the Company of Men is intentionally constricted. Its one of those exciting experiences that restimulates an appetite for the medium after a summer of swallowing tasteless predictable pap. Of course the problem with selling such a tangy flavor -- especially from so famously dyspeptic a vendor as LaBute -- is that the movie eludes the usual store-bought product categories. As with such one-of-a-kinds as Election Rushmore or Go before it Nurse Betty doesnt fare well in trailers or ads. Seeing 30 seconds of Renee Zellwegers muffin-fresh face in a commercial or watching a moment of her creeping behind cars clutching a cardboard cutout of Greg Kinnear gives no sense of the springiness and focus of Zellwegers performance -- her best far expanding her charms in Jerry Maguire -- or of Kinnears dancerly skill at playing a soap opera actor playing a doctor. Indeed theres no way to encapsulate the bigness of heart with which Nurse Betty expands to embrace creation as majestically real as the Grand Canyon as powerfully fake as TV. Anyway Zellwegers Betty isnt even a nurse. Shes a coffee-shop waitress in Fair Oaks Kan. the wife of a philandering and abusive car salesman (played by Aaron Eckhart LaButes reliable muse when it comes to piggish manhood). Betty escapes her domestic prison through an addiction to A Reason to Love a daytime soap opera starring George McCord (Kinnear) as dashing Dr. David Ravell. And shes curled up alone in the den one night watching a tape of the days episode (""I know theres someone special out there for me"" the dreamboat doc sighs) when her husband stumbles back home with two strangers unaware that Bettys in the house and proceeds to fumble a shady business deal. The elegant older gent Charlie (Morgan Freeman) becomes angry; the younger more apoplectic Wesley (Chris Rock) goes ballistic. Surreptitiously witnessing the horrifying melee Betty copes by disappearing into a fugue state She transforms herself -- we watch it in Zellwegers crinkly eyes -- becoming another woman Nurse Betty for whom Dr. Ravell is she knows her someone special. And she calmly sets out for the fictitious ""Loma Vista Hospital"" in California to find him with the brutal enforcers Charlie and Wesley on her trail.
