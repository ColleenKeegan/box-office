Sandra Bullock (below) is ball-busting New York publishing editor Margaret Tate whose sadistic way with her colleagues shows up both her utter wretchedness as a human being and the inherent inequalities of American employment law. Ryan Reynolds plays her nice-guy assistant Andrew Paxton happy to accept her exploitative manner in the hope that it may lead to his eventual promotion. Yet Margaret is Canadian and due to a foul-up at the immigration department the threat of deportation looms if she is unable to prove to Homeland Security that shes married to a Yank. Knowing that Andrews good for it she coerces him to pose as her husband and in order to reinforce the deception the pair head to the scenic Alaskan heartlands for Grammy Paxtons ninetieth. Despite sporadically amusing performances from the two leads this ticks all the same boxes as films like Green Card Meet the Parents and The Devil Wears Prada including a perpetuation of the myth that inside every ruthless independently minded businesswoman lies a fragile fawn just waiting to be drawn out by some buff liberal drone. And what with this unfolding in Sarah Palin country were also reminded that marriage is not something to be used to circumvent justice but a cherished gift from God. Also the much-touted nude scene in which Reynolds and Bullock readily engage in a game of full-frontal blind mans buff is about as sexy (and not to mention plausible) as Babs Windsors catapulting bikini top in Carry on Camping.

But we were soon delighted to find it was very good indeed. Sandra Bullock and her opposite number play very well against each other and the landcape of Alaska in summer was enchanting. Of course there was going to be a happy ending - what else dyou expect? - but there were many unexpected twists It was a thoroughly intelligent film never unpleasant or over-sexy and the nude scene was genuinely funny and not at all out of place. The whole case was excellent and there were some genuinely touching moments.

The only thing wrong with the nude scene is that its too short and we dont see enough of Ms Bullock who at 44 even allowing for Hollywood lighting looks terrific and adds credibility to a storyline in which the male lead is considerably younger. . .. Moreover the film has a subtlety which has by-passed a lot of the cynical critics who hate to see the continued success of this mainstream American actress . . .. . whose performances manage to save whateveer film she s in . . . eg Hope Floats where she gives a terrific performance which almost saves the film from too much American sentiment. The Proposal is a similar vehicle . . but more successful in terms of avoiding the `gush` factor. The Alaskan setting helps to earth the film in terms of realism and like Pride and Prejudice the romantic heroine starts to fall for the romantic lead when she finds out how rich he is . . .. although as in Pride and Prejudice this is ironic rather than an accurate statement on the characters integrity. For me the film has more in common with Jane Austens classic than it does with any `Carry on Film` . The Proposal is by no means an entirely satisfying film but it deserves more praise from the critics than it is getting.It was interesting to learn that Quentin Tarantino liked it.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 25 2009JennyFeaturedI took three fourteen year old boys and my ten year old daughter along with me to see this on a rainy afternoon and the cinema was full. I havent been to a film in a long time when there were so many people men women and children laughing out loud in film. Ignore the cynical critics - yes of course we know the film is a variation on a well used theme but this one is a superior romantic comedy and both leads act really well and have chemistry between them. I would thoroughly recommend this film - its a real tonic with genuine laugh out loud moments but also real pathos - I admit that at one point I cried.. Definitely recommended.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyJul 23 2009CarolineFeaturedHIGHLY recommended. Best romcom of 2009 so far. Sandra Bullock is at her comic best.

The two leads are credible as there is such good chemistry between them. The film well acted humourous and their are tender parts that had practically the entire audience sniffling away.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 19 2009 Save for later Saved Ryan Reynolds left and Sandra Bullock are shown in a scene from The Proposal. Kerry Hayes/Touchstone Pictures/AP           View Caption About video ads View Caption of Every once in a while - too often these days - a movie from a major studio comes out that makes you wish there was a federally funded quality control review board in Hollywood. The monumentally unfunny ""Land of the Lost"" was bad enough. Now theres the monumentally unromantic ""The Proposal"" a dud of a different sort. Instead of being about dinosaurs and time warps its about gags that were old when dinosaurs ruled the earth.Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate a martinet New York book editor whose underlings quake in fear of her. (Im beginning to regret ""The Devil Wears Prada"" ever got made.) Ryan Reynolds is Andrew Paxton her all-purpose and much-abused assistant who puts up with her because he wants to be an editor himself. (Like I said Im regretting the existence of ""The Devil Wears Prada."") By a twist of fate and bad screenwriting Margaret a Canadian citizen must marry Andrew in order to remain in America. He agrees to the arrangement because he thinks it will get him an editors job.To make the impending nuptials look good to the Immigration Service personified by an agent (Denis OHare) who could give Jabert in ""Les Miserables"" a run for his money the two nonlovebirds fly to Andrews homestead in Sitka Alaska. His family is wealthy but he wants no part of their money. He wants to make his mark in New York where presumably he has found a one-bedroom apartment to rent for under 3000 a month. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Do you need to be told that good guy careerist Andrew and steely Margaret who arrives in Sitka in high heels eventually come to cuddles? (""The Devil Wears High Heels""?) This is the kind of movie where the lead characters are always wisecracking to hide their pain - that is when theyre not accidentally bumping into each other naked or opening up about why they got that strategically placed tattoo. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Betty White the only good part of the movie The Proposal As Andrews grandmother Betty White steals the movie except Im not sure shed take that as a compliment. After all if you steal something thats worth nothing what does that make you? Grade D- (Rated PG-13 for sexual content nudity and language.)

Should The Proposal be an I dont? Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 18 2009 320 PM facebook Tweet email Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds star in The Proposal. (Touchstone Pictures) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday June 18 2009 320 PM Title The Proposal If every relationship is built on shared interests its easy to see why Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds would pair off. After all they have at least two major things in common theyre both unusually likable leading actors and they both have unusually awful taste in movies. Reynolds at least has finally started heading in the right direction after years of choosing scripts painfully beneath him. So it would have been nice if these two had found something worthy of their combined talents. Instead their mutual inclination towards synthetic Hollywood junk just drags them down together. One of those mean-spirited romantic comedies that takes strange pleasure in despising its own heroine ""The Proposal"" mashes the infinitely superior ""Devil Wears Prada"" with ""What Happens in Vegas"" with about a million other movies to have fallen off the assembly line in recent decades. Bullock is Margaret the uptight Manhattan editor variously described as a witch a monster and a terrorist. Reynolds is her assistant Andrew who is as cute and smart and snarky as well Ryan Reynolds. When the Canadian-born Margaret finds herself threatened with deportation she blackmails Andrew into marriage. To appease a suspicious immigration rep (Denis OHare) they head to Andrews Alaskan hometown to make things official. Naturally his parents (Mary Steenburgen Craig T. Nelson) are stunned to find their level-headed son marrying his evil big-city boss. But you know how it goes when opposites attract. And really you do. Theres the awkward kiss that turns out to be pretty great. The bickering that loses its bite. The matchmaking sex-obsessed grandma (Betty White making enough of her silly role to remind us why shes a national treasure). And so on until the inevitable finale. Its impossible to guess why Bullock was ever attracted to this insulting role and the eternally confident Reynolds is miscast as a young bullied underling. Still there is a spark between them and all the actors are good enough to keep things watchable--even if we never feel fully engaged.

Chemistry counts for a lot in this kind of movie and Sandra Bullocks first rom-com in seven years -- with her first nude scene ever -- provides her with an ideal sparring partner in Ryan Reynolds. PHOTOS 50 Romantic Comedy Couples We Love MOVIE BLOG Get the latest film news Hes a big improvement over the diffident Hugh Grant who led Bullock to swear off the genre after their teaming in ""Two Weeks Notice."" Bullock is Margaret the book-publisher boss from hell (think ""The Devil Wears Prada"") and hes Andrew her long-suffering assistant of three years who dubs her ""The Devils Mistress"" in one of his kinder moments. Margaret who needs to avoid being deported to her native Canada because of one of those technicalities so beloved by screenwriters (see ""Green Card"") blackmails the unwilling Andrew into marrying her so she can stay in the country. If he doesnt shell blacklist the aspiring editor in the publishing industry. To convince a highly skeptical immigration agent (Denis OHare) the faux couple fly together to his hometown in Alaska (ably impersonated by Massachusetts) for a family celebration of his grandmothers 90th birthday. Margarets fish-out-of-water adventures -- including awkward encounters with a male stripper an overly enthusiastic puppy and a cellphone-grabbing hawk -- are as predictable as what happens when she and Andrew try to deceive his family. And Margaret a careerist who admits to not having slept with a man in two years is of course forced to re-examine her priorities. Andrew it must be admitted thaws the boss -- their 12-year age difference mentioned only in one joke -- in an entirely agreeable manner. Such as an expertly staged accidental (tasteful) nude grappling that demonstrates once again not only is Bullock an able physical comedian shes in terrific shape for a 44-year-old. Reynolds who actually is a Canadian in real life (and Scarlett Johanssons husband to boot) gives his first bona fide movie star performance after efforts in a variety of ill-suiting genres matching Bullocks expertise in the rom-com genre quip for quip. The meatiest supporting role goes to veteran scene-stealer Betty White as Andrews grandmother who in the funniest scene has difficulty locating Margarets breasts while fitting the reluctant bride for a wedding dress. Dont be surprised if she gets an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. Craig T. Nelson has less to do as Andrews disapproving father who smells a rat in Margaret and Mary Steenburgen is basically wasted as his mother. The boss asked if I enjoyed ""The Proposal."" As a longtime Bullock fan I guess the answer is yes but Im calling it a guilty pleasure. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next THE NARROWS Read Next THE NARROWS Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 45485 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 25403 College student kills 3 in house party shooting cops 15231 Braves Brian McCann interest may pave way for Gary Sanchez Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

""The Proposal"" Movie Review -- Something old nothing new something borrowed something -- blah. Thats not exactly the way the tradition is supposed to go for a wedding. But thats the recipe for the ""The Proposal"" a mostly harmless completely unsurprising romantic comedy arriving in theaters Friday. The Proposal (PG-13) Touchstone (102 min.) Directed by Anne Fletcher. With Sandra Bullock Ryan Reynolds. Now playing in New Jersey. STEPHEN WHITTYS RATING TWO STARS Rating note The film contains sexual situations and a few strong words. Sandra Bullock who hasnt been in a comedy since 2005s ""Miss Congeniality 2"" (and really not even then) plays a hard-charging New York book editor. The always slightly surprised-looking Ryan Reynolds is her much put-upon assistant. When Bullocks heroine - a Canadian - discovers shes in trouble with U.S. immigration her only quick-fix answer is to find someone to marry. So in addition to fetching her latte her assistant is told to fetch her a wedding ring. And slip it on her finger post-haste. This is basically ""Green Card"" crossed with ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and dont think it wasnt pitched precisely that way at the studio meeting. Admittedly as a basic plotline it works. But so does a machine. And ""The Proposal"" is just as dully predictable as one. Theres a trip back to a corny small town so the career girl can be put in her place (see ""New in Town"") tacky celebrations with his family (see ""My Best Friends Wedding"") an embarrassing bachelorette party (see ""Bride Wars"") and a sudden breakup for all the wrong reasons (see ""What Happens in Vegas""). And then theres -- no surprise -- a happy ending that includes a sudden realization a chase a heartfelt apology and a public embrace while a gathering crowd oohs and ahs (see almost any other romantic comedy from the last 30 years.) No I mean that. Please -- see almost any other romantic comedy from the last 30 years. Actually ""The Proposal"" has a few things going for it. One is -- despite the sleazy ease of most PG-13 movies now -- a reluctance to go for the cheapest joke. Another is the cast which in addition to Bullock and Reynolds features Oscar Nunez from ""The Office"" working very hard as a local romeo and Betty White still gamely going for gags as Reynolds 90-year-old grandmother. There isnt much to Bullocks character - shes all heartless ambition until shes not -- and even less to Reynolds. The script gropes pretty desperately for laughs at times (including a scene with White out in the woods worshipping the old Inuit gods) and director Anne Fletcher - whose ""27 Dresses"" at least had a few nicely edited visual sequences - is merely workmanlike. To her credit though ""The Proposal"" limits itself to a single crack about Bullocks age (usually when an actress is paired with a co-star 12 years her junior shes called ""a cougar""; when the equation is reversed of course its called business as usual). And thats at least a small step forward. Perhaps unnoticed though at least at this preview. ""How old is Sandra Bullock anyway?"" a man asked somewhat argumentatively after the screening ended. (Um 45 next month.) ""She lost a LOT of weight"" a woman said darkly on the escalator. (Er not sure -- but she looks good particularly in her one comic and pretty discreet nude scene.) What I was thinking actually after the movie ended was how nice it was simply to see Bullock -- an ever-amiable and accessible actress -- in a comedy again. But what people were mostly talking about -- well that shows just how little this particular comedy connected. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds star in The Proposal. Photo Kerry Hayes  Touchstone Pictures The Proposal 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Proposals premise is as old as the hills. Man and woman despise each other until they dont. Man and woman bicker until they kiss. Man and woman enact scenes of romantic-comic tension while violins pluck bemusedly on the soundtrack -- until the big emotional reveal attended by sniffling piano. All the same man and woman could be worse. The man could be played by someone other than the pliable reliable Ryan Reynolds who seems equally at ease in muscle-bound action turns (X-Men Origins Wolverine) brainiac head-scratchers (The Nines) and wistful romantic comedy (Definitely Maybe). Hes a fine choice to play the aggrieved assistant -- and unwilling fiance -- of a she-devil Manhattan book editor at risk of being deported to Canada. Drew (Reynolds) becomes engaged to Margaret (Sandra Bullock) right after she learns of her crumbling legal status. Margaret objects loudly (""Its not like Im even an immigrant -- Im from Canada ... "") but her visa is lapsed. Worse the guy replacing her is a suck-up do-nothing she fired moments before. Then Drew walks in a shining vision of legal American citizenship. Margaret sidles up purposefully pats his power-red tie and announces ""Were getting married"" -- news that sparks mute terror on Reynolds shell-shocked face. At first Drew objects to this arrangement but the choice between marriage to a vicious harpy and a vaporized career prompts him to change his mind. The pair whoosh off for a long weekend in Alaska with Drews wealthy parents (Mary Steenburgen Craig T. Nelson) and adorably feisty grandma (Betty White but of course) who chants in a red-feathered headdress while a hip-hopping Margaret grinds to the beat. The Proposalwas written by Peter Chiarelli and helmed by27 Dresses director Anne Fletcher with a foursquare (OK bland) approach that nevertheless gives her romantic leads lots of comic face-time and room to mug disarmingly. They have a believable likable chemistry between them -- a real zing -- that offsets the predictability of everything that happens. It isnt a film with a lot of big guffaws but I smiled through most of it. On the other hand it could have done without the serial misuse of The Offices Oscar Nunez as Ramon a waiter/exotic dancer/store manager/minister who ups the yuck factor with the worlds most revolting striptease. He accounts for most of the scripts worst cliches. The rest are mild enough including one pallid joke about the leading ladys age. (She has 12 years on Reynolds the actual Canadian in the group.) Fans will be relieved to hear that her new movie represents some improvement over her last one the unconscionably dull Premonition. She begins The Proposal in full Devil Wears Prada mode whisking imperiously past cubicles while minions rush to placate her. But Bullock is neither Meryl Streep nor a convincing shrew; theres a reason shes been typecast as a decent plucky sort on runways and runaway buses. As Margaret peels away layers of witchiness the actor relaxes into her natural state and releases the mensch within woman behaves like ice-queen until she melts. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Bass Pro Shops Clearance Sale Deals from 1 + free shipping w/...

Strategic nudity. But the chemistry actually sizzles Add to ... Liam Lacey From Fridays Globe and Mail Published Thursday Jun. 18 2009 332PM EDT Last updated Monday Jun. 22 2009 510PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Proposal Directed by Anne Fletcher Written by Pete Chiarelli Starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds Classification PG Onscreen chemistry is an elusive notion but you know it when you see it and Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds definitely have it in The Proposal . Sharing a similar quality of strait-laced silliness with a knack for snappy banter the two stars invigorate this breezy trifle of a romantic comedy. More old than new definitely borrowed and just a little blue with some strategic nudity for comic effect The Proposal may be well-trod territory but worth a walk down the movie aisle. Bullock who hasnt had a blockbuster hit since 2002s Two Weeks Notice  plays Margaret Tate an aggressive Canadian editor (a welcome reversal of national stereotype) in a Manhattan publishing firm. Heartless ruthless and apparently sexless shes known as ""It"" by her terrorized employees. Her milquetoast personal assistant Andrew is played by Ryan Reynolds (a real-life Canadian) who hangs on to the job hoping that one day his novel will be accepted for publication. The poor drudge who fetches coffee interrupts meetings with fake calls and sheepishly endures her sarcasm finally faces a whole new level of insult. Margaret is pulled into her bosss office and told to settle her outstanding immigration issues promptly or shell be heading back to Toronto. Impulsively she announces that she and Andrew are in love and are planning to marry. If he doesnt come across she warns him hes out of a job along with her. Inspired by his new spousal status the worm begins to turn. Andrew recognizes he finally has some leverage and blackmails her back for a promotion. When it comes to the upcoming immigration test he knows everything about her (""allergies to pine nuts and the entire range of human emotions"") but shes vague about his life. As part of a crash course on his background to fool a zealous immigration official (Denis OHare) Margaret agrees to accompany him back to his hometown of Sitka Alaska for a family celebration. Thus the comedy conflates two romcom standbys The enemies who are forced to become allies and the one about the urban diva cast loose in the sticks. Anne Fletcher ( 27 Dresses ) moves things along well. Yes Bullocks character wears four-inch heels and too-tight skirts but there are some surprises - including an inspired bit of slapstick involving a dog an eagle and a cellphone. In place of the expected hicks and oddballs Andrews family are liberal thinkers who dwell in an ocean-side mansion. They include his doting mother (Mary Steenbergen) his domineering father (Craig T. Nelson) who wants Andrew to return to run the family business providing Andrew with a tender spot that melts Margarets heart. Also he looks good with his shirt off. Predictably as Margaret reveals her softer side and Andrew shows a caustic edge that makes him more attractive the couple move from faking love to the real thing. Theyre a sharp funny pair and - right up until the last scene some of Reynoldss lines are so well delivered youd think he wrote them himself. Be warned The Proposal is very much a case of for better and for worse. The stars charm barely sustains the movie through its lax last third. Andrews nosy big-hearted grandmother Betty White only 87 but playing 90 gets some crowd-pleasing scenes but is saddled with a questionable back story about her ""Indian"" roots. Popping up in all kinds of contexts is the towns mysterious Hispanic immigrant ( The Office s Oscar Nunez) in scenes that are more odd than funny. Theres also a complete loose end in the character of Gertrude (Malin Akerman who also appeared in Fletchers 27 Dresses ) as the sweet hometown girl that Andrew left behind to make it in the big city. The problem isnt that The Proposal is filled with cliches - what kind of romantic comedy would it be without them? - but like the perfect wedding its a question of getting the cliches exactly right.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post ""Satans Mistress"" wears Prada and a pair of Manolo stilts in ""The Proposal"" an all- too-familiar romantic comedy that nevertheless has a few just-as-familiar charms. Sandra Bullock is Margaret Tate. Do not call her Meg or Maggie -- or ""the witch"" as her office of cubicle-bound employees does via instant message. Top editor at a New York City book publisher shes the type who can wrangle a reclusive writer to agree to an Oprah book club appearance or lend a rival the right length of rope to hang himself. For all her canny efficiency the Canadian-born boss failed to order a minion to ensure that her work visa was in order. On the verge of being sent packing she pressures her overly dedicated assistant into a sham marriage. Take a letter darling -- and while youre at it get me a soy latte and an engagement ring. Winning Ryan Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton who sees an opportunity in Margarets dilemma. The movies tagline ""Here comes the bribe."" And the title speaks as much about business as marriage. An ambitious immigration officer (Denis OHare wasted as the bureaucrat) is no dope. And so the two must prove they are on the up and up. Shall we go on? Nah. Youd have to be visiting this planet for the first time not to guess where this tale is headed. In the near term the couple travels to Sitka Alaska (its actually Massachusetts). There Andrews disapproving dad (Craig T. Nelson) and mildly doting mom await their only childs return. Mary Steenburgen flashes the movies one honest moment when she chastises her husband. Grandma Annie sly matriarch of this clan of longtime and well-to-do Alaskans is played with goofy verve by Betty White. Malin Akerman (""The Watchmen"") plays the girlfriend Andrew left behind. Comedy is hard as they say. But deft romantic comedies have become durn near impossible (hence the rise of the bromance). Director Anne Fletcher who has gone from choreographer to dance-flick director (""Step Up"") to rom-comedy helmer (""27 Dresses"") doesnt get this story to tango and glide. As written by Pete Chiarelli Margaret is too armored. The iron-maiden boss character worked so well in ""Devil Wears Prada"" because Meryl Streeps character wasnt the one due for a transformation. And amiable Bullock can do mean so thats not the issue. She was impressive as a hardened wife in ""Crash."" But the script encases Margaret in rusted defenses from which it cant free her without awkward leaps and cheats. Still there are a couple of scenes that play well off each other. In one Margaret and Andrew tell his family and friends the utterly invented story of their engagement. Each interrupts the other building on the tale. The outcome is less an exquisite corpse than a Frankensteinian fib. In the other their competition gives way to confession. Shot from above the characters lie at a perpendicular angle. Shes on the bed; hes on the floor. Its an apt visual metaphor posing the question Will they ever move in tandem? For satisfying silliness theres a woodsy meeting where Grandma Annie and Margaret get their freak on. Reynolds made an engaging and intelligent romantic lead in the second-best romantic comedy of 2008 the under-attended ""Definitely Maybe."" (The best you ask? ""Ghost Town."") Here the handsome approachable actor who plays the cad well too (see ""Adventureland"") seems to have all the best lines. The truth is he just does so much more with them.

"The Proposal; Year One Two Canucks two formulas | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Proposal; Year One Two Canucks two formulasHidden within the swamp of Year One and the romantic jungle of The Proposal are springboards for rising Canadians Michael Cera and Ryan Reynolds.Michael Cera in Year One (left) and Ryan Reynolds in The Proposal.  (SUPPLIED PHOTOS)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 19 2009 Year One (out of 4) Starring Jack Black Michael Cera Oliver Platt Hank Azaria and David Cross. Directed by Harold Ramis. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The Proposal (out of 4) Starring Sandra Bullock Ryan Reynolds Betty White Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson. Directed by Anne Fletcher. 107 minutes. At major theatres. PG Hidden within the swamp of Year One and the romantic jungle of The Proposal are springboards for rising Canadians Michael Cera and Ryan Reynolds. But will the two actors bounce or bonk? Bramptons Cera (Juno Superbad) and Vancouvers Reynolds (X-Men Origins Wolverine) are on the brink of major stardom with recent hits having raised their profiles in Hollywood and beyond.Theyre being heavily promoted in their respective new comedies yet the attention they are getting is not without risk. Cera and Reynolds are essentially playing the same characters as always and theyre in films that rely heavily on formula. Stars can fall just as quickly as they rise.In Year One a ragged farce by the erratic Harold Ramis the geography is even shakier than the history. It begins in prehistoric jungles moves to biblical desert towns and metaphorically ends up in a bad Catskills nightclub.The jokes are so laden with groaners you almost expect to hear rim shots after every line. Its not long after the scene shifts bizarrely from caveman jungle to Old Testament sin city Sodom for example that somebody reworks the ""what happens in Vegas ..."" line - to scant amusement and zero surprise. And you can only begin to guess the riffage on the sodomy gags.On paper the teaming of the human apostrophe Jack Black with the man-child Cera as the films reluctant heroes seemed like a grand idea. As fur-clad Neanderthals Zed (Black) and Oh (Cera) they do make for an amusing couple of buddies in bad (old) times clinging to companionship after being exiled from their tribe for hunting incompetence and spiritual irreverence.They are lumbered by a script that seems to have drawn inspiration from Mike Myers 2008 turkey The Love Guru with its penile obsessions and lame religion-themed plot rather than Ramiss avowed influences of the historical comedies of Monty Python and Mel Brooks.This is yet another star-driven laugher the recent Land of the Lost being another prime example where it seems the actors went before the cameras without a finished screenplay hoping for ad-lib magic that never happened.There are so many leaps of logic - how could anyone simply walk from prehistoric times to biblical times? - you start wondering if producer Judd Apatow got a rental deal on leftover movie sets and just strung the ideas together.Ramis who has Ghostbusters Groundhog Day and Caddyshack in his ""win"" column co-wrote the screenplay with Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg of TVs The Office. The three know funny but their mirth meters need a tune-up. Were they afraid to go too far in lampooning Bible characters?They take the road too travelled by making Blacks Zed blustery and accident-prone and Ceras Oh timid and nerdy just as weve seen them many times before. Cameo shots from Apatow laugh factory toilers offer some novelty. Hank Azaria is great as Hebrew leader Abraham who invents circumcision but has a tough time selling the idea. An almost unrecognizable Bill Hader is great as a prehistoric soothsayer who has to explain to Zed what tribal exile means. And David Cross makes a fine Cain who has mixed emotions about knocking off his brother Abel (played by an uncredited Paul Rudd).Others are less enlivening. Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbads McLovin) is one short flat note as biblical son Isaac while Oliver Platt is a long homophobic drone as the queenly High Priest who demands frequent oil rubs. The female players - Olivia Wilde as a Sodom princess June Raphael and Juno Temple as Zeds and Ohs amorous interests - have to content themselves with being mainly eye candy.This latter concern isnt a problem for Sandra Bullock in The Proposal a screwball comedy where reverse sexism is at work. Shes the poor mans Meryl Streep in her role as Margaret Tate a New York book editor whose introduction tracks that of Streeps in The Devil Wears Prada right down to the ridiculously complicated Starbucks order delivered by her servile assistant. He refers to her as ""Satans mistress"" under his breath.The twist here is that the serf Andrew is played by Reynolds who normally does the hip cynic. Its an eye-opener to see him playing a pathetic pup one who heels to every cruel whim of his employer rather than the manoeuvring hound of his Van Wilder fame. The freshness doesnt last long though as The Proposal defaults to rom-com formula. Seems Margaret is an uppity Canadian - irony alert - whose U.S. resident status is about to be revoked by an overzealous immigration agent (Denis OHare).Margarets solution is a quickie engagement to Andrew who allows himself to be bullied into plans for a subsequent marriage of convenience. But his cojones grow back when a plot contrivance shifts the action to Alaska and the formula fun turns from screwball into fish-out-of-water. City slicker Margaret has to cope with the rural foibles of Andrews kooky kin including his meddling mom (Mary Steenburgen) gruff dad (Craig T. Nelson) and kinky granny (Betty White ever the scene thief) whose 90th birthday occasions the trip. Theyre hicks but also high rollers - ""Alaskan Kennedys"" as Margaret observes - and they have impulsive plans of their own for the presumed lovebirds in their midst.Nobody who ever attended a date movie will be surprised by what happens but The Proposal has low expectations and good vibes in its favour. Director Anne Fletcher (27 Dresses) never overplays her hand or the script by rookie scribe Peter Chiarelli. Bullock and Reynolds click both comedically and romantically making the most of their kid-friendly bedroom frolics. Its nice to see a movie where the leading ladys 12-year age gap over her younger leading man isnt an issue or even a plot point.So which Canuck gets the career boost from this weekends movie releases? Im betting Reynolds for giving us something at least a little stronger than the same old maple syrup.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"The Proposal engages when focus is on Bullock Reynolds - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs The Proposal engages when focus is on Bullock Reynolds Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge By Kerry Hayes Touchstone Pictures A match made in the workplace Ryan Reynolds is being forced to marry his boss (Sandra Bullock) who otherwise would be deported to her native Canada. ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Proposal  1/2 (out of four)Stars Sandra Bullock Ryan Reynolds Betty White Mary Steenburgen Craig T. Nelson Oscar NunezDirector Anne FletcherDistributor Disney Touchstone PicturesRating PG-13 for sexual content nudity and languageRunning time 1 hour 44 minutesOpens Friday nationwide WATCH THE TRAILER By Claudia Puig USA TODAY The appeal of a romantic comedy lies mostly in the chemistry between the starring lovebirds. In that regard The Proposal has what it takes. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds prove a likable duo. A veteran of the genre Bullock shows she still can be an endearing Americas sweetheart even if shes no longer quite the girl next door. Reynolds has the appropriate good looks easygoing charm and comic timing to be a natural in this setting. When the story trains its focus on their interactions things proceed swimmingly. But the film trips up in the second half when the humor becomes too broad and the scenarios become outlandish. Bullock plays the steely Margaret a witchy and heartless book editor with nary a shred of people skills. Reynolds plays Andrew her hardworking assistant. She overworks and abuses him and still he tirelessly plugs away. We later learn its not out of loyalty Hes determined to learn the business and has an overriding love for books. When a bureaucratic matter results in her impending deportation from the USA to her native Canada Margaret suddenly announces that she and Andrew are getting married which will allow her to remain in the country. Privately she threatens to fire him and destroy his future professional opportunities if he refuses. No dummy he extracts a promotion in the deal. They go off to Andrews family home in Alaska bound for his grandmothers (Betty White) birthday. The movie generally deteriorates getting bogged down in predictability and silliness. While Bullock and Reynolds are mired in animosity the laughs keep coming. Once they spend time together in a scenic remote locale get to know each other and develop an affection it becomes a familiar fish-out-of-water story that is only sporadically funny. As Bullock shows shes still adept at zany physical humor the film also showcases a nutty jack-of-all-trades played by Oscar Nunez (The Office). Though it falls short of winning our hearts completely The Proposal is a serviceable and intermittently funny romance made enjoyable by the sparks between Bullock and Reynolds.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Margaret Tate has it all a beautiful apartment in Central Park West a hot bod Prada bags and Louboutins and a high-velocity career as a New York City book editor. Oh and shes about to be deported. So what does the 40-something Margaret (Sandra Bullock) do to prevent being shipped kicking and screaming back to her native Canada? She proposes to her long-suffering assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) as a bribe If he marries her shell give him the promotion hes been drooling over since he started three years ago. It doesnt matter that the two bicker like Hepburn and Tracy; both are bound and determined to get what they want. But what starts out as a not-so-innocent little bribe becomes a whirlwind three-day trip to Andrews childhood home in an Alaskan island village where his parents and sassy grandma (Betty White) pull out all the stops to welcome the happy couple. Multitudes of the expected cringe-worthy familial high jinks occur and Margaret learns how to let down her hair -- literally. (Bye bye skintight ponytail A not-so-subtle character development device.) Directed by Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") ""The Proposal"" starts out fresh and clever but falls victim to the rom-coms tendency intentional or not to refuse to let a woman be defined by her career. Instead its only when she finds love (this time with a younger man -- ooh la la) that she can be complete. Its predictable fare but perhaps 50 percent smarter than Fletchers last attempt at a chick-pleaser. And though Bullock and Reynolds have snappy chemistry to spare their love affair stops just shy of being believable. There are too many awkward ""tender"" moments and not enough vigor for a real romance. White is the standout cracking up the audience as only a hyper-charming 87-year-old actress can do. Whether shes rubbing up to the towns only male stripper or dancing to Bullocks rendition of ""Get Low"" by Lil Jon while wearing a feathered headdress she steals every scene shes in. THE PROPOSAL  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 sexual content nudity and language. Though Bullock has never been impressive as an actress she creates a surprisingly likable leading lady while revealing more of the slapstick comedy chops she honed in ""Miss Congeniality"" even while naked. The screenwriters give Margaret a healthy dose of emotional growth and Bullock handles it gracefully resilient vs. tissue-sodden. Of course the jury is out as to whether Mr. Scarlett Johansson can act but Reynolds Andrew is wry and sarcastic as a stressed-out assistant-turned-groom can be. And dont fret of course he takes off his shirt -- you think a chick flick would be complete without that?

By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / June 19 2009 Email| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Casting a romantic comedy is like eating. Just because you like sardines and cheese doesnt mean you like them together. Sardines and cheese together is gross. As it turns out so is the pairing of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Individually his sarcasm can be amusing and her straining for comedy is occasionally funny. In ""The Proposal neither brings out anything good in the other and watching them try hurts the eyes the tummy and the libido. The nature of the genre regardless of how it begins ends with both parties in each others arms. And while I watched these two sets of lips (one set being a little fuller than I recall) head for collision I prayed the movie might fall off the assembly line and jostle loose the dreaded oncoming event. Ive rarely been less lucky. What is the opposite of fireworks? When two people kiss can firing squads go off?Bullock plays Margaret the type of high-powered New York book editor who sends an entire office running for cover when she comes to work. (""Its coming read the instant messages.) The movie had already lost me at that point since this is the kind of panic reserved for Faye Dunaway Glenn Close or Simon Cowell. In any case Margaret learns that shes being deported (shes from Toronto). Thinking quickly (someone mentions the words ""married and ""engaged) she informs her bosses that she and her unwitting unwilling assistant Andrew (Reynolds) are soon to be wed.Why a screenwriter would think hilarity would ensue from this premise is anybodys guess. Pete Chiarelli is that deeply uninspired screenwriter and he sends Margaret and Andrew to Sitka Alaska so they can break the news to his well-heeled family (Mary Steenburgen Craig T. Nelson and Betty White). Its a ridiculous distance to go just to produce a location that at least in this movie looks like it could be anywhere (in fact it was shot in and around Massachusetts). Sadly the closest we get to so-called local color is Oscar NuA+-ez as both the town Hispanic and the only person who works (from stripper to cashier to reverend he does it all).Reynolds gets to drop his considerable jaw arch his eyebrows and wrinkle his forehead always in disbelief. Bullock is back to doing her uptight shtick and here it made me laugh exactly once when she vamps around the woods singing Lil Jon amp; the Eastside Boyzs ""Get Low which is exactly what she has to do to make the comedy work here. She seems simultaneously too old for these low-calorie sitcoms and somehow still not experienced enough to pull them off. Meanwhile Whites vulgar-old-lady act is tired but funnier. (Is she the spryest 300-year-old on earth or what?)Directed by Anne Fletcher with the same pokiness she applied to ""27 Dresses the movie builds to a heavily advertised sequence in which Margaret and Andrew run into each other naked then peel themselves away in disgust. The physics involved is impressive. But how is an audience supposed to believe an hour later that love could possibly be in the air when one lovers sight of the others body provokes this kind of revulsion? Romantic comedies avoid sex yes. But even by Doris Day-Rock Hudson standards recoiling from the possibility of it is pathological. Unless of course youve paid - or are being paid - to sit through this. In which case recoiling is not only understandable. Its involuntary.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

"Movie Review Ann Hornaday on The Proposal With Sandra Bullock Ryan Reynolds washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On MOVIES Movie Review Ann Hornaday on The Proposal With Sandra Bullock Ryan Reynolds VideoThe ProposalSandra Bullock stars as a driven book editor who forces her assistant Ryan Reynolds to marry her so she can keep her visa and avoid deportation to Canada. Video by Walt Disney Pictures.>> LAUNCH VIDEO PLAYER Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 19 2009 Just looking at the poster for ""The Proposal"" a by-the-numbers romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds tells you exactly how its all gonna go down. Tightly wound dominatrix of a boss (Bullock) dressed in cinch-waisted suits and Christian Louboutin peep-toes that could put an eye out at 50 paces dragoons her long-suffering male secretary (Reynolds) into marrying her so her U.S. visa wont expire (shes Canadian). Testy arguments antic high jinks and true love ensue. Cue the adorable closing-credits sequence and were out Its as predictable and comforting as a Happy Meal but it must be said that ""The Proposal"" manages to elicit some genuinely amusing moments especially when it comes to physical comedy. Director Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") started out as a choreographer and thats still where she shines. She does a great job staging sequences in which Bullocks staff collectively shudders in horror when her character makes her way past their desks. (When she arrives at the office an internal instant message goes out ""Its here."") Later Fletcher makes a preposterous two-way naked body-slam work despite being painfully contrived. ""The Proposal"" is the kind of reassuringly bland and rigidly structured entertainment widget that depends on a series of ""wammies"" to give it any zip. Here they arrive in the form of fitfully funny slapstick moments including a labored bit of business involving a fluffy white dog a hungry eagle and a cellphone and a New Age ritualistic dance in which Bullock and Betty White (underused as Reynoldss kittenish grandmother) get all jiggy with it. A gag involving a randy waiter-stripper played by Oscar NuA+-ez of ""The Office"" goes on way too long. Reynolds and Bullock dont generate much chemistry but theyre cute and fun to watch and both can be thanked for bringing restraint to otherwise thankless roles. Reynolds gets to deliver some of ""The Proposals"" choicest lines most of them at the expense of Bullocks humorless character. When it turns out that they will be investigated by a suspicious U.S. immigration official (Denis OHare) he tells his boss that like all secretaries he knows way more about her than she does about him including her allergies ""to pine nuts and a full spectrum of human emotion."" And the gags keep coming in what turns out to be the comic bookend to the extravagant gore-fest ""Drag Me to Hell"" in which another powerful woman meets her comeuppance. Admittedly the heroine of that giddily gothic B-movie is punished by death. In ""The Proposal"" female aspiration is merely tamed in this case after some sly gender role-reversal in which Bullock manipulates her employee much in the same way that male bosses exploited secretaries and stenographers in 1950s melodramas. For a while there it looks as if ""The Proposal"" might turn out to be an interestingly subversive take on office sexual politics in the 21st century. But since when did that put tushies in seats? Finally ""The Proposal"" much like its heroine succumbs to the strictures of convention and dutifully fulfills its role in this case of living up to the poster. The Proposal (104 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content nudity and profanity.

The ones that kill are the bland ones the by-the-numbers movies that studios grind out like toxic sausage. The latest cinematic definition of insipid is The Proposal a romantic comedy so numbing it feels like Novocaine. (Watch Peter Travers video review of The Proposal.) Sandra Bullock is 44 but her high spirits and genuine comic skills appear to be ageless. So why cast her as a hardass Manhattan publishing diva and then turn her to marshmallow at the earliest scent of man candy? Thats what happens when she bullies her assistant (Ryan Reynolds) into marriage so she wont be deported back to Canada. If you cant figure out the ice thaw that follows welcome back to the multiplex after life on Mars. Anne Fletcher (perpetrator of the equally soporific 27 Dresses) directs Peter Chiarellis script like a manufacturer of hard plastic that is guaranteed to ward off intrusion from all recognizable human emotion. Only Betty White as someones nut job grandma cuts through the plot inertia. This forever golden girl is 87 (really) and her skills are indisputably ageless. White is the only spice in this watery stew. The one star rating Ive put on The Proposal is all for Betty. No one and I mean no one can get this sharp cookie to dull her edge.

She plays Margaret Tate an overbearing boss who forces Reynolds as assistant Andrew Paxton into marrying her.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted June 19 2009In recent years the romantic comedy or rom-com has cross-fertilized with other genres giving it new vigor. Rom-com and buddy movie mated to produce the bromance the platonic love story between men (I Love You Man). Last week romance and caveman comedy hooked up to produce what you might call bro-magnon mischief (The Hangover).This week - to comparably tasty effect - rom-com and slapstick farce conjoin to deliver the rom-romp in The Proposal. Hilarious fun it stars Sandra Bullock as a needling publisher Ryan Reynolds as a human pincushion and Guy Friday and a green-card problem as the plot device.Inside her publishing house Margaret Tate (Bullock) inspires fear. To alert the assistant pool that she is on the march Andrew (Reynolds) sends a global e-mail ""The witch is on her broom."" So busy is Margaret firing underlings that the publisher who happens to be Canadian forgets to file the paperwork for her green card.On the verge of deportation she blackmails Andrew into marrying her. He blackmails her back Shell get U.S. citizenship if he gets a promotion. And off together they go to Alaska for the 90th birthday of his beloved Grandma (Betty White).The setup is formula but Bullock and Reynolds supply surprising fizz and kick. Their characters compete to see who can toss the most withering barbs without moving his/her lips bringing new meaning to the word deadpan.These are two gifted physical comedians at the top of their game. When Bullock minces purposefully in 6-inch stilettos or when Reynolds - a hard-bodied 6-footer - gets small and soft like a mini-marshmallow its funny. Not chick-flick funny - across-the-board flat-out fall-down funny.Anne Fletcher choreographer-turned-director (Step Up 27 Dresses) uses her characters body language for maximum comic impact. Especially in the scene where Bullock freshly out of the shower and hunting for a towel runs smack into Reynolds stripped down for his after-workout ablutions.Peter Chiarellis script squarely hits the funny bone. In part its because the stars are cast against type and gender. Likable Bullock finds her sour spot as the unlikable Margaret; secure Reynolds is dithering fun as the insecure Andrew. That Margaret has the professional power Andrew craves helps make the film fresh.White plays a silver-haired version of her Golden Girls character a foxy grandma three beats ahead of everyone else. She gets laughs without being undignified something that cannot be said of supporting actor Oscar NuA+-ez. He plays Ramone a man who it would seem performs virtually every job in Sitka Alaska and is howlingly spittingly without-a-shred-of-dignity hysterical.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

Or at least thats the tack taken by The Proposal a romantic comedy that yokes Sandra Bullock to Ryan Reynolds as a sham couple then tries to compensate for the absence of chemistry by keeping them busybusybusy with random subplots and comic business. Look theres Oscar Nunez from The Office stripping And Betty White doing a tribal dance And Craig T. Nelson grimacing paternally And an eagle chasing a puppy Bullock plays a feared powerful book editor a job that apparently consists entirely of reading unsolicited manuscripts while riding an exercise bike and trying to coax authors into appearing on Oprah. Reynolds is her assistant a bundle of fear and loathing who hopes someday to become an editor himself. (Maybe he just wants an exercise bike?) When Bullock learns that her failure to sort out some immigration paperwork threatens to send her back to her native Canada she muscles Reynolds into agreeing to marry her threatening his job if he refuses. Realizing the situation unexpectedly gives him the upper hand he takes her up on the offer then attempts to make her life hell during a weekend trip to visit his family in Alaska on the occasion of Grandma Betty Whites 90th birthday. Though they never make a convincing couple either when theyre trying to fake it or when the movie--non-spoiler--pushes them closer to falling in love theres nothing really wrong with either of their performances. Reynolds has developed a talent for conveying wry indignation and Bullock slips back into frothy romantic-comedy mode as easily as if this were Miss Congeniality 3 Alaskan Adventure. Its the material that stinks failing to give even an old pro like White more than a couple of modest laughs then flailing between family psychodrama--Reynolds dad wants him to give up this book nonsense and come run his fathers small-town empire--and uninspired physical comedy without creating any sparks from the friction. Following 27 Dresses this is the second high-concept low-impact wedding-themed comedy in 18 months for choreographer-turned-director Anne Fletcher. It might be time to move on.

"movie review the proposal the proposal movie review sandra bullock ryan reynolds - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Movies Entertainment Movies Movie review The Proposal -- 3 out of 5 stars The Proposal Touchstone Pictures Speaking of age differences Sandra Bullocks Canadian book editor forces her younger much abused assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her so she can stay in the country. June 5 Speaking of age differences Sandra Bullocks Canadian book editor forces her younger much abused assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her so she can stay in the country. June 5 (Touchstone Pictures) Roger MooreOrlando Sentinel Movie Critic Sandra Bullock may be aging out of her the years when Hollywood sees her as Miss Congeniality but not without one last fling. The Proposal has her playing the icy boss who blackmails her younger assistant into a sham marriage to save her Green Card. Its a performance with real comic juice a woman acting her age and matched by a co-star whose comic timing complements her own -- the very face of big-screen sarcasm Ryan Reynolds.And if she has held out until shes 44 to deliver her first-ever honest-to-Keanu nude scene honey it was worth the wait. Margaret Tate is a book publisher a humorless martinet whose staff quakes in her presence and emails warnings about her every move.""The witch is on her broom."" She gives as good as she gets. Her put downs are half-whispered asides that everyone hears especially her long-suffering assistant Drew (Reynolds) who cant let on that hes just had to make a personal call to cancel a trip to his grannys 90th birthday because of work.""That your family?""""Yes.""""They tell you to quit?"" ""Every single day.""But shes Canadian and she has ignored the warnings about her status. Just as shes about to become queen of all she surveys at her firm deportation awaits. She lies on the fly tells the boss that shes about to get married and names poor Drew whom she knows nothing about as the lucky fella. The catch -- its not just the boss they must fool. Immigration is leery of such sudden nuptials. Theyve seen Green Card too.Theyre off to ""get to know"" each other and tell Drews family the happy news. They live in Alaska and Ma and Pa (Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen) are not what youd expect especially not Granny ( Betty White a hoot as always).Director Anne Fletcher (27 Dresses) doesnt serve up many surprises but she lets her practiced cast go through their paces and thats almost enough. The finale flounders after the fun that came before.Bullocks longtime fans should be happy to see her fully engaged in a role that suits her and paired at last with her comic equal Reynolds.Maybe theres a Diane Keaton future for her in mature romances or maybe this is Sandys last best shot. But dressed to the nines or naked as a jaybird theres nothing indecent about her in Proposal.

Nelson Betty White; Director Anne Fletcher; Author Pete Chiarelli; Release Date Wide 06/19/2009; Runtime (in minutes) 103; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Walt Disney Pictures Posted June 17 2009 -- 1200 AM EDT How are the elements of the charming ? traditional romantic comedy The Proposal like the checklist of a charming traditional bride? Let me count the ways... Something old The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and 50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeares 1590s? Sandra Bullock is the shrew Margaret a pitiless high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get...loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew her put-upon foil of an executive assistant a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. And there the two would remain locked in mutual disdain except for Margarets fatal flaw -- shes Canadian. (So is X-Mens Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) Margaret with her visa expired faces deportation and makes the snap ?executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. Its an offer the underling cant refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movies mood.) Okay he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-bes family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. Something new The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s Bullock has finessed her dewy Americas Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature pearly texture; shes lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe. Reynolds meanwhile is just refining his dry comedy thing learning to get the most from his deceptive cute-face looks. Who knew these two would hmmm complete each other? Working together both are surer and more disciplined in delivering their comedy goods. Something borrowed The boisterous family dynamics. The eccentric supporting players (none more extreme than Oscar Nunez from The Office). The snappy screwball? dialogue in Pete Chiarellis script. And the way Anne Fletcher directs like a camp counselor wrangling bunkmates...its all been seen before. For a reason. These elements work. Something blue As the wise and saucy matriarch of the family the divine 87-year-old Betty White has fun as one hot grandma -- and inspires her younger stars to say ""I do"" too.

The Proposal Director Anne Fletcher. Cast Sandra Bullock Ryan Reynolds Craig T. Nelson. Rating PG-13 for sexual content nudity and language. Related Sandra Bullock is ready to show she can still do it all Shirts off boys Spotlight Sandra Bullock Chick flicks From what? From himself thats what. Or his agent. He makes too many bad romantic comedies. Sure hes almost always good in them elevating movies like ""Definitely Maybe"" and ""Chaos Theory"" but good players get sick of playing on bad teams eventually right? (Ask any NBA star who used to play for the Los Angeles Clippers.) This time its his turn to make ""The Proposal"" better than it otherwise might have been. He gets great notices for his brief performance as Deadpool in the otherwise forgettable ""X-Men Origins Wolverine"" then shows up in this? Dude. This is not the way to build career momentum. Sandra Bullock stars as Margaret Tate a hell-on-wheels editor at a publishing company who has the misfortune of being Canadian. Thats not a statement about the country - shes facing deportation because considering herself above all such bothersome things as laws shes blown off the government at every turn. Reynolds plays Andrew Paxton her long-suffering assistant who puts up with her constant mistreatment of him because hes a writer and figures this is his best hope to get published. Suddenly a brainwave If she marries Andrew she can stay in the country. Wow bet you didnt see that one coming Kidding Of course you did As you will practically everything else that follows. Well maybe not this bit. Andrew realizes he has Margaret over a barrel. He takes her home for his grandmothers 90th-birthday party; happily shes played by Betty White. Bawdy old ladies are just plain funny and no old ladies are bawdier than White. Turns out Andrews rich but more or less estranged from his father (a surly Craig T. Nelson). A government agent (Denis OHare) suspects Margaret and Andrew are cooking up a fake marriage so they use the trip to the party to announce their engagement. So weve got a prodigal son who has the chance to deal with his father issues and discover things about his heretofore evil boss. Its like a romantic-comedy cliche twofer. Bullock is OK as Margaret though shes not done any favors by the script. But Reynolds is again his reliable self. Here he takes a stock role and imbues it with more depth than it deserves. Andrew isnt just uncomfortable with a sham marriage hes unhappy with his life and its direction. Angry even in Reynolds portrayal. Or maybe its not acting. Maybe Reynolds finally figured out what kind of movies he keeps showing up in including ""The Proposal"" and is simply reacting accordingly.

"Proposal The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; proposal-the ) Proposal The (United States 2009) June 16 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli The Proposal is a standard-order by-the-book romantic comedy that offers nothing remotely fresh or new while following a formula even neophytes know by heart. For some people thats enough. All a certain segment of the audience wants from romantic comedies are familiar names smiley faces and hearts dotting the letter ""i"". Others who are a bit more discriminating will recognize that although The Proposal follows a paint-by-numbers script it fails one key acid test it doesnt sell the romance. The genre is rife with contrivances but those shaky plot devices are easy enough to forgive if not entirely forget if the movie catches the viewer up in the spirit of falling in love. Its what separates the enjoyable rom-coms from the ones that strive to tickle the underbelly of mediocrity and The Proposal does not come out on the right side of that divider. The story twists and turns and contorts to get Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) and her administrative assistant Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to Alaska where they can face his family with the ""happy"" news that theyre engaged. This happens because Margaret the chief editor at a Boston-based publishing house is about to be deported to Canada because her green card application has been rejected (due in large part to her negligence). The only way for her to remain in the United States and keep her job is for her to gain a fiancA(c) VISA. So she latches onto the nearest male - Andrew - and blackmails him into becoming engaged. But the United States government represented by the slimy Mr. Gilbertson (Denis OHare) knows the couple is up to no good and plans to put them through the wringer. Margaret and Andrew have one weekend to be spent in Alaska at the house owned by Andrews parents (Mary Steenburgen Craig T. Nelson) to take a crash course learning about one another while celebrating the birthday of Andrews octogenarian grandmother Annie (Betty White). It should not be considered a spoiler to reveal that the two actually fall in love. After all thats the point of the movie and the only reason any percentage of the population will see it. (Also once youve watched the three-minute trailer there is no point in seeing the 108-minute film - not only does the trailer tell the whole story but it includes all the best comedic material.) Admittedly it might have been more enjoyable had the screenplay changed things up a little - like perhaps amplifying the relationship between Andrew and his old flame Gertrude (Malin Akerman) and allowing Margaret to find redemption by letting him go. But thats too much to ask from an autopilot movie crafted by Anne Fletcher whose resume includes 27 Dresses (which she directed) and The Wedding Planner (which she associate produced). No The Proposal is all about Sandra and Ryan and how these two start out unable to stand one another and end up kissing on the brink of happily ever-after. As a bonus he finds his cojones and she re-discovers her humanity. The problem which I alluded to earlier is that the romance falls flat. It has nothing to do with chemistry. Bullock and Reynolds dont burn up the screen but theyre nice enough together. The problem is theres really only a single scene - the one in which she reclines in bed while he lies on the floor and she reveals things about her past - in which they are given a chance to connect. On the basis of that were supposed to believe that three years of belittlement have been swept aside in a tide of sentiment. The movie doesnt give us enough to go on to believe that these two have fallen in love. Those who buy it will do so because the formula demands it not because the movie has succeeded in closing the sale. There are some funny moments chief of which is the overhyped ""nude"" scene in which Margaret fresh from the shower and wearing nothing (but with arms and hands strategically positioned so the rating can remain PG-13) collides with an equally in-the-buff Andrew. Its more amusing than laugh-aloud funny and its about as naughty as things can get without crossing the line into R territory. Most of The Proposals jokes are like that in that they provoke smiles and chuckles but fail to generate any really good laughs. The cast isnt populated by heavyweights. It has been a while since Sandra Bullock has been in the fast lane and its been about a decade since she was a prime romantic comedy actress. Ryan Reynolds who showed flashes of genuine talent in Adventureland is back to phoning it in. (Although to be fair his flummoxed expression when Andrew ""learns"" hes engaged to Margaret - which carries through more than one scene - is possibly the films funniest element.) Mary Steenburgen and Craig T. Nelson are playing the stereotyped father/mother roles and Betty White is pretty much exhuming her Golden Girls character. (This is not one of those roles in which she drops a string of f-bombs and other assorted profanities - something she has done on more than one occasion to get a cheap guffaw.) My opinion of The Proposal is similar to how I felt about the not-dissimilar New in Town. The humor level in this film is a little better and the actors have a marginally higher charisma quotient but the productions are peas in a pod. They fail to engage for similar reasons. Both Bullock (with While You Were Sleeping) and Reynolds (with Definitely Maybe) have solidly enjoyable derivative romantic comedy titles in their filmographies and it would be more rewarding to investigate those than endure the regurgitated cardboard taste of The Proposal.

You know every tinny beat and false note by heart from the implausible setup to the sprint-to-the-airport finish. The Proposal in fact appears to have been written using a secret cache of computers stored beneath Walt Disney HQ since 1978--codename ""Pete Chiarelli"" the first-time screenwriter who receives credit for having pilfered every rom-com convention since the invention of breathing. (It was directed by Anne Fletcher who stitched together 27 Dresses out of the leftover scraps not used here.) Or perhaps its the product of a book of MadLibs in which spaces are left blank for The Handsome Male Ingenue Specializing in Cocked Eyebrows The Former Rom-Com It-Girl on Comeback Trail Who Looks 10 Years Younger Than Her Age and The Ex-Golden Girl as Dirty-Minded Grandmother. Already filled in Craig T. Nelson and Mary Steenburgen as The Parents and Malin Akerman as The One Who Got Away. And there you have it HBO instaclassic ""Here comes the bride"" utters the posters tagline. Genius. Such great minds.

""The Proposal"" wont catch any bouquets for originality but in terms of a bended-knee pitch for the affections of women -- including Ryan Reynolds boyish charms a hip granny and even a beyond-adorable puppy -- this romantic comedy pretty much pulls out all the stops. Mostly this safe and calculated Reynolds-Sandra Bullock pairing constitutes savvy counterprogramming what with the ""Transformers"" sequel about to invade theaters and ""The Hangover"" mostly hanging onto men. So even if the movie stumbles a bit on the way to the altar the net result should leave Disney celebrating reasonably happy returns. Director Anne Fletcher (""27 Dresses"") is working from a script by Peter Chiarelli but the story draws from so many sources the whole exercise has the feel of a committee effort. Bullock plays Margaret Tate a book editor so tyrannical -- holy ""The Devil Wears Prada"" Batman -- that the message ""Its here"" is instantly dispatched when she enters the office as her minions hop to appear as busy as possible. Anticipating Margarets needs is the job of her assistant Andrew (Reynolds) but hes thrown for a loop when Margaret -- a Canadian suddenly facing deportation -- tells him they must get married a maneuver that will not only keep her in the U.S. but save his job. Andrew blackmails her right back with the threat of backing out and before you know it theyre flying off to his hometown in Alaska to break the news to his family -- and throw an officious immigration agent (Denis OHare) off the scent. So ""Green Card"" segues into ""Northern Exposure"" as the starched high-heeled Manhattan-dweller Margaret is exposed to Andrews colorful clan including his aloof father (Craig T. Nelson) loving mom (Mary Steenburgen) and wacky about-to-turn-90 grandma (Betty White still more than capable of stealing every scene shes in). Inevitably a thaw begins between the assistant and the boss he dubbed ""Satans mistress"" -- one helped along by seeing each other in various stages of undress which is sure to elicit whoops from the appropriate demographics. For Reynolds that will only bolster his romantic-comedy credentials as he and Bullock deftly capture the requisite awkwardness of having to deceive those around them. (Notably Bullock found herself in a similar predicament in ""While You Were Sleeping."") Although theres plenty of rustic scenery (with Massachusetts as a stand-in for Palin country) prolonging the buildup eventually leads to some tired and silly flourishes. Fletcher started out as a choreographer and even gives Bullock a chance to show off some amusing dance gyrations but all that nifty footwork becomes a bit more frantic down the home stretch. By then though ""The Proposal"" has generated enough goodwill to get by -- and theres even a parting shot of White holding that fluffy snow-colored puppy. In that respect its difficult not to admire a project that not only knows whats expected of it but precisely what its assets are.
