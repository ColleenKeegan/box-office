They all to some extent involve a young child or particularly immature man falling prey to a terrible crime accident experiment or alternately reluctantly getting chosen by higher powers. Then comes a period of shock swiftly followed by a period of combat training--for as all comic lovers understand a true hero directs his mournful energies toward coordinating outfits gadgets and crime-fighting prowess around a theme. The takeaway Superheroes are just like you and me until something genuinely terrible befalls them--then an inhumanly noble hunger to fight crime takes over.On the surface Guardians of the Galaxy Marvels latest movie is an origin story too. Given the obscurity of the source comic it has to be Our heroes a bunch of alien rogues were introduced briefly in a 1969 issue of Marvel Superheroes played benchwarmers to the likes of the Avengers for about 50 years then were revived by writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning in 2008 to middling sales. To counteract the risk of the venture we follow recognizable white male Chris Pratt newly buff and emotional playing Peter Quill a boy who was abducted by aliens and now calls himself ""Star-Lord.""Related Story Guardians of the Galaxy A Likable Mess Sensibly Peters chosen alias is roundly mocked by his fellow Guardians in the film--as is his masculinity wooing capabilities general leadership and other qualities that usually endorse newbie heroes in tights. Pratt is at the point in his career when critics would label him an ""unlikely leading man""; here he actually plays one to his scrappy squabbling intergalactic crew. As the title suggests theyre the real heroes of this kinda-sorta-superhero movie. If Guardians of the Galaxy is an origin story it is also a satire of the origin story one that emphasizes the power of the ""We"" over that of the ""Chosen One.""Every member of the Guardians has known deep trauma. Chris Pratts lead Peter Quill lost his mom (cancer); Zoe Saldanas Gamora is practically dead to the last surviving member of her family Nebula (Karen Gillan); her previous colleague-in-crime Ronan (Lee Pace) slaughtered the family of Dave Bautistas Drax; and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) doesnt even have a family since as a human experiment in anthropomorphization gone wrong hes basically a lab animal. As for his pet the sentient tree Groot (Vin Diesel) who knows? He can only string together three words (the innocuous truth ""I am Groot""). Judging by the way he tortures his adversaries--pushing his roots into their nostrils out other orifices--its safe to assume the tree has issues too.But in contrast to the rest of the genre these sob stories dont bestow nobility. No ones particular woes are more ""super"" than anothers. In fact any attempt at tragedy one-upmanship would counteract the movies shaggy communal comedy. The Guardians arent superheroes so much as they are a heterogeneous mix of losers bandits and outlaws who know just how unexceptional they are. As Chris Pratts character says to rally the troops ""I look around and I see losers. Like people who have lost something.""The real reason they connect is because theyre all lucky sellouts not Chosen Ones. The point of their big entree into superherodom is to scrape together some prize money by selling the mysterious Infinity Stone this franchises equivalent of the equally irrelevant MacGuffin in The Avengers the Cosmic Cube. The film then becomes a series of encounters that all lead up to the faceoff with the slithery highest bidder. While Guardians welcomes comparisons to Star Wars theres no Luke paragon of high-minded heroic ideals--our heroes are all a bunch of opportunistic Hans ineloquent Wookies and cowardly C-3POs. Yes theyre a strong sad bunch but in total its a managerial nightmare to corral a team around a single crime-fighting objective sans incessant arguments.According to the movie a superheros sad strength is merely a culturally acceptable form of pigheadedness.In fact Guardians of the Galaxy makes the case that a heros individual strength amounts to merely a culturally acceptable form of pigheadedness. Take the movies portrayal of Drax a conflicted vigilante with only one thing on his mind--avenging his murdered wife and child. Its a generic motivation and another movie might try to use him to bring us to tears. But here he nearly dies in the attempt for revenge thus endangering the greater mission to make money. ""Weve all got dead people"" his compatriot Rocket Raccoon scoffs. And for one moment of wonderful lucidity a Marvel movie makes sport of Marvels big profitable trope the prolonged mourning of buff guys in tights.The lampooning is more playful than genuinely threatening to the Marvel universe though. For however much Guardians critiques the usual fare its still bookended by Chris Pratts tragic flashbacks a technique reminiscent of Christopher Nolans super-serious Batman Begins. The flashbacks are the movies least convincing moments either because theyre too earnest for the self-conscious flick or the actor isnt as good at shedding tears as he is at acting a buffoon on Parks and Recreation.The origin story isnt some morally fraught trope that needs toppling either. In fact psychologist Robin Rosenburg has noted that superhero origin stories teach us ""how to be heroes choosing altruism over the pursuit of wealth and power.""But if were going to take them seriously as instructions for how to be altruistic super-individuals origin stories could also teach teamwork. This is where Guardians of the Galaxy at its most delightfully self-aware has a new take. It doesnt pretend like its heroes are not all mortals with an interest in pursuing that plebeian concern money. Even so it does show that a group of flawed losers can take down a planetary dictator with an enchanted stone if for one moment they forget their own baggage and hack out a semblance of a plan first.  This post originally stated that Gamora is Ronans sister. We regret the error.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future. Continue Reading Charles Mostoller / Reuters Can Personality Be Changed? Scott Barry Kaufman Psychologists have long debated how flexible someones ""true"" self is. Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

"Review Guardians of the Galaxys heroes arent what youd expect - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Guardians of the Galaxys heroes arent what youd expect Guardians of the Galaxy Marvel Zoe Saldana Vin Diesel Dave Bautista and Chris Pratt star in ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" Zoe Saldana Vin Diesel Dave Bautista and Chris Pratt star in ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" (Marvel) Kenneth Turan Contact Reporter Review Guardians of the Galaxy is an entertaining throwback to Marvels roots Hard as it is to believe within the memory of those still living Marvel was not always the movie establishments billion-dollar behemoth but a scrappy iconoclastic comic book gadfly. So one of the most pleasant surprises of the altogether pleasant and surprising ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is that it takes us back to Marvels roots and the subversive satisfactions those early days provided.Yes ""Guardians"" cost a reported 170 million but no one was obsessing about screwing up the franchise here certainly not co-writer and director James Gunn whose no-status Troma Entertainment past doesnt allow anyone to take anything too seriously. Blessed with a loose anarchic B-picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when youre not quite sure whats going on the scruffy ""Guardians"" is irreverent in a way that can bring the first ""Star Wars"" to mind in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes -- would you believe a raccoon and a tree? -- this side of the Mos Eisley cantina.This Five Against the House ragtag bunch of misfits rascals and rebels a kind of garage band of the universe form an alliance of the dispossessed that makes up in attitude what it lacks in status. Its easy to understand why Marvel worried so much about this group that it put ""From the studio that brought you The Avengers"" at the bottom of its advertising. Though its action takes place exclusively in faraway galaxies ""Guardians"" begins with a prelude set on Earth in 1988 that explains how a 9-year-old boy ends up in outer space and why his most prized possession is a homemade mix tape of 1970s hits labeled ""Awesome Mix 1."" Guardians of the Galaxy director James Gunn prepares for liftoff Gina McIntyre Gina McIntyre Cut to 26 years later and that young boy is Peter Quill a self-assured self-involved adventurer who hopes humanoids dont laugh when he calls himself Star Lord.Not to put too fine a point on it Quill (brought to insouciant comic life by ""Parks and Recreations"" Chris Pratt) is an intergalactic junkman who works for Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his merry band of amoral plunderers. Trailer Guardians of the Galaxy Marvels space-romping prates-turned-heroes spread their infamy. Marvels space-romping prates-turned-heroes spread their infamy. See more videos Just at the moment Quill finds himself on the abandoned planet Morag trying to get his hands on a certain orb. (Its always an orb isnt it?) Why anyone would want this revolving item isnt made immediately clear but its soon apparent that lots of other folks covet it too. Top of the list because he is so powerful -- and so mean and nasty -- is arch-villain Ronan the Accuser (the shape-shifting Lee Pace) who wants it so badly he sends Gamora a.k.a. the deadliest woman in the galaxy (the always reliable Zoe Saldana) to get it away from Quill by any means necessary.The action switches to the planet Xandar kind of an outer space version of Earth where the films most outlandish characters the bounty-hunting team of Rocket and Groot take aim at the orb as well.Though hed prefer you didnt mention it Rocket is a genetically altered cybernetically enhanced talking raccoon. Voiced with enormous zest by Bradley Cooper Rocket is fierce and foul-tempered the master of take-no-prisoners repartee who like Howard the Duck before him is trapped in a world he never made.Rockets only friend is Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel who did ""The Iron Giant"" back in the day) a walking tree whose single English sentence (""I am Groot"") has to be made to function in multiple situations.Much more loquacious and considerably less even-tempered is Drax the Destroyer who meets the other four when everyone is incarcerated in the massive Kyln prison that services Xandar. As played by former WWE wrestling champion Dave Bautista Drax talks like a thesaurus and is covered with such strange tattoo scarring that its estimated he spent seven entire days in makeup over the course of the shoot.For reasons that finally dont matter no group but this wild bunch is in a position to save the universe from Ronans destructive impulses and you can just imagine how much energetic action is required before things sort themselves out.One of the pleasures of ""Guardians"" is that in addition to the adventure it provides its script written by Gunn and Nicole Perlman has amusing lines like Gamoras understandable fear that ""I am going to die surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy.""Director Gunn is a fine imaginer of worlds someone who knows when to build physical sets (like the massive Kyln prison which used 100 tons of steel) and when to dream things up like the enormous decapitated head of a Celestial big enough to contain an entire mining town.Most of all like kids turned loose in a candy store Gunn and company have endowed their film with a sense of fun like slyly connecting the action to such 1970s hits as 10ccs ""Im Not in Love"" and Blue Swedes ""Hooked on a Feeling"" that are on Quills awesome mix tape. When you see the inevitable tag line ""The Guardians of the Galaxy Will Return"" you may well start counting the days.kenneth.turanlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Column Reviews Star Wars Michael Rooker Bradley Cooper Guardians of the Galaxy Chris Pratt goes from saddest to baddest Guardians of the Galaxy Zoe Saldana channels masculinity for Gamora Audiences ready to marvel at Guardians of the Galaxy Guardians of the Galaxy Behold Dave Bautista says (only) as Drax Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad71deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-guardians-galaxy-review-20140801-column.html,200,guardiansofthegalaxy1,guardiansofthegalaxy,latimes

Young Peter Quill (Wyatt Oleff) stands brooding outside his dying mothers hospital room and holding a cassette player with an ""Awesome Mix"" of 70s pop hits his mom gave him. He walks into the room and is given a present. ""You open it when Im gone"" his mom says and then addresses her final words to Peter ""Take my hand."" But he doesnt and she as if in response to her sons slight promptly dies. The boy rushes agonized into the starry night where an alien spaceship Hoovers him up for a life in outer space. Twenty-six years later when Peter (now Chris Pratt) has grown into a brawny rogue who calls himself ""Star-Lord"" he will still feel a special poignancy for his mom -- not because he refused her last wish but because she gave him that cool mix tape. The emotional signals are going haywire in these early scenes from Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy. Peter is a sensitive kid about to make an interplanetary connection like young Elliot in Steven Spielbergs E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. Yet the adult Peter seems hardly to recall his mistreatment of his mother -- a rejection that should saddle him with years of psychotherapy and a lifetime of guilt. He just wants to play moms oldies as he grows into a facsimile of another early-80s Spielberg hero Indiana Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark. And not the archaeologist Indy. This is the Indy who when hes menaced by a scimitar-wielding Arab doesnt reach for his famous bullwhip. He just pulls out a revolver and shoots the guy dead. (READ Richard Schickels 1981 review of Raiders of the Lost Ark by subscribing to TIME) This self-styled ""legendary outlaw"" unknown to most of his adversaries is an anomaly in the Marvel canon. The first reel of director-cowriter James Gunns movie tipped us off that Peter Quill is no Peter Parker whose guilt over Uncle Bens death deeply informed his Spider-Man personality. The new Peter unhaunted and largely conscience-free is Indy plus Han Solo; and Guardians is a jauntier far brattier Star Wars. Alas making fun and profit of the George Lucas saga is a tactic about 30 years behind the curve; Mel Brooks did it with giddier panache in the 1987 Spaceballs. Not so much a hero on a quest as a stud in a reality-show survival game Peter hooks up with the green Gamora (Avatars Zoe Saldana) the muscle-bound elaborately tattooed Drax (Dave Bautista) the snarky raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and a tree-being named Groot (grunted by Vin Diesel). Dubbing themselves as Rocket proclaims ""the frickin Guardians of the Galaxy"" they hurt villains battle the Taliban-ish zealot Ronan (Lee Pace) and eventually bond into a group tight enough to warrant the sequel announced at the end. Peters gang might be the Wild Bunch of Merry Men -- or more aptly the far-flung Expendables. For if the Marvel comics owners had held a garage sale of their least valuable subheroes and youd bought five you might have accidentally assembled the Guardians team. The quintets mythology fills only a half-page of the 400-page Marvel Encyclopedia; pleas for immortalizing them on film have been muted. But the companys movie craw must be fed so heres the fourth Marvel movie in four months after the excellent Captain America The Winter Soldier and two inessential installments The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and X-Men Days of Future Past. (READ Corlisss review of Captain America The Winter Soldier) The movies MacGuffin -- Alfred Hitchcocks word for the precious mysterious contrivance that drives an action-films plot -- is an orb that Peter says has ""an Ark of the Covenant Maltese Falcon kind of vibe."" That line keys Gunns central strategy making explicit reference to dozens of movies and pop songs mostly of 70s and 80s vintage. Like Captain Americas Steve Rogers who needs to catch up on 70 years of pop culture but concentrates on 70s songs and films Peter and Gunn are steeped in nostalgia for that decade. (Such oldies as ""Im Not In Love"" ""Hooked on a Feeling"" ""The Pina Colada Song"" ""Ooh Child"" and ""Aint No Mountain High Enough"" spring from Peters moms mix tape onto the soundtrack CD.) Gunn not only filches from the trove he graciously acknowledges the theft. Hes like a burglar who takes all your stuff and leaves a descriptive Post-It where each stolen item used to be. Give points to Pratt who plays Andy Dwyer on Parks and Recreation and provided the voice of the clueless hero Emmet in The LEGO Movie for gleefully throwing himself into the farrago. And sympathize with Saldana who has to play a less stately version of her Neytiri from Avatar. (Shes not far off when she exasperates ""Im surrounded by the biggest idiots in the galaxy."") Coopers adroitly animated Rocket is the most annoying of the group. The arboreal Groot is a sweetly mournful creature -- a galactic poobah named Rhomann Dey (John C. Reilly) calls him ""Rockets personal houseplant-slash-muscle"" -- in whose service Diesel must have spent all of five minutes in the recording studio intoning variations on the line ""I am Groot"" (READ The Socialist message behind The LEGO Movie) Bautista gets the best lines as Drax whose brain is so maddeningly literal that when someone says ""Metaphors go over his head"" he shouts ""Nothing goes over my head My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it."" But the former WWE champ lacks the wit beneath the bulk shown by Dwayne Johnson Andre the Giant and other pro wrestlers turned movie actors. The film has some cool fight scenes as when Peter and Gamora engage in furious karate while both are flat on their backs and some stellar art direction one of the groups tours takes them to Planet Knowhere visualized as the giant severed head of an ancient celestial being. These are brief diversions in what Gunn may intend as a fondly mocking deconstruction of the more serious Marvel movies. If so hes just being redundant. The Iron Man and Captain America films are well aware of their outlandish elements; Tony Stark and Steve Rogers often make depreciating jokes about themselves. (READ How Tony Stark got a heart in Iron Man Three\) Moviegoers who have wearied of the super-serious father issues that afflict Marvel heroes -- not just Peter Parker but also Tony Stark and Loki in the Thor franchise -- may welcome this new films practiced carelessness and be grateful that Peter Quills memories of his mother are confined to loving her taste of pop music. But the lightly derisive live-action-cartoon tone robs the movie of any majesty even of the comic-book type and the many violent deaths of their suitable gravity. Something important has to be at stake in a Marvel movie; it isnt here. If the studio bosses think that Guardians of the Galaxy has both the weight and the buoyancy that make some Marvel movies supreme entertainments the jokes on them.

Most of the juice in this Marvel Studios behemoth comes from wisecracking Chris Pratt completing his decade-long metamorphosis from comic chubster to chiseled action hero and an ironic soundtrack of 70s and 80s dance hits which Pratts character accesses from a treasured mixtape cassette that his dying mother gave him back on planet earth. As you might have guessed these meager pleasures are swallowed up in all the frantic action and overblown CG sequences.

The plots MacGuffin is a mysterious orb that the newly formed team of Guardians (played by a ragtag group of actors augmented by C.G.I. effects) must keep out of the hands of an evil universe-threatening maniac. The film directed and co-written by James Gunn is joyfully irreverent. Gunn lends his underachiever superheroes a geeky comic camaraderie and he brings a spry touch to the wacky intergalactic adventure. Chris Pratt overflowing with charisma plays the leader of the pack of misfits and his blissed-out space cowboy (with a love for seventies music) is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects.

"Guardians of the Galaxy - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Guardians of the Galaxy Posted by Christy Lemire on August 2 2014 19 Comments Walt Disney Pictures Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and for some language. Running time 121 minutes. Three stars out of four. As Im writing this review of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" I have ""Come and Get Your Love"" the bouncy 1974 pop tune by Redbone stuck in my head. Actually its been stuck in my head pretty much non-stop ever since I saw the movie earlier this week. Chris Pratts character -- a space scavenger who refers to himself as Star-Lord although nobody else does -- dances around and listens to the song on a decidedly low-tech Walkman while dressed in high-tech gear to search a cave for a mysterious object. The catchy chorus kicks in just as the title bursts across the screen in giant vibrant yellow. Its a joyous moment and an early indication of the irreverent infectious vibe that makes ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" the cheekiest wackiest blockbuster of the summer. You dont need to know anything about this Marvel property to enjoy it. The characters who make up this motley crew arent nearly as familiar as Iron Man or Captain America or the Hulk but theyve got a relatably flawed humanity to them -- which is ironic given that most of them arent even human in the first place. Director and co-writer James Gunn brings a giddiness and a wondrous endless sense of why-the-hell-not? possibility thats reminiscent of ""Star Wars"" -- sorry ""Episode IV A New Hope"" -- as well as some character similarities to match. But well get to all that later. Pratt stars as Peter Quill an unflappably confident rogue and ladies man who bops from one job to the next staying on his toes and staying out of trouble in a mixed-up future. As we see in the films dramatic start he lost his mom to cancer when he was a kid and then promptly got sucked into space by a timely UFO. Now that hes in his 30s hes a loner a rebel -- and his only tie to Earth is the mix tape of 70s pop songs that serves as his own personal soundtrack to all his adventures. (And seriously its an inspired combination of music everything from The Runaways and David Bowie to 10cc and the Jackson 5. The choices are so not-obvious and theyre used so effectively theyre a powerful part of the movies off-kilter charm.) On his latest assignment Quill takes possession of an orb whose value and power he cant even begin to understand. (The moment in which he steals it is reminiscent of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" which is fitting given Quills enthusiasm for pop culture.) But it also makes him a target. People and creatures of various species also want this shiny silvery ball for themselves. They include the exotic killing machine Gamora (Zoe Saldana who looks as striking in green here as she did in blue in ""Avatar"") adopted daughter of the evil Thanos whos now working for the evil Ronan (Lee Pace); a talking gun-toting raccoon named Rocket (voiced hilariously by a raw and raucous Bradley Cooper in a genius bit of casting); and his sidekick a sweetly lumbering tree named Groot who can say exactly three words ""I am Groot."" The running bit is that he says them with a variety of inflections and only Rocket can understand him. It sounds pretty simple but it works every time. Vin Diesel ""plays"" the tree if you will -- a gnarled shape-shifter that calls to mind the beautiful and frightening creatures that so often populate Guillermo Del Toros films. When the four are thrown in jail together they reluctantly realize they must team up if theyre to survive; their escape which Rocket masterminds is a doozy of timing and teamwork. Also joining them is the beefy and tatted fellow prisoner Drax the Destroyer (wrestling star Dave Bautista) who has his own agenda and must make his own sacrifices for the greater good. The running bit with him is that he takes everything everyone says extremely literally. Metaphors and idioms baffle him and this innocence gives him an unexpected childlike quality despite his fearsome appearance. Also in the mix are the bounty hunter who abducted and trained Quill (Michael Rooker); the police official whos on the hunt for this ragtag team (an underused John C. Reilly); and the military leader Nova Prime (an elegant Glenn Close). Benicio Del Toro appears dashingly fleetingly as The Collector who explains what exactly this orb is capable of doing. Things can get a little crowded in the screenplay from Gunn and Nicole Perlman. Similarly the massive chases and battle sequences -- and the ensuing destruction they cause -- feel a bit overstuffed a bit overlong. (A blasphemous thought to suggest restraint in a such a sci-fi epic I realize.) ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" works best in its detail and dialogue and in the ways these disparate characters feel each other out learn to abandon their mistrust and come together as a team. Theyve all suffered loss. Theyve all been mistreated. And as corny as it sounds they all find a true family where they least expected it. This development isnt nearly as mawkish as it sounds; Gunn whose previous films include the subversive superhero flick ""Super"" finds just the right balance between zaniness and sentiment. He keeps things light even while infusing them with heart. And much of that comes from the top from the leadership of Pratt whos having a tremendous year. Between this and ""The Lego Movie"" in which he provides the voice of generic construction worker Emmet another unlikely hero Pratt stars in the two most flat-out fun films of 2014. Charismatic as hell he doesnt seem to take himself too seriously and yet hes totally in command when the moment calls for him to kick some ass. (Hes been to the gym since the last time you saw him with his shirt off FYI.) And if we can get back to that ""Star Wars"" comparison for a second Its not a perfect analogy but this core foursome did remind me of those classic characters from a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Quills got a lot of Han Solo in him but as the groups leader he sort of functions as the Luke Skywalker figure. Gamora the smart and rebellious daughter of aristocracy is our de facto Princess Leia. Rocket is most assuredly Han Solo -- globe-trotting tough-talking and rough around the edges. And the hulking well-intentioned Groot couldnt be anyone but Chewbacca. Theres even a villain in a dark helmet (Ronan) who takes orders from the hologram vision of an even more established supervillian. I cant wait to find out what adventures they get into in their version of ""The Empire Strikes Back.""

Your attention to detail is noted and appreciated. Reply August 2 2014  by  Rocket     I love that you mentioned the title screen. The moment you see Star-Lords silhouette dancing under the logo I was sunk down in my seat with a huge grin and gripping my popcorn. I havent had such a fun movie-going experience in a while. Reply August 4 2014  by  Joseph R. Jones     This is the most fun Ive had at the movies in a while now. First and foremost its a buddy movie. As such it depends heavily on the chemistry between the characters. Fortunately it totally works on that level. The dialog in particular stood out. Im a huge fan of Sorkin and Tarantino style dialog- written the way you wish people talked. Delivered by the right actors that kind of dialog is great. This is the opposite The dialog in Guardians is how you would talk if you lived in that universe and the writer (and actors) find humor in the imperfections of human interaction. Absolutely hilarious and brilliant. I would cite some examples but I dont want to spoil anything. Suffice it to say that there are third beats where there would normally be one liners and they pay off. Im also a fan of movies that have a rhythm to them- movies like ""Get Shorty"" or Pulp Fiction use a combination of soundtrack and editing to move the story forward but it only works when it is planned from the beginning. Same here- the music is brought in and woven into the very fabric of the filmmaking yet the way its introduced into the story works. Reply August 4 2014  by  ram     Rocket and Groots dialog is also reminiscent of C3P0 and R2D2. Good stuff Reply August 14 2014  by  John     Or Han and Chewie.  Reply August 4 2014  by  Rachel Cat     I cant believe you cant wait the the next ""installment"" of this pathetic franchise. Are you 12? This film was an extremely sad commentary on our society today. Shame on you. Reply August 5 2014  by  Cliff     ""Who put the sticks up their butts?"" - Gamora (probably to Rachel Cat) Reply September 21 2014  by  cindy     Perfect. Reply August 5 2014  by  tinkbarb123     Ill engage Cat. What parts of society were the ""sad commentary?"" The elements of pure kindness and generosity that was the embodiment of the character of Groot? The ideas of forgiveness and rehabilitation extended to those who have done wrong but choose a better path? Cooperation even with other with whom you may not share the same beliefs? Friendship-even in the unlikeliest of places? And how about some good old-fashioned trust faith hope and love for good measure? Im not sure what film you saw Cat. And Im sorry you didnt see the simple good-over-evil happy ending. But Id rather live in a society that makes films with these elements. And my 12 year old caught every one of them. Reply August 8 2014  by  Slim Pickens     I concur. Great action Great story Great fun. This is what movies are supposed to be. Reply August 5 2014  by  tinkbarb123     My apologies. I read your name incorrectly Rachel Cat. Above should say ""Rachel"" or ""Ms. Cat."" Although ""Cat"" does sound quite groovy. Cheers. Reply August 5 2014  by  Jamie     This movie is FUN - Marvel is really good at the fun factor huh? None of that DC brooding for them Reply August 7 2014  by  Ted Anthony     I dunno. I wanted to like this. And I liked it in a eating-lots-of-kettle-cooked-potato-chips kind of way. It hit all the right notes the ""this group must somehow form a family"" arc the ""Earths counterintuitive and rebellious youth prevails anywhere"" arc the ""we are stronger because of our differences"" arc. And certainly the actors made it come alive. But in the end it felt pro forma to me. Sure we need popcorn movies now and then and this was a fine example of the genre but somehow I wanted something a little bit less like an installment of a Flash Gordon serial with a dash of Gen-X sarcasm thrown in. Verdict a pleasant but quiet ""meh."" Reply August 22 2014  by  thebulky1     Couldnt agree more- the movie is fine but very forgettable. Reply August 7 2014  by  Christy Lemire     I totally figured you would have liked this movie more that that -- just the irreverent vibe of it alone and the way it incorporates pop culture references. Reply August 8 2014  by  Ted Anthony     It just felt like so many other things. If it was the only one of its kind I think I would have liked it more. But it felt like a bunch of Legos snapped together -- cool Legos for sure but snapped together nonetheless. Reply August 11 2014  by  scott ttocs     I must say this movie has knocked off Raiders of the lost ark as my new favorite movie. I saw raiders in the 80s. This film is just pure fun. I havent laughed at a marvel film As much as I did in this. Anyone who Doesnt like this film is just nuts. For the infinity gauntlet is a comic. next Marvel movie Is Iron Man versus Thanos. Reply August 24 2014  by  trayNTP     3 yet your piece reads as a 3.5? Reply August 28 2014  by  Dan     Just saw the movie and as a fan of the comic characters I think that they hit pretty well on translating the guardians to the screen. They placed less emphasis on Draxs true strength and Gamoras abilities (shes considered the ""deadliest woman in the galaxy"" in the comics) but its understandable given the context of the plot. That said while I definitely enjoyed it I have to agree that it was somewhat forgettable compared to the other Marvel flicks out there. I think a good reason for that is due to the fact that they didnt flesh out the universe or supporting cast. Hard for me to put into words but still an enjoyable movie that is by far the most family-friendly of any Marvel movie to date. Well see what they have in-store for us with the sequel Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

COURTESY OF DISNEY-MARVEL BY MICHAEL SRAGOW / MOVIE CRITIC Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF Guardians of the GalaxyStarring Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Dave Bautista the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel Directed by James Gunn Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and for some language Running time 2 hours 1 minute Playing In wide releaseThe quick hitNot the revolution in comic book fantasy its been cracked up to be but still an amusing light-parody treatment of superhero teams and space cowboys. Grade B- Can you make a comic epic out of a gargantuan collection of doodles? The answer provided by ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is ""not really"" but millions of comic-book fans will have a good time at it anyway. This partial send-up of superhero teams doesnt live up to its hype - that is it doesnt re-energize the comic book form from the inside out with satiric brio. It mostly grafts jokes onto the usual fantasy machinery. But it contains enough impudent cosmic and American graffiti to please Marvel Universe zealots and many initiates too. As advertised the movie unites a raffish misfit band of adventurers - human soldier of fortune Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) reformed assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) vengeful brute Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) and bounty hunters Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). The talking raccoon Rocket a result of cruel genetic and biological experiments is a bold tinkerer planner and practical joker. Groot a sentient walking tree is Rockets trusted companion and a creature of hidden talents despite a vocabulary limited to ""I am Groot."" What brings them together is the search for the Orb - as Quill says an item with a Lost Ark Maltese Falcon vibe to it. What cements their group identity as the Guardians of the Galaxy is their decision to keep the Orb out of the hands of the evil Ronan (Lee Pace) and his cybernetically enhanced female warrior Nebula (Karen Gillan) Gamoras ""sister."" (Nebula and Gamora are the adopted ultimately estranged daughters of arch-villain Thanos.) In a ""serious"" Marvel movie the filmmakers would mine Ronans radical beliefs for real-world analogies. Theyd make sure audiences would see parallels to present-day extremists in Ronans vow to stay true to his Kree peoples ancient ways and his determination to exterminate the modern culture spawned on planet Xander (whose inhabitants look just like Earthlings). In this semi-spoof what matters are the gags writer-director James Gunn and his co-writer Nicole Perlman glean from comic incongruity. Pratt is their prime asset for turning the comedy up to 11. With him playing Star-Lord you never question what Quill brings to the team a sparkling cracked esprit de corps. So why did Gunn saddle the character with a sappy introduction? We first see Quill as a child of the 1980s listening to his Walkman at the hospital where his mother is dying (her bald head suggests cancer); in whats sure to be their final talk she hands him a letter and a gift-wrapped package that his grandfather slips into his backpack. Happily for the viewers if not for his extended family hes soon whisked into space by a band of smugglers and thieves known as Ravagers. He grows up to be a first-class Ravager himself. But even as a seasoned good-bad guy nothing gets him more juiced than loading his still-working Walkman with his mothers awesome mix tape of her favorite 70s rock. It inspires him to heights of derring-do including a dance routine comparable in desperate lunacy to Naomi Watts impromptu vaudeville act for Peter Jacksons ""King Kong."" Gunns moviemaking lacks a vibrant tempo of its own but the Me Generations greatest hits never fail to give the film a lift. When Quill gets hooked on a feeling Pratt responds with the right moves - he cant help doing a trucking-like kick when he plays ""Come and Get Your Love."" As the film goes on his pop references are sometimes cringe-worthy sometimes inspired. Gunn and Bradley Coopers decision to play Rocket gruff and bitter not instantly engaging pays off as they unveil the raccoons head-to-claw rapport with Groot. Perhaps the funniest recurring bit belongs to the human dreadnought Drax a burly fighter filled with Maori-like tattoos who aims to avenge the Krees murder of his wife and daughter. ""His people are completely literal"" Rocket warns Quill; ""metaphors are gonna go right over his head."" ""Nothing goes over my head"" Drax protests. ""My reflexes are too fast. I would catch it."" Gunn doesnt provide a seductive unifying visual style but the makeup costumes and production design are always intriguing. (My favorite visual coup is a giant ancient skull thats now a mining planet where workers sift for precious brain matter.) Gunns biggest failing is his inability to make the action itself funny. His biggest virtue is developing an organic chemistry with his cast. At the beginning these Guardians of the Galaxy bond only in an ""enemy of my enemy is my friend"" sort of way. By the end theyre actually friends.

No problem.In 2007 when Marvel Studios began producing films in-house under newly anointed president Kevin Feige the rights to its best known--and most lucrative--franchises were held by other studios. So Feige started working his way down the B-list Iron Man Hulk Thor Captain America.Related Story A Somber Super Captain America The Winter Soldier Unsurprisingly the degree of difficulty of each subsequent franchise has been ascending. Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark whose self-regard is more impervious than any armor was a relatively easy sell (especially given that it was Robert Downey Jr. doing the selling). Ditto Bruce Banner and the unjolly green giant he becomes when the gamma-fueled mood takes him. But a hammer-wielding extraterrestrial Norseman? An anachronistic refugee from a World War II reel? And if those didnt pose enough of a challenge Marvels next trick was to mix them all together (with a dose of high-tech espionage) in what would turn out to be modern cinemas most profitable chemistry experiment.Which brings us to Marvels latest gamble Guardians of the Galaxy. These heroes are vastly more obscure than those of any of Marvel project to date. Plus theyre--well goofy. A muscled maniac covered with decorative scars and a sultry alien assassin may be par for the course. But the Earthling abducted as a boy by interstellar pirates? The ambulatory tree capable of uttering only the phrase ""I am Groot""? The talking raccoon?Throw in an unfocused script that features too many half-explained locations a boggling array of alliances and counter-alliances among peripheral characters and a primary villain almost completely devoid of charisma or subtlety and the result ought to be a cosmic disaster.Yet remarkably its not. Guardians of the Galaxy may be a bit of a mess but its an extremely good-natured mess full of humor and even tenderness. Perhaps more surprising still its the very elements that seemed most likely to ruin the film--e.g. the tree-man the raccoon--that account for much of its improbable charm.The giddy picaresque space opera opens quietly in the 1980s with a young boy visiting his cancer-stricken mother in the hospital. (Warning This scene may prove a bit much for the kids. It may also prove a bit much for any grownups who like me are susceptible to heartbreaking appropriations of 10ccs seminal ""Im Not in Love."") Mom asks him why hes been fighting with other boys. ""They killed a little frog that didnt do nothin"" he tells her between tears. Moments later after the boy has fled his mothers deathbed and the hospital itself an alien warship drops out of the night sky and scoops him up.Between the talking raccoon and the unfocused script the movie ought to be a cosmic disaster.Fast forward 26 years and were reintroduced to this gentle soul as an adult played by Chris Pratt. Named Peter Quill--but trying very hard (and with very little success) to adopt the sobriquet ""Starlord""--hes now a space bandit burgling the ruins of a desolate planet for an alien orb. Quill manages the theft though complications ensue. No sooner does he return to civilization than he finds himself targeted by a pretty chartreuse-hued killer named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) on the one hand and a sentient raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his extraterrestrial Ent bodyguard Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) on the other. After tussling briefly over the orb all four find themselves in a vast intergalactic prison where they eventually ally themselves with an immense and irony-free bruiser named Drax (wrestler Dave Bautista). Following an elaborately entertaining prison-break the newly minted quintet...Well I wont reveal the rest of the plot in part because I dont think I could if I tried. Suffice to say that the alien orb is one of the half-dozen ""infinity stones"" with which the unfolding Marvel-verse is increasingly concerned (the Tesseract and the Aether are the two others introduced to date) and pretty much everyone in the film is trying so hard to get his or her hands on it that it might as well be the Maltese Falcon or Ark of the Covenant. Principal baddie Ronan (Lee Pace) wants the orb so that he can trade it to Thanos (a brief performance-capture appearance by Josh Brolin) in exchange for the latter destroying the home world of his sworn enemies the Xandarians (who count among them characters played by John C. Reilly and Glenn Close). The Collector (Benicio del Toro) wants it because he already picked up one infinity stone in Thor The Dark World and--obviously--because he collects stuff. And Pratts prickly father-figure and erstwhile kidnapper the marauder Yondu (played with blue-skinned relish by Michael Rooker) wants it because its worth a lot of money. Complicating matters still further Gamora who is the adopted daughter of Thanos initially wants the orb too--though whether to placate or to betray Thanos (and by extension Ronan) is unclear. She also has another adopted sister Nebula whos in a similarly uncertain motivational boat.Got all that? Of course you didnt. But happily it hardly matters. Yes it would be nice if Guardians of the Galaxy had a script in which the pieces fit as neatly as in The Avengers or Captain American The Winter Soldier. But in place of narrative cohesion the movie instead offers substantial helpings of wit and warmth. Pratt may not have a typical brand of movie star charisma but he radiates likability in the central role of Quill. (Pratt has described the part as ""Han Solo meets Marty McFly"" but it also contains a substantial dose of Emmet the accidental hero he voiced in The Lego Movie.) Saldana for her part continues to expand the sci-fi hegemony shed already established in Avatar and the Star Trek movies. Bautista is solid (in multiple senses of the word) and Diesel brings surprising nuance to Groots oft-repeated catchphrase.In place of narrative cohesion the movie instead offers substantial helpings of wit and warmth.And Rocket the raccoon? If theres anything that could have utterly derailed the movie its a tough-talking varmint with ""genetic and cybernetic enhancements."" But Cooper does an excellent job of channeling the feisty patter of undersized tough guys from James Cagney to Joe Pesci. And as far as this summers CGI marvels go Rocket is second only to last months exquisite apes.Our heroes bounce haphazardly across the cosmos from the Kyln prison to Knowhere (the hollow skull of an intergalactic giant still being mined for any last scrapings of alien cerebrum) to the Dark Aster (Ronans asteroid-sized dreadnought) to Xandar (the besieged home planet of the Xandarians and their defenders the Nova Corps). And while none of it makes a great deal of sense director James Gunn (Slither Super) keeps things moving at a heady pace along the way offering up gags about Jackson Pollock Ranger Rick Bonnie and Clyde John Stamos and most memorably the original Footloose.If theres one element that (very loosely) knits these manic lightweight proceedings together its Quills attachment to his beloved boyhood Walkman and the ""Awesome Mix Vol. 1"" cassette it contains. The tracks on the latter which make up much of the movies nostalgia-driven soundtrack include such period classics as ""Hooked on a Feeling"" ""Spirit in the Sky"" ""Cherry Bomb"" and ""O-o-h Child."" It is in fact a genuinely awesome mix. And in part as a result Guardians of the Galaxy despite substantial flaws of logic and storytelling is a pretty awesome movie.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

At the end of 2013 in the low-slung industrial Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung a bevy of officials came to attend the ribbon cutting of a huge former hotel that had undergone a top-to-bottom multimillion-dollar renovation. Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award.

Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting. ""In what comes as close to a smoking gun as we are likely to see in modern times the States very justification for a challenged statute hinges explicitly on race--specifically its concern that African Americans who had overwhelmingly voted for Democrats had too much access to the franchise"" wrote Judge Diana Gribbon Motz.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion. Continue Reading Channel 4 The Prescience of Brass Eye 15 Years Later David Sims Chris Morriss brutal satire aired its last and most controversial episode in 2001 but its skewering of the news media feels more relevant than ever. A sex offender is thrown in the stocks presented with a small child and asked if he wants to molest him. A mob of protestors is thrown a ""dummy full of guts"" that is stomped to pieces within seconds. A radio host insists that pedophiles have ""more genes in common with crabs"" than the rest of humanity insisting ""Theres no real evidence for [that] but it is scientific fact."" Its hard to pinpoint the most cringe-inducing moment on ""Paedogeddon"" a special episode of the British TV satire Brass Eye. But 15 years after the episode aired it remains a totemic terrifying satirical vision. Few comedies since have dared to cross the boundaries of taste with such impunity. ""Paedogeddon"" aired in the U.K. in the summer of 2001 a year after the murder of a young girl had sparked national hysteria over the countrys sex-offender registry. Britains most-read newspaper led a campaign to publish the names and locations of all 110000 convicted sex offenders prompting a riot in which an angry mob ransacked the home of an ex-con. Brass Eye a parody of a 60 Minutes-like newsmagazine show had been dormant after airing one season in the UK in 1997. But it returned four years later for this surprise broadcast one that saw its furious (fictional) anchors barking from a dark studio about the plague of seemingly super-powered child molesters stalking the nation holding a funhouse mirror up to the climate of paranoia and fear that had built up around the country. It was a bold wildly insensitive piece of comedy but one that captured the growing madness of the 24-hour news media and foreshadowed some uglier aspects of its future.

Almost everyone has something they want to change about their personality. In 2014 a study that traced peoples goals for personality change found that the vast majority of its subjects wanted to be more extraverted agreeable emotionally stable and open to new experiences. A whopping 97 percent said they wished they were more conscientious. These desires appeared to be rooted in dissatisfaction. People wanted to become more extraverted if they werent happy with their sex lives hobbies or friendships. They wanted to become more conscientious if they were displeased with their finances or schoolwork. The findings reflect the social psychologist Roy Baumeisters notion of ""crystallization of discontent"" Once people begin to recognize larger patterns of shortcomings in their lives he contends they may reshuffle their core values and priorities to justify improving things.

"I Feel Groot << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Van Gaalogy 101  Next A Bengal Under Pressure Facebook Twitter Print Movies I Feel Groot When James Brown makes you happy and Guardians of the Galaxy sends you over the moon by Wesley Morris on August 1 2014 Is there such a thing as state-of-the-art lip-syncing? Because Ive never seen anything like what Chadwick Boseman does as James Brown in Get on Up. By the time the movie gets to Browns aerobic 1971 Paris show -- which he does here in a onesie whose top is just a vest -- youre no longer watching an actor mouth ""Soul Power."" Youre watching the words torpedo from his mouth. Its an electric magic trick a soaking-wet performer understanding that the key to the illusion to transcending mere impersonation is wedding Browns passion to precision. If something goes just a hair wrong the arrow misses the apple and lands in somebodys head. Boseman speaks in a version of Browns charred country husk risking intelligibility for accuracy. There were moments when I only kind of caught what he said. While Brown could belt he could also mumble. But the singings a different story. That voice was a weapon of art. Whod be dumb enough to try to imitate it? For the first song or two youre skeptical of the fake-it approach. But then Bosemans Brown takes the stage at a Georgia juke joint in the mid-1950s and its clear that whatever hes doing with this performance has started to work. Little Richard (Brandon Smith whos very good) exits -- or rather given the bitchy oracle he is here goes poof Then Brown and his bandmates sneak on after him and do the old jump-blues classic ""Caldonia."" The camera gets right up in Bosemans face so you can take it all in the sweat and the straining and the shuffling around a tiny stage. The sex basically. Boseman probably overdoes the unself-consciously ugly expressions Brown made when he performed but thats what pulls you through the looking glass It hurts to be this good. For this performance to work you have to believe that the man strutting around and doing the kicks and splits and falling down on one knee is the same cat whose interjections are exploding off the screen amid the music. You have to see strain in his face and lips and muscles. The timing of the syncing and the illusion of live singing have to combine to feel real. You have to be able to look into Bosemans face and feel as you could with James Brown that what youre seeing and hearing is glorious and obscene and original the radical ripping rasp of a voice. Brown didnt jive or play black for a white audience. That was the shock of his talent Unlike Sam Cooke and Ray Charles he never adulterated it. The voice was one-size-fits-all. He had a raw irreducible wail whose volume and vibrato he could control. What was ironically exhilarating about him of course was that he rehearsed obsessively in order to master seeming like a preacher on fire. He was also multiorgasmic. Brown was always. About. To. Come. Hed bend down on one knee and receive the cape from his forever sideman Bobby Byrd seeming spent only to whip around ready to go again. All night. Whether the songs lasted two minutes or 10 they too were all ready to go all night. Get on Up lasts 138 minutes and as good as Boseman and a dozen other actors are I dont think I could have lasted a minute more. Brown was an exhausting entertainer. This is exhaustive entertainment. The cliches wear you out -- recording sessions hit songs women babies childhood flashbacks highs lows hair (so much fried hair) arguments makeups somebody saying ""I cant do this anymore."" So does the fact that the filmmakers dont know what to make of Browns contradictions -- his conservatism and progressiveness his abstemiousness and indulgence his appreciation for and abuse of women his drill-sergeant bandleadership and his soldier-on-furlough ways. Theres too much jumping across time too much of Brown speaking right into the camera. Why on earth sit through a fictional film of his life -- especially one as fictional as this -- when there are at least half a dozen documentaries that can give you exactly what you need? The screenwriters are the English brothers Jez and John-Henry Butterworth (and Mick Jagger is the producer). If you didnt know these two also wrote Edge of Tomorrow you could tell by the slippery approach to time and the small-but-unstoppable larger-than-life protagonist. The first batch of scenes in Get on Up move explosively around the decades from Brown prowling the bowels of the Omni Coliseum in the mid-1990s; to that time in 1988 when he took a shotgun to a strip mall; to him and the J.B.s under Vietcong fire in a U.S. plane in 1968; to him looking into the camera and asking us ""You ready?"" after which comes a fireball that whisks us to 1939 and the one-room shack that once was his home. The movie wants to offer Brown as a self-made force of nature who made his own weather. He started as a nothing who quit school in seventh grade and became an impervious industry. ""I can never quit when it gets hard"" he says at some point. ""I goes forward ... I live."" All this leaping across time begins more or less with that shotgun incident. Its not an auspicious raising of the curtain. Brown pulls up to his office in Augusta disoriented -- officially he was high on PCP. He deduces that someone attending the insurance seminar in the adjoining office has used his personal bathroom the one with a gold record on the wall. Greatly upset he interrupts the session terrifies the attendees blasts a hole in the ceiling and zeroes in on the mortified culprit. He talks gibberish. Its a crude introduction that should make fans of half-baked black-male characters feel right at home. Yeah we very much know this is James Brown. But the movie is content to present him as a crazy old Negro with a shotgun. This is hardly an unconventional approach to movie biography. Close your eyes and it could be Why Do Fools Fall in Love or Ray the presentation of contradictions of a stars brilliance and decline. But Get on Ups digressions can be compelling. When Brown loses the thread of his rant at that seminar its because hallucinations of his own screaming and rhythm section cloud over him. This wont be the last daydream he has. But Get on Up isnt a movie about structural fantastical narrative. Its not about how James Brown wound up stoned and armed in a tracksuit or the ensuing car chase and subsequent arrests. The scenes are cuts on a greatest-hits collection. Remember the time when JB flew his Learjet to meet President Johnson? What about the legendary Boston Garden show Brown put on the night after Martin Luther King Jr.s assassination? After almost two hours the film implies that the spur for the insurance-seminar incident is grief over his son Teddy who died 15 years earlier. This bit isnt unobjectionable. It more or less happened. Its just misguided. The Butterworths and the movies director Tate Taylor are up to something interesting. Theyre trying to represent Browns psyche. They put the movie in his voice and imagine the story from his point of view. When hes pantomiming ""I Feel Good"" with his Famous Flames on the all-white studio set of 1965s Frankie Avalon-Dwayne Hickman vehicle Ski Party the track starts to warp. He surveys the white faces and the snowflake cardigan hes got on and fantasizes about being half-dressed and sweaty onstage draped in black women. But the self-consciousness goes too far. We see him smack his second wife DeeDee Jenkins (Jill Scott) across the kitchen. Well the slap occurs offscreen. We see her crash into a table as he walks toward the camera and glowers at us. Is this a movie about House of Cards Frank Underwood or the Godfather of Soul? The emotional hook is the friendship between Brown and Byrd whos played with easy memorable warmth by Nelsan Ellis. The movie even cooks up a scenario in which Byrds gospel group (the Starlighters) comes to the prison where a teenage Brown is serving five-to-13 for petty theft and the two men fall in musical love. Byrd tried to remain devoted to Brown after the players in the J.B.s demanded payment and time off and Brown fired them -- bye Maceo Parker (Craig Robinson); bye Pee Wee Ellis (Tariq ""Black Thought"" Trotter). Brown was the Proud Mary of self-made music icons He never did anything nice and easy. Taylor sends a lot of movie at you. Theres a flashback that feels lifted from Ralph Ellisons Invisible Man. Theres a very funny cut into the audience at a live show where in one shot Scott is mildly turned on and in the next shes fully wildly aroused and drenched in sweat. Often Taylor is throwing at us the cast of his previous film The Help. Viola Davis plays Browns abandoning mother. Octavia Spencer is the aunt who puts Little Junior as hes called to work routing men to her brothel. Allison Janney Aunjanue Ellis and Ahna OReilly are also here Janney for one of the dumbest cutaways in the movie. The Help was a moral mess Black women need white women to help lift them up. Get on Up would seem to be a corrective If a white hand tries to help Brown he smacks it. The movie is sure to point out that he knew the racial score that powerful whites would exploit blacks when they could and that black people had to have the dignity ambition and belief to empower themselves. Brown was serious about that and the movie almost gives that seriousness its due. After some of the black crowd rushes the stage at that Garden show Brown turns ruminatively cross wondering aloud whats going on. ""Either we together or we aint."" He was in a sociopolitical bind between black radicals who thought he was just a capitalist and whites who suspected he had the power to start riots. On his way to meet Johnson he tells his manager Ben Bart (Dan Aykroyd) ""Im just a soul brother whining on his private jet."" You laugh at the line and then not much later there he is in a recording studio wearing an Afro and dashiki surrounded by children who belt ""Say it loud -- Im black and Im proud"" This movie is the opposite of The Help. Brown wanted African Americans lifting themselves up. He was an elevator. For a few years biographical moviemaking had been taking a single angle on a subject or it applied parameters. The scripts of Peter Morgan -- The Queen Frost/Nixon The Damned United Rush -- were character studies set against specific moments in history. Lincoln was about a president and the agonizing ecstasy of the legislative process. Walk the Line reconsidered Johnny Cashs life as a romantic drama with his wife June. These movies are windows onto icons. There are too many windows in Get on Up. It quite easily could have been a movie about that night at the Garden about a real test of a mans character of a citys and by extension a nations. There are too many Browns for any one film to get a proper handle on who he was. The results here are both psychologically keen and presumptuous (mostly with regard to his mother and his sexuality) but fragmentary too. The story is of a man so full of himself -- and so full of selves -- that he was practically a nesting doll. That of course leaves the filmmakers to rely on Boseman for coherence. His challenge is to keep you from thinking about Eddie Murphys hot tub impersonation from sensing only an outsize joke. He has to find a way to take you past caricature and into characterization. This movie gives Boseman a much clearer shot at that than did last years Jackie Robinson movie 42 which was more about the courageous effrontery of Branch Rickey than it was about Robinson and Wendell Smith the black journalist who was effectively Robinsons minder. Boseman has a wide serious-looking face. The hair and makeup artists here try not to overdo it. When Davis drops by Browns dressing room her droopy face rhymes with his. Boseman is pliably handsome enough that he can keep playing the great Negroes of the last 100 years -- James Baldwin should be next. But he has given Robinson and now Brown enough different charisma for him not to be just a paper doll. With Robinson he played stoicism. With Brown hes playing everything else. Theres a long rehearsal sequence for ""Cold Sweat"" in which Browns manic punitive genius surfaces and another scene after the band quits in which his paranoid self-aggrandizement takes over. But Boseman is most alive when it seems that Browns singing voice is his own. It never seems more so than when he stands stock-still in an arena and does ""Try Me."" Its a lie of course. But such is Browns everlasting artistry and Bosemans interpretation of it that youre momentarily certain its true. Tis the season for monosyllabic trees. They shoot drive grunt and play guys named Dom Toretto and Richard Riddick. Rarely though are they actual trees. Guardians of the Galaxy dares to toss into the ensemble a stalk of braided twigs and limbs. His name is Groot hes got eyes that take on more water than a leaky boat and his voice boldly enough belongs to that summer sequoia Vin Diesel who speaks his one line (""I am Groot"") about 10 different ways. The character himself comes from a computer. As for the actor Wood has never sounded more elastic. Thats merely one of half a dozen miracles the movie has to offer. It hails from the Marvel comic-book universe but it may as well have wafted from a genies lamp. Like so many other movies with spaceships and dark lords and cute white cosmically charmed heroes this too is a space opera. Loosely the plot forces mercenaries to band together to stop an orb from falling into the sort of wrong hands that will twist it open and obliterate the universe. But its conducted with the sort of high spirits that usually evaporate in so-called superhero movies. The director doesnt come from Hollywood action or big-time television. James Gunn comes from the most entertaining Avenger of all the Toxic one. He did time at the counter-artistic schlock house Troma Entertainment and brings to this new movie that studios exciting load of crap a planet thats just a giant floating head; a badass raccoon who brings down the house with Bradley Coopers American Hustle accent and whose sidekick is that tree; Benicio Del Toro as a mad scientist who looks like Bea Arthur and Jim Jarmusch serving a life sentence as Ricardo Montalban in The Wrath of Khan. So absent are the ponderousness and world-stabilizing dreariness of so many comic-book movies that for long stretches Guardians plays like a parody of the genre. But in banishing self-seriousness it harbors a reverence for the joys of fantasy. The cute white guy is Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a strapping nimrod orphan who as a boy was sucked up into outer space and now as a thirtysomething man is a junker trolling the galaxy for treasure -- one of the Goonies grown up with delusions of Han Solo. (To the bafflement of many Quill wants to be called Star-Lord.) Hes after the orb. So are Rocket and Groot. But so is Gamora (Zoe Saldana) a green-skinned assassin whos been sent for the treasure but chose instead to defect from her familys evil galactic dynasty. When these four square off for possession of the ball in a multilevel public space the camerawork and choreography have a jaw-dropping elegance. Each participant winds up with the orb only to be stripped of it Its like watching a Looney Tunes pinball ballet. Technology has evolved so that everything seems possible and a sequence like this stands out because its simultaneously nothing special and extraordinary at the same time. The trick for the audience is succumbing to the trickery. Over and over in this movie you do. At some point one of the digital characters pops his eyes and throws his hands over his mouth in appalled shock and without realizing it so did I Who thought to add such a hilariously human grace note? That chase for the orb lands those four in prison where Drax (professional wrestler Dave Bautista) a bald colossus with scarlet embossing on his skin gets a load of Gamora and rather than finding her hot wants to kill her. Shes a member of the race that murdered his wife and daughter. Some good writing by Gunn and Nicole Perlman keeps the five of them bickering until their only moral option is to become a team and stop the dastardly Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) from getting the orb and destroying the planet Xandar. The 1970s hits on Peters mixtape provide the movie with its soundtrack and half of them I could have lived without. Gunn is too original to ape Quentin Tarantino. (Of course the last couple of songs promise that Volume 2 of the collection might be something to hear.) Peoples reactions to this music were giddy the day I saw the film. Maybe the songs in a movie context were new to them and even I have to confess to finding the triumphal heroes-walking-in-slo-mo-down-the-hall a hoot. These guys stroll as ""Cherry Bomb"" plays which is less amusing than the sight of a digital raccoon adjusting his crotch and Saldana not bothering to stifle a yawn. In the bad version of this movie thats film criticism. Heres its jackassery. I do wish there had been a way to give Djimon Hounsou more to play than another Caliban part but theres his character glued to Ronans side. Still I love the way the starships swing into park. I love that theres a place called Xandar and that its overseen by something called the Nova Empire and that the president Nova Prime is played by Glenn Close as her First Lady from Mars Attacks I love the way Pace really enunciates his lines as though every syllable has the power to murder a teddy bear. And Bautistas soulful humorous humorlessness might be the happiest surprise of all. Ive seen him ""act"" on TVs Raw and have wanted to call ""timber."" But here hes something like a brute-comedian. The script wont get the credit it deserves for its humor and economy. But the movies terms are navigable for an adult and if youre 9 or 10 and confounded Im guessing theres a thrill in the confusion I will figure this out The trouble with what George Lucas has done to the movies is that so many writers and directors and companies have learned the wrong lessons. Theyre building myths and monuments and worlds. But theyre not having any fun. Guardians is the first movie since Mel Brookss Spaceballs to understand that the Star Wars movies were also comedies. Gunn is a lot more playful than Lucas and hes not a priceless cynic like Brooks. This is the sort of the movie that men like Zack Snyder want to make but lack the gravity-free touch to put together. Gunn appears to remember the high of certain kinds of moviegoing where when the credits are over all you want to do is get back in line and enjoy the whole thing again. Hes made that kind of adventure one of the few that inspire you to do as its studio commands Marvel.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A crew of interplanetary misfits must stop a tyrant from taking over the cosmos. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. BOTTOM LINE ""Pulp Fiction"" meets ""Star Wars"" in this rock-driven tongue-in-cheek space-opera. Refreshingly smart and funny. CAST Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Dave Bautista Bradley Cooper LENGTH 202 What does it say about superhero movies that the best one this year features a talking tree and a gunslinging raccoon? Competition hasnt exactly been fierce as ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" so drearily proved. But ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" a smart fresh funny new entry from Marvel and Disney shows that theres still life in this universe. Though based on a comics series launched in 1969 ""Guardians"" comes on with a hip absurdist humor that feels thoroughly modern. Its heroes are an outlandish parody of the proverbial motley crew Along with the ever-growing tree Groot (the limited voice of Vin Diesel) and the hostile raccoon Rocket (a snarlingly good Bradley Cooper) there are Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista a pro wrestler revealing a gift for deadpan delivery) the green-skinned ""living weapon"" Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and the relatively normal Peter Quill (Chris Pratt). Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Who was the Sons of Anarchy Homeless Woman? Quill a former Earthling is our main protagonist and Pratt (""The Lego Movie"") invites us to step right into him. Hes an appealing combination of smooth moves and blunders cockiness and cowardice an overgrown kid desperate to be known galaxy-wide as Star Lord. His backstory outlined in a surprisingly emotional opening sequence gives him a wounded heart and more important a treasured cassette tape. That explains why this sci-fi-fantasy film grooves to a soundtrack of pop-rock nuggets like Blue Swedes ""Hooked on a Feeling"" and Redbones ""Come and Get Your Love."" It matters little that Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) needs the Infinity Stone to conquer the cosmos; in this movie the serious moments last mere seconds to make more room for freewheeling action snappy dialogue and interspecies Abbott and Costello routines (Drax for instance is genetically incapable of metaphor). Among the colorful support cast are Michael Rooker (AMCs ""The Walking Dead"") as the outlaw Yondu; a fey Benicio Del Toro as The Collector and Glenn Close whose benevolent Nova Prime vaguely resembles Leslie Nielsen in ""Airplane"" Director James Gunn (""Super"") who co-wrote with Nicole Perlman adroitly mixes big-budget spectacle with screwball comedy giving a much-needed goose to a self-serious genre. It ends with a sentence that normally wouldnt bode well for a superhero movie ""The Guardians of the Galaxy will return."" 147 MoviesRafers review Guardians of the Galaxy _____ advertisement | advertise on newsday PLOT A crew of interplanetary misfits must stop a tyrant from taking over the cosmos.

"Guardians of the Galaxy and The Zero Theorem reviews | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesGuardians of the Galaxy and The Zero Theorem reviewsEclectic new sci-fi movies Guardians of the Galaxy and The Zero Theorem strive to spin gold out of dross with their patchwork characters and plots. Only one really succeeds.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. July 31 2014Guardians of the GalaxyStarring Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Bradley Cooper Vin Diesel and Dave Bautista. Directed by James Gunn. At GTA theatres. 122 minutes. PGThe Zero TheoremArticle Continued BelowStarring Christoph Waltz Tilda Swinton David Thewlis Melanie Thierry and Matt Damon. Directed by Terry Gilliam. At the Royal. 107 minutes. 14AFrom left Zoe Saldana the character Rocket Racoon voiced by Bradley Cooper Chris Pratt the character Groot voiced by Vin Diesel and Dave Bautista in a scene from Guardians of the Galaxy.  (DISNEY / MARVEL)  Christoph Waltz as Qohen Leth in a scene from The Zero Theorem.  (MONGREL MEDIA)  What do you do when you have a bunch of leftover characters and ideas and you want to make a movie out of them perhaps even a franchise?If youre Marvel Comics or Monty Pythons Terry Gilliam you make Guardians of the Galaxy and The Zero Theorem two sci-fi films arriving in Toronto theatres Friday. They strive to spin gold out of dross by pulling together shiny spare parts; only one really succeeds.The first and better of these junkyard adventures the wide-opening Guardians of the Galaxy is the one with franchise ambitions.Which it will likely attain -- there are already plans for a sequel -- because the characters are great and the movie is often very funny. But you have to hope that Marvel gets away from using leftover stories too.From left Zoe Saldana the character Rocket Racoon voiced by Bradley Cooper Chris Pratt the character Groot voiced by Vin Diesel and Dave Bautista in a scene from Guardians of the Galaxy.  (DISNEY / MARVEL)  Christoph Waltz as Qohen Leth in a scene from The Zero Theorem.  (MONGREL MEDIA)  These Guardians are a motley crew of celestial badasses and smartasses giant grunting tree Groot voiced by Vin Diesel; sarcastic mutant varmint Rocket Raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper; pompous tattooed strongman Drax played by WWE strongman Dave Bautista; and green-skinned ninja Gamora played by Zoe Saldana.The fifth member of the group is the only recognizably human one Chris Pratts treasure raider Peter Quill a.k.a. Star-Lord who was abducted as a child by space scavengers who also inducted him into their mercenary business.With the exception of Groot a character dating back to the late 1950s all of the Guardians are Marvel Comics creations from the 1970s. This could explain the films obsession with 70s pop tunes like Blue Swedes ""Hooked On A Feeling"" on a cassette mix tape that Quill holds dear and which he plays on an ancient Sony Walkman.The five Guardians all have their own attitudes and agendas none of which draws them voluntarily together. But fate -- in the form of an all-powerful orb that could destroy the universe -- forces them to work together for the greater good or the lesser bad whichever comes first and easiest.Heres where director James Gunn (Super) and his co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman fumble the orb just a little bit because its just the same-old same-old sci-fi staple of a cataclysmic MacGuffin being fought over by celestial freaks.And there are way too many freaks jammed into the film which runs long at just over two hours and explodes stuff to the point of numbness. The main villain is the Phantom Menace-hooded Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) who takes life a lot more seriously than the Guardians do.He wants that orb dammit so he can blow up a bunch of planets and then rule whats left of the galaxy. Hes like the Nazis seeking the Ark of the Covenant in Raiders of the Lost Ark a movie Guardians gleefully pillages along with Star Wars Galaxy Quest Serenity and any number of other sci-fi spectacles of the past century.The film really does seem like a dumping ground of recycled ideas which I suppose is part of the joke. When one of your cosmic hangouts is called ""Knowhere"" youre not aiming to outdo the space visions of Kubrick or Tarkovsky.""I dont learn"" Quill quips knowingly at one point. ""One of my issues.""But you can forgive the lack of narrative novelty because the main characters seem so fresh even if they are all castoffs. They make for quite the entertaining eyeful together on the screen.Groot and Rocket Raccoon are the instant attractions doing a celestial Mutt and Jeff or Laurel and Hardy routine that manages to be both cynical and sincere at the same time. Expect many Groot and Rocket admirers on the streets this Halloween.Pratt is the big revelation though. Hes paid his dues playing the comic sidekick opposite bigger stars in many other movies and also TVs Parks and Recreation but hes got the chops for action hero status of the Han Solo or Indiana Jones wise guy variety.He demonstrated his lead character potential earlier this year in The LEGO Movie which Guardians of the Galaxy also resembles come to think of it. Except the patchwork characters and story of LEGO were by design whereas Guardians seems more like a series of happy accidents -- but happy all the same.The same cant exactly be said of Terry Gilliams The Zero Theorem which the film director and Python animator calls the final part of his ""Orwellian Trilogy"" which began with Brazil and Twelve Monkeys.Already out on DVD its opening only at the Royal and almost escaped getting any kind of Canadian theatrical release had not Gilliam personally intervened.With Pat Rushin scripting and a hairless Christoph Waltz leading its more of the usual Gilliam compost heap of extravagant visuals and dystopic sentiments set this time in a near-future London ruled by computers and a soulless corporation called Mancom.Waltz is an Orwellian tech drone named Qohen although his supervisor (David Thewlis) keeps calling him ""Quinn"" in a joke that doesnt work the first time and is repeated incessantly.Qohen is searching for the Zero Theorem a mathematical formula that may not exist but if it does could provide the answer to life the universe and everything (paging the ghost of Douglas Adams).Perpetually sad not enjoying himself at all our anti-hero works inside an abandoned old church that really does look like a junkyard. Management (Matt Damon) tries to keep him going by sending along a daffy shrink (Tilda Swinton) a teasing sex worker (Melanie Thierry) and an obnoxious teen computer whiz (Moonrise Kingdoms Lucas Hedges).As usual with Gilliams films the production is more delightful to behold than to parse. Sight gags abound such as a party scene where participants remain plugged into their smartphones rather than communing in person. Theres a real sense of melancholy in the film a lament that we have all been too eager to trade the human realm for the virtual one.But despite stellar work from his actors and with Gilliam making the most of an obviously limited budget its hard not to think of the film itself when Thewlis cynically tells Waltz ""Everything adds up to nothing. Thats the point.""The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    21degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 425pm on Thursday Jul. 31 2014 Thursday Jul. 31 2014 Thursday Jul. 31 2014 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram They got me with Go All the Way. Guardians of the Galaxy the latest Marvel comic and marketing monster to make the leap from the page to the screen is the kind of movie that will have fans rehashing the one-liners and parade of visual gags through at least Labor Day. The most absurdly tongue-in-cheek of all the superhero movies it makes The Avengers look like Schindlers List.And just when it seems as if this goof of a movie is going to spiral down a rabbit-hole of pop-culture conceits the filmmakers do something to bring a smile -- like playing the Raspberries gloriously effervescent 1972 hit Go All the Wayon the soundtrack.Likable Chris Pratt is Peter Quill a rogue and scavenger in a galaxy far far away. Kidnapped from Earth in the late 80s while still a kid -- clutching his Sony Walkman with a tape of 70s hits given to him by his mother before she died -- Quill has grown into a rapscallion with a fondness for a music no one in this part of the universe knows a thing about.While on a mission to track down a mysterious orb that could bring him a small fortune Quill finds himself in the middle of a galactic space hunt. Everyone wants this object especially the evil Ronan (Lee Pace) who wants to (what else?) rule the universe his warring warrior daughters Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) and some strange guy who just goes by the name of The Collector (Benicio del Toro).Meanwhile others are chasing Peter including a wisecracking raccoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) his less glib talking-tree sidekick Groot (Vin Diesel) and the band of mercenaries led by Yondu (Michael Rooker) who snatched him from Earth in the first place.To cut a 121-minute-long story short Quill Gamora Rocket Groot and Drax (wrestler Dave Bautista) a prisoner they pick up along the way end up on the same side as the only force standing between freedom and tyranny.As directed by James Gunn -- who has only done smaller movies like Slither and Super before this -- Guardians of the Galaxy never takes itself seriously and its often a visual and musical treat. The Runaways Cherry Bomb and David Bowies Moonage Daydream? Yes please.While the films core demographic will respond to the jokey camaraderie and special effects its their parents and grandparents who will be downloading the soundtrack.Yet for all of that the film begins to run out of steam in its second half as like with so many superhero movies things start to go kaboom and it becomes more like the films it had been slyly parodying.But then they go and toss in the 5 Stairsteps forgotten but blissfully hopeful 1970 track Ooh Child and the realization dawns that like other songs of that era often declared everythings gonna be all right.

Photo/Video Walt Disney Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com July 31 2014 314 p.m. ET 2 COMMENTS The distinguishing mark of Marvels ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is its pleasing silliness. If these goofballs are our guardians the galaxys future may be iffy but its present is laughy. This action spectacular in not-so-spectacular 3-D announces its tone early on when the hero Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) ventures into a vast crepuscular chamber on a Godforsaken planet and firing up his cherished cassette Walkman breaks into a little dance thats charmingly retro and cheerfully absurd. The message could not be clearer or more inviting. Abandon all mope ye who enter here. More Reviews Get On Up Calvary In the grand scheme of things--Marvel things not merely galactic things--""Guardians"" is a likable lightweight though its heavy enough on cosmic combat and dazzling effects. (Exceedingly heavy at times when visual clutter defeats comedy.) A first salvo in a new franchise based on a relatively obscure comics series the film stars a relatively unfamous actor (Mr. Pratt is best known for playing Andy Dwyer on televisions ""Parks and Recreation"") and surrounds the self-ironic Peter with a team of rebellious misfits he meets in prison. They include Rocket a weapons-savvy raccoon given voice by Bradley Cooper; Dave Bautistas vengeful Drax whos stronger of body than mind (he cant grasp metaphors); and Groot a sentient tree who is voiced in a manner of speaking by Vin Diesel. (Groots manner of speaking limits him to saying ""Im Groot"" which he does frequently getting laughs with each repetition.) Zoe Saldanas Gamora isnt funny and isnt supposed to be; shes an alluringly athletic warrior with initially ambiguous motives. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was directed by James Gunn from a script he wrote with Nicole Perlman. Like the movies star its director was an adventurous choice for a megabudget space opera and a smart one; his moviemaking background is rich in oddity and his most prominent feature until now was the horror comedy ""Slither."" Mr. Gunn gives this production a free-swinging style you want to root for just as Marvel fans will be rooting for Peter Quill a half-human who likes to call himself Star-Lord after Peter swipes a mysteriously powerful orb and becomes the object of a manhunt led by the villainous Ronan the Accuser. (The cast includes Michael Rooker Djimon Hounsou John C. Reilly Glenn Close and Benicio Del Toro. The production was designed by Charles Wood and photographed by Ben Davis.) The people who made this movie must have had a swell time in the process and its nice to see a summer epic that takes itself so unseriously. Eventually the wink-and-nod whimsicality wears thin and you wonder how this errant gang is going to keep its antics fresh in subsequent episodes. For now though Marvel has maintained its standards in the action department--cluttered or not the screen is alive with marvelous images--and has won a crucial gamble on its star. Peter is not only a good man playing outlaw; he is as played by Mr. Pratt a good guy and a quintessentially amiable American hero. ""I couldnt let you die"" he tells Gamora after saving her life. ""I found something inside myself incredibly heroic--not to brag."" The disclaimer isnt needed. We get that Peter enjoys himself so were up for enjoying him. Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download ENLARGE Star Trek (2009) Not a lot of comedy or whimsicality here but J.J. Abramss film goes back to the legends roots with a boldness that brought a fatigued franchise back to life. It feels exactly right that Capt. Kirk should have been a rebellious Iowa farm boy with a passion for antique cars a gnawing sense of purpose and a penchant as the new movie soon reveals for barroom brawls. It also feels right that hes played as a young man by an appealing actor Chris Pine who bears a more-than-passing facial resemblance to Montgomery Clift.

August 1 2014 -- 1206pm Disney/Marvel Chris Pratt plays Peter Quill (aka Star Lord) in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" which follows the plot of many a Marvel comics film but departs from the formula. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert A highly combustible mix of space opera and camp comedy ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" explores a corner of the Marvel comics universe inhabited by rocket-riding reprobates rather than superheroes. It extends the brand into a realm of buffoonish antiheroes frankly raunchy humor and unabashed absurdism. What sounds like a strained miscalculation turns out to be one of the most shamelessly enjoyable pranks ever pulled by a multibillion-dollar entertainment conglomerate. This is what happens when blockbuster filmmaking sits on a whoopee cushion. The film is crammed with fun though you wouldnt predict that from the setup a 1988 curtain-raiser about a frightened kid and his cancer-ravaged widowed mother. Hes young Peter Quill (touchingly played by Wyatt Oleff) and his plight simply breaks your heart. But hes soon whisked into a world of fantastical escapism by the Ravagers space pirates who abduct him for reasons that are initially mysterious. Jump ahead a couple of decades and into the far reaches of the cosmos where adult Peter is reintroduced as a courageous charming goofball (Chris Pratt). Hes got the swagger of a self-styled top dog. In fact hes adopted the alias Star Lord a majestic moniker that inspires exactly zero awe in everyone he meets. There are still touches of the boy Peter used to be. Hes a walking repository of Reagan-era pop culture who travels everywhere with his beloved Sony Walkman. When he purloins an alien orb from its cavernous hiding place hes re-enacting the Indy-in-the-jungle scene from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" beat for beat. And his sense of humor is aggressively juvenile. When Pratt delivers a naughty joke about bodily fluids in space he smirks like a sophomore. You wouldnt catch Captain America doing that but Pratts still-a-kid-at-heart attitude carries the day. The plot is the plot of many a Marvel film with a big creep on a space throne planning to destroy a planet for obscure motives. Whatever. For a variety of reasons everyone wants Peters stolen orb or the bounty on his head. Among those on his tail are green-skinned humanoid weapon Gamora (Zoe Saldana) the testy trigger-happy Rocket a cybernetic raccoon (excitedly voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his partner Groot a lumbering treelike creature. Groots conversation consists of one brief sentence ""I am Groot."" Yet Vin Diesels gravel-throated performance and the creatures computer-generated expressions are so sweetly eloquent that he takes the films acting honors. Remember how endearing Diesel was as a big lug alien in ""The Iron Giant""? Hes that good here. GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and for some language. When that quartet bumble their way into space prison they encounter Drax (wrestler Dave Bautista) who has skin like tooled leather and a lack of humor that is entertaining in itself. Since they all have a beef against the cosmic warlord Ronan (Lee Pace playing ominous until its his turn to snatch some laughs) they team up. Gamora calls their coalition ""the biggest idiots in the galaxy"" and their frustration with each other is a riot. As are the richly flavorful pop-ins by indelible character actors John C. Reilly and Michael Rooker. Hats off to the producers for handing this property to writer/director James Gunn. Hes no bland Hollywood clone but a graduate of schlocky Troma Entertainment home of off-the-wall projects like ""The Toxic Avenger."" Gunns warped comic sensibility percolates throughout creating an alternate dimension of runaway silliness. Surely no other filmmaker could work so many Kevin Bacon ""Footloose"" references and a Rob Zombie vocal cameo into a movie about saving the universe. Or stage a space battle scene that mimics the antique arcade game Galaga. Theres much more than quippy dialogue and visual comedy on display here. ""Guardians"" is a showcase of breathtaking production detail. Peters space hot rod the Milano is a two-tone blue and orange dreamboat a craft that seems destined to become as iconic as the Millennium Falcon. The scenes of desolate alien worlds have an eerie beauty. The little things are perfectly rendered too. When Rocket wakes up from sleeping on the floor he has an epic case of bed head. Viewers who scour the corners of the frame will find the film stuffed with tongue-in-cheek surprises. Was that a pack of Alf trading cards in Peters orbiting bachelor pad? In another departure from the Marvel formula the studio withheld the traditional bonus scene following the finale from the version of the film shown to critics and preview audiences. No big deal. When the end credits announcement popped up that ""The Guardians of the Galaxy will return"" that was enough to send me out of the theater beaming. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

John Shearer Director James Gunn arrives at the premiere of ""The Guardians Of The Galaxy"" at El Capitan Theatre on Monday July 21 2014 in Los Angeles. (Photo by John Shearer/Invision/AP) If youre old enough to remember when sci-fi and comic books were fun ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" will be your new favorite movie. If youre not it will set a standard for everything you see.From Flash Gordon to Mad magazine a bent wing of the starship American Enterprise steered pop culture in a loopy direction. But ever since ""Star Wars"" devolved into daddy issues genre entertainment has gotten grim and grandiose. Now every popcorn movie has a dark center and sometimes its the hero.Whizzy wondrous and wildly funny ""Guardians"" is the first Marvel release that rightly could be called a comedy. But notwithstanding the talking tree and the gun-toting raccoon its so much more than a spoof of space operas or a freeze-ray aimed at doleful competitor DC Comics. Its an instant classic a game-changer worthy of Spielberg or Lucas. The maestro is Missourian James Gunn whose previous movies were modest-budget exercises in body horror (""Slither"") and superhero psychoanalysis (""Super""). Left to his own devices Gunn has a sinister sense of humor; but given a bottomless pot of Marvels gold he has built a vehicle that can accommodate fanboys and families alike with room in the back seat for a big beating heart.On a technical level its astonishing with World of Tomorrow cityscapes and pop-flavored 3-D imagery that demand to be seen on a big screen. On a storytelling level its a back-to-the-future flashback to the misfit crew of the Millennium Falcon with a 70s soundtrack transporting us to a mallplex far far away.The AM-radio hits are on a cassette inherited by an earthling named Peter Quill when his mother dies in 1988. At the end of that Spielbergian prelude the grieving boy is levitated from outer-ring St. Louis to outer space where he becomes an adventurer who calls himself Starlord (Chris Pratt). Like Indiana Jones the cocksure explorer plunders artifacts and when he finds a mystical orb on an abandoned planet he double-crosses his kidnapper/benefactor Yondu (Michael Rooker).But there are other creatures who covet the whatzit including pint-size pirate Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) Rockets leafy tri-syllabic sidekick Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) and a green-skinned assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who may or may not be working for evil overlord Ronan (Lee Pace). Busted while bickering over the booty (by flatfoot John C. Reilly) the fantastic four are sent to a space prison where they reluctantly form a team of do-gooders with the addition of vengeful hulk Drax (Dave Bautista) who blames Ronan for the death of his wife and child. Family looms large in this story based on a cult comic by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. Zamoras sister (Karen Gillan) is a deadly enforcer for their evil father Thanos and Peter still has unresolved questions about his own father (which are likely to be addressed in the just-announced sequel). The punchline is that the misfit Guardians form a family of their own rooted in the cosmic consciousness of Groot.With only three words at his disposal Diesel manages to hijack several scenes as the seven-foot Groot while the ballistic banditry of Rocket Raccoon is a guilty pleasure writ small. But its Pratt who steals the movie with a mix of charm and sarcasm that Harrison Ford couldnt muster with a time machine.Surrender earthlings. Its the Guardians world and youll be happy to live in it.What ""Guardians of the Galaxy""  Four stars out of four  Rating PG-13  Run time 200  Content Intense sequences of sci-fi action and some crude language Joe Williams is the film critic of the Post-Dispatch and the author of the book ""Hollywood Myths.""

Lets do it too"" Thats how slapdash this kitschy comic-book flick plays on screen. And while it can be a refreshing twist when a film doesnt take itself seriously the lack of quality blockbusters this summer is no laughing matter. PHOTOS Stars as superheroes The bright news is that weve landed in outer space -- a welcome change in scenery from the usual steel stale metropolis. Thats where we find Peter Quill (Chris Pratt a very good everyman) flitting around an abandoned planet. He takes off his mask presses play on a retro Walkman and starts to . . . . dance. To the 1970s hit ""Come and Get Your Love."" Yes its that kind of kitsch. The music as detailed in the prologue is a track off a soft-rock mixtape given to a young Peter by his cancer-stricken mom. After her death he dashes outside the hospital grounds and is promptly abducted by aliens. Twenty-six years later Peter is making a living as a happy-go-lucky scavenger/thief. A plan to steal a powerful glowing sphere goes awry and he lands in an inter-galactic jail. There he reluctantly aligns with a motley crew of fellow bandits and revenge-seekers a warrior (Zoe Saldana) a wiseass raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) a talking tree who only mumbles the sentence ""I am Groot"" (the easiest paycheck Vin Diesel will ever cash) and a brute (Dave Bautista). Together they try to ensure the destruction--causing gem doesnt fall into nefarious hands. PHOTOS Zoes pregnancy style That concludes the rudimentary plot recap as only Marvel geeks will fully grasp its convoluted play-by-play. Reach down for the popcorn and prepare to miss a barrage of sci-fi villains -- played by the likes of Djimon Hounsou Lee Pace and Josh Brolin -- hidden under heavy makeup as well as a slew of space-aged battles. Those who didnt live-tweet from Comic-Con might find it all a bit exhausting. Perhaps the screenwriters were too busy laughing at their jokes to streamline an accessible narrative? Oh about those jokes. The misfits hardly miss a chance to toss off a knucklehead one-liner and a handful of them zing. A running gag about Footloose earns the biggest chuckle. (Want to know whats wrong with that? Nothing). The irreverent humor is an admittedly original approach to the genre -- as is the aforementioned Solid Gold 70s soundtrack. The collateral damage is a total lack of an emotional connection to any of these characters. Saldanas Gamora is covered in green yet she might as well be a blank canvas. PHOTOS Celebs whove lost or gained weight for roles The essential problem here This B-list adaptation is not quite hilarious enough to be a gut-busting comedy or suspenseful enough to be a sci-fi adventure for the ages. Heres hoping the recently announced sequel truly reaches for the stars.

Starring Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana and Lee Pace. Directed by James Gunn. (PG-13. 121 minutes.) ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is pretty much where action movies are these days - a combination of comedy without wit action without drama and elaborate visuals that are nothing much to look at. That just this little is enough to take ""Guardians"" into the realm of ""not bad"" says more about the state of action than it does about the movie itself. It deals with an effort to save ""the galaxy"" but this is a notion without emotion. We are shown nothing about this particular galaxy that should make us care whether it gets saved or blown up like Vulcan in ""Star Trek"" (2009). Theres no burning reason to root for one set of spaceships over the other. Rather the mere concept of ""saving the galaxy"" is supposed to engage the audience - for two hours. Yes there are jokes but most of these are along the lines of the movies making fun of itself before we all notice theres nothing to take seriously. In place of wit ""Guardians"" offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it. Everyone is clearly working but nothing is really happening - and yet the effort is so evident that theres an impulse to reward it. More in Movies Happy Christmas review Pluses makes up for the minuses The Kill Team review Chilling look at soldiers atrocities Get on Up movie review Browns life lacks dramatic arc Havana Curveball premieres at S.F. Jewish Film Festival Lacking dimension As for the three-dimensional visuals theres little here that couldnt have been rendered just as well in two. In fact the three dimensions just dim the movie into murkiness making the experience too much like watching it with sunglasses on. Taking the 3-D glasses off during the close-ups provides the occasional relief. The movie starts with a poorly acted but recognizably human situation of a little boy saying goodbye to his mother who is on her deathbed. After she dies he stumbles out of the hospital inconsolable. And just as were forgetting the kind of movie weve signed up for a flying saucer shows up - as unwelcome and as out of place as any fictional flying saucer in history - and beams the boy on board. Twenty-six years later Peter (Chris Pratt) is a merry roving space rogue a happy-go-lucky fellow flying through the universe living off his smarts so its a wonder he doesnt starve to death. He comes upon a metal orb about the size of a softball which apparently everyone wants for some intense yet unspecified purpose. Suffice it to say its like the ring in ""The Lord of the Rings"" or the little box that raised hell in the ""Hellraiser"" series. Most of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" consists of Peter trying to hold on to the orb or trying to get the orb back or trying to prevent someone from doing something really horrible with it. The actual powers of the orb arent quite specified. The powers are there for the convenience of the screenwriters to allow great but not ultimate damage to make things always desperate but never hopeless dangerous but still doable. The situation is in fact analogous to that of Marvel Enterprises which produced ""Guardians"" based on its comic book series. Right now Marvel holds the orb of power and it seems nothing can stop it. But will it really take over the entertainment galaxy? With movies like this? Im beginning to doubt it. Anyway while the evil Ronan (Lee Pace) pursues him through the universe Peter goes about putting together his team of misfit space guardians which includes a half-man half-raccoon (nicely voiced by Bradley Cooper) Zoe Saldana as a lethal and damaged woman of mystery and a human-like tree known as Groot. Vin Diesel is the voice of Groot and something needs to be said about the use of Diesel in the promotion of this film. In the action realm Diesel is a name to be reckoned with an actor people look forward to seeing. But in ""Guardians"" his voice is not only unimportant; its doctored. Whats more Groot has only one line of dialogue which he repeats over and over. For all intents and purposes there is no recognizable sign of Diesel in this movie - and too bad. He could have helped. No time for boredom John C. Reilly does appear as a politician on a threatened planet and he gets the films few genuine laughs. Glenn Close also has a small role lending an illusion of gravitas in exchange for a paycheck which seems a fair exchange. To its credit ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" belabors little so theres no time to get bored and the fact that it takes nothing seriously including itself saves it from all of the usual outer space ostentation. Its a cheerful emptiness neither good nor bad and pleasant enough. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday Jul. 29 2014 900PM EDT Last updated Wednesday Jul. 30 2014 151PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by James Gunn Written by James Gunn and Nicole Perlman Starring Chris Pratt Vin Diesel Bradley Cooper and Zoe Saldana Classification PG Year 2014 Country USA Language English A smart-alecky Saturday morning cartoon bloated with a 170-million (U.S.) worth of visual effects the latest Marvel film Guardians of the Galaxy is too loud too long and too busy but - heres the good part - also wonderfully silly. Unlike so many superheroes burdened by their messianic purpose Guardians Peter Quill hasnt even got past the ""mess"" part. Video Video Film critic Liam Laceys top three blockbuster-alternatives for summer viewing As played by the burly but light-moving Chris Pratt (from televisions Parks and Recreation) Quill has a sense of high self-esteem blissfully unconnected to reality. He putters about the galaxy in a spaceship equivalent to a hot rod beater sleeps with various alien females and scavenges for junk on abandoned planets. Quill likes to think of himself not just as a garbage picker but an ""outlaw"" who tries unsuccessfully to be known as ""Star Lord.""At least he has a heros tragic past briskly accounted for in the films opening scene As a child just moments after Peters mother succumbed to cancer in her hospital bed he was sucked up into a spaceship by a blue-skinned extra-terrestrial and scavenging mentor Yondu (Michael Rooker). Despite that traumatic double-whammy he survives. We catch up with him 26 years later as a cheerful space slacker boogying along with his antique Walkman listening to 1970s mix tapes his mother made for him. Theres an entire soundtrack of such songs as If You Like Pina Coladas Cherry Bomb Fooled Around and Fell in Love and Hooked on a Feeling Mom meant well but she had awful taste.While poking around in a cave Quill finds a softball-sized metal sphere which Peter observes has a ""a shiny suitcase Ark-of-the-Covenant Maltese-Falcon kinda vibe"". Immediately he and his orb are the subject of a space chase. Chief among the orb coveters is Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) a Darth Vader-like baddie with a black mask and sepulchral growl of a voice. There are other villains though its hard to keep them straight without a complete Marvel family tree on hand.A rash of bounty hunters spring into action at the news of the orbs discovery and most of them end up in an intergalactic jail where along with Peter they form a tentative alliance of shared interests. These include the green-skinned assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana). Theres also a sarcastic cyborg raccoon Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his usefully large partner a walking tree named Groot (Vin Diesel whose entire dialogue consists of saying repeatedly ""I am Groot""). Adding muscle to the mix is a prison brute named Drax (former wrestler Dave Bautista) who suffers from a patience-straining literal-mindedness.After escaping from their space prison the five misfits set off in Peters spaceship with a plan to fence the orb to one of Gomoras contacts called The Collector (Benicio Del Toro in an outfit Liberace might consider de trop) where they learn about the orbs threat to the Earth-like planet of Xanadar presided over by peaceable leader Glenn Close (in a hairdo that resembles a large cronut) and John C. Reilly as a goofy good-natured cop.There are any number of elements here that suggests a Star Wars parody though The Guardians of the Galaxy which first appeared as a comic in 1969 predated George Lucass film by seven years. In updating it from various comic incarnations director Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman have picked and discarded characters freely for what amounts to a magpie pastiche of various space adventures. Gunn who directed the horror spoof Slither (2006) and black comedy Super starring Rainn Wilson as a wannabe costumed crusader has a talent for the playfully subversive. Thats not entirely congruent with Marvels insistence on screen-filling battle sequences designed to stun you into slack-jawed submission which tends to mean that Guardians is either spectacular or funny but rarely both.The humour is in the constant verbal asides and off-beat characters not in the predictable save-the-galaxy plot (the spoilers built into the movies title) plot. Nor is it any great surprise that Gunn has already been given the green light for a Guardians of the Galaxy sequel which induces both hope for more comedy in future comic book movies and a shadow of foreboding Lets hope that a few sequels down the line we wont be subjected to a reboot in which Peter Quill suffers a dark night of the funny bone. And it would be just too lazy to have Rocket the Raccoon morphing into a masked villain.

"Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Bradley Cooper Gives One of His Best-Ever Performances as a Trash-Talking Space Raccoon Bradley Cooper Gives One of His Best-Ever Performances as a Trash-Talking Space Raccoon Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.July 31 2014 1142 AM Guardians of the Galaxy Sure its a Marvel spoof from Marvel but its surprisingly light on its feet. By Dana Stevens Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer in Guardians of the Galaxy. Courtesy of Marvel James Gunns Guardians of the Galaxy represents a new wing of subspecialization for Marvel Studios. Rather than deliver another update of a familiar superhero (Spider-Man Captain America the Hulk) or jam a bunch of familiar superheroes into a superteam (the Avengers) Guardians digs back into the Marvel archives finds a handful of near-forgotten less-than-heroic characters and reimagines them as shambling comic takeoffs on the impervious do-gooders weve come to expect in our summer blockbusters. Guardians of the Galaxy (co-written by the director and Nicole Perlman) is a Marvel spoof created by Marvel--a provenance that should be enough to suggest you wont find any Lenny Bruce-level social commentary here. This is a corporate-issued palate cleanser meant to whet our once-sated appetites for the next course of ""serious"" superhero fare. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Still the films pokes at action-movie grandiosity are generally pretty funny the soundtrack bounces from one tasty tune to the next and peeping out at regular intervals between the space-pod battles and gratuitous 3-D gimmicks is a story about characters whose fate actually begins to matter to us. Guardians of the Galaxy is no Lego Movie (this years other Chris Pratt-starring comedy about ragtag explorers which midway into 2014 is still looking like one of my favorites of the year). But GotG made me laugh a lot and almost cry twice and its late July and Ill take it. For a movie whose primary intent is to elicit just that kind of easy late-summer enjoyment Guardians starts with a cold open that shifts jarringly from sad to terrifying. A little boy Peter Quill (Wyatt Oleff as a child) having just heard his dying mother speak her last words runs out of the hospital crying--and is promptly abducted by a spaceship that was apparently hovering outside waiting for the next human specimen. All Peter brings along from his old life is a cassette Walkman containing a mix tape created for him by his mother whose taste happily for the viewer runs to 70s-vintage Top 40 hits like the Raspberries ""Go All the Way"" and Redbones ""Come and Get Your Love."" Bradley Cooper gives one of his best performances to date as the voice of a trash-talking space raccoon. Advertisement As an adult now played by Chris Pratt Quill has become a kind of space pirate for hire raiding ancient sites around the galaxy for treasures he sells on the black market. His theft of one mysterious silver sphere brings him into conflict with the forbidding Ronan (Lee Pace) a solemn blue alien in the service of a would-be godlike figure called Thanos (who appears to us mainly as a Wizard of Oz-style face on a curtain). Quills attempt to fence the orb to a collector (Benicio del Toro) leads to the discovery that this object contains a weapon of universe-conquering power. (The scripts failure to mock this MacGuffins transparent MacGuffinness is one of its weaknesses--theres a lot of time expended on convincing us of the transcendent value of the sphere when we really just want to get back to the fun of plotting to steal it.) As he attempts to find a buyer for his stolen goods Quill is pursued by various bounty hunters and fellow space outlaws. The bright-green Gamora (Zoe Saldana) has been sent by her adoptive father Thanos to kill Quill and take possession of the orb but there are hints she may have turned against her evil dad for her own profit. Meanwhile Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) a mutant raccoonlike creature has been promised a reward for Quills capture; hes accompanied by his gentle sidekick Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) a being made entirely of intertwining tree branches. During a stint in intergalactic jail Quills would-be captors wind up deciding to team up with him sell the orb and split the profit. The motley crew picks up another stowaway Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista) who comes from a planet without figures of speech resulting in a wealth of Amelia Bedelia-style misunderstandings. Its the wisecracking repartee among these five adventurers that holds together the otherwise disparate elements of Guardians which is equal parts Star Wars-style space opera Galaxy Quest-esque genre spoof and generic sci-fi blockbuster. The business with the silver sphere and the Thanos-worshipping villains is taken strangely seriously as though to preserve enough suspense around this storyline to revisit it in some future more canonical Marvel movie (ya think?). But once we rejoin our comrades on the renegade spaceship were in a different narrative reality one in which a climactic confrontation with a hooded archenemy might plausibly culminate in an awkward one-way dance-off. The battle sequences are frequent extended and expensive-looking without being particularly thrilling. But theres genuine humor and even as they grow to trust one another warmth in the scenes among the five squabbling Guardians of the Galaxy as this initially unimposing troupe is sarcastically dubbed by an unimpressed villain. I hope Bradley Cooper wont take it amiss when I say that he gives one of his best performances to date as the voice of a trash-talking space raccoon. Rocket--whos adorably rendered in a style that suggests but isnt stop-motion animation--at first struck me as overly cute one of those cloying smartass animals inserted to pander to young children in the audience. But Ill be damned if Cooper didnt give this ring-tailed creature some layers. Rockets raw grief when he sits down and weeps over a personal loss late in the movie--well that was one of the two times I almost cried. (The other was when the mom said goodbye to her kid in the hospital because come on.) Rockets crabby exchanges with his vegetal sidekick Groot beautifully voiced by Vin Diesel are among the movies highlights. Groot can only speak a single phrase-- ""I am Groot""--but he utters it with so many different intonations that it comes to constitute a language of its own one which only his pal the raccoon can accurately interpret. Top Comment More... -Brandon Join In Chris Pratt (looking distinctly buffer than usual) and Zoe Saldana (looking distinctly greener) strike both comic and romantic sparks as the humanoid rivals who first tangle over control of the deadly sphere then nearly make out on a balcony overlooking the planet Xandar--at least until the almost-in-the-bag Gamora pulls away accusing Quill of ""pelvic sorcery."" Glenn Close Djimon Hounsou and John C. Reilly also pop up as respectively a benevolent Xandarian leader a merciless assassin and a regular-guy military officer. Guardians of the Galaxy isnt going to change any lives--its resemblance to Star Wars is more a matter of aspiration than attainment. But the films scruffy smartass band of brothers along with Gunns light directorial touch make for an invigorating breather after too many summer weekends of hammer-wielding superheroic solemnity. If Marvel is trying (in the words of one of the soundtracks pop gems) to get us ""hooked on a feeling"" its job is done. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Tobey/The Washington Post) By Michael OSullivan July 31 2014 The most telling commentary made in anticipation of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" came in the form of a tweet ""DC/WB is all like Wonder Womans too confusing for a movie and Marvel/Disney is all like Heres a raccoon with a machine gun."" That joke posted last August by comedian and writer Brett White neatly contrasts two things. On one hand theres the ongoing impasse over at DC Comics (and its studio partner Warner Bros.) that has so far prevented a Wonder Woman movie from being made (though the character will make her screen debut in 2016s ""Batman vs. Superman Dawn of Justice""). On the other theres the shamelessly gleeful pandering of Marvels ""Guardians"" which prominently features a trigger-happy furball voiced by Bradley Cooper. The CGI raccoon character named Rocket is only one of myriad delights in the new film which is as close to a perfect summer movie as they come. Under normal circumstances the mere presence of a talking raccoon might serve as a cleaver effectively dividing the moviegoing public into those who hate such digital chimeras -- think Gollum and Caesar the chimp -- and those who love them. But I suspect that even some of those on the far side of the divide might find something else to love about ""Guardians."" It manages the trick of being both an unironic sci-fi action-adventure flick and a zippy parody of one. Its exciting funny self-aware beautiful to watch and even for a flickering instant or two almost touching. The touching part is dispensed with early -- because what we really want to get to is that talking raccoon. In a 1988 prologue the films hero Peter Quill (played as a boy by Wyatt Oleff) is shown at his cancer-stricken mothers deathbed just before being abducted by an alien spaceship. Flash forward to a futuristic version of the present day on some crazy planet where a now-grown Quill (Chris Pratt all muscles leather and snark) is attempting to steal a mysterious orb that seemingly everyone else also wants. 1 of 62 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Four-star movies View Photos Keep tabs on the films that received top honors from Post critics over the last year.

Cathy Kanavy/Bleecker Street Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Unfortunately the wrong guy eventually winds up with it. After some nicely choreographed action sequences involving chase imprisonment escape fighting and comedic bickering between competing mercenaries and thieves each of whom has his or her own agenda a villain named Ronan (Lee Pace) gets it. Ronan plans to use the power it contains -- hinted at in other Marvel movies -- to destroy a peaceful planet leading Peter to forge a tenuous alliance with his rivals to save the planets inhabitants. These rivals -- soon to adopt the moniker Guardians of the Galaxy -- include a green-skinned assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana); Rocket and his treelike sidekick Groot (voice of Vin Diesel); and a man-mountain called Drax the Destroyer (Washington-born professional wrestler Dave Bautista). Drax who is less interested in the orb than in seeking revenge for Ronans murder of his family provides a big chunk of the films humor with his propensity for making comments delivered in an uncomprehending deadpan that interpret everything anyone says literally. ""Nothing goes over my head"" he grunts. ""I would catch it."" The jokes though at times groan-worthy blast by fast and frequently. Its the funniest of any Marvel movie yet lending the film a lightness that goes a long way toward deflating the grandiosity that sometimes inflates and bloats the studios films. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" goes down like cotton candy colorful sweet nutrition-free melting in your mouth. Most of that is because of Pratt who may have found the role he was born to play. As Peter -- a man who would love for people to call him ""Star-Lord"" but who just cant make it happen with a straight face -- the actor exerts the disarming superpower of charm. His character has been described aptly as a cross between Han Solo of ""Star Wars"" and Marty McFly of ""Back to the Future."" But hes also got a little of James T. Kirks DNA in him (minus Shatners Shakespearean self-importance) which manifests in his predilection for the ladies even those with Crayola-colored skin. ""Guardians"" gets that the whole thing is a gas. Its got a great soundtrack -- oldies from the 70s and 80s that Peters mother left to him on a mix tape which Peter treasures more than the orb. Turning on his Walkman Peter -- oh what the heck Star-Lord -- rocks out to the retro pleasures of a bygone age joyously and unabashedly celebrating a time when things were less complicated.

Jay Maidment/Marvel hide caption toggle caption Jay Maidment/Marvel Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) have some adventures together in the terrific new Guardians Of The Galaxy. Jay Maidment/Marvel The worst thing about making a post-Avengers Marvel movie is how far ahead of the game you are when you start. Your film will be marketed with brute force treated as arguably the biggest opening of the summer reviewed everywhere and very likely to land among the most commercially successful films of the year whether or not you do anything interesting with it. From a professional development standpoint it wouldnt be unreasonable to describe your task as ""dont screw up."" Theres no reason for that not to inspire cautious tiptoeing for it not to motivate a precise tonal copy of whats worked in films like Iron Man and The Avengers and ultimately for it not to lead to a zillion-dollar effort to ensure a solid uninteresting base hit creatively speaking. So its particularly surprising how often Guardians Of The Galaxy feels very unlike other Marvel movies and other comic-book movies. Directed by James Gunn (who also directed the offbeat superhero comedy Super) and written by Gunn and Nicole Perlman Guardians introduces us to Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) a capable and ambivalent wisecracking thief still working for the aliens who abducted him from Earth as a little boy shortly after the death of his mother. As wisecracking thieves always do Quill finds himself in a jam and not long after hes in jail with the mysterious and fearless Gamora (Zoe Saldana) the grief-stricken and huge Drax (Dave Bautista) a big walking tree named Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and the particularly mercenary Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper). They soon find a common purpose and were off. Theres an orb - oh theres always an orb - and theres a preening and pronouncing bad guy (Lee Pace) who speaks at all times as if hes an action figure being waved around and given voice by a growling kid whos just recently discovered comics and theres a message about the importance of friendship and teamwork. What distinguishes Guardians Of The Galaxy is its tone which arrives early in the form of the 70s mixtapes that Quill got from his mom which he still blasts on his adored Sony Walkman. After the brief prologue we first find him kicking and cool-guy-dancing through the puddles of a faraway planet while Redbones ""Come And Get Your Love"" plays. Hes very much a Marvel hero but Pratt - a tremendously charismatic actor whose work as the huge-hearted and slightly foggy-headed Andy Dwyer on Parks And Recreation foreshadowed some of what hes doing here - gives him both a shaggier charm and a much more specifically comedic carriage than most Marvel heroes. This is not the suave swaggering wit of Tony Stark; it is a much more uncertain and blithely goofy thing. The simple fact that Guardians Of The Galaxy is closer to a pure comedy is what distinguishes it most. Iron Man and The Avengers certainly are witty but theyre not comedies and this is. Where those films largely depend on well-timed ironic understatement and the occasional Hulk-on-Loki beatdown for their chuckles this movie has jokes. Lots of jokes. Plain old jokes. Laugh lines. Punchy cuts between serious action sequences and bone-dry deadpan takes. It has wonderful face-pulling. It has mechanical-eyeball comedy. What comes through so delightfully is a balance between the weary sometimes skeptical but deeply affectionate good will of adults who love an enjoyable blockbuster and the campy self-serious exploration of good and evil that kids can happily bathe in before they start to think of comics as fundamentally a capitalist enterprise. You could see this movie and then have a long debate over exactly what Pace is doing how in on the joke he is and how much he knows that intensity-wise hes doing Release The Kraken MULTIPLIED by Emperor Palpatine TIMES Loki PLUS everybody who gets a mask pulled off his head at the end of a Scooby-Doo cartoon. Its not that hes not doing a real villain but hes also doing the villain the idea of a comic-book villain. While hes giving it all hes got when it comes to menace his delicious super-ferocity is meant to work hand-in-glove with the more obviously comedic stuff that Quills team is doing. (Interestingly the constantly joke-cracking Rocket is probably the least successful invention on the team; Groots limited capacity for comedy - hes a tree remember - becomes the funniest bit of all.) Theres plenty of heart in Guardians but it gets its emotional heft largely from the warmth that this kind of comedy inherently contains. Genuinely funny people engender sympathy (see the witty Hans in Die Hard) so comedy isnt just for giggles its also for resonance. But heres the thing its fun. F-U-N. Remember F-U-N? The thing that blockbusters used to be before they started crushing cities full of innocent people and seemingly forgetting all about them? The thing that the Richard Donner Superman was? The thing that used to at least be one of the most important big-money-movie elements alongside bloodletting franchising and an unrelenting ashen grimness that could be rounded off to approximate seriousness of purpose? Yeah. Fun I missed it. On the downside Guardians is probably least inventive in its aesthetic it doesnt play like a Marvel movie but its visuals sure look like one. Orbs explosions huge spacecraft ... all of this has been seen. There are a handful of very pretty shots - Gunn seems to have a fondness for floating and uses it in several places to lovely effect - and theres a nicely manic fight sequence between Quill and Gamora early on. But the branding of the Marvel Universe is certainly more consistent and more easily felt visually than tonally. That music on the other hand is deftly chosen. Everybody from Stanley Kubrick to Michael Moore has done the bit where you play upbeat music over downbeat images for a kick of irony but there are a few places in Guardians where songs including ""Hooked On A Feeling"" (admittedly a well-worn weapon at this point) create a more complex sensation than the expected orchestral soundtrack would have. And while the other Marvel movies are similarly contemporary theyre also much more Earth-bound; its a funny feeling - in a good way - to see people having epic battles over ancient artifacts in space and have the music create such a temporal link to this particular mans lost life on Earth. Its easy to create a clean break between the satisfaction of popular entertainment and the rewards of great art and that divide while not quite as easy to define as it seems is certainly genuine. Whats much shakier is the idea that the satisfaction of popular entertainment is valueless while the rewards of great art matter. Theres always been a place for F.U.N. - its always been one of the reasons people seek out culture. To see it done really really well with purpose and energy and wit is itself awfully rewarding.

A young boy inseparable from his Walkman watches his mother die of cancer and then runs in tears out onto a field where hes promptly abducted by a spaceship. The scene positions this entire sci-fi spectacle as a wish-fulfillment fantasy anchoring its derring-do and frivolity in grief. We read and watch stuff like this to get away it tells us. So come away with us. Of course this is just another variation on the old Spielbergian motif of the broken child saved by wonder but it still works. Its also an artful dodge because while this very enjoyable film does return briefly to this scene later on it mostly avoids anything approaching this level of poignancy for the rest of its running time. That young boy 26 years later has grown up to become Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) who wanders space and calls himself Star-Lord a ""Ravager"" whose chief aim appears to be to find steal or smuggle cool stuff to sell. After he gets his hands on a mysterious and highly coveted object known as ""The Orb"" hes thrust together with a group of intergalactic misfits A sociopathic genetically modified talking raccoon named Rocket voiced by Bradley Cooper; a giant tree-creature named Groot (who can say only ""I am Groot"" but can still somehow get the raccoon to understand him aA la Chewbacca and Han Solo) voiced by Vin Diesel; beautiful conflicted warrior Gamora played by Zoe Saldana (claiming her third giant franchise; is she our current record-holder?); and musclebound humorless vengeful Drax the Destroyer played by wrestling star Dave Bautista. The film jumps between galaxies and planets and interstellar colonies with amazing proficiency. Director James Gunn who co-wrote the script with Nicole Perlman has a rare talent one that George Lucas also had but few filmmakers working in this genre do He can effortlessly cut between evocative worlds weve never seen before without losing sight of the action and the pace of his narrative. With a few deft strokes he can place us inside an entire mining colony built around the decaying head of an ancient deity floating around the cosmos -- the same way that Lucas and his directors could throw us from a swamp planet to Cloud City without having to sit around and give us belabored explanations of what these were. This is a precious gift an intuitive ability to understand both what we need to know and what we dont need to know. A story of this scale needs elegant shorthand the kind of shorthand whose very lack doomed films like John Carter and After Earth. Gunn has it in spades. A good thing too because the plot itself is ridiculously -- and I suspect purposefully -- dense having to do with something called an ""Infinity Stone"" which apparently has the power to destroy entire galaxies when wielded by the right being. Or something. Again it doesnt really matter. This might be in terms of sheer destructive capability the most powerful MacGuffin in the Marvel universe and yet it feels thoroughly inconsequential. Thats because this is an insistently lighthearted movie. Think about it Whereas most action films would have a character designated as comic relief Guardians has a character designated as straight-man relief. Practically everyone else is comic relief of one form or another. And so the film eagerly delivers a nonstop onslaught of irreverent one-liners and jokey exchanges and random pop-culture references -- endearing gags you want to laugh at even when theyre not particularly funny. Context is everything here. Consider a line like ""He says hes an A-hole but -- and Im quoting him here -- hes not 100 percent a dick."" Or ""I come from a planet of outlaws. Billy the Kid. Bonnie and Clyde. John Stamos."" These wouldnt be particularly brilliant lines in a standard-issue comedy. (Really? More Stamos jokes?) But wedged inside a superhero spectacle set in outer space it all feels hilarious the same way the familiar classic-rock soundtrack featuring everything from ""Moonage Daydream"" to ""Cherry Bomb"" feels cool. The movie wins you over with its calculated incongruities. It has a charm similar to this years earlier The Lego Movie but that film used its wild relentless gags to build to a celebration of unbridled creativity and diversity and even managed to question things like fate faith and free will. But in Guardians of the Galaxy theyre mostly just jokes. And that frivolity might be both the films greatest asset and its chief limitation. Gunn occasionally gives us moments that suggest he wants to do more than just make us chuckle. He has a great eye not necessarily for pretty pictures but for images of emotional grandeur -- whether its of a spaceship beaming in two doomed lovers floating in what appears to be a final embrace or for the spectacle of thousands of tiny ships conjoining to create a kind of protective cosmic netting. But he almost always undercuts these moments with gags as if hes afraid to commit to something bigger darker more profound.A  The film seems forever on the verge of becoming transcendent but something keeps pulling it back -- a certain eager-to-please-ness maybe even an almost adolescent fear of the grand gesture. Gunn originally came up through the ranks at Troma (where he wrote Tromeo and Juliet) and a friend I saw Guardians of the Galaxy with who loved the movie called it ""the most expensive Troma film ever made."" That sounds about right and its not a bad thing. The film seems content to be the class clown of the Marvel Universe which is all well and good. But like most class clowns sometimes you wish it would apply itself -- because it seems capable of being so much more.

Which in a funny way is precisely the point.Countless numbers of people and humanoid aliens and cyborg-thingummies and small reptile-like critters get wasted in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" which depicts an interplanetary war of annihilation on a scale that makes Hitler look like a sensitive girly-man out of some Nicholas Sparks novel. But no it doesnt read as a violent movie at all at least by contemporary standards. Its a high-spirited swashbuckling lark driven by cartoonish special effects and an ingenious double-layered nostalgia that allows it to become a virtual mixtape of 70s hits that predate its intended audience ""Hooked on a Feeling"" ""The Pina Colada Song"" ""Fooled Around and Fell in Love"" etc. (Although I dont buy for a second that the person who supposedly put those songs on a mixtape in 19-whatever even knew about David Bowies ""Moonage Daydream"" or the Runaways ""Cherry Bomb."")Amid the slaughter of entire planetary civilizations I guess its no wonder that the raffish band of misfits at the center of this movie pay no attention when their takeoffs landings and battles take out random civilians by the carload. This is a recent trend in action movies and I dont quite know whether to call it callous or realistic the depiction of widespread collateral damage but without any reflection or consequences. The only deaths that make an impression on the Guardians are the long-ago killings of the wife and child of Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) a tattooed mountain of he-man humanoid who is among their number. Drax is an immensely enjoyable character who pulls a disproportionate number of this movies laughs a fierce warrior with a thesaurus-scale vocabulary who is incapable of understanding metaphor. ""Nothing goes over my head"" he proudly announces. ""My reflexes are too fast. I will seize it."" But the fact that Drax is driven by profound personal loss yet doesnt seem to notice the carnage all around him suggests the truth of Stalins maxim that one death is a tragedy but a million are a statistic.Im not actually suggesting that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" would be a better movie if it were all mournful and serious and death-obsessed. Zack Snyders ""Man of Steel"" wore that approach out to the point of ridiculousness with Superman astride a Killing Fields-style mountain of skulls. Im just pointing out a paradox thats baked into this kind of movie and cant be gotten out of it. When I say that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" embodies a kind of primitive or juvenile fascism - the essential ideology of the comic-book hero -- Im not claiming that the movies no fun or that I didnt enjoy myself. If fascism were boring people wouldnt be so drawn to it Furthermore Im not claiming that director James Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman are secret Dick Cheney fans or that the movies really about war with the Muslim world or whatever. Im saying that this amiable Robin Hood fable about a ragtag bunch of indestructible renegades who join forces to combat evil rests on an outrageously exaggerated version of teenage narcissism and on deeply ingrained American-movie ideas about individuality and mortality and power and death. The lives of individual Cool People are worth more than millions of boring and ordinary people violence and war are a form of ritual purification and a sufficient amount of awesomeness will render you immortal. To die would be an awfully big adventure as Peter Pan once observed - but we all understand that Peter Pan cannot die. You Might Also Like There may be another kind of friendly fascism at work here too but let me at least try to say some nice things first. I realize that theres no way to mollify the devotees of the Marvel movie universe who not only demand total box-office domination (which theyre definitely going to get at least this weekend) but also total toadying subservience to the tide of Irresistible Marvel Fun. First of all its not my job to make people feel better about liking something that is really really popular. There are a whole lot of places you can get that and honestly that desire for universal affirmation is kind of bizarre. Secondly I enjoyed this movie. Within limits. Its a largely successful franchise-launcher thats goofier and more freewheeling than most Marvel fare maybe because it originates in an especially obscure corner of the comic-book universe. Gunn who directed the memorable genre indies ""Super"" and ""Slither"" and wrote Snyders ""Dawn of the Dead"" graduates to the Hollywood big time with considerable style. He keeps the zingers coming fast and furious does OK with the action scenes given that theyre basically just computer animations and that nobody expects actual coherence and supplies an array of mostly agreeable supporting characters.Mind you I didnt enjoy it enough that I will ever want to sit through it again. Partly thats because the genetically engineered talking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper who plays the comic sidekick to Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) the rakish matinee-idol human hero is so irritating I yearned to run him over with my space SUV and then back it up slowly to make sure he was well and truly squished. And then theres Zoe Saldana giving a game enough as a green-tinged alien Amazon who turns against her evil alien adopted dad because - well I never really got that part honestly. You have to wonder if shes going to get tired of playing hot science-fiction chicks with weirdly colored skin. On the other hand Vin Diesel plays a tree and Ive got nothing but love for that tree. Its a talking tree. A talking ass-kicking tree whose only line ever is ""I am Groot."" I could decide to have a problem with the fact that Groot is supposed to be a peaceful life-loving tree who abjures violence until he decides to kill a whole bunch of people. But I think I made that point already and with Groot a folk hero is born. (If this franchise really takes off Ill be tapping my toes impatiently for the Drax-Groot spinoff movie.) Pratts Quill also known mockingly (but not mockingly enough) as ""Star-Lord"" is meant to be a cheerful self-deprecating rogue but is actually kind of a drag. He was abducted from Earth as a little boy in 1988 right after his dying mom gave him the 70s mixtape - see? Nostalgia for her lost youth not his - that becomes his most prized possession and the movies soundtrack. Gunn seems to realize that were better off not focusing much on the official plot of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" which involves an interlocking passel of villains I couldnt begin to explain a galactic treasure hunt for a MacGuffin-like orb that contains a universe-melting substance (Quill observes that it has an ""Ark of the Covenant Maltese Falcon vibe"" a funny line but an utterly implausible thing for him to say) and outer space locations that include a mining outpost inside the severed head of God. You think Im kidding about that dont you? So we get to space out in a moonage daydream and pretend to like pina coladas while Marvel Comics uproots all our own memories and our memories of our parents memories - all those summers at the lake house and kisses behind the gym and Christmas dinners with Grandpa before he had that heart attack - and replaces them with a wiseass undead raccoon.

"Guardians of the Galaxy review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Guardians of the Galaxy  Guardians of the Galaxy keeps it loose enjoyable ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is different from other superhero movies because it doesnt take itself too seriously says film critic Michael Phillips. The movie has star power with Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is different from other superhero movies because it doesnt take itself too seriously says film critic Michael Phillips. The movie has star power with Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune 3 stars for Guardians of the Galaxy Like the 70s cassette mix tape so dear to its hero ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" scavenges all sorts of ""greatest hits"" precedents from ""Iron Man"" on down to come up with its own summertime fling. Its looser scruffier and more overtly comic than the average Marvel action fantasy. And despite the usual load of violence not all of it properly handled the film owes its relative buoyancy above all to Chris Pratt as the wisecracking space rogue at the helm.There are moments in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" when Pratt so funny on ""Parks and Recreation"" and already a versatile screen actor (""Moneyball"" ""Zero Dark Thirty"") seems to be growing into a quirky action hero before our eyes the way Robert Downey Jr. did in the first and best ""Iron Man."" The material is right for him. The Guardians were introduced in 1969; director James Gunns script refers heavily to the 2008 Marvel Comics incarnation created by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. Gunns film treats its universe as a parallel world to that of ""The Avengers"" and other Marvel hits. In ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" adventurer/scoundrel Peter Quill is an abducted earthling now knocking around the galaxy. Hes in the employ of Yondu (Michael Rooker) a treasure hunter. In an early scene blatantly swiped from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" Quill steals a mysterious and powerful orb much like the Tesseract the knick-knack causing all the fuss in the ""Avengers"" franchise.The orb is the apple of the bad guys eye; the bad guy Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) has designs on universal destruction (dont they all) and in particular the fate of the peaceable planet of Xander hangs in the balance. Glenn Close with a hairdo that screams out ""I deserve top billing"" has the unenviable task of playing it straight in a film more successful in its self-mocking streak. Xander as designed in the movie resembles the retro-future of ""Logans Run"" and thats the whole vibe of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" -- beloved 70s and 80s schlock reprocessed for a story of outsiders who figure out how to work together. Pratts co-stars include Zoe Saldana the ""Avatar"" alum as Gamora orphaned daughter of the formidable Thanos; Dave Bautista as the elaborately tattooed Drax; Rocket a genetic freak part raccoon part human voiced by Bradley Cooper; and Groot a sweet-natured tree with some human features voiced by Vin Diesel. Peter Quills Awesome Mix Vol. 1Read the story Before he arrived in big-budget filmmaking land director Gunn made the crafty and witty monster movie ""Slither"" and the nasty uneven superhero jape ""Super."" There are moments in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" when the brutality gets to be a bit much and the tone seems off. At one point Groot the lovable tree-fellow impales several adversaries on one of his branches and bangs them around for a few too many seconds. Its a gag modeled on the Hulk whaling on Loki in ""The Avengers"" but the joke sours before the visual punch line arrives.What I enjoy in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" co-written with Gunn by Nicole Perlman relates to the off-action scenes when special effects take a back seat to banter. My favorite scene is a simple one of the raccoon the tree the aliens and the human sitting around arguing the difference between hatching a universe-saving ""plan"" and a mere ""concept"" for a plan. I wish the scene went further but it works and its enough to give an orb-weary moviegoer some hope for a worthy sequel. Guardians of the Galaxy Marvel Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy.

Share Tweet Turns out the galaxy far far away is a pretty boring place to visit without someone around to roll his eyes put the moves on royalty and demand to get paid. George Lucas learned that lesson the hard way when he failed to supply his Star Wars prequels with a Han Solo equivalent--an irreverent personality to offset all the poker-faced Jedi business. It remains to be seen if J.J. Abrams will correct his oversight in the forthcoming Star Wars Episode VII which at least promises to put Harrison Ford back in a cockpit. In the meantime however audiences can get their dose of rebel swagger from Guardians Of The Galaxy the latest installment in the ongoing crossover event that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Guardians boasts not one but two Han Solo proxies--not to mention an ass-kicking Princess Leia surrogate a villain with a very Sithian fashion sense and the flora answer to Chewbacca. Also one of the Han Solo types is a talking raccoon.The other Han type is Peter Quill (professional goofball Chris Pratt) a self-mythologizing space bandit whod really prefer everyone call him Starlord. Whisked off to the cosmos as a boy after his mother died of cancer Quill spends his infinite free time giving alien floozies the Captain Kirk treatment and going all Indiana Jones on the artifacts of ancient alien temples. The latter pastime puts him in serious hot water after he swipes an unlikely doomsday device--a powerful orb that just about every warm body in the known universe wants to get its appendages on. Yes thats right Marvel has pivoted yet another franchise entry around some magical space MacGuffin a physical piece of exposition that the characters cant stop blathering about. There are also warring empires conniving royal offspring galactic military forces and other dense plot elements destined to put a coat of glaze over the eyes of the casual moviegoer.Whats faintly delightful about Guardians Of The Galaxy is that half of its heroes seem bored by the mythology too. Pulled from a fairly recent stack of Marvel back issues--the source material is only six years old--the Guardians certainly figure into the grand scheme the studio has been plotting since Iron Man. (Thanos the intergalactic heavy glimpsed during the credits of The Avengers appears in a couple scenes.) But Guardians requires no catch-up just an affinity for tongue-in-cheek space opera. As in Star Wars and any number of Joss Whedon projects surrogate family is the fuel cell This is a group effort of a blockbuster powered by the conflicting personalities of its ragtag roster.The brisk plot wastes little time bringing Quill together with his posse of bickering frenemies. Theres Gamora a traitorous warrior princess played by Zoe Saldana trading her blue Avatar skin for a new hue of green. Also boasting a grudge as well as an inhuman pigment is Drax (Dave Bautista) a vengeful Maximus type whose lack of a sense of humor becomes its own source of humor. Rounding out the makeshift super-team are two spectacular special effects Rocket the aforementioned raccoon voiced with wise-cracking enthusiasm by Bradley Cooper; and Groot a sentient and mobile tree brought to life through the rich baritone of Vin Diesel. Groot can say only one sentence (""I am Groot""); its a testament to Diesels emphatic delivery and the peerless work of the effects team that he becomes such an endearing creation--a fearsome creature with a gentle soul and a gift for slapstick.James Gunn the Troma veteran who made Slither and Super handles directing and co-writing duties. His zingers dont zing as sharply as Whedons but he more than survives the hyper-jump into mega-budget filmmaking orchestrating playful bursts of CGI mayhem and peppering the action with clever pulp flourishes like a deadly arrow that Michael Rooker controls by whistling. The galaxy of the title is like the Mos Eisley Cantina writ large each pit stop populated by seedy alien hustlers and weird swaggering creatures. Gunns most inspired touch however may be the way he interrupts an overly familiar Marvel score with snippets of classic rock and golden oldies--the mixtape selections Quill blasts from his prized walkmen. Its a move straight out of the Tarantino playbook and it works like gangbusters in a sci-fi context.Where Guardians begins to lose its grip a little is in the backstretch as it struggles to conform its winning eccentricity to what is essentially the Marvel franchise mold. Must all these films end the same way with a long and loud effects reel? And must their villains be such epic bores such stiff agents of stoic malevolence? (One could trade Lee Paces dastardly emperor for the evil elf of that last Thor movie and no one would really notice.) Gunn also leans a little too hard on the sentimentality in the second half rushing the teams transformation from uneasy companions to bona fide besties. His film powered by antagonistic banter soars highest when blurring the line between altruism and selfishness. In one of its funniest moments Quill yanks his green-skinned partner out of a fatal pinch only to try to spin the good deed in his amorous favor--an attempt that Mr. Solo himself would surely admire.

Photo Marvel MOVIE REVIEW Guardians of the Galaxy Running time 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 (profanity violence sexual innuendo). At the Empire the Union Square others. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" brings to mind some of the most unforgettable sci-fi event movies of the last 30 years. Alas those films are ""Howard the Duck"" and ""Green Lantern."" Chris Pratt stars as an interstellar frat-boy Indiana Jones out to steal and sell a precious orb that looks like a wire Christmas ornament from Pier 1 Imports. He teams up with a lady warrior (Zoe Saldana this time in greenface) who is double-crossing her villainous boss; a wisecracking Joisey-accented bounty-hunter raccoon (Bradley Cooper stealing work from Gilbert Gottfried); a large killer plant who says only ""I am Groot"" (though Vin Diesel is the one they hired to say this); and Drax (Dave Bautista) a block of muscle and tats. Our hero scruff-faced earthling Peter (Pratt) speaks in the kind of slang that passes for wit down at Delta Psi -- just keep saying ""dude"" ""chill"" or ""bro"" itll be hilarious. Drax issues dumb-guy chatter thats meant to bring relief to low-IQ audience members. He doesnt get metaphors see? ""Nothing goes over my head. My reflexes are too fast."" Hey Drax Joey Tribbiani thinks your shtick is old. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) in ""Guardians Of The Galaxy.""Photo Marvel As the gang of outlaws whizzes around the universe villains as fragile as Pringles line up to be obediently killed amid dialogue thats a jarring mix of fusty Conan-the-Barbarian-isms (""Spare me your foul gaze woman"") and bro talk (""They got my d -  - k message""). For background filler there are tunes from Peters beloved 70s pop mixtape. Out John Williams. In ""The Pina Colada Song."" The movie isnt a full-on spoof like ""A Million Ways To Die in Space."" Instead were actually supposed to get pumped up by the chaotic action the dazzlingly detailed special effects and the mortal combat with blue-faced villains with bits of circuit board or seaweed stuck to their faces. The comedy is meant to deflate tension that isnt there in the first place. Writer-director James Gunn keeps pulling the rug out without first bothering to trick anyone into standing on it. Chris Pratt plays Star-Lord a wise-cracking mercenary in ""Guardians Of The Galaxy.""Photo Marvel It all goes by as slowly as an IRS audit because theres no suspense We learn at the outset that the screenwriters will when stuck simply dream up some new problem-solving gadget or superpower and give it unexplained to whomever needs it. Floating in space for a few seconds will kill you unless it doesnt. Grasping an all-powerful golf ball of energy will destroy you except it wont. A large weapon will suddenly be tossed to the paws of the raccoon or the walking tree will form a magical birds nest of love around the whole crew to protect them from a crash landing. When in doubt cut to the potty-mouthed raccoon. Ha ha hes saying ""Holy s - - t"" or ""Attention idiots"" Straight out of ""Howard the Duck."" The one-liners in ""Star Wars"" an obvious inspiration got laughs while maintaining the illusion that the characters were in danger. Here a joke about ""Footloose"" does the opposite. Told that a legendary hero called Kevin Bacon saved the people who had sticks up their butts Saldanas character asks ""Who put the sticks up their butts?"" Its supposed to be Draxs job to be the sitcom cretin here but in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" theres so much stupid being delivered that everybody has to chip in.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday July 30 2014 949 PM Title Guardians of the Galaxy Film Info With Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Bradley Cooper. Interplanetary adventure about outcasts turned outlaws. Director James Gunn (201). PG-13 Violence intense action language. Area theaters. In Imax and 3-D where available. Calling ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" the perfect summer movie sounds like a backhanded compliment. Watch it at home in December and youll be just as charmed. It would be a shame to wait that long though because youd be missing out on a really good time. And the opportunity to see the movie in IMAX 3D which in this case is worth the splurge. Our guide through this irreverent ride is Chris Pratt ideally cast as interplanetary adventurer Peter Quill. He prefers to go by the more distinguished name of Star-Lord but this hasnt really caught on since he has never actually done anything distinguished. Zoe Saldana plays a fierce warrior in Guardians of the Galaxy. (Marvel UK via YouTube) That changes when he steals a mysterious but powerful orb which everyone seems to want. The evil Ronan (Lee Pace) and Korath (Djimon Hounsou) plan to use the sphere to rule the galaxy while the peaceful Nova Prime (Glenn Close) and Corpsman Dey (John C. Reilly) hope to protect everyone. The Collector (Benicio del Toro) just likes having cool stuff so hes after the globe too. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) head into action in ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" (Marvel) Star-Lord aims to sell the orb to the highest bidder but he has competition from other free agents. They include two motion-capture characters Rocket an antisocial raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his best friend Groot who happens to be a giant tree (Vin Diesel). Then theres Ronans fierce daughter Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Drax (Dave Bautista) one of Ronans former victims. Rocket Raccoon is voiced by Bradley Cooper in the sci-fi adventure Guardians of the Galaxy. Eventually these mismatched outcasts realize theyre better off working together -- if only because the rest of the universe seems to be working against them. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) has stolen a powerful orb that many others are after in ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" (Marvel UK via YouTube) Anyone familiar with Dan Abnett and Andy Lannings drolly offbeat Marvel comic series should be thrilled to see their characters fall into the hands of drolly offbeat director James Gunn (""Slither"" ""Super""). Gunn seems equally excited by the opportunity. He pairs his oversized budget and wide-eyed ambitions like hes the worlds most talented 10-year-old. This scrappy franchise isnt burdened by the expectations of big-name projects like ""The Avengers."" Its clear within every amped-up action scene unexpected effect and sweetly sentimental aside that the director embraced the chance to take some risks. Mimicking Rockets pack-rat tendencies Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman build their base from bits and pieces of pop culture. But while youll find references to everything from ""Star Wars"" to ""Serenity"" all backed by a carefully chosen retro soundtrack theyve successfully created their own world. To see an expensive big-studio movie freed from creative constraints and directorial cynicism is always a rare and wondrous experience. In a season of bloated indulgence its also fair to call it a marvel. eweitzmannydailynews.com ON A MOBILE DEVICE? CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO.

"Guardians of the Galaxy (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Guardians of the Galaxy (PG-13) Director James Gunns adaptation of the sci-fi Marvel Comics heroes is a blast. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com7/31/2014 Editor rating 3.5 Watching the zippy ebullient Guardians of the Galaxy you wonder ""Why cant all comic-book movies be this much fun?"" Granted a talking raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) would be out of place in the brooding Dark Knight pictures and a talking tree (Vin Diesel) that knows only three words -- ""I am Groot"" -- would have stood out against the somber backdrop of Man of Steel. But director James Gunn (Slither Super) has a luxury all those other movies didnt These characters are at least by Batman standards relatively obscure so there are no specific targets he needs to hit no specific origin stories he needs to tell. Most of all Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman are allowed to have fun with this crew of five likable star-hoppers which also includes the earthling Peter (Chris Pratt as funny here as he is in Parks and Recreation) the green-skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and the musclebound Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista). After a brief prologue that pays off beautifully later in the film Gunn thrusts you right into the story -- the usual business of interplanetary wars and power-hungry bad guys (Lee Pace) and a super Big Bad who will play a major role in the final Avengers picture (anyone familiar with Marvel Comics knows who Im talking about right now and is probably smiling). The pieces are all familiar -- a race to find a powerful gem a hero seeking vengeance on someone who wronged him a rascal whos in it mostly for himself until he learns the errors of his selfish ways -- but the way Gunn spins it Guardians of the Galaxy feels unlike any epic sci-fi adventure youve seen before. Yes its packed with the sorts of nerdy phrases and cliches that make the unconverted roll their eyes - planets with unpronounceable names bad guys who love to deliver speeches and improbable last-minute escapes. But the movie is also humorous and fast-paced with a careful structure that makes sure everything is there for a reason and the tone is goofy enough to incorporate songs such as Hooked on a Feeling Cherry Bomb and Im Not in Love into its plot. How many other Marvel Studios films can claim that? Thats not to say Gunn skimps on the cool eye-candy. There are some fantastic effects here from the photo-realistic talking raccoon to a wonderful scene in which hundreds of small fighter ships align themselves wingtip to wingtip to form a giant net to trap a larger spacecraft. Glenn Close shows up in a couple of scenes sporting a hairdo that looks like someone squeezed a tube of croissant putty on her head and there are enough casual references to the Marvel Universe to keep the diehards happy. Gunn doesnt take the material lightly -- the movie can get quite intense -- but he never forgets to have fun with it too. And unlike Joss Whedon who was saddled with characters who had already been shaped by other filmmakers Gunn can do whatever he wants with these intergalactic scamps including having them discuss the importance of Footloose (yes that Footloose) and how it relates to their dilemma. Guardians of the Galaxy burns through that comic-book burnout feeling that had started to dog the genre and reminds you how lively and energetic these films can be when treated with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek disrespect. The movie leaves you happy and energized and you also come away with a better understanding of the bigger picture Marvel is building with these films. Whether you have ever heard of the Guardians of the Galaxy matters not (I hadnt). Gunn makes this huge entertainment accessible to the converted and the neophyte alike and he has only has one goal To send you out of the theater with a fat smile on your face. Mission accomplished. Cast Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Dave Bautista Bradley Cooper (voice only) Vin Diesel (voice only) Lee Pace Michael Rooker John C. Reilly Glenn Close Benicio del Toro. Director James Gunn. Screenwriters James Gunn Nicole Perlman. A Marvel Studios release. Running time 121 minutes. Comic-book violence vulgar language. Playing at area theaters.

Theyre a motley crew of bickering bumbling mercenaries driven by self-interest. They may band together in the end but its rarely peaceful or pretty. The de facto leader of this assembly of intergalactic antiheroes is Peter Quill a cocky Terrian (i.e. earthling) who was hoovered up into space by a colossal spaceship when he was 8 and now introduces himself as ""Star-Lord"" to the derisive laughter of his snarling alien foes. Twenty-six years later hes grown into a swashbuckling fortune hunter with a maroon leather duster a vintage Walkman loaded with classic rock and a roguish sweet tooth for extraterrestrial hotties. Played with wily mischief by Chris Pratt hes like Han Solos more excitable less responsible nephew. Joining Quill in Marvels fizzy franchise kickoff are the green-skinned assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) the mumbly mound of muscles Drax the Destroyer (wrestler Dave Bautista whose physique is its own special effect) a rascally foul-mouthed raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and a walking tree creature called Groot whose only words are ""I am Groot"" (delivered through the gruff grunting tonsils of Vin Diesel). Directed with an effortlessly light touch by James Gunn a low-budget maestro of genre films such as 2006s Slither and 2010s Super Guardians of the Galaxy represents a risky proposition for Marvel on several levels a director whos never grappled with a project of this scale before a menagerie of comic-book characters who are hardly household names (even to fanboys) and a tongue-in-cheek B-movie vibe thats more Starcrash than Star Wars. But give Marvel props even with all of its mega-success; the studios still willing to take chances. Here that risk pays off big-time. The films a giddily subversive space opera that runs on self-aware smart-assery. The plot is hardly worth spelling out in too much detail. Im not sure I could do it justice anyway. Its the usual overstuffed action-adventure boilerplate about trying to retrieve a mystical MacGuffin -- a multilayered orb with the glowing power to destroy worlds -- from a sinister baddie (Lee Paces blue-hued Ronan the Accuser). Actually if Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman had just called the orb a tesseract youd basically be rewatching The Avengers. And theres such a mishmash of seemingly interchangeable alien names (Morag Thanos Yondu etc.) its tempting to tune out assume it will all make sense in the end and wait for the next bit of anarchic insult comedy from Pratt amp; Co. Unlike the sober Norse seriousness of Thor or the rah-rah retro-squareness of Captain America Quill and his posse of merry pranksters are such a delirious blast of laughing gas that Guardians feels more like an unofficial sequel to 1984s cult hit The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension than a Marvel product. (I mean that as a compliment.) A large share of the credit goes to Pratt. On TVs Parks and Recreation and in such big-screen features as Her and Delivery Man hes always provided a dependable jolt of joy-buzzer surprise in supporting roles. Now hes graduated to leading man -- the straw that stirs the drink -- and hes such a natural you cant help but wonder why it took so long. The other standout is Cooper who gives the motormouthed Rocket an outer-borough wiseguy honk and a hair-trigger temper. Hes like an R-rated Daffy Duck with a machine gun. Together theyre a gang of exiles from the planet of misfit toys. Or as Gamora generously calls them ""the biggest idiots in the galaxy."" Will they learn to overcome their selfishness and embrace responsibility for the first time in their lives? Of course they will. The genius of Gunns superhero send-up is its cheeky anything-goes absurdity. Ive been pretty mixed on Marvel movies over the years -- some have dazzled me others have left me depressed. But Guardians is the first one that feels excitingly unpredictable.

"Review Guardians of the Galaxy is a blast - Mercury News Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview Guardians of the Galaxy is a blastBy Randy MyersSan Jose Mercury News contributorPosted 07/30/2014 120000 PM PDTUpdated 07/31/2014 121612 PM PDT About this time every summer superhero burnout sets in.In this season alone weve seen our fair share of terrific comic-book-to-film creations from the smart ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" to the satisfying ""X-Men Days of Future Past."" Even if ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" failed to scale much of anything we now arrive at the month of August content in having witnessed a strong slate for fanboys and fangirls.Then along comes the summers most unexpected surprise -- the thoroughly captivating and breezily charming ""Guardians of the Galaxy.""In the rousing spirit of the original ""Star Wars"" this Marvel-Disney production unites a band of memorable misfits who bond together and discover the meaning of friendship while blasting off on a world-tripping adventure thats both deeply rooted in old-school tradition and uniquely in its own orbit. Is ""Guardians"" as pioneering as ""Star Wars""? No. But it is hugely satisfying and a full-bore blast of rambunctious fun.Director and co-writer James Gunn has effectively swooped in and spiked the summer movie seasons punch. His goofy but sweet 3-D superhero saga should fire up the chilly summer box office and establish Chris Pratt of TVs ""Parks and Recreation"" as a major league action star. Pratt is a likable and engaging on-screen presence and has impeccable comic timing as well as one impressively fit physique.Advertisement Based on a lesser-known Marvel comic book gang dreamed up by Arnold Drake and Gene Colan in 1969 ""Guardians"" chronicles what happens to the cocky Walkman-obsessed Peter Quill (Pratt) once he nabs a powerful orb that is sought by evil forces. To make certain that the prized possession doesnt fall into the clutches of the despicable Ronan (Lee Pace) who wants it for his own dastardly intentions the braggart Peter joins forces with an offbeat crew as lovable as it is unruly.It includes Gamora (Zoe Saldana) an assassin with ties to Ronan and an uber-rotten daddy figure Thanos; Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) an incredible hulk with a thirst for literalness and vengeance; Groot (Vin Diesel) a tree-human hybrid who can only say ""I am Groot"" but expresses deeper-rooted sentiments; and -- my favorite and probably yours -- Rocket (Bradley Cooper) a raccoon thats been genetically tampered with whos trigger-happy sarcastic and vulnerable. Each actor is well cast with Cooper particularly noteworthy as he brings just the right mix of vocal swagger and emotion to Rocket. And while Diesel doesnt have extensive dialogue by any means his tree character is fully developed. Marvels Guardians Of The Galaxy are from left Chris Pratt as Star-Lord/Peter Quill Vin Diesal as Groot Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket Raccoon Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer and Zoe Saldana as Gamora. (Marvel/MCT) ( HANDOUT ) Most in this band of outsiders talk tough but each is a survivor with emotional wounds. Its this human element in an alien environment that distinguishes ""Guardians"" and makes it touching. While Gunn along with his special-effect teams has meticulously created vibrant and visually spectacular new worlds (its worth paying for the 3-D version) the emotional needs of characters receive equal priority. Gunn and co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman give us tender moments when you least expect them especially in the films opening when a young Peter (Wyatt Oleff) is waiting at a hospital where his mother is dying.These touches along with judiciously applied irreverent humor make ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" much more enjoyable than more calculated comic-book movie series such as the uninspired ""Spider-Man"" sequel and even the latest ""Thor"" movie. In fact its better than ""Iron Man 3."" Equally as refreshing is the innocence in ""Guardians."" Absent from this new franchise -- a sequel has been announced -- is the cynical worldview that dominates so much of entertainment on big and small screens. Pessimism and paranoia dont rule the day even when the world of Xandar and the galaxy itself come under an imminent threat that leads Nova Prime (Glenn Close in full-wig mode) to lean on our misfit team.What ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" reminds us is that heroes often emerge from the most unlikely sources. The same could be said for a summer comic-book movie that effortlessly makes you feel like a wide-eyed happy kid again.GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY    Rating PG-13 (intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action some language)Cast Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana Dave Bautista Vin Diesel Bradley Cooper Lee PaceDirector and co-writer James GunnRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesPrint Email Font ResizeReturn to Top RELATED MORE RELATED HEADLINES Review Holocaust haunts family in The GatheringReview In Hearts of Palm bumbling corporation aims to plunder paradiseReview In Bad Moms fast food and booze spike the stress of motherhood Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=""https//disqus.com/?ref_noscript"">comments powered by Disqus.</a> ( T.

"Guardians of the Galaxy | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; guardians-of-the-galaxy ) Guardians of the Galaxy (United States 2014) July 30 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Guardians of the Galaxy represents Marvels great experiment a major motion picture based on a comic book series not featuring any ""household name"" superheroes. It takes place in outer space a setting where few action/adventure movies have found traction in recent years. Although it remains to be seen whether this will represent a shrewd movie on the part of Marvel or a significant misstep the resultant production is engaging for the most part and highly reminiscent of the wave of post-Star Wars space operas that emerged during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The vibe if not the specifics is highly reminiscent of The Last Starfighter Battlestar Galactica Battle Beyond the Stars and others. The fact that the movies ""present"" is defined as being 1988 and the soundtrack is peppered with 70s tunes cements the retro feeling. The action takes place not that long ago but definitely far away although the opening scenes are on Earth. Peter Quill (played by Wyatt Olef as a child and Chris Pratt as an adult) is abducted by aliens shortly after his mother dies of cancer. He grows up as part of a band of intergalactic thieves and smugglers and the first time we meet him as a man (with the code name of ""Star Lord"") hes stealing an orb. It turns out that seemingly everyone wants the orb terrorist Ronan (Lee Pace) who wants to use it to obliterate his enemies the Xandarans; Thanos (Josh Brolin) the warlord who can use it to attain mastery over the universe; The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) who covets all rare and powerful items; and many lesser entities who plan to sell it. After being arrested and imprisoned (and having the orb taken away from him) Quill is forced into an uneasy alliance with several of his fellow inmates Gamora (Zoe Saldana) an ""adopted daughter"" of Thanos; Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) a literal minded mountain of a man who seeks revenge against Ronan; Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) a genetically engineered raccoon with a bad temper and a love of guns; and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) an Ent-like creature who speaks only one line ""I am Groot."" The five remain united after their prison break in order to retrieve the orb and keep it away from Ronan. The basic narrative of Guardians of the Galaxy is the kind of light popcorn fare that comic books (and their spin-off products) can get away with. The plot is riddled with seeming inconsistencies (although Im sure die-hard fans can explain all the limitations constraining the supposedly all-powerful orb) and a lot of threads are left dangling (presumably for exploration in the already-greenlit sequel). However the characters develop a nice rapport the dialogue crackles with wit and the 70s songs add an element of freshness to the proceedings. The anticlimactic resolution which relies in part on an unfortunate instance of corny physical humor is a bit of a letdown but thats often the case with superhero movies where the journey is more entertaining than the destination. Visually the movie overdoses on CGI - it looks a lot like the Star Wars prequels (although director James Gunn has indicated he mixed in so-called practical effects). The two non-humanoid members of the team were created entirely by computer. Groot the walking tree-like entity whose voice is provided by Vin Diesel is a triumph of artistry. A similar comment can be made about Rocket who looks almost like a raccoona| but not quite. The 3-D falls into the ""neutral"" range of the spectrum in that it neither enhances nor detracts from the overall experience. With the exception of Lee Pace whose Ronan isnt as nasty as one might hope for a big bad villain the cast is well-chosen. Chris Pratt brings a mix of Han Solo-inspired bravado and Luke Skywalker-influenced heroism to his part. Zoe Saldana adding green skin to her resume (after having been blue-skinned in Avatar) is effectively tough and conflicted as Gamora and her chemistry with Pratt generates the right amount of heat. Dave Bautistas Drax who comes across like a semi-eloquent Hulk provides some comic relief without going over-the-top. Actors in secondary roles include Michael Rooker as the bandit lord Yondu (whose weaponry is very cool); Karen Gillan as Nebula Ronans hench(wo)man; and Glenn Close as the leader of Xandars military. Josh Brolins interpretation of Thanos makes us wish that he instead of Ronan had been the main villain. Despite a variety of unresolved narrative elements Guardians of the Galaxy is sufficiently self-contained to work as a stand-alone film even though the goal is to make this the starting point for a long-running franchise. Guardians of the Galaxy is immersed in a characteristic evident in The Avengers--related movies (but not found in most other major comic book films) irreverence. By not taking anything too seriously it allows cheesy plot elements to work where they might fail in another context. Guardians of the Galaxy is solid summer fun - not the mammoth epic we have come to expect from each new Marvel release but a welcome entry into a moribund movie season.

Entertainment ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" Is The Most Winningly Weird Superhero Movie Of The Summer Marvels oddball adaptation is one of its more obscure properties but it turns out to be an incredibly good time. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic Marvel Studio Zoe Saldana Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket Chris Pratt Vin Diesel as the voice of Groot and Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy. ID 3499291 Guardians of the Galaxy based on a comic book most civilians have never heard of is set almost entirely in space and features a talking raccoon and a sentient tree. In short its easily the most bizarre superhero movie youll see this summer. Its goofy self-aware and even though its also about larger-than-life characters saving the universe it feels nothing like its fellow Marvel films. And that turns out to be a good thing -- Guardians of the Galaxy which opens this Friday Aug. 1 is a giddy blast of fresh air an exercise in unfettered glee that leaves behind all the angst and self-seriousness to revel in just how freakin cool the adventures its chronicling are. Heres why it works so well. ID 3498299 It doesnt have to worry about fitting into a larger story. View this image > Marvel Studios ID 3496152 Guardians of the Galaxy technically takes place in a world that many light-years away also contains Captain America Iron Man Nick Fury and their various allies lovers and foes. And at some future date (perhaps around the third Avengers installment) Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and his pals may end up intersecting with the behemoth of cross-platform storytelling and branding that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But for now Guardians of the Galaxy is unfettered and free from obligations to be anything other than a dorky space opera adventure in which a collection of criminals teams up to guard the galaxy from destruction (as promised) but mostly to have a good time. It takes place in an intergalactic realm that feels deeply influenced by sci-fi of the 70s and 80s but thats also literally about the 70s and 80s littered with nods to troll dolls and Flashdance and set to a cassette mixtape soundtrack of the eras creakiest pop hits. It feels like the dream of a kid who grew up gazing at fantasy landscapes on metal lunch boxes and fraying posters who obsessed over the Star Wars cantina scene and who then got to unload the contents of his mind on screen into a snappy saga of space battles alien species snarky quips and a well-loved Sony Walkman. ID 3499195 Its not overly reverent about its source material. View this image > Marvel Studios ID 3497603 Guardians of the Galaxy was directed by bona fide geek James Gunn who wrote the screenplay with Nicole Perlman. Gunn who began his career working with the legendary schlockmeisters at Troma Entertainment went on to make two indies that deconstructed their genres while remaining inherently true to them 2006s Slither was a disturbing funny movie about an alien parasite that also skewered small town life while 2010s Super which starred Rainn Wilson and Ellen Page offered a very (very) darkly comic twist on superheroes. Gunns not precious about prodding at the workings of the things he loves -- and the source material for Guardians of the Galaxy is a deep enough cut comic book-wise that he doesnt have to worry about being too meticulously faithful to whats been put on the page. Rocket the cybernetically enhanced racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick Groot the tree-thing (voiced by Vin Diesel who only says variations on the line ""I am Groot"") work because the movie isnt too careful with them -- theyre a dickish loudmouth and a sweet-tempered brute in unconventional forms. And Peter is half-reluctant hero and half-fan himself a good-natured space dirtbag secretly thrilled to find himself exploring forgotten planets and banging hot extraterrestrials. The title card plays over a wide shot of him dancing in headphones to Redbones ""Come and Get Your Love"" in the midst of an abandoned alien landscape. When he finds himself in possession of a mysterious orb that multiple parties are willing to kill for he notes it has certain Ark of the Covenant/Maltese Falcon MacGuffin qualities. He tries to get people to call him Star-Lord. (It doesnt work.) ID 3499229 It doesnt sweat the small stuff. Lee Pace Marvel Studios Karen Gillan Marvel Studios ID 3497829 Being self-aware without being self-mocking is a tricky line to walk but Guardians of the Galaxy (mostly) makes it look easy. Peter snatched up from Earth on the night of his mothers death by space scavengers led by Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) grows up to be an exuberant womanizing thief. Gamora (a green Zoe Saldana) Rocket and Groot are tasked by different people to track down Peter. They end up in jail together where they partner with grieving warrior Drax the Destroyer (played by wrestler Dave Bautista) to retrieve the orb. Gamoras complicated backstory about being one of the adopted daughters of a villainous-but-mostly-background-being named Thanos (Josh Brolin) is brushed over quickly as are the motivations of the movies primary baddie Ronan (Lee Pace) whos some sort of goth-y fundamentalist intent on maintaining a war everyone else wants over. Guardians of the Galaxy leaves Ronan and his sidekick Nebula (Karen Gillan) one of Gamoras equally hard-ass siblings a little thin as far as antagonists go but that doesnt really matter -- its how the Guardians interact thats most important. The movie travels to different planets and mining colonies and includes one apparently de rigueur fight involving a giant aircraft above a city but its greatest moments are character beats. Pratt may now be in possession of an impressive six pack but hes still a comic actor and Peters smirkiness is infectious the guiding sentiment behind the action. Prickly and not easily charmed Gamora gives Saldana less to work with but the character doesnt fall so quickly in line as the expected romantic interest and she gets a few laugh-out-loud moments herself. Bautista shows some unexpected comic timing in playing a member of a species that doesnt understand metaphor leading to him taking everything completely literally. (""Nothing goes over my head"" he notes proudly. ""My reflexes are too fast."") ID 3499234 View this image > Marvel Studios ID 3499001 But its Rocket and Groot who are the most captivatingly offbeat the dynamic between them like some sci-fi answer to Of Mice and Men without the sense of impending doom. Groot barely speaks but he generates some giggles thanks to his expression and timing alone. And he may be the character who makes the least sense in a pretty nonsensical bunch but Rocket ends up being the voice of reason more often than hed like scrubbing his face in frustration like a scowling New Yorker trapped in the body of an intelligent raccoon. When the movie makes one of its sparing attempts to delve into real emotion its Rocket of all people/animals whos able to summon some pathos. That a talking weapon-wielding animals tears turn out to be moving is proof of how compelling Guardians of the Galaxys crazy universe really is. It may be a wonderfully nutty adventure but its not without a heart.

Chris Pratt plays a space outlaw in search of a mysterious orb; a rollicking good time follows.A scene form ""Guardians of the Galaxy.""(Photo Marvel)Story HighlightsCritics review 4.5 starsThere are no huge stars so its easy for the actors to sink into their roles.Each actor takes things exactly as seriously as he or she should.Gunn sets the perfect tone from the start and Pratt and the rest of the cast follow his lead.Woo-hooMuch time and space will be spent trying to explain why ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is so much fun and why you should rush right out to see James Gunns hilarious thrilling and occasionally moving () film but really ""woo-hoo"" just about covers it.The film is based on a lesser Marvel comic (lesser than say the ""Avengers"" juggernaut) and part of its charm lies therein. The same goes for the casting no huge names no ""whats that actor doing in a comic-book movie"" questions and that works to great advantage. Maybe you know Chris Pratt from ""Parks and Recreation"" but hes not a huge star so its easy for him to sink into the role of Peter Quill.(Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel also are in the movie but only their voices.)Quill is a human who winds up for reasons youll see in the movie as a galactic thief who wishes people would call him Star-Lord.Almost nobody does.AZCENTRALAll the reviews Weekend movie guide for PhoenixQuill has lots of cool gadgets that keep him (mostly) out of trouble. But he also totes around an old Sony Walkman with a 70s mix tape as its only choice of music. This tape is important because A) it is important to Quill B) its important to the story and C) its awesome.Dont undersell that last point. The whole movie is awesome; Gunn relentlessly throws fun at the screen and almost all of it sticks. Hes aiming to please here and he hits his mark repeatedly.Quill captures then loses then must retrieve a mysterious orb that naturally bad guys want. Like destroy-the-universe bad guys. This gets Quill into trouble (John C. Reilly is hilarious in a small role as a galactic cop) and he is sentenced along with others more or less involved in the orb quest to a grim prison.There is Gamora (Zoe Saldana) who has her own reasons for wanting the orb; Rocket Raccoon (voice of Cooper) a mutant with a smart mouth and a knack for electronics; Groot (voice of Diesel) a treelike creature who provides muscle for Rocket; and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista) a hyperliteral hypermuscled fellow who wants revenge more than camaraderie.AZCENTRALGuardians of the Galaxy soundtrack Listen anticipateTheyre after a bad guy named Ronan (Lee Pace) which is a classic bad-guy name in the way that pretty much everything about the movie has inspiration in the tried-and-true. You might spend time bogging yourself down in the ""Star Wars"" bits or the ""Avengers"" vibe but really youd be much better off just laughing.Its no great spoiler to say that the ragtag gang busts out of prison (the title isnt ""Guardians of the Cellblock""). The rest of the movie is the group chasing after the orb Ronan chasing after them and variations on that combination. That part isnt really important. Nor is a love of science fiction. This movie could take place anywhere -- anywhere there is rollicking entertainment available for your pleasure.The acting is spot-on with everyone taking things just as seriously as they should which means something different for Pratt than it does for Bautista for instance. (Bautista is the sleeper star of the film laugh-out-loud hilarious.)Its easy to get carried away with movies like this which lend themselves to fanboy hype. Its not a perfect movie. But it is one that is hugely enjoyable bears repeated viewings and will be as funny in 10 years (or 50) as it is now.And thats pretty swell.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Guardians of the Galaxy follows an American pilot Peter Quill who is forced to band together with a group of misfits after accidentally stealing an orb coveted by Ronan an evil space creature.

(   out of four; rated PG-13 opening Thursday night in some theaters and Friday nationwide).No need to be a sci-fi nerd or a comic book geek to enjoy it the witty banter and charismatic characters will delight general audiences. Even if the biggest laughs come courtesy of a talking raccoon and the more poignant moments involve a monosyllabic tree.Still theres a distinctly human element to draw audiences. Chris Pratt is terrific in the lead role of Peter Quill an irreverent intergalactic outlaw.USA TODAYGuardians protects its emotional core amid the actionUSA TODAYSummers out-of-this-world duo Rocket and GrootUSA TODAYThe latest movie reviewsFollowing the death of his mother in 1988 when he was just a boy Peter is abducted from Earth by aliens. Growing up among a motley crew of scavengers headed by Yondu (Michael Rooker) all Peter has left of his beloved mom is a mix tape of her favorite songs.When the film opens Peter an overgrown adolescent is listening to one of those tunes and bopping around alone. He stumbles on a mysterious orb that comes with a substantial bounty.Orb in tow he soon tangles with green assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) the adopted daughter of tyrannical Titan Thanos (Josh Brolin) and meets the wisecracking bounty hunter Rocket a genetically-engineered raccoon (cleverly voiced by Bradley Cooper) and the feisty furballs sentient side-plant the kindly Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel).After some disorderly behavior the unlikely quartet winds up in jail rounded up by a Nova Corps officer (John C. Reilly) who answers to head honcho Nova Prime (Glenn Close). Once there they tangle with the vengeful Drax (Dave Bautista) who is hell-bent on killing Gamora but eventually joins forces with the four. Their coordinated prison break is especially entertaining.Everyones eye is on the prized orb especially the megalomaniacal Ronan (Lee Pace) who plans to use it for interstellar domination.Other villainous sorts pop up in the form of Korath (Djimon Hounsou) the Collector (Benicio Del Toro) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) but their characters dont seem fully fleshed out. Paces villainous Ronan makes the most indelible impression.The plot occasionally becomes overstuffed perhaps packing in extraneous elements in order to set up future installments. Yet the zany script by director James Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman is sharply funny.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Guardians of the Galaxy follows an American pilot Peter Quill who is forced to band together with a group of misfits after accidentally stealing an orb coveted by Ronan an evil space creature. VPCMeeting a fresh crew of comic book heroes is a bona fide treat after so many super-hero sequels. With its dazzling settings Guardians harks back to the inventive feel of the original Star Wars. Like that 1977 classic the key characters are folks you enjoy spending a couple hours getting to know.The five have an offbeat chemistry anchored by Pratts smart-alecky charm. Newly buff he can pull off the heroic action sequences as well as some adorable dance moves to the movies catchy soundtrack. He also communicates the characters emotional shading conveying vulnerability as effectively as he does plucky bravado.USA TODAYUSA TODAYs guide to summer moviesSaldana is a top-tier female action star. She blends smarts and physicality in a way that works ideally for her character. She doesnt get many humorous lines but Cooper voices Rocket so adeptly and provides so many laughs that it seems churlish to point out who didnt get to be funny. Rocket and Diesels Groot steal scenes from the flesh-and-blood types but Bautistas Drax also is a hoot. A clunky literalist with an annoying inability to understand the simplest metaphor he is responsible for some of the movies most winning wordplay.With its introduction of wonderfully memorable characters and blend of humor action and catchy tunes Guardians is perfectly pitched escapist fun. 175 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 5 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1rPXyMr",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/07/30/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review/12786911/,200,guardiansofthegalaxy37,guardiansofthegalaxy,usatoday

He takes off his high-tech mask. Looks around. Pauses. And then grooving to the tape on his carefully preserved Walkman boogies down to that 70s guilty pleasure ""Come and Get Your Love."" And thats when we see what ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is doing. And know that it knows exactly what its doing. On one most obvious level of course its digging deep beneath Marvels fertile but definitely overfarmed topsoil to uncover some of its more outre offerings. Getting a little jaded with iron men and mutant teens? OK well how about a slacker spaceman? A walking tree? A cyber raccoon? Does that get your attention? And if not how about a lot more comedy than youre used to in these movies and a bit more sex? Zoe Saldana sure makes it look easy being green in Guardians of the GalaxyMARVEL Not that ""Guardians"" is raunchy. But it gets away with as much as it can (there are a few almost-pronounced four-letter words and a flipped finger). And it feels like Peter could probably show even Captain James T. Kirk a thing or two about going to bed with a thing or two. But on another deeper level ""Guardians"" is a serious tribute to pop culture. Quills doesnt love old top-40 rock because hes being ironic; he loves it because it reminds him of his dead mother. He cherishes it because as artificial as it can be it connects with him in a very real way. The movie knows that junk art is still art that no one is more in need of something to speak for them than the inarticulate -- and with that it takes the secret pull of comic geekdom and elevates it to a kind of bittersweet obsessive romanticism. The plot -- well thats a bit of a fall back to the Marvel comfort zone where some not-very-interesting villain wants to destroy the cosmos or a good chunk of it for some not-very-clear reasons. Of course first he needs to get his hands on some fabulous ancient power source; its up to the good guys to stop him. And really how many times has that script been dusted off? Its more Mad Libs than Marvel with blanks to fill in the new names. Except this time the names are ones like Rocket (that streetwise almost-a-raccoon) and Groot the walking talking tree (well semi-talking -- all hes learned to say is ""I am Groot""). And Gamora (with Zoe Saldana once again as a kick-butt alien) and the lethal Drax (with fighter Dave Bautista as a kind of Tor Johnson whos in on the joke). The star though -- and this is definitely the movie that makes him one -- is Chris Pratt. Hes developed a six-pack (or maybe even an eight-pack) to do his one obligatory shirtless scene as the hero and in some ways thats a shame; it would add to Peters real-guyness if he was just a little less of Han Solo and a little more of a stoner schlub. But Pratt whos been happily coasting along for awhile in rom-coms as the heros best-bud no-worries sidekick is absolutely charming here and definitely ready to move up to the next stage in his career -- that is if he can remember to set his alarm and make the meeting. Sadly the chief villains are a little forgettable as they often are in Marvel films while Bradley Cooper is a slight disappointment as the voice of Rocket; what the film needed was a quintessentially authentic New Yorker like Christopher Walken or Harvey Keitel. (Seriously dream casting? Martin Scorsese.) But director Gunn -- who also made the low-budget satire ""Super"" and the underrated horror movie ""Slither"" -- is good with his large cast. Hes also good with the action sequences particularly the one-on-one fights; the more complicated they become with dozens of spaceships filling the screen the more removed from real emotion they get. But ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" isnt about that kind of scale. Its about the lazy comfort of underachieving (and the nagging guilt that maybe you should be doing more). Its about the sloppy squabbles of friendship (and the realization that despite them those bonds matter and only grow). Its about finding real honest emotion in a stupid Top 40 song. And its about -- well its about the best summer blockbuster this year. Ratings note The film contains some strong language adult material and violence. Guardians of the Galaxy (PG-13) Disney (121 min.) Directed by James Gunn. With Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana and the voice of Bradley Cooper.

On the plus side James Gunns Guardians of the Galaxy adapted from the Marvel comic book series of the same name has a sense of humor about itself Even when characters strut around dropping hefty expository bundles like ""Ronan is destroying Xanderian outposts throughout the galaxy"" they do so with a wink. But by the end youll have been winked at so much you may think youve been staring at a strobe light for nearly two hours. Guardians of the Galaxy is proof that a picture can have a sense of humor yet have no real wit. It hits every beat but it hasnt got the beat. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - See also ""A Note to the Guardians of the Galaxy Fans Who Are Calling Our Critic a Harlot""You might be fooled into thinking otherwise at the beginning. Guardians opens with a flashback preamble detailing a key episode in the childhood of our hero Peter Quill (played as a youngster by Wyatt Oleff) His mother dying in a hospital begs him to take her hand; he recoils only to be filled with remorse seconds later when she draws her last breath. The totem he clings to is a mixtape of ""Awesome Music"" shes made for him filled with rad-pop treasures from her own youth and maybe from yours too like the Raspberries ""Go All the Way"" and 10ccs ""Im Not in Love."" Cut to Quill as a brawny space-roaming grown-up now played by Chris Pratt Hes still listening to that tape and we see him headphones clamped to his ears swaggering through a dazzling surreal blue-green alien landscape -- rife with obnoxious scampering lizards which he impatiently kicks out of the way -- to the strains of Redbones ""Come and Get Your Love.""Film Details Guardians of the Galaxy RatingPG-13 GenreAction/Adventure Running Time122 min. More Info Trailer Fun Right? Actually that early sequence almost is fun though its just a little too self-aware too pleased with itself to work. Later our rogue space scavenger Quill is joined in his exploits by green-skinned butt-kicker Gamora (Zoe Saldana) beefcake-y tattooed chrome-dome Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista) and an unlikely duo of soldiers of fortune cranky talking-raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his bark-covered sidekick Groot (Vin Diesel) a thinking feeling ambulatory plant form with exceedingly sad slightly watery eyes. Naturally none of these characters likes one another much at first. But they quickly realize that five heads and 12 legs are the bare minimum needed to prevent the villainous stripey-face Ronan (Lee Pace) from destroying the galaxy. Also at one point theyll have to take a meeting with Glenn Close in a winter-white pretzel hairdo and thats seriously scary.Gunn has to juggle so many plot elements in Guardians of the Galaxy -- so many booming galactic battles so many whisker-close brushes with death so many almost-poignant moments of epiphany -- that its little wonder he loses his grip on the thing. Then again he and Nicole Perlman wrote the script (adapting it from the comic books by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning) so they bear some responsibility for its top-heaviness. Gunn inserts occasional moments of wonder -- in the most effective one a character makes a sacrificial act to save the others as twinkling lights ostensibly representing compassion and generosity dot the frame. But he doesnt bother to smooth over the seams. Time and again he cues us what to feel which is different from creating the perfect weather conditions for it and then stepping back.What really kills the fun -- as opposed to the Fun -- of Guardians of the Galaxy is its desperation to be casual and quirky and irreverent nearly every minute. Groot and Rocket are admittedly well designed Rocket with his expressively raggedy fur comes off as a crotchety refugee from Fantastic Mr. Fox. And the perpetually sorrowful Groot his arms and legs a tangle of art nouveau roots strikes the right balance between somber elegance and whimsy. (Diesel makes the most of the single growly line Groot repeats throughout the movie -- ""Im Groot"" -- turning it into a lament or a declaration as needed.) Oddly enough these CGI-created characters are the most naturalistic element of Guardians of the Galaxy. Otherwise the movie works so hard to advertise its disreputability that it comes off as anything but. At one point Quill not-so-subtly flips the bird to an intergalactic cop putting an old schoolboys trick to use. Pratt -- an actor with a degree of rakish charm -- feigns innocence at his own naughtiness and the moment is almost funny. But though Quill is ostensibly a lady-killer who swears like a sailor on shore leave hes repeatedly forced to use the distractingly demure term ""a-hole."" The saltier full-strength version would surely give offense to the dark lords of the MPAA who would in their wrath snatch away his movies PG-13 rating. Its all just too precious for words. Especially those four-letter ones.Correction The abbreviated ""capsule"" version of this review was originally published in this space. This is the full review.

Comics will forever be indebted to the genres ""silver age"" and its most important writer Stan Lee. The 91-year-old Lee is a credited producer on this film (and makes a blink-and-youll-miss-it cameo) and his spirit is felt every time a character opens their mouth. But ""Guardians"" is still a modern movie. Its hero Peter Quill (who works to get the sobriquet ""Star-Lord"" to catch on) is in this incarnation an 80s kid zapped up to space upon the death of his mother. Hence he clutches his old cassette walkman (loaded with inherited AM Gold 70s pop tunes) as his sole connection to Earth. We meet the adult Quill as a ""ravager"" somewhere between an Indiana Jones adventurer and a nasty pirate. As he traipses the alien landscape of Morag in search of ""The Orb"" a gorgeous vista straight from the covers of ""Analog Science Fiction and Fact"" hes shaking his booty to the one-hit wonder ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone. This blend of classic sci-fi fare and current pop-culture irony is what rockets ""Guardians"" into the stratosphere. Its not quite a joke-fest like 80s cult classic ""The Ice Pirates"" but its light years from the grim reality of ""Man of Steel."" And I really cant understand the mindset of anyone who isnt completely won over. The plot to ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is even more inscrutable than ""Thor The Dark World."" Weve reached a point with these movies that the only way to truly know whats happening in each scene is to have a pre-existing awareness of Marvel lore or to be 10 years old and just not care. One must allow oneself to get caught up in the propulsive nature of these things. The movie is really just a stitched-together series of set pieces - finding the Macguffin escaping capture breaking out of prison getting the band back together getting double-crossed facing personal demons accepting personal sacrifice yada yada yada. Luckily ""Guardians"" doubles down on the draw of its lovable characters. Chris Pratts Han Solo-ish Star-Lord is working with a great team. At his side is potential love interest Gamora a butt-whooper and ""daughter"" of uber-villain Thanos. Shes the voice of reason given to rolling her eyes in an extremely charming manner. The dumb muscle of the group is Drax the Destroyer played by WWE Superstar Dave Batista who consistently gets the biggest laughs in the film. In addition to being an enormous block of concrete he hails from a planet without metaphor so each of flat baritone lines are laden with ""Coneheads""-like syntax. Then theres Rocket and Groot. In fantasy and fiction weve got Kirk and Spock weve got Batman and Robin weve got Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (the Stones are too cool to be real right?) and now weve got Rocket and Groot. Am I overselling it? Maybe I am. Or maybe ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is merely the first peek at the bromance between a hotheaded talking raccoon and sentient tree weve all been waiting for. Bradley Cooper (voicing Rocket) is really quite perfect as the genetically enhanced rodent/bounty hunter who begins the film on Star-Lords trail. Hes got a lot of anger issues but they manifest as being mostly a pest - like a darker interstellar Bart Simpson. His Chewbacca (and theres no use denying Chewbacca is the template) is Groot a happy tree that is loyal kind and powerful as all hell. Praise is certainly owed to Vin Diesel who recorded Groots only line (replace Chewys raaaaggrh with the phrase ""I am Groot"") but lets not overlook the obvious. These movies are crafted by a gargantuan team of animators and entire rooms filled with computer databanks. This legion of overworked and under-appreciated craftspeople really knocked it out of the park with Groot. Well never know who exactly supplied the spark that makes this smiling collection of sticks so special but somewhere in those thousands of processing hours a little bit of magic happened. While superhero movies (and the Marvel Cinematic Universe in particular) is a warm spot for me Ill allow that some moments of pre-viz heavy action does feel a little rote. There was an instant during some pod-chasing on The Collectors adopted casino planet of Knowhere where the action lost me for a minute. Those less forgiving than I may whip out the oft-repeated cry of ""these movies all look the same."" I cant argue against the complaint that all the action is shot the same but the alien races spaceships and sets in ""Guardians"" are all quite remarkable. Alas composer Tyler Bates new to Marvel doesnt break the streak of being unremarkable. Would it kill Marvel to have a memorable score once in a while? Other consumerist notes the 3D only has one shining moment (so much Groot in my face) but by-and-large it doesnt earn the upsell. The projection I saw was frustratingly dark as a result of the cheapo glasses handed to me. Also this movie is a little heavy for kids. It opens with scenes of a mom dying of cancer and has more than its share of S-bombs. Something to consider if you were hoping to bring the young uns. But for those in the 13-year-old age range? Forgetaboutit. Theyll be saying ""I am Groot"" from now til Christmas.

(AP Photo/Disney - Marvel) Print Email The Associated Press By The Associated Press The Associated Press on July 28 2014 at 514 PM updated July 28 2014 at 520 PM comments The film is terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" a Walt Disney Studios release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action and some language."" Running time 121 minutes. Two stars out of four. By JAKE COYLE AP Film Writer At the height of their powers our overlords at Marvel have deigned to prove like an emperor tolerating a court jester that they do in fact have a sense of humor. The Marvel universe of course isnt entirely lacking comedy as weve seen in ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers."" But on the whole the Marvel kingdom is built on an unshakable foundation of self-seriousness. The comic book studio seems to fear that if the solemnity of its fiction isnt diligently guarded people might start questioning whether all these men in spandex merit quite so much attention. Yet ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" a 3-D space opera about a ragtag crew of mercenaries is Marvels most irreverent film yet and has a welcome slightly self-mocking tone that dares to suggest intergalactic battles over orbs might actually be a tad silly. This is all very much to the good but the problem with ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" directed by James Gunn is the weakness of the comedy it wears so proudly. It takes more than a soundtrack full of 70s tunes a talking raccoon and a few gags about ""Footloose"" to be funny. Its ""zany"" in quotes. As if demonstrating its tonal distance from Marvels other planetary bodies ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" takes place at the far reaches of space where we find Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) skipping along on an abandoned planet. He removes his mask presses play on a Walkman and does something normally sacrosanct in Marvel-land He dances. Blaring is the irresistible 1974 hit ""Come and Get Your Love"" by Redbone the first of many such old radio hits. The music as we learned in the prologue is from a mixtape given to Quill as a child by his cancer-stricken mother shortly before her death. Distraught he rushes outside only to -- in quite the double-whammy -- be beamed up by a spaceship. Twenty-six years later Quill is a Han Solo-like scavenger who stumbles across a silver orb also sought by some powerfully evil forces Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace obscured by makeup but still a severe presence) and his boss Thanos (Josh Brolin). The warm spirit of ""Guardians"" owes much to Pratt the guileless formerly doughy ""Parks and Recreation"" star; his casting in inspired. The resulting scrum for the orb introduces several more seekers the green-skinned Gamora (Zoe Saldana) the hulking Drax (Dave Bautista) and a CGI odd couple a bitterly sardonic raccoon named Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick a talking tree called Groot (Vin Diesel) who looks like he sprouted from ""The Lord of the Rings."" All reluctantly unite like a sarcastic ""Dirty Dozen."" The Guardians who were first introduced in a 1969 comic are far from Marvels star players. But their not-primetime-player status is freeing to Gunn whose 2010 comedy ""Super"" starred Rainn Wilson as a wannabe crime fighter. He wrote the film with Nicole Perlman clearly aspiring for a rollicking adventure in the mold of ""Indiana Jones"" or ""Star Wars"" which the movies poster evoked. But the film is terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects. Presumably awaiting meatier work sequels to come fine actors like Glenn Close John C. Reilly and Benicio Del Toro come and go with just a few lines. (How can a movie seeking humor in outer space not utilize Reilly?) The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness and ""Guardians"" depends all too much on the whimsy of 70s anthems for an original beat. Others eager for any playfulness from Marvel will surely be more excited by ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" To them I quote Solo ""Laugh it up Fuzzball.""

Or rather its like a vast family-sized festive crate of chocolates all wrapped in the shiniest packaging all exploding with sweetness and surprises. Maybe there are a couple of flavours you dont much care for and after a while it all starts to get a bit dizzying but you stuff yourself anyway coming up bloated and satisfied on the other side. Based on one of Marvel Comics lesser known franchises this is the tale of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) an earthling abducted as a boy who a quarter of a century later is working as a Han Solo-style outlaw-for-hire under the self-ordained nickname Star-Lord. When his quest for a mysterious orb attracts the attention of some blue-skinned intergalactic troublemakers Quill throws in with a team of fellow outsiders including green-skinned warrior princess Gamora (Zoe Saldana) genetically enhanced raccoon Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) comically literal man-mountain Drax (Dave Bautista) and a self-regenerating semi-sentient walking tree named Groot (Vin Diesel typecast again). Theres a basic good-v-evil plot in here somewhere but its rendered largely impenetrable by a profusion of Marvel-verse asides which will only make sense to those who have followed the mythology across the entire comic and film franchise (some conversations seem to consist entirely of silly names jumbled up at random). No matter - the rest of us can just sit back and enjoy the ride as the film ricochets from one dazzling frazzling action set-piece to the next pausing only to charm our socks off with another pithy retort classic bubblegum-pop hit or cutely random alien character. Some may find the films self-satisfaction a mite grating - Pratt is likeable but hes no Harrison Ford however hard he tries - and there are moments where the sheer brain-melting relentlessness becomes wearying. But overall this is giddy ridiculous fun a witty wacky and wonderfully generous sugary gift of a film.

Daily Edition Login to download Guardians of the Galaxy Film Review 100 PM PDT 7/24/2014 by Justin Lowe FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS A well-matched ensemble rises to the challenge of launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style abundant thrills and no shortage of humor. TWITTER James Gunns assured foray into the Marvel universe stars Chris Pratt Zoe Saldana and Dave Bautista as a ragtag team of would-be galactic protectors. From the golden-typefaced title to the wisecracking dialogue and save-the-universe plotline Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy has been begging comparison to Star Wars from its initial marketing push (particularly the venerable Episode IV -- A New Hope). Unsurprisingly Guardians is no Star Wars but it turns out thats actually good news. Since Disney will be rebooting the classic franchise with Episode VII next year anyway James Gunns inventive space opera sourcing somewhat minor characters from the Marvel universe could serve as an appropriate warm-up -- or even launch a franchise of its own eventually. Guardians should see robust response in its opening days and stands to capitalize significantly overseas. After an efficient setup showing Peter Quills 1988 abduction from Earth by humanoid alien Yondu (Michael Rooker) leader of the space bandits known as Ravagers the plot skips forward 26 years to catch up with the adult Quill aka ""Star-Lord"" (Chris Pratt) now in service to his captors. Yondu has tasked Quill with stealing a mysterious silver orb hidden on an abandoned lifeless planet where hes forced to evade soldiers sent to retrieve the same sphere by Ronan (Lee Pace). A ruthless renegade from the Kree race Ronan is pursuing the artifact to transfer to his patron Thanos who in return has vowed to help him press an old vendetta against the planet Xandar. Ronan sends Thanos adopted daughter a highly accomplished green-skinned assassin named Gamora (Zoe Saldana) in pursuit of Quill who plans to sell the sphere for a profit. Once she catches up with him on Xandar shes brought up short by bounty hunter Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and his arboreal sidekick Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) who are seeking the reward Yondu has offered for Quills capture. Their tussle over the orb lands them all in prison which they only manage to escape thanks to fellow convict Drax (Dave Bautista) who joins their crew making a getaway aboard Quills spacecraft. The five reluctantly make a deal to split the sizeable fee from fencing the orb to a contact of Gamoras despite the risk of cutting out both Yondu and Ronan. Only after Gamora leads them to The Collector (Benicio Del Toro) do they discover the true purpose of the sphere and the threat it poses to the entire galaxy. The group will have to set aside their differences and unite behind Quill if they expect to save Xandar and themselves. Originally introduced into the Marvel universe in a 1969 comic book series as a 31st century team of misfit heroes Guardians of the Galaxy marks Marvel characters first foray into outer-space adventure. Its fair to note however that Guardians bears more than a passing resemblance to Star Wars not to mention Raiders of the Lost Ark and Joss Whedons outlaw sci-fier Serenity. In actuality Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlmans screenplay borrows so liberally and lightheartedly from the action-adventure and sci-fi canons that tracking these references becomes one of the films minor amusements. Overall the writers have crafted a well-articulated universe with distinct settings and relatable compelling characters devoted to a thrilling quest for redemption. Perhaps more significantly the generous use of situational and physical humor defuses any highbrow sci-fi pretensions that might discourage the genre-averse although excessive exposition occasionally hinders the action. Casting is key to the movies effectiveness and while Pratts resume may not immediately scream ""action hero"" he dons the mantle with obvious enthusiasm rounding off Quills rough edges with an endearing comedic sensibility. Meanwhile though Saldana doesnt clue us in on Gamoras inner motivations the actress -- who is no stranger to sci-fi after Avatar and Star Trek -- possesses all the action chops required to persuasively portray a deadly assassin and she makes for a resourceful heroine. Much of the movies scene-stealing is left to Rocket a CGI character impressively crafted by the Guardians crack VFX team and voiced with panache by Cooper. By contrast Vin Diesels Groot repeats only three words of dialogue relying on intonation for effect. In supporting roles Del Toro Djimon Hounsou as Ronans lieutenant and John C. Reilly and Glenn Close as Xandars homeland defense representatives all contribute admirably. Ultimately Gunns immersive interpretation of the Guardians universe succeeds in large part because of his integration of top-shelf visual effects. Superior execution by cinematographer Ben Davis production designer Charles Wood and the editorial team of Fred Raskin Craig Wood and Hughes Winborne dynamically underlines Gunns vision. Despite occasional disregard for the laws of physics much of the imagery displayed onscreen is so realistic and thrill-inducing that sometimes even the plot becomes almost secondary during the more intensely visual sequences. Music also plays a key role throughout the film with the likes of 10ccs ""Im Not in Love"" The Runaways ""Cherry Bomb"" and David Bowies ""Moonage Daydream"" deployed as frequently humorous counterpoints within tense action scenes. Examples of excess do surface intermittently with the overlong prison episode and the final battle sequence taking up disproportionate screen time. And credibility may waver a bit when this group of criminals and con artists commits rather too altruistically to saving the galaxy but semi-serious drama isnt Guardians strong suit anyway.

It also celebrates them. The genius commercial gamble of Marvels recent superhero movies is that even though the stories all take place in the same universe the studio has hired writer-directors with distinctive sensibilities to work within those constraints. Jon Favreaus penchant for crafting slick male anti-heroes helped give ""Iron Man"" its initial luster; super-fan Joss Whedon nimbly pulled together all the strands of earlier movies for ""The Avengers"" giving the superhero banter a credible human dimension in spite of its absurdities. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" -- which takes place in far-off star systems and mainly involves goofy aliens -- confronts these absurdities head-on which makes former Troma films disciple and B-movie junkie James Gunn the ideal choice for shepherding this project to fruition. He delivers well enough Though the special effects win the day ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" holds court with a sense of humor that transcends its more familiar ingredients. But make no mistake -- there are constraints to this type of mass market filmmaking and for all the entertaining asides that ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" offers up its hardly an adventurous piece of storytelling. As proven by the recent dust-up with Edgar Wrights script for ""Ant-Man"" which the studio allegedly rejected because Wright only makes movies on his terms theres always an element of compromise in play with movies made on this scale. To that end Gunn also fits the project. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" channels the expert awareness of genre traditions found in his earlier work while using the bigger scale to polish them. His two previous movies set the stage. The amusingly over-the-top alien invasion story ""Slither"" proved his ability to embrace both sides of the horror-comedy formula at once. With ""Super"" in which a deranged Rainn Wilson donned tights and made a series of misguided attempts to become a vigilante Gunn brought a mischievous sensibility to the superhero arena without actually critiquing it. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" consolidates those tendencies. At the same time it sublimates them into a bigger picture that dwarfs its better components. Fortunately the movie overcomes the limitations of its effects-driven narrative due to a series of well-honed performances. Chief among them is Chris Pratt as the storys sole Earthling Peter Quill whos kidnapped by rogue aliens as a child and grows up to be a roving interplanetary bandit. During one of his outings he comes across a powerful orb with the ability to destroy the universe. Mainly this McGuffin puts a series of plot devices into play Orphan assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is sent to track down Quill and get back the orb. Meanwhile the alien pirate Yondu (an enjoyably gruff Michael Rooker) puts a bounty on Quill leading to the introduction of the movies real stars both fully animated Cocky loudmouth bounty hunter Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his lumbering sidekick a walking tree named Groot (a digitized Vin Diesel who only says variations on the phrase ""I am Groot"" innumerable times over the course of his screen time). Eventually Quill winds up behind bars with the bounty hunters and they hesitantly join forces to break free joined by the hilarious literal-minded meathead Drax (Dave Bautista). The rest of the movie involves their efforts to evade the power-hungry radical Ronan (Lee Pace) from getting his hands on the orb and eventually the group transforms from self-interested hustlers to a duty-bound saviors. If thats a spoiler well what did you expect? But the journey to that obvious destination includes freewheeling exchanges and comical asides that wouldnt seem out of place in a Robert Altman movie. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is at its best when its about everything you dont expect it to be about the characters. Pratt who has proven himself a chameleonesque actor difficult to pin down makes perfect sense for this goal. He capably assumes the archetype of an action hero even while complicating his swagger with a klutzy maneuvers and a self-aware smirk. However Rocket and Groot hog the spotlight with such charisma that Marvel shouldnt rule out the prospects of a spin-off. Echoing a Han-and-Chewbacca-like chemistry the pairs smarmy reckless approach to getting the job done marks one of the best buddy comedy pairings in some time providing one more example of the rich possibilities afforded by the ability to craft CGI protagonists. Unfortunately Gunns script isnt as keen on the women. Saldana mainly plays it straight under layers of green makeup and when Pratt must rescue her from the clutches of deep space -- the 21st century equivalent of untying the damsel in distress from the train tracks -- she devolves into a bland support system for his duress. But when the script calls for her to deliver a good beating or hurl epithets at the crass men around her she delivers and thats enough to give the actress room to play around. And she certainly has plenty of space. Rocket and Groot arent the only hints of a ""Star Wars"" vibe on display. With every shot processed and textured to play up its otherworldly ingredients ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" takes place in a fully realized virtual world. When Benicio del Toro shows up for one prolonged scene as a scheming hoarder known as The Collector its just another excuse to showcase a roomful of cosmic things living and not that he has gathered from across the galaxy. As every shot impresses on us its an unfathomably giant universe out there. Given that scale the most exciting moments in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" dont involve its plot. When the pirate Yondu whistles to coax an arrow out of his belt and take down an entire army you get the sense that the scene could take place at any point in the movie. The entertainment value is splattered all over the place. But Gunn still manages to have fun with one overarching ordering device a mixtape made for Quill during his childhood by his mother before she died of cancer. The hero hauls this analog evidence of his past along with him through his digitized adventure as if grasping for the roots of a story that extends beyond its slick exteriors. As a result ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" benefits greatly from its pop-heavy soundtrack which includes The Five Stairsteps ""O-o-h Child"" being used to distract a villain and ""Cherry Bomb"" to enliven a montage as the team explains their plan to win the day. (Theres even an entire monologue involving a song from ""Footloose."") Gunn compliments this stylish device with sensational images of his stars including one slo-mo walk down the hallway that echoes the opening of ""American Hustle."" The device works With musical rhythms heightening the mood Gunn guides the superhero fantasy into rock star territory. In doing so Gunn efficiently turns his pop culture subject into a giddy playing field. Just like when ""Iron Man"" runs his mouth the heavy focus on style allows these silly narratives to gather as much of their value from an ebullient tone as they do from their costly production budgets. But its still the effects that dominate. When the ""Guardians"" engage in large scale combat particularly during the explosive (and explosively dull) giant spaceship-set battle in the final half hour the whole enterprise sags only regaining some ground when the banter returns. Yet the entire picture amounts to one grand special effect even as Gunn colors in the margins. Its best characters dont show even the slightest evidence of human flesh but their appeal has little to do with the technology that brings them to life. If ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" dropped its actual high stakes plot (that is saving the universe from imminent destruction) it would still amount to a pretty enjoyable movie. Its highlights which mainly involve the irascible Rocket prove as much Ever the troublemaker he repeatedly throws fake ingredients into his plans (like the need to steal a prisoners fake leg) just to mess with people. At one point he gets into a drunken brawl and threatens to blow an entire bar to shreds. Theres a genuine thrill to watching these raggedy moments -- rather than distracting you with effects they apply the effects to more satisfying exchanges and its here that the movie provides a window into a better kind of blockbuster. This summer has been especially potent with possibilities in that regard. While the latest ""Transformers"" provided the dullest option ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" offered a far more mature form of tentpole filmmaking. Luc Bessons ""Lucy"" opening this week flies off the rails with all kinds of inventive ideas even as it clumsily barrels ahead. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" falls somewhere in the middle of that spectrum. Its just dumb enough to please complaisant viewers but finds inspiration in a sarcastic attitude that transcends its factory-mandated conventions. By closing -- as all these movies must -- with the promise of further installments ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" keeps open the likelihood that even as the familiar story will continue it may continue to surprise us in other ways. One can only hope. Grade B ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" opens nationwide on August 1.

Taking place in the far-flung outer-space territories of the shared universe created in the Marvel Studios movies (""The Avengers"" ""Captain America The Winter Soldier"" et. al.) ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" takes a B-team of lesser-known comic-book heroes -- no familiar faces like Thor Wolverine or Iron Man here -- and thanks to director and co-writer James Gunn (""Slither"" ""Super"") wrings pulpy roguish space-opera fun from them. See video Bradley Coopers Rocket Raccoon Steals the Show in New Guardians of the Galaxy Trailer (Video) The film in fact owes as much to the space-faring fun of Joss Whedons ""Firefly"" and ""Serenity"" with its blue-collar approach to traveling the cosmos in search of profit than it does to the other Marvel movies and thats a good thing Unlike the stiff-jawed heroics of the other Marvel films this feels a little looser and lighter with Pratt as charming amoral accidental leader Peter Quill an earthling among the stars who as he will tell you is also known as the roving brigand ""Starlord."" The fact that Pratt has to keep reminding people of his code-name is of course part of the fun and theres a lot of fun to be had especially as the film brings its team of semi-heroes together. ""Guardians"" has a little more space for irony goofiness and sarcasm than the other Marvel movies which Gunn and co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman relish in exploring with great one-liners and running gags. Also read Guardians of the Galaxy for Dummies The 12 Comic Book Origins of Marvels Strangest Superheroes The film also has many of the structural flaws of the other Marvel movies -- no modern ""house style"" has become as much of a double edged sword. All the Marvel films look clean are shot relatively well and are to a one both overstuffed and underwritten full of too many characters in search of too many McGuffins. The complaint about this generation of 3-D blockbusters is that theyre like watching someone play a video game. The Marvel movies though are more like watching someone play chess you dont really get to know characters beyond their abilities in a fight and which side of the fairly black-and-white moral universe of these films they happen to occupy. Quills roving thieving and looting starts the film as he finds the cosmic whatsit that bad guy Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) an alien religious fanatic wants so he can rain down death on his peoples ancestral enemies; motivated by both possible profit and something like a dislike of mass murder Quill winds up assembling an ad hoc team in a space-prison to bust out and get the gadget before the bad guy. Also read Guardians of the Galaxy Tracking for 60 Million Opening Joining Quill are Gamora (Zoe Saldana slathered in green make-up) whos trying to escape her dad Thanos the Marvel villain last seen at the close of ""The Avengers."" Theres Drax (Dave Bautista made up in green and red) a hard-to-kill warrior with a sworn vendetta. Also along are Rocket a CGI creature voiced by Bradley Cooper changed by science and cruelty into a self-aware being that still looks remarkably like a raccoon and his pal Groot another CGI character a tree-being with durability toughness and Vin Diesels voice. Its the by-play between the characters that adds to the fun with Pratt as both the nut behind the wheel and the loose screw that somehow keeps it all together. ""Guardians"" doesnt feel like it borrows just from the ""Star Wars"" films but also from its followers and not-quite peers like ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" and ""Ice Pirates."" Much like the ""Transformers"" films this PG-13 movies language and violence put it in strangely adult territory even as its outlandish action plays out with goofy giddy fun; unlike that other franchise however this movie is actually something human beings might enjoy with action thats clear coherent driven by character and easy to appreciate. (In fact to put it bluntly the action in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is far far better than the stagey straight-on action shooting in ""The Avengers."") Also read Guardians of the Galaxy Cast Taking Over ABCs Jimmy Kimmel Live Before Premiere Technical matters are all top-notch with high marks to cinematographer Ben Davis (""Kick-Ass"" ""A Long Way Down"") and music supervisor Dave Jordan who put together an ace collection of 70s radio hits (including ""Im Not in Love"" ""Hooked on a Feeling"" ""Cherry Bomb"") as both a thematic touch and perfect propulsive material for action sequences. The 3-D is the best on-screen all summer lively and light and nicely used in action bits inspired as much by Chuck Jones as they are by George Lucas. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" will hardly stall or stop concerns that Marvels riding a soon-to-pop bubble that cant last forever but it still has enough scrappy heart and smart humor to make it seem like the best possible kind of product one where the talent of all involved makes it easy to enjoy their hustle.

If the wayward denizens of ""Star Wars"" Mos Eisley Cantina rose up and demanded their own starring vehicle it would probably look something like ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" an alt-""Avengers"" in which a ragtag band of misfits and mercenaries make the world a safer place almost by accident. An unusually prankish and playful Marvel Studios vehicle director James Gunns presumptive franchise-starter is overlong overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant -- as does Chris Pratts winning performance as the most blissfully spaced-out space crusader this side of Buckaroo Banzai. While these ""Guardians"" seem unlikely to challenge the box office benchmarks set by their Marvel brethren this inaugural outing should nevertheless inject some much-needed life into Hollywoods sagging summer fortunes. Introduced in the January 1969 issue of ""Marvel Super-Heroes"" the Guardians have been spun off recast and rebooted several times over the decades though largely in keeping with creators Arnold Drake and Gene Colans vision of an intergalactic (and interspecies) Dirty Dozen traveling through time and space to protect the universe from various unfriendlies. For the film Gunn and co-writer Nicole Perlman have taken most of their inspiration from the 2008 incarnation of the series created by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning which offered a new Guardians team consisting of various supporting players from the Marvel annals all under the questionable leadership of one Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord) a half-human half-alien space jockey with a comically square jaw and an air of preening self-regard. But perhaps because the ""Guardians"" source material isnt as sacrosanct as the likes of ""Captain America"" or ""Thor"" the filmmakers seem to have been given more than the usual license to play and reinvent. Theyve tossed out a few regular characters (including the messianic ""cosmic being"" Adam Warlock) reduced others to insider cameos (look fast for Cosmo the telepathic Russian space dog) and made haste with the comics pesky space-time fissures in favor of a more streamlined accessible storyline. Above all theyve turned Quill (Pratt) into an amiable good-vibing doofus who seems congenitally incapable of taking anything seriously but can when the occasion demands kick serious butt. When we first see Quill he seems more garbage man than guardian a galactic scavenger working in the employ of blue-skinned Yondu (Michael Rooker) his adoptive father (and in Marvel lore one of the original 60s-era Guardians). In a scene lovingly modeled on the opening sequence from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" Quill enters a cave on an abandoned planet to retrieve a mysteriously powerful silver orb and instead of a rousing John Williams fanfare the soundtrack erupts with Native American rockers Redbone singing ""Come and Get Your Love."" Its the first of many 70s FM classics (Blue Swede Elvin Bishop Ashford and Simpson) that emanate from the mix tape inside Quills trusty Walkman and which give ""Guardians"" a funky off-kilter energy even when the plotting turns toward the conventional. (Where else have you ever seen a prison break scored to ""The Pina Colada Song""?) If the Avengers are Marvels top-of-the-class all-stars the Guardians are its underachieving freaks and geeks and Gunn and Perlman have essentially crafted a new origin story about how these riff-raffers come together to keep said orb (a variant on ""The Avengers"" hot-potato Tesseract) out of the hands of Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) a warmongering baddie hellbent on destroying the Earth-like planet Xandar. Fighting the good fight alongside Quill are Gamora (sci-fi ""it"" girl Zoe Saldana) rebellious daughter of an even bigger baddie called Thanos; the hulking elaborately tattooed Drax (ex-WWE wrestling champ Dave Bautista) who holds Ronan responsible for the death of his family; a genetically modified humanoid raccoon named Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper); and his resident muscle an anthropomorphic tree called Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). Its difficult to imagine Gunn being asked to do anything like a straight comicbook movie on the basis of his previous ""Super"" (2010) a darkly funny brutally violent portrait of superheroism as a kind of psychopathy. With its large budget and crowd-pleasing ambitions ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" cant venture nearly as far out on a limb but to Gunns credit hes delivered a movie thats idiosyncratic enough to stand out from the crowd without ever crossing over into the full-tilt dadaism of a ""Buckaroo Banzai."" The adventures here comprise a fairly standard set of Saturday-serial cliffhangers and hairsbreadth escapes and Gunn puts them across with a B-movie savoir faire that keeps ""Guardians"" from ever getting too high on the hog or too bogged down in its own mythmaking. Even when we arrive at the requisite CG-enhanced scenes of competing entities zipping and zapping each other with waves of electromagnetic energy the movie retains a welcome lightness of touch as if to say ""Yes the fate of the universe hangs in the balance but what else is new?"" For all that Gunn and Perlman have pared away ""Guardians"" still has more characters and incidents than it quite knows what to do with some of which seem planted here as seeds for the inevitable sequel. Benicio Del Toro pops up briefly as an exotic ""collector"" who looks like Liberace after a bleaching accident while Glenn Close is around just long enough as a senior Xandar peacekeeper to make you wonder how many man-hours went into crafting her elaborate hair bun. ""Doctor Who"" co-star Karen Gillan is so hastily introduced as another daughter of Thanos that when she eventually comes into possession of the orb it takes a moment to remember who she even is. But the core characters are lovingly fleshed out by the performers especially Pratt who seems to be grooving to his own private soundtrack even when he doesnt have his headphones in his ears and Cooper and Diesel who nearly walk off with the movie as a couple of fractious yet inseparable platonic soulmates firmly in the R2D2/C3PO mold. (It helps that their computer-animated avatars are both marvelously detailed and seamlessly integrated into the live-action scenes.) Cooper is so good at finding the pathos in his existentially conflicted critter that you half expect the little guy to plead ""I am not an animal"" Except of course he is. Elsewhere the movie sports a rich varied look courtesy of cinematographer Ben Davis (""Kick-Ass"") and production designer Charles Wood from the rusty tiered interior of the floating prison known as the Kyln to the anodyne pastels of Xandar which suggests a cross between Oz and Century City. Special effects makeup designer David White does a superb job of creating distinctive looks for the movies expansive gallery of humanoid and alien species.

I havent seen a movie this nostalgic of the Reagan era and values in a loooong time. Reply Stephen33 says August 10 2014 at 728 pm So looking back at all the comments below and the reviewerss opinion as well as the box office numbers.. ""director James Gunns presumptive franchise-starter is overlong overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please"" [over long? its exactly 2 hours] [overstuffed? its bare bones compared to how most 1sts comic to movie series focus on back story yet pulls it off brilliantly ] [ too eager to please? I guess you mean it actually pleases]. Numbers so far 320 M worldwide with no Asian or Middle Eastern markets open yet [which should slam in another 20 to 50 M]; at its second weekend (= already surpassing the budget or ""paid for itself"" mark of 175 M budget). As far as peoples concern of sticking to the source material it does that in spades aside from a few artistic freedoms. The characters are spot on and maybe even more cohesive than the comics and the universe is more or less right (give or take for the exactness of the timeline). Reply Gill-7 says August 17 2014 at 653 am Stephen33 I couldnt have said it any better myself Exactly what I was thinking after reading this review Reply maximehokayemMaxime says August 5 2014 at 443 pm Little did you know. Box Office utterly smashed Reply Nick says July 30 2014 at 631 am One of most oft stated lines by you critics ""too long."" Youve forgot the movie going experience. For you its a job. Our group of 6 see a couple dozen movies each year. FYI we rarely see anything under 110 minutes. Our view? We want to get away for a couple hours. My work day ( like you) cant be over quick enough. Reply Garra Cornish says July 27 2014 at 1223 pm Excellent review of a film which despite being based on material not widely known in common pop culture likely has the chops to propel this story into Titanic levels of interest. I think Variety is fortunate to have Foundas writing such well balanced descriptive and accurate reviews (at least IMO). There hasnt been a lot to interest me this summer Winter Soldier a few - very few - others and with Jupiter being pushed to 2015 its up to Guardians to carry the torch for the rest of 2014 or at least until December/HObbit rolls around. Reply Jacques Strappe says July 25 2014 at 1022 am So far at 21 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes Guardians is 100% Fresh. Looks like ching ching for the Marvel/Disney cash registers both domestically and foreign. Reply nerdrage says July 25 2014 at 1109 am Yep the signs have been there for a big blockbuster success all summer long. Reply rocky-o says July 25 2014 at 347 am sounds like they took bits of firefly the ice pirates and quark-the old tv show with richard benjamin and just hodgepodged them together...could be fun but barely original... Reply Todd Jordan says July 25 2014 at 1219 pm Because originality is the only measuring stick of quality I suppose. Clamber down from your high horse before you get nosebleed you pretentious twaddle. Reply nerdrage says July 25 2014 at 1055 am I remember reading the Guardians comics as a kid in the 70s (though they might have been the original crew not these guys) so sorry this is no ""copy"" of Firefly unless Joss Whedon has a time travel machine in his garage. Really its an iteration of the durable Buck Rogers story thats closing in on a century old which was also used for Farscape. The characters map almost exactly between GotG and Farscape. But whatever Im just so jazzed to see this movie A week to go Reply briantoohey says July 25 2014 at 703 am Or you know... they just produced an adaptation of their comic that predates all of those. Reply Gabriel Augusto Vidigal says July 24 2014 at 1020 pm I really hope that this will be great and fullfill all my expectations. Reply rjbailey says July 24 2014 at 648 pm Reblogged this on Locating Frankensteins Brain. Reply Belell Kaeh says July 24 2014 at 429 pm yes once again piss on the source material. Hollywood thinks the foundation these movies are built on the comic fans dont seem to care when they hike a leg all over the material we love. but truth is we maybe be excited that were seeing SOME kind of version of the stories we love it doesnt change the fact that were still pissed that they seem to think the writers and artist of the material we love were morons who didnt know what they were doing and need helping ""getting it right"". Reply nerdrage says July 25 2014 at 1108 am I read the comics as a kid. This movie sounds right in line with what I remember. Its all just a variation on the Buck Rogers idea. Human fish-out-of-water character has colorful crazy adventures in space. You know what if they cast Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange THEN we can break out the pitchforks and torches but GotG looks like a case where the Hollywood schlockmeisters got things right. Lets enjoy it. Im sure theyll disappoint us next time. Reply ChiefMal says July 25 2014 at 604 am April 2014 sales for Marvels Guardians of the Galaxy were 22705 units meaning it wasnt even in the top 100 for the month. So you expect a movie studio to tailor a summer blockbuster movie to an audience of 22705 people? If everyone who purchased the comic in April went to see the movie on opening weekend in IMAX 3D then it would be add 340575.00 to the box office. Yeah catering to those 22K fans of the comic book instead of a general movie audience seems like a recipe for financial success. Reply cadavra says July 24 2014 at 947 pm The fact that you needed to point out that one of the writers is a woman (the implication being that shes genetically unfit to write a comic book movie) speaks volumes more about you than it does about the film. Reply Jared Ouimette of Midland TX says July 24 2014 at 649 pm Yousa dumb biotch. Reply Todd says July 24 2014 at 611 pm so what is your favorite guardian story line from the comics then? and what did they change that pissed all over it? Reply Lon Levin says July 25 2014 at 332 pm After reading Varietys review Im disappointed that Adam Warlock / Magus arent in the film you cant have Thanos and infinity gems without Warlock but Im sure hell be in the next one. Still I cant wait to see GOTG after watching the 17 minute preview. boo says July 24 2014 at 233 pm boo Reply robbie says July 24 2014 at 211 pm Im obviously partial before I say it...there are unique people that cant be replaced because of their individuality yet it takes a village also while Robert Downey Jr. brings in billions not forgetting his incredible marketing around the world Tom Cruise is one also. Like ability. The glut of superhero films makes one wonder how fast Marvel is running its self to exhaustion. Reply jms says July 24 2014 at 230 pm Was that supposed to be coherent? Reply nerdrage says July 25 2014 at 1112 am Sounds like something for Marvel shareholders to worry about. Ill enjoy their movies until they start ""running to exhaustion"" and then Ill go watch something I like better instead. But that wont happen for a while. GotG and related stories could form a franchise within a franchise. Wheres Warlock? Wheres Nova? How about those Inhumans? paulwt3 says July 24 2014 at 159 pm Marvels sure arent dying critically or at the box office. Reply Oscar says July 24 2014 at 154 pm Gamora isnt Ronans adopted daughter. She was adopted by Thanos who Ronan worked for. Reply LOL says July 24 2014 at 114 pm Superhero movies are dying though http//movies-on-my-mind.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/superhero-movies-are-outstaying-their.html Reply Phil W says July 24 2014 at 411 pm Wrong.... Superhero films are doing big at the box office. Each sequel is making more than the previous film. Thats a fact Reply David says July 24 2014 at 239 pm Lol some random blogger whose air of pretentiousness is so apparent I couldnt even finish reading their article does not a prediction of the future of cinema make.
