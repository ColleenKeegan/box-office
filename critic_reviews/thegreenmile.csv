Comments (1) The Green Mile In this epic drama which suffuses dark themes with humor and a grand spiritual agenda the head guard at a southern prison in 1935 comes to doubt the guilt of a convicted child murderer newly arrived on death row. Much of the three-hour movie takes place in the prison but the resonant characterization expansive plotting and judicious use of exterior locations and flashbacks turn the walls into windows. Director Frank Darabont (The Shawshank Redemption) adapted a serial novel by Stephen King; with Michael Clarke Duncan and Tom Hanks. 188 min.

In The Shawshank Redemption he managed to invest this anxious leisure with tension and transcendence. Odd how a style that looked spare in one movie can feel bloated in the next.

B The Green Mile Genre Horror Drama; Starring Michael Clarke Duncan Tom Hanks Sam Rockwell; Director Frank Darabont; Author Stephen King; Runtime (in minutes) 188; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted December 10 1999 -- 1200 AM EST With two major motion pictures to his name writer-director Frank Darabont has set up shop as the go-to guy for overlong lyrical movies made from strenuously uplifting Stephen King stories set in prisons. Five years after The Shawshank Redemption the filmmaker returns to the idealistic notion of incarceration as an opportunity for redemption in The Green Mile. And the passage of time has only intensified his fondness for dawdling. I complain--this is nothing more epic than good old King rewarding the kids who play nice and punishing the bullies and a three-hour unspooling seems willful--but only mildly; The Green Mile is a long stretch but a scenic one. The authors 1996 novel about 1930s death-row prisoners and their guards originally published in serial form has a lot to say about the good and evil of which men are capable. Theres no point in introducing a character as extraordinary as John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) a massive childlike black man convicted of the rape and murder of twin girls who performs marvels of healing and resurrection (his initials arent subtle) without letting the effects of Coffeys singular saintliness build to a suitable climax. Baleful bluntly shocking depictions of death by electric chair demand time to do the punishment full horrible justice. A comic-relief mouse named Mr. Jingles requires his own spotlight (and musical theme). Besides Tom Hanks needs room not only to amass the components of another superior mainstream performance but also to rally another impressive roster of strong individual performers into a sturdy platoon. Hanks at this point Americas one-man decency squad plays Paul Edgecomb superintendent on E Block at Louisianas Cold Mountain Penitentiary where the lime-colored floor gives the quarters its name. The Green Mile opens with scenes of a cloudy-eyed old man--old Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer)--looking wistful and for a brief mad moment I thought What is this Saving Private Ryan II? But then the story flashes back to 1935 (three years later than in the book for reasons of film history that become clear in the last reel). And the old guy fortunately vanishes replaced by a younger Edgecomb who runs his ward with the assistance of a tight team the faithful second in command (David Morse) the kid (Private Ryans Barry Pepper) the veteran (Jeffrey DeMunn) and the mean cowardly excellently named sadist Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison in a breakout performance) who happens to be the governors nephew. Psychopathic Wetmore likes to taunt and abuse the prisoners (including Michael Jeter as the flittery Creole so fond of Mr. Jingles) but Edgecomb treats them respectfully. Hes particularly kind to Coffey who performs his first holy act by way of thanks The condemned man rids his jailer of an excruciating urinary tract infection by squeezing the trouble out with his gigantic hands then releasing the affliction through his mouth where it disperses into the air as a shower of tiny sooty insects. And thats just the start of JCs miracle working. In its own old-fashioned way Darabonts style of picture making is well matched to King-size yarn spinning. The director isnt afraid to let big emotions and grand gestures linger much like the buzzing mystery dust puffing out of Coffeys mouth. Capable of modulating the pitch in domestic scenes between Edgecomb and his supportive wife (wonderful Bonnie Hunt a pip when it comes to playing real) and in a seamless exchange between Edgecomb and Coffeys former lawyer (Hanks old Forrest Gump buddy Gary Sinise) Darabont can also match the author shock for shock when it comes to horror In a sickeningly effective scene he stages an electrocution that goes nightmarishly wrong literally frying the skin off a man. (""His eyes now nothing but misshapen globs of white filmy jelly had been blown out of their sockets and lay on his cheeks. His eyelashes were gone and as I looked the lids themselves caught fire and began to burn"" writes King; thats a lot to live up to.) The director lays it on--but then so does the illustrious author. Which is why Im willing to ignore my Indiglo watch. Three hours for the forces of good to triumph over the powers of evil plus assorted graphic violence special-effects miracles Tom Hanks and a mouse? Excessive but I like Mr. Jingles cant resist the Christmas-season cheese.

Quite involving at its best and needlessly attenuated and self-consciously ""inspiring"" at its worst pic has all the earmarks of a year-end prestige release beginning with Tom Hanks at the top of a fine cast. Positioning himself as the unassailable specialist in adapting Stephen King period prison novels for the screen Frank Darabont emerges from his five-year hiatus after ""The Shawshank Redemption"" with ""The Green Mile"" an intermittently powerful and meticulously crafted drama that falls short of its full potential due to considerable over-length and some shopworn simplistic notions at its center. Quite involving at its best and needlessly attenuated and self-consciously ""inspiring"" at its worst this Castle Rock presentation from Warner Bros. has all the earmarks of a year-end prestige release beginning with Tom Hanks at the top of a fine cast. But death row setting protracted running time and likely divided reviews make this far from a sure thing commercially; it should start strong upon Dec. 10 release with long-term viability depending upon the tenor of critical response and awards nominations. Working from Kings 1996 bestseller that was published in six serialized paperback installments Darabont is nothing if not a fastidious storyteller dedicated to fulsome character detailing and sturdy structural carpentry. In this new film as in ""Shawshank"" the writer-director proves very adept at lighting numerous long fuses that burn slowly through the yarns lengthy telling and finally pay off in some big moments some more satisfying than others. Its a tribute to Darabonts skill that he is able to sustain interest in these strands over such a long haul; its a reflection of his self-indulgence that he should think that this material warrants such doting elaboration. Told as an epic flashback by a very elderly man who relates his long-secret story to a lady friend at a nursing home tale is largely set within the modest confines of E block or death row at Cold Mountain Penitentiary in Louisiana in 1935. Title refers to the shade of the faded linoleum on the floor of the facility a well-kept bright brick building that resembles a small warehouse. Presiding over the handful of inmates is head guard Paul Edgecomb (Hanks) a decent middle-aged man dedicated to maintaining as much calm and dignity as possible given the dire circumstances of his prisoners. On his staff are his loyal second-in-command Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse); sensitive greenhorn Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper); old pro Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn); and the groups wild card Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) a shrimpy sadist who can get away with all manner of horrible behavior since hes the son of the governors wife. Behind bars at the outset are good-hearted Creole Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and repentant Native American murderer Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham Greene) whos about to walk the mile to the electric chair. Shortly joining them and barely able to fit into his cell is John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) a towering heavily muscled black man whos been convicted of killing two little girls. Belying Coffeys menacing look however is his demeanor which is unvaryingly sweet-natured polite and openly vulnerable; the greatest concern of this illiterate childlike giant is that some lights be left on at night since hes afraid of the dark. Typical of Darabonts deliberate approach is the detail with which he presents the rehearsal for the Indians execution. A morbidly tense and riveting sequence reveals a startlingly makeshift-looking electric chair and what it takes to successfully put a prisoner to death. With a cooperative prisoner (an amusing Harry Dean Stanton) serving as a stand-in Edgecomb proceeds for the ostensible benefit of newcomer Percy through every step of the process the head-shaving the strapping in the application of a wet sponge to the mans head to improve conductivity the donning of a hood and headcap the charge-up of electricity the last words and the final throwing of the switch. Once Bitterbuck is gone another prisoner takes his place on death row ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell) a three-time killer and swamp rat who can only be restrained by periodic stints in a straitjacket and a padded cell. So between the opposite poles of good and evil repped by the saintly simpleton Coffey on the one hand and the maniacal Wharton and Percy on the other Darabont begins heavily developing thoughts about the extremes of which human beings are capable as represented by their ability to give life and take it away. The first sign that something miraculous is in the offing comes when Coffey threateningly pulls Edgecomb up against his cells bars and grabs his crotch; after a very weird moment Coffey releases the guard and lets loose from his mouth a flow of flying particles that quickly evaporate. Immediately a bladder infection that has caused Edgecomb horrendous pain clears up which in turn improves his intimate life with his plain-speaking wife (Bonnie Hunt). More astounding still is Coffeys restoration of life to Delacroixs pet mouse that has been stomped to death by Percy. Circumstantial evidence to the contrary how could such a man have killed two innocent girls wonders Edgecomb who has seen more than his share of guilty men in his lifetime. In between endless taunts from Wharton and the films most gruesome sequence in which Percy deliberately botches Delacroixs execution so that he literally fries to death in prolonged agony Edgecomb becomes convinced not only of Coffeys innocence but of his other-worldly healing powers leading him to hatch an audacious plot to have the inmate try secretly to cure the advanced cancer consuming the beloved wife (Patricia Clarkson) of the prisons dignified warden (James Cromwell). As the date of Coffeys inevitable execution approaches the storys religious flavor and connotations build to a crescendo of intensity; the thematic elements of miracles guilt forgiveness and duty are dealt with even-handedly but also conveniently so as to smooth over the materials troubling issues with reassuring and hopeful salves. While ""The Green Mile"" often grabs and generally holds ones attention through the long journey there are any number of sequences that could have been tightened or eliminated in the interests of storytelling dispatch. Darabonts technique readily sustains the thoroughness with which he develops scenes but his points would still be clear enough without the epic treatment. And while Hutchison and Rockwell create deliciously hateable figures of pure evil and Duncan elicits appropriately massive sympathy with his pivotal performance as the agent of goodness these characters never grow multi-dimensionally and are ultimately more symbolic than credibly real. All the same the ensemble acting is of a high order. Hanks excels as the prison guard who is well balanced enough to nearly always handle his many troubles in proper imaginative fashion. Along with Duncan all the other actors playing doomed inmates get their big moments to shine with Jeter blending courage with emotional fragility as Delacroix. Percy aside the prison officials are all portrayed as fundamentally upstanding. Gary Sinise is commanding in his one scene as an attorney who gives his views on Coffey to Edgecomb. Despite the relatively cramped quarters of E block pic isnt bothersomely confined or claustrophobic and looks terrific thanks to Terence Marshs outstanding production design Karyn Wagners costumes and David Tattersalls lensing. Within individual scenes Richard Francis-Bruces editing is impeccably precise in obtaining maximum values while Thomas Newmans generally strong score occasionally slips over into over-stressed grandeur.

Russell (""Three Kings"") whose slam-edits pounding soundtracks and fractured narratives are shaking up the way stories are told directed and edited. But in the midst of all the pontificating over these new boy geniuses sweeping declarations announcing ""The Death of the Narrative"" and ""The New Age of Cinema"" most of the films in the front-running for the best picture Academy Award for the year 2000 are returns to good old-fashioned Hollywood story-telling. Director/writer Frank Darabonts film ""The Green Mile"" is one of them. VIDEO Theatrical preview for ""The Green Mile"" Real 28K 80K Windows Media 28K 80K At the helm of a remarkable group of perfectly cast actors is Tom Hanks making his bid for Oscar No. 3 in the role of Paul Edgecomb. In 1935 as the Great Depression is at its bleakest Edgecomb is the head guard on death row at a southern prison called Cold Mountain Penitentiary. The cell block is called ""the green mile"" because of the color of the floor leading from the cells to the electric chair. The film begins and ends in present day with Hanks character as an old man (played by Dabbs Greer). Through flashback the older Edgecomb leads us into his remembrance of a mystical encounter on that green-hued stretch of linoleum with a gentle giant named John Coffey a man awaiting execution in that distant time and place. Duncan plays larger-than-life role Michael Clarke Duncan in his first major film role (hes had small parts before including a role in the 1998 blockbuster ""Armageddon"" starring Bruce Willis) plays the doomed Coffey. Hes been found guilty of the brutal murders of two 9-year-old sisters and sentenced to die in the electric chair. Duncan does an incredible job of going from a hulking menace with a seemingly damaged mind to a near state-of-grace by the end of the film. CHAT Want to talk to ""Green Mile"" star Michael Clarke Duncan? Mark your calendar for his ""Meet the Oscar Hopefuls"" chat at 7 p.m. ET on December 15. MESSAGE BOARD Do you see Oscar potential in ""The Green Mile""? Post a message His entrance into the story is carefully orchestrated by Darabont. While Duncan stands 65"" and weighs 320 pounds his character is an even more imposing 7 feet tall and 350 pounds so Darabont rarely puts Duncan in a full-body two-shot with his fellow actors. Instead we see Coffey in bits and pieces from extremely low angles. It works. Duncan as Coffey comes across as huge We also meet Coffeys fellow inmates waiting for their dates with death. They include a wily Cajun named Eduard ""Del"" Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and a repentant Native-American named Arlen Bitterbuck (Graham Greene nominated for best supporting actor for 1990s ""Dances With Wolves""). Both men have come to terms with their fates and both appear ready to pay their debts to society. In the weeks leading up to Coffeys date with death we slowly become familiar with the odd routine on death row. Delacroix adopts a mouse who has wandered into the prison and names him Mr. Jingles. This act humanizes the convicted killer and by their reactions to his deed does the same for most of the men around him. Edgecombs fellow guards include gruff but gentle enforcer ""Brutal"" Brutus Howell played expertly by David Morse. Harry Terwilliger a veteran guard whos seen it all is portrayed by Jeffrey DeMunn. And Barry Pepper who appeared with Hanks in ""Saving Private Ryan"" plays a sensitive young guard named Dean Stanton. Rocking the boat Coffeys story slowly reveals itself and as the tale unfolds -- and various ""miracles"" begin to happen -- it becomes increasingly impossible to believe in his guilt. Edgecomb and his men begin to question how a man with such great gifts for healing the sick can also be a cold-blooded killer. Then dramatic tension builds as this delicate balance between the ""dead men walking"" and their keepers is violently broken by two men one a prisoner one a guard. The prisoner is the vicious William Wharton whos given the nickname ""Wild Bill"" because of his love of killing sprees. Hes played with evil glee and great authority by Sam Rockwell. The guard who rocks the quiet world of death row is a sleazy man named Percy Wetmore. His aunt is married to the states governor which gives him both political clout and job security. But hes a despicable worm who gets a sadistic kick out of taunting the prisoners. Carrying this role is Doug Hutchison who specializes in portraying people we love to hate -- past roles include a redneck rapist in ""A Time To Kill"" and a liver-eating mutant on ""The X-Files.""

Starring Tom Hanks David Morse Michael Clarke Duncan James Cromwell Michael Jeter Sam Rockwell and Bonnie Hunt. Directed and written by Frank Darabont. (R. 182 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Frank Darabont is such a committed filmmaker and believes so earnestly and intensely in the stories he puts onscreen that it seems unsporting to point out that hokum is his middle name. In ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) a prison yarn taken from a Stephen King story he explored the indomitability of the human spirit. In his second feature ""The Green Mile"" which opens today he tells another prison story also based on a Stephen King work that advocates the possibility of miracles in everyday lives. The setting this time is a South ern prison in 1935. Were on death row where Paul Edgecomb a kind and decent man played predictably by Tom Hanks is the head guard. (The story is told in flashback as Hanks character played by Dabbs Greer recalls it for a nursing-home friend.) Year after year Paul and his fellow guards see condemned men come and die -- some innocent some guilty some repentant some insane. Theyve never seen anything like John Coffey a 7-foot massively built black man who allegedly killed two young girls. The guards are daunted at first and then suspicious How could a cold-blooded killer be so naive and childlike and afraid of the dark? Soon enough they learn that Coffey played by Michael Clarke Duncan is a man who works miracles with healing hands. Theres a mythological aspect to this gentle giant -- like Paul Bunyan or John Henry -- and Darabont goes to elaborate lengths to dramatize his supernatural powers. He also gives him a halo (humble makes pure) and then contrasts Coffeys amazing goodness with a sadistic guard named Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchinson) and a crazed racist played by Sam Rockwell. Toss in a wacky Cajun (Michael Jeter) a remorseful American Indian (Graham Greene) and an endearing trained mouse named Jingles and youve got three hours of overstatement and schmaltz. Make that three hours two minutes. Darabont doesnt know when hes said enough doesnt know when hes depicted one too many miracles doesnt know when his actors have popped enough veins or when a horrific electric-chair execution has gone on so long that it makes one want to turn away or leave the theater. He butters the butter layers honey over the sugar. Some people like this kind of oversize dazzle-and- flash filmmaking and for those who do Darabont is the perfect practitioner. Thats because he believes in it completely and passionately. Theres not a trace of cynicism in ""The Green Mile"" which takes its name from the length of green linoleum that leads to ""Sparky"" the electric chair. Instead theres a naivete that turns offensive Why for example is a strong and powerful black man considered palatable only when hes got the brain of a 3- year-old? ""Forrest Gump"" had the same problem with the mush-headed Bubba character. In this case John Coffey speaks in deze-and-dem cli ches (""I needs to see you boss"") sweats profusely when he works his miracles and has the humble innocuous manner of a plantation field hand in a moldy melodrama. Equally overstated is Wetmore the brutal but cowardly guard who got his job only because his uncle is the governor. His greatest wish is to see a man up close as he ""cooks"" on the chair but in fact hes such a wuss that he wets himself -- hey check out his name -- when a prisoner grabs him by the throat. The acting by Hanks and David Morse (as his assistant) and Jeter Jeffrey DeMunn and James Cromwell in supporting roles is fine. David Tattersalls photography is handsome Thomas Newmans music is florid and melodramatic and ""The Green Mile"" despite good intentions is inflated self-important and often absurd. ..
