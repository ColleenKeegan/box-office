Much like Foxs Ice Age films actually and this new film similarly has fun juxtaposing prehistoric reality with modern gags. Along the way it also presents a skin-deep meditation on the age-old conflict between brute force and brainpower and between terrified ignorance and rational thought. Lest you mistake any of it for social satire however the opening set piece gives us an extended game of caveman rugby involving the family stealing and playing keep-away with a giant egg while a variety of fantastical prehistoric creatures tries to take it from them -- or as they call it ""breakfast."" The Croods it turns out arent exactly at the top of this particular food chain. Nor are they any great shakes in the brain department either as Eep their rebellious daughter (voiced by Emma Stone) informs us in voice-over. This is a family that hunkers down in a dark cave at night and listens to dad Grug (Nicolas Cage) tell them the same story over and over again about a girl who got curious and went out exploring one night ""She saw something new ... and DIED"" is how the story ends every time. One day however Eep meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a young enterprising dreamer with delicate features who looks down on cavemen and shies away from brute force and ignorance. Challenging Grugs status as alpha male Guy wows the family with fire and a variety of other newfangled creations footwear among them. He also informs them that ""the world is ending"" -- that is to say earthquakes are peeling away the ground right beneath their feet and lava is slowly consuming everything. Guy wants to head to higher ground -- specifically two very tall Mormon temple-like mountains in the distance. Grug is reluctant as this requires abandoning the terrifying comfort of their cave for the terrifying uncertainty of distant lands -- quite a task for a family that instantly gathers into a kill circle at the first sign of trouble. The Croods isnt particularly smart but it has just enough wit to keep us engaged and just enough speed to keep us from feeling restless. (Along with that opening rugbylike extravaganza theres also an elaborate climactic set piece involving a giant animal skeleton a swarm of meat-eating piranha birds and the worlds most adorable saber-toothed tiger.) Some of the visual gags are cute At one point a mishap in a field of giant corn leads to the worlds first fireworks display not to mention a mountain of oversize popcorn. But theres a surprisingly borscht belt tinge to much of the humor as well One of the main reasons Grug finally agrees to their long trip into the unknown is because grandma (Cloris Leachman) says shell die if she has to leave and the one-liners are oddly old-fashioned. (""I was in love. He was a hunter; I was a gatherer. We were quite the scandal."") These are easy-pickings humor-wise and to its credit The Croods picks them clean. The vocal talent is well cast too Cage in particular turns out to be quite perfect as the bewildered adorably brutish Grug. But for a movie thats all about using ones mind The Croods doesnt exactly try too hard to impress us with its own brainpower. This is after all also a movie in which someone invents the hug. A This review initially implied that Fox released the film instead of Dreamworks.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Rated PG. 91 minutes. At area theaters The following observation comes with apologies to the Geico Caveman Full of code-enabled visual artistry and infused with story-telling wisdom ""The Croods"" is epochs ahead of its fear-driven cave-dad Grug. And yet the family that leaves their cave out of necessity and embarks on a journey in DreamWorks latest animated feature turns out to be a touching poster clan for the joys and pangs risks and rewards of evolving. Co-directors and co-writers Kirk DeMicco and Arvada native Chris Sanders have avoided the obvious while delivering the delightful. The terrain Grug (Nicolas Cage) and family traverse is utterly new and comes with fresh dangers. Yet if there is a villain its name is ""Fear."" The hero? Curiosity. Emma Stone gives voice to the movies central protagonist Eap the teenager whos starting to bristle at her fathers rules. Eap has a hankering to go toward the light. And that doesnt mean demise but quite likely its opposite. When she meets a guy named Guy she begins to see the possibilities. The first most telling one being that there is another (albeit more advanced) human walking around. Voiced by Ryan Reynolds Guy is inventive -- and alone. He has a pet sloth named Belt and a looming sense that the world is coming to an end. He too is headed toward the light. Guy becomes a guide to the possible. Too bad that Grugs favorite words are ""No no no and no."" His go-to mantra ""Fear is good. Change is bad."" Truth is Grugs extreme caution and out-sized strength have served his family well. They are the only cave family still standing. The movie kicks off with a furious and coordinated chase for breakfast with Grug wife Ugga (Catherine Keener) mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman) and kids Eap Thunk and the ferocious toddler Sandy in a mad wild dash for the days sustenance. The family that preys together well survives. Of course they are not alone in this amazing race. Nor are they solely predators. Populated with strange and imaginative beasts ""The Croods"" rebuffs typical ideas about the animals that roamed eons ago. At least one resembles a Maurice Sendak creature. Where the wild things are indeed. A flock of seemingly demure pink birds takes wing to become a mesmerizing swarm swooping and wheeling in spellbinding unison. In this world being spellbound is not always a good thing. ""The Croods"" comes with some ""Avatar"" moments of 3-D oohs and awe. Yet the movie never feels derivative. It captures the wonder (and more gently the anxiety) of discovery time and time again. And the filmmakers have a hoot playing with the Croods encounters with as well as their misunderstandings of all things new. The writing is swift clever. Yet DeMicco and Sanders never overstate their jokes. The story unfolds in a nearly wink-free realm. OK there is a running gag about mothers-in-law. The routine is familiar up to a point. When it tips over what a pleasure. Eaps narration bookends the action. But this heros journey doesnt belong to one character. This is the saga of advancing as humans. When the ground shakes and the lava flows in new fissures and canyons curiosity and problem solving trump fear; heart matters more than brawn. And even art and play have their role in survival.

Instead theyve called it The Croods and centered it on a cavegirl named Eep (Emma Stone) who has a dad she sees -- entirely accurately lets note -- as a knuckle-dragging Neanderthal. Voiced by Nicolas Cage dad is loving but dim and as youll guess from his bedtime stories -- all of which involve characters who die when they encounter anything new -- cautious to a fault. Eeps brother Thunk (The Offices Clark Duke) mom (an underused Catherine Keener) and granny (tart-tongued Cloris Leachman) have all absorbed dads ""never not be afraid"" mantra but Eep is more adventurous. One night she sees the light -- literally a cinder from a torch -- and follows it to find a dashing high-browed comparatively inventive guy named Guy with the voice of Ryan Reynolds a pet sloth and a flair for the dramatic ""The world is ending"" he announces as his sloth rasps a fanfare for emphasis. ""Come with me."" ""I cant"" she replies and returns to her cave. i Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and Eep (Emma Stone) must fight the conservative outlook of Eeps father and convince the Crood family to move. 20th Century Fox hide caption toggle caption 20th Century Fox Guy (Ryan Reynolds) and Eep (Emma Stone) must fight the conservative outlook of Eeps father and convince the Crood family to move. 20th Century Fox Neander-girl meets Sapien-boy and never the twain would meet again except that the very next day Guys prediction starts to come true. A landslide destroys the cave while the family is out and beyond the rubble they find a new world of bizarre creatures. Think The Flintstones on James Camerons Pandora with the Croods nearly becoming crudites for critters ranging from saber-toothed housecats to a flock of tiny razor-toothed birds that look like piranha-keets. For a while I thought there might be a political parable intended here -- Cages conservative dad competing with his daughters progressive boyfriend for the right to chart a path forward for the family of man -- but its pretty quickly clear that the filmmakers dont actually have much on their minds besides jokes. Most of these jokes are based on stereotypes nearly as ancient as the cave drawings the characters occasionally reference -- not just overprotective dads and girls who love shoes but savage toddlers annoying in-laws and subservient moms. If the digital 3-D gorgeousness owes a lot to Camerons world-creating work in Avatar the plot of The Croods is structurally crude -- just a Paleolithic road trip with detours for slapstick and sentiment. Its less about breaking new ground or even breaking in new characters than about creating an Ice Age-style franchise. Still as family viewing its pleasant enough primitive yes but in a digitally sophisticated way thats boisterous funny and will no doubt sell a lot of toys.

The following are brief thoughts on a few of the films in exhibition. The opinions as always are my own. You can find more of my capsule reviews from the festival here and here. Perhaps the most peculiar entrant in competition this year was DreamWorks Animations The Croods--hardly your typical example of a festival film. Featuring vocal performances by Nicolas Cage Emma Stone Catherine Keener and Ryan Reynolds the animated family film is essentially a homo-sapiens-centric Ice Age with higher production values. (In addition to the broad similarities this movies environmentally apocalyptic plot resembles that of the second Ice Age installment and its score carries echoes of its Paleolithic cousin.) Grug (Cage) is the pater familias of a tiny Neanderthal clan that huddles in its cave terrified of the mortal threats surrounding them on all sides. (Family motto ""Never not be afraid."") But when plucky (and hearteningly stocky) daughter Eep (Stone) meets a more inventive Cro-Magnon-esque neighbor (Reynolds) he provides the appropriate lessons in optimism and embracing the unknown. The animation is first-rate with moments of genuine visual imagination and the story while unremarkable is entirely adequate. Kids--of whom there were of course few in evidence at the festival--will almost certainly enjoy it. Related Story Just How Pompous Is Ethan Hawke? At the opposite end of the commercial spectrum is La Piscina the feature-film debut of Cuban director Carlos Quintela. Ambitious in its modesty the 65-minute film chronicles a day in the life of a pool a swimming instructor and his four charges who suffer from various physical disabilities. Alternating between static compositions and portrait-like closeups Quintela offers an intimate minutely observed study in ordinariness. Those in search of shark attacks tsunamis or any aquatic event more notable than a mild dunking should look elsewhere; for the rest Quintelas immaculate film was easily among the best at the festival. Larger in scale--though not by much--is David Gordon Greens Prince Avalanche which somewhat surprisingly won the festivals Silver Bear for direction. (The top prize the Golden Bear was awarded also contrary to expectation to the Romanian film Childs Pose which I did not manage to see.) Following a few tours in the trenches of Apatowian--and sub-Apatowian--comedy (Pineapple Express Your Highness The Sitter) Green returns to his indie roots with this understated adaptation of the 2011 Icelandic film Either Way. Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch star respectively as Alvin and Lance two road workers tasked with replanting signposts and repainting yellow lines following a devastating 1986 wildfire in Texas. Alvin is tightly wound and devoted to self-improvement; Lance (the younger brother of Alvins estranged girlfriend) is slackerish and dedicated to weekends of sexual adventurism. Greens film which follows the duo over the course of a week in the scorched lonesome wilderness is tender beautifully shot and dotted with odd moments of grace.Finally were back to where we began with yet another of the festivals many explorations of the world of pornography. Directed by Michael Winterbottom and starring Steve Coogan (who last paired for the delightfully flimsy distraction The Trip) The Look of Love is the first of two upcoming biopics of British club owner and skin-mag magnate Paul Raymond. (The next one will star Tom Hiddleston best known for playing Loki in Thor and The Avengers.) A playboy of Heffnerian proportions--far greater in fact if the yardstick is net worth--the charming Raymond succumbs to all the customary Y-chromosome temptations sex drugs sex and more sex. The film veers from the usual script in that it is not he who is ultimately crushed by the wheel of Karma but his over-indulged daughter (Imogen Poots). Like its festival sibling Lovelace Winterbottoms well-crafted film evolves from picaresque to tragedy--though in this case perhaps owing to its gender perspective it makes a stronger impression in the former mode than the latter. Worthwhile but hardly obligatory.Here again for those who missed them are my two earlier installments from Berlin. I hope to weigh in with thoughts and predictions on the Oscars later in the week.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you. Youre not his audience you never were and you never will be. Hes playing this game in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. And hes winning too in a different way from anybody youve ever seen. Continue Reading Scott Morgan / Reuters How Millennials Ruined Democracy Jon Grinspan Not the people--the term. How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

Do our Facebook posts reflect our true personalities? Incrementally probably not. But in aggregate the things we say on social media paint a fairly accurate portrait of our inner selves. A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project. ""But its very difficult to study well-being at a large scale. It costs a lot of money to administer surveys to see how people are doing in certain areas. Social media can help with that.""

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started--not by big men with self-control and restraint but by little men--the ones moved by fear and pride.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

Thankfully thats not the case where co-writer/director Chris Sanders is concerned as his work on ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" is completely indicative of the experience youll have with ""The Croods"" which is to say a supremely positive one. This Chris Sanders fellow knows how to craft a heart-warming animation and if not for a few minor problems this would have had a legitimate shot at the best animated movie of 2013. Amazingly if youre looking for a visual cinematic comparison to ""The Croods"" youd have to first mention ""Life of Pi"" or ""Avatar"". Thats not hyperbole as this lush rendering of early B.C. Earth is a wondrous visual spectacle on par with those landmark films. Bright pink birds crazy looking plants blue tigers - ""The Croods"" is a movie that takes time with all the details. It looks fantastic and the visuals alone should keep adults and families entertained. Just to fully dip into the used car persona where ""The Croods"" is concerned thats not all The comedy is firmly in place and as with ""How to Train Your Dragon"" the punchlines come from everywhere and yet nowhere. The film isnt set up in the traditional ""lesser"" animation style of ""Hotel Transylvania"" ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" or ""Shrek 2"" where you can absolutely see the joke being constructed via bodily humor lame puns or pop culture references. Instead ""The Croods"" goes the observational comedy route thats been a joy to watch in films such as ""Bee Movie"" and ""Toy Story"". However and just to differentiate this film from the largely awesome Pixar works the comedy employed here is of a more oddball and quirky variety. Where Pixar is often clever ""The Croods"" is regularly wacky and this brand of humor elevates the material to having actual comedic value always a welcome surprise where films aimed at younger audiences are concerned. Kudos firmly in the front of our minds lets take a beat to factor in a few of the flaws in ""The Croods"". The major structural problem is the lack of villain. While not an issue where an animation team is looking to make an innovative film ""The Croods"" makes it a problem by trying to force-feed tension to the audience in the form of Crood family leader Grud (Nicolas Cage). It should be said that this is Cages best performance since well ""Kick-Ass""? Or maybe ""World Trade Center""? Its been a rough decade for Mr. Cage hopefully ""The Croods"" proves he can at least deliver great voice work when called upon. But back to that false tension Grugs character flaw is that he hates change. As a caveman hes focused on survival implementing strict cave rules and preaching to his family to always be afraid of everything. Thats all well and good for the opening 30 minutes or so but when Grug is banging the same one-note drum well through the hour mark of the film it becomes extremely repetitive. There is also the salient theme that change is occurring no matter who is against it and so this sets up an expectation that Grug will eventually come around leaving us simply waiting for the other shoe to finally drop. The other minor ding and this is only an issue if you have children is that I personally wouldnt take a child under the age of eight to this PG-rated film. There are moments of lava peril copious deaths and more than one hunter-killer animal that thrusts the Croods into hysterics. Perhaps children are growing up quicker than ever but my imaginary five-year-old would be terrified of this movie. Still for the eight to eleven range ""The Croods"" will play in a big way. In terms of the other voice actors Ryan Reynolds sort of redeems himself for the disastrous ""Green Lantern"" film with his work on Guy the young lad who takes on the Crood family as the forced end of their cave-dwelling life leaves them confused and untethered. Eep (Emma Stone) is also a wonderful role model for young girls and boys though its strange that a film about cave people has a far more worthy female protagonist than Oscar-winner ""Brave"" (seriously Academy what happened there?). Overall ""The Croods"" is very solid at building character and thats no surprise given the pedigree of the work. To be completely fair its not as good as ""Lilo amp; Stitch"" or ""How to Train Your Dragon"" but its in the ballpark and being a bronze-medalist in a crowd full of winners is nothing to be ashamed of. Grade B Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and wouldnt be caught dead in a cave for the dampness would ruin him.

Frankly with a title like that you think you know what to expect -- and dread. Lots of gag-worthy gags about prehistoric flatulence probably and every bodily fluid a PG-movie can hold. Except ""The Croods"" is not crude. It is however occasionally a bit prehistoric. There is a lot of slapstick violence; its hero Grug endures (and walks away from) the sort of spine-shattering accidents no cartoon character has endured since Wile E. Coyote. It also has a tendency to put its youngest cavewoman in the tiniest loincloths available and to pile on jokes that were dusty when Fred Flintstone was a child. (Mother-in-law gags? Really?) Still compared to some of the cartoons pushed as family entertainment ""The Croods"" -- which contains no bathroom jokes no power ballads and no painfully obvious PC sermons -- is a bit of a relief. The Croods it seems are a bunch of Neanderthals -- no really -- who spend most of their time in a cave listening to the constant warnings of Grug their aging alpha male. (Favorite advice ""Never not be afraid."") Of course in a fantastic world where just about everything wants to eat you thats not exactly a bad motto. Grugs teenage daughter though -- Eep -- is getting tired of the dark. And when she finds a slightly more evolved male a nerdy Cro-Magnon named Guy she embraces a new world of fire tools and adventure. Naturally Grug is not thrilled. Neither may be some audiences. Although Eep is fit and fearless shes far less evolved than the usual cartoon heroine and not just in the obvious ways; ""The Croods"" isnt about her becoming independent but about her finding a new man to follow. Its feels a bit backward next to ""Brave."" And the world Eep moves through -- while colorful -- is full of the sort of made-up prehistoric creatures that give a paleontologist hives. Compared to ""The Croods"" the fanciful ""Ice Age"" movies could double as dioramas in the Museum of Natural History. But the film has some funny lines (courtesy perhaps of John Cleese who gets a writing credit). Good vocal performances too including Emma Stone as Eep and Catherine Keener as her mother (who with her wonderful crackle actually sounds like her mother). Grug meanwhile is voiced by Nicolas Cage who leavens the wall-to-wall silliness with just the right amount of sincerity. Freed from the usual Nic Cage Act -- that toupee that mugging -- hes actually more normal and likable than hes been in years. Add in those truly imaginative -- if completely fictional -- creatures and some truly outrageous color and you have a film which if not truly sophisticated isnt nearly as crude as advertised. And may be enough as this winter drags on and on to tempt a few parents to finally fearlessly step out of their caves. Ratings note The film contains some scary moments. The Croods (PG) Fox (98 min.) Directed by Kirk De Micco Chris Sanders. With the voices of Nicolas Cage Ryan Reynolds Emma Stone. Now playing in New Jersey.",http://www.nj.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2013/03/the_croods_review_a_modern_sto.html,200,thecroods6,thecroods,nj

When the known world is a mortal threat your cave is your fallout shelter. A Neanderthal in Cartoonland Grud has honed his survival skills sufficiently to lead the Crood brood on a giant-egg hunt that plays like an NFL scrimmage. And like a football coach with a master sergeants mentality he barks out orders-- ""Stay inside the family kill circle"" -- to his wife and kids. His useful wariness though has festered into an almost religious apprehension. ""Fear keeps us alive"" he warns in a sage voice. ""Never not be afraid."" The Croods DreamWorks lively if nothing-new 3-D animated feature from directors Chris Sanders (Lilo amp; Stitch How to Train Your Dragon) and Kirk De Micco taps the familiar dynamic of cartoon families -- the Flintstones the Incredibles and the Simpsons -- to tell a story of generational discord and eventual inevitable reunion. Gruds hot-bodied daughter Eep (Emma Stone) disobeying his stay-at-home rules to go climbing above their rock fortress meets a cool guy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who just happens to have invented fire. The father is cautious the teen girl adventurous her new beau clever in a way that threatens Dad. Guess which one needs to be taught a lesson. For Grud as with Homer Simpson father knows least. (READ Corlisss review of How to Train Your Dragon) To extend the Simpsons analogy Eep is an older tomboyish Lisa; son Thunk (Clark Duke) is a doltish unathletic Bart; mother Ugga (Catherine Keener) is a less fretful less essential Marge; baby Sandy is a feral Maggie (and like the youngest Simpson communicates without words); and elderly Gran (Cloris Leachman) is crotchety borderline-senile Abe with a sex change. That makes Guy one of those smart boys who has a one-episode fling with Lisa. (READ James Poniewoziks take on The Simpsons Movie) This orphan dream-boy is the Thomas Edison of pre-history. Besides fire hes also invented shoes a rough form of instant photography and the domestication of wildlife a monkey named Belt that holds up Guys pants. ""Pets"" he explains to the Croods. ""An animal you dont eat."" A renegade from a slightly future world Guy is as far ahead of the Croods as they are of Gran who sports a reptilian tail. (At least Grud is all-mammal.) Evolution is in fast-forward here and so are the earthquakes volcano eruptions and other geological disasters facing the Croods. Where Grud believed survival meant staying put Guy thinks homesteading spells disaster. Sensing a coming continental shift Guy tells them ""Our world is ending Tomorrow is a place where things are better."" Hes also the first climate-change alarmist. (READ Corlisss review of Lilo amp; Stitch) Originally announced in 2005 when DreamWorks was to produce the movie with the stop-motion geniuses at Aardman Films and John Cleese was hired to write the script The Croods creates two different landscapes the stark monochromatic Caveworld where the family lives barely and the wildly luscious DayGlo Tomorrow area to which they must flee. The palette brought to life by Sanders De Micco and their design team is rich indeed in the perhaps overfamiliar Avatar style and bursting with imaginative fauna from the same bestiary as Maurice Sendaks Wild Things and Chuck Joness Roadrunner critters. (READ Corlisss tribute to Chuck Jones) As Pixar movies have elaborated on the pictorial richness and serious undertone of old Disney classics DreamWorks has updated the knockabout vaudeville shtick and brisk impudent attitude that Jones and other Warner Bros. cartoon directors reveled in. When DreamWorks directors rev into full-farce mode they can manufacture divine lunacy as in last years Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted. (READ TIMEs review of Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted) The Croods shares Madagascars saucy visual sense and its exemplary voice cast; Stones delivery matches Eeps verve and Cage infuses his trademark vocal mopiness with stalwart undertones that indicate the caveman could become a hero. But the family-dramedy genre that the film inhabits demands a bit more narrative ingenuity than is on display. Until a late heart transplant when Grud seizes the plot from the Eep-Guy romance to show that brute strength has its advantages The Croods settles for forcing Grud and Guy into an intergenerational opposites-attract road movie.

"Film Review The Croods | Film Journal International Skip to main content Advertisement Toggle navigation Home News amp; Features Reviews Columns amp; Blogs Industry Guides Distribution GuideEquipment and Concessions GuideExhibition GuideBlue Sheets Film Review The Croods Fast-paced inventive animated comic adventure of a Stone Age family gets an extra boost from the lively vocal performances of stars Nicolas Cage Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds. Mar 21 2013 TweetReviews 1373638-Croods_Review_Md.jpg ""The Flintstones"" may be a bedrock of TV animation but theres a whole generation or three who wouldnt know Fred from Barney Wilma from Betty. So the time is ripe for a new prehistoric family to capture the imaginations of the kid audience and DreamWorks Animations Crood clan does it with dazzling 3D style. A project first developed in 2005 by Monty Python alum John Cleese (who gets a story credit) for stop-motion house Aardman Animation The Croods has evolved into a fast-paced CGI comedy that ranks with the best of DreamWorks recent output. Writer-directors Chris Sanders (How to Train Your Dragon) and Kirk DeMicco (Space Chimps) put a lot into the mix a looming apocalypse a constant battle to survive ferocious predators plus more relatable matters like friction between an overprotective father and a rebellious daughter the blossoming of young love and the thrill of new discoveries. The action is consistently lively enough to delight very young viewers while the character interactions have the kind of nuance that will satisfy their parents or guardians. A hand-drawn opening showing the terrible fates of neighboring families establishes that the Croods are an especially hardy bunch just by virtue of staying alive. Much of that has to do with the justifiably cautious outlook of patriarch Grug (voiced by Nicolas Cage) whose basic philosophy is ""Fear is good change is bad."" But his teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) chafes against his strictures refusing to be part of the familys nightly ""sleep pile"" and often venturing outside alone. One such excursion leads her to Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a much more enlightened (and quite hunky) young primitive who wows Eep with his mastery of the awesome phenomenon we know as fire. But Guy also bears some awful news A great cataclysm is coming and its time to retreat to new terrain. The Crood family (which also includes mother Ugga younger son Thunk feral infant Sandy and Uggas wizened mother Gran) soon find themselves at the center of an earthquake that destroys their sheltering cave leaving them with no choice but to set off for parts unknown. Along the way Eep reunites with Guy much to the annoyance of Grug who resents not only the boys closeness to his daughter but the threat this resourceful young upstart poses to his authority. Beginning pre-quake with rather barren landscapes The Croods expands out to fantastical riotously colorful realms that rival the CG designs of Avatar. And those new horizons are populated with a zany array of fanciful creatures such as bear-owls mini-elephants and a canine/crocodile hybrid that becomes historys first pet. Most fearsome of all are the piranhakeets parakeets with razor-sharp teeth that annihilate every living thing they encounter. Sanders and DeMiccos script has other clever notions including a prehistoric variation on the snapshot Eeps reaction to her first pair of shoes a novel use of puppetry to get out of a dire situation and a giant popcorn explosion which could inspire repeat visits to the concession stand. They also take vivid advantage of the 3D format especially when dust motes and sparks from Guys fire seem to fill the auditorium. One of the non-CGI surprises of The Croods is the fully committed performance of Nicolas Cage. His Grug has every reason to be wary and fretful and hes completely unmoored by the sudden loss of his cave sanctuary and by so much dreaded newness invading his life. This rigid patriarch is the butt of many of the movies jokes but Cage brings real poignancy to his dilemma the kind anyone whos faced a devastating change can relate to. Stone with her appealing feistiness is perfect casting as Eep and Reynolds gets to apply both his leading-man charm and comic timing to Guy who is initially overwhelmed by the roughshod lifestyle of this family on a lower rung of the evolutionary ladder. Catherine Keener brings her usual warmth to the underwritten role of mom Ugga while comedy veteran Cloris Leachman shows sass as Gran whose constant hectoring inspires the very first mother-in-law jokes. Watch out Flintstones the Crood era has begun.

Grug Crood faces the familiar challenges of any parent. He works hard to feed his wife and three kids he cant stand his live-in mother-in-law and he butts heads with his teen daughter. But for Grug (voiced by Nicolas Cage) a good day means none of his family members has been a predators dinner.This patriarch of a prehistoric family lives in fear and its easy to see why. The six of them used to have neighbors but they were either eaten or died from disease. Now the Croods are alone huddled in a cave for days on end.While their situation sounds dire ""The Croods"" is not. The DreamWorks animated film has enough slapstick humor furry sidekicks and zippy 3-D action sequences to keep the story light. Light or more accurately fire is what changes the familys life. Daughter Eep (Emma Stone) grows tired of her fathers doomsday warnings. (""Darkness brings death"" he tells her and ""Never not be afraid."") She sneaks out of the cave one night and meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a boy who knows how to spark a flame. With Eeps curiosity comes Grugs biggest challenge He has to learn to let go. Cage hasnt done much work of note lately but here he is surprisingly lovable and conveys with warmth the concern and frustration of dealing with his independent daughter. Stone makes Eep determined without veering into brattiness. Turns out she really may know whats right for the family.The rest of the Croods provide comic relief especially the grandmother (Cloris Leachman) who gets some of the biggest laughs.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 22 2013 1201AM EDT Last updated Friday Mar. 22 2013 1203PM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Kirk DeMicco Chris Sanders Written by Kirk DeMicco Chris Sanders Starring Nicolas Cage Emma Stone Catherine Keener Ryan Reynolds Classification G Genre animation Year 2013 Country USA Language English Fans of the Ice Age movies will experience prehistoric deja vu with the latest DreamWorks animated film The Croods the tale of a Stone Age family on a road trip from their geologically precarious cave home to a safer territory.With colourful textured 3-D landscapes initially reminiscent of the American Southwest of John Ford or Wile E. Coyote and later the rain-forest lushness of Avatar and FernGully theres lots to catch the eye. But even the lively visuals and unrelenting thrill-ride pace cant disguise rough-hewn storytelling or the fact that the tale of a old-fashioned macho cave dad and his family seems a bit yabba-dabba done that already. Multimedia The Croods The official trailer Originally announced in 2005 under the title Crood Awakening the movie was intended to be a collaboration between DreamWorks and Britains Aardman Animations (Wallace amp; Gromit Chicken Run) although the only relic of that is a story co-credit to John Cleese and a vestigial tale of our species evolution from risk-adverse beginnings to becoming more adventurous creatures. All of this is encapsulated in the story of a teenaged cave girl Eep (Emma Stone) and her quest for freedom.Under the watchful eye of slope-headed father Grug (Nicolas Cage) whose motto is ""never not be afraid"" Eep and her family have survived when most of their neighbours have died off from various natural disasters and illnesses. The price for survival has meant spending a lot of time in their dark cave with a boulder rolled up to the opening so Eep who has a Cabbage Patch Kids doll face and stocky Amazonian curves that fill out her animal skin takes every opportunity to sunbathe and venture outside their home canyon.Other Croods include the mother Ugga (a wasted Catherine Keener) and a thick-skulled nine-year-old boy Thunk (Clark Duke) both of whom unquestioningly go along with dads program. The family wild cards are mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman) whose character is the object of antediluvian mother-in-law jokes. Best perhaps is the baby Sandy (Randy Thom) a fierce scuttling evolutionary throwback who proves useful when the family hunts as a pack when dad declares ""Release the baby"" which could become a household catchphrase.Why this family fare focuses on teen romance isnt clear although Eep is clearly an ancestor of a long line of oppressed female protagonists from The Little Mermaid through to last years Brave and Hotel Transylvania. Will a slacker Stone Age young dude arrive and win her heart? Of course he will complete with a skate-boarder bangs and a chiselled abs and the easy-to-remember name Guy (Ryan Reynolds).Guy introduces Eep and her family to some way-out ideas like fire and shoes. He also wears some sort of lemur thing around his waist called Belt (Chris Sanders) which might as well be called ""requisite cute sidekick animal."" But his apparent laid-back style disguises a different kind of worrier. A bit of a pre-Old Testament prophet he warns the Croods that the world they know is about to end through some major seismic activity.The Croods are obliged to head out to safer place along with Guy though the reluctant Grug continues to be dubious and jealous of the interloper until predictably he starts to wise up. With new dangers introduced almost by the minute the narrative is busy to the point of incoherence with an occasional clever action sequence.An initially amusing but quickly tiring trick involves various mix-and-match animal inventions including ""piranha birds"" ""bear owls"" and a pet ""dog-crocodile"" which reinforce the notion that The Croods is really little more than an Ice Age/Flintstones hybrid. While paying lip service to the spirit of invention and adventure the movie doesnt do much for the evolution of childrens animated entertainment.

Id like to take back all those times I said Nicolas Cage was one of the most annoying actors on film. It turns out hes equally terrible when hes only on the soundtrack. And yet Cage is the least of the problems with ""The Croods"" an animated comedy about cavemen whose writers took things a little too literally when they were told to write Cro-Magnon humor. Daddy caveman Grug (voiced by Cage) spends a lot of time getting hit by lightning crushed by boulders and screamed at by his mother-in-law (Cloris Leachman). When his daughter Eep (Emma Stone who must have one of the least interesting voices in Hollywood) meets a cute guy named er Guy (Ryan Reynolds) Grug keeps him stuffed in a hollow log. Daddy is what you might call a cultural conservative He teaches the frustrated Eep and his wife (Catherine Keener) and son (Clark Duke) to fear everything mainly because every other family has been killed by wild animals war and disease. Failing to appreciate that Dads caution is the only reason shes still alive Eep finds Daddy lame in the tradition of every daughter since the dawn of man. The films message is that you have to get out there and try bold new things which is a strange point to make when youre rehashing ""The Flintstones"" and ""Ice Age."" As in ""Ice Age"" theres a big opening set piece involving a madcap chase for an object (in this case an egg) much like Scrats elusive acorn. And as in ""Ice Age"" the cast spends a lot of time wandering the landscape in search of something funny. Grug loses the family cave in a rock slide and suggests everyone head out for a randomly chosen destination because ""It just feels right."" Im not sure which screenwriters manual writer-directors Chris Sanders and Kirk De Micco were working with but the ones Ive glanced at generally agree that characters should be working toward an important goal not trudging along for no particular reason. Unless were talking screenwriting a la Jean-Luc Godard. Various dangerous or odd critters (such as a skunk-odile) come and go peril is survived in ways that are silly without being funny and theres lots of bickering and scream takes. Most of the dialogue doesnt even get close to being funny; it just fills in the spaces between the pratfalls. Every so often someone attempts an actual one-liner but these invariably sound like they come from writers who prepared for the movie by having actual boulders dropped on their heads. Grug for instance says to Guy ""OK Smart Guy now what?"" And Granny recalls of an earlier romance ""He was a hunter I was a gatherer. It was quite a scandal"" Gran lets slip that shed drop dead of a heart attack if Grug ever came up with a new idea so he spends a few minutes doing wacky and unpredictable things like putting a wig on his head ""I call it a rug rhymes with Grug"" he says. And I call this movie crustier than a Paleolithic fossil.

Starring Nicolas Cage Ryan Reynolds Emma Stone Catherine Keener Clark Duke Cloris Leachman Director Chris Sanders Kirk De Micco Running time 132 Release Opened Mar 22 2013  Editorial Review Mammoth fun with a messageBy Michael OSullivanFriday March 22 2013Think of ""The Croods"" as the back story of ""The Flintstones"" before that modern Stone Age family got well modern. Like Fred Wilma and Pebbles the heroes of this cute animated comedy are animal-pelt-wearing proto-humans. Unlike the protagonists of the old Hanna-Barbera cartoon however hunter-gatherers Grug Crood (voice of Nicolas Cage) and his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener) dont live in an amenity-filled house but in a dark depressing cave. Theyre raising their kids -- Eep (Emma Stone) Thunk (Clark Duke) and Sandy (Randy Thom) -- as best they can considering theres no Internet. Rounding out the clan is Uggas elderly unpleasant mother. Voiced by Cloris Leachman the character contributes nothing to the evolution of the shrewish mother-in-law stereotype of sitcom fame. This world is a scary place filled with saber-toothed tigers and other dangerous beasties. Thats one nice thing about this film. Because of the prehistoric setting the filmmakers were free to imagine all sorts of wondrous extinct critters of which there is no evidence in the fossil record. A swarm of tiny red birds for example whose carnivorous appetites seem to place them as closer cousins to piranhas than to parakeets figures prominently in the plot and is a visual treat. So is a colony of angry blue monkeys. At times the films 3-D vision of the so-called ""Croodaceous Era"" resembles the fantastical candy-colored jungle of ""Avatar."" When the Croods who have spent too much time in a cave discover rain and stars for the first time theres a sense of discovery for us too. In other words its a good-looking story. Driving that story forward is the character of Eep a restless teen who chafes at her fathers dictum ""Never not be afraid."" Sneaking out of the cave one night Eep encounters Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a more advanced Homo-sapiens-like adolescent who has already discovered such conveniences as fire shoes pants and a belt. Actually thats Belt a sloth-like pet whose long lithe arms Guy uses to keep his pants from falling down. Guy has discovered something else too The world as Eep knows it is coming to an end thanks to shifting continental land masses. That leads the sloping-foreheaded Grug and his family of knuckle-draggers -- for whom brawn has always compensated for their distinct lack of brains -- to throw in their lot with the more fearless Guy after an earthquake destroys their home. Off they all go in search of the Dawn of Man. ""The Croods"" is light fare but it explores a serious theme if only superficially. Thats the importance of cooperation -- and the evolutionary advantage of altruism -- in the formation of human society. Will that notion occur to anyone among the films target demographic of crumb-snatchers and rug rats? Probably not. ""The Croods"" is also just good goofy fun for a generation too young to have met Bamm-Bamm. But for those of more precocious intellects it offers a little something extra to chew on besides rock-smacking slapstick and a brontosaurus burger. Contains mild peril.

Traveling across a spectacular landscape the Croods discover an incredible new world filled with fantastic creatures -- and their outlook is changed forever. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Surprisingly clever fast-paced but smart enough to pause for a touching family moment or two ""The Croods"" is an evolutionary leap beyond the similarly themed ""Ice Age"" series. In both story lines our prehistoric heroes must race to safety while volcanoes and earthquakes wreck their environment. ""The Croods"" from a story by John Cleese takes the idea further higher and deeper making it a charmingly human comedy while retaining the hyperkinetic physical humor that made ""Ice Age"" a kiddie juggernaut. Its the kind of rib-tickling emotionally satisfying universally appealing effort that gives computer animation a good name. The voice cast for this caveman farce is wonderful. Emma Stone plays independent adolescent Eep Crood with her trademark velvet rasp introducing us to her world where sudden death is all around. Predators mosquitoes and even the common cold have struck down so many neighbors that her protective dad Grug insists that his clan stay in the safety of their cave all day long. The fact that Grug is played with neurotic helicopter-parent inflections and modern cadences by Nicolas Cage amplifies the humor of every line by a factor of 10. No teen wants to be cooped up with her mother (Catherine Keener) idiot brother (Clark Duke) and grandma (Cloris Leachman) so Eep sneaks outside to follow a bright thing she has spied. Its fire wielded by a brainy explorer named Guy (Ryan Reynolds.) Eep develops an instant intense crush. Hidebound but well-meaning Grug is resistant to change (his credo is ""Never not be afraid""). He opposes the match. When an earthquake obliterates the cave they have no choice but to fall in squabbling behind the new guy. The new habitat is a glorious menagerie of evolutionary misfires ingeniously conceived parrot piranhas crocodile dogs flying turtles and huge sabertoothed kittens. The intensely detailed creature design and psychedelic plant life are like an ""Avatar"" gag reel. And they look amazing. Here as on ""Wall-E"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon"" ace cinematographer Roger Deakins serves as a visual consultant. DreamWorks Ryan Reynolds voices Guy. This emphasis on Seussian misfires of natural selection is fun in itself but also illustrates the storys theme. It advances the main idea that our lives our children families and cherished beliefs all have to change over time in the face of new challenges. Grug begins to feel his time is past as Guy thinks his way through challenges that Grugs head-on physical approach cant resolve. The pair learn to work together however in a dilemma that requires them to escape from a tar pit by means of a puppet show. In a rather brilliant twist Guys work with the dummy doesnt produce the desired effect. When Grug takes control of the makeshift marionette delivering a typically over-the-top Nicolas Cage performance he saves the day.

"Review The Croods lacks a spark of fire - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview The Croods lacks a spark of fireEven with a stellar cast of voices and striking 3-D effects the animated film about a prehistoric family on a road trip during the continental divide is short on substance fun and heart.March 21 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic A scene from ""The Croods."" (DreamWorks Animation )Its not a good omen for ""The Croods"" about a likable family of Paleolithic cave dwellers when a joke about ""the first joke"" falls flat.I dont fault the actors. The character voices provided by Nicolas Cage as the Croods cautious dad Grug; Emma Stone as Eep his rebellious teenager desperate to get out of the cave; Ryan Reynolds as Guy the outsider who sees the future; Catherine Keener as ever-patient mom Ugga; and Cloris Leachman as cranky Gran are spot on.But ""The Croods"" was primed for problems before its 3-D characters found themselves right in the middle of the first continental divide.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsThe movie does deliver some Crood amusement thanks to its cast a no pun intended this is about as innuendo-free an animated movie as weve seen in a while.The animation Stone Age-enticing isnt the problem either.In fact animation turns the cataclysmic times that created the continents and frame ""The Croods"" into an imaginatively striking 3-D experience a lava flows earthquakes crumbling mountain ranges fleeing beasties. The cataclysm also works to expose all the fractures and fissures among the Croods clan too. Its a family crisis Its a global crisis Its a road trip Huh?No one really expects animated comedies about prehistoric times to get into the science in any serious way. So the reality that the continental drifting began more than a billion years ago and we only stopped dragging our knuckles and started using our brains in relatively recent times isnt the issue.The comedy fault line is.If Chris Sanders and Kirk De Micco a the writing-directing team a wanted us to hang in there for the entire road trip ""funnier"" ""more emotional"" and ""more substance"" would have gone a long way to curb the ""Are we there yet?"" crowd. That would be the adults and a fair share of the kids in the audience.STORYA With The Croods in top spot Olympus will fall to No. 2How Sanders who was the creative force behind the enchanting ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or De Micco who has collaborated on a couple of scripts with John Cleese came up so short on the story is mystifying. Dont look for any Monty Python-esque influences from Cleese who is credited with having a hand in developing the story either; they are harder to find than a dinosaur egg. The movie is more like play-it-safe Grug than clever interloper Guy a far too straight-laced when it desperately needs to loosen up.When we meet the Croods their life is one of anxiety and hardship. Days are spent searching for food. Going after one particular egg becomes a family flag-football like affair fueled by fear. Nights are spent huddled in the cave while Grug paints stories on the walls a the simplicity of that act is among the nicest animation in the film. The tales however are terrifying all the calamities that could befall the kids if they break the rules. Kind of like campfire stories except the Croods are waiting to witness that first spark.Instead of fireworks the Croods have Eep who scales sheer rock walls with moxie to get a glimpse of the world beyond the cave and her family. Her brother Thunk (Clark Duke) is still a growing boy Gran is an old pain and Sandy the toddler is a little like having a rabid squirrel in the family. Quite simply shes lethal.In a pattern that probably even preceded the Croods everything about the family equilibrium changes when Guy shows up. Hes got lots of new ideas and the kind of fetching forehead a caveman could only envy. Sparks fly from the first moment Eep and Guy spot each other and not just because of the torch hes carrying. Literally like Jeff Probst on ""Survivor"" hes got fire.STORY Evolution of ""The Croods""The rest of the movie will be the old familiar tug of war between the dad whos afraid for his daughter to grow up and the guy who wants to steal her away. That the world is coming apart at the seams is what finally gets the family on the road where they are beset by all manner of difficulties a including some of the blandest conversations to ever take place in treacherous times.The never-ending series of tight spots they find themselves in on their way to ""tomorrow"" as Guy has named the future require Guy and Grug to come up with new-fangled ways to get out of them by using their ""brains"" another Guy-ism. Even though Eep is feisty its still a mans world.Good stuff comes when bad stuff happens; thats when some of the movie animation prowess kicks into high gear. But too many of the ""solutions"" the guys concoct are so impossibly complex or just downright ridiculous a puppetry comes to mind a that like the continents its a little too easy to drift away.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE TIMELINE Violence in movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe evolution of The CroodsMarch 20 2013Like 2009s movies?

Credit DreamWorks Animation ""The Croods"" makes a better study of Stone Age sociology than it does a childrens movie. But its colorful and has an appealing central character and -- who knows? -- might even give the little ones something more challenging to think about than its tired main plot.First about that plot Once again a rebellious presumably teenage girl Eep is butting heads with her overprotective father Grug. Criminy; is there no other family dynamic available for exploration out there in animated-movie land? Anyway Grug (the voice of Nicolas Cage) is intent on keeping Eep and the rest of his prehistoric family safe in their cave. His mantra ""Never not be afraid."" Curiosity and exploration are bad.But Eep sneaks out and encounters a young stranger Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has an encyclopedic level of knowledge compared with what the Croods have managed to accumulate. There are also hints that he is of a different higher-functioning species which puts the budding romance between Eep and Guy in a crossbreeding zone that modern paleontologists are still debating.In any case the movie is at its most interesting and amusing when riffing on how cavemen might have reacted to new experiences and ideas like fire and shoes. Whether the kiddies will appreciate that is unclear but theyll certainly like the voice work done by Emma Stone as Eep. She puts refreshing spunk into a character who otherwise is alas doomed to follow the same old story line.""The Croods"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) because as Grug knew the prehistoric world was often a scary place.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 648 p.m. EDT March 21 2013A visually dazzling animated adventure with a well-chosen voice cast is hampered by lackluster humor and a meandering story.Eep (Emma Stone) left Thunk (Clark Duke) and Grug (Nicolas Cage) explore an unknown world in The Croods.(Photo DreamWorks Animation)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review 1/2 out of fourStars Nicolas Cage Ryan Reynolds Emma Stone Cloris Leachman Clark Duke Catherine KeenerRated PG; Runtime 1 hour 38 minutes; Opens Friday nationwideThe Croods are no modern Stone Age family.Led by the fearful closed-minded patriarch Grug theyre an animated version of early Homo sapiens but they dont drive rough-hewn vehicles work at prehistoric factories or use bones for hair ornaments.In fact this clan of cave-dwellers tends to cower within stone walls. Fear has kept them alive insists Grug (voiced by Nicolas Cage).As depicted in The Croods (  1/2 out of four; rated PG; opens Friday nationwide) these folks are a close-knit family. Too close-knit for Grugs resourceful teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) who chafes at the strict limitations imposed by her father. And frankly Grug is a bit of a Neanderthal dunderhead. Cage plays the overprotective lunk with just the right notes -- its his best performance in a long time.STORY Nicolas Cages roles are as eclectic as his tastesVIDEO Ryan and Blake attend The Croods premiere MORE Latest movie reviews from USA TODAY""Never not be afraid"" is Grugs double-negative reminder to Eep as well as his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener) son Thunk (Clark Duke) and mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman). The couple also have a baby girl who just grunts growls and groans.The spunky Eep longs to see more of the world. As well she should since the landscape they inhabit can be quite visually stunning. But shes forbidden from leaving the cave after sundown.Eep slips out one night and inadvertently meets fellow teen Guy (Ryan Reynolds) whos roaming the world solo with a fearlessness that Eep admires. Reynolds gives Guy a lively likable personality and a PG-rated flirtation blossoms. Guys look is reminiscent of Hiccup the young creature whisperer in How to Train Your Dragon the charming 2010 animated feature also helmed by Croods co-director Chris Sanders. (He shares that duty here with Kirk De Micco.)Eep is chastised by her dad for running off but soon Grug and the family have bigger problems. When continents shift and their cave is destroyed the Croods must take off covering strange and wondrous turf in search of a new home.Along the way they encounter colorful hybrids of prehistoric animals. Their circle soon incorporates the nomadic Guy whose bold ideas and more evolved brain threaten Grugs limited worldview.The plot suffers from an occasional formlessness and includes well-worn cartoon staples such as the cranky granny the doofus younger brother and an adorable furry sidekick Guys pet sloth Belt (Sanders). The creatures recurring singsong line will likely elicit the most giggles from the youngest viewers.Grug and his Crood brood face up to their fears and learn to tackle the unknown and embrace uncertainty. The message of harnessing your courage while still looking out for family is a worthy one.The familys name may indeed be pronounced ""crude"" but gross-out humor is thankfully kept to a minimum. Yes theyre simple strong and primitive but not vulgar.The use of 3-D has its imaginative moments along with its more prosaic ones. The pace is brisk and occasionally slapstick and some amusing situations stem from the cavemen displaying brawn over brains.More than anything the striking spectacle of primordial flora and one-of-a-kind fauna makes it easy for audiences to get pleasantly lost in the adventure.The Croods clip ShoesSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Guy (Ryan Reynolds) shares his invention of shoes with Grug (Nicolas Cage) and his family. 13 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/Y1rxBg",http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/uampINJLbZU/,200,thecroods17,thecroods,usatoday

Share Tweet By Tom Russo Globe Correspondent | 03.21.13 | 156 PM Our notion of the modern Stone Age family gets a tweak in ""The Croods"" the latest bit of 3-D rock candy from DreamWorks Animation. Instead of a caveman world thats infrastructurally a lot like ours only with foot-powered sedans its a world thats emotionally a lot like ours with experience-starved teens and overprotective parents butting heads. But then with prehistoric beasties and tectonic catastrophe waiting at every turn we can see where the rents are coming from. Emma Stone voices Eep a cutely brutish cavegirl (think Fiona from ""Shrek"" only with worse posture and better skin) who yearns to see whats over the horizon. Or out there in the dark. Or at least beyond the monotonous confines of her familys craggy canyon home. But the movie does an entertaining job of impressing on us what a struggle survival is at the dawn of man. Its an all-hands-on-deck family action episode just to snag a few precious drops of proto-emu egg yolk. Theres lots of cleverly rendered anthropological skittishness in response to the unknown -- which is virtually everything. And for Eeps dad Grug (Nicolas Cage cartoonish in every sense) ""new"" is inherently synonymous with ""deadly."" So Eep isnt going anywhere.

Shes lured from her cave by Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a semi-evolved wanderer with chiseled features instead of a sloped forehead an ability to kindle fire and an understanding that cataclysmic geological change is coming. Soon hes got the entire family joining him on a visually colorful quest to get to higher safer ground with Grug disapprovingly furrowing his monobrow throughout. (The rest of the likable Crood brood includes Catherine Keener as the mom Clark Duke as Eeps brother and Cloris Leachman as their resilient granny -- source of some nettlesome-mother-in-law humor that feels like a further ode to ""The Flintstones."") Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Some of the exotic landscape the group trailblazes looks imported from ""Avatar"" -- happily bringing that immersively dimensionalized eye-catching quality along with it. If the flora is familiar though the fauna is unique as animators Chris Sanders (""How to Train Your Dragon"") and Kirk DeMicco (""Space Chimps"") clearly put in extra hours brainstorming their dizzying stampede of hybrid critters. Among the species that ""Ice Age"" overlooked owl-headed wildcats gator badgers flamingo-spliced piranha giraffe-spotted elephants and land whales. The filmmakers also work overtime to knead a satisfying resolution from their themes about the importance of growth and living life unafraid. But they cop out on a scene in which Cages character takes his instinctual protectiveness to a surprising extreme. Just as the whole group is about to be swallowed up by the Big One Glug selflessly -- well we wont spoil it. Well just say that had the movie figured out a way to stay the less-cliched course it might have helped the DreamWorks oeuvre take steps toward Pixars emotional resonance. Now that would have been evolving. Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com.

The prehistoric Crood family (and friends) wave to their patriarch as they near the end of their journey in the DreamWorks comedy ""The Croods."" Photo DreamWorks Animation The Croods review Creative romp 1 / 1 Back to Gallery The Croods Animated comedy. Starring the voices of Nicolas Cage Emma Stone Ryan Reynolds and Cloris Leachman. Directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders. (PG. 96 minutes.) With so many second-rate animated films falling back on crudeness and bodily function humor when they lack a good script it was fair to worry that ""The Croods"" would set a low in the genre. There are signs of the apocalypse here but those are only plot points. The prehistoric family comedy from DreamWorks Animation is a creative romp light on focus but with plenty of ingenuity. There is no shortage of stock characters to adorn lunch boxes and fast food kid meals. But even the gratuitous cute animal sidekick - a lemur-like creature named Belt who is used as a fashion accessory - feels pretty original. Directors Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders seem hell-bent on avoiding ""The Flintstones"" comparisons creating an environment thats closer to James Camerons ""Avatar"" world than the Paleolithic era audiences are used to. This is (sort of) explained later but largely irrelevant. The filmmakers establish early on that theyre playing by their own rules. The Croods include family leader Grug dense son Thunk and our heroine Eep a Cro-Magnon version of Jennifer Grey from ""Dirty Dancing."" Tension is created when she meets Guy whose use of tools and fire leads to a rift with her fathers brute-force ways. An early hunting scene with the Croods sets the kinetic tone which seems heavily influenced by old Chuck Jones/Warner Bros. cartoons. They hunt like a pack of animals but their diction is that of a 21st Century dysfunctional family. This leads to many subversively clever moments - the children complain about a bath before we learn that hygiene involves Mom hanging the family up like rugs and beating them with a stick to knock the dust off their bodies. ""The Croods"" is filled with this kind of throwaway violence but the directors establish Coyote/Road Runner rules early on where 300-foot drops off cliffs and getting pinned under falling boulders are both survivable comic moments. Sanders co-directed ""Lilo and Stitch"" which had a similar mix of playful mayhem. Timing is everything with slapstick and these filmmakers have good instincts. The movies biggest problems are with pacing especially when dealing with the vague threat that drives the conflict. There are two or three too many scenes where the Croods are running from something. The third act puts a family member in peril and then milks that drama beyond what one would expect from an animated comedy. But even when the mood gets dark the colors stay bright. This DreamWorks Animation film was made in the Redwood City studio which also made ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and the underappreciated ""Megamind."" The animated world is well rendered with blasts of near-psychedelic flora and fauna and the 3-D seems like more than an afterthought. Considering the fact that a young girl is picking her nose on the movie poster ""The Croods"" is surprisingly evolved. Peter Hartlaub is The San Francisco Chronicles pop culture critic.

That partnership dissolved as did early plans to have John Cleese co-write the script.What remains co-written and co-directed by Kirk DeMicco (Racing Stripes) and Chris Sanders (Lilo amp; Stitch) is something that seems far removed from its original intent.The premise of a family of Neanderthals learning to cope with a violent world has been dumbed down to the point of knuckle dragging with even the scary monsters reduced to the equivalent of plush toys. The end result is something thats neither as thrilling nor as funny as it ought to be.The Croods starts off strong with Emma Stones teenage Eep explaining via voiceover narration the dilemma of her title brood. Having survived the animal attacks rock slides and diseases that claimed their tribal neighbours she and her family now endure lives of perpetual terror.During daylight hours Eep and her father Grug (Nicolas Cage) mother Ugga (Catherine Keener) brother Thunk (Clark Duke) non-speaking baby sister Sandy and grandmother Gran (Cloris Leachman) forage for food the best they can constantly dodging danger. An early egg hunt provides the films best action sequence.""Never not be afraid"" shouts the ever-vigilant Grug.By night they barricade themselves in a cave behind a giant boulder.Eep tires of routine and longs for longer stays in the sunshine. She escapes from the suffocation of ""the family kill circle"" and strikes out in the big bad world whereupon she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a much more evolved specimen of early humanity.Guy who may be Justin Biebers earliest ancestor has learned how to create fire and also how to make designer blue jeans and footwear (apparently he invented Ugg boots). Hes also convinced that the world as he knows it is about to undergo a radical transformation -- an Ice Age maybe? -- so hes heading to the presumed safety of distant twin mountains.He tarries too long with the buxom Eep (theres more than one flame sparking) and before Guy knows it hes got her entire family in tow for the trek to the misty mountains. Most of the family is up for the trip but Grug is suspicious of Guy and his intentions. A cave collapse forces the issue but doesnt smooth rocky relations.This should be more than enough material with which to craft a decent yarn but The Croods doesnt evolve much past its primitive design. The journey is colourful with the landscape shifting from desert to tropics but the family never seems to be at serious risk from wild animals that are more Seussian than scary.The filmmakers may have misjudged their audience. They aim low enough so that tots wont be terrified but adults teens and older children may well be bored by the blandness.And speaking of bad judgment why have a sharp guy like Nicolas Cage voice a Neanderthal whose brain cells cant process much more than fearful warnings and bad jokes about mothers-in-law?You shouldnt expect too much logic in a cartoon caveman story but a few script inconsistencies rankle. Why have the Croods learned to talk and make clothing but havent figure out how to make and use fire? And why are they so surprised when they discover a body of water? What have they been using for liquids?On the plus side The Croods avoids the crude humour that the title practically demands. And the film earns laughs from the antics of baby Sandy who is like an attack version of Pebbles Flintstone and from the clownish dramatics of Guys monkey sidekick which is fond of shouting dah-dah-dahJust plain monkeying around beats knuckle dragging any old time.Peter Howell is The Stars movie critic.

(AP Photo/DreamWorks Animation) (DreamWorks Animation)By Tirdad Derakhshani Inquirer Staff WriterPosted March 23 2013Life isnt easy for the Croods the cave-dwelling Neanderthal family in DreamWorks Animations latest offering The Croods a visually dazzling if empty-headed 3-D family action-adventure powered by some serious computer-generated animation and A-list voice actors.The Croods are a tight-knit family of six headed by patriarch Grug Crood (Nicolas Cage) and his wife Ugga (Catherine Keener) who live in a cave in a vast barren landscape populated by the odd bird tiger lemur or dino. Odd indeed Codirectors Kirk DeMicco ( Space Chimps) and Chris Sanders ( How to Train Your Dragon) dont even pretend at realism filling their movie instead with brightly colored fantastical flora and fauna.Grug isnt the sharpest tool in the shed but hes fiercely loyal and protects his family with all his might imposing on them a strict routine - wake up hunt for food rush back to the cave before sundown. The world is a dangerous place Grug keeps telling his kids.""Fear is good; change is bad"" is the Crood family mantra.Not so for Grugs eldest child teenage rebel Eep (Emma Stone) who breaks all the rules including the most dread command of all Dont ever leave the cave at night. She does and one night she runs into the first non-Crood boy shes ever met a dashing guy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who wanders around in the dark carrying with him a most wondrous thing called fire.Guy is way evolved He has fire he can make tools and he has befriended animals including a long-tailed furry pet named Belt (Chris Sanders) who wraps around his waist and holds up his pants.Guy persuades the Croods to leave cave life behind leading them west through many crazy adventures. Guy teaches them how to use tools how to swim how to cook. And most of all how to enjoy themselvesAfter many moons Guy brings them to a place called Tomorrow. A lovely place.The Croods offers very little for grown-ups It has none of the clever subversive wit wordplay or imagery that made DreamWorks Shrek series so appealing to parents and kids alike. (Its hard to believe the story was conceived by Monty Python alumnus John Cleese.)For all that the movie is well-edited and lean a fast-paced action-filled bit of froth that manages to be diverting and surprisingly fun. The Croods 1/2 (out of four stars) Directed by Kirk DeMicco and Chris Sanders. With the voices of Nicolas Cage Ryan Reynolds Emma Stone and Catherine Keener.

(DreamWorks Animation) BY Miriam Bale NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 21 2013 321 PM THE CROODS -- 3 stars With voices by Nicolas Cage Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds A prehistoric family journeys toward the sun. Directors Kirk De Micco Chris Sanders (138). G. Area theaters. Theres a peculiar violence in the comedy in this CG-animated family film similar to watching a loud slapstick football game played by extraordinarily ugly plastic figures. Of course the Croods are not meant to be beauties -- they are after all a family of Neanderthals. But is the animation meant to be ugly too? The sitcom-style jokes are coarse as well. Prehistoric patriarch Grug (a disappointingly tame Nicolas Cage) is an oaf while his mother-in-law (Cloris Leachman) is a hungry hag. Catherine Keeners marvelously husky voice is under used as mother Ugga but this is essentially a story about father daughter Epp (Emma Stone) and Epps first love Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who holds not only Epps affections but also fire and tools. The whole family agrees to leave its collapsing world and follow Guy through psychedelic deserts and neon aquatic forests heading toward that giant blazing yellow ball. The film is best when speculating on the origins of human nature. Why for instance do we keep pets or love watching the horizon? When it gets past the Stone Age humor this weird film manages to find some gentle revelations. GIMME THE LOOT -- 4 stars With Ty Hickson Tashiana Washington Two Bronx kids cross the city on a mischievous mission. (137). Not Rated. IFC. A slight idea flawlessly executed ""Gimme the Loot"" centers on young Yankees fans Malcolm and Sofia who attempt to be the first to tag the Mets home run apple at Citi Field with graffiti. But first the two broke teens need to come up with 500 to carry out their scheme. Newcomers Tashiana Washington and Ty Hickson shine in ""Gimme the Loot."" Theyll do anything to fund their plot yet the film stays consistently fun rather than gritty. Tashiana Washington is lovely and natural as Sofia but its charismatic Ty Hickson as Malcolm who emerges as the star. The newcomers have great chemistry in a romantic story of friendship and street life in this cross-borough summer adventure. Director Adam Leon 31 has slyly and reverentially crafted a perfect New York movie including the class tensions relentless hustling and spontaneous connections that best define the exuberant strain of the city. The soundtrack filled with mostly soul oldies somehow feels exactly right for the sweaty New York summer of this scrappy kid-venture.

Although state-of-the-art in its rendering of textures movement and stereography DreamWorks latest 3D toon ""The Croods"" adopts a relatively primitive approach to storytelling with its Flintstonian construction of stock ill-fitting narrative elements. Part family adventure story part romance and part eye-popping thrill ride this tale of a prehistoric family seeking a new home in a dangerous and geologically volatile environment wont have the broad appeal of DreamWorks ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"" pics or Foxs own B.C.-era ""Ice Age"" franchise. But it should prove a solid earner after its March 22 release in a frame relatively free of rival predators. Conceived in 2005 under the catchier title ""Crood Awakening"" with John Cleese and trade journo-turned-agent-turned-screenwriter Kirk DeMicco (""Racing Stripes"") set to script ""The Croods"" was intended to further DreamWorks collaboration with Aardman Animation (""Chicken Run"" ""Wallace amp; Gromit The Curse of the Were-Rabbit"" ""Flushed Away"") before the two companies parted ways in 2006. DeMicco and animation vet Chris Sanders (""Lilo amp; Stitch"") share scripting and directing duties with Cleese co-credited for the story. The main element from ""Crood Awakening"" that seems to have survived the transition to the screen is the premise of brutish cavepeople who meet a more evolved humanoid with clever ideas up his fur sleeve like how to make fire. But instead of the original projects quasi-Neanderthal community the core characters here are a frightened family of six called the Croods seemingly the last of their species after natural selection has chewed its way through their neighbors. Enjoined by patriarch Grug (voiced by Nicolas Cage) to ""never not be afraid"" the Croods hunt as a pack by day and huddle in a cave by night to hide from a delightfully designed bestiary of made-up monsters such as the self-explanatory Bear Owl and the Macawnivore a colorful saber-toothed tiger variant roughly the size of a rhino. Grugs wife Ugga (Catherine Keener); doltish son Thunk (Clark Duke); tart-tongued mother-in-law Gran (Cloris Leachman); and ferociously belligerent toddler daughter Sandy (""Release the baby"" is one of the pics funnier catchphrases) are all content to stick to the routine. But teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) longs for broader horizons and a literally brighter view of the world. Enter Guy (Ryan Reynolds) the only survivor of a family that judging by his svelter frame more erect posture and higher forehead must have been a bit further up the evolutionary ladder. Although most of the Croods are impressed with Guys innovations like fire and shoes Grug wants no truck with this young hotshot whos winning Eeps heart or any of his newfangled ideas. However when it starts to look like Guy may be right about the world breaking up they have no choice but to seek greener pastures. The main problem with the film is that the script simply isnt very funny and its various subplots never quite mesh satisfyingly together; apart from Grug Eep and Guy the other characters add little to the proceedings apart from a few feeble jokes. Yet these story deficiencies are fairly well papered over by the pacey smoothly animated action scenes delivered at regular intervals. Highlights include an early hunt with a football-like egg passed from character to character that gains much from well-timed Wile E. Coyote-style slapstick; and a nifty escape sequence involving volcanic eruptions sticky tar and of all things makeshift puppets. Younger auds will be hypnotized by the pics scorching color palette particularly in the ""Avatar""-like jungle setting and throughout the animators have lavished loving attention on how different kinds of light (moon sun fire) play on the surfaces of skin fur and landscape. Presumably its in this area that ace lenser Roger Deakins lent his services as a visual consultant as he did on DreamWorks ""How to Train Your Dragon."" Character design however is less adroit although the Croods stocky simplistic figures will lend themselves well enough to merchandising. Onscreen theyre not terribly appealing and Eeps helmet-like hair and East German weightlifter physique make her a somewhat awkward match with the spindly Guy even if its laudable for the animators to have designed a young heroine who doesnt fit the usual Barbie-doll proportions.

"The Croods movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Croods Projects evolution unkind to animated cave dwellers  The Croods Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Its ""Ice Age"" with humans and less ice. ""The Croods"" began life nearly a decade ago as ""Crood Awakening"" a collaboration of DreamWorks Animation and Aardman Studios with a script co-written by John Cleese. Then Aardman creators of the great Wallace amp; Gromit and the very good ""Chicken Run"" fell out of the development.Years later here we are Another DreamWorks movie perpetually on the run desperately full of action because slapstick violence translates more easily to a global marketplace than the artifact known to the old folks as ""a joke"" or rarer ""wit."" Cleese retains a story credit but ""The Croods"" is strictly in the manic vein of the ""Ice Age"" movies box-office forces of nature and exercises in perpetual bickering and wall-to-wall cliff-to-cliff cliffhangers. The modest satisfaction provided by ""The Croods"" comes from listening to Nicolas Cage have some fun with the voice of Grug Crood married to sensible Ugga (Catherine Keener) and father of three. Theres little Sandy a feral pre-verbal Bam-Bam type; her thick-headed older brother Thunk (Clark Gregg); and the storys narrator the eldest Eep (Emma Stone).Co-director and co-writer Chris Sanders worked on DreamWorks high-water mark of late ""How to Train Your Dragon."" As with ""Dragon"" ""The Croods"" rests on the notion of the patriarch who must learn to adapt and let go. (I resent this storyline for the record.) Earthquaked out of their cave dwelling the Crood brood embarks on a search for a new home. Theres an interloper Eep encounters an advanced caveboy with impressive low body fat (Ryan Reynolds voice). The caveboy Guy is not just a pinup; hes a harbinger of humankinds future. He knows about fire for example (""the sun is ... in his hands"") and has things called ""ideas."" These nomads must learn to learn from each other as they dodge attacks waged by such fanciful species as Piranhakeets deadly toothy flying creatures who can strip a carcass faster than you can say ""potential new animation franchise.""Grug and Guy and Eep and Ugga and Thunk and Sandy and Uggas flinty mother (Cloris Leachman stuck with a one-note mother-in-law joke for material) search for a place Guy calls ""Tomorrow"" somewhere just over there by the mountains where survival lies and a generation gap can be breached.To justify the 3-D directors Sanders and Kirk DeMicco shape ""The Croods"" as an extended peril seminar. As usual with this photo-realistic animation style the digital crispness comes at a cost Each smack in the head or fall from a great height landing in a ""OOOOmmmmmkkph"" doesnt really play like a sight gag. Its closer to action-movie violence slightly toned down. The landscapes desert to tropical certainly are varied which is more than you can say about the characters. At least theres Cage who has become an astute voice actor finding some odd clever energetic line readings consistently fresher than ""The Croods"" itself.mjphillipstribune.com The Croods -- 2 starsMPAA rating PG (for some scary action)Running time 131Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Animation (Movie Genre) The Croods DreamWorks Animation John Cleese Nicolas Cage Chris Sanders Cloris Leachman Who are the early Oscars 2014 favorites?

Share Tweet In the animated adventure-comedy The Croods the eponymous family of Neanderthals is forced to leave the relative safety of their cave where theyve successfully dodged the adapt-or-die proposition that has wiped off their equally less evolved neighbors. As they make their way into the wider world with all its attendant dangers and wonders theres never any question where the film stands in the conflict between ignorance and knowledge security and open-mindedness living life to its fullest and doing everything possible not to die. And yet the film itself doesnt practice what it preaches From the typically blocky DreamWorks CGI to the emphasis on bruising slapstick over verbal wit The Croods takes the low road at every opportunity giving lip service to enlightenment while following a Flintstonian instinct to keep punching the clock at the quarry. Still the fact that it constantly undermines its own message doesnt entirely diminish its base appeal. A breathless opening hunt sets the tone as the Croods a family of six led by fear-mongering patriarch Grug (voiced by a lively Nicolas Cage) seek sustenance from a giant bird egg and wind up in a routine fight for their lives. Left mostly defenseless against exotic foes--fire is not yet part of their repertoire--Grug his wife (Catherine Keener) his mother-in-law (Cloris Leachman) and his three children hole up in a cave most of the time cowed by their predators. But Grugs teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) proves more adventurous and her resolve deepens when she meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) a young man several notches up on the evolutionary scale. When their home is destroyed the Croods follow Guy across an uncertain landscape toward the land of ""tomorrow"" whatever that may be. Because it already cheats by having a humanoid dude like Guy co-exist with cavemen The Croods smartly severs all connection to prehistory by inventing exotic creatures (an ankle-high stampede of elephants a flock of parrot-like birds that attack like a school of piranha) and sending the characters through a variety of storybook landscapes. The rivalry between the dumb-but-protective Grug and the clever-but-smug Guy is a little predictable but co-writers/directors Kirk De Micco and Chris Sanders have a talent for evading problems with montages like a snappy sequence that contrasts Grug and Guys approaches to problem-solving. In that case and others The Croods makes up in barreling speed what it lacks in smarts.

And in ""The Croods"" dad literally falls a few steps behind on the evolutionary ladder while the world really is changing complete with lava earthquakes and continental drift. After the dreary ""Ice Age"" movies made Pangaea tedious and stridently unfunny its a thrill to get a movie that gives tectonic shift a good name. This new effort from writer-directors Chris Sanders (co-director of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" and ""Lilo amp; Stitch"") and Kirk De Micco (""Space Chimps"") offers genuine comedy and compelling characters with dazzling visuals that feature both imaginary beasts (carnivorous birds a candy-colored sabre-toothed cat) and moments that approach photo-realism. The titular stone-age family is led by Grug (voiced by Nicolas Cage) whose motto is ""Never not be afraid."" Between the bleakness of the landscape and the plethora of hungry beasts populating it one could understand Grugs wariness of the world. (""Still alive"" is what the family cries out in unison at the dawn of each day.) But teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) has begun to chafe at dads alarmism and wants to start exploring the big scary world. She sneaks out of the cave one night when she witnesses something dazzling which turns out to be fire carried aloft by Guy (Ryan Reynolds) whos clearly closer to Homo erectus than the jutting-brow Croods. Grug wants nothing to do with this slick visitor and his new ways but after an earthquake destroys the family cave the Croods -- including mom Ugga (Catherine Keener) nerdy son Thunk (Clark Duke) feral daughter Sandy (Randy Thorn) and salty Gran (Cloris Leachman) -- have no choice but to follow Guy into a different world that offers color splendor...and even more danger. This material could have easily fallen into sitcom cliches with a heaping scoop of anachronism jokes on the side but ""The Croods"" takes these characters and their situation seriously enough to make the story matter. When Eep chastises the ever-vigilant Grug for mistaking ""not dying"" for ""living"" its a genuinely powerful moment one that you might not expect to find in a cartoon aimed at audiences of all ages. The cast is terrific -- Cage hasnt been this intentionally funny in eons -- and the directors know how to stage the small stuff (throw-away jokes turn out to be set-ups for bigger punch lines later on) as well as elaborately staged sequences like a food-gathering mission in which the theft of an egg turns into a football scrimmage in which the Croods must maintain possession despite the efforts of fellow predators (not to mention the miffed mama bird). ""The Croods"" is making its way into theaters without a great deal of fanfare but its a solidly produced and thoroughly entertaining animated feature that wont club you over the head with its ideas.

Cast Nicolas Cage Ryan Reynolds Emma Stone. Rating PG for some scary action. By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Mar 21 2013 514 PM Somewhere along the evolutionary line man made the jump from thick-skulled cave-dweller to fire-harnessing smart guy. That might not be the exact scientific progression or description but you get the idea. For someone somewhere the light went on literally and life would never be the same. For him or the rest of us. That progression makes up part of ""The Croods"" the latest animated film from Dreamworks and it would be nice to report that it is the central idea because that would be an interesting concept to explore. Alas it chugs along in the background crowded out by a ""dont be afraid"" theme. Also important but a little less intriguing. Still there are plenty of funny moments in the film basically a road-trip movie which will keep the target audience of kids happy. That and the frenetic action sequences beginning with a chase for food and slowing down only occasionally to develop the no-fear theme and a late-in-the-game father-daughter-bonding subplot. The Croods are a prehistoric clan who live in a cave in the dark in constant fear of ... everything. Ugg (voice of Nicolas Cage) sees to this with his constant warnings. His mantra Never dont be afraid. Its whats kept his family alive while all their neighbors succumbed to the various dangers and diseases of the day. But it rankles Eep (Emma Stone). Shes a teenage girl chafing at her fathers rules. She longs to explore to break free of cave life. And on a late-night excursion she gets her chance. She meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who represents the next step in evolutionary man. He knows how to make fire (and shoes and all sorts of things; hes like a prehistoric Thomas Edison). He also knows a hard truth The continents are shifting. Well maybe he doesnt know that exactly but he does know the earth around him is changing crumbling belching lava and fire and he has to get to higher ground. Ugg thinks its madness but events conspire to make him a believer. But not in Guy. Still Guy is the familys best shot so Ugg Eep and the rest of the Croods hit the road. From there directors Kirk De Micco and Chris Sanders offer up a typical mismatched-characters road-trip movie with Guy and Eepss obvious attraction to each other further angering Ugg. But Guy is an idea man. Ugg is not. And in the new world they find themselves in a lack of ideas is a liability. Maybe a deadly one. OK that sounds more serious than it is. Though some of the funniest moments do involve the notion of death whether its a dog trick gone bad or Uggs constant longing for the ancient evidently indestructible Gran (Cloris Leachman) to expire. And there is a direct lift from a Road Runner cartoon that never gets old no matter how many hundreds of times youve seen it. Cage is good better than hes been in most of his recent live-action films. Ugg wants to evolve as it were. But he has trouble breaking through his fear. (THEME AGAIN ILLUSTRATED IN BIG BOLD LETTERS. As it often is.) Stones spunky personality comes through in Eep and Reynolds is fine as Guy. Catherine Keener is wasted as Ugga (Mrs. Ugg) as is Clark Duke as nitwit son Thunk. (In his defense Thunk is pretty sure he doesnt have a brain.) And Leachman voices the standard wise-cracking old person well enough. Its all well enough. The jokes only make up for the pedestrian plot for so long. There was a time when animated fare with generic stories sufficed. But now we expect more them because they have pardon the pun evolved. ""The Croods"" like its title family hasnt. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook Facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

From the directors behind the superior How to Train Your Dragon Kirk De Micco and Chris Sanders the film takes the point of view of a fiery young girl (voiced by Emma Stone) dealing with being a teenager in the Stone Age and living with her thick-browed and thick-headed family of troglodytes. A freak meeting with the slightly more evolved Guy a swept-haired cavedude voiced by Ryan Reynolds leads the whole clan on an adventure to escape the breakup of Pangaea. They cross a series of lush settings that look more extraterrestrial than prehistoric; the backgrounds owe more than a passing nod to Avatar whereas some of the odd hybridized fauna resemble the animated menagerie of 1973s Fantastic Planet. Nicolas Cage lends his voice to the group?s Cro-Mag pater familias who has taught his kin to avoid danger at all costs and who fears he?s losing his daughter to Guy and his hip new high-tech gadget fire. Unfortunately a handful of adrenalizing sequences of Chuck Jones-style animated anarchy can?t make up for the eye-rolling jokes or the paint-by-numbers emotional beats. A running gag about an insufferable mother-in-law could have been taken straight from the modern-day cavemen on network sitcoms. Its all high-energy but that energy could have been put to better use on a story that didnt feel quite so paleolithic.

Its a strategy dear to the heart of brawny patriarch Grug (Nicolas Cage) and naturally less appealing to curious teen Eep (Emma Stone). But its soon clear that the landscape it is a-shifting and the Croods must adapt or die. The theme of survival in the face of an apocalyptic event casts a bit of a shadow over proceedings making The Croods almost the family entertainment entry into a canon including the likes of Grave Of The Fireflies and Threads. Of course being a DreamWorks animation and possible franchise this isnt a bleak emotional nightmare but a luridly colourful caper that pokes us in the eyes with a succession of lavishly rendered 3D perils too quickly for any abiding melancholy to set in. Its a frenetic approach that doesnt leave much time to meet the family but the characterisations are so broad and accessible (kind mum crabby granny thick son and so on) that this doesnt matter much. Its all entertaining enough and will surely sell plenty of stuffed toys. But it winds up a fair few rungs below the likes of Brave on the evolutionary ladder.

TWITTER Nicolas Cage Emma Stone and Ryan Reynolds lead the voice cast on DreamWorks 3D animated comedy-adventure about a prehistoric family leaving cave life behind. BERLIN -- Two of the principal plot drivers in The Croods are an athletic Neanderthal chick with a wild titian mop top and a rockin bod packed into a tiger-fur sheath and a brainy boy babe with skater-dude hair perfect pecs and the waistline of a supermodel not to mention a pioneering flair for accessories. But the core audience for DreamWorks 3D animated prehistoric family adventure is probably less the tweens and teens those adolescent lovebirds would suggest than the younger tykes who flocked to a comedy franchise situated elsewhere on the paleontology chart Ice Age. PHOTOS Berlin 2013 Behind the Scenes of THRs Actors Roundtable The humor and charm in Chris Sanders and Kirk DeMiccos film is too uneven to help it approach that series mammoth market share. But its mostly fast-moving roller coaster of kinetic action and its menagerie of fantastic creatures - from cute to menacing - should keep kids entertained. Theyll also have no trouble grasping the simple message to face your fears and embrace change. The film evolved out of a project first announced at Cannes in 2005 under the title Crood Awakening which was to reteam DreamWorks with artisanal British toon shop Aardman Animation after successes like Chicken Run. That earlier version was being co-written by DeMicco with John Cleese who retains a story credit here. While his neighbors steadily have succumbed to the perils of the Stone Age Crood brood patriarch Grug (Nicolas Cage) has kept his family safe by sticking to the simple rules mapped out in the cave paintings. His credo is ""Fear keeps us alive. Never not be afraid."" (Grammar obviously isnt his strong point.) ""No one said survival was fun."" Curiosity for Grug equals danger. The hell they have to go through for sustenance is outlined in a dizzying hunting sequence near the start thats like an over-caffeinated pro football game with a giant bird egg in place of the pigskin. Everyone in the family plays a role on the team from wife Ugga (Catherine Keener) to plucky teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) lunkhead son Thunk (Clark Duke) and leathery Gran (Cloris Leachman) Grugs barely tolerated mother-in-law. Even the feral infant Sandy is deployed on cue with the battle cry ""Release the baby"" PHOTOS Berlin 2013 Behind the Scenes of THRs Directors Roundtable But despite their tight synergy the Croods world literally is crumbling around them. Eeps growing rebellion against the physical and mental darkness of cave life also is causing friction with Dad. When she follows the light one night and meets Guy (Ryan Reynolds) with his mysterious invention of fire and his warnings of the destruction to come Eep propels the family onto a quest toward the higher ground of tomorrow. Once shes seen fire and shes seen rain theres no looking back. Aside from the earth opening up beneath them the boulders flying and the predators at every turn the chief conflict is between brawny Grugs belief in his strength and Guys revolutionary reliance on ideas. The protective fathers anxiety over his daughters first crush adds to this still-somewhat-undernourished friction. Guy has a de rigueur animal sidekick in a sloth named Belt (""voiced"" by co-director Sanders) who serves to hold up his pants as well as bring a cheeky sense of the dramatic. Sanders and DeMiccos script doesnt have the robust plotting consistent wit or flavorful character development of the best family animation. And some of the voice actors have too little to work with. Keeners Ugga for instance is a strictly standard-issue caring Mom while much of the humor built around Thunks obtuseness is soft. And like Betty Whites raunchy oldsters Leachmans ornery crones are starting to get as tired as those funky rapping grannies from 90s New Line comedies. PHOTOS 10 Inappropriately Sexy Cartoon Characters With his weary rasp however Cage makes Grug a touching figure -- a knuckle-dragger at first and then steadily more resourceful as he sees the light. Stones smoky-voiced sweetness is nicely paired with the characters butt-kicking physicality (its refreshing to see an animated teen girl more strapping than the cookie-cutter slender-princess model) and Reynolds brings the right note of earnestness to his forward-thinker. Basically a journey tale with its erratic momentum pumped up by Alan Silvestris hard-working score The Croods has its share of rambunctious episodes and frantic narrow escapes. Notable among them is the threat of a tornado-like flock of vicious Piranhakeets razor-toothed birds that can strip a beast to its bones in seconds. ""Stay inside the family kill circle"" warns Grug as they descend. Theres a large assortment of fantasy animals to keep the merchandise division busy among them parrot-hued giant felines dogs with crocodile jaws land-dwelling whales monkeys with killer right hooks and owl-headed bears that owe a debt to Maurice Sendak. These critters give the film more in common with the slapsticky Looney Tunes era than with animation of recent vintage. The Croods mercifully refrains from leaning too hard on anachronistic dialogue for laughs settling for the occasional ""awesome"" or ""sucky."" And its light on pop cultural cross-referencing which also is a blessing. But especially after so many animated movies have raised the bar the shortage of sophisticated humor likely will narrow the appeal here chiefly to the 4-to-10 age range. There are some decent gags built around inventions and accidental discoveries such as snapshots shoes (""Aaahhh I love them"" squeals Eep in her prototype Uggs) and popcorn in a crowd-baiting wink to the multiplex populace. Other touches like the birth of the hug (rhymes with Grug) tap into an innocuous vein of schmaltz. But another polish or two to punch up the script wouldnt have hurt. Aside from teen dreamboat Guy the character animation is not the prettiest; even Eep is slapped with rough-hewn features on an ultra-wide face. But theres considerable imagination in the rendering of the landscapes ranging from barren rock to lush jungle vegetation full of vibrantly exotic flora. Cinematography luminary Roger Deakins is credited as visual consultant his influence perhaps discernible in the glow of stars sun and fire which is fitting given the thematic centrality of stepping into the light after hiding in darkness. Premiering in Berlin ahead of its March 22 rollout via Fox the film screened with incomplete credits indicating that its final running time might gain a few minutes.
