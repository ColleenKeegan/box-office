Cue the new Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) who wakes from her bored stupor and heads to the front of the class to turn a presentation on FDR into a full-on noise-filled participatory experience with vocal percussion. The message from producers Will Smith and Jay-Z is clear. This new Annie is about to blow the old one away. But you know what they say about talking the talk. Stuck between crossed purposes the contemporized and urbanized reboot of Annie manages to fall short (or is it long?) for children and adult fans of musicals alike. Musical fans will be turned off by a movie that overproduces the originals most famous songs filling the musical void with new numbers that might as well be called ""Generic Contemporary Hit Radio Song 1 2 etc."" And kids? Theyre expected to sit for two hours while a plot unfolds about popularity polls and chicanery in the New York mayoral political race. The undeniable charisma of its star aside the entire exercise reeks of meetings about how to turn a story from the 1920s into a straight-up famjam (Urban Dictionary raucous family party). Did this even need to be done? Small children dont know whether something is old-fashioned. Animation styles aside a modern Disney animated musical like Frozen for example is not dissimilar to one from the 40s or 50s. In the reworked story of Annie she is no longer an orphan. ""Im a foster kid"" she loudly proclaims whenever the O-word comes up - a foster kid under care of a drunken Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) who is bitter because of her experiences as a member of C C Music Factory in the 90s. Her evil accomplice is no longer her brother but a weasel political spin doctor named Guy (Bobby Cannavale) who works for a billionaire mayoral candidate named Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx in what was originally the Daddy Warbucks role). The feisty Annie comes and goes from Miss Hannigans brownstone to do things like sit outside her long-missing parents favourite Italian restaurant every Friday waiting for their return. And she becomes a political pawn when Stacks saves her from a traffic accident the video of which goes viral setting the stage for his adopting her as the ultimate campaign prop. Thus is the meandering rich-mans redemption story set in motion. Except that Walliss scenes with Foxx do not have the smooth chemistry of her relationship with Stacks assistant and putative love interest Grace (Rose Byrne). One dance scene between Annie and Grace - celebrating the penthouse lifestyle of the rich and famous - is actually quite fun. Wallis is a charmer who manages to carry this mess when the camera is on her alone. Director Will Gluck (Friends with Benefits) does musical best when hes not overdoing it. His treatment of Hard Knock Life uses found street percussion that actually enervates the song. The rest of the time though the song selection and its presentation seems out of his control.

The script (by Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna) transposes the original Depression-era story to current-day New York where Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) a telecom mogul is running for mayor but cant overcome his public image as an out-of-touch plutocrat. When he chances to rescue the headstrong Annie from speeding traffic his popularity soars; when her story as a foster child in a group home becomes known his campaign managers (Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale) urge Will to take her in--until the race is won. The sentimental story of their growing bond and the obstacles posed to it by backroom dealings is familiar turf but it plays out on unusual ground real-life New York locations. Though Glucks musical numbers lack high style they capture the spice of urban sights uptown and downtown alike and offer a droll paean to the power of social media. The vigorous display of good feelings and comforting resolutions has an unusually effervescent sincerity even if the rags-to-riches wish-fulfillment leaps over all the hard knocks.

Instead the studio suggests take your kids to see Sonys Annie a fresh updating of the 1977 Broadway musical about the adorable orphan who transforms the zillionaire Daddy Warbucks into a benign father figure. Pure escapist fun. Yet a couple of lines from Annie drag audiences back into the Interview mess. One of the movies sympathetic characters the bodega manager Lou (David Zayas) fulminates against IT companies that appropriate ""your information ... so they can spy on you and take your soul."" Later a sleazy campaign adviser named Guy (Bobby Cannavale) boasts of the lowlifes he has helped get elected. One is ""Schwarzenegger."" Ha ha. Another ""Kim Jong Il."" At an Annie press screening on Dec. 13 that line came as such a jolt that I wondered whether I was seeing a pre-hack rough cut of the movie. First of all what election? The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea is a dynasty; Kim Jung Il succeeded his father Kim Il Sung as Un was named the Great Successor when Il died in 2011. And second Why would the studio with two Christmas movies think it was fine to keep a second throwaway Kim gag in its big family musical? That said Im happy to report that Annie opened without incident last weekend and that to my modest surprise the movie isnt totally awful. Based on Harold Grays 1924 Little Orphan Annie comic strip which amused and soothed newspaper readers through the Great Depression the new version casts Quvenzhane Wallis as Annie and Jamie Foxx as the Daddy Warbucks figure Will Stacks. The Broadway score by Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin gets a synthy makeover by Greg Kurstin Aussie singer-songwriter Sia Furler and director Will Gluck. Unlike Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb its rival for underage audiences this Christmas week Annie isnt a candidate for worst movie of the millennium -- despite what you may have heard. Its certainly way more sit-throughable than director John Hustons terminally stodgy 1982 film of the show. In the script by Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna Will Stacks is a Michael Bloomberg type he earned his billions in IT and wants to spend his largesse to become mayor of New York. When Annie is thrust in his path by chance the opportunistic Guy notices Wills low approval ratings skyrocketing and advises him to spend time with the girl. Bringing Annie to his penthouse means prying her from the clutches of foster-mom Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) and giving her a surrogate mother in Wills assistant Grace (Rose Byrne). Annie manages to overcome the political cynicism of Guys enterprise captivate hearts and sing a few old-new hits. Wallis who at nine was the youngest person to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress (for her role in Beasts of the Southern Wild) is 11 now and makes a smooth transition from wild child to domesticated starlet. Shes also a plausibly adorable Annie with her halo of black hair reflecting the comic-strip characters frizzy red mane. Shes given a big solo ballad ""Opportunities"" sung at a fundraiser at the Guggenheim Museum -- which looks like ""a giant cinnamon roll"" -- and aces it. The rest of the movie is a teeter-totter between O.K. and Meh. Foxx and Byrne fill out their stereotypes of Will and Grace the rich man and his girl Friday who need most of a two-hour movie to realize they love each other. An unexpected delight is a scene that wasnt in the earlier version and really has no place here a visit to a movie theater for excerpts from a Twilight parody called Moon Quake Lake with Ashton Kutcher as the hero Mila Kunis as the heroine and Rihanna as the Moon Goddess. It provides Annies brightest few minutes. On the minus side Diazs stab at comic malevolence -- which Carol Burnett turned into a treasure of shabby dipsomania in the 1982 film -- has the odor of desperation until midway through when Guy is revealed as the true villain and Hannigan is humanized by her bodega pal Lou. (Paging the actual modern Burnett -- Kristen Wiig.) The scriptwriters also felt the need to explain song titles from the Broadway show (Girl 1 ""Whats a hard knock life?"" Girl 2 ""One that sucks."") and to point out that Annie names her dog Sandy in memory of the hurricane that devastated the East Coast two years back. Filled with lurches from effervescence to ennui this Annie is a mish-mosh pit that encourages indulgent viewers to dive in and have fun where and if they can find it. If they go with the movies ragged flow they should find it more enjoyable than the 1982 Huston film. It happens that my grumpy review of that Annie stirred a small industry ruckus. I ended the piece by quoting a remark that the movies producer Ray Stark had made to the New York Times ""I can only hope that on my tombstone are the words Annie she is the one I was looking for."" I added ""Funeral services may be held starting this week at a theater near you."" Just a joke right? A few days later Stark sent me a horseshoe wreath of dead flowers emblazoned with a red ribbon reading ""Rest in Pieces."" I wrote Stark a thank-you note suggesting only that he might want to change florists as his wreath to me arrived wilted. And thats how we used to resolve animosities about movies. No high-stakes vandalism or terrorism; instead a larkish little death threat. Ray Stark lived into his 90th year and Im still around. Ill bet that Rogen and Franco are wishing theyd offended an old-line Hollywood producer instead of North Korea. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

"Little People Struggling to Survive Annie and the Final Hobbit Film << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Little People Struggling to Survive Annie and the Final Hobbit Film Sony Pictures Entertainment Movies December 19 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print I have so many questions about this new Annie movie musical. Who gave 11-year-old Quvenzhane Wallis Whoopi Goldbergs Sister Act wig? What took a giant bite out of Jamie Foxxs hairline? And can someone explain all the banging? It starts in the first scene and never stops -- kids whacking their desks and stomping on the floor. This musicals most famous song is ""Its the Hard Knock Life"" (lets just agree that Jay Zs sampling pushed it ahead of ""Tomorrow"") and its taken literally. The effects department gooses every sound so it feels like somebodys trying to break into your house. The early songs have thunderclaps and drum programming that would make Questlove stuff his ears. In the opening minutes theres an actual jackhammer plowing into a sidewalk. Under the circumstances thats not a metaphor. Its an instrument. Why has most of the singing been shot with the actors backs to the camera? You cant tell me that the sense of shame over this movie started on the set Why didnt anyone tell Wallis whos Annie or Jamie Foxx whos Daddy Warbucks -- Im sorry whos mobile-telephone mogul/snooty Obama-era New York City mayoral candidate Will Stacks (its 2014 holla) -- that the only way for a musical to work is to face the fact that youre making a musical? More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverageAnd how does any musical that stars Foxx and Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale get stolen by Cameron Diaz? She cant sing. She can barely dance. But as Annies washed-up tantrum-prone thoroughly drunk Harlem foster mother Miss Hannigan she crashes into walls furniture and musical notes like a wrecking ball. You dont know whether to give her a Razzie or a DUI. But shes something. The best musical moment in the movie is hers. She spends ""Little Girls"" seeing her foster kids appear as coffee tables and chairs with the actual actors pretending to be the actual decor. Its cute Sesame Street staging that she oozes all over. Its the only bit of imagination in the entire production the only moment when the prevailing sloppiness seems intended to make you laugh. The singer songwriter and producer Sia is credited with some of the new songs. She helped reupholster this one. Its slinky and customized for Diazs warbling. This Miss Hannigan is a has-been pop professional (C+C Music Factory and all of that) and her commitment to floozy boozy brattiness gets a workout. These apartment scenes are also something the director Will Gluck can actually handle Anything that happens on a sidewalk or in a street makes you want to call AAA. And yet Did I really just watch Foxx and Wallis do an entire musical number set inside a moving helicopter? I did and Ive never felt more embarrassed for two actors mostly because Foxx seems embarrassed for himself. Wallis the sainted overpraised ragamuffin from Beasts of the Southern Wild doesnt not work in this movie. Shes bright and sassy and street-lingo-ed to the max. When Annies had enough of Stackss paparazzi she throws up her hand and tells them ""Slow your roll."" You just wish Gluck took his time with her. Shes a natural performer. But her version of Annie looks like shell grow up to win an Oscar for Ghost and host The View. Her singing voice is unremarkable -- I imagine the gist of all that jackhammering is to distract from the possibility that most of the people in this movie are more shower singers than singer-singers. You can feel Gluck trying to stage these scenes on a figurative cloud. Hes really straining to pull it off and to hide what he cant. The cuts-per-minute here make watching something by the musical-murderer Rob Marshall seem like paint drying. Nothing makes you feel old like a lousy remake of a lousy musical that was turned into a lousy movie. But all that lousiness? Thirty-two years ago I was in love with it. John Hustons version of Charles Strouse Martin Charnin and Thomas Meehans Tony-winning show is a disaster. Its like watching Al Capone repot a plant. But in 1982 it was my disaster. Huston staged some of the numbers on enormous Depression-era sets. The orphanage seemed the size of a Ford plant with girls leaping on beds and swinging from the ceiling. Aileen Quinn played Annie like the most desperate confident person youll ever meet. She nailed comic-strip pluck and her singing lingers like tinnitus. But I remember every song. I didnt care that Return of the Jedi was coming. I had the cast album to Annie. No one in this remake is Carol Burnett or Bernadette Peters or Tim Curry or even Geoffrey Holder who really had nothing to do but smile -- he was ... Punjab. But his charisma and verticality spoke louder than the movies racism. In Foxxs defense Albert Finney seemed even more miserable as the bald toe-tapping Daddy Warbucks. But I was 7 and I was in heaven. Which is to say that the kids who clapped and whooped the night I saw this movie are probably experiencing their own heaven and will forever treasure Diazs knock-kneed singing as I did Burnetts (superior) interpretation. The spirit that Glucks trying to infuse this movie with is admirable. But why didnt anyone tell him that hes working with a corpse?  Theres no pleasure to be received from the end of Peter Jacksons three-part Hobbit. Untold manpower pixels and money culminate in the gangbusters final installment. It cant redeem the useless tedium of the first two which exist for gargantuan profits and structural necessity. After all You cant have a third floor without a first and a second. But The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies makes a sound argument for ranch-style storytelling -- my copy of J.R.R. Tolkiens 1937 novel The Hobbit or There and Back Again is 300 pages. To arrive at the idea that its an epic you really have to believe in ""again."" What remains to tell of the plot entails at last restoring the films displaced dwarves to their treasure-packed Lonely Mountain which is the rightful dominion of the dwarf warrior Thorin (Richard Armitage) who comes down with a case of the demagogues. He refuses to band together with the Elves and suddenly homeless humans of Lake-town which was turned to flaming ash by Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) to counter the alliance of goblin and Warg armies. Attempting to keep the peace is Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) whose self-protective mix of wonder diplomacy and dishonesty remain the most interesting character traits in these films. Luke Evans returns as Bard the Bowman as do a boatload of other actors -- Orlando Bloom Ken Stott Hugo Weaving Christopher Lee and Ryan Gage who spends his many (many) scenes as a comically sniveling human daring children to call for the death of a fictional person. Cate Blanchett scraps with Sauron (Cumberbatch again). Ian McKellens stoner wizard Gandalf continues to waft through the plot like the smoke from the pipe he tokes while Lee Paces royal elf gives him hilariously bitchy stink-eye. Theres vaguely forbidden love between big elf (Evangeline Lilly) and dwarf (Aidan Turner). And even beneath that hair Armitage manages to turn Thorin into a character of attractive theatrical conflict a guy in need of a power exorcism. Jackson has come to think of himself as a director of vast scale. He can go up and out and over the top. In Five Armies he still has that dazzling sense of fantastical cinematic showmanship. Blanchetts battle with Sauron culminates in a spasm of violent noise and warped psychedelia that satisfies that inarticulably visceral desire to be simultaneously awed and terrified. An hour later Jackson amuses himself by cutting three scenes into a single action sequence any one of which would have been the showstopper of a regular movie. Jackson of course wasnt making a regular movie. With Five Armies he was making all the movies. Surely there was a way to do just one Hobbit -- this one. But the marketplace rewards three so why not? And as a friend of mine reminded me Jackson had that giant production studio built in New Zealand. It employs a lot of people. Chill out. So Jacksons sense of excess is very much a creative (and maybe moral) motivation too much for everybody This new movie is like some cupcake frosting or the orgasmic finale of a fireworks show It operates under the assumption that too much is what we want. Put it this way Too much is better than nothing. But too much would have come in handy five and a half hours and two years ago.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 19 2014 Save for later Saved About video ads About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide This reboot of the 1977 Charles Strouse-Martin Charnin musical by co-writer and director Will Gluck will best be remembered for providing Quvenzhane Wallis (""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") with her first big Hollywood starring role. Shes radiantly charming as Annie and unlike so many of the Annies weve seen over the years she doesnt burst her lungs or try to devour the scenery. As the billionaire magnate running for mayor of New York Jamie Foxx in the Daddy Warbucks role has a touching rapport with her. Otherwise the movie is indifferently directed and for better or worse numbers like ""Tomorrow"" dont exactly bring down the house. Considering this musical has its roots in Depression-era American Glucks contemporary take on the material is eerily lacking in observations about the rich/poor divide in this country. Some original songs have rejiggered lyrics and new tunes have been added to the original score none memorable. Grade C+ (Rated PG for some mild language and rude humor.)

I saw literally the first public performance (a preview) of Annie in the bicentennial summer of 76 at the Goodspeed Opera House in Haddam Connecticut. It was an embarrassing shambles -- a saccharine distaff Oliver -- but even then I knew Id be hearing that goddamn ""Tomorrow"" song for the rest of my life. The show got slicked up for Broadway and became a substantial hit but apart from endless ""Tomorrow"" covers it bothered no one for a few years -- until John Hustons putrid 1982 movie with a baldy Albert Finney doing a Huston impression and Carol Burnett a two-hour drunk act. Leapin lizards was the comic strip even good? It was certainly interesting. Harold Gray had the courage of his libertarian convictions (FDR was Daddy Warbuckss nemesis) and Little Orphan Annie did her best to embody the American corporate-capitalist spirit only accepting handouts from billionaire war profiteers. The strip ran a surprisingly long time before it was pronounced dead a few years ago though the late witty Jay Maeder (once of the New York Daily News) gave it a last dash of savoir faire. Meanwhile Will Smith had snapped up the musical as a vehicle for his daughter Willow. So this could have been worse Willow as Annie with Daddy Warbucks transformed into L. Ron Hubbard. Say this for the beleaguered Sony Pictures it helped us dodge that bullet. One of the best things in the new movie is the opening in which a perky redheaded little girl named Annie delivers a paean to Calvin Coolidge before her class. Then the teacher calls on a second Annie and Quvenzhane Wallis bounds up to the front. Were suddenly in 2014 where African-Americans can appropriate Little Miss Libertarian America for their own rather different ends (there is a halfhearted nod to a social contract) and make it just as dumb. Shes now Little Foster Child Annie living with a few other sad girls at the home of failed singer and successful meanie Ms. Hannigan (Cameron Diaz -- about whom anon). Related Stories How Annie Was Updated for 2014 First a word about Wallis with her sky-wide grin and wider hair Shes the opposite of an insufferable Shirley Temple-like showbiz fireball. She cultivates an inner stillness and shrugs off bad lines. She has evolved beyond cuteness. She moves lightly like a dream. She doesnt have Annies requisite gumption but she has something better grace. Shes a movie star -- but not on the evidence a singer. Wallis is Auto-Tuned up the wazoo. This Annie features what is likely the least effective ""Tomorrow"" of all time although its not principally her fault. The singing doesnt sound like its coming from her mouth and the staging -- it was filmed as she wanders the streets of Manhattan -- has zero urgency. But Wallis gets by. Shes touching (though even more Auto-Tuned) in a not-bad new song by Sia called ""Opportunity"" which will probably show up at the Academy Awards. Her star will only brighten. No one else will be helped by this movie for which we must blame the director Will Gluck. He created a good showcase for Emma Stone in the campy Easy A and didnt disgrace himself with the dim rom-com Friends With Benefits but he doesnt know the first thing about shooting a number in a musical comedy. He takes his cues from music videos. The dances are chopped to hell and whenever the camera happens to be in the right place (it seems by accident) the shots arent held long enough to register anything special about the performers. Borderline intolerable songs like ""I Think Im Going to Like It Here"" cross over the border. Daddy Warbucks is now called ""Will Stacks"" and is a barely socialized billionaire cell-phone magnate who decides on a whim to run for mayor hooking up with Annie after he saves her from being hit by a car. (She was chasing the stray Sandy who will become her loving pooch.) Bringing her into his fabulous high-tech high-rise pad is (as in earlier iterations) a PR stunt and its left to the child to endear herself to the awkward bachelor. What she sees in him other than  is a mystery. Foxx doesnt cut it as a simpleton rich boy and would probably have been targeted for ridicule if not for Cameron Diazs disastrous Miss Hannigan -- a disaster thats not Im convinced of her own making. Any decent director would have taken one look at the dailies and told Diaz to take the garishness down about ten notches -- to stop twisting up her features and shrieking her lines as if to say that she (Cameron Diaz) is nothing like Miss Hannigan and is doing character acting. The conception of Hannigan -- not an orphanage mistress but a bitter unemployed showbiz reject taking in foster kids to get money from the state -- is workable and Diaz can be a wonderful comedian. If shed played the role in the spirit of her sexy Bad Teacher she could have knocked this out of the park. She still pulls off one of the shows best numbers though the breathy plaint ""Little Girls"" largely because its the first (and only) time she relaxes and lets us see her features. Bobby Cannavale as Stackss sleazy PR strategist succeeds with sheer Broadway slickness and Stephanie Kurtzuba has a funny moment or two as a strenuously indifferent Russian child-welfare bureaucrat -- until the movie turns her into a ditz. As Stackss lonely buttoned-up assistant Grace the spectacularly self-assured charismatic Rose Byrne has to pretend shes none of the above and isnt convincing for a second. Theres a fun scene where Hannigan auditions people to pretend to be Annies parents (Hannigans lowlife cohorts Rooster and Lily are gone and not missed) but the script by Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna is otherwise a stinker. I imagine Annie will make a mint though which might offset some of Sonys losses from deep-sixing The Interview. But in all the ways that matter its a missed opportunity to take a flawed musical and transform it into a powerful new myth with a particular African-American slant. The black angle is neutered and the movie not just a dud but a humiliation.

Barry Wetcher/Sony Pictures hide caption toggle caption Barry Wetcher/Sony Pictures Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhane Wallis star in the latest incarnation of the musical Annie. Barry Wetcher/Sony Pictures The sunll come out tomorrowBet your bottom dollar that tomorrow therell be sun There is a thing that happens with songs where when youve heard them enough times you stop hearing them at all. They are less pieces of music than cultural baubles that pop up to stand for styles or sentiments or eras. Long ago ""Tomorrow"" became not just the song that stood for Annie but for many people -- both those who like musicals and those who dont -- a song that stood for precocious children belting earnestly to the patient exhaustion of nearby adults. Consider the scene in Nora Ephrons Youve Got Mail where the wealthy family of Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) listens to its charming preteen sing the song with nervous imperfect happiness. Its not just a song; its an anthem of young girls with big voices and young girls with small voices who dream of having big voices. I was 6 years old when Annie opened on Broadway in 1977. I was in the sweet spot a generation in which a lot of girls took that music to heart -- ""Tomorrow"" and ""Maybe"" and ""Hard-Knock Life."" We had the cast album and I knew all the words and I still do because thats how it works. I cant remember TV shows that aired in 2012 but if I play ""Youre Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" in the car my mind and my voice retrieve it intact like a warm blanket from a cedar trunk. I didnt even know what a lot of these words meant then -- ""Who cares what theyre wearing on Main Street or Saville Row?"" -- but theyre in there anyway. It would never have occurred to me at that age that I might have more easily seen myself in that record that show that iconic image of the little girl with the big voice because like practically every little girl I saw in popular culture she was white. The original musical Annie is a period piece set during the Great Depression but aside from the one scene where she put on the fluffy red hair the Annie in the photos I saw looked a lot like me. Dont get me wrong -- plenty of little girls loved Annie who werent white and plenty of boys loved Annie and so forth. But when youre a little kid it doesnt hurt to have commonality with the people being presented to you as cultural icons. Or maybe its better to say it can hurt I think to almost never have it. There is already a perfectly good filmed version of Annie thats charming straightforward well-executed and quite faithful to the original musical if thats what youre after. Its not the 1982 film directed by John Huston -- that one is pretty bad. Its the 1999 version made for television starring Victor Garber as Daddy Warbucks Audra McDonald as Grace Kathy Bates as the mean Miss Hannigan Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth as her rotten brother and his girlfriend and Alicia Morton as Annie. (Note It was directed by Rob Marshall whose Into the Woods is about to open.) That is a good production and we dont necessarily need another along those lines. The new film is not along those lines; it is pretty radically different. Directed by Will Gluck it stars Quvenzhane Wallis as Annie Jamie Foxx as Warbucks replacement and tech mogul/mayoral candidate Will Stacks Rose Byrne as Grace Bobby Cannavale as a political consultant who functionally takes the place of Rooster and Cameron Diaz as Miss Hannigan. Its been doubly updated The musical was a 1977 piece about 1933; this is a 2014 piece about 2014. Here Annie is not living in an ""orphanage"" per se but in a crowded foster home where Hannigan still an alcoholic and now a refugee from a busted music career warehouses kids in exchange for meager assistance checks. (Diaz is a hoot and I had to respect the way the joke about her past in a band pays off with one late joke that seems to justify the entire runner.) When Stacks and Annie have a chance encounter Cannavales conniving operator convinces him that taking a foster kid into his home for a while will win him votes. If you love the original musical know that this is not that. The music has been largely transformed into sweetened highly produced modern radio pop which I personally find enormously less pleasurable than the original songs. Some songs have survived largely intact particularly the opening trio of ""Maybe"" ""Hard-Knock Life"" and ""Tomorrow."" But beyond that its mostly numbers that nod at the original music before veering off into songs that are either entirely new for the film nor so different that youll barely recognize them. ""Youre Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" for instance is here only as a Sia pop rendition used to score a fantasy scene. The score frequently includes pieces of songs that are never actually heard as if to reassure the audience that this is not forgetting the shows roots but specifically acknowledging them and setting them aside. Whether you find that actually reassuring probably has a lot to do with your perspective. It seems fair to point out though that if the new music is vulnerable to the accusation that it sounds too produced and synthetic the original presentation of Annie on Broadway was vulnerable to musical digs of its own. Certainly your classical singers would have dropped their teeth at young Andrea McArdles high belting chest voice which really does sound at times like it would hurt to sing that way for very long. Returning to the original cast album makes me warmly nostalgic but also makes me sympathetic to adults who felt at the time that they were listening to entire songs made up of children yelling. We may be in a time of enthusiastic snark but we did not invent the tsk-tsking of the displeased particularly in the case of entertainment for children. Despite any reservations about the music it is a charming lovely little movie. Wallis who was nominated for an Oscar for Beasts of the Southern Wild remains a naturally affecting young actress and her Annie retains the ingenuity and resilience that is more important to the character in the end than the Depression setting and the red hair. What has always been most poignant to me about Annie was her conviction deep and real that her parents were gone only temporarily and would return for her. And the films way of conveying that which takes Annie back over and over to the only place she can think of to wait for them is quite touching. What they do with Jamie Foxx as a germophobic entrepreneur (hes quite funny) is necessarily different from the model of Daddy Warbucks old-school rich dude. But there are interesting trade-offs that come out of the updating process. While I much prefer the originals ""N.Y.C."" to the new films ""The City Is Yours"" when it comes to songs about the draw of New York the song isnt the only thing about that scene that changes here. In the original ""N.Y.C."" is a comfortable rich mans salute to the city he loves sung as he wanders through it ""The citys bright as a penny arcade; it blinks it tilts it rings."" Warbucks represents established royalty; in order to capture New Yorks appeal to strivers they throw in a verse from an aspiring actress ""N.Y.C. tomorrow a penthouse thats way up high; tonight the Y."" Here ""The City Is Yours"" on the other hand finds a black billionaire in his helicopter arguing the citys promise to a young black foster kid ""Nows the time youve gotta stand tough; cause if you work hard you can rise up."" Life is of course not that simple. But while I dont love the new song that new dynamic between the characters is perhaps more interesting and relevant than revisiting the New Deal would have been. (The original show actually features FDR making the Cabinet sing ""Tomorrow"" and has a song called ""A New Deal for Christmas"" which is literally about ... the New Deal.) Stacks is sort of both Warbucks and the actress in that sequence -- speaking to both the dream and the hustle it takes to get it. He is having a more substantive conversation with Annie than comes out of just showering a kid with stuff. ""Rise up."" ""Stand tough."" Theres a consciousness in that scene of the odds Annie is actually facing thats largely missing from the fully fantasy-bound original. Gluck is a director with a history of making films that are better than they could have been in other hands 2011s Friends with Benefits starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis is a solid contemporary romantic comedy and 2010s Easy A with Emma Stone as a high school student dealing with rumors about her sex life is terrific. I dont think Annie is quite as interesting as either of those but its fun and its funny. The endearing thing about ""Tomorrow"" despite all thats happened to it over the years is that when you actually listen to it its ideas are elemental Most things are not the end of the world. There are chances for things to go better. Hope is real. I could be possessive and sniffy and negative and I could catalog the differences between what I loved more and what I loved less. But every generation deserves its own Annie pressing that idea that hope is real in whatever way reaches them the best. Different ways at different times hopefully looking like different little girls. Is it a great movie? No. Am I glad they made it and did I enjoy it? Yes.

COURTNEY SHEA Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Dec. 19 2014 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Dec. 19 2014 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Will Gluck Written by Will Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna Starring Quvenzhane Wallis Cameron Diaz Jamie Foxx Classification PG Country USA Language English Last winter I was taking care of my friends kids who were 3 and 5 at the time. After plying ourselves with chicken fingers and chocolate we decided to watch a movie. They wanted an umpteenth viewing of Ice Age 2 but I had other plans We would watch my own childhood favourite Annie.Ill admit that as the opening titles rolled I wondered how this personal touchstone - one featuring a pack of not-animated drably dressed orphans FDR and the Great Depression - would play with my young companions who are coming of age in an era where childrens entertainment is as targeted and methodically crafted as designer drugs. Globe and Mail screen grab Video Video 2014 in six songs How The Globes Broadsheet Music project came together The New Radicals Video Ballet for urban spaces I neednt have worried though. Turns out that engaging characters infectious melodies suspense drama and dance extravaganzas appeal to children of all eras.If only the powers that be behind the new Annie movie had kept this basic truth in mind.Its not that I was ever thrilled at the prospect of a reboot - aint broke and so on. Still I get it Recycling the classics for new audiences has emerged as a reliable cash cow for movie studios right up there with comic-book-hero franchises and Liam Neeson action flicks.I vowed not to be the sort of narrow-minded curmudgeon who would close my heart to the potential of a new project just because it wasnt the Annie of ""my day."" For starters the 1982 John Huston version is itself a remake of the 1977 Broadway show (no doubt it received its share of curmudgeonry from theatre purists). And regardless of whos wearing the red dress the power sources of Annie are its song-and-dance numbers. Nobody I assumed would be foolish enough to mess with that pre-established magic. (Spoiler alert ...)The reboot is directed by Will Gluck - an odd choice given his slim resume and lack of musical experience. In it Annie (played by a suitably plucky Quvenzhane Wallis) is a 10-year-old who lives in Harlem with a pack of sing-songy fellow foster-kid friends. Their caregiver is a failed pop star turned prolific vodka drinker Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz).One day Annie darts into traffic and is saved by Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) a telecom billionaire who is running for mayor and suffering from a likeability crisis. A recent clip of him spitting out mashed potatoes in the faces of homeless people has gone viral because you know its 2014.Annie 2.0 is packed with such arent-we-modern details Hannigan wants to be on MTV; Annie becomes a social-media celeb after Stacks invites her to move in with him (see aforementioned likeability issue); Stackss home is a sleek Manhattan penthouse with no staff. ""I prefer to be alone"" he explains both to his young house guest and also to theatregoers old enough to remember the singing butler and the dancing chambermaids and the rest of the gang who filled Daddy Warbuckss sprawling estate with so much life and energy. When Annie sings I Think Im Gonna Like It Here (butchered into auto-tuned ear-abuse in this new version) its difficult to imagine why any 10-year-old would.Of the movies dozen musical numbers only three are relatively unmangled versions of their predecessors. The rest are either aggressively not-catchy new songs or ""reimaginings"" (read pointless electro-laced ruinings) of once winsome fun such as Youre Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile and Easy Street. Note that its not impossible to update this sort of music as demonstrated by Jay-Zs awesome hip-hop version of Hard Knock Life (1998). Further note that Beyonces better half is a producer of the new Annie and was originally attached to do some music. The fact that he didnt makes me wonder if he saw where the project was headed and opted to save his reputation.Rep-control seems to be at the heart of Foxxs performance which is fine but it feels like he cant wait to get in an eye-roll after each take. Diaz on the other hand goes all in shouting and rubber-facing her way through migraine-provoking music and nudge-nudge jokes about Hootie amp; the Blowfish and how musical theatre is inherently lame (but wait a sec ...). Its the type of humour that - like Diaz herself - felt fresh in the mid-1990s which is maybe an unnecessary and heartless thing to say but having recently sat through Annie unnecessary and lacking heart are top of mind.All of this being said there is still a pressing question to address which is whether or not young people will like this movie. The answer is that they probably will - its loud and colourful and theres a scene in which the orphans go to a party with all-you-can-shove-in-your-mouth candy. Its even possible that Diazs drunken antics will elicit underage laughs but were talking cheap thrills.The notion that any child of today will be waxing poetic about this movie 30 years from now is as inconceivable as the fact that Carol Burnett didnt get a Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Miss Hannigan in 1982. And so - to quote that vile and magnificent woman - do the little pig droppings in your life a favour and download the Huston version instead.

Photo Barry Wetcher/Sony Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Annie Running time 119 minutes. Rated PG (mild rude humor). At Empire the Harlem USA others. Leapin lizards The evergreen Broadway musical ""Annie strays far from its Depression-era roots with truly dismaying results in this crass charmless tin-eared and lead-footed update. The worst Hollywood musical so far this century its another misstep for Sony Pictures which also sponsored the abortive The Interview. Minus her trademark red hair and no longer technically an orphan this still-spunky 21st-century Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) was abandoned as a baby in a Greenwich Village restaurant. Her latest of many homes is a Harlem apartment where mean Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) a failed pop diva keeps Annie and three other foster children busy tidying up while they all live on the 157 a week she collects for each of them. This films version of ""Daddy"" Warbucks is called Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) a billionaire cellphone magnate who is running for mayor for no apparent reason other than that the plot calls for it. He is so cold uncomfortable with the public and germophobic that he goes viral on YouTube after spitting out mashed potatoes he is supposed to be serving to a homeless man. When Will saves Annie from being run over by a car his unctuous campaign manager Guy (Bobby Cannavale) sees an opportunity for his candidate to catch up in the polls to incumbent Mayor Harold Gray (Peter Van Wagner as a character who is barely seen even though he shares a name with the cartoonist who created Annie in 1924). Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) and Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) take Sandy (rescue dog Marti) for a walk.Photo Barry Wetcher/Sony pictures Annie is delighted when Will invites her to come share his luxe penthouse (filmed at the 4 World Trade Center office tower) -- and for the next hour the film drops all pretense of a plot and turns into heavy-duty real estate porn accompanied by hideously percussion-heavy arrangements (with tweaked music and lyrics) of the original Broadway songs by Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin. As in the original Hannigan -- this time in cahoots with Guy (her brother Rooster has disappeared) -- eventually tries to cash in by producing a couple who pose as Annies ""real"" parents. But theyre no match for Will who has grown to love Annie as well as his ""vice president"" Grace (Rose Byrne) who still acts like a secretary despite the title. Theres no FDR in this version -- except for a token mention in the opening scene -- and Annies famous dog Sandy barely figures in the action but there is a very awkwardly staged climactic helicopter ride to Jersey City where NYPD patrol cars mysteriously show up. Stacks listens as Annie sings ""Opportunity"" at a black tie event at the Guggenheim Museum.Photo Barry Wetcher/Sony pictures John Hustons 1982 ""Annie isnt great but at least it had a young star (Aileen Quinn) who could dance and sing with authority. The charismatic Wallis who received an Oscar nod for the gritty indie ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" barely passes muster in either category. The other girls in ""Its the Hard-Knock Life"" dance rings around her and it seems downright cruel to require Wallis to perform with a 25-piece orchestra at the Guggenheim Museum in one of many pointless scenes. Foxx hasnt seemed so utterly disinterested in a role since his last major musical ""Dreamgirls"" (2006) -- and Byrne while perky is certainly no threat to Ann Reinking (Grace in 82) in the dancing department. But the real lump of coal in this threadbare Christmas stocking is Diaz who is at her scenery-swallowing worst as Hannigan -- outdoing even Carol Burnetts ghastly performance from 32 years ago. Cover your ears during her duet with Cannavale who unlike Diaz can actually sing. Director Will Gluck did a fine job with ""Easy A and ""Friends With Benefits but this much larger production -- produced by Will Smith and an assortment of friends (like Jay Z) -- is one runaway train wreck of an ""Annie remake. Heres one ""Tomorrow when the sun never does come out.

"Annie stumbles in awkward remake review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesAnnie stumbles in awkward remake review Updated Annie starring Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhane Wallis coasts on a disturbing greed-is-good vibe and an updated yet disappointing score.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Dec. 18 2014AnnieStarring Jamie Foxx Quvenzhane Wallis Rose Byrne Cameron Diaz and Bobby Cannavale. Directed by Will Gluck. 119 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PG""What does the hard knock life mean?"" ponders Quvenzhane Wallis as the 2.0 version of the optimistic orphaned miss with a song in her heart in Will Glucks awkwardly blinged-out update of Annie.We could say its sitting through this 119-minute misguided retooling of the musical classic that once charmed Broadway and sent legions of kids for tap lessons. But that seems mean given what studio Sony has endured of late at the cyber hands of North Korean hackers.Article Continued BelowAnd in reality kids dont care what the grumpy Grinch from the Toronto Star says about a movie that coasts on a disturbing greed-is-good vibe. And one that looks strangely cheap doing it.Jamie Foxx left as Will Stacks and Quvenzhane Wallis as Annie in the remake of Annie.  (SONY/Barry Wetcher / AP)  All theyll see is a sparkly Annie where a little girl singing her heart out in Harlem plays the hero and gets to live the Manhattan high life going to a movie premiere with her pals saving a pooch (Sandy is now named for the 2012 hurricane) and becoming a social media sensation in the process.Co-produced by Jay-Z along with Will and Jada Pinkett Smith who originally had intuitive daughter Willow in the lead Wallis does an unremarkable job as her replacement. Two years beyond her Oscar-nominated turn as determined scene stealer Hushpuppy in Beasts of the Southern Wild Walliss thin singing voice has trouble cutting it. Shes cute and occasionally engaging but not always and strange camera angles occasionally dont make it clear shes actually the one singing.Musically Annie could do much better in its change of time and place from the Depression to 2014. Roosevelt is now banished to a foot-stomping opening scene in Annies history class and new songs from Sia Greg Kurstin and Gluck are forgettable.The score axes some original Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin tunes and updates others with new lyrics and bland vaguely hip-hop sameness. Witness Cameron Diazs drunken failed pop tart Miss Hannigan bellowing ""please kill me Im serious"" in the midst of ""Little Girls."" It makes us long for Carol Burnetts antics in John Hustons 1982 screen version.In this new world Annie has swapped her red dress for flowered leggings and is a foster kid rather than an orphan holding out hope the parents who left her at an Italian restaurant will come back for her.The idea of African-American casting for Annie and Daddy Warbucks (now reborn as Jamie Foxxs germaphobe billionaire cellphone king Will Stacks) feels right even if the chemistry between Annie and Stacks never gets beyond the awkward stage.Meanwhile Annie flits between positive grins and almost-bratty quips like ""luck is for suckers."" And while shes not the covetous sort we cant say that for the people around her. Take Stacks who sees befriending the little girl he saves from being squished by an SUV as a poll booster for his mayoralty aspirations.Annie bonds easily with Stackss British assistant Grace (Rose Byrne) who struggles to be heard as the films conscience. She and Stephanie Kurtzuba as a hilarious civil servant with Boris Badenov-thick Russian accent are the best things about Annie.Pity they and everybody else are drowned out by Bobby Cannavale whose frantic overacting even outstrips the excessively mugging Diaz and makes Stacks publicist Guy pretty hard to take. Annie runs about 20 minutes too long and that led to some fidgeting among the youngsters at a recent Saturday morning screening. Adults can occupy themselves by playing spot the star in cameos from Bobby Moynihan Michael J. Fox Mila Kunis Ashton Kutcher and Rihanna.And if like director Gluck Three Stooges-style spit-takes are your comic thing youll be living the high life just like Annie.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 831 p.m. EST December 18 2014Jamie Foxx left as Will Stacks and Quvenzhane Wallis as Annie in Annie.(Photo Barry Wetcher Columbia Pictures/Sony via AP)The retooled Broadway classic has been superficially updated but not at all improved.Quvenzhane Wallis is adorably plucky as the lead in Annie. She and Jamie Foxx as the newfangled Daddy Warbucks character have an appealing chemistry and their songs together are the best moments in the movie. But the rest of Annie is banal shallow and markedly cynical. ( out four; rated PG; opening Friday nationwide).USA TODAYRogen Franco discuss making The InterviewAnnie is no longer an orphan since orphanages are a thing of the past. Shes a foster child whose parents gave her up when she was 4.Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare The familiar story of Annie returns to the big screen with a new look. Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz star in the new production. VPCAs in the original she lives with the cranky Miss Hannigan(Cameron Diaz)but here Hannigan is a failed rocker embittered by her lack of stardom. She lives in Harlem and has taken in a half dozen girls as foster kids for the monthly government compensation. With her streaked blondhair she resembles a latter-day Debbie Harry but Diazs obnoxious scenery-chewing is wince-inducing making the viewer long for Carol Burnetts hilariously boozy version in the 1982 movie.USA TODAYPresident Obamas favorite movie of the year?When Annie skitters in the path of an oncoming car and is scooped up by New York City mayoral candidate and cellphone magnate Will Stacks (Foxx) the haphazard plot is set in motion.Hes a billionaire workaholic whose edges are softened by his interactions with the spunky Annie. He initially forges a bond with her in order to boost his image in political polls as instructed by his scheming consultant (Bobby Cannavale). She makes for winning photo ops. But its Annie after all so he can hardly fail to be won over by her lovably cheerful ways. In recasting Annie as a political pawn the unabashedly sentimental original has been replaced with a more cynical and materialistic reboot in a major tonal gaffe.Foxx and Wallis are the only characters with any charm.Signature tunes such as Tomorrow and Its a Hard Knock Life sound a lot like they always did but new songs have a decidedly more contemporary blandly Ramp;B sound.Mostly this feels like a star vehicle for 11-year-old Wallis whose 2012 Oscar-nominated debut in Beasts of the Southern Wild established her as a young actress to watch. Much of the movie is forgettable some even induces cringes such as during an unfortunate version of I Think Im Going to Like It Here when Stacks loyal assistant Grace (Rose Byrne) joins with a social services worker (Stephanie Kurtzuba) to awkwardly dance flail and warble around Stacks sprawling penthouse apartment. The acting is one-note and the singing save for Wallis and Foxx adds only a couple more. Director Will Gluck should have cast actors with musical backgrounds. Oddly its as if those skills werent a priority at all. Its apparent how desperately such talent is needed when a pro like Foxx sings and the audience breathes a collective sigh of relief.Brief highlights surface in the form of a movie-within-a-movie when Annie and Stacks attend a film premiere. The faux production starring Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis is directed by hot filmmaking duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller who madeThe Lego Movie.Of course the lovable little tyke wouldnt be Annie without her faithful pooch Sandy -- named this time around for the hurricane and more of an Akita mix than the shaggy terrier of past productions.The 21st century Annie drowns out the characters unflagging optimism with a disposable auto-tuned soundtrack and an off-putting blend of cynicism and schmaltz. 38 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1AM3arv",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/12/18/annie-review/19156997/,200,annie(2014)14,annie(2014),usatoday

"Review An Annie without the expected sunshine spirit or energy - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review An Annie without the expected sunshine spirit or energy Annie Barry Wetcher / Columbia Pictures Annie played by Quvenzhane Wallis gives a handmade card to Will Stacks the ""Daddy Warbucks"" in this grim depressing film version starring Jamie Foxx. Annie played by Quvenzhane Wallis gives a handmade card to Will Stacks the ""Daddy Warbucks"" in this grim depressing film version starring Jamie Foxx. (Barry Wetcher / Columbia Pictures) Betsy Sharkey The sunshine energy and vitality of Annie is missing in the new 21st century film version Hard to believe the sun will come out tomorrow for the new ""Annie.""Starring Jamie Foxx as the mogul and Quvenzhane Wallis as the moppet there are so many reasons to rain on this parade. Director Will Glucks glam grim re-imagining of the Depression-era musical about the hard-hearted rich man and the little girl who melts him is truly depressing. The setting is a bright and shiny 21st century New York City. The downer is not so much the divide between the have and have-nots although Gluck has widened it considerably. Its the dark motivations that seep into the script written by Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna based on -- but without the spirit and vitality of -- the Broadway book by Thomas Meehan music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Martin Charnin.Cynicism lurks around every corner hides behind nearly every smile and overtakes the story. Though some of Broadways ""Annie"" remains including the songs ""Tomorrow"" and ""The Hard-Knock Life"" which made the stage production a Tony-winning sensation very little about the new version feels good. And what is ""Annies"" reason for living if not to make everyone feel better and be better? Its the quintessential personal transformation story tied to an irrepressible childs smile. Even the marginally good 1980s attempt to turn the musical into a movie understood that. This politically corrupt economically super-sized ""Annie"" is badly off-key. -- Betsy Sharkey Instead this politically corrupt economically super-sized ""Annie"" is badly off-key.Stepping in for Daddy Warbucks is big-bucks Will Stacks (Foxx) a cellphone billionaire who uses a helicopter to get around Manhattan as often as a town car. Will is locked in a bitter race for mayor and hes losing -- something about his lack of humanity. Grace (Rose Byrne) is his bright beautiful second-in-command with self-esteem issues and a crush on the boss. A sleazy Guy (Bobby Cannavale) is running Wills campaign. Theirs is a win-at-any-cost strategy. Trailer Annie ""Annie"" ""Annie"" See more videos Annie lives in a Harlem foster home with a few other girls. Mrs. Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) who runs the place is as drunk and surly as ever. Shes also a sexual predator now always on the prowl. Thats the kind of ""new"" and not improved that you find in this ""Annie."" Hannigan has dirty floors mops and plenty of marching orders for her charges which give way to singing dancing and glimmers of the ghosts of Annie past.But even the musical numbers feel flat especially the new ones that seem tossed in for no reason other than to make the Billboard pop charts.With the exception of Foxx no one in the cast is much of a singer. Anyone who saw Diaz doing off-key karaoke so endearingly in ""My Best Friends Wedding"" will realize she wasnt faking it. Wallis has a sweet voice but it isnt strong which even the amped-up instrumentation cant mask. You do miss the powerhouse delivery of the little divas who are normally cast in the role -- its not merely about turning up the volume but the vibrant energy.The script pays lip service to modern problems like Annies literacy issues Wills dependence on hand sanitizers and a viral video that ties their fates together. But it all feels as contrived as the sets which are high-end but trying too hard.Before Annie is sucked into Wills world she spends her Friday nights in front of the Italian restaurant where her parents left her with a letter and half a locket. Like all the previous Annies she is a sweet-tough take-charge kid and when Wallis is allowed to be kid-like she shines.Not many other performances in the movie are worth mentioning except Stephanie Kurtzuba as Annies weary social services caseworker. The actress is the only one who seems to understand the difference between cynicism and satire.A little heart sneaks in as Will and Annie start bonding and Grace and Will start flirting. Meanwhile Guy and Mrs. Hannigan start scheming. Yet somehow the singing and dancing and relationship-building ring hollow.If you were at all a fan of the Gluck-directed ""Easy A"" the high-school teen comedy that gave Emma Stone a foothold on stardom you may wonder whats happened. ""Easy"" had a clever edge to it -- girl makes the in-crowd by spreading false rumors about her dating life -- but Gluck drew out a sweetness and some sympathy for the human condition thats gone missing in ""Annie.""Consider the reshaping of the ""find Annies parents"" fiasco. Unlike the original where the subtext driving the rush to claim the girl was hunger and hardship this gold rush is pure opportunism. From the casting call to find the proper parents to the nefarious plot to dump the girl back into the system when theyre done it allows in a level of darkness and deceit that is disturbing.As to the possibility of future appearances by the sun in ""Annies"" tomorrows -- I wouldnt bet my bottom dollar.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------AnnieMPAA rating PG for some mild language and rude humorRunning time 1 hour 52 minutesPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Reviews Musical Theater Jamie Foxx Cameron Diaz Emma Stone Annie Annie trailer Musical bets bottom dollar on Quvenzhane Wallis Selma named top film by African-American Film Critics Assn.

"Annie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; annie ) Annie (United States 2014) December 18 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Most remakes are unnecessary but Annie is a bigger offender than many. Reeking of redundancy the film not only proves incapable of overcoming the inevitable sense of dA(c)jA  vu but despite a host of cosmetic changes it fails to answer the question of why we should care about its existence. Despite being adequate family-friendly entertainment Annie proves unable to present a cogent argument why it should supplant the serviceable 1982 or 1999 versions. The movie feels like a vanity production although its difficult to determine whose ego is being stroked by this expensive adaptation. The biggest change (aside from the skin color of the two principals) is shifting Annie to 2014 from the Depression-era setting of the 1977 stage musical. The thinking is probably that kids today wouldnt care about Annie if it wasnt set in modern-day New York. (My argument is that kids today wont care about it regardless of where or when its set.) Most of the names remain the same with the notable exception of Daddy Warbucks who is now called Will Stacks (and played by Jamie Foxx). All the expected plot points are present but the details in many cases are different. Its like a familiar old house that has undergone a makeover but is still the same structure creaky floorboards and all. Some of the new dA(c)cor is decidedly garish however consider for example the lengthy car-and-helicopter chase that forms the bulk of the climax. Definitely new to this version. Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) is as she always has been - spunky and optimistic. The red hair might be gone but not the mischievous streak. Initially one of five foster children living in the cramped apartment of Ms. Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) she becomes lucky when her path crosses with that of billionaire businessman Stacks. A newbie politician hoping to unseat the incumbent as New Yorks mayor Stacks is behind in the polls but when an accidental Good Samaritan act toward Annie is caught on a cell phone camera and goes viral his number skyrocket. This leads his chief strategist Guy (Bobby Cannavale) to recommend that Stacks foster Annie. Since no one is going to deny him custody Annie moves into his palatial penthouse and the two soon form a bond. The songs are a combination of Strouse/Charnin numbers from the musical (with ""Its The Hard-Knock Life"" and ""Tomorrow"" among the seven or eight) and new tunes. The older lyrics have in some cases undergone updates. For the most part the actors are adequate singers and the musical interludes are choreographed with sufficient energy to prevent them from becoming tiresome. Annie pays homage to its history with in-jokes. The opening scene features a red-haired child named ""Annie"" and reflects back on the Depression and FDRs New Deal. Later we learn that Stacks is actually a bald man wearing a hairpiece. Director Will Gluck and his writers deserve a helping of credit in one area by focusing on the relationship between image and poll numbers they emphasize how elections are increasingly about perception over policy. This is nothing new but its unusual for a lightweight production to acknowledge such a deeply cynical truth. Of course in the service of a happy ending this is tossed away during the final few moments. On the acting front only Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx seem invested in their parts and the chemistry between them is unforced. Rose Byrne (as Stacks assistant and quasi love interest Grace) is stiff and awkward and both Bobby Cannavale and Cameron Diaz are nails-on-the-blackboard over-the-top. If the cast underwhelms it matches the production as a whole. In todays marketplace musicals are difficult to sell (just ask Clint Eastwood whose Jersey Boys was an abject failure) and something as lackluster and generic as Annie isnt likely to capture the attention of audiences when there are brighter shinier objects to dazzle.

By Maricar Estrellamestrellamom2momdfw.comPosted 736am on Wednesday Dec. 24 2014 Wednesday Dec. 24 2014 Friday Dec. 19 2014 By Maricar Estrella In the opening scene of the latest theater-to-screen adaptation of the musical Annie were introduced to the spunky ""Annie P."" who recites her history lesson of Franklin Delano Roosevelts New Deal with a Stomp-like sing-along.This modernized take of the beloved Tony Award-winning musical which was based on the popular 1920s ""Little Orphan Annie"" comic strip and subsequent radio shows captapulted many starlets to fame including Sarah Jessica Parker and Tony nominee Andrea McArdle.Phenom Quvenzhane Wallis proves her Oscar nomination for Beasts of the Southern Wild was no fluke. As a modern-day Annie Wallis shines with her sweet portrayal. However her performance alone cant save the film from being a dim adaptation.In this 2.0 version eternal-optimist Annie hasnt given up hope that her parents will return someday to claim the baby they abandoned. She constantly sneaks out of the rat-infested home of her foster mom Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) to seek out her long-lost family.In steps Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) a germaphobic telecommunications tycoon turned political candidate who gets advice from his conniving campaign manager Guy (Bobby Cannavale) that taking in a foster child would boost his poll numbers. The brunt of the movies misfortune is miscasting Diaz. She gratingly overacts nearly every scene. Sure Miss Hannigan in the stage production as well as the 1982 film version (Carol Burnett) was played as an over-the-top drunkard. But Diazs portrayal is more cartoon than comedic.Theres nothing funny about her yelling at her young wards when they sing the iconic Its the Hard Knock Life with the modernized lines ""No one cares for you a smidge/when youre a foster kid.""For the most part the movie teeters between staying true to the theater version and keeping the plot fresh with first-world problems. This works somewhat during the mash-ups of the original musical favorites such as Hard Knock Life but falters during the uninspired original songs written by Sia ( Chandalier) Greg Kurstin and director Will Gluck.In a world where Glee Pitch Perfect and The Voice co-exist you simply expect more from a film in which Jay-Z is a producer.Academy Award winner and Terrell native Jamie Foxx does an adequate job of selling Stacks as the tech-forward ""Daddy Warbucks."" Foxx is also the only one of the lead characters who can carry a tune but even he seems out of sorts with sidekicks Cannavale and Rose Byrne (as Grace).The scene in which Grace gives Annie a tour of the Stacks penthouse is disjointed and awkward mainly because of Byrnes befuddled rendition of I Think Im Gonna Like It Here and stilted (for effect?) dance moves. In the end even Annies signature rendition of Tomorrow cant wash away the sorrows of this re-telling.

By NANCY CHURNIN nchurnindallasnews.com Theater Critic Published 18 December 2014 0251 PM Updated 18 December 2014 0251 PM Related Birdman and its star Michael Keaton top Dallas-Fort Worth film critics best-of-2014 poll Action trumps personal moments in The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies (B-) The new Annie remake doesnt get everything wrong.The charismatic young Quvenzhane Wallis who earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Beasts of the Southern Wild sings a lyrical ""Tomorrow"" with a poignant mix of longing loss and optimism.This latest film update of the Tony Award-winning 1977 classic transforms the Depression-era orphan to a contemporary foster kid in a multiracial world. In the well-played opening scene a redheaded girl named Annie finishes up a school report with a tap-dancing number. Then the teacher calls on Quvenzhanes Annie and she delivers her report in an interactive style that gets the students thumping on their desks in accompaniment. Game on.Then Cameron Diaz takes the showstopping Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin song ""Little Girls"" and delivers a mutated version of its lyrics in a monotone flopping around rather than dancing as Miss Hannigan Annies selfish foster mom. Game over.Jamie Foxx plays Will Stacks a billionaire cellphone mogul running for mayor of New York. When he saves Annie from being hit by a car his poll numbers go up. His manager Guy (Bobby Cannavale) persuades him to have lunch with Annie. Annie smart-talks him into taking her in as his foster kid. Cue the story of a cute kid melting the heart of a powerful but lonely guy while also encouraging Stacks romance with his adoring assistant Grace Farrell (Rose Byrne).With the exception of ""Its the Hard Knock Life"" director Will Gluck tosses out most of the score in favor of forgettable music and lyrics by Greg Kurstin Sia Furler and Gluck. It gets worse. Most of the cast cant sing or dance and Gluck who co-wrote the screenplay has no clue why this story has endured.Plucky Orphan Annie was America in the Great Depression. When Annie saves Sandy the dog and melts the heart of Daddy Warbucks it is not about getting herself a better deal. Its about caring for the vulnerable and getting the country a better deal. Thats why theres a song about poverty ""Hoovertown"" in the original and a strong presence of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt who is inspired by Annie to come up with a way to give everyone a chance at prosperity.Given todays widening disparity between rich and poor an update on the big economic picture could have been timely. Instead this Annie talks about how lucky she personally is to get a chance for a better life and Stacks turns away from politics in favor of private giving with literacy being his charity of choice.As for the other foster kids Annie brings them occasional baubles and Miss Hannigan becomes nicer. Kudos for giving Quvenzhane a shot at this iconic character but this new version is no New Deal. Put a director at the helm who understands and loves musicals like Annie and maybe well love you tomorrow.ANNIE (C+)Directed by Will Gluck. PG (for some mild language and rude humor). 118 mins.

Comments (1) click to enlarge Annie Rated PG  118 minutes  2014 This millennial update of the 1977 Broadway musical transplants the story from the 1930s to the present and adds hip-hop beats to most of the original songs. Now Little Orphan Annie is a black foster child in Harlem (Quvenzhane Wallis (Beasts of the Southern Wild) and Daddy Warbucks is Willy Stacks (Jamie Foxx) a telecom entrepreneur with mayoral ambitions. Theres a surprising amount of bite the filmmakers openly acknowledge the similarities between the Great Depression and the present and the populist message however overstated always registers as sincere. The cast--which features Cameron Diaz and Rose Byrne--has good fun with the material though not everyone sings well. Will Gluck (Friends With Benefits) directed striking a buoyant tone that feels closer to classic Hollywood musicals than contemporary kiddie fare.

"Annie (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Annie (PG) This update of the venerable musical feels warmed-over. Share Print Save to your profile By Christine Dolen cdolenMiamiHerald.com12/18/2014 Editor rating 2 Leapin lizards Or maybe given the new Annies obsession with social media we should give the leading lady a new catchphrase. Something like Twitter twaddle The biggest difference between Annie 2014 and the 1977 Broadway smash (and the 1982 movie and 1999 made-for-TV movie) isnt that Annie and the billionaire who changes her life are played by Oscar nominee Quvenzhane Wallis (Beasts of the Southern Wild) and Oscar winner Jamie Foxx (Ray). Nor is it that the story has been doggedly updated from the Depression era to up-to-the-minute New York with even Annies canine pal Sandy getting a makeover. The problem is that hardly anyone in the cast can sing or dance on a level thats more than passable (Foxx is a fine exception). And thats a problem when the movie is a musical. Director-producer and co-screenwriter Will Gluck (Easy A Friends with Benefits) tries to set up a link at the top of the movie between the 1930s time period of the first Annie and todays rough economic times. He has Wallis give a ""performance piece"" classroom report about President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the New Deal. Its clever and you think ""Hmmm. Maybe this will be good."" No such luck. Annie and the four other girls she lives with arent orphans this time around. Theyre foster kids housed in whats supposed to be a crummy Harlem apartment rented by a generally drunk always shrill former rock backup singer named Colleen Hannigan. (And the apartment cutely set-decorated doesnt look all that bad.) Onstage and previously onscreen Miss Hannigan was a lonely kid-hating gal bedeviled by her charges. Now as portrayed by Cameron Diaz shes a shrew. David Zayas plays Lou a bodega owner whos sweet on Miss H even though shes as nasty to him as she is to the girls. Yet Zayas Lou remains enamored. Now thats acting. Every Friday night Annie sits outside an appealing Italian restaurant called Domani (translated Tomorrow the musicals signature song). Seems thats where her folks dropped her off with a note one night when they went for cannoli. Now a sympathetic waiter comes out at the end of each vigil and gives Annie a box with the sweets in it. No mom or dad but at least she gets dessert once a week. The plucky positive foster kid takes a giant leap into affluence when she crosses paths with cellphone mogul Will Stacks (Foxx). Hes running for mayor but lagging behind one Harold Gray in the polls (the name is a nod to the creator of the Little Orphan Annie comic strip). After a YouTube video of Stacks saving Annie from getting squished by a car goes viral his shady campaign advisor Guy (Bobby Cannavale) and loyal company vice president Grace (Rose Byrne) suggest Stacks become Annies foster dad -- the better to trot her out at photo ops as far as the manipulative Guy is concerned. The basic plot threads and some of the original Charles Strouse-Martin Charnin songs (including Maybe Its the Hard Knock Life and Tomorrow) have been incorporated into Glucks update with changes. Some characters have been dropped some songs cut and some lyrics altered by composer Greg Kurstin and Sia who contributed the original numbers The Citys Yours (an empowering song Stacks croons to Annie as they tour Manhattan by helicopter) and Opportunity (sung by Annie decked out in a dazzling red dress and backed by a full orchestra). Charm-wise the reconceived Annie suffers from anemia. The pretty Wallis sports a pleasant game face throughout most of the movie comes off as thoroughly self-reliant and has little obvious chemistry with Foxx. He seems preoccupied as if hes thinking about what movie he should have done instead. Cannavale is a cartoon villain and Byrne a wan leading lady. The new Annie is jam-packed with Glee-style choreography and greed-is-good luxury. Like its predecessors its a fantasy. But unlike them its not so much heartwarming as warmed-over.

Originally left by her parents as a baby with the promise that theyd be back for her someday its been a hard knock life ever since with her mean foster mom Miss Hannigan. But everythings about to change when the hard-nosed tycoon and New York mayoral candidate Will Stacks - advised by his brilliant VP Grace and his shrewd and scheming campaign advisor Guy - makes a thinly-veiled campaign move and takes her in. Stacks believes hes her guardian angel but Annies self-assured nature and bright sun-will-come-out-tomorrow outlook on life just might mean its the other way around. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In the opening scene of ""Annie"" the camera zeroes in on a little girl in redheaded curls enthusiastically reciting a report to her classmates on the death of President William Henry Harrison punctuated with a totally inappropriate tap dance. Her fellow students moan. Shes followed by another Annie a street-savvy scrapper who wins over the room with a desktop-banging chant on of all things FDRs New Deal. New Deal indeed. Its an early sign that this ""Annie"" whose producers include Will Smith and Jay Z is determined to give the 37-year-old musical a few noogies. There are references to Howard Stern George Clooney Batman and Katy Perry. Sandy the dog is named after the infamous hurricane. Annie rockets to fame through Twitter and selfies. Evil foster mom Agatha Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) tries to drink away her bitterness after being booted from Camp;C Music Factory just before an appearance on ""The Arsenio Hall Show."" The Daddy Warbucks character who goes by the name Will Stacks this time around and is played by Jamie Foxx makes his millions selling cheap cellphones and is running for mayor of New York City. But in director Will Glucks effort to be hip he forgot to hire a cast that can actually sing and dance. Barry Wetcher  Sony Pictures Jamie Foxx plays Will Stacks and Quvenzhane Wallis is ""Annie."" Theres no denying that as Annie ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" breakout star Quvenzhane Wallis has abundant charm and a heart-melting smile. But Auto-Tune and rapid-fire editing cant mask the fact that shes not a strong singer or dancer. The rest of the cast doesnt fare much better. Foxx -- who can sing -- is saddled with some new songs that should never ever be released on a soundtrack. Diaz slaughters her solos like Mario Batali in a butcher shop. Its an amusing novelty to see movie stars take a stab at a family-friendly musical but it takes more than a recognizable face to pull off elaborate numbers. Only Bobby Cannavale emerges unscathed as Stacks ruthless campaign manager making the most out of his comedic bits and tunes. Its no coincidence that Cannavale has the most stage experience with two Tony nominations. That said ""Annie"" is never excruciating. Gluck pulls off an energetic ""Its the Hard Knock Life"" that tops the underwhelming staging in John Hustons 1982 version of ""Annie."" Stephanie Kurtzuba mines laughs from her all-too-brief role as a family services representative flipping and prancing her way through a penthouse apartment in a delightful rendition of ""I Think Im Gonna Like It Here."" But those pumped-up numbers are among the few moments that will amuse youngsters -- unless your children delight in watching Foxx spit out a variety of foods. At the screening I attended kids came down with a serious case of the fidgets 90 minutes into the nearly two-hour film having more fun tearing down the aisles than paying attention to the screen. Theres still a good film to be made of ""Annie"" but itll take Broadway veterans not box-office stars to pull it off. njustinstartribune.com 612-673-7431 nealjustin View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Updated July 29 2016  853 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Go Life Buy/Sell Movie reviews Annie gets a smart update By Calvin Wilson / calvinwilsonpost-dispatch.com Calvin Wilson Dec 18 2014 (...) Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) is a little girl with such a big personality that even New York can hardly contain her. Nothing gets her down including the mean-spirited rants of her foster mom Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz). And not for a second does Annie believe that shell never be reunited with her parents who left her behind when she was a baby.Such optimism deserves a reward and it comes in the form of Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) a cellphone magnate who aspires to be mayor of the Big Apple. When his campaign adviser Guy (Bobby Cannavale) insists that taking Annie into his home would be good for his poll numbers Stacks reluctantly agrees. Before long Stacks is spending more time than he might have imagined with Annie and her new dog Sandy. Annie also bonds with Stacks business colleague Grace (Rose Byrne).But the foster kids newfound happiness is threatened when Guy joins forces with Miss Hannigan. ""Annie"" is loosely based on the classic comic strip ""Little Orphan Annie"" and the hit Broadway musical that it inspired. Its an appealing song-and-dance romp thats just right for the charismatic Wallis who earned a best actress Oscar nomination for the 2012 indie flick ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" Regardless of whats required of her -- comically dramatically or musically -- her star quality shines through.Director and co-writer Will Gluck (""Easy A"") is a bit slow to get things going but has smartly modernized Annies story. References to Twitter and Google turn up Sandy is named for the hurricane and Stacks is a stand-in for munitions tycoon Daddy Warbucks. Foxx engagingly brings off Stacks transition from full-time capitalist to surrogate dad. Diaz initially comes across as more shrill than mean but eventually settles into her role deftly balancing ditziness and desperation. And Cannavale and Byrne are perfectly cast. ""Annie"" is not a great movie musical -- but its a fun time at the movies.What ""Annie""  Three stars out of four  Rating PG  Run time 158  Content Mild language and rude humor Annie revival at the Fox stays true to the original With a movie version of the musical coming out later this month parents can show kids theres more than one way to tell a story.

For starters updating the Depression-era tale to NYC 2014 is a really dumb idea. The strain of the shoehorning is evident in every scene. Nothing wrong with making the new Annie black and proud except that Quvenzhane Wallis 11 plays her like a windup toy without an ounce of the charm and inner strength she showed in her Oscar-nominated role in 2012s Beasts of the Southern Wild.

All the songs of poverty and longing in the score by Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin are chirped with relentless cheer and given a rap beat by Sia. (I am not making this up. The singing in this movie made my ears hurt.) We even see Annie in school putting a hip-hop spin on FDR the president who figured so prominently in the hit Broadway show which became a misbegotten 1982 film directed by no less than John Huston.  That botch job looks like Singin in the Rain compared to the Auto-tuned warbling and stub-toed choreography on view in this flabby fiasco. Director Will Gluck substitutes the comic flair he brought to Easy A with the flop sweat that comes when a filmmaker knows hes in over his head and drowning. You can almost see him behind the camera shouting ""More stupid More shrill"" Everyone complies especially Cameron Diaz as Miss Hannigan the trashy child-hating caretaker at Annies foster home in Harlem. Diaz overacts the role to the point of hysteria. Its a relief to see Jamie Foxx show up as Will Stacks the cell-phone tycoon and mayoral candidate who takes Annie in and lets her see how the one-percent lives. Its not that Foxx gives a good performance its more that he doesnt shout his lines and italicize every emotion. Foxx can also sing for real something you cant say for the usually wonderful Rose Bryne as Wills assistant and Bobby Canavale as his campaign manager. The Sony hackers the so-called Guardians of Peace have leaked the new Annie online so everyone can have free access. Its their cruelest trick to date.

Photo Credit AP / Barry Wetcher advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An orphaned girl in New York City is taken in by a wealthy businessman. Rated PG. BOTTOM LINE Wallis is adorable but theres little magic in the new music or the barely-there choreography. A missed opportunity. CAST Quvenzhane Wallis Jamie Foxx Cameron Diaz LENGTH 158 The time seems right to update Annie the Depression-era orphan who began life as a newspaper comic strip in 1924 conquered Broadway in 1977 and hit the big screen in 1982s ""Annie."" Through it all redheaded Annie and her rose-colored world barely changed. Her fairy godfather Oliver Warbucks remained a benevolent zillionaire; her dog Sandy arfed at her side; the hard-knock orphans of New York City remained uniformly white. The new ""Annie"" intends to change all that beginning with its two black stars. The title role goes to Quvenzhane Wallis an 11-year-old charmer and Oscar nominee (""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") while Jamie Foxx plays a Warbucksian cellphone magnate William Stacks. Hes running for mayor of present-day New York; Sandy is named for the 2012 hurricane. The original Broadway score is augmented by new tracks from the indie-pop musicians Sia and Greg Kurstin. advertisement | advertise on newsday All these surface improvements may make Annies rags-to-riches story more recognizable to todays young viewers. The cast is lively and everyone sings well including Bobby Cannavale as Guy Stacks cynical campaign manager. Cameron Diaz replaces the legendary Carol Burnett as the mean Miss Hannigan and puts her own saucy spin on the role. Why then is ""Annie"" such an underwhelming musical? For starters it looks chintzy. The sets are static and unmoving there are few backup performers and the choreography is virtually nonexistent (the toe-tapping cops dont count). ""I Think Im Gonna Like It Here"" Annies ode to the wonders of Stacks mansion feels oddly impoverished No butlers a-leaping just Wallis bopping around on a tabletop with Rose Byrne as Grace Stacks assistant. Wallis delivers an endearing version of the Sia-Kurstin number ""Opportunity"" but overall the new songs cant match sparkling Strouse-Charnin originals like ""Tomorrow"" (here beefed up with an outdated hip-hop rhythm). Will Gluck directs ""Annie"" like one of his modestly budgeted comedies (""Friends With Benefits"" ""Easy A"") chopping scenes together with little attention to visual style or detail. (In one climactic scene a dozen extras vanish in one shot and reappear in the next.) ""Annie"" could have breathed fresh life into a beloved character. Instead the movie feels casually and even carelessly mishandled. 241 MoviesAnnie trailer Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Fans of previous incarnations are advised to check their nostalgia at the door while the uninitiated may simply check their brains. In this happier-than-happy update of the 1982 film of the popular 70s Broadway show based on the old-time comic strip everything is awesome. Everything. The streets of New York are awesome. Little girls hanging out on corners at night are awesome. Theres a little bit of every previous version present with so many other elements stirred in that the film feels like an overstuffed stew -- yet its as filling as if served in a bowl with a hole in it. Annie dreams of finding the parents who dumped her. Dont worry; she soon saves a dog and catches the eye of a rich dude running for mayor for no reason at all. She becomes a campaign prop which is also awesome. Will the two realize that sometimes ... what youre really looking for ... is right in front of you? Spoiler alert yes. As Annie Quvenzhane Wallis (""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") remains cute as a button and can sing. The Daddy Warbucks figure is no longer an aging arms dealer but handsome black mobile-phone mogul (say that three times fast) Will Stacks played by Jamie Foxx. Rose Byrne is Stacks faithful employee Grace who is destined to end up with him. The bad-and-boozy Miss Hannigan so memorably embodied by Carol Burnett in the 1982 film is Cameron Diaz here. Nine-ish songs remain from the earlier movie updated with ear-busting pseudo-hip-hop production. Some new numbers are worked in like hammers to thumbs; one (""Opportunity"") is nominated for a Golden Globe for some reason. On the plus side Foxx in particular is in fine voice. The comedy is not as sassy or sharp as fans of writer-director Will Glucks ""Easy A"" might hope. This is squarely aimed at kids however despite the C+C Music Factory jokes. The film uneasily treads a wobbly line between styles with furtive stabs at realism unearned emotion and broad comic bits. Byrne who apparently can do pretty much anything (compare her work here to ""Get Him to the Greek"" ""Neighbors"" and ""Damages"") successfully finds that balance. Others arent so lucky apparently having been written and directed into single dimensions. Perhaps the filmmakers greatest miscalculation is the depiction of Annie. None of her toughness or street-smart wiles survive reducing the character to a permanently smiling wax figure (Wallis is another Globe nominee). But who cares? This writer saw the film in the company of two members of its target demographic -- 6-year-olds -- and they enjoyed it. A lot. ""Annie"" is a shiny little pebble with nothing close to a surprise in it set in a New York that would cause Martin Scorsese to burst into flame if he walked into it. And young kids just might like it. Michael Ordona is a Los Angeles freelance writer. E-mail datebookletterssfchronicle.com Twitter michaelordona Annie Musical.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it By Stephanie Merry December 18 2014 Follow stephmerry Quvenzhane Wallis is an Annie for the modern age. She has the street smarts to navigate New York sprinting across subway platforms and pedaling down streets on a Citi Bike and the business savvy to come up with creative solutions to her financial predicaments. When she needs to get her hands on 40 fast she knows where to find it at the bodega across the street where the owner will pay the girl to doctor the dates on expiring bottles of milk and orange juice. The title character in Will Glucks funny but uneven and overlong update of the musical ""Annie"" isnt just cute and sweet -- thats not what we want in our protagonists anymore. Shes cute and sweet and scrappy and droll. John Hustons 1982 version and the musical it was based on took place during the Great Depression and while elements of that movie are undoubtedly dated this new rendition of ""Annie"" could feel even more antiquated and sooner with its Auto-Tuned songs references to memes depictions of flashy technology and jokes about cellphone companies spying on customers. The most basic outline of the plot remains the same. Annie lives in a foster home with a handful of other girls under the supervision of the mean-spirited boozehound Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz turning in a performance that feels thoroughly false). Annies path crosses coincidentally with that of Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) a mayoral candidate Purell obsessive and self-made billionaire. In an effort to soften his prickly image Will takes in Annie. And the girl smooth operator that she is repays him by mugging adorably for the paparazzi. Eleven-year-old Wallis scored an Academy Award nomination in 2012 for her role in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" and she has no trouble carrying her speaking scenes. But the musical interludes are more problematic; she and many of the other actors sound digitally processed. The only performer who doesnt sound like he had his pitch perfected is Foxx who has an amazing voice but looks so serious and impassioned during his big solo he appears to be starring in an Ramp;B video. The pop star Sia and producer Greg Kurstin contributed to the soundtrack reworking the original songs and penning new tracks including the Golden Globe-nominated ""Opportunity"" sung by Wallis. Some of the updates are better than others. ""Its the Hard-Knock Life"" is a fun track sung by the foster kids who use the sounds of banging mops and stomping feet as instruments. But the attempt to turn ""Youre Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" into a dance song is a misfire that doesnt work in the movie and wont fare better at a club. ""Annie"" can feel a bit edgy for a kids movie. When one of the girls asks what ""hard-knock life"" means an older roommate glibly tells her ""it means our life sucks."" But more problematically its too long for a kids movie. A couple of the songs could easily be cut and some of that time would have been better spent focusing on the relationship between Annie and Will whose bond at times comes across as artificial. There are some very funny moments in the movie even for grown-ups including a video of Will that goes viral. The absurd machinations of Wills smarmy political adviser are also good for a laugh. But ultimately ""Annie"" is so fixated on being current that it will never be more than a passing fancy.   PG. At area theaters.

"Annie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Annie Annie Barry Wetcher Columbia Pictures Scene from Annie."" Scene from Annie."" (Barry Wetcher Columbia Pictures) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune stead of treated we get tricked Those interested in the health and well-being of the screen musical are advised to wait a week for ""Into the Woods"" rather than take a flier on the wobbly unsatisfying new update of ""Annie.""It brings no pleasure to report this especially when the distributing studio Sony is dealing with a monstrous hacking scandal and a hard-knock year. Lets put it charitably. The risks taken by co-writer and director Will Gluck (""Easy A"" ""Friends With Benefits"" both quite good) begin with pulling ""Annie"" out of the 1930s and plopping it down in contemporary Manhattan. Living in foster care up in Harlem the girl formerly known as ""orphan"" (each time shes called that she corrects the record by retorting ""Im a foster kid"") is played this time by the confidence-plus machine called Quvenzhane Wallis of ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" Miss Hannigan her boozy tormentor has been re-conceived as a wannabe rock star spewing jokes about Hootie and the Blowfish. Shes played by Cameron Diaz scaling her shtick for multiplexes equipped with a second balcony of which there are none. Daddy Warbucks has become Will Stacks a germaphobic socially isolated communications magnate portrayed by Jamie Foxx. Running for mayor Stacks rescues Annie in traffic one day and suddenly his poll numbers improve. Egged on by his campaign manager (the Rooster Hannigan equivalent for those keeping track) Stacks acts as Annies rich uncle-type guardian for short-term publicity purposes. Bobby Cannavale plays the campaign string-puller; Rose Byrne a ray of sunshine in a pretty grim movie is Stacks Woman Friday whose life cries out for some merry disruption.This is what the re-makers of ""Annie"" had in mind from the beginning. The script by Gluck and Aline Brosh McKenna establishes a jeering tone with a prologue set at Annies school in which a tap-dancing red-headed moppet -- the Annie from the Tribune Content Agencys fabled comic strip -- is mocked by classmates. A lot of screen time in this new ""Annie"" is devoted to exploiting the pernicious yet convenient range of Stacks cellphone empire; the guy even has a cellphone tower hidden in the Statue of Libertys torch. Is he a Bond villain in training? Now and then theres a bit of the original score the one written by ace composer Charles Strouse and banal lyricist Martin Charnin though often in ""Annie"" you get a bit of an old song jammed inside new melodies and lyrics supplied by Greg Kurstin Sia Furler and Gluck. I dont care about fidelity to the original but I do care that the new ""Annie"" mistakes dithering for choreography and cynicism for wised-up charm. Is this story really the place for lines such as ""People shouldnt be scared of governments; they should be scared of cellphone companies""? Huh? Wha? The overall vibe of this folly is curdled and utterly blase; its a 118-minute foregone conclusion finesse-free and perilously low on the simple performance pleasures we look for in any musical of any period. I did enjoy Wallis and Byrne together though. And Im sure Purell is enjoying the product placement. Annie Barry Wetcher Columbia Pictures Rose Byrne and Quvenzhane Wallis in ""Annie.""

Credit Barry Wetcher 2 stars out of 4 Maybe its the cheery soundtrack or that iconic red dress. Or maybe its just ""Maybe."" But bet your bottom dollar that girls of all ages have a special connection with the movie-musical about an orphaned girl and the man who makes her dreams come true. The 2014 remake of 1982s Annie originally based on the classic Broadway musical fails to honor that special connection. Co-producers Will Smith and Jay Z shook it up and turned it into a slick out-of-tune miss thats desperately aching to be hip. PHOTOS Holiday movies 2014 preview Barry Wetcher Gone is the Depression-era Annie with an appearance from the Radio City Music Hall Rockettes. In comes Twitter-era Annie and an appearance from... Rihanna? Yup were in 2014 now and our little girl (Oscar nominee Quvenzhane Wallis) is living in a Harlem foster home waiting for her parents to come fetch her. Running the joint is floozy Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) who has a tragic backstory herself She used to be a backup singer for C amp; C Music Factory. Things that make you go hmmm... indeed. PHOTOS Holiday movie stars then and now One sunny day Annie is walking on the street when smooth-talking cell-phone magnate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) saves her from being hit by a truck. (Annoying Annie doesnt even thank him before she runs off.) After the clip of the accident goes viral Wills right-hand man (Bobby Cannavale) advises his client to let Annie move in to his amazing penthouse apartment. Annie needs a home and besides its good PR for Wills mayoral campaign. At first Annie is wise to Wills agenda and snaps at him during the photo opps. And Will would rather banter with his beautiful assistant Grace (Rose Byrne). The two soon begin to bond of course. Especially when Will takes Annie on a helicopter tour of NYC and then invites her foster-kid pals to a red-carpet movie premiere. Barry Wetcher A little singing and dancing works wonders for the pair too. But this is where the reboot errs in the most cringe-worthy of ways. The favorites have held up for decades and yet all of them save for the still-dazzling ""Its the Hard Knock Life"" are given forgettable new melodies and lyrics. Few parents will recognize Wallis and Byrnes auto-tuned rendition of ""I Think Im Going to Like it Here"" -- and fewer kids will be able to hum it on the way home Frozen-style. Diaz and Cannavales clumsy off-key duet of ""Easy Street"" in a lounge is even more of a face-palmer. And because the filmmakers are striving for a cool quotient -- or maybe just feel the need to acknowledge the awfulness -- some of the performances are openly mocked. (Near the end of the film for instance someone snipes that Wills political aspirations might be kaput if hes going to continue to break out into song). The result is a lack of shamelessly big production number moments. PHOTOS Youngest Oscar nominees Its not like Hugh Jackman is belting out these babies either. Fact is that Diaz Foxx Byrne and even the winsome Wallis have such average pipes that none of them would make it past the blind auditions on The Voice. (Diaz is a talented comedienne but lest we forget that her musical chops served as a punchline in My Best Friends Wedding.) And though Grammy nominated Sia helped composed the new material and pops up in a cameo she might want to erase this from her IMDB credits. PHOTOS Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale Look the 1982 film has its flaws -- the vaguely racist Punjab character and Annies scary near-death experience on train tracks among them. But it did boast a wholesome timeless charm. Those qualities have been stripped away here and replaced with peculiar pop culture references (will 8-year-olds really understand Baba Booey Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Arsenio Hall Show gags?) and superfluous plots twists (Annie.... cant.... read). By the time Wallis and Foxx launch into the tap-dancing finale kids might be too restless from that two-hour running time to smile. And keep in mind that youre never fully dressed without one. But hey at least the dog is still cute.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Quvenzhane Wallis performance in Annie should effectively silence people who grumbled at the casting of a black child in a role traditionally performed by redheaded white girls. At 11 Wallis is superhumanly adorable in the title role and her dogged optimism and energetic charm compensate for the weaknesses in her vocal performance. Hating Wallis is like hating ice cream on a summers afternoon and its a good thing that little girls of many colors can find some version of themselves in the multiracial cast of this musical reboot. But Broadway purists determined to hate Annie need not fear because theres plenty worth complaining about. The adult cast is agreeable at best. Any scene without Wallis and her gang of remarkably symmetrical well-groomed orphans feels like a chore--""Lets just get through this"" the movie seems to be saying ""Then well show you that cute little girl and her puppy again."" Jamie Foxx apparently savvy enough to realize this isnt about him wisely dials it back as cell phone magnate Will Stacks. Rose Byrne is tender if anemic as Grace the Pepper Potts to Foxxs Tony Stark. The villains dont fare as well and Bobby Cannavale seems faintly embarrassed by his performance as a new character scheming campaign manager Guy. But the real humiliation is reserved for Cameron Diaz as Miss Hannigan re-imagined here as a shrill washed-up backup singer for C + C Music Factory. Diaz seems to have been working with a different director than everyone else one who kept yelling ""More more"" as she stumbled around the IKEA-furnished apartment we are supposed to believe is the nadir of urban poverty in--gasp--Harlem. In between is standout supporting player Stephanie Kurtzuba as a Russian-accented social worker who provides a few good laughs.One big change from the musical is the way that Annie and Stacks cross paths Rather than Grace showing up at Annies door in search of an orphan to come over for Christmas the two meet coincidentally when Stacks saves Annie from being hit by a van. Stacks is polling poorly in the New York mayoral race when this happens and Guy convinces him that a photo op with the girl which eventually turns into her moving into his penthouse will be great PR for his campaign. This cynical plotline is just one of the changes meant to make Annie more contemporary like turning the title character into a foster child instead of an orphan presumably because orphanages are going out of style. Then there are the obligatory social-media references (this Annie is a Twitter celebrity) slang (""throwing shade"" is used) and hip-hop beats. Actually the last one makes the most sense considering Jay Z is one of the movies producers although it does raise the question of whether this whole production was based on the fact that Jay sampled ""Hard Knock Life"" back in 1998 (and yes this Annie does put the beat behind it). A nod to Stomp a subplot about the educational system failing our plucky young heroine and a scene positing that location tracking on cell phones is fine because it can be used to find lost children complete Annies attempts at 21st-century relevancy. The treatment of Stacks self-made billionaire status is especially troublesome removing the Great Depression elements of the musical while enthusiastically preaching capitalist meritocracy. Annie spends a significant amount of time focusing on the couches and swimming pools and high-tech gadgets in Stacks penthouse every surface polished to a gleaming very expensive-looking shine. But as the movie reminds us over and over its okay that hes so rich because he earned it through hard work. (Cannavale and Diaz on the other hand are looking for an easy way out.) At one point Annie accompanies Stacks as he makes sure all his cell phone towers are working which is somehow accomplished by flying over them in a helicopter. Soaring over Manhattan in a symbol of Stacks capitalist empire Annie asks how he became so wealthy. ""I worked very very hard"" he tells her.It shouldnt be much of a spoiler to say that love triumphs over material ambition at the end of Annie. But rather than forcing Stacks to make any real sacrifices learning this lesson the movie rewards him with people who love him for who he really is and a massive fortune. ""Sorry youre poor but you just didnt want it enough"" the movie says. ""Maybe if you work harder you can be rich and loved. Here have a smartphone.""

It was a period piece about the Great Depression -- both a hooray for Warbucksian success and an elbow-jab making clear that rich folks need to share -- with a detour into a Hooverville and a key cameo from Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Even in 1977 you can imagine restless kids in the theater kicking their seats and loudly whispering ""Whos that guy?"" A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Every version since has gotten younger and younger. John Hustons 1982 movie cut the child-confounding songs ""Wed Like to Thank You Herbert Hoover"" and ""New Deal for Christmas"" and added two ditties about Annies dog. And this new flick scraps the 1933 setting altogether and plops Annie into modern-day Harlem a bodega playground updating the lyrics with references todays children can understand -- at least todays children with subscriptions to Teen Vogue. Now in ""Youre Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" your clothes arent ""Beau Brummell-y"" but ""Chanel Gucci.""Producers Jay-Z Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith must have beamed when they discovered that rhyme -- and to be fair their three children are fashion-forward. (Two-year-old Blue Ivy recently was spotted in a black leather jacket which style blogs sniffed she copied from Kim Kardashians baby North West.) Theres a sense that neither they nor director Will Gluck know what normal kids -- the kind they need to buy tickets to Annie -- think is cool. Instead once again this is an Annie for adults only now the spin is less ""Remember the social-welfare lessons of the Great Depression?"" and more ""Hey rich people are nice too.""Film Details Annie RatingPG GenreComedy Running Time118 min. More Info Trailer Fittingly the filmmakers have given evil orphan wrangler Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) what to them must be the ultimate pathetic backstory Shes a wannabe pop star fired from C+C Music Factory who couldnt even hack it as one of Hooties Blowfish. (So embarrassing.) Diaz suffers through a part that makes her wear sparkly scarves and a scowl -- shes bitter not scary. Whats surprising isnt that her Hannigan is scraping by fostering orphan girls at 157 a week each -- its that she hasnt forced them into singing servitude by trotting them out for Americas Got Talent.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm This Annie is so modern that the girls benefactor Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) is a telecommunications baron running for mayor. It presumes that children care a great deal about cellphone towers political campaigns and Twitter. When Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) first enters Stacks home he and his assistants (Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale) spend the scene tapping on their smartphones which seems less like a statement about disconnection and more like a casual acceptance that this is The Way Adults Are Now. And instead of being impressed by a gilded mansion crammed with a hundred servants shes dazzled by a cold modernist penthouse with merely a ""smart wall"" that responds to her voice. Is she an abandoned 10-year-old looking for a forever home or a party planner?The 2014 Annie doesnt trust the universal yearning in the songs to carry the film. Instead it glosses the old standards with drumline stomps and Beyonce-style backbeats cranked up so loud you can barely hear the words in ""Tomorrow."" The new songs all have that generic anthemic awe that sells luxury cars and headphones and the millennial assurance that anything is possible if you believe in yourself. Still theyre good in the loosest definition of the word -- Foxx can make every chorus sound great even if his Ramp;B falsetto couldnt sound stranger spilling out of a germaphobic billionaire.The only thing Foxxs Stacks has in common with Daddy Warbucks is that both men are rich and bald. (Though Stacks secretly wears a wig.) Hes so unintimidating that Annies first words to him are ""Slow your roll."" But at least he fares better than Sandy the dog who pants in the background as though the screenwriters knew there had to be an animal but for the life of them couldnt remember why.Wallis is a strong screen presence. Her gift as a child star is that she genuinely doesnt seem to care what grown-ups think. Unlike Huston with the original films Annie Aileen Quinn a stage-trained charmer who dutifully tap-danced through the film director Gluck seems to have decided the best way to use Wallis is simply to let her do whatever she wants. Shes raw charismatic alive and unpredictable In her biggest solo number every time Gluck cuts to Annie singing on a stage its a crapshoot whether shell be preening like Billie Holiday or rocking jerkily side to side like Chuck E. Cheese. In short shes a child. The question is if this musical has any genuine interest in one.ANNIE | Directed by Will Gluck | Written by Emma Thompson Aline Brosh McKenna and Gluck | Columbia Pictures | Citywide Old Irrelevant Comedians Whine About Censorship in Can We Take a Joke?

Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz star in the new production. VPC Kerry Lengel The Republic | azcentral.com 415 p.m. MST December 17 2014Quvenzhane Wallis brings a natural charm to the latest adaptation of the 1977 Broadway musical. While tween girls are likely to enjoy the sing-along update parents will likely find it predictable.Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx star in ""Annie.""(Photo Barry Wetcher/Columbia Pictures/AP)Story Highlights3 stars (out of 5)Quvenzhane Wallis handles her vocals pretty well and her winning smile and sassy persona propel the film.Quvenzhane Wallis was the youngest best-actress nominee in Oscar history for her fierce portrayal of a semi-feral bayou child in 2012s ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" Now all of 11 the talented youngster brings her natural charisma to the title role of ""Annie.""An update of the 1977 Broadway musical this ""Annie 2.0"" moves the story from the Great Depression to present-day New York where the irrepressible orphan lives with four other girls and a cartoonishly alcoholic foster mom played by Cameron Diaz. Scrubbing floors while jauntily singing ""Its the Hard-Knock Life"" she dreams of being reunited with her parents. But a chance encounter with a cellphone mogul named Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) offers her a fresh chance of finding a happy home.Featuring bright horn-heavy arrangements of such familiar tunes as ""Tomorrow"" along with a few new numbers the up-to-the-minute plot involves social media and political chicanery with the always-welcome Bobby Cannavale (""Boardwalk Empire"") spicing things up as a sleazy campaign operative who will do anything to get his billionaire boss elected mayor of New York.The feel-good story and sing-along production numbers are likely to please the movies target audience of tween girls but theres not a whole lot in ""Annie"" to win their parents over. The best thing about the movie is Foxx who sings beautifully (with or without Auto-Tune) and brings an easy charm to his role as a hard-charging entrepreneur in sore need of a reminder about Whats Really Important in Life.Somewhat less watchable is Diaz as Colleen Hannigan a trampy boozer still bitter about missing her shot at stardom in the music biz (she was fired as a backup singer for one-hit wonder C+C Music Factory). And a pair of romantic subplots -- one involving Stacks Type A personal assistant (Rose Byrne) -- are perfunctory at best cheesy at worst.But of course ""Annie"" -- which dates to the 1924 launch of the newspaper comic ""Little Orphan Annie"" -- has never been the most sophisticated of childrens stories. The latest version is formulaic and predictable but it has its charms not the least of which is Wallis easy smile and sassy screen presence. And shes not a bad little singer either even if shes not quite ready for her ""American Idol"" audition.For Wallis as for Annie ""Tomorrow"" looks bright.Annie3 stars (out of 5) Director Will Gluck.Cast Quvenzhane Wallis Jamie Foxx Cameron Diaz.Rating PG for some mild language and rude humor.Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896. 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/16u46YW More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

Rebooted update on the classic musical. Director Will Gluck (158). PG Mild language crude humor. Area theaters. Every parent of school-aged children will hit a day over the next three weeks when they want to throw in the towel. Thats when this uneven ""Annie"" reboot starring Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhane Wallis will come in handy. Kids will enjoy it and adults desperate for a new activity will endure it. In 1982 critics savaged John Hustons attempt to bring this adored musical to the big screen. But children loved it because as this intermittently misguided effort proves its impossible to ruin the allure of great tunes plucky kids and heartfelt fantasies. Director Will Gluck (""Easy A"") and co-screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (""27 Dresses"") have made some smart updates like turning Annie from wide-eyed Depression-era orphan into a savvy foster kid. Its also nice to see their multicultural cast given that too many family films are still so lacking in diversity. Stacks (Jamie Foxx) and Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) spend some time together in ""Annie."" (Barry Wetcher) Our heroine (Wallis a 2013 Oscar nominee for ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") lives in Harlem with mean Ms. Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) who makes her money boarding foster girls. Fortunately Annie gets a guardian upgrade when she meets mayoral candidate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx). Stacks is a Bloomberg-style mogul who needs a campaign push so his aides (Bobby Cannavale Rose Byrne) initially suggest a few photo ops with the adorable Annie. Despite Stacks initial cynicism and the efforts of some meddling troublemakers they soon start to feel like a full-fledged family. For all the talent involved the overall effect is surprisingly flat. Foxx appears disconnected Byrne is wasted and a painfully hammy Diaz seems to be in another movie altogether. Cameron Diaz and Quvenzhane Wallis in the film update of ""Annie."" (Barry Wetcher) The awkward choreography is also disappointing. But the strangest mistake is the music which has been blandly retooled for a new generation. Surely a film produced by Jay Z and Will Smith could have offered better updates on songs like ""Its the Hard Knock Life."" Even so Wallis is charming and charismatic enough to carry the movie with confidence. And though this effort falls short its always worth updating classic stories for contemporary audiences. Anyone with high standards will have to compromise them. But thats easy enough when youve got bored kids and winter break stretching out ahead of you. ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Apparently in big bad 2014 cheerfulness has no currency. Cut to our new Annie played sincerely--if a bit stiffly--by former Oscar nominee Quvenzhane Wallis who won our hearts with her wide-eyed naturalism in 2012?s Beasts of the Southern Wild. She gets up in front of those same classmates and wows them with a hip-hop-styled discourse on the New Deal. Shes a streetwise 10-year-old moppet with the smarts to snag extra time on a NYC Citibike but not savvy enough to look both ways before crossing the street. After narrowly escaping being hit by a car shes rescued by cell phone magnate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx game but looking vaguely embarrassed). Hes running for mayor with the help of his kind lonely assistant (Rose Byrne) and his over-caffeinated aide (Bobby Cannavale). Once Annie escapes the clutches of her boozy tarty caretaker at the orphanage Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz in her third overly strident comic role this year) she quickly finds that rich people live pretty sweet lives what with their digital animal wallpaper and movie premieres. (Speaking of which the intentionally over-the-top-ridiculous film-within-a-film starring Ashton Kutcher Mila Kunis and Rihanna looks way more fun than the main attraction.) And so the once-heartwarming story of an orphan girl who craves the comfort of a real family is now a smash-cut commercial for the one percent with lots of head-smackingly unsubtle product placement that never lets us forget how crassly commercially the whole enterprise is. Musically Annie is a disaster. The melodious original score by Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin gets the full-on Autotune pap treatment which takes to these songs about as well as a lute to death metal. You wont ever hear a worse rendition of ""Easy Street"" than the one performed by Diaz and Cannivale--I promise. (The Sia-branded new songs feel much more at home.) One can only hope that Byrne Diaz and Cannavale had ""movie musical"" on their bucket lists and will never tarnish their talents in such a way again. Aside from an unintentional homage to Zoolander that is so tone-deaf itll make you guffaw Annie goes out of its way to make viewing it a hard-knock life...for us.

Although the film might have been a fun holiday diversion its admirably revisionist spirit is undermined by the same proto-Randian contempt for the poor that first defined the story of Americas most optimistic orphan when she was introduced in a 1924 comic strip. Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) is now a plucky Manhattan foster child who after a chance encounter becomes the live-in ward of an antisocial billionaire (Jamie Foxx terrific as mayoral candidate Will Stacks). At first Stacks is literally allergic to poor people--hes ""germophobic""--but after singing a few songs with Annie he learns that the 99 percent might be human after all. At the very least they can be domesticated especially when in the service of a political campaign. As a character Annie has always reflected the sense of hope that greases the wheels of capitalism. But Walliss pathologically upbeat Annie is so divorced from reality that her saga doesnt inspire optimism so much as it parodies upward mobility. Although the young actor delivers the same rambunctious moxie that defined her performance in Beasts of the Southern Wild her characters robotic contentedness makes it hard to tell if she is bullish or brainwashed. The default shrillness of the musicals familiar numbers doesnt help but at least the lower register of the films Ramp;B-inflected new songs gives Wallis the chance to prove that her talent is real just misapplied. Meanwhile Cameron Diazs performance as the evil Ms. Hannigan is so big it can probably be seen from space. Perhaps the most hypercurrent thing about Glucks film is how it espouses the value of family while actually celebrating products as the only true form of modern connection Annies friends get cell phones instead of parents Stackss swanky high tech penthouse is a veritable Sony showroom and Instagram literally saves Annie from being kidnapped. Its the brilliant corporate spoof of 2001s logo-saturated Josie and the Pussycats without the subversive irony. Annie deserves credit for illustrating that old racial prejudices dont have to be preserved by new entertainments but this remixed rendition doesnt speak to the kids of today so much as it does to their parents wallets. No wonder its being released just in time for Christmas.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 285892861 ""Annie"" is a hard knock no fun adaptation of a musical classic By LINDSEY BAHR Associated Press December 15 2014 -- 658pm Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Its impossible to talk about ""Annie"" without admitting up front when you first experienced John Hustons 1982 film. For adults at the time it was a spectacular disaster thanks in large part to the bizarre direction of Huston. For kids one of whom was me it might as well be up there with ""The Sound of Music"" as a musical classic. This is why kids dont write movie reviews but it also helps to remind that sometimes it wont even occur to them that the movie theyre watching is bad. In that way perhaps this new version of ""Annie"" is the update we all deserve a flawed movie that kids will inexplicably take to. But with such a wealth of innovative and heartfelt family fare in both the animated and live-action realms why bother? The best that can be said of this new version is that Will Gluck and company have certainly made the story and most of the songs their own. But aside from originality points this new ""Annie"" is a charmless and grossly materialistic bore especially for now-adults of a certain age who still hold the 82 version in high regard. ""Annie"" has always been a strange beast with its grand New Deal politics juxtaposed with the tale of a rich savoir taking in a plucky orphan. Here Annie (Quvenzhane Wallis) is a foster kid living with a handful of pre-teen girls under the lazy supervision of Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) in her Harlem apartment. Diaz channeling an early Christina Aguilera with her cheap hoop earrings and messily crimped hair talk-yells at the girls with such an unnatural shrill that it fails at being cruel comedic or drunken. This is no Carol Burnett slapstick. But nothing actually seems that bad for Annie. She and her foster friends are all clothed and fed and attending clean friendly schools. They even seem to mostly like Hannigan except when she makes them clean. A hard knock life indeed. This is not the dire hopeless situation of a blighted Depression-era orphanage. Still Annie wants out and is determined to find the parents she believes exist. Fine fair. On one of her many solo jaunts she runs into billionaire Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) an affectless Bloombergian cellphone titan in the midst of a mayoral campaign. In Annie his team (Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale) sees an opportunity to make the disconnected mogul more relatable to the common voter. All they need is a few press-friendly moments with the cute foster kid from the wrong side of the tracks. We all know the story by now. What starts as a tactic turns real as Stacks realizes he can care for another being. Its how they get there thats the problem. Gluck who made the delightful self-aware teen comedy ""Easy A"" proves inept at staging and filming the movies musical numbers. There is hardly any choreography to speak of -- in one number Byrne just sways back and forth as the camera flies overhead grandiosely as though this was a Busby Berkeley setup -- and the singing across the board is on-key mediocrity even though the auto tuning does its best to obscure everyones natural sound. Wallis who displayed preternatural talent and strength at the tender age of five in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" has been directed to play 11-year-old Annie as a self-assured brat. She is unfazed by authority figures and is the type of kid who will just take the stage at a swanky charity event and burst into song. In this version Annie also becomes a social media celebrity. She and Foxx share a few sweet moments but their connection mostly comes across as superficial -- as does nearly everything in this movie. This ""Annie"" was supposed to be for a new generation. In the harsh light of 2014 its never looked so dated. ""Annie"" a Sony release is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association of America ""for some mild language and rude humor.""

TWITTER Quvenzhane Wallis and Jamie Foxx play 21st century incarnations of the comic-strip orphan and her billionaire benefactor in this musical update Come back John Huston all is forgiven. When the grizzled Hollywood veteran was attached to direct the 1982 film version of Broadways mammoth hit Annie which had fetched a record sum for screen rights much collective head-scratching ensued. Nothing in Hustons output indicated an affinity for family-friendly movie musicals. Pundits were no less mystified once they saw the film which suggested an agonized disconnect between director and material. Yet audiences who were kids back then regard it as a classic playing fast and loose with that term. Maybe todays tweens will feel similar affection for this misconceived contemporary update but they neednt be encouraged. The overwhelming impression from this very loose remake -- directed with a stunning lack of musicality by Will Gluck (Easy A Friends With Benefits) who co-wrote the witless screenplay with Aline Brosh McKenna (The Devil Wears Prada) -- is that the creative team doesnt actually like the material much. If not for gushing testaments in the press notes you might be tempted to think theyre embarrassed by it. All but a handful of the existing songs have been shredded often retaining just a signature line or two and drowning it in desperately hip polyrhythmic sounds aurally assaultive arrangements and inane new lyrics. The original songs by Sia Greg Kurstin and Gluck are forgettable synthetic riffs that recall those boring filler tracks you skipped over on old Justin Timberlake albums. Considering that among the films producers is Jay Z whose 1998 sampling of ""Its the Hard-Knock Life"" was an epic encounter in pop-culture history this bland Ramp;B/hip-hop Muzak is a disappointment. Read more Annie Cast Shakes Off Sony Hack ""Im a Lot More Heartbroken About Other Things"" Every ounce of charm has been pulverized out of the musical in a strained effort to drag it into the social-media age. Whats even sadder is that the same could be said for the films young star Quvenzhane Wallis who brought heroic authenticity to her role in Beasts of the Southern Wild creating a lyrical poster child for the marginalized poor. Here shes reduced to one-note processed pluckiness as if shes been cloned from those overconfident children of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith; the latter couple optioned the material and are also producers. Putting aside the grating performances the clumsy direction the visual ugliness and the haphazard development of story character and relationships the movie is hobbled by its intrinsic unsuitability for contemporary retelling. Popularized in the 1920s and 30s in the Little Orphan Annie syndicated comic strip the Depression-era Cinderella story follows the adventures of a ginger-haired moppet her dog Sandy and Oliver ""Daddy"" Warbucks the billionaire tycoon who takes her under his benevolent wing. In the musical not only does Annie transform Warbucks from a gruff capitalist into a humanitarian softie her eternal optimism also enchants FDR and his jaded cabinet inspiring the New Deal. The pieces simply dont fit together in the present day. Read more Annie Director Will Gluck Worried Hed ""Ruin a Lot of Kids Childhoods"" The main carryover along with Annie and her foster-kid pals is the Warbucks figure renamed Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx). Hes a germophobic telecommunications giant who maintains his monopoly by hiding cellphone towers in landmarks like the Statue of Liberty. Aided by his trusted vp Grace (Rose Byrne) and oily campaign manager Guy (Bobby Cannavale) Stacks is running for mayor of New York City to gain the political traction necessary to grow his empire. Basically hes Michael Bloomberg in tech instead of financial media though the arc of the characters humanization is barely coherent. A chance collision on the street with Annie and a resulting YouTube video give Guy the brain wave to fix Stacks likability problems via strategic photo opportunities with the spunky tyke. A lunch turns into an invitation to stay at Stacks vast apartment -- a coldly ultramodern computerized penthouse that looks as inviting as a dental clinic even with those views. Naturally Annie warms Stacks chilly heart opening his eyes to the corruption of big business and politics and the superior values of love and family. He redeems himself by funding a center for child literacy which is just like the end of Zoolander except its neither fun nor entertaining. This movies notions of joy are aggressively fabricated nowhere more so than when Grace gives Annie a whirlwind tour of the skypad singing a butchered version of ""I Think Im Gonna Like It Here."" Choreographer Zach Woodlees moves mostly involve running and flailing all over the place with no rhythm while (presumably for comic relief) an ingratiating Russian city employee (Stephanie Kurtzuba) galumphs around getting in the way -- much like cinematographer Michael Gradys lurching cameras. Watch more Final Annie Trailer Has Billionaire Jamie Foxx Competing With Absent Parents If theres a more awkward musical number ever committed to film I cant recall it right now. Oh wait there is one later with the big finale ""I Dont Need Anything But You"" in which Wallis Foxx and Byrne get to -- gulp -- dance while everyone else stands and sways wearing frozen smiles. These scenes make you wonder if Gluck has ever seen a movie musical. One of the few memorable elements of Hustons movie was Carol Burnetts boozy comic caricature as child-hating orphanage den mother Miss Hannigan. Here we get Cameron Diaz who mistakes strident and obnoxious for funny giving Cannavale some competition for broadest shtick. The character takes in foster kids at her Harlem apartment to get a monthly handout from the city drowning the sorrows of her failed music career (she was kicked out of C+C Music Factory before the groups breakthrough) and hurling herself at any man within range except the one who inexplicably wants her (David Zayas). Her bowdlerized ""Little Girls"" is a low point. The subplot from the original in which Miss Hannigan schemes to pass off impostors as the birth parents who abandoned Annie survives. However like most of Glucks chaotic storytelling its handled sloppily careening into a suspense-free helicopter chase during which Annie is tracked via social media. The films pandering load of 21st century concessions is tiresome indeed reaching its nadir when OMG Katy Perry tweets about Annie Watch more Saturday Night Live Cameron Diaz Mocks Annie The biggest hole in the movie is the poignancy thats missing from the by-the-numbers process of Annie Stacks and Grace becoming a family. Even Annies regular Friday-night pilgrimages to the restaurant Domani (Italian for ""Tomorrow"" geddit?) where her parents promised to return is more cloying than affecting since Wallis conveys so little emotion. That same lack of vulnerability applies to all the foster kids even in the guaranteed heartstring-tugger ""Maybe."" When an orphan advocates ""Save your dreams for good stuff like shopping with an unlimited credit card"" the film seems to be pushing materialistic desire over any yearning for family. Of the cast Foxx escapes most unscathed despite having to do more spit-takes than Danny Thomas. Hes also the only one of the principals who can actually sing though on his solo ""The Citys Yours"" (a distinctly minor addition to the canon of Big Apple anthems) he goes for an embarrassing sexy-soul-daddy sound thats out of character. Even in a movie Auto-Tuned to within an inch of its life Wallis clearly is no singer. And Byrne who can usually be relied upon to add some sparkle is as wan here as her feeble vocals. The movie opens with a carrot-topped school classmate of Annies who shares the same name and is cut from the characters traditional cloth. (Shes played by Taylor Richardson an alternate in the lead role in the recent Broadway revival.) Its one of a number of winking meta-references to the original musical along with a sight gag nodding to Warbucks bald dome. But its a telling statement that the playout song on the end credits is ""Moonquake Lake"" a disposable pop theme to a movie whose premiere Annie amp; Co. attend. (It features Ashton Kutcher Mila Kunis and Rihanna with other gratuitous celebrity cameos elsewhere.) The song has absolutely nothing to do with Annies story which feeds the confusion as to why the filmmakers even bothered with the source material. Not to pour salt on Sonys unfortunate hack-attack wounds but if Annie was less downloaded than other releases illegally leaked online it might be because audiences are not stupid and caught a whiff of what was in store.

Try sitting through the new ""Annie."" A rewritten re-orchestrated but far from revitalized version of the old Broadway musical this latest edition moves it out of the Depression and into a modern tech-driven New York. Thats a big change but not necessarily a bad one. Since the script starts off in a classroom with Annie summing up the idea of the New Deal as ""work hard and get rich"" perhaps the less this movie tries to deal with the Roosevelt era the better. Its other big idea is to cast the leads -- Annie herself and the wealthy savior who used to be Daddy Warbucks but is now the grumpy tech millionaire Mr. Stacks -- with African-American stars which isnt necessarily a bad change either. In this version Stacks -- Jamie Foxx -- is running for mayor of New York and his advisor thinks he needs a more human image. And what humanizes a man more than signing up to foster a little orphan particularly when she looks like Quvenzhane Wallis currently stuck under the guardianship of a drunk Cameron Diaz? Wallis who first came to attention in ""Beasts of the Southern Wild"" is cute as a button -- but theres a reason why big-budget movie musicals dont often cast buttons. The girl is adorable but she cant really move her singing is only adequate and her expression rarely varies. As a form of over-compensation perhaps you then have Diaz as the villainous guardian Miss Hannigan who -- also deprived of the two confederates she had in earlier versions -- tries to make up for it by acting for three or four. Diaz mugging is probably funny if youre six years old or left your glasses at home. But if shes always really working it at least she has more to work with than Foxx whose entire character consists of germophobia a couple of spit takes and several bad songs. Of course this movie has been through a lot. At one time Will Smith had picked it out for Willow to star in (it took so long she outgrew it like us); Jay-Z was supposed to write some new songs for it too. At another point Justin Timberlake was going to play the male lead and Sandra Bullock the Hannigan harridan. Things change of course but its still unclear why Will Gluck ultimately ended up as the director. His two biggest films were the smart and sexy ""Easy A"" and the not-as-smart but sexier ""Friends With Benefits."" (The less said about his gross college comedy ""Fired Up"" the better.) What in that brief filmography convinced anyone this was a man with a natural feel for family-friendly musicals is a puzzler. He adds some literally percussive pizzazz to the numbers and he clearly had a good time with the sets (although Hannigans supposedly horrible Harlem apartment looked pretty wonderful to me). But wheres the real fun? Wheres the excitement? Theyre not very apparent here judging by the kids I saw at my screening. The row in front of me spent most of the movie talking. The row behind me beat a bored drumbeat on the back of my seat. Afterward on the escalator one child turned pouting to her mother. ""There wasnt enough of the dog in the movie"" she complained. Oh I dont know. I saw a dog all right. Ratings note The film contains substance abuse and brief violence. Annie (PG) Columbia (118 min.) Directed by Will Gluck.

"Annie Review Quvenzhane Wallis Stars in Ridiculous Remake | Variety Variety Continue to Variety () Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review Annie Ronnie Scheib 82 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr December 14 2014 | 0600AM PT Jamie Foxx and Quvenzhane Wallis competently head up an otherwise poorly thesped and unimaginatively conceived ""Annie"" reboot. While there are several possible good reasons to remake the Depression-set musical ""Annie"" in 2014 none of them seem to have informed Will Glucks overblown yet undernourished treatment. More of a facelift than an update the pic dusts off some old songs adds a few desultory stabs at new ones and stuffs the frame with shiny upscale gadgets that scream ""modern."" Featuring a multiracial all-star cast with few pretensions to dancing expertise the film replaces choreography with metronomic editing while one-note overstatement drowns out character development. Even without the Sony hacking scandal that caused it to leak online early ""Annie"" would seem headed for a lackluster Christmas bow. The film begins promisingly with a pre-credits sequence wherein Gluck acknowledges the obvious parallel between the Great Depression and the currently widening rich/poor divide A schoolroom show-and-tell produces a standard-issue red-haired ""Annie A"" only to replace her with an afrod ""Annie B"" (Quvenzhane Wallis the Academy Award-nominated waif from ""Beasts of the Southern Wild""). Wallis Annie proceeds to conduct the class in an interactive historical performance piece celebrating FDRs New Deal no less. But this hint of modern-day hard times it turns out is evoked only to be treated as a quaint conceit. In Glucks 21st-century version Annie lives with other girls not in an orphanage but in a Harlem foster home run by bitter alcoholic Colleen Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) lamenting her failed career as a backup singer. Poverty in this squeaky-clean Gotham relies entirely on sterile set decoration; a rat under a transparent plastic bowl looks more like an artifact than an actual denizen of Miss Hannigans apartment. Racing through the streets for her dog Sandy (here named after the hurricane in an utterly superfluous example of contemporization) Annie careens into the films reincarnation of Daddy Warbucks aka Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) a cell-phone billionaire running for mayor who absentmindedly saves her from an oncoming car. When a video of the rescue goes viral Stacks opportunistic campaign manager (Bobby Cannavale) arranges a photo session with the adorable moppet which Annie savvily parlays into room and board in exchange for future photo ops. Stacks reluctantly installs her in his palatial penthouse where Annie; Stacks British advisor Grace (Rose Byrne); and a Russian-accented social-services bureaucrat (an excellent Stephanie Kurtzuba) delightedly dance and squeal over each instance of runaway opulence. The rest of the plot roughly follows the original with Annie bringing her patented optimism to bear on the obsessions and bitterness of those around her dispensing epiphanies and granting salvation with the flash of a smile. Wallis conveys the energy and perkiness of her character convincingly and charmingly but lacks even a hint of the desperation that lies behind the belted-out infinite deferral of ""Tomorrow."" Indeed the entire film lacks any sense of poverty beyond the simple absence of luxury. Unlike the New York of Sidney Lumets similarly location-transplanted ""The Wiz"" Glucks Gotham might as well be Toronto with Stacks private helicopter swooping among the shiny glass skyscrapers as yet another bonus of the high life. The acting in general tends toward the one-note and over-the-top. Foxx the films only performer with extensive singing experience onscreen wisely opts for understatement but Diazs slutty dipsomaniac rants on unchecked her falling-down-drunk numbers as unchoreographed as her would-be comic bits are poorly directed. Byrnes line readings verge on the surreal as she attempts to express Graces career-gal loneliness by overprotesting her contentment and Cannavales dirty-tricks politico makes for a flabby villain. Only David Zayas turn as Miss Hannigans eternally ignored but defiantly working-class suitor brings a believable if simplistic sense of class division to the film. Very young kids may be diverted by ""Annies"" wall-to-wall music and nonstop movement; characters rarely pause to take a breath. Special thought was obviously expended on the presentation of the shows Charles Strouse/Martin Charnin standards. ""Its the Hard-Knock Life"" danced by Wallis and the other tyke actors with occasionally percussive object-slamming accompaniment vaguely reminiscent of ""Stomp"" (already feeling more dated than Busby Berkeley) is winningly executed by this exceptionally talented child troupe. By far the films best incorporation of New York locations occurs in the staging of ""Tomorrow"" Like Snow White warbling into her wishing well Wallis starts off singing into a sidewalk rain puddle while Gluck continues to catch her reflection against plate-glass buildings and the windows of passing buses throughout the number.

Seriouslynkt hard to give charater a new name that wull function as title and say inspired by Annie and go on with there modern day story of orphans. Reply Sherron says November 9 2015 at 321 pm I took my 7-year-old daughter to see this movie and we both LOVED it (especially the music). The songs were so catchy that I ended up buying the soundtrack so that we could keep enjoying it. I purchased the movie from the Google play store too. I am a huge fan of the original Annie and now this remake has a special place in my heart also. The casting was very well done. The best thing about this movie IMO is the songs. The plot is still the same classic tale as told in the original Annie. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars Reply Katy Rpss says September 2 2015 at 305 pm Ashlynn I would just like to inform you that you are racist. Before you make a racist comment never start with ""Im not racist"" in the future. I think you are over exaggerating It really wasnt that bad. Annie is not a factual event therefore it doesnt matter that the color of her changes. The most important thing is that its a story about a young foster child who gets a family it has nothing to do with the color. Its a shame you dont see that and you only see color and therefore have come to the conclusion that the movie is bad because of the cast. Reply Katy Rpss says September 2 2015 at 258 pm I really enjoyed Annie 2014. I think it was a modern twist on the classic and would like to see more remakes like this. Really good work Reply ashlynn says August 15 2015 at 723 pm Well I watched it half way through. The original is waaay better. (Including casting and songs and just everything. ) Im by no means a racist but really? Recasting the whole classical film with african Americans? Thats like making Dorothy from wizard of oz African American. It just ruins the classicness of it all. Or making the huge ass magical man from the green mile a white man. Im sorry but stuff like that just ruins it and I apologize if I am offending anyone but I promise I am not a racist. I just think it was not the best move on the directors part. And jamie foxx as daddy warbucks???? (Dont get me wrong hes a amazing actor ) but Jesus christ cocome on now Daddy warbucks is an older very rich man. And fucking CAMERON DIAZ as Miss Hannagon? You have got to be kidding me First of all miss hanagan is very homely looking and mean as hell And Cameron Diaz just doesnt fit the part. Sorry. Well on sure our youth will enjoy this film. With all I have said it does send very important messages. And once again if I offended anyone I sincerely apologize. That was never ever my intent. My opinion is if youre not watching as a family dont even bother. All it will do is piss you off with every scene. How dare they do this to a classical musical film like ""Annie"". Oh another thing. Annie is a 10 year old Red head girl with freckles. Enough said. Reply Harrow Q says August 15 2015 at 355 pm Its a shame how bad it was because I liked it at first but then it got really boring and didnt recover. Too much talky talky not enough singy singy. Reply Nick says April 12 2016 at 611 am I agree Im sick of Black remakes of Classic White films the Original Annie cant be topped so why bother this didnt come close and dont get me started on the Wiz.. If you have that much talent available then use it to make a good or great film but dont try to remake a classic in ebony its never worked and never will Reply Elena says June 7 2015 at 634 pm I personally love this movie. It was so much better than the original. The modern take the cast and crew made was such a fun feeling movie. I really am past impressed. I loved the songs the acting and the plot line flowed very nicely. Five out of five stars Reply mark says August 2 2015 at 723 pm No. It was a flop and far worse than the original. Just look at the ratings of the public and critics. Worse Both rate the movie in the toilet. This was not Harold Grays Annie but a ludicrous insidious imposter. Reply Nick says April 12 2016 at 627 am I agree I mean seriously how would it be if White Actors remade ""Roots"" or ""Porgy and Bess""? S Sanford says April 4 2015 at 549 am Annie was a great movie for kids. The fact that there arent many kid friendly movies that come out besides cartoons if I had a little girl we would have seen this movie more than once. Reply Rev. Dr.Rebecca Stitt says January 27 2015 at 400 am My grandchildren have seen the movie 3 times. I loved it it was refreshing and family friendly. We are shocked that this movie was snubbed. We are also disappointed that this movie did not get good reviews. Reply nanastinky says January 24 2015 at 1005 am We are HUGE Fans of the original Annie movie. My kids probably watch it at least once a week and have done so their entire lives so far. I didnt know what to expect. We went in knowing that this was a kids movie (geared toward children) and that it was probably not going to be a copy/replay of the original(because who would accept that?). We just hoped that it would turn out better than the horrible 80s Annie adventure/flop. We were all pleasantly surprised It used the name Annie to get the needed attention and loosely held to the cast of characters. The songs were done in completely different styles and only borrowed some of the original lyrics (there were also a few new ones). They held to the no parent adopted by millionaire theme (but that is really an old often reused theme).It was different enough so that none of us found ourselves comparing the new to the old. My kids smiled and laughed through most of the movie. I (along with every other mother in our group) found myself tearing up a couple of times especially during Annie (impromptu) solo ""Opportunity"". Overall it was a fun and touching movie and my children(who usually dont like to sit in the theater very long) immediately asked to see it again. I wasnt as thrilled with the song little girls (should have changed it a bit more it left me comparing) and I think Im gonna like it here was pretty terrible (they should have left it out completely). Other than that the music was fun. Reply wiles11 says May 21 2015 at 1123 pm Yeah but despite everything you say you carry a HUGE bias by dint of being a mom and attending with a ""group."" Otherwisethis critic is bang on about everything that is blatantly obviously wrong with this film. That you found so much to like only suggests youre willing to settle for glossy ineffectual blandness that wont challenge your little darlings too much. I was pleasantly surprised how accurately this critic NAILED everything I felt was wrong with it immediately after it ended. One more thing just because lots of KIDS like it doesnt automatically make it good. Reply Tricia says January 15 2015 at 1041 pm Soooo disappointed was excited to take my nieces to see Annie but the lead girl Ill call her Q"" should have studied Ailleen Quinn that little could singdance and act this was bad.She was not believable.you mean to tell me they couldnt find a better actress in LA So what she has an award Booooooo hisssss Reply Diego says January 14 2015 at 1254 pm HET FOR ALL OF YOU THAT THINK THE REMAKE IS RIDICULOUSGUESS WHAT I HAVE SOMETHING WAITING FOR YOU...............WHY DONT YOU STEP INTO MY OVEN Reply Janice.hallbajek says January 11 2015 at 936 pm I am a 62 year old Grandmother l have followed a lot of remakes in my time this one of the best Annie was so much fun I will see it again. Reply noque says January 6 2015 at 1249 pm I really tried to be open minded about this movie and also I understand the importance of making movies that appeal to the kids accross the race barriers. I wanted to support this movie especially with the racial backlash from people outraged to see a little black girl as annie... so the intention was good the idea was good the challenge was there but lets face it.. it was a total miss the movie simply isnt good worst it is bad...surely kids will still enjoy it but thats about it so I guess their mission was accomplished there. It just feel like in the name of change and modernization they hired a bunch of stylist and music producers to make this movie it is shot like a music video i counted like 7 references to twitter in the first half. It feels like a few people sat in a room and asked themselve what are kids into these days? So the story is completely drawned into that chaos... Annie is seen like a little street hustler or something they are telling kids like it is ok to compromise for a bit of fame and money...she actually goes to live with a stranger just because he is rich at first not because there is any real emotional connection there.. i mean that is what i got... total miss and i am 28. If I was Quvensanehs manager I would ve said no to this movie because beast of the southern wild was launching her into the path of real acting great quality movies complex characters... not this. Surely she will come back from it even though her performance was really really rigid.. i blame it on poor direction... Girl should ve said no like Willow... anyways again kids will enjoy it maybe Reply Shania says January 5 2015 at 900 pm Anyone that gives this movie a bad review is stuck in old ways. And may need to get the fuck out of the 80s. Because this 2014 shit changes damn. Who cares if it wasnt what you expected. Its to entertain who ever enjoys it. I watched this movie 6 times. And me and my brothers loved it. We also seen the original and love that one two. I love musicals period. But just because your were looking for parts of the movie that may be like the original and got dissapointed does not mean you should give this movie such hate. It hurts to read these comments and knowing that most of these actors had and people involved worked hard on the movie just to be able to male someone laugh and smile. It is just shameful... Reply Anora says January 5 2015 at 415 pm YA know what... I actually enjoyed the film... It was overall a good movie. Sure its not like the first one but its more modern than the first and updated. It was actually really good and I liked it even my brother liked it There are a lot of negative things but I give it four stars and a half Reply Tinker says February 27 2015 at 628 am Nice mouth on you. Reply Serena Angelique says December 30 2014 at 408 pm I had low expectations for ""Annie."" Very low. But the director should possibly be imprisoned and he must never be allowed to make another movie again. This film may have the distinction of being both the worst adaptation AND worst remake in the history of terrible adaptations and remakes and everything about it was unforgivable casting acting old songs new songs. Ms. Wallis is just a little too one dimensional and though shes not godawful (like Cameron Diaz) she is underwhelming. Jamie Foxx is patently boring. The orphans? Why did they even bother having orphans? They offer absolutely nothing and are just excess baggage to weigh this clunker down even more (if thats possible). I am a fan of the play but not so much of the John Huston vehicle with Aileen Quinn in the original movie ""Annie. Still at least that was watchable and not a bleak embarrassment to the material. The John Huston ""Annie"" had a certain amount of charm as a big budget extravaganza that mostly delivered ""something"" to its audiences. It was familiar and true to the Tony Award winning show and it stuck to the plot without veering way off into left field like this version riddled with bogus issues like Annie harboring the terrible secret of being illiterate or having been abandoned at an Italian trattoria called ""Domani"" (a kind of an aside and nod to the play because domani means ""tomorrow"" in Italian). This West Village eatery is so high end that no parents who could afford to eat there would not be able to take care of their child. Still every Friday Annie races there to see if her parents will return for her and some cannoli as if thats something folks do as an end of the week ritual years after kicking their kid to the curb. Its not that I even mind the fact that they decided to make Annie Black or set it in modern times. in fact had it been done right it could have been great but the changes that have been made here are abysmal at best. Why even call it Annie? The plot has so many holes and terrible jokes that its truly painful to sit through two hours of such unabashed rot. The new songs are also laughable and so unmemorable that this ""Annie"" would actually work better as a silent movie. At least it would save us from the frustration of having to listen to the lackluster hip hop riddled soundtrack that massacres classics like ""Tomorrow"" or ""Little Girls."" Beware of people who indignantly assert ""I dont know why this ""Annie"" is getting such bad reviews?"" Ill tell you why. Its because its worse than you can imagine Your child may want to see it and therefore you may have no other way of getting around it but there is no other reason on earth to suffer through this hot mess that no adult human or animal should be subjected to. Reply Sharie says December 27 2014 at 131 pm Loved it my 3 grandchildren thought it was the best annie yet and we have seen them all Reply mel says December 26 2014 at 748 pm Long and boring my little girls did not enjoy it. I did not feel a connection to any of the characters. Annies friends were barely there and not all that likeable. Miss Hannigan was awful and thats putting it nicely.

Reply loco73 says December 21 2014 at 1214 am Much like it recently did with ""Exodus Gods And Kings"" Hollywoods quest to take one giant dump after another on its sheep-like-audiences weve now gotten and ""updated"" version of ""Annie"". You see ever since Hollywood has pelted and suffocated us with re-makes reboots re-boots of reboots prequels and sequels we didnt want or ask for...now their newest brainfart more to do with corporate lingo changes than actual cinematic substance...is ""updated movies""...yeah that makes about as much sense as George W.

Reply Janstl says December 20 2014 at 330 pm Foxx was horrible. Diaz was horrible. And I found Annie less than endearing. The story dragged and some of the music was mediocre at best. Too bad North Korea didnt stall this one I wanted to see the interview too Really this is a waste of time and money. Try a Netflix night instead. Reply charlie scott says December 19 2014 at 1223 pm Ive seen the play the 1982 movie the tv movie and now this. And Ive read the comics. And this new movie is terrible. Its poorly acted directed filmed. Why the heck was Diaz who cant sing cast where there are dozens of woman of the same age and look who can not only sing but are far better actors. Like the TV movie this one missed the story. They focus too much on the poor kid adopted by a rich guy parts and didnt pay attention to what made the original story work. Like the sense of utter despair in the whole country because of the Great Depression Annies absolute lack of options for any other life the simple joy that came from smuggling a dog into the orphanage. Some reviewers say that the 1982 Annie sucked cause she was a far too happy drip but that was the point. Kids can be like that. Even when they are sinking in a crap pit many of them do find a way to be happy. and the whole ""I think Im going to like it here"" worked because Annie had never even heard of such opulence much less seen it. It was like being swept up to some magical fantasy land (which is why the servant that seems to do magic actually works). This Annie would have seen such riches on TV etc. and shes far more conniving which actually ruins the notion of joyful innocence. Had she been more like Quvenzhanes character in Beasts the whole thing would have worked better because it would have been closer to the sweet childs innocence in the midst of literally nothing which is at the heart of the original story.

Reply WEHO says December 14 2014 at 858 pm More slop from Sony. Reply Alvie Noelle says December 14 2014 at 752 pm I went to an Annie screening this past Saturday in SF. From reading the comments Ive noticed no one has mentioned the actual Little Orphan Annie comic strip in their critiques. If anyone had read the comics they would understand a LOT of the references in this incarnation of Annie. I was a Little Orphan Annie fan since the original 1980s movie. Ive never seen the play but after seeing the movie I read amp; collected the comics in collector books. I also read the biography of Harold Gray Annies comic creator. Points to make here 1. Sandys name has ALWAYS been Sandy. Thats straight from the original comic strip and has NEVER been from ""Hurricane Sandy."" 2. In both the play and both earlier movies FDR played a significant cameo as a plot point in Daddy Warbucks softening capitalistic heart. FDR wanted Warbucks support for one of his work programs (according to the play amp; earlier movies) which stood opposite Warbucks (and creator Harold Grays) anti-welfare and anti-child labor laws views. The reason 2014 Annie was giving a report on FDR was the screenwriters way of putting FDR into the movie as an homage to his previous physical presence in the earlier material AND to hint at 2014 Annies literacy problem that she cleverly hid by making her ""report"" a performance piece. 3. There are other ""Homage/Easter Eggs"" in the 2014 movie that call back to the comic strip/play/earlier movies like Will Stacks Helicopter the chase over George Washington Bridge and even the opponent mayors name being ""Harold Gray."" Cracked me up that THAT Harold Gray was portrayed as a liberal-type mayor the antithesis to the real Gray. If you know the comic strip then the movie makes more sense. What doesnt -and will never- make sense is casting Cameron Diaz as Miss Hannigan. She was NEVER that man hungry Money hungry yes but not this sloppy. Her ""Change of Heart"" arc at the end came out of nowhere amp; had no context and her portrayal was just a mess. Except for Jamie Foxx who rules all (I dont care) and CAN sing the rest of the cast was .... adequate in their singing. I guess Im more forgiving of the singing quality here than I was of Les Miserables. Finally for those who are complaining about the new Annie being Black Im only going to point out two things the whitewashing in ""Exodus"" and the fact that in the first Hunger Games movie some fans got way pissed off at the casting of Rue as a Black child. Rue in the book was described as having dark skin-thus Rue IS Black in the books. And Katniss was described as ""Olive skinned."" I enjoy this 2014 Annie movie for what it is a fun retelling distinct and unique from the original material. Reply rocky-o says December 14 2014 at 516 pm i see alot of responses here dealing with the fact that this new annie is black and that is certainly not surprising good or bad...what i just dont get is why would anyone want to take an iconic character and change it rather than creating a brand new one...remember the movie akeelah and the bee...that was a great movie and nobody cared whether the young girl was black or white...but when there are characters in film literary and even cartoon history (as is annie) that are primarily created as white or like cinderella (who brandi portrayed in a remake) it just doesnt make sense to me to not give a fresh new face to a fresh new character...disney wised up with the princess and the frog having a princess who was black rather than just changing the little mermaid (...and certainly pocahontas had to remain native american instead of something else)...and then there was mulan one of my all time favorite disney characters...and if i were oriental i wouldnt want to see an oriental james bond...i would want a new spy character created who happened to be oriental...or indian or spanish or black or whatever they happen to be...there have been cool individual characters in every race and nationality...why stop now... Reply Anonymous says December 16 2014 at 325 am The original Annie was portrayed as a red head because at the time most people were very hostile towards the Irish due to immigration so making the new Annie black makes perfect context in that sense.

Vandy says December 15 2014 at 910 am Im sorry but I cant handle it. Im sure you meant well but people are not Oriental. Things like rugs that are from ""the orient"" may be called Oriental. If you dont know which part of Asia someone is from then they are Asian. But if you do you say it. As in - Mulan is Chinese. Some of your argument makes sense and some does not. You couldnt change the nationality of many of the fairy tales your bring up because its part of the story. Pocahontas is about Native Americans. Mulan is a Chinese fable. Cinderella is French. But Annie is the story of industrialized America. Her story is about being caught in the system and finding your heart again. American culture isnt based on any race. Its based on the fact that we are all from somewhere else. Its about being self-made. So it doesnt matter what skin color Annie is to make the story. Reply mary e says January 3 2015 at 115 pm The story is about a girl named Annie. Its rather simple. John says December 14 2014 at 722 pm Exactly. If they created a NEW story about a modern foster child in New York City. And even maybe referenced Annie in the movie and were very upfront about it being ""Annie Inspired"" people would have NO problem with this movie. However this movie takes a 100 year old character who has a VERY iconic look - and changes her image. That is where it becomes flawed. If Annie was played by a white BRUNETTE I promise you people would still be upset. Reply Nora knob says December 14 2014 at 159 pm I hope it flops hard. Teach them to mess with beloved classics and try make them all PC and multi-racial. My biggest memory of Annie was the red mop of hair. Its an iconic image and they just threw it out the window as though it was irrelevant. Reply James says December 14 2014 at 430 pm And the first Annie was multi racial? So there can be white movies but no black movies? And if there is all black movies they have to be multi racial movies?

Reply mickrussom says December 14 2014 at 1244 pm I watched the screener today. I can say this. Only the girl Quvenzhane Wallis is notable. I must say her name is rather absurd but thats not her fault. Cameron Diaz performance is one of the worst I have ever seen by someone who claims to be a professional actor. It is seriously ridiculous this was allowed to happen. I would imagine a computer generated performance with an algorithm simulating a cranky woman would give a better performance than Cameron. From the beginning politics and lies start. While FDR has been protected from serious analysis due to his extreme popularity amongst the older people willing to defend him even if this includes bending the truth one cannot say the entire FDR set of policies are perfect or what Annie was saying was true. I find it interesting that she is a ward of the state but her life is hard knock and in the words of another orphan sucks. These very programs are government programs so we have a sucky orphan existence as a ward of the state but we have her worshiping the grandfather of big government? It sounds like the government and this movie are simply parroting NEWSPEAK in a way that indoctrinates. I dont see Jamie Foxxs performance as genuine. His thick ghetto accent coupled with his role as billionaire and potential mayor is ridiculous. I also find it offensive that his corrupt minions are of course of a certain background. Seems the theme here is corruption is white. I also find it amusing the government bureaucrat scum harassing Annie has a broken English accent and basically treats a child like dog meat. This is another government minion who got one of those government jobs created from nothing by fiat. And we see here that those very same employees are rats. I dont get what the theme or message is here. Its very plastic. The theme was set from the get go that FDR created jobs by fiat but every instrument of government in this movie is a slap in the face of Annie. I find also the movies music to be totally inferior. Its pseudo rap/pseudo hip hop. Its a false urban hatcheting of the original set of songs. I also noticed a lot of using of vocoding/auto-tuning here. Which is insulting to the ear and simply lazy. The dance choreography was really horrific. The dancing during the ""I Think Im Going to Like it Here"" ensemble was childish. They spend big money on this remake - I heard north of 50 million. Anyways as usual the Hollywood crowd has has destroyed a childhood memory by injecting class war race and politics into a movie which could have been great especially Q. Wallis seems quite talented despite this movies best efforts to make her look the fool. Reply vp19 says December 15 2014 at 1011 am Ah more silly comments from the ""everything is ideology"" crowd.

You apparently think Annie is a good place to attack government programs because as you perceive it through the very narrow lens of conservative stupidity Annies life as an orphan doesnt suck because she has no parents and nobody to care for her-it sucks because government provide a roof over her head under the misplaced idea that it has some sort or responsibility to children who have nowhere to live and nothing to eat. You are the personification of modern conservative stupidity-you see anything and everything through a political lens and dont even have the intelligence to make a strong argument in support of what you believe or recognize how pathetically small minded and ill informed you sound.

Good job Reply Jonathan Brown says December 14 2014 at 1224 pm To all of the people who say ""Its the worst film"" really have no life and just mad that the main characters (except Miss. Hannigan) are African-American. I actually likes this movie. In my opinion I think this movie was better than the 1999 ""Annie"" film. To all of the people saying that Hollywood shouldnt have black people as a remake of a original film are actually wrong. The original ""Wizard Of Oz"" was remade to ""The Wiz"" featuring Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. ""The Wiz"" actually had more success than the original film. We had the original ""Cinderella"" film. Hollywood did a remake of the original film with Brandy as the main character and it had success. ""African-American"" remakes of original movies have had the same amount of success as original movies. So all of the doubters/movie critics should just shut up. The name of the dog ""Sandy"" was not named by ""Hurricane"" or ""Superstorm"" Sandy. The dogs name is the 1999 film was named ""Sandy."" SMH. I hate it when people are putting HATE on a movie like get a life and do something else. Racism is also still alive because when there is a movie featuring ""Caucasian"" people like ""Twilight"" or ""Hunger Games"" many people (even black people)come to watch it. But when an ""African-American"" movie comes out many racists say that the movie is going to be horrible because there ""Black"" people in the movies and they should go back to ""Africa."" Why are racists telling us to go back to ""Africa"" if their ancestors kidnapped our ancestors brung them to America and tortured us with whips chopping hands/feet off and killing us. Like what did ""African-Americans"" do to you harmfully that made you do racist things. Like get a life. Care about your own-self and stop trying to hurt other races because trying to hurt other races isnt working. We have an ""African-American"" president. We have rich and powerful people from other races other than ""Caucasian."" So to all of the racists in the world who dont like should just commit suicide go to hell and burin in there. All of the previous comments should just shut up and deal with it because they cant do anything to stop it or dont have enough power to stop it. ""African-American"" people and many other races can just have the same success as ""Caucasian"" people. Reply Tammy says December 14 2014 at 708 pm I understand you are hurt but even hurt people dont make up huge lies about something everybody knows about I was old enough in the 70s to see The Wiz but it is simply a huge overstatement to call it more famous than the original.

Reply jhs39 says December 14 2014 at 125 pm You lost me when you claimed that The Wiz was a more successful movie than The Wizard of Oz-the original film wasnt a big hit in its original release but became a huge success in subsequent re-releases and home video and is one of the most beloved family movies ever produced by Hollywood. The Wiz was a box office flop that very few people consider a classic. The Wizard of Oz made more money theatrically than The Wiz just in limited theatrical releases between 1989 and 2013-thats not counting any of The Wizard of Ozs actual wide releases in 1939 1949 and 1955.

Its just two characters. And they say we have advanced in race relations? What a joke. Reply James says December 14 2014 at 436 pm Exactly what I said. Smh its because most of these people on here racist and dont want see black people doing anything when there is a lot of all white movies that dont involve not one black person in it But complaining about Annie being a black girl. So yes this is a joke. Reply ETEXEC says December 14 2014 at 1145 am Cameron Diaz is 100% headed to Razzie town. Her performance is grade-F career-destroying work. CAA better start working on the separation letter. For that matter so should Will Glucks representation. After this turkey he will be a leper around town. In fact I hope that no one involved in this movie ever works in Hollywood again. Even the 1982 movie misfire at least understood that all the shiny happy-go-lucky pastiche of musical numbers like ""Tomorrow"" and ""Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" stood in stark ironic contrast to the horrific context of the Great Depression. This movie version doesnt give a F (the bright shiny New York that Annie jaunts through in the opening credits appears to be an extension of Sesame Street and has no actual basis in reality) and instead aims for pure syrupy confection with overproduced bombastic musical numbers and an autotune budget bigger than Chers and Lil Waynes PUT TOGETHER. The biggest disappointment is that Annie is due for a refresh what with the income divide wider now than at any point in history. I dont dislike that Annie is black or that the cast is multi-culti but this film is so tone-deaf and tonally deaf. This film is ignorant cancer. Its that offensive. If you take your children to see this movie please leave your contact information with the usher because they are contractually obligated to report you to Child Protective Services for being a truly mendacious horrible parent. Reply Yo mama says December 14 2014 at 1136 am I would love it if they remade Roots or 12 Years a Slave but with other races. Maybe with a Polish Jews perspective in 1940? Or you could use Indian characters who are now slaves in Dubai? Face it making an old movie that had nothing to do with a particular race and remaking it to fit a black audience is racist. Same with The Wiz. Why cant there just be a normal black movie without it sounding like Al Sharpton wrote it? Reply jhs39 says December 14 2014 at 133 pm Annie wasnt remade for a black audience unless you think all movies starring black actors should be avoided. Other than the characters of Annie and Daddy Warbucks most of the cast is white or Hispanic. Reply cadavra says December 14 2014 at 1019 am In the very first episode of BOSTON LEGAL Al Sharpton-playing himself-petitions the court to rule in favor of a black Annie (""Not Tomorrow-Today""). I wonder if someone watched that and thought ""Hey thats a great idea"" Somewhere David E. Kelley must be laughing his ass off. Reply vp19 says December 15 2014 at 1020 am Can we find a deserted island for ambulance chasers Al Sharpton and Gloria Allred? They diminish genuine problems of racism and sexism by instead making it all about them instead and wish those who are involved in such problems would tell them to go to help and look for other spokespersons. As far as the 2014 ""Annie"" is concerned her color is irrelevant to me but it appears this movie is a disjointed mess. Reply cadavra says December 15 2014 at 1106 am You clearly havent seen the episode in question. The tone was comedic and Sharpton was playing a self-caricature. Im no fan of him either but he at least has a sense of humor about himself using comedy to make a very real point about latent racism. jnf663 says December 14 2014 at 945 am I am sure this movie is bad but Sandy is not named after the hurricane. Sandys been the name of her dog since the original Harold Gray comics in the 30s. Reply jhs39 says December 14 2014 at 135 pm Im pretty sure the reviewer was saying Annie named her dog Sandy after the hurricane in this movie. Reply nala says December 14 2014 at 928 am I CANT WAIT Reply skep41 says December 14 2014 at 841 am John Huston was one of the greatest American directors. Carol Burnett was one of Americas foremost comediennes. Remaking Annie when it has been done so well shows the absolute intellectual bankruptcy of the corporate robots who said yes to this hopeless enterprise. What next? What century-old overdone mindless soulless remake will these hacks waste their money on next? Big is truly the opposite of Cool and these giant corporate entities attempts to create what they call product and market it as art are always doomed to failure. Art is a product of risk. Risk is anathema to these bean-counters which ensures they will fail. No risk in that...its a certainty and this movie proves it. Reply jhs39 says December 14 2014 at 144 pm If you go through John Hustons long filmography he probably made at least five mediocre to bad ones for every good film. The obvious thing you seem to be missing is that John Huston made movies in the 1940s 1950s and 1960s all decades where movie musicals were very popular and John Huston never made one. His first and only musical was the Annie film in 1982 and he proved to be a terrible choice to direct a musical even with The Maltese Falcon and Treasure of the Sierra Madras on his resume. The 1999 made for TV version directed by Rob Marshall (Chicago) was a big improvement over John Hustons lead-footed theatrical version. Reply Goodbyenoway says December 14 2014 at 753 am This would make my list of the Top Ten Worst Films Ive seen in my life. Hollywood doesnt know how to make musicals anymore from awful Chicago which seemed like a choppy music video to this latest abomination. They dont seem to get they need to cast people who can sing and/or dance. And writers and directors who understand musicals. All are absent here. Reply Pat says December 14 2014 at 635 am No Thanks. Reply jeff says December 14 2014 at 632 am i am sorry but i will not go see this annie. there has been a good many remakes of annie and none have toped the one with carol burnet and alber finney in it. Reply jhs39 says December 14 2014 at 145 pm I thought the 1999 made for TV version easily topped the one with Albert Finney. Reply macd says December 14 2014 at 430 pm Agreed I was lucky enough to see ""Annie"" on its Broadway opening night and I loved it. Andrea McArdle will forever be the definitive Annie. The vulgar 1982 film version was doomed the minute Columbia hired John Huston to direct it; even Albert Finney amp; Carol Burnett couldnt save this disaster. So I was shocked by how good the 90-minute (commercials excluded) 1999 TV-movie was. Nor do I recall anyone even noticing that the superb Audra McDonald played the female lead (thereby implying that her relationship with Daddy Warbucks was an interracial romance). But for my money the 1999 ""Annie"" was perfect and there was absolutely no need for another remake especially one as rotten as this one. Matthew says December 14 2014 at 404 pm The TV version was HORRIBLE. Miss Hannigan being nice to Annie pretending to be her mother instead of Lily and getting sent to the mental hospital in the end was unforgivable. Annie being turned into yet another Passive Disney Girl who probably couldnt survive a minute in the streets of Depression-era New York was just as bad. And they wore the radio show down to a nub. I wont mention the complete lack of sexual chemistry between Victor Garber and Audra McDonald (since when does Grace Farrell sing ""Tomorrow""). Do you really believe this guy would marry a black woman in 1933? Today its conceivable. Then doubtful. He never would have been able to do business in the South again and might even have had to leave the country. Its insulting to ones intelligence to put this film in an alternate-reality 1930s America where the stigma against interracial relationships never existed especially when its a period piece. And wheres FDR? What happened to Hooverville? He shows up at the end seemingly out of nowhere. And of the six songs from the play the movie left out only two were put back. And they forgot it used to be a musical COMEDY. The whole point of that production was to offer a more faithful complement to the 1982 film but they still made changes. Stupid ones. Changes to stuff even John Huston had the good sense to leave alone. It was one of the most excruciating 90 minutes Id ever spent in my life. This new one is worse though. It looks like they threw out the baby the bathwater and the bathtub. Ive only seen two of the clips that made it to YouTube and I was horrified. They just keep getting progressively worse with each new adaptation. Glenn C. says December 14 2014 at 627 am No way Better things to do. Reply sehcoop says December 20 2014 at 753 pm I saw this movie and can honesty say it was entertaining. It is kinda sad that so many of us take something like a movie so serious when it is just a movie. I only wish that we all could use such skills to solve the problems of the world. Maybe they will make a movie one day with that theme Reply See All 82 Comments More Film News from Variety The Power of Content ABC Discovers Digital Talent Competition Announces Winner Liam Payne amp; Cheryl Fernandez-Versini Collaborating On Love Song...

After the election once shes no longer needed the campaign will discard the girl like so much sour milk. Even Michael Bloomberg only circumvented the law for his political ambitions. Despite reservations about sharing his cavernous penthouse cell-phone magnate Will Stacks (Jamie Foxx) agrees to the temporary-guardianship plan thought up by his devilish campaign adviser Guy (Bobby Cannavale). That Wills assistant and effective angel-on-his-shoulder Grace (Rose Byrne) never strongly protests this immoral (and dumb) campaign strategy is a sign of the disenchantment even misanthropy that seeps through Will Glucks reinterpretation of the Broadway classic. Quvenzhane Wallis poofy-haired flower-trousered Annie remains an eternal optimist but this child of the system also knows how to play Katniss Everdeen acutely aware that her survival or at least her immediate well-being depends on performing for the cameras. See video TheWraps Trailer Trash Talk Annie Starring Quvenzhane Wallis Jamie Foxx Cameron Diaz Other hints of darkness - clumsy stabs at realism really - dampen the musicals inborn cheeriness without lending it gravitas. But there are still bits of the ""Annie"" you remember in particular the joy in synchronized dancing with mops and in pulling one over on witchy Miss Hannigan (Cameron Diaz) Annies lush of a caretaker. And of course theres ""Annies"" perpetual appeal the fantasy of instant fortune never more relevant than in these historically unequal times. Gluck and Aline Brosh McKennas shaggy script lightly chides the sneaky way Will really makes his money but the film is far more interested in what his money can buy floor-to-ceiling windows a private helicopter appliances that read your mind and invitations to over-the-top movie premieres seemingly designed by Baz Luhrmann for Gatsby Jr. complete with free clothes giant lollipops and dancers dressed up like mermaids. Amid the wealth porn is the obligatory moralizing about hard work expounded by Will in a song called ""Opportunity"" one of the films three original (and totally forgettable) tunes. ""Lucks for suckers"" agrees Annie even though her first meeting with Will - when he rescues her from getting pancaked by a speeding truck - was completely inadvertent. The other concessions to parents fare better. For adult pop-culture obsessives theres a long-running series of jokes about  C+C Music Factory and a very funny movie-within-a-movie ""directed"" by one of the most impressive filmmaking duos working today. See video Little Orphan Annie is Now a Horrible Drunk Who Invented an STD Medication No amount of self-referential jokes can make up for a lack of heart and spirit and thankfully ""Annie"" lacks neither. Wallis is only passable as an actress and a singer here - a fact the film seems to acknowledge by drowning out her vocal performances with thudding musical arrangements. Byrne is ever winsome in an undemanding role shaded by layers of loneliness. And though were never really sure why Will runs for mayor especially when he offers only a heavily Purelled finger to a potential supporter who wants to shake his hand Foxx makes us believe that his character is the one that truly needs saving. Even when Guy pushes Annie into a horrifying fate Foxx is the one we cant stop watching as he sings and dances circles around the rest of the cast. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
