"Violent Bores << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com  Previous Theyre Back Baby  Next The Fouettes en Tournant of the WTA Lionsgate Facebook Twitter Print Series Violent Bores Yawning through The Last Stand and Broken City by Wesley Morris on January 18 2013 This is probably not the week to release a movie in which Johnny Knoxville feeds a belt of bullets into an antique machine gun as Arnold Schwarzenegger mows down an assortment of armed and anonymous men. But anything this artillery-crazed and starring a former elected official whose nom de guerre was ""The Governator"" doesnt care about the national climate on guns. Bullets are simply part of the weather in The Last Stand Kevlar being the preferred umbrella. The weaponry is so ridiculously bountiful that the movie must be a defense against something. But its just another lousy action movie. And for more than an hour its less than that. Schwarzenegger plays the sheriff of a sleepy saloony Arizona town that abuts Mexico. A drug lord has sprung himself from a Las Vegas prison and is headed the sheriffs way to speed across a bridge hes had custom-made to cross the border. Its not worth going into why the drug lord has handcuffed a sexy agent inside his speeding Corvette or what Forest Whitaker is doing leading the team of feds pursuing this fugitive. And why go into what nincompoops the sheriffs deputies are? Or how nothing that precedes the big high-noon shootout matters -- not the goon squad captained by Peter Stormare the Nordic nut from Fargo; not the many lifeless scenes with Whitaker and the FBI; not one minute of time spent with Schwarzenegger whose face is too tight and tan and whose hair too fussed over and chestnut to be as Clint Eastwood-crusty as the movie needs. No the entire movie exists for the climactic high-noon shootout in which Stomares team and the sheriffs five-person crew including Knoxville Rodrigo Santoro and Luis Guzman blast away at each other. Its violence has a gathering comedic force. Its vaguely funny the way a flare gun has been rigged to simulate a grenade launcher so that when the flare hits a body it produces fireworks and then detonates sending an arm say hurtling through the air. Its the only kind of mayhem Jee-woon Kim knows. Kim is a relentless South Korean whose specialty is queasy genre junk -- whether its horror (A Tale of Two Sisters); spaghetti western (The Good the Bad the Weird) or vengeful cop procedural (I Saw the Devil). If he can take things too far hell take them even further. An ungainly mix of comedy violence sadism and schlock obviously arouses him. But the fun and tension of his moviemaking gradually devolves into tedium. Even with all the competing tones his movies have one note that Kim is cocky enough to think he can sustain for more than two hours. The Last Stand is his first Hollywood movie and his first in English and until the movies standoff he doesnt get to apply any of his crazy sensibility to the dime-store action-thriller script thats credited to Andrew Knauer. Kim operates in the same family as both John Woo and Quentin Tarantino but he lacks Woos soulfulness and Tarantinos ingenuity. Still when he gets going toward the end of The Last Stand the movie wakes up and manages to distinguish itself at least from whatever straight-to-videoness we typically associate with an actor like Jeff Fahey. The showdown is shot in daylight and the camera zooms and caroms and attached to a school bus spins in the dirt. When Kim tires of guns he stages a second climax -- a two-car chase in a cornfield -- then a third featuring UFC-worthy body-to-body combat. He goes through styles of violence the way you might navigate a department store. Eighth floor. Cutlery Of course the grammar used to create the mayhem is all military. Most of the men in this sequence are ex-soldiers and Marines and the way the artillery is fired or the way these guys tip-toe-sprint across an ominously empty Main Street or walk up a flight of stairs while shooting feels very much like war -- both the news medias approximations of combat and what passes for it in movies and video games. Kim isnt taking seriously any of those serious evocations though. That man-to-man showdown manages to give Schwarzenegger a good line about immigrants and immigrants pride. But its hollow since the violence in the movie has really been scrubbed clean of real politics. Its not small-town Americans trading fire with Mexican drug cartels. Its small-town Americans blowing away enemies in a single-shooter game. Youre never distracted from the stultifying emptiness of it all. The Last Stand yes. But what on earth is it standing for? Broken City is even blander and stands for less. Its a local-government corruption thriller that doesnt care about logic or consistency or the people watching it. It feels like an accident a movie you find in progress on Cinemax at 235 a.m. and cant believe you missed until the moment arrives when you cant believe youre still watching. But a film starring Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe and Catherine Zeta-Jones will do that to the best of us. When was the movie even made? 1998? 2003? Last year? Its not just that the music cues are baffling. Yes somebodys got an iPhone and the DJ at a movie-premiere soiree puts on DMXs ""Party Up"" which is 13 years old. (But that could merely signify excellent taste since its the sort of song a DJ should always play.) The reason to feel confused about this movie is that it has Mark Wahlberg as a rogue cop turned private eye. It has Crowe as the mayor of a New York City that may as well be Detroit (that unfortunately would be Broke-Ass City; filmed in New Orleans its actually the Big Easy pretending to be the Big Apple). It has Zeta-Jones in the sort of role that gives you the fake-Faye Dunaway blues. This is a movie that these three would have made 15 years ago when their careers were different. Its the sort of movie you expect from three actors with a lot of promise not from three stars who should know better. But here they are seeming far more washed up than is any kind of right. And in the name of what? A film that reminds us that some public officials are greedy some cops are heartless and the wives of public officials are slutty until proven innocent? Wahlberg is Billy Taggart an NYPD detective who shoots a suspected rapist and murderer in a housing project. A judge exonerates him but the mayor and the chief of police (Jeffrey Wright) ask him to resign lest the question of whether he murdered that rapist persist. Seven years immediately pass and Taggart is working as an underpaid private eye whose services the mayor suddenly needs. The mayors wife is sleeping with another man. And I was certain this was a terrible movie and that no cared how bad it was when Crowe went on a tirade about wanting Taggart to reveal how well-endowed the other man is and whether she fakes her orgasms with him the way she does with the mayor whos campaigning for reelection. Its an embarrassing speech that manages to make the character less credible than he already is. And with still 90 minutes left Its as intriguing as spending 100 minutes watching a lamp. But a lamp at least illuminates. Where all of this leads is so much less interesting than it should be. Ive rarely been this confused by a thriller. Is there something afoot with the mayors rich young opponent (Barry Pepper)? Is that something homosexual or not? How absurd is the scheme that the mayor wants to pull off with that housing project? And why isnt the movie which Brian Tucker wrote and Allen Hughes directed more about that? And why do we have to go to that movie premiere of Taggarts ""indie-film"" actress girlfriend (Natalie Martinez)? And what independent movie has looked this much like both a 98 Degrees music video and an episode of Red Shoe Diaries? Where it all winds up is as intriguing as spending 100 minutes watching a lamp. But a lamp at least illuminates. This is the sort of movie Sidney Lumet made about five times. But even when they didnt work those movies -- Serpico Prince of the City Power Q amp; A Night Falls on Manhattan -- had an electric charge. They had something to say about ego and power and corruption. They were New York movies that could provide an x-ray of their broken city and surprise and move you with their histrionics. Hughes -- working for the first time without his twin brother Albert -- has exactly one great idea and its to shoot Wahlberg drunk on the streets throwing a bottle at an SUV and beating up a guy on the sidewalk. But he gives it to us as a montage that lasts about a minute. This sequence should be the dramatic centerpiece -- since Taggart was an alcoholic who sobered up for his girlfriend and has now thanks to the embarrassment of her movie fallen off the wagon. We see him down three or four or five shots rough up her costar and go on that mini-rampage. But then the phone rings. Its the screenplay calling with shocking news. And Taggart is magically sober enough to resume advancing this nonsense plot. If Broken City couldnt be Sidney Lumet it could at least have been good trash. But its not even filthy enough for that. For one thing Hughes and Tucker arent thinking clearly enough to get the movie down into the gutter. For another I dont know that Hughes couldve gotten his stars to go there with him. None of them wants to commit to breaking a sweat lest we think they actually cared. Only Pepper and Wright lower themselves to the potential luridness. Pepper is a Canadian whos never sounded more from British Columbia than he does here weeping and pontificating. He has to do too much with this vaguely written part which is nice since no one around him is really doing anything with theirs. Wright meanwhile is playing the kind of corkscrewed cop that calls for cockeyed deviance. I also like the sass and backhanded affection Alona Tal uses to play Taggarts assistant. Otherwise this is just more exercise for Zeta-Jones who hasnt carried a movie in almost a decade. She and Crowe are ideally matched. Hes the bigger actor. Shes the better star. But neither does the other any favors. Between this and his two-note singing in Les Miserables Crowes going through a real miscasting phase. Throwing himself into the Seine as he does in Les Mis was a shrewd preemptive strike against having to read the reviews. This time he spares himself the East River but this new part is all wrong for him too. That beefiness of his still bespeaks power but here its not city-hall muscle you sense. Its Wall Street shadiness. Who would vote such a tan oily douchebag to run their city? Hes in the wrong movie. Crowe should be manning heavy weaponry in Arizona. He should be playing the bellicose sheriff not the sleazy mayor.

But give him a poor script like the one for derivative political thriller Broken City and hes the acting equivalent of slow-drying paint. Wahlberg stars as Billy Taggart (now thats a movie hero name) a disgraced cop turned private detective whose work for New York Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) leads him to uncover a seedy web of intrigue double-dealing backhand payments and... are we still awake? Broken City is never actively bad and it borders on entertaining at times. But from the frosty photography to the forgettable score from the by-numbers dialogue to the non-committed performances its a pale imitation of more memorable movies and TV shows notably All the Presidents Men and State of Play. Its a shame because somewhere in here theres a cogent timely attack on the links between business and politics.

Hacked out by one of the twin Hughes brothers who directed the Jack the Ripper potboiler From Hell Allen Hughess Broken City is another feverish thickly plotted overwritten and ultimately preposterous tale of sordid New York political corruption in which nothing much rings true. Manhattan is played by New Orleans for starters. The crooked mayor is played by the mumbling Russell Crowe a combination crime lord and urban hatchetman who runs every vice in town owns City Hall and bribes everyone onto his personal payroll from Harlem landlords to the NYPD yet speaks in such a whisper that his voice is drowned out by the ice melting in a highball glass. What were they thinking? Under the circumstances Mark Wahlberg soars as Billy Taggart a cop who is framed by the mayor for the fatal shooting of a teenage punk and drummed off the force. Seven years later the incumbent mayor still mumbling and in the middle of a controversial election offers Billy now working as a private eye 50000 to track down photograph and reveal the identity of a man he suspects of sleeping with his luscious wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) before it gets into The New York Post. Billy quickly sniffs out her lover as Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler) who happens to be the campaign manager for the mayors rival--a rich liberal and inexplicably honest city councilman absurdly named Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). His goal is to clean up the city but before Billy can collect his fee and join the good guys to get even with the mayor who betrayed him Andrews is brutally murdered and Billy is up to his preppy haircut in intrigues that lead all the way to the police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright). On the wagon for seven years Billy then sees his Latino actress girlfriend in a hot sex scene in her first film and orders a double whiskey. But this is just the beginning of a series of subplots with more holes than a Brooklyn street after a January snowstorm. Now in revenge mode its up to the private dick to set things straight smashing up the city traffic in the process. Broken City paints a grim picture of New York as a lawless chunk of decaying real estate where the mayor offers everyone at City Hall a cocktail during working hours and cops think nothing of knocking back a few on duty. Theres also a labyrinthine plot about a multibillion-dollar deal to sell public housing to criminal stock market financiers that is never convincingly explained but the biggest mystery--why the mayor chose Billy to do his dirty work--is not solved until the very end. Meanwhile the somersaulting screenplay by Brian Tucker has an odd way of stretching out the definition of film noir--with plot interruptions about double-crosses extortions and assorted larcenies too complex to keep up with and too many tertiary characters who only fog up the lens. The bombastic action sequences on dark New York streets the good-looking clothes and the jarring music are of the present but everything seems to be taking place in some long-ago era from the Police Gazette. Mark Wahlberg even shaves. Ultimately everyone in the movie is wasted including Catherine Zeta-Jones who provides great eye candy but has nothing important to say or do. Most of the roles are so ambiguous you end up scratching your head in the final reel and some of the loose ends are so irrelevant they seem to have ended up on the cutting-room floor. With Russell Crowe it really helps if you can read lips. rreedobserver.com BROKEN CITY Running Time 109 minutes Written by Brian Tucker Directed by Allen Hughes Starring Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe and Catherine Zeta-Jones 2/4 Comment Filed under movie Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics The Man Who Made Blue Oyster Cult RIP Producer Sandy Pearlman Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP,http://observer.com/2013/01/the-road-map-to-broken-city-is-all-potholes-and-detours/,200,brokencity3,brokencity,com/2013/01/the-road-map-to-broken-city-is-all-potholes-and-detours/

The acting is unimpressive the tone is wildly uneven and the plot is terminally nonsensical. The movie is in short broken.Now if you dont trust my take; or are really really in the mood for a little Mark Wahlberg on a big screen; or are for any other reason planning to go see the movie you should stop reading here. Because what follows is not a review; its an autopsy. Broken City--which made a satisfyingly paltry 8.3 million over the long weekend--is a film of such narrative emotional and moral incoherence that it requires one to reconstruct not merely what went wrong but what actually happened. For that reason Im presenting essentially one long (illustrated) spoiler.Wahlberg plays Billy Taggart a New York cop who in the opening scenes beats a murder rap for shooting an acquitted-on-a-technicality rapist/murderer but is forced to resign quietly from the force. Fast forward seven years and hes now a private eye snapping photos of in flagrante spouses through bedroom windows. Hes approached by the corrupt incumbent mayor (Russell Crowe disconcertingly blond) who is in a tough race against a reformist challenger (Barry Pepper) and is convinced that his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair. He hires Billy to find out with whom before the story gets out and ruins his chances of reelection.The film consists of Billy pinballing off characters asking the wrong questions (or none at all) drawing inaccurate conclusions and getting that Wahlberg-y look of impenetrable befuddlement. Billy follows the mayors wife to an assignation with the chief of staff (Kyle Chandler) of the mayoral challenger(). He reports back to the mayor what hes found and shortly thereafter the chief of staff is found shot dead in the street. Billy has unwittingly set the man up to be murdered... But It turns out that the mayors wife and the opposing chief of staff werent having an affair. They were just extremely close longtime friends and somehow no one else in the movie was aware of their friendship. It will turn out that the chief of staff was having a secret affair but it was with his boss the mayoral challenger(). The mayors wife is having a secret affair too but its with another of the mayors political enemies() the police commissioner played by Jeffrey Wright. (It goes unremarked that Billy is too inept a private eye to uncover any of this.) But back to the mayors wife and the opposing chief of staff Though they werent sleeping together they were plotting against her husband who is involved in a crooked land deal involving the sale of community housing for billions of dollars. The problem is that although each describes the other as his/her ""source"" neither one has any actual evidence that would make the charge stick. The chief of staff was hoping to get this evidence from a younger man he mentored in college (James Ransone) who has a bad relationship with his abusive father (Griffin Dunne) a real-estate developer who is the mayors biggest financial supporter and also his secret business partner in the land deal. The film consists of Billy pinballing off these various characters asking the wrong questions (or in a few striking instances none at all) drawing inaccurate conclusions and getting that Wahlberg-y look of impenetrable befuddlement that was a specialty early in his career (Boogie Nights Three Kings etc.). Finally he stumbles upon the developers son who gives him the evidence he needs to nail the mayor. (Now given that Billy had been hired by the mayor to finger a political opponent who subsequently wound up murdered youd think he would have had enough evidence to cause some trouble already especially given that the police commissioner wants the mayor out of the picture. But no one really seems to consider this option.)Did you have trouble following this? So did I which is why I drew myself this visual aid (apologies for the quality) Alas I couldnt figure out a way to squeeze in the movies romantic subplot Billys girlfriend (Natalie Martinez) is the sister of the girl who was raped and murdered by the man Billy killed in retribution all those years earlier. Shes also an actress who is starring in an indie film which makes Billy uncomfortable because hes a tough New Yorker who doesnt like fey beret-wearing (literally) Hollywood types. Things go from bad to worse when he attends the movie premiere with his girlfriend and sees the sex scene that she performed in and assumes she must be fucking her costar and falls off the wagon and gets blind drunk and they break up. One imagines that theyll get back together or that his abrupt descent into alcoholism will have some negative consequence or narrative purpose but neither of these things happens either. The girlfriend never appears onscreen again and his extreme drinking doesnt seem to pose him any problems. At the end its abruptly suggested that he has a romantic future with his much-younger-seeming office assistant. So there you have it. Broken City too much nonsense to fit into a single diagram.

Most Popular Presented by Aaron Josefczyk / Reuters Why Trump Supporters Think Hell Win David Frum How the election looks to backers of the Republican nominee Perhaps the hardest thing to do in contemporary American politics is to imagine how the world looks from the other side. Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters North Carolinas Deliberate Disenfranchisement of Black Voters David A. Graham A federal appeals court finds the impact of the states voting law can only be explained by ""discriminatory intent."" Updated on July 29 at 930 p.m. DURHAM N.C.--The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down key portions of North Carolinas strict 2013 voting law on Friday delivering a stern rebuke to the states Republican General Assembly and Governor Pat McCrory. The three-judge panel in Richmond Virginia unanimously concluded that the law was racially discriminatory and it blocked a requirement that voters show photo identification to vote and restored same-day voter registration a week of early voting pre-registration for teenagers and out-of-precinct voting.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

As Hurricane Katrina raged through New Orleans in 2005 neighborhood after neighborhood collapsed from flooding. Of the houses that stood many still had to be bulldozed due to mold within the walls. But one building a plantation-home-turned-museum on Moss Street built two centuries before the disaster was left almost entirely unscathed. ""The Pitot house was built the old way with plaster walls"" says Steve Mouzon an architect who helped rebuild the city after the hurricane. ""When the flood came the museum moved the furniture upstairs. Afterwards they simply hosed the walls--no harm done."" The other houses werent built the old way. ""All the homes around the Pitot house were lost because they were built with drywall"" says Mouzon. Continue Reading Reuters Trump Time Capsule 63 Whats In the Tax Returns? James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Graham The State Department is reopening its investigation into Hillary Clintons emails just as she puts a Justice Department investigation behind her. Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

But if ""Broken City"" - the first film to be directed solo by Allen Hughes one-half of the Hughes Brothers directing team - is a little flawed and cracked itself it still squeaks by as a reasonably thoughtful piece of big-screen entertainment. The picture comes out swinging with both a conscience and a set of brass knuckles; it also features a Russell Crowe who doesnt thankfully sing. Whats not to love? Mark Wahlberg stars as Billy Taggart a scrappy New York City cop whos been pushed out of the force after a controversial shooting on the grounds of a public housing complex called Bolton Village. He makes ends meet barely as a private investigator though he and his trusty smart-ass assistant Katy (Alona Tal) spend far too much of their time chasing down nonpaying clients. Thats why Billy is delighted to take a big-money assignment from his old pal Mayor Hostetler (Crowe) a slick old-school charmer who believes his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is cheating on him. It also happens to be election time and Hostetler hopes his principled man-of-the-people opponent the appropriately named Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) wont unseat him. Whats more Hostetler is in the middle of wheeler-dealering a multimillion deal to sell Bolton Village to a private-equity firm an arrangement that he swears will ""improve the lives"" of the complexs residents. As if. The cartoonish excess of ""Broken City"" is part of the fun although Hughes and first-time screenwriter Brian Tucker do have their feet planted in the here and now The picture borrows heavily from our recent real-life pre-election debates about the disparity between the haves and the have-nots - as well as the same-sex marriage issue -- and theres no doubt about where the picture stands politically. And yet Hughes prevents the whole affair from coming off as preachy. If ""Broken City"" is essentially a social-issues picture its also one with a healthy dose of grim shootings and rampant head bashing. This is Hughes first film since the 2010 ""The Book of Eli"" which he co-directed with his twin brother Albert. (The duo made their debut at the tender age of 20 with the 1993 ghetto-hustler picture ""Menace II Society."") The movie has a stylish gritty look although at times Hughes and cinematographer Ben Seresin seem to be trying too hard indulging in unnecessary circular pans just because they can. But its fun to watch this cast particularly Wahlberg Even though he plays almost nothing but cops these days he still brings a surprising blast of regular-guy energy to this role. A scene in which he melts down in the presence of his actress girlfriends hoity-toity ""metrosexual"" actor pals may be mildly overplayed - but then havent there been times when you wanted to punch the lights out of the smug guy at the end of the table wearing a fedora? Jeffrey Wright shows up in a righteous turn as the citys police commissioner and Zeta-Jones struts onto the scene in a series of luxurious wrap-around coats That dame just looks like money and thats as it should be. Crowe may be having the most fun of all packing fat rolls of villainy and greed into this bespoke suit of a performance. He saunters through ""Broken City"" as if he owned the place just as the corrupt Mayor Hostetler believes he owns the city of New York. The performance is too much but there are times when too much is just right. ""Broken City"" is a movie about a city in transition. Its a place where not even the good guys are always so good but the fat cat at the top is Public Enemy Number One.

Broken City a dark-side-of-New York suspense mystery about a private eye (Mark Wahlberg) hired by the citys mayor (Russell Crowe) to trail the mayors unfaithful wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) wants to be both kinds of thrillers at once. No wonder it ends up tying itself in knots. For a while though the first feature to be directed solo by Allen Hughes (of the Hughes brothers) is kind of fun as we go along with the entertainingly anachronistic idea of a sleazy-likable film-noir detective peering through window panes with his telephoto lens as he searches for sordid clues to adultery. Wahlbergs Billy Taggart has even been given an old-style Girl Friday (Alona Tal) and Crowe so tanned and coiffed that he looks like he belongs on a copper coin plays the mayor as a boss out of the 40s a heartless string-puller who thinks he owns the city. The movie takes place during the week leading up to the mayoral election and wouldnt you know it the mayors wife is having some sort of liaison with the other candidates campaign manager. Im sorry but thats the sort of plot twist that sets off an alarm bell in me. It says ""Warning overly tidy and insular scenario of corruption coming"" Then theres a very high-profile murder at which point the floodgates of contrivance really open. Broken City teases us with intimations of the lurid but its true subject is greed and the ruthlessness of companies that will lie through their teeth for profit. It seems that the principal issue dividing the two candidates is where they stand on a real-estate deal -- the selling of Bolton Village a gargantuan apartment complex to a private corporation. Crowes cynical sharpie backs the deal; his progressive opponent (Barry Pepper) thinks it will end up screwing the tenants. What I kept wondering is Who cares? The intimations of bedroom shenanigans were a lot more fun than this pseudo-serious city-sociology scandal. Wahlberg who still has that youthful poker face acts with his usual lean and mean awareness. Billy is an ex-cop and recovering alcoholic with whats supposed to be a blue-collar chip on his shoulder and I was with him right up to the moment when he attends the premiere of an independent film starring his actress girlfriend (Natalie Martinez). He ends up going ballistic at the after-party all because she had a hot love scene with her co-star. For 10 minutes Billy gulps down whiskeys and turns into the Jake LaMotta of Raging Bull. But then just a scene later hes clean courtly Mark Wahlberg again making this one of the least convincing on-screen benders Ive seen. The rest of Broken City is filled out with amusing overacting. Barry Pepper so good as Bobby Kennedy in the criminally underrated miniseries The Kennedys here plays the liberal savior as a borderline hysteric and Crowe though he still rules the screen with his presence smacks his lips too much to leave you with any real doubt about his characters intentions. As the police commissioner Jeffrey Wright is the only actor in Broken City on speaking terms with the shrewd ambiguity of understatement. The big ""revelation"" feels like something out of an oh-so-topical Hollywood thriller from the 80s. The truth is that were way past being outraged by these sorts of Crimes of the One Percent not because they dont happen but because the real version is so much more interesting. B?

At area theaters. This time of year its often a bit aggravating to watch how the movie industry snubs us so-called ""fly-over"" states. They send their Oscar contenders into our multiplexes and arthouses after Jan. 1 after the conversation about whats best has been underway on the coasts since mid-December. But movies like the new crime thriller ""Broken City"" -- starring Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe -- have me rethinking that frustration. Thank goodness there are films of heft and heart only now making it onto local screens. It is not that ""Broken City"" -- boasting a cast worth big expectations -- is bad exactly. But it is deeply mediocre. When they say television dramas are getting the better of the movies this is the sort of middling outing that proves it. Set in a New York City clearly bereft of Mayor Michael Bloombergs patrician touch ""Broken City"" begins with police detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) standing on a dark street in a low-income housing complex. At his feet a dead man lies with a bullet hole in the middle of his forehead. Did Taggart shoot the suspect a rapist and murderer in cold blood? The crowds gathered outside city hall shout yes. The court finds otherwise. Still after a meeting with Mayor Hostetler (Crowe) and the chief of police (Jeffrey Wright) hes forced out. Seven years later hes got his own detective agency in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge complete with his own smart-talking Girl Friday named Katy (Alona Tal). And Mayor Hostetler is once again summoning him to his office this time to hire him to find out whom his wife is trysting with. Kyle Chandler portrays the man she meets with. Theres a certain haughtiness to the lovely Catherine Zeta-Jones that makes her a fine choice for the role of savvy political wife. But ""Broken City"" is not about amour or carnal desire. The name pretty much says it. ""Broken City"" is about a municipality hobbled by the love of power and money. The sale of a massive housing project figures prominently. Sadly Brian Tuckers script doesnt handle this with sufficient finesse. The movies revelations neither tweak our understanding of backroom alliances nor satisfy our appreciation of the neo-noir genre the movie partakes in. Crowes mayor is a throwback with an accent that doesnt quite ring true. Hes more a gloss on Chicagos one-time boss Richard J. Daley than New Yorks Ed Koch or even law-and-order guy Rudy Giuliani. Hosteler is steely smarmy but seldom nuanced. The way Crowe plays him its hard to imagine him getting elected once. Yet most of the action is set as hes days away from either winning a third term or losing to councilman Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). There are signs throughout the movie that people tried to fix what ails ""Broken City."" Director Allen Hughes who made his mark by tag-teaming movies with twin brother Albert Hughes choreographs an early sequence with Taggart making calls to collect on past due accounts that has great promise. And Wahlberg nicely improvises banter with girlfriend Natalie (Natalie Martinez) an aspiring actress about to celebrate her first starring role in an indie picture. Written by newcomer Tucker ""Broken City"" serves as a reminder that sometimes a crime thriller is too intricate for its own good. Despite flashes of occasional levity and hints at more complex ambitions ""Broken City"" is more boilerplate than hardboiled.

"Broken City (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Broken City (R) A little corruption goes a long way in the big city Mark Wahlberg in Broken City. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | cogleMiamiHerald.com1/17/2013 Editor rating 2 If nothing else Broken City manages to pull off a difficult feat Its too convoluted to follow and simultaneously too simplistic to be believed. Directed by Allen Hughes (Menace II Society Dead Presidents From Hell) and rather clumsily written by newcomer Brian Tucker the movie is a thriller that turns clunkier the more procedural it grows relying on coincidences and unlikely confessions that unravel any claims to gritty urban realism. What Broken City does have in its favor is the cast. Mark Wahlberg stars as Billy Taggart a disgraced New York cop on trial for the controversial shooting of an exonerated murder suspect. Taggarts case isnt going to court; there isnt enough evidence. But the citys calculating mayor (Russell Crowe) and enigmatic police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) tell Taggart they have a video indicating he acted inappropriately. Instead of turning over the information to the prosecution though the mayor -- a burly glad-handing man-of-the-people named Hostetler -- tells Taggart hell let it vanish if Taggart will resign all in the name of saving the department from scandal. Taggart reluctantly agrees and seven years later hes scrabbling together a living working as a private eye (one too soft-hearted to collect what hes owed from clients just to let you know hes essentially a good guy). One day he gets a call from the mayors office. Seems payback time has come. The mayor in the middle of a close political race against a younger yuppified candidate (Barry Pepper) wants to hire Taggart to follow his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Hostetler believes shes having an affair that will destroy his chance to remain in office New Yorkers being too finicky to vote for a cuckold though they will root for the Jets. Taggart takes the job -- the pay is good -- and discovers that Mrs. Hostetler seems to be canoodling with the opponents campaign manager (Kyle Chandler). Broken City is one of those movies in which characters keep reminding you that nothing is what it seems and sure enough theres more going on here than mere infidelity. But the audience is hard-pressed to follow exactly what it is. The main problem is that whats at stake is not terribly inflammatory when you consider some of the political debacles of the past decades. The scandal from which all the violence erupts doesnt really seem like something that would cause tough politicos to opt for murder. And the resolution which rides on some highly questionable events -- like Taggart showing up in exactly the right place just as the bad guys are throwing crucial secrets into a dumpster instead of shredding them -- is patently ridiculous. Crowe though reminds us how effective he can be as Hostetler (after his much-maligned turn as the singing Javert in Les Miserables thats probably a good thing). With his false bonhomie Jersey Shore spray tan and dead shark eyes hes a menacing portrait of corruption. Wahlberg is good too as the working-class hero whos made plenty of his own mistakes but hopes to do a good deed in the end and Alona Tal (Veronica Mars) makes a terrific impression as Taggarts loyal office assistant even when shes stuck with lines like ""Sing Sing aint no place for guys with good hearts."" Still theyre not enough to put all the pieces of Broken City back together again. Cast Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe Catherine Zeta-Jones Jeffrey Wright Barry Pepper Kyle Chandler Alona Tal.

A strong cast in a knotty plot about conniving politicians cant keep this drama from splintering By Richard Corliss Jan. 18 2013 Share Read Later Barry Wetcher/20th Century Fox Broken City Year 2013 Director Allen Hughes Studio Twentieth Century Fox Actors Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe Catherine Zeta-Jones Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture In films about municipal corruption all politics is marsupial every office holder is in a plutocrats pocket. That brand of cynicism wafted through last weeks Gangster Squad in which a posse of rogue-cop heroes applied a blood colonic to postwar L.A. Now the misanthropy gets sprayed like Pepe LePews perfume all over Broken City. The city is New York more or less; Mayor Nicolas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) holds the towns big steel balls in his hand; and the agents of reform are outmaneuvered at every turn by some very smooth malefactors. The third crime drama in an unusually ambitious slate of Jan. films -- and the third to costar an Oscar winner for Best Actor with Crowe (Gladiator) joining Gangster Squads Sean Penn (Mystic River Milk) and The Last Stands Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) -- Broken City also boasts a leading man and a director with imposing early-winter credentials. Mark Wahlberg a star in any month headlined Contraband the top-grossing picture of last Jan. And behind the camera is Allen Hughes who with his twin brother Albert directed Denzel Washington in the 2010 Book of Eli a futuristic drama about political corruption that was by a long stretch the best Jan. movie of the last few years. (READ Corlisss review of Book of Eli) So Broken City stokes a lot of hopes. Too bad for all of us the makers and the watchers alike that its a grimy botch. Running for a second term the Mayor finds himself in a tight race with Ivy League do-gooder rival Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). But he has time to hire detective Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) to see if his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones -- Jeez another Oscar winner) is having an affair with Valliants campaign manager Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler) whom Billy tracks out to an assignation with Cathleen in Montauk. Billy resigned from the N.Y.P.D. seven years ago after killing a young man; ever since from guilt or love he has sworn off drinking and cared for the boys pretty sister Natalie (Natalie Martinez) an aspiring actress. The scene of the shooting was Bolton Village a crime-ridden project that the Mayor has sold off to Wall Street investors. He brags the deal will bring 4 billion to the City; it may also line the pockets of the men whose pockets hes in. (READ Josh Tyrangiels 2003 profile of Russell Crowe) Brian Tuckers screenplay is within genuflecting distance of Serpico Prince of the City and other gritty-good New York films directed by Sidney Lumet. But while appreciating the sewer-level view of Gothams powerful a viewer often stops to ask for example whether a Mayor has the authority to privatize public housing. And why five days before a close election Andrews would rendezvous with Cathleen at the end of a three-hour-plus train ride to Montauk. (Couldnt they have met in Mineola? Youre there and back in about an hour.) Also why Andrews candidate would bear a cartoon-hero name as instantly suspicious as say Lance Armstrong? And why if Valliant were really running for Mayor and not for Star he wouldnt get a haircut since in his current luxurious coiff he looks like the posh villain on a soap opera. The only mystery thats easily resolved is why the movie gives the New York Post about a quillion plugs Rupert Murdoch whose 20th Century Fox distributes Broken City also owns the Post. (READ TIMEs tribute to the films of Sidney Lumet) The plot incongruities are the least of Broken Citys problems. What might have been sharp on paper plays flat on screen. Its as if the films editor had been given two versions of every scene one sizzling and the other sloppy and mistakenly chose all of the bad takes. The mandatory mid-movie car chase and fist fight -- Tom Cruise felt obliged to include one or more of each in Jack Reacher yet another recent wallow in cops-and-pols corruption -- are staged inexpertly. In a movie drowning in lost opportunities a few heads bob above the surface. As the police chief Jeffrey Wright whos almost always too good for the movies hes in and the roles he plays lets intelligence peek through the veil of his characters motivations. Israeli actress Alona Tal as Billys sassy assistant lays on the working-girl mannerisms like a trowel but lends her moments a desperately needed vitality. (READ Corliss review of Jack Reacher) Billy for all his sleuthing spends most of this picture as the pawn of the powerful the way Jack Nicholsons Jake Gittes did in Chinatown the golden template for urban-corruption films. Still Wahlberg should dominate Broken City. The Boston native has done well playing sensitive urban bruiser types -- think a lumpen Matt Damon -- and here hes the producer and star in a part that suits him. Yet in a perplexing combustion of anti-chemistry nothing happens. Could it be that Allen Hughes brother Albert with whom he directed all his previous features was the brains of the pair? Wahlberg might have gone instead to James Gray whose Brooklyn-set crimes dramas The Yards and We Own the Night (both with Wahlberg) have a more pungent sense of the Citys grand venality. Then again searching for reasons for a movie misfire is a fruitless endeavor. When any film works its a miracle; when it doesnt its this. (READ Mary Pols on Mark Wahlberg in Contraband) One last question Why was this Noo Yawkiest of movies shot mostly in New Orleans? These days it seems every R-rated melodrama no matter what the putative setting is made in Louisiana Django Unchained Looper 21 Jump Street Killer Joe Killing Them Softly and The Paperboy plus Wahlbergs own Contraband both of The Expendableses and Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter with more to come (Bullet to the Head Sin City 2). Is it the lure of Creole cooking or the fabulous tax incentives offered by the state? Some investigative screenwriter should look into this. He might find if only in his imagination the bodies of film commissioners from rival states at the bottom of a bayou. And that piece of fiction properly filmed would make a more savory thriller than this spindled Broken City.

(FOX) Hes an ex-cop mostly doing ""matrimonial work"" -- window-peeping but with a P.I. license a ready camera and a suspicious spouse writing the checks. Then a particularly connected cuckold hires him. Except maybe what hes investigating goes a little deeper than no-tell motels. Maybe hes the one being played for a sap. You see Jake may have finally forgotten ""Chinatown."" But no self-respecting screenwriter ever has and there are more than a few glimmers of it in the slightly familiar but mostly fun ""Broken City."" Mark Wahlberg plays the private eye a disgraced NYC policeman whose career was saved by Russell Crowe the big bare-knuckled boss of a mayor. But seven years after the favor hizzoner comes calling Seems his wife isnt always where she should be.... Of course Wahlberg finds out theres more to it than that. And as usual it involves power and money and the people who are willing to kill to preserve one and get more of the other. Although the film is set during the present few of its elements are new or treated very freshly. Director Allen Hughes clearly loves the old tropes -- old Sidney Lumet films too judging from the movies burnished mahogany interiors - but they feel like things from other pictures not observations from life. Sure Wahlberg has a plucky and devoted secretary -- but she never really convinces as a sassy girl from the neighborhood. And he has a drinking problem -- but only when the script needs him to have one. Yet Hughes - who started out with his brother Albert bringing Scorsese style to gangsta flicks like ""Dead Presidents"" and ""Menace II Society"" -- does have a real feel for New York as does the script by first timer Brian Tucker. (Although someone should tell the filmmakers you catch the LIRR out of Penn not Grand Central.) Theres mischief to the movie too. (Released by Fox it dutifully namechecks the companys Post but has its hero reading the rival Daily News and names one bad guy ""Murdock""). Some of the attitudes are pitch-perfect. (The mayor likes posing with hero cops because ""Then I can win Staten Island without ever having to set foot in it."") And Hughes gets a lot out of his actors. Wahlberg doesnt do much more than channel his inner guilty Catholic schoolboy but thats what the character requires. And Catherine Zeta-Jones is marvelous (if sometimes too gauzily photographed) as the cheating wife. Best is Russell Crowe as the mayor. From ""L.A. Confidential"" to ""Les Miserables"" Crowes strongest suit has always been his sense of pained incomprehension; even when he played a genius in ""A Beautiful Mind"" it was his hopeless confusion that drove it. But here he abandons his usual dumb wounded animal look to play crafty. His grinning backslapping spray-tanned New York mayor may not be the straightest nail in the box. But never doubt hes the sharpest and the likeliest to get the job done. Its a nice surprise from an actor whos been content for too long to stick to one or two moods just as ""Broken City"" - it sounds like a Springsteen B-side doesnt it? -- is a more-than-pleasant change from the months parade of horror films and trash comedies. Yeah its a long way from ""Chinatown."" But unlike the loud bang-bang ""Gangster Squad"" at least it knows the neighborhood. Ratings note The film contains strong language violence and alcohol abuse. Broken City (R) Fox (109 min.) Directed by Allen Hughes. With Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe Catherine Zeta-Jones. Now playing in New Jersey.

To put it as positively as possible theres never a dull moment in this flick -- and thats not something you can take for granted at this time of the year. At the same time though theres rarely a believable moment in the script credited to first-time screenwriter Brian Tucker. For starters Hizzoner has wiped out a billion-dollar budget deficit by selling a Brooklyn public housing project for 4 billion() to a ""Wall Street equity firm. Crowes corrupt vaguely Giuliani-esque mayor is running behind in the polls in his bid for a third term despite this ""coup. (Of course in the real world selling a housing project would probably be political suicide in this city). But Hizzoner still finds time to put on his best sweater and send for Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg complete with Boston accent) a Brooklyn ex-cop with a dark past-turned-struggling private detective. Billy is paid to follow the mayors unfaithful wife (an imperious Catherine Zeta-Jones) and identify whos cuckolding him because the citys chief exec argues this will somehow benefit him politically. Sure and if you believe that this mayor (who could simply have asked his wifes police security detail to clue him in) has a bridge in Brooklyn hell sell you for 3 billion. Its obviously a setup and theres very little surprise when the ostensible lover (Kyle Chandler) -- who just happens to be campaign manager for a Bloombergian billionaire (Barry Pepper) electoral challenger -- turns up dead with Billy holding the bag. Theres lots more convoluted plot where that comes from plus a back story for Billy that doesnt begin to make sense. Seven years earlier our hero was forced to leave the NYPD after fatally shooting a rapist-murderer who went free on a technicality. But Billy himself escaped conviction after the mayor and his police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) conspired to suppress evidence against Billy. Got that? Plus poor Billy is a recovering alcoholic whos in a fraying relationship with an actress (Natalie Martinez) whos the sister of the rapist-murderer. And Billys shocked shocked that she has a sex scene in her dreadful new indie movie which is titled (I am not making this up) ""Kiss of Life a play on the famous film noir ""Kiss of Death. The other woman in Billys life is his Gal Friday played by Alona Tal who nearly steals the film in a scene where shes threatening Billys deadbeat customers on the phone. Under the circumstances its only petit larceny. Theres no shortage of incriminating evidence red herrings or car chases in a film where Big Apple scenes are largely filmed in the Big Easy. And its handled with uh competence in first solo effort by director Allen Hughes whos worked as a team with his brother Albert going back to the far superior ""Menace II Society (1993). But theres only so much you can do to suppress titters at a mayoral debate where the bellowing Hostetler turns up wearing so much man-tan that he looks like hes running for mayor of Beverly Hills. Among the films other more hilarious moments are the revelation of the actual identity of the mayors wifes lover not to mention the other mayoral candidates lover. It would be criminal to give them away. And yes its less painful to watch Crowe ordering the commissioner ""I want heads to roll for this than listening to him singing in ""Les Miserables. As far as Im concerned it may be worth seeing ""Broken City just to see the citys mayor refer to the New York Times as an ""upscale tabloid after it publishes a critical editorial. Not that Im recommending you pay full price.

Starring Russell Crowe Mark Wahlberg Catherine Zeta-Jones Kyle Chandler Barry Pepper Justin Chambers Alona Tal Natalie Martinez Jeffrey Wright William Ragsdale Director Allen Hughes Running time 149 Release Opened Jan 18 2013  Editorial Review No witness protection programBy Stephanie MerryFriday January 18 2013Aside from the Oscar holdovers in early January this months film releases typically are a sad lot. You may want to account for low expectations but the crime drama ""Broken City"" turns out to be much better -- and funnier and more suspenseful -- than both trailer and release date portend. Director Allen Hughes who usually works with his twin brother Albert on such movies as ""Dead Presidents"" and ""Menace II Society"" may be flying solo but he brings all the intensity of his past features. Mark Wahlberg plays Billy Taggart a New York cop forced to hand in his badge and gun after being involved in the shooting death of a teenager. The mayor (Russell Crowe) tells Billy his actions were heroic. But the citys residents are outraged over the violence and Billys law enforcement career must end. Seven years after his resignation the former police officer makes a living tailing and photographing cheating spouses. Its not much but it pays the bills at least when Billys clients remember to pay which isnt often. So 50000 for an easy job might seem like a god-sent windfall. Just before Election Day Mayor Hostetler -- running neck and neck with his opponent Jack Valliant -- contacts Billy. It appears that the mayors wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is cheating on him and he wants pictures and information (including some unsavory details) about the man whos cuckolding him. The job of course is not quite as straightforward as it seems; its a mere thread in a web of political corruption revolving around the campaign and the sale of a public housing complex linked to Billys mysterious past. Billy could just walk away 50000 richer but that would be a lot less thrilling than taking on the creepy orange-faced misogynistic and homophobic mayor. This villain not to mention the crooked story trajectory could come across as over-the-top but a few elements help ground the film not the least of which is humor. As Wahlberg demonstrated in ""The Departed"" the man can deliver a solid punch line. Even when his character seems to take himself too seriously the movie generally doesnt going so far as winking at the audience when Billy becomes fed up with the confusion of neverending plot twists. Thankfully most of those sharp turns develop organically adding intrigue without outlandishness. One of the twists revolves around Billys nature. Is he a protagonist worth pulling for? The full picture of Billys intentions and actions the night of the career-ending shooting are revealed slowly over the course of the film and that mystery serves as an effective hook. The cast across the board feels expertly chosen. Crowe proves hes an especially effective villain when singing isnt involved and Wahlberg lands his zingers with a nice deadpan. But the ancillary characters really stand out buoyed by such actors as Jeffrey Wright as the standoffish all-business police commissioner and Barry Pepper as Jack Valliant the floppy-haired Harvard-educated mayoral contender. The film gets bogged down with unnecessary complications in Billys love life and intimations of a budding relationship with his spitfire assistant. And there are a few too-convenient plot developments -- a nefarious corporation should know to shred its documents. But overall this is an entertaining diversion and not just compared with other first-month releases. Contains crude language violence and sexual situations.

Thats how I felt at the end of Broken City a needlessly long ill-conceived film about corruption at the highest level of New York City politics. Mark Wahlberg plays a cop who is used then discarded by the Mayor (Russell Crowe) and Police Commissioner (Jeffrey Wright). Seven years later working as a low-end private eye he gets a call from that same slick glad-handing mayor asking him to investigate his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whos supposedly having an affair. Something isnt kosher about all of this but Wahlberg cant put his finger on it. What can you say about a story that takes so long to unfold but doesnt take the time to flesh out its characters? These people are strictly cardboard and some of them (like Wahlbergs wife played by Natalie Martinez whose work as an actress makes him jealous) are ciphers. Theres a certain novelty value in watching Crowe with a curious hairstyle playing a dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker but it wears off fairly soon. As for the ""secret"" carrot thats repeatedly dangled in front of us screenwriter Brian Tucker and director Allen Hughes seem to think its a powerhouse. I beg to differ. Broken City is a waste of time and talent...an all-too-typical big studio January release.

By Cary Darlingdfw.comPosted 109am on Friday Jan. 18 2013 Friday Jan. 18 2013 Thursday Jan. 17 2013 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram Sometimes the trailer is the best thing about a movie. Other times it doesnt do the film justice making it seem far more routine than it really is.Such is the case with Broken City which looks like just another urban thriller with Mark Wahlberg flexing his usual ""you-talkin-to-me?"" East Coast attitude. The reality is that while Broken City is hardly revolutionary its a slyly entertaining cop saga that leans more heavily on acting and dialogue than gunplay and chases.Wahlberg is Billy Taggart a New York City detective who left the force under a cloud seven years ago after a high-profile shooting. Now hes a low-rent private eye who has been reduced to taking incriminating photos of wayward spouses. To add financial insult to career injury he then has to hound his loutish clients to get paid.So when the pugnacious mayor (Russell Crowe) summons Billy to his office says he thinks the citys first lady (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has been playing around and offers him 50000 to come up with the goods hes more than happy to take the job. But the payday soon turns into a nightmare as Billy realizes that what seemed like a simple love triangle is really a complex web of political corruption and civic chicanery.As directed by Allen Hughes -- in his first film that he didnt co-direct with brother Albert (The Book of Eli Dead Presidents and Menace II Society) -- Broken City feels more in the spirit of a gumshoe classic of a previous era. People have real conversations the puzzle at the heart of the plot is genuinely intriguing and Wahlberg and Crowe -- who thankfully isnt called on to sing -- turn in strong performances as their relationship shifts from cordial to hostile.The script written by newcomer Brian Tucker also includes some welcome touches of light humor often provided by the jokey relationship Billy has with his assistant Katy (Alona Tal Supernatural).Certainly Broken City is no Chinatown with which it shares some storyline similarities. But it also doesnt devolve into predictable action and easy resolutions which gives it a leg up on its multiplex competition.Now it just needs a new trailer.Cary Darling 817-390-7571Twitter carydar Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

Opens Friday nationwide 3 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMOREBroken City is in serious need of repair.And with all the talent involved its all the more disappointing. Allen Hughes directs aiming for a gritty political thriller. But aiming is not achieving. Few if any of the characters are believable and the twists the story takes are telegraphed well beforehand or fairly guessable. Much of the plot gets bogged down with excess exposition.Mark Wahlberg plays a role that feels exceedingly familiar -- both for him and for this kind of predictable saga of corruption. Hes Billy Taggart a zealous but boozy New York City cop who takes the law into his own hands-- and gets away with murder. Hes quietly booted off the force but not imprisoned. Hes lauded as a hero by the sleazy mayor (Russell Crowe) then kicked out of the department by Police Commissioner Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright). We knew in seconds that Crowes Mayor Hostetler is slimy. Its evident at first sight with his aura of power-grabbing menace bad haircut and fake tan (which grows darker over the movies course particularly during a mayoral campaign debate).The story mostly takes place seven years after Taggarts firing. Now a struggling private eye he has sobered up and coupled with Natalie (Natalie Martinez). Taggart has avenged the rape and death of her sister and their relationship hinges on that. Natalie is an actress making her first indie film and Taggart is not supportive for no particular reason. He then grows ridiculously jealous watching her in a love scene with a co-star in a subplot that goes nowhere.The bigger story focuses on the venal mayor and his elegant wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The mayor hires Taggart to spy on her because he says shes cheating on him. He offers Taggart a tidy sum. Along the way we see a lot of banal bantering between Taggart and his youthful assistant Katy (Alona Tal). And then there are the dull clashes of Mayor Hostetler and his idealistic challenger councilman Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). Also key to the story are a real estate developer and top campaign contributor (Griffin Dunne) and Valliants campaign manager (Kyle Chandler).The dialogue is often cliched which undercuts the sense of treachery the film tries to establish. Director Hughes posits too many unlikely scenarios and far-fetched coincidences for this tale to work. For instance at the very moment Taggart arrives at a company he suspects of corruption he sees workers throwing trash bags of evidence in a garbage bin. And a key incriminating contract mystifyingly is never shredded unlike all the other documents that are being tossed out.Were meant to root for Taggart as he stands up to a corrupt system. But after he falls off the wagon and behaves like a fool its hard to really care as he is railroaded framed double-crossed and more.Wahlberg had one of his best screen roles last year with Seth MacFarlanes rowdy comedy Ted. He has great comic timing and perhaps should focus his energies on more humorous parts. His flawed-cop roles are played out. Hes far more compelling when riffing with a potty-mouthed teddy bear than tangling with a corrupt mayor.Sure Ted and Broken City are cinematic apples and oranges but freshness is key in all genres. A cynical thriller about governmental corruption should not make cynics of its audience. 3 CONNECTTWEET 1 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/101UmKU,http://rssfeeds.usatoday.com/~r/UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories/~3/dfgtJm7FccA/,200,brokencity20,brokencity,usatoday
"Review Broken City loses its way - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview Broken City loses its wayThe film bogs down in political machinations and largely wastes lead actors Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe.January 17 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Brian Tuckers ""Broken City"" screenplay is packed with plot twists complex sentences and the kind of innuendo that make it seem as if the movie will be a smarter-than-most thriller from the first exchanges. All the talking is no doubt why ""Broken City"" landed on the coveted Black List of the best unproduced scripts a few years ago.Now its been filmed with a beefy cast led by Mark Wahlberg as Billy Taggart a broken cop turned P.I. Russell Crowe is cagey Mayor Nicolas Hostetler the man who brought him down. Jeffrey Wright as Police Commissioner Fairbanks watches it all with a jaundiced eye.The hook in ""Broken City"" set in a modern-day New York where political corruption and police intrigue pile up like garbage during a strike is that nothing is what it seems. The movie proves to be a bait-and-switch of a different sort.FULL COVERAGE Movie reviewsDirector Allen Hughes who usually does gritty city quite well has given ""Broken City"" the look of a noir and the mayor a Prince Valiant do which along with the quandaries a a real estate scam a reelection campaign and a cheating wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) a keep the pot boiling. But it also makes the film feel dated as if everything might play better if this were the 1950s or better still the 1920s. Real-life corruption and betrayals have gotten so much more byzantine in a new-age techno-centric kind of way.Though the film starts with Billys downfall a a questionable shooting with Billy literally holding a smoking gun a it quickly shifts into his redemption phase. The story picks up a few years into it with the former cop trying to do the right thing in a seedy business.The bulk of his private-eyeing entails snapping compromising shots of adulterous wives. Still hes got his integrity his sobriety a feisty young office manager (Alona Tal) and a beautiful girlfriend (Natalie Martinez). But hes going bankrupt all the same. An unexpected call from his old nemesis the mayor comes with the promise of a 50000 payment for catching his wife in the act. It is hard to refuse though his gut tells him he should.Watching everything unfold I was reminded of Gene Hackmans surveillance guy in ""The Conversation"" and William Hurts toyed-with lover in ""Body Heat"" both brilliant executions of the rat-in-the-maze game that ""Broken"" purports to be. Unlike those earlier brain teases a so intense its hard to breathe a Hughes has allowed the high wire everyone is walking to go slack. All the danger that characterized his groundbreaking 1993 cult hit ""Menace II Society"" written and directed with twin brother Albert is missing. As a result the double crosses lack punch the threats sound empty. Plot twists that should be kept under wraps are telegraphed so far ahead of time that little about ""Broken City"" comes as a surprise.In part the problem lies in whose story this really is a Billys or the mayors. Since no one seems willing to make the call the movie keeps shifting between the two a sometimes connecting the dots between them sometimes not. Its anyones game.The director lets the dreary dirty business of political ambition drone on a there is almost as much campaign footage on screen as we saw last year a although Crowe does pull off a political debate against his opponent Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) quite handily. The actor is stinging enough and winning enough in that particular face-off that its hard not to hope that he will find a role he can really sink his teeth into before too much longer. Maybe Crowe needs to be a hero rather than a villain a its where he has done his best work whether the Oscar win for ""Gladiator"" or the way he rose to the cerebral challenge of ""A Beautiful Mind.""FULL COVERAGE 2013 Movie sneaksThe film presents a different set of issues for Wahlberg. He is one of those actors so easy to like in nearly everything he does that ""Broken"" comes as a rare disappointment. Wahlbergs comeback boxer in ""The Fighter"" had such vulnerability and heart you were in his corner from the first frame. His cop in ""The Departed"" was so completely torn up by the moral dilemmas you ached along with him. He even found a way to make the bond between his slacker guy and a potty-mouth plush toy in ""Ted"" endearing and believable.But Billy confounds him. The films moral turning point comes with Billys discovery that something about his gig for the mayor doesnt smell right. It begins to haunt him pulling up memories of his own downfall. But all the snares set along the way stop making sense. The conflict between Billy and his girlfriend a promising indie actress feels particularly forced and the tailspin that follows a complete fraud.Walhbergs Billy isnt so much bad as just not there a nothing clicks nothing resonates everythings broken.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO The making of Argo Les Miz and more ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSale brings pain and gain to Mark WahlbergOctober 13 2013Mark Wahlberg finally sells his Beverly Hills-area mansionOctober 2 2013Horror movie Mama to top new Schwarzenegger Wahlberg...January 17 2013Allen Hughes helms Broken City solo a new direction for...January 12 2013Mark Wahlberg does traffic weather reports on Philly TV...January 9 2013MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowFilmMark WahlbergMovieCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-broken-city-review-20130118,0,3798615.story",200,brokencity21,brokencity,latimes
"Broken City movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The purr of power in Broken City  1/2 Broken City review for ndn Mark Wahlberg stars in Broken City. But the show?s stolen by somebody else. Review by Michael Phillips. Mark Wahlberg stars in Broken City. But the show?s stolen by somebody else. Review by Michael Phillips. Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In ""Broken City"" a Manhattan-set drama likely to appeal to those who enjoyed the more elegantly plotted machinations of ""Arbitrage"" the scenes between Russell Crowe as a powerful New York City mayor and Jeffrey Wright as the equally powerful police commissioner offer a special kind of satisfaction.Its a war of the sinister murmurs. Throughout director Allen Hughes film taken from a script by Brian Tucker Crowe keeps his voice down to a conversational growl as his character wages a re-election campaign driven by a billion-dollar real estate deal whose details remain cloaked in film noir-level shadows. Then Crowe meets his match and his most wily nemesis A little while into ""Broken City"" Wright enters the story (the bad blood between the characters goes way back) and this inspired actor the actor with the most insinuating voice in contemporary American movies actually out-growls Crowe out-murmurs the master murmurer.Mark Wahlberg is the star of the film and he does pretty well too. A disgraced former cop his character Billy lives with an actress (Natalie Martinez) trades banter with his Gal Friday (Alona Tal) while making a living as a private detective hiding behind bushes with his camera. Then the mayor hires him to tail his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whom the mayor suspects of having an affair. Evidence gathered by Billy points to the campaign manager (Kyle Chandler) of the mayors rival candidate (Barry Pepper) as the guilty party. If that were true ""Broken City"" would be a 45-minute film which it isnt. For an hour or so aided by the autumnal glow of Ben Seresins cinematography director Hughes maintains a firm handle on the storys turnabouts. Then the script goes a little nuts with coincidence and improbability and Billy turns into an audience surrogate forced to repeat variations on the line ""Will someone tell me whats going on here?""Its frustrating because the cast is so natty and ready for action. Screenwriter Tucker writes some nice tough profane dialogue. Right at the end (no spoilers here dont panic just calm down) Wrights commissioner slides a final insult in the direction of his longtime political enemy and the audience loves it. If only the line and Wrights delivery of it didnt come at the tail end of so much knotty confusion and so many awkward expositional back flips Theres more to screenwriting than the zingers as Tucker no doubt found out writing ""Broken City.""Luckily theres also more to a film than whats on the page. There is for example the fun of seeing Crowe and Wright have at each other without raising their voices above a threatening purr.mjphillipstribune.comBroken City -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for pervasive language some sexual content and violence)Running time 149Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Politics and Government Movies Elections Board of Directors Barry Pepper Kyle Chandler 10 movies to see this winter Michael Phillips predicts the Oscars Top 50 superhero movies of the last 10 years Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising71deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0116-broken-city-20130117,0,5754514.column",200,brokencity22,brokencity,chicagotribune

A drug cartel leader busts out of a courthouse and speeds to the Mexican border where the only thing in his path is a sheriff (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his inexperienced staff. (Photo/Video Lionsgate) By Joe Morgenstern Updated Jan. 17 2013 612 p.m. ET First he was the Terminator then the Governator. Now Arnold Schwarzenegger has cast himself as the Rejuvenator breathing huffs and puffs of new life into his screen career. Much of ""The Last Stand"" is a wheezy setup for an enjoyably preposterous showdown in a sleepy Arizona border town called Sommerton Junction. Thats where the sheriff Mr. Schwarzeneggers Ray Owens represents this nations last hope of stopping its most-wanted fugitive a Mexican drug-cartel kingpin who is driving toward the border at barely subsonic speeds. The main source of dramatic energy is the fugitives ride a modified Corvette with a 1000-horsepower engine. Still the movie comes up with a couple of tender moments that could pass for human and a mano-a-mano climax in which the superhero of yore the glint in his eye dulled but not extinguished functions as a weirdly touching tyrannosaurus. ENLARGE Arnold Schwarzenegger Lionsgate In celebration of Arnold Schwarzeneggers return to the big screen in a starring role with Lionsgates ""The Last Stand"" here are some of our favorite Arnold one-liners from over the years. (Photo Columbia Pictures) The best way to see this munitions-intensive action adventure if you must see it at all is in the context of a shrewd commercial enterprise. The production is far from lavish. Sequences play out in sub-TV settings; even Las Vegas where the villain Gabriel Cortez ( Eduardo Noriega) escapes from his FBI captors has more than its share of empty streets and blank walls. That said the action component pays off with ritual car chases (in the context of product placements they come down to the black Vette versus a red Chevy Camaro); heavy weaponry such as a World War II Vickers machine gun from a historical-weapons museum that happens to be situated in Sommerton Junctions sandy outskirts and a reasonably buoyant spirit that pits the drug lord Goliath with his small army of tactical support troops against Mr. Schwarzeneggers long-in-the-tooth David. ""The Last Stand"" marks the English-language debut of the Korean director Kim Jee-woon whose eye for graphic action is more reliable than his ear for English nuance; the ponderous pacing of dialogue scenes and the frequency of barely audible lines suggest that the actors were on their own. But the movie isnt about eloquence its about giving Mr. Schwarzenegger a chance to take on new enemies that include advancing age. Johnny Knoxville is likable as the goofy proprietor of the weapons museum and the script provides such agreeably sententious nonsense as the kingpins comment to a terrified hostage in the passenger seat when he puts the Corvettes pedal to the metal. ""Death"" he tells her ""is waiting in the kitchen when you get up at night for a glass of milk."" Watch a clip from the film ""Mama."" Annabel (Jessica Chastain) and Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) are faced with the challenge of raising his young nieces that were left alone in the forest for 5 years. But how alone were they? (Photo/Video Universal) Mama The Mama of this supernatural thriller is not your average nurturer while ""Mama"" itself is above average as a piece of filmmaking even if its scare quotient is middling or below. Thats OK with me. I was content to be impressed by the skill of the first-time director Andres Muschietti; absorbed by the performances and smitten by some startling images. Its also OK that several characters keep asking one another if theyre OK. This gets to be a running gag in a film where no one is OK for a single moment--not young Victoria or younger Lilly two feral sisters who may have spent the last five years alone in a cabin in the woods; not their uncle Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who must now help care for them and certainly not Lucass wife Annabel a Goth rocker who becomes the childrens primary caregiver then finds herself engulfed by gothic horror. ENLARGE Megan Charpentier Universal Pictures ENLARGE Jessica Chastain Universal Pictures Annabel is played by Jessica Chastain though you might not know it at first thanks to her mop of black hair and abundant tattoos. Its no stretch to see a commonality between this no-nonsense bass player and Maya Ms. Chastains CIA operative in ""Zero Dark Thirty."" Like Maya Annabel combines fear with steely courage. She needs as much of the latter as she can summon up when Megan Charpentiers Victoria wide eyes peering out from behind wire spectacles and Isabelle Nelisses Lilly scuttling around on all fours turn out to have some sort of protean and wildly possessive guardian they choose to call Mama. ""Mama"" was produced by Guillermo del Toro the masterly Mexican director of such action fantasies as ""Mimic"" ""Hellboy"" and the memorably lyrical ""Pans Labyrinth."" This films Argentine director Mr. Muschietti wrote the script with his sister Barbara and Neil Cross; its an expansion of a surreal short that can be seen on YouTube. At times Mr. Muschietti seems to be the cinematic equivalent of an art student learning from the masters by copying them. Many of his tropes will be familiar to Mr. del Toros fans of whom I am one the difference being that the storytelling here can be confusing and the supernatural threat manifests itself in so many differing forms as to be diffuse and in horror terms defused. All the same ""Mama"" announces the arrival of a director who works unusually well with actors--the two children are truly scary--and who creates highly charged environments effective sound designs and powerful fantasy sequences. One irresistible parallel is not to Mr. del Toros work but to Francois Truffauts transcendently beautiful ""The Wild Child"" in which Truffaut himself played Dr. Itard the physician who undertook to civilize a feral boy discovered in the forests of 18th-century France. The doctor in ""Mama"" played by Daniel Kash is a psychologist and a shameless hustler. Academics can be feral too. --J.M. Watch a clip from the film ""Broken City."" Ex-cop Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) seeks redemption and revenge after being double-crossed and then framed by its most powerful figure Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe). (Photo/Video Fox) Broken City Theres no joy in the city of the title which isnt Mudville but a contemporary version of Sam Spades Manhattan tainted by the moral murk of Gotham City. The only reason to see this dreary parade of deception and venality is Mark Wahlbergs performance as a disgraced ex-cop caught up in the thick of menacing events he cant understand. Its striking how this tightly focused actor can find his own firmly grounded reality in the falsest of surroundings. ENLARGE Mark Wahlberg Twentieth Century Fox The film was directed lugubriously by Allen Hughes from a script that Brian Tucker recycled from livelier sources--the films of Sidney Lumet leap to mind. Mr. Wahlbergs Billy Taggart now a private eye struggling to make a living is retained by Mayor Hostetler a smug popinjay played by Russell Crowe. Billys task is to find out who the mayors wife Cathleen is sleeping with; shes played by Catherine Zeta-Jones who seems slightly disconsolate and no wonder. But Billys fate is to be used and confused by everyone around him including the citys police commissioner Carl Fairbanks; hes played by Jeffrey Wright who gives his character a nicely menacing ambiguity. The only source of genuine vitality is Alona Tal bright and appealing in the role of Billys adoring secretary and ad hoc bookkeeper. But Ms. Tals role lies between small and tiny and a whole chunk of it is devoted to a discussion of accounts receivable. --J.M. DVD Focus ENLARGE Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines Warner Bros./Everett Collection Terminator 3 Rise of the Machines (2003) Arnold Schwarzeneggers guardian robot is back with his vast chest and freeze-dried visage to protect mankinds young savior-to-be John Connor who is played in this go-round by Nick Stahl. This Terminator lets it be known that hes an obsolete design. Kristanna Lokens killer robot T-X is not obsolete; shes drop-dead beautiful and mesmerizing. And so in her way is Claire Danes as Johns reluctant accomplice a veterinarian named Kate Brewster. ""T3"" was directed not by James Cameron but by Jonathan Mostow. While it lacks the elegance of its predecessors its an efficient entertainment at the very least. ENLARGE The Devils Backbone The Devils Backbone (2001) Of the many striking images in Guillermo del Toros dark and absorbing horror film the most memorable is the starkest--an unexploded bomb that stands like the black slab in ""2001"" in the arid courtyard of a Spanish orphanage. The time is the late 1930s. Inside the orphanage which shelters children of Republican fighters and politicians the pale ghost of a young student named Santi wanders the grounds. Outside civil war rages; thats a horror story in itself. This is a horror flick that also functions as an allegory of the war that still haunts Spain eight decades later. ENLARGE Three Kings Three Kings (1999) With Mark Wahlberg making ""Broken City"" look better than it is and David O. Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" up for multiple Oscars the time has come to remind you once again of Mr. Russells action adventure set in the poisonous aftermath of the first Gulf War. A visionary film that leaves you elated and agog its pandemonium with a moral purpose. Mr. Wahlberg is Sgt. Troy Barlow one of three soldiers enlisted by George Clooneys Capt. Archie Gates to liberate tons of gold bullion stolen from Kuwait. The other two are played con brio by Ice Cube and Spike Jonze. --J.M. 5 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Jason Bourne Whats Happened So Far?

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A former New York City cop does some dirty work for the mayor and discovers more than he bargained for. Rated R (violence language) BOTTOM LINE This coulda-been classic noir features crackling work from Wahlberg and Crowe but the over-serious tone eventually takes the fun out of things. CAST Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe Catherine Zeta-Jones LENGTH 149 The setting of ""Broken City"" is clearly New York but the date seems a little fuzzy. Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) a disgraced cop who shot an unarmed black man exists in the present while Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) is a dirty dealer from the Boss Tweed years. Other characters include a loyal secretary a greedy businessman and several downtrodden minorities but theyve all been around forever. That mix of old-fashioned noir and modern-day political thriller is one of the charms of ""Broken City"" directed by Allen Hughes (without his brother Albert; their last film was ""The Book of Eli""). Its script by Brian Tucker harks back to a time when a powerful man like Hostetler would hire a schmo like Taggart to tail his beautiful wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones). No webcams or GPS for Taggart -- hes a shoe-leather guy with a camera and he carries his photos not on a hard-drive but in a manila envelope. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Comedy Central upset over use of fake Colbert? Mike Hammer would have relished the muck that Taggart uncovers although Sam Spade might have done so with more finesse. Taggart learns too late that his dirty work is somehow connected to Hostetlers high-polling mayoral contender Jack Valliant (a very good Barry Pepper). By then a man has been murdered and Taggart may be implicated. ""Broken City"" has some crackling moments mostly involving Wahlberg and Crowe. The Bostonian and the Australian are convincing as street-smart New Yorkers and Jeffrey Wright adds to the grit as a shrewd police commissioner playing both sides. The problem is that Hughes wants to wring his hands over the material instead of just having fun with it. ""Broken City"" wants to get heavy about politics and corruption but all its really saying is Twas ever thus.

But as an opportunity for hard-boiled types to trade threats blows and caustic banter this modern-day noir works reasonably well. The story begins in a New York housing project where scruffy undercover cop Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) has just dispatched a felon. The victim had it coming it seems but that doesnt mean the shooting is strictly legit. Billy faces both angry demonstrators and a possible jail sentence until Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) and Police Commissioner Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) ease the cop out the back door. Billy wont do time but he cant be a police officer anymore. Seven years later Billy is working as a private eye making a modest income by photographing married people in compromising poses with their lovers. Hes living with aspiring actress Natalie Barrow (Natalie Martinez) whose connection to the opening scene will eventually be revealed. So will the intense devotion of Billys secretary and overdue-bill collector Katy (Alona Tal). Hostetler is now in a close race for re-election against patrician City Councilman Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) a challenger whos making a stink over a major real-estate deal in which the city unloaded the very same housing project where Billy fired the shots that ended his police career. Aint conspiracy in the big city tidy? When the mayor hires Billy to follow his glamorous wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) the ex-cop assumes its just another cheating-heart gig. But then Billy is more earnest than clever as several of the other characters notice. ""What are you"" Cathleen asks him -- ""stupid or Catholic?"" Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) hopes to gain as much control over his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) as he has over the city of New York. Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox hide caption toggle caption Alan Markfield/Twentieth Century Fox The detective begins to wise up after something bad happens to Valliants campaign manager (Kyle Chandler) and like all the best noir protagonists he doesnt like being played for a fool. Billy would rather blow up his own life than let the mayors apparently corrupt secret deal succeed. As he has demonstrated before Wahlberg can deliver tough-guy cracks faster and more fluidly than the hip-hop rhymes that began his career. Crowe glowers smirks and blusters as well as any contemporary cinematic macho man. And the perpetually underemployed Zeta-Jones is coolly elegant while boasting a more stable American accent than Crowes. Director Allen Hughes doesnt stylize Broken City quite so flamboyantly as such previous efforts as From Hell and The Book of Eli (both co-directed with his brother Albert). But he does keep the camera circling restlessly notably in the talkier scenes. He also cloaks the action in the obligatory darkness and backs it with a droning groaning electronic score composed by a team led by Atticus Ross. (Hes the guy who collaborated with Trent Reznor on music for The Social Network and the Hollywood version of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo). If Broken City is more notable for attitude and ambiance than plotting it does pose some lingering mysteries. But these may have less to do with Brian Tuckers script than with last-minute edits While the conflict between Billy and the mayor resolves neatly -- too neatly in fact -- other characters and storylines just evaporate. It might take a smarter gumshoe than Billy Taggart to uncover everything that was originally supposed to happen in Broken City.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Another January dud. Broken City drops hot-shot actors in a quicksand of cliches and watches them sink. Like last weeks Gangster Squad Broken City thinks its Chinatown. Talk about delusional. Mark Wahlberg stars a Billy Taggart a New York cop forced to resign after a controversial shooting. But Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crow) has his back. He hires Billy now a private investigator to catch Mrs. Mayor (Catherine Zeta-Jones) screwing around. What seems like a simple adultery case opens a rats nest of political corruption. Allen Hughes going solo as director without his brother Albert (oh for the glory days of their Menace II Society) is totally sidetracked by a caffeinated script by newcomer Brian Tucker that runs the gamut from hyper to frenzied. Wahlberg stays solid as the movie goes kaflooey. But I kept wishing his recent costar Ted the trash-talking bear would show up and set this movie straight. I mean someone needs to call bullshit on Crowe struggling with a New Yawk accent for playing the Mayor in a bad rug and a worse spray tan. This is a broken movie.

"Broken City | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; broken-city ) Broken City (United States 2013) January 17 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Broken City? More appropriately Broken Movie. Theres an old multiplex proverb that goes something like this ""Beware ye movies opening in January that star A-list actors."" Broken City illustrates the wisdom of those words. This mess of a motion picture was accorded a mid-January release date because it was too high profile to jettison directly to home video. So the producers elected to go the landfill route dump it into the cinematic trash heap that represents the post-Oscar bait landscape and then move it quietly to DVD a few months later. Along the way a quote whore might even be impressed enough to give up a line or two for the jacket. Broken Citys problems are representative of overly ambitious stories that get stripped down and eviscerated in order to satisfy time constraints. Add an hour to the films running time and it might offer a richer more involving narrative. As it is its borderline-incoherent with subplots ending abruptly characters changing their allegiances with little motivation coincidence and contrivance fueling major plot developments and whole scenes seemingly missing. Its maddeningly frustrating because underneath all the sloppiness theres a potentially compelling tale of government corruption but at least in the final production we only catch glimpses of it like the moon occasionally peeking through on a mostly cloudy night. The movie opens with a prologue set seven years earlier than the bulk of the movie. In it we see police detective Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) in a courtroom defending himself against charges that he murdered a perpetrator. NYC Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) considers him a hero but the police chief Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) isnt so sure. Billy is exonerated but because damaging evidence has been covered up he must resign from the force to keep people from digging. He reluctantly agrees. Seven years later we catch up with him working as a P.I. His relationship with his live-in girlfriend Natalie (Natalie Martinez) has grown stale but hes not moving in on his feisty assistant Katy (Alona Tal) even though she obviously has a thing for him. One day Hostetler calls Billy to a meeting. He needs someone to track his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whom he suspects of infidelity. He wants pictures and the identity of Cathleens lover. Currently in the middle of a tight mayoral race with challenger Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) Hostetler cant afford for this story reaching the papers so he offers the princely sum of 50000 if Billy can get him what he wants. It goes without saying however that all is not as it seems and Billy is being manipulated like a pawn in a chess game. In the right role Mark Wahlberg can be a tremendous asset to any movie. Unfortunately Billy is not the right role. Wahlberg is stiff and unconvincing and it quickly becomes apparent that the film would have benefitted from someone with a more volcanic temperament in the lead. As his adversary Russell Crowe brings a little more to the part but this isnt the New Zealand-born actors finest hour. Catherine Zeta-Jones continuing her comeback from obscurity takes another step toward re-entering the consciousness of an industry with a ridiculously short memory. The two actors who make the biggest impressions are Jeffrey Wright playing a top cop with conflicting interests and allegiances and Alona Tal as Billys assistant. Taken at face value the central conceit of Broken City is so preposterous that it makes The Hobbit seem realistic by comparison. With plot holes wider than the Lincoln Tunnel the movie becomes impossible to take seriously. Theres also an issue with unfulfilled expectations. Throughout the film were led to believe there will be some big ""reveal"" - a twist or secret that will cause us to gasp in shock. When it comes its so muted and unsurprising that it diminishes the films climax. Hostetler who initially seems to be a canny powerful spider at the center of a complex web turns out to be a common crook with few tools at his disposal. His personal army seems to consist of Billy and another ex-cop. Even the mayor of Small Town USA has a few more stooges. Broken City tries to use Billys personal life as a means to beef up his underwritten character but the approach fails. The scene in which he falls off the wagon is so overplayed that it works better as comedy than drama. His romantic relationship with Natalie which boasts an intriguing backstory disintegrates with a suddenness that isnt credible and the films unwillingness to ""go there"" with a Billy/Katy hookup ignores the evident chemistry between Wahlberg and Tal. Its likely that what attracted director Allen Hughes (one half of The Hughes Brothers the sibling team that made their debut with Menace II Society) to the project is the concept that politicians will sell out some of their most vulnerable constituents for personal gain and the chance to make political points. The problem isnt only that this has become stale through overuse (how many movies have we seen over the years with corrupt politicians or government officials) but that in this case the telling is sloppy and mangled. Whether the core flaw lies in the script or is the result of overly aggressive editing the final result is offers only sporadic glimpses of the compelling thriller Broken City fails to evolve into.

Artificial slope to open at Buck Hill this fall next Movies 187324881 Broken City could use fixing REVIEW ""Broken City"" needs repair work to overcome all the red herrings en route to its big swindle. By COLIN COVERT Star Tribune January 18 2013 -- 1119am Video (0523)  A New York City political thriller starring Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Matt Gillmer Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint The political suspenser ""Broken City"" stars Mark Wahlberg as cop-turned-private eye Billy Taggart whose investigative talents are not exactly of Sherlock proportions. He takes a window-peeping assignment for incumbent Mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) who is suspicious of his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is vanishing for clandestine meetings with a confidant. Hostetler a glad-handing phony-folksy bigwig with a dangerous side says he suspects infidelity. Taggart cant ever quite get his telephoto lens in the right place to verify it. He snaps pictures of activities that seem incriminating but the images are blurry awkwardly framed and inconclusive -- much like the poorly focused film itself which peters out after a promising start. Where most movies have a dramatic arc this has a squiggle. Its easy to lose your way as you trip over the storys multiple red herrings. Taggart has an old revenge-killing rap hanging over his head with residual guilt that threatens his sobriety and his relationship with his actress girlfriend. Someone conspires to use illegally concealed evidence to extort his cooperation in a shifty scheme but does not reveal this leverage to Taggart until near the finale. If you dont let your blackmail victim know youve got the goods on him you have no hold on him so whats the point of being secretive about it? As he begins to obsess over his own lovers trustworthiness Taggart finds himself in a situation mirroring the mayors. The situation boils over with her film debut which includes an explicit lovemaking scene with her costar. Barry Wetcher 20th Century Fox Russell Crowe left and Mark Wahlberg star in the politics-and-crime thriller ""Broken City."" Taggart responds with his knuckles diminishing the moral distance between himself and the obviously untrustworthy mayor. Wahlbergs character needs a more active conscience to function as a dramatic foil for Crowe. If the script was building a thematic parallel between the antihero and villain it shouldnt have suspended construction so suddenly. As the egocentric Hostetler Crowe acquits himself well. He deploys a vast wardrobe of scowls and bogus smiles that slither across his face. Wahlberg repeats his typical macho primitivism. Hes an appealing actor in the hands of the right director -- remember how he glowed onscreen in ""The Fighter"" -- but Allen Hughes working for the first time apart from his brother/filmmaking partner Albert cant sharpen him up. Hughes emphatic style pounds home the storys easy ironies and shapes the scenes so poorly were not sure if theyve made their point before theyre gone. Zeta-Jones looks the part of a mature glamorous wife which is all thats required of her. As for the mechanics of the big swindle at the heart of the story any cub reporter with a day pass to the hall of records could have discovered it. ""Broken City"" is a fractured movie.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday January 17 2013 119 PM Title Broken City Film Info R Language violence sexuality. Area theaters. The New York you see in ""Broken City"" is one you will recognize but not because you live here. It looks familiar because its the same generic metropolis you can find in countless other blandly made and quickly forgotten thrillers like this one. Director Allen Hughes has given us some powerful films about urban decay (""Menace II Society"" ""American Pimp"") but he seems stymied by the intricacies of political corruption. There is no urgency and little honesty to the convoluted goings-on unfolding here. Fortunately lead Mark Wahlberg is constitutionally incapable of an inauthentic performance. Though weve seen versions of his character many times before -- from him for starters -- he brings a sympathetic weariness to the role. As Billy Taggart he was once a respected NYPD cop. But he made a fatal mistake and found himself without a badge. Hes barely scraping by as a private detective when Mayor Hostetler (Russell Crowe) calls. Hostetler is running for reelection against newcomer Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) and has a problem Hostetlers wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) may be getting cozy with Valliants chief of staff (Kyle Chandler). Its Taggarts job to confirm the affair. What he finds however is more complicated than he expects. Soon Taggart is being targeted by the mayor his wife and the police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) all of whom are on different sides. Plus Taggarts marriage is ending and hes fallen off the wagon at the worst possible moment. All these threads could have tied up into interesting knots but instead they just dangle loosely. Taggarts wife (Natalie Martinez) disappears never to return. Hes an alcoholic whos started drinking again but nothing comes of it. The mayors corrupt crony (Griffin Dunne) is forgotten. And the action grinds forward dutifully and dully. Crowe attempting some sort of New Yawk accent couldnt be less convincing if he broke out into a solo from ""Les Miserables."" Zeta-Jones is on elegant autopilot and Wright treats the project like a lesser ""Law amp; Order"" episode. Wahlberg at least keeps the story watchable. But even he cant fix whats irreversibly broken.

As New York City mayor Nick Hostetler Crowe is the best thing in Allen Hughess cluttered formulaic thriller which is to say hes enjoyably terrible. With his perma-tan Julius Caesar bangs and an outer-borough yawp that lands on your ears like the Sunday Post hitting your doorstep Hostetler is a New York monster to rank with J.J. Hunsecker in the classic ""Sweet Smell of Success."" Too bad the movies not remotely up to that level. Mark Wahlberg plays the lead role of Billy Taggart a city cop who shoots and kills an unarmed rapist and is busted off the force. Cut to seven years later and Billy is a private detective working the usual adulteries until the mayor calls him in for a favor. His wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) has been stepping out and with Hostetler going neck-and-neck with crusading city counselor Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) in the upcoming election the last thing the mayor wants is to look like a cuckold. Thats not how Brian Tuckers script puts it but you get the drift. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Theres more a lot more too much more. Tucker a first-timer obviously loves his Bogart movies and shady film noirs and he writes dialogue that occasionally smacks pungently against the wall (""I believe in loving the one youre with."" ""What are you stupid or Catholic?"") but more often splats on the floor (""If he sees election day itll be from the inside of a cage like a monkey""). ""Broken City"" is overstuffed with characters including an upright campaign manager (Kyle Chandler) a conniving police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) a sleazy businessman (Griffin Dunne) and Katie (Alona Tal) Billys adoring gal Friday -- she really is right out of the Sam Spade playbook. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Unfortunately Wahlberg is all wrong for his role. Billys supposed to be a hard case waging an inner fight between his brutish and heroic sides but little in the actor conveys raging conflict. Wahlbergs best at playing oddly gentle tough guys and ""Broken City"" is too mean -- sometimes mean-spirited -- to let him go there. Its well shot and Atticus Rosss score channels 80s-movie synth soundtracks in ways that I think are supposed to be ironic. You could do worse on a slow Saturday night when theres nothing else on cable. But as the implausibilities and conspiracies and double-crosses pile up ""Broken City"" paints itself into a corner. A plot can be confusing as long as the filmmakers themselves dont seem confused but thats not the case here. Only Crowes mayor keeps the movies pulse going as he swaggers with greasy confidence through the city he rules.

"Broken City 1.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Broken City 1.5 stars SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED INFO Broken CityDirector Allen Hughes. Cast Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe Catherine Zeta-Jones Jeffrey Wright. Rating R for profanity violence and sexual content. By Randy Cordova The Republic | azcentral.com Fri Jan 18 2013 1144 AM There is a scene in ""Broken City"" in which two characters are inside a theater watching another film called ""Kiss of Life."" Its a very meta moment Actors stuck in a bad movie are watching actors playing actors stuck in a bad movie. Will the nightmare ever end? ""Broken City"" is the kind of hard-boiled claptrap that seems to appeal to Mark Wahlberg. He plays a (surprise) tough-talking heavy-fisted New York detective named Billy Taggart. He also has a wisecracking young assistant (Alona Tal); take away the profanity and you could have the pilot for a new CBS crime drama circa 1978. Mayor Nick Hostetler hires Taggart to investigate his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whom he suspects of cheating. The mayor is played by a particularly hammy Russell Crowe in big broad strokes. The actor is literally quite colorful; the makeup crew went a little overboard with the orange powder making Crowe resemble an Oompa Loompa at times. There is a lot of cheating and double-dealing as the movie is full of crooked cops and dirty politicians. There are plot twists galore but they unfold in ham-fisted fashion as if the screenwriter (newbie Brian Tucker) didnt know how to layer the mystery. Instead the movie simply drops these secrets out of nowhere in clunky fashion. Tucker also has a terrible ear for dialogue. The characters talk like rejects from Detective Fiction 101. A police commissioner (Jeffrey Wright) warns Taggart that he plans to put Hostetler behind bars ""like a gorilla and youll be next to him sucking bananas."" And no the line is not meant to inspire a laugh. The film also sets up plot threads it fails to resolve. Taggarts drinking problem is one such item as is his relationship with an actress (Natalie Martinez). The whole thing feels sloppily unfocused and it cant even generate B-movie thrills.

"Broken City starring Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Broken City So Much Drama About Contracts Broken City So Much Drama About Contracts Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Jan. 17 2013 1119 AM Im Pretty Sure I Saw Broken City the Other Day But this thriller is so generic I cant be 100 percent sure. By Dana Stevens Russell Crowe Jeffrey Wright and Mark Wahlberg in Broken City Photo by Alan Markfield/20th Century Fox. ""What was that other run-of-the-mill thriller I saw a long time ago?"" I wondered as I put on my coat after the Broken City screening. ""With Mark Wahlberg as a private eye and Russell Crowe as a corrupt mayor? ... Oh wait that was this one."" Broken City the first solo directorial outing by Allen Hughes (half of the twin-brother team who made Menace II Society From Hell and The Book of Eli) is one of those movies that recedes in the course of its own viewing. The movies curious capacity for self-erasure makes it a tough one to write about; less than 24 hours later I recall it with all the clarity of something I half-watched on a plane with a hangover in 1996. This much I know Mark Wahlberg plays Billy Taggart an NYPD cop whos forced to retire after being acquitted in a headline-making excessive-force case. Seven years later now the proprietor of an insolvent detective agency Taggart is contacted by the mayor Nicholas Hostetler (Russell Crowe) who suspects his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) of having an affair. Taggart tails the errant Mrs. Hostetler to a beach house in Montauk where the assignation in progress goes beyond mere adultery. What the mayor learns from the photos Taggart brings him could change the course of the impending election for which the Giuliani-esque Hostetler is currently running neck-and-neck with a more liberal populist challenger Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper). Like all the nonsinging parts of ABCs Nashville Broken City vastly overestimates its audiences degree of investment in the minutiae of crooked real-estate deals and mayoral election malfeasance. (At a key moment in the climactic Wahlberg/Crowe faceoff the camera dramatically tilts its way down to ... a contract To reveal ... signatures at the bottom That we already knew would be there thanks to the scenes ample exposition) Not every convolution in the overplotted middle stretch requires or repays the viewers close attention Theres just way too much going on from sordid revelations about Valliants campaign manager (Kyle Chandler) and the mayors police-commissioner crony (Jeffrey Wright) to a stillborn subplot in which Taggarts Puerto Rican actress girlfriend (Natalie Martinez) stars in a truly terrible-looking indie film. (Its possible the director intended that briefly glimpsed movie-within-a-movie titled Kiss of Life as a satire of terrible indies in which case he has a bright future as a genre parodist.) Advertisement Though its set in the present day Broken Citys tough-talking gumshoe protagonist and uniformly bleak view of human nature betray its aspiration to the cool nihilism of postwar noir. Everyones a dirty double-crosser from the mayor on down and our hero Taggart a pugnacious alcoholic is only one redemption scene away from being as rotten as the rest of them. What little integrity we do attribute to this morally sketchy protagonist comes courtesy of Wahlberg who has an innate gift for projecting guilelessness and deep-down decency even as he kicks a dude to death. (Theres plenty of violence in Broken City but its old-school sock-em-in-the-jaw-style violence ""dry"" rather than ""wet."") Crowe brings a sleazy blustering charm to the part of the villainous mayor even if his accent racks up frequent flyer miles careening between New York Boston and Sydney. And Barry Pepper--an interesting hard-to-type character actor who looks like a cross between Paul Dano and Christopher Walken--gets one big operatic breakdown scene that doesnt seem to belong anywhere in this movies tightlipped macho universe and is therefore one of the best things in it. There are a couple such so-wrong-theyre-right moments in Broken City--another being Catherine Zeta-Jones characters deliciously camp kiss-off to her humiliated husband which elicited an appreciative burst of laughter from a generally enervated audience at the screening I think I remember seeing. But for most of its running time this underachieving political thriller just sort of plods along hitting its genre marks with little concern for originality or style. If Broken City ever comes on when youre hungover on a plane go ahead and watch if youre in the mood for a movie--it will make an hour and 49 minutes of the flight pass marginally faster than they might have otherwise. Then again so would a Bloody Mary and a nap. Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Now Allen Hughes has gone solo and the result is an even bigger letdown a flaccid poor mans Chinatown starring Russell Crowe as a New York City mayor campaigning for re-election and Mark Wahlberg as the disgraced ex-cop-turned-private-eye hired to spy on the mayors adulterous wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Nothing is quite as it seems--unless of course youve ever seen a movie about big-city political corruption before--and soon the naive Wahlberg finds himself the magic ingredient in an insidious brew of billion-dollar real estate deals and cold-blooded murder. Almost but not quite silly enough to work as camp--this ex-cops girlfriend tried to make it as an ""indie film"" star--Broken City slogs through such fatigued plot ""twists"" as having one character confess to another without realizing hes being recorded. The actors look generally unhappy to be here most of all Crowe who seems even more miserable than he did in Les Miserables.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Brian Tuckers script for Broken City made the prestigious ""Black List"" of best unproduced screenplays in 2008. At its best though the film strains heroically to achieve its Chinatown-level ambition and transcend its hackneyed elements an alcoholic disgraced cop with a tragic past; a powerful politician with a secret he will go to great lengths to protect; an adulterous trophy wife; a high-stakes land deal with enormous ramifications for an upcoming mayoral election. In spite of some punchy scenes crackling dialogue and fine performances Broken City is hopelessly overmatched. It has Academy Award dreams but a detective-show heart. The ubiquitous Mark Wahlberg plays a dedicated cop whose career ended the moment he exceeded the boundaries of the law and killed a rapist and murderer who had been set free on a technicality. Years later Wahlberg struggles to pay the bills as a low-rent private detective snooping around windows hoping to snap pictures of cheaters in compromising positions. His fortunes change when New York mayor Russell Crowe wants a PI to investigate his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and identify her mystery lover in the days leading up to a tense mayoral election between Crowe and liberal challenger Barry Pepper. But the job ends up being about a whole lot more than simple adultery and Wahlberg has to put together the pieces of a far-reaching conspiracy. It doesnt take a degree in screenwriting to guess that the complicated land-grab deal laboriously laid out in the films first act will figure prominently in the films third act or that Wahlbergs career-killing transgression as a cop will come back to haunt him. Broken City luxuriates in moral ambiguity and the grinning convivial nastiness of Crowes performance in the early going but it grows less compelling as Wahlberg and Crowe settle into stock hero and villain roles. The film tries to magnify the sins of the powerful into a noir-tinged exploration of the fractured soul of a city but a lot of gritty detail and specificity gets lost in the process. Many of the elements introduced in the films overstuffed first act pay off all too tidily in its hokey final act but one thing never pays off the films tremendous largely unrealized early promise.

Gangster Squad Review Slick and Bloody Good but Weve Seen It Before Texas Chainsaw 3D Review One Interesting Idea Dozens of Stupid Ones Private eye Mark Wahlberg gets snarled in NYC mayor Russell Crowes ambitions but the promising scripts ballot box is overstuffed Let us mourn anew the death of Sidney Lumet the master filmmaker behind such classic  New York movies as the gritty ""Dog Day Afternoon"" ""Serpico"" and ""Prince of the City."" His is a voice that is sorely missed in American movies never more so than when we get subjected to something like ""Broken City"" a movie with Lumet-ian aspirations which like the corrupt NYC mayor at its center can barely handle the weight of its own ambitions. First-time screenwriter Brian Tuckers script starts strong laying the groundwork for what feels like a wonderfully labyrinthine web where corruption and deceit meet personal weaknesses and political hubris but by the films rushed and sloppy third act the whole thing collapses into a very familiar and not particularly compelling heap. ""Broken City"" opens with New York cop Billy Taggart (Mark Wahlberg) gunning down a teenager in a housing project; protesters are convinced that the shooting was murder but mayor Nick Hostetler (Russell Crowe) and chief of police Carl Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) suppress evidence damning to Billy. Cleared of charges the officer is then promptly sacked from the NYPD. Seven years later Billy is peeping in windows as a private detective specializing in infidelity cases when Hizzoner calls him up. With the election coming up in a few weeks the mayor asks Billy to track down the man having an affair with the citys first lady Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones). After tailing her a few days Billy catches her having rendezvous first in a public park and then later at a Long Island beach house with Paul (Kyle Chandler) -- who just happens to be the campaign manager for Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) the mayors opponent. Soon theres murder and a possible frame-up and lurking in the background is the mayors shady deal regarding the sale of that same housing project where Billy shot the teen and as ""Broken City"" lays out the characters and their motivations and secrets the movie promises a whiz-bang climax that never happens. Instead director Allen Hughes (working for the first time without his brother Albert behind the camera) wastes our time with pointless subplots -- you could completely excise Billys wife Natalie (Natalie Martinez) and her mini-dramas without affecting the story in the slightest -and evidence that all but literally falls into our heros lap. Wahlberg tends to be more interesting in his ""one for me"" movies than in his big-studio ""one for them"" projects but even though ""Broken City"" falls into the latter category hes at least making an effort to put some life into this conflicted ex-cop whos being buffeted about by forces beyond his ken. Overall its a strong ensemble with Crowe in particular relishing the larger-than-life qualities of this ruthless political animal. Theres a weird subtext of homophobia making its way through the movie from an extraneous gay plot twist to discomfort over metrosexuals and ""fags"" to a character using ""Cross-dresser"" as a term of disparagement. All this in a movie where the wife of the mayor of New York City gives a rousing speech about marriage equality to the Human Rights Campaign mind you. None of it feels germane and it mostly plays as awkward and anachronistic. Had the script gone through a few more drafts ""Broken City"" might have been a real contender of a political conspiracy thriller. As is however it could barely be elected dogcatcher.

""Broken City"" is an evocative and over-ambitious title for a so-so political potboiler that wants to be a gritty expansive epic of moral and urban decay. A mayors re-election bid collides with an ex-cops quest for redemption in director Allen Hughes competent but juiceless New York melodrama an unpersuasive marriage of head-slamming action and middling civic intrigue that treats issues like gay rights and public housing as red herrings rather than actual talking points. Despite a prestige cast led by Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowe Foxs mid-January release probably wont grab the rather serious-minded mainstream contingent its courting. Not without its weighty aspirations Brian Tuckers first-produced screenplay nonetheless seems to have just missed its moment with its tale of a contentious election season pitting government cronyism against working-class concerns. Still a pre-November rollout wouldnt have necessarily breathed fresh life into a story that offers a rather too glib and dramatically tidy peek inside the corridors of power. Although it reps the first solo helming effort by one of the Hughes Brothers ""Broken City"" feels of a piece with the sibling helmers past studies of violent crime and other social ills. A portentous slow-panning opening shot establishes Billy Taggart (Wahlberg) as one of New Yorks not-so-finest having gunned down a gang member allegedly in self-defense. Billy doesnt go to trial but his indiscretion gets him thrown off the force a politically expedient decision made by Mayor Hostetler (Crowe) and NYPD Commissioner Fairbanks (Jeffrey Wright) in one of several closed-door meetings. Seven years later Billy is barely getting by as a private investigator until he receives a call from Hostetler offering 50000 in exchange for evidence that his wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is having an affair. Billys snooping leads him to conclude that Cathleens lover is none other than Paul Andrews (Kyle Chandler) campaign manager for Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) a city councilman hoping to unseat Hostetler in the upcoming mayoral race. Naturally this revelation is far too juicy and preposterous to be the whole story and Billy turns out to be the mayors unwitting pawn in a vast painful conspiracy centered around a multibillion-dollar deal to level a public housing project. As various secrets spill out and bodies begin to surface the detective joins the crusade to take down Hostetler and in the process settle an old score. Yet by the time the script gets around to bringing Billys dark history into play it feels like a gimmicky narrative trump card rather than an organically developed aspect of the character. Wahlbergs Billy is a recovering alcoholic and maybe a cold-blooded killer but really hes just a blank slab of muscle the movie needs to drive the momentum forward someone to engage in high-speed pursuits attack guys with baseball bats and generally keep audiences from nodding off during the talkier stretches. Still even when the script merely skims the surface of the political agenda items it raises its crisp dialogue often shows a measure of rhetorical force particularly in a fiery over-the-top debate between Peppers challenger and Crowes incumbent. Rattling off streams of cynical condescending language in a sturdy enough Queens accent Crowe lends the megalomaniacal mayor a certain plain-spoken epithet-strewn eloquence while Wright Chandler and Zeta-Jones are effective enough in roles that dont require them to do much more than embody a certain type. Of the ensembles lesser-known names Alona Tal achieves a modestly snappy rapport with Wahlberg as Billys girl Friday while Natalie Martinez as the detectives aspiring-actress wife socks over two potent scenes that have no direct connection to the plot and are all the more intriguing for it. Supplementing Gotham locations with New Orleans exteriors the picture achieves a reasonable visual facsimile of its intended setting ably captured in Ben Seresins widescreen lensing and Tom Duffields sometimes pretty sometimes gritty production design.

TWITTER Mark Wahlberg Russell Crowe and Catherine Zeta-Jones star in Allen Hughes first outing as a solo director. Broken City tells a sordid tale of big-city corruption that would have made for a fine film noir 60 years ago but feels rather contrived and unbelievable in the setting of contemporary New York. VIDEO Mark Wahlberg and Russell Crowes Broken City Trailer Hits Online In his first solo directorial outing without brother Albert Allen Hughes uses an attractive and more-than-capable cast to compel interest in a revenge story involving multiple duplicitous individuals. However its never really convincing that the characters would do some of the far-fetched things required of them by the script resulting in a sense of detachment that is never helpful for a thriller. Star Mark Wahlberg scored reasonably well in mid-January last year with the OK action drama Contraband and this one should roughly follow suit. Who was the last mayor of New York City to automatically offer a Scotch to every visitor to enter his office? Bloomberg? Giuliani? Dinkins? Koch? Youd probably have to go back long before any of them. And yet thats what Russell Crowes Mayor Nicolas Hostetler routinely does and hes mildly offended if you refuse. Hes the sort of white old-time neighborhood guy who hasnt ruled New York in decades the first of a number of anachronisms in first-time screenwriter Brian Tuckers yarn which would have seemed more at home in a period movie than in one very much set in the present. Playing one of his patented working-class stiffs who often makes mistakes and then spends most of his time trying to compensate for them Wahlberg is Billy Taggart a tough cop whose overreaction on a murder investigation gets him kicked off the force but nonetheless wins the admiration of the mayor. Just scraping by seven years later as a private investigator -- as one character asks ""Do private eyes still exist?"" -- Taggart is paged by the mayor for a very personal job Hes to follow and photograph Hostetlers wife Cathleen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and the man with whom hes convinced shes having an affair. Its a matter of some urgency as the next mayoral election is in a few days. Because it involves voyeurism silences and the danger of being noticed the section involving Taggarts pursuit of the surreptitious couple is probably the best in the film and it has a good payoff The guy Paul Chandler (Kyle Chandler) is the campaign manager of Hostetlers mayoral race opponent Jack Valliant (Barry Pepper) which is just the first of several surprises involving connections compromised individuals and double-crosses that superficially highlight Tuckers script which contains a preponderance of very on-the-nose plot-driven dialogue. PHOTOS 20 Best and Worst Music to Movie Crossovers Meanwhile the temperamental Taggart has a rude awakening when he grumpily attends the premiere of an indie film starring his girlfriend Natalie (Natalie Martinez) and is forced to endure watching her getting it on with her co-star onscreen something he quickly presumes extended to extracurricular activity. In short order come a murder perfunctory chases and far too many people doing things and turning up in places that seem highly unlikely just before a big election. That the system is corrupt is clear at the outset and clear at the end but little that happens in between adds complexity or deeper insight into this political condition. Hughes direction is haphazard; some scenes seem perfunctory -- even useless -- others never find their dramatic centers a few are all right. Production designer Tom Duffield and cinematographer Ben Seresin make it all look good and ably disguise the fact that most of this very New York film was shot in New Orleans. Wahlberg who also co-produced does his bulldog blue-collar thing with practiced determination. Crowe is amusingly loquacious and sure of himself as the citys unquestioned boss man and would have been entirely convincing had the film been set in the 1930s. Zeta-Jones looks like class itself and nicely underplays while Jeffrey Wright has the intriguingly ambiguous role of the city commissioner whos been around long enough to have the goods on everyone.
