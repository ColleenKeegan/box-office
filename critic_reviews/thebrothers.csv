Comments click to enlarge The Brothers Grimsby Video Rated R  83 minutes  2016 Sacha Baron Cohen cowrote and stars in this embarrassment which attempts to straddle multiple genres--gross-out comedy rousing action-adventure touching family drama--and fails at all of them. His character a dim-witted potbellied English football fanatic with a libidinous wife (Rebel Wilson) and a gaggle of kids learns that his long-lost brother (Mark Strong) from their decrepit hometown of Grimsby has grown up to become a top MI6 agent. From the second the brothers reunite their Bond-spoofing spy adventure rivals Freddy Got Fingered in its crassness and revolting behavior. Cohen brilliant in his craftier and more avant-garde shock-humor roles is too irritating to make this character likable much less lovable as the story demands. Director Louis Leterrier (Now You See Me) delivers adequate action sequences but most of the ribald jokes and sight gags fall flat. With Isla Fisher Penelope Cruz Gabourey Sidibe and Barkhad Abdi.

Entertainment ""The Brothers Grimsby"" Blows Up James Bonds Cool Sacha Baron Cohen sets aside the cringe-stunt comedy to satirize a British icon. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Mark Strong and Sacha Baron Cohen in The Brothers Grimsby. Columbia Pictures ID 8193729 Anthony Horowitz the latest author to be tasked with generating new James Bond novels caused a furor by saying he thought Idris Elba was too ""street"" to play the famous fictional spy. But he was quick to say hed prefer Adrian Lester another black British actor because ""its not a color issue"" he insisted.Maybe not but it is an issue of class which Horowitz spoke around using terms like ""rough"" and ""suave."" Bond might be imperfectly aristocratic -- when Vesper Lynd reads him in Casino Royale she guesses that he didnt come from money -- but hes learned to fake it with the suits and the sangfroid in a way Horowitz seemed to feel Elba despite being suave as hell could not. View this image > Columbia Pictures ID 8193800 Which is what makes the joke at the heart of Sacha Baron Cohens new comedy The Brothers Grimsby such an enjoyable one even when the film as a whole weaves between being just hilariously foul and incoherently sloppy. It takes fellow Bond deconstruction Kingsman The Secret Services class consciousness to more outrageous extremes. The movie features a sleek Bond-ish agent named Sebastian Butcher (Mark Strong) who to his horror is plunged back into contact with his gritty past and the brother Nobby (Baron Cohen) he hasnt seen in years.The films warped version of former fishing town Grimsby is a place of grayish houses and shipping cranesfull of people who are on the dole and equally addicted to soccer and alcohol. Its a vision of the working class out of an alarmist scolds fondest dreams where people there name their many children things like ""Django Unchained"" and ""Skeletor"" and have home kebab machines. Once theyre reunited Nobby -- with his misspelled patriotic tattoos; his Liam Gallagher haircut; his equally cartoonish girlfriend (Rebel Wilson); and his inability to maintain any kind of filter -- clings insistently to Sebastian like a recurring rash. View this image > Columbia Pictures ID 8193805 If Sebastian-- with his tasteful clothing velvet voice and workplace flirtation with the Moneypennyish Jodie Figgs (Isla Fisher) -- recalls the iconic Bond who gallantly devoted his life to awesome adventures and international seductions for queen and country then Nobby is a reminder that no one really conveniently springs fully formed from a national imagination.The Brothers Grimsby which was directed by The Transporters Louis Leterrier doesnt just obliterate Sebastians dignity again and again with gross-out set pieces involving elephant uteruses (elaborately idiotically hilarious) and the sucking of poison out of body parts (gay panicky until it fully commits). Its about how the only difference between the patrician secret agent and his forever drink-clutching football hooligan sibling are the advantages the former got when he was adopted by a London couple and that ""suave"" and ""rough"" are designations as arbitrary as chance.

If all the exploding heads and anal-sex jokes and creative impalements of Matthew Vaughns tongue-in-cheek spy thriller didnt do it for you rest assured This time we get to see British super-agent Mark Strong and his Midlands yob brother Sacha Baron Cohen evade the bad guys by hiding inside an elephants vagina. Our heroes then find themselves trapped in that cavity as another elephant wanders up and engages in some hanky-panky. That mind you is the setup to the joke; the full gag is far more elaborate and gross.Anyway this is now a movie that exists so...yay?Film Details The Brothers Grimsby RatingR GenreAction/Adventure Running Time82 min. More Info Trailer Baron Cohen made his fame toying with the boundaries of documentary and fiction as the British faux-hop TV personality Ali G and the fake Kazakh journalist Borat. In both cases the actors elaborately outre characters interacted with real people with often hilarious results. Theres less performance art this time around Grimsby doesnt have a nonfiction bone in its body. But it still pushes at boundaries and the first one as you might have noticed is that of good taste. Theres a subtler transgression here as well Despite the baroque grotesquerie of the comedy the film is also at times a reasonably committed action movie like James Bond got hijacked by the worlds most gutter-minded juvenile delinquent.The director here is Louis Leterrier best known for directing Edward Nortons The Incredible Hulk and the first two installments of the gonzo Jason Statham franchise The Transporter and he understands the silly fun to be had from a fast over-the-top well-shot action scene. One of the earliest sequences in Grimsby features an extended p.o.v. shot courtesy of a fancy camera placed inside a contact lens as MI6 agent Sebastian Butcher (Strong) zip-lines into a crowd blows people away jumps off bridges and chases down motorcycles in an effort to capture his target. The sheer goofiness of the wide-angle lens mixed with the absurd speed of the sequence makes for thrilling breakneck slapstick. Most outright comedies nowadays arent this well put-together.We soon learn that Sebastian was separated years ago from his brother Norman a/k/a Nobby (Baron Cohen) who still lives in their old run-down working-class neighborhood in Grimsby in central England. Living off welfare (hes got nine to eleven kids -- the number keeps changing) he spends most of his time watching soccer downing pints and having filthy sex with his deliriously kinky mate Dawn (Rebel Wilson). Nobby has been pining all these years to find his missing brother and when a neighbor spots undercover super-spy Sebastian at a fancy fundraiser the ""Butcher Boys of Grimsby"" are reunited. Alas Nobbys meddling at the event also causes his brother to shoot the wrong person resulting in Sebastian becoming a marked man and needing to lay low. Where better to head than the cluttered disgusting home of his dimwitted brother about whom no one at headquarters knows? But soon enough the duo are hopping continents in pursuit of an arms dealer with a deadly virus that could wipe out a large swath of the human race.Most of the gags involve Nobby having to take Sebastians place in some elaborate scheme and then screwing everything up -- usually involving a bodily orifice or an exchange of fluids. But Leterrier ever the workman gives even the dumbest bits a kind of action-movie confidence and the slickness sells the silliness. He films a guy sitting his naked bum on a pathogen-loaded rocket with the same derring-do that he gives an action sequence involving a guy hanging from the bottom of a truck. And when a spray of AIDS-infected blood flies into Donald Trumps mouth (oh I should mention This is a movie in which Donald Trump gets AIDS) it does so Michael Bay-style in zooming slow motion.This brand of shock-humor is not for everyone. The film doesnt quite have the social conscience of Borat which sought to highlight American provincialism and narrow-mindedness as its outrageous foreign journalist traveled the country asking all the wrong questions. This time there are some feints made toward the exploitation of the working class. (""Its us scum who die in the wars started by the bastards in charge"" Nobby yells. ""Its us scum who keep the Fast amp; Furious franchise alive"") But those are the least provocative moments. Mostly The Brothers Grimsby simply wants to make you laugh. And it will. Whether youre laughing because the jokes are actually funny or because you cant quite believe that you just saw what you did...well thats between you and your god.The Brothers Grimsby Directed by Louis Leterrier Sony Pictures Opens March 11 Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Bilge Ebiri Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Film Reviews Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

"Brothers Grimsby The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; brothers-grimsby-the ) Brothers Grimsby The (U.K./Australia 2016) March 14 2016 A movie review by James Berardinelli Sony Pictures wisely decided not to unveil The Brothers Grimsby to critics. Would that they had shown the same deference to the general public... There are bad films and then there are bad films. This is a textbook example of the latter - a production that fails in every way at every turn. Why the (arguably generous) half-star? There is one funny gag in the entire (mercifully short) 83-minute running time. It comes during the end credits. If youre still there and have maintained a semblance of sanity you may get a laugh out of this. I wouldnt recommend staying for the end credits just for the joke. In fact I wouldnt recommend staying for the beginning credits. This movie is so atrocious I kept waiting for Nick Cage to show up. The Brothers Grimsby is a straight comedy. By that I mean the story (the foundation of most movies) is a meaningless contrivance - a device so moronic and infantile that no viewer could possibly care about its development or resolution. Thats not unusual for a certain brand of comedy but it puts an inordinate amount of weight on the jokes. They have to be frequent consistent and funny. Many films have trouble with one or two of those characteristics. The Brothers Grimsby is perfect in its failure. It takes a special film to amuse audiences on a level where things like plot and character become irrelevant. ZAZ found the recipe with some of their efforts. So did Mel Brooks. And the Pythons. But not the people behind The Brothers Grimsby. The story to the extent that it matters is about the reunion between two long-separated brothers. Nobby (Sacha Baron Cohen) is an Idiot with a capital ""I"" who lives in a cramped flat with a repulsive oversexed wife (Rebel Wilson). Sebastian (Mark Strong) is a black ops secret agent seeking to keep billionaire philanthropist Rhonda George (Penelope Cruz) from being assassinated. When Nobbys ill-considered plan for a reunion results in Sebastian missing a critical sniper shot he is branded a traitor by his boss (Ian McShane). With only his lovely assistant (Isla Fisher) on his side Sebastian must drag Nobby along with him on the run. Hilarity ensues... provided youre watching another movie. Sacha Baron Cohen can best be described as an uneven-but-inventive comedian sometimes brilliant sometimes weird and sometimes crass. Borat was at times hilarious. Bruno although ultimately disappointing had its moments. The Brothers Grimsby undershoots even the sewage-scraping low bar of an Adam Sandler comedy. It goes without saying that most of the humor is crude and vulgar. Nothing wrong with that as long as its funny. The Brothers Grimsby wouldnt know funny if Richard Pryor John Candy and John Belushi all rose from the dead to help it out. The screenplay is full of scatological material and those oh-so-hilarious conversations where one party thinks its about sex and the other doesnt. Then theres the elephant scene. This may be the first time I have seen something make Freddy Got Fingered look classy. The filmmakers have made the critical mistake of believing the faulty equation of outrageous+offensive= hysterical. In this case the sum is more along the lines of ""get me the hell out of this movie theater before I throw up."" Director Louis Leterrier known best for helming The Transporter and its sequel before moving up the food chain to The Incredible Hulk probably wishes he had changed his name before embarking on a journey into this nuclear wasteland. Although he cant entirely be absolved of blame (theres nothing on his resume that would indicate hes capable of crafting something this awful) Cohen is most likely the responsible miscreant. In addition to giving a cringe-worthy ""performance"" he gets a co-writing credit. If I had departed at the start of the end credits rather than sitting stunned in my seat for about 30 seconds trying to recover from the experience The Brothers Grimsby would have gotten a nice round zero. Sadly the one nugget of comedic gold arrives just in time to ruin the films dubious perfection. [SPOILER ""Did you meet the rest of the team?""] Its dangerous to make statements in March along the lines of ""this is the worst movie of 2016"" but if theres something more horrible waiting in ambush then it may be time to retire from this line of work.

The Brothers Grimsby just plain stinks review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Brothers Grimsby just plain stinks reviewOnce as rudely uproarious as flatulence at a funeral Sacha Baron Cohens shtick now simply stinks as the painfully unfunny The Brothers Grimsby makes all too plain.Sacha Baron Cohen right and Mark Strong star in The Brothers Grimsby.  (Sony Pictures)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. March 11 2016The Brothers GrimsbyStarring Sacha Baron Cohen Mark Strong Rebel Wilson and Penelope Cruz. Directed by Louis Leterrier. Now playing at GTA theatres. 83 minutes. 18ANo elephants were harmed during the making of The Brothers Grimsby contrary to innuendo but expectations surely were.Hope that Sacha Baron Cohen would regain the guerrilla brilliance of his comedy breakout Borat a decade behind in the rear-view mirror is now officially abandoned. Sony realized this and cold-opened The Brothers Grimsby at theatres Friday vainly hoping to dodge critical brickbats.Article Continued BelowOnce as rudely uproarious as flatulence at a funeral Cohens shtick now simply stinks. Hes turned into a dumber and crueller version of Benny Hill stooping without conquering as jokes about obesity disabilities AIDS effluence and orifices spew like a broken sewer pipe.His obsession with anal cavities and what goes in and comes out of them suggest Cohen is auditioning to be the after-dinner amusement at a proctologists convention.All of this in service of soccer hooligan Nobby his lamest character yet. Long of sideburns and short of IQ points Nobby lives in the English backwater of Grimsby along with his 11 neglected children his endlessly available wife (Rebel Wilson) and a pub routine of firing skyrockets out of his anus.The only thing lacking in Nobbys moronic existence is his beloved younger brother Sebastian seen in repeated soppy flashbacks gone 28 years since they were separated as orphaned children.Little does Nobby know although he soon learns Sebastian (now played by Mark Strong) grew up to become the MI6s greatest spy and hit man. A ludicrous global terror plot masterminded by a cheque-cashing Penelope Cruz brings the brothers back together of course for hijinks of the odd-couple and anally fixated kind. Which wouldnt be so terrible if any of this were funny which it really isnt. What few laughs the film elicits are of the groaner variety reserved for dirty uncles at family functions.Action director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter The Incredible Hulk) rams yuks home like the aforementioned elephants who give better than they get from their human violators in the movies grossest scene. Clueless about comedy Leterrier is comfortable only when his camera stares at chases and shootouts like zombie players of video games.It would be nice to think The Brothers Grimsby is just a bad creative choice by a talented comic. Sadly its part of a decade-long decline. Cohens post-Borat film career as lead actor has slowly deflated with Bruno The Dictator and now this debacle like air seeping out of a Whoopee Cushion.Is it too late to hope for a Borat 2?The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Brothers Grimsby review Bad guys spies and vile humor - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Brothers Grimsby review Sacha Baron Cohens taboo gross-out displays derail the film The Brothers Grimsby Columbia Pictures / Handout Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong star as long-lost siblings in ""The Brothers Grimsby."" Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong star as long-lost siblings in ""The Brothers Grimsby."" (Columbia Pictures / Handout) By Katie Walsh | Tribune News Service First the good news. ""The Brothers Grimsby"" Sacha Baron Cohens latest exploration in pushing the boundaries of taste gets a couple of things right. First and foremost it clocks in at a tight 82 minutes -- it knows just how long its schtick will last. Secondly co-writer and star Baron Cohens Nobby Butcher a working-class British football hooligan from the town of Grimsby is an entertaining character to throw into a spy parody. With his Liam Gallagher haircut and ever-present road beer hes created a character that would be amusing to observe in just about any situation.The bad news is that situations cooked up by writers Baron Cohen Phil Johnston and Peter Baynham on the other hand are entirely execrable. Literally. Theres a bizarre obsessive fixation on bodily fluids (in the gallons) and orifices (for spelunking). The problem is that the writers overly rely on these taboo gross-out displays to provide laughs instead of you know actual jokes. There is no private part of the body -- male female animal inside out -- left unmolested by the writers of ""The Brothers Grimsby"" and its what ultimately derails the film. The story sees the reunion of Nobby with his long-lost brother Sebastian (Mark Strong) separated by an adoption as kids. Nobby stayed in Grimsby binge drinking down at the pub and siring 11 kids while Sebastian turned into an awesome super spy in the style of James Bond by way of Jason Bourne. By a truly facile turn of events (a buddy shouts ""they found your brother"") the two meet again during one of Sebastians missions where hes attempting to thwart the assassination of philanthropist Rhonda George (Penelope Cruz).Bumbling Nobby causes Sebastian to botch the job and the brothers go on the lam with bad guys and bad spies on their tails in shoot-em-up action sequences chaotically directed by Louis LeTerrier. Nobby mucks things up and/or saves the day for his brother. Hes actually quite funny as an unlikely action star shuffling about in his socks and shower sandals or trying to show respect for the anonymous would-be hit men shot dead. Its the minor character details that make it work Nobby remaining ever himself in extraordinary circumstances. What doesnt work are the extreme grotesque scenarios that the writers have thrust the characters into -- and it does require a lot of thrusting. A bit of class struggle is injected into the proceedings though as Nobby is motivating the working-class ""scum"" with a speech that they ""built the hospitals"" in the same breath he also jabs that they ""are keeping the Fast and Furious franchise alive."" The proletarian message is wrapped in a depiction of working-class people as dumb fat drunkards. Hardly empowerment.Rebel Wilson turns up as Nobbys randy girlfriend Dawn and Baron Cohens wife Isla Fisher co-stars as Sebastians MI-6 gal Friday. Fisher manages to remain unscathed which is more than can be said for the other female co-stars including Gabourey Sidibe as a South African hotel maid. It must be said that the humiliations rained upon Baron Cohen and Strong are far worse and involve not one but two (perhaps three) sexual assaults involving both incest and bestiality. A final tag teases a future for these characters but if its anything like this well pass. Trailer The Brothers Grimsby Watch the official trailer for ""The Brothers Grimsby.""

So remember One of them actually serves a purpose. It makes baby elephants. The other makes piles of dung like this. A cinematic colonoscopy ""The Brothers Grimsby"" is a relentlessly scatological exercise in idiocy a walk through the monkey house in which Baron Cohen puts things up his bum and throws crud at the screen. In between the jokes things blow up. Mostly his career. The film stars Baron Cohen and the grimly implacable Mark Strong as British brothers separated in childhood. Strong has grown up to be a James Bond superspy. Baron Cohen meanwhile is a drunken sponger who fathers kids he cant support and gets extra welfare checks by shaving one childs head and pretending the boy has leukemia. Thats not offensive enough for you? Youre right. Baron Cohens character after all is only pretending the kid has cancer. So how about some jokes about crippled children? Or accidentally giving people AIDS? Thats always good for a few laughs. But hey its not all gags about sick people. There are also jokes about sex with fat people. And if thats not enough for you - wait for it - there are also jokes about sex with fat black people. Add in the usual gay-panic gags cultural condescension and tiresome ugliness and is like ""Borat"" all over again no? Well no because as crude as ""Borat"" was - a rancid camera collection of ambush interviews and cheap sarcasm - at least it occasionally turned its anger on big deserving targets. In comedy the blows always count for more if you punch up. But ""Grimsby"" punches down - at the sick at the poor at anyone whos not quick enough to get out of its sloppy roundhouse rights. Boy chronically unemployed drunks sure are funny arent they? Then it hands all this sure-fire material over to the director of the first two ""Transporter"" films. Youd think hed be happy to be given an intentional comedy for a change. But instead he just amps up the video-game graphics and frenetic editing as the two brothers get involved in international terrorism - Penelope Cruz having just survived ""Zoolander 2"" is inexplicably back for more - and race to defuse a deadly bomb. Too late. MORE Sacha Baron Cohens demands for attention There might be something to be said for ""Grimsby"" if it at least knew its subject and owned its nastiness. One reason Steve Coogans bits on trashy ""chav"" characters like Paul Calf are so daring is that Coogans never forgotten hes only a few lucky breaks away from working-class drudgery himself. But Baron Cohen is a rich boy and a Cambridge grad; his mockery of the uneducated reeks of snobbish privilege. And then he tries like a coward to cover it all up giving the brothers a sad backstory (told in grindingly dull flashbacks) or inserting a quick supposedly rousing speech about how the rich always take advantage of ""the scum."" And its true. They do. Just look at ""The Brothers Grimsby."" Ratings note The film contains graphic nudity sexual situations strong language violence and substance abuse. The Brothers Grimsby (R) Columbia (83 min.) Directed by Louis Leterrier. With Sacha Baron Cohen Mark Strong. Now playing in New Jersey.

"Review In The Brothers Grimsby Sacha Baron Cohen pushes crude to new levels - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review In The Brothers Grimsby Sacha Baron Cohen pushes crude to new levels Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong Daniel Smith / Sony Pictures Entertainment Mark Strong left and Sacha Baron Cohen in Columbia Pictures The Brothers Grimsby."" Mark Strong left and Sacha Baron Cohen in Columbia Pictures The Brothers Grimsby."" (Daniel Smith / Sony Pictures Entertainment) Robert Abele Sacha Baron Cohens humor is to show you a doughnut eat it then tell you where its been. Then maybe reveal how it wasnt a doughnut. Whether you laugh reel in disgust or smile and say ""Touche"" hes got his bases covered.While exuberant tastelessness has certainly made a place for itself at the comedy table thanks in part to Cohens own oeuvre his new ""The Brothers Grimsby"" spends 80 energetic minutes trying to make his nude wrestling scene in ""Borat"" seem as quaint as slipping on a banana peel. See more of Entertainments top stories on Facebook gt;gt; Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link When Cohens on theres a pointed sociopolitical tinge to the crassness. But that rarely happens in ""Grimsby."" Its not unfunny in spots but it huffs and puffs (among other bodily functions) more often than it splits the sides. Cohens latest character is Nobby Butcher a dim beer-swilling North Londoner in a Caesar-ish mullet whos crammed his nine kids into his dingy council flat but saved one room for the hoped-for return of the brother he lost to foster care years ago. (Grimsby is the fishing town they hail from.)When Nobby learns Sebastian (Mark Strong) is now a black ops assassin for MI-6 and in trouble after a botched mission he becomes the only help Sebastians got. Its the sibling reunion neither expected turning into a global pursuit to stop a nefarious plot to ""cure"" overpopulation by eliminating the working class. Trailer The Brothers Grimsby Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong star in ""The Brothers Grimsby"" in theaters March 11 2016. Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong star in ""The Brothers Grimsby"" in theaters March 11 2016. See more videos But to call ""Grimsby"" a spy spoof or a buddy comedy or a white-trash satire would be to assume a tonal soundness that you wouldnt hire a genre hack like director Louis Leterrier (""Now You See Me"") to draw out. This is the kind of anything-goes-anyplace movie in which the old suck-out-the-venom joke -- re-created here with a toxin dart to Sebastians crotch and some vigorous porno play-acting -- is just the appetizer. Again theres the phrase ""not unfunny"" but youd better get used to the flavor profile. After all our heroes need to hide in an elephant later a scene of almost towering biological ickiness.Occasionally theres method to Cohens gross-out madness. The tossed-off jokes between bad-taste wallops tend to land better because theyre not trying so hard like a funny bit in which Nobby recruits his hooligans-in-training kids to take on an approaching kill team by saying ""Theyre Manchester United supporters."" In fact most of the gags involving Nobbys soccer fanaticism are amusing and the ticking-bomb finale at a cup final in Chile includes some priceless digs at the sports lawlessness. But for the most part one sits through ""Grimsby"" -- a far cry from the sustained brilliance of ""Borat"" -- with a minefield suspicion that only sporadically leads to laughs. Long objects are eyed warily for expected penetration gags. One sees a terminally ill kid in a wheelchair and thinks ""Oh no."" (Oh yes.) See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story You worry that Gabourey Sidibe as a South African hotel maid unwittingly caught in a seduction scenario was hired for reasons other than being a great actress. And thats because weve already met the gung-ho Rebel Wilson as Nobbys current girlfriend who gamely set things up earlier with jokes about her body type. (Elsewhere Ian McShane Ricky Tomlinson Isla Fisher and Penelope Cruz are criminally underused comedic or otherwise.)And whether you laugh or not at the well-reported Donald Trump ""appearance"" in the film -- made even funnier by the disclaimer added to the credits -- its nothing if not a sign that Cohen will go where a lot of comedians wont. But it makes another moment in ""The Brothers Grimsby"" a shock by default Climbing into a bathtub Cohen covers himself with his hand. The modesty is almost unintentionally hilarious.------------The Brothers GrimsbyMPAA rating R for strong crude sexual content graphic violence nudity language and some drug useRunning time 1 hour 23 minutesPlaying In general releasecalendarlatimes.com Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on March 11 2016 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""A minefield of tasteless jokes - Some of Sacha Baron Cohens gags are good in `Brothers Grimsby.

Has he ever recovered? 2009s semi-sequel Bruno should have been the great stealth-nuke satire of the Prop 8 era but Cohens candid-camera comedy was already feeling a bit like schtick. But an actual screenplay didnt do 2012s The Dictator any favors. Cohens talents for media-baiting grotesquerie are unparalleled - like Anchorman 2 The Dictator was less of a movie than a press tour. Cohen was a presence. He gave good paycheck in Sweeney Todd and Les Miserables. (He couldnt sing but he wasnt alone.) Still when he showed up onstage at the Oscars in Ali G garb you worried it was the kickstart of his Legacy Act period. You expect a malcontent to go establishment to hide behind makeup in Alice in Wonderland sequels. Heres what you didnt expect That The Brothers Grimsby an upstairs-downstairs spy comedy would be Cohens best work in a decade. Cohen is Nobby Butcher a football hooligan from working-class Grimsby. Nobbys got 11 kids as many tattoos and no apparent job; his fashionspiration might be the Plumbers Crack. Nobbys also got a hole in his heart. As a child he was separated from his brother. That brother grew into Sebastian Graves MI6 superspy played by Mark Strong. Strong is one of those British actors you might call ""Bond Adjacent."" Hes handsome withdrawn looks good killing people. He was the Q analogue in last years Kingsman The Secret Service and a mournful MI6 agent in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. If you liked Kingsman you might not like Grimsby; I sure hated Kingsman and I sure loved Grimsby. With a filmmaker like Matthew Vaughn youre desperately aware of an anxious elitism a sense that the primary concern is making sure everybodys suit fits. Grimsby by comparison pairs Cohen with an ideal collaborator. Allow me to come out once and for all as a fan of Louis Leterrier a trash-candy director of the first order. Like Cohen Leterriers a Euro gone Hollywood. He worked on a couple Transporter movies before making The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans twin cheesefests deployed right in the thick of blockbusters grimdark phase. Leterriers got that French thing where he doesnt mind when things look fake. Maybe he prefers that. His digital effects look like greenscreen; his fight scenes are too choreographed to feel casual; he encourages performers like Tim Roth and Ralph Fiennes to go big. His finest showcase yet was 2013s Now You See Me a genre-smashing scenery-gnashing gem. Now You See Me was sort of a superhero movie and sort of a heist movie except nobody had superpowers and the heists made no sense. Leterriers approach to filmed action mirrors Cohens approach to comedy Scattershot hyperkinetic aggressively over-the-top. Too-muchness is the problem and the point. When we meet Sebastian hes on a mission that requires him to kill various people and jump on various vehicles. Leterrier shoots the scene partially in first-person - all spies in this verse have retinal Go-Pros - and it might be the best thing hes ever done. Leterrier doesnt do ""steady"" but theres a goofball grace to his staging. (Understanding Leterrier means understanding that he loves martial arts but doesnt mind pretending Dave Franco knows karate.) At one point in that first scene we watch through Sebastians eyes as he kicks a baddie down the stairs and then shoots him in midair. The whole action takes about a millisecond; Michael Bays been chasing a moment like that his whole career. Theres a pointy-headed film nerd notion called Chaos Cinema the idea that action movies have declined as action movies have sacrificed careful staging for the aesthetics of a movie trailer. Leterriers Chaos combines perfectly with Cohens chaos. Barely over 80 minutes long Grimsby fits in a trip to decadent London and scrubby Grimsby to Africa and South America. It has one of the single most disgusting sequences in movie history. (Suffice it to say I have no more questions about elephant physiology.) Theres a scene where blackbooted government goons storm a football pub and a couple of foulmouthed children fight back. From a window someone throws a wheelchair on one goon; when another goon attacks that same window throws down a living barking dog. (The kitchen sink is implied.) Rebel Wilson Penelope Cruz and Gabourey Sidibe swan in and out playing their most hyperbolized selves. At the risk of spoiling the plot this is a movie that involves the quote ""Because of you the head of the World Health Organization is dead and Harry Potter has AIDS"" Not everything in Grimsby works. The parading bad guys should feel more colorful or at least somehow differentiated. (I have a real soft spot for Scott Adkins a direct-to-VOD action star who made three movies yesterday but Grimsby reduces him to a few punches and a frown.) Leterriers filmmaking isnt precise enough to count as parody or satire so a running flashback origin story is exactly as boring as most flashback origin stories. And the film quickly loses interest in the MI6 side of the equation; Isla Fisher and Ian McShane do lots of screen-staring as the films variations of Moneypenny and M. But credit Grimsby for landing on a sledgehammer point. The movie takes the brothers snob-vs-slob backgrounds seriously. An MI6 agent calls Nobby ""working class scum"" and that classist insult reverberates throughout the film. Grimsbys biggest idea is that James Bonds England is also Mike Leighs England. Leterriers best visual gag is just shooting Sebastian - tall dark shimmeringly bald - inside Nobbys cruddy house a saggy-walled hovel where foulmouthed adolescents watch Breaking Bad. Crucially its Sebastian who seems unusual. He might as well be an alien or one of the Eternals from Zardoz. This is also the kind of movie where a baby wearing a diaper and English-Flag facepaint walks through a bar carrying a half-full pint of beer and the kind of movie where more than one set of private parts are thrust right into Sacha Baron Cohens face - and yours.

Add a healthy dose of bodily fluids. Then try to drink it all down. Amy Nicholson 03/10/2016 TheAmyNicholson Before you buy a ticket to The Brothers Grimsby heres an ethical test How would you react if a gunman shot a wheelchair-bound orphan... already dying of AIDS... whose blood splattered into Daniel Radcliffes mouth and infected him too? If youd applaud with joy at the deranged spectacle youre a monster. If youd storm out youre a flawless soul. If youd react like I did -- a gasp a groan and then a guilty chuckle -- heres your diagnosis You probably shouldnt become pope but boy are you going enjoy hating yourself for giggling through Sacha Baron Cohens gleefully vile gross-out comedy. Like last years Kingsman The Secret Service The Brothers Grimsby is a spit-wad at U.K. classism embedded in a spy caper. Cohen plays Nobby Britains lowest of the low who combines the worst traits of his most infamous characters Borats ignorance Brunos horniness and Ali Gs fashion sense and horrible facial hair. To English snobs lads like Nobby are every American redneck stereotype doubled including his three dumb patriotic tattoos and 11 doomed children whom he and wife Dawn (Rebel Wilson) dont so much raise as barely keep from dying. Chides Nobby to his chain-smoking fourth grader ""At your age you should be vaping"" Nobbys hometown of Grimsby is so dismal that its sister city is Chernobyl. Hes a product of his environment. As proof examine his estranged brother Sebastian (Mark Strong) who was raised by posh adoptive parents in London. After 28 years in civilization hes as suave as James Bond and as icy as the Queen. Thanks to his MI6 training Sebastian can easily handle gun battles and poison. But when hes dragged back to his shabby working-class burg we finally see Sebastian panic. Get me the hell out of here his eyes scream. Sony Pictures EntertainmentThe Brothers Grimsby is defiantly stupid. Most of the jokes are bad. Some are offensively tone-deaf like a bit where Nobby tries to seduce a maid (Gabourey Sidibe) he has mistaken for a sultry secret agent. Is the joke on him for thinking shes sexy? Or on her for existing? The movie cant even settle on a tone. Strongs Sebastian is deadpan as hell while Cohen plays Nobby like a hopping moron. Together its like sticking Daniel Craigs Bond in Austin Powers. The clash doesnt highlight their strengths it collapses entire scenes. None of Grimsbys jokes are clever. But none of them want to be. This is a film whose grand arc is a defense of scum. (Literally it ends with people cheering ""Scum Scum"") Which enables director Louis Leterrier (Now You See Me) to make the movie equivalent of a middle finger tickling your armpit. He doesnt just skate near the edge of good taste -- he leaps off the cliff screaming ""Suck this"" Yet I caught myself admiring Grimsbys resolve. Yes many of its gags are fueled by gay panic -- but at least its not that coy PG-13 bigotry that assumes audiences think its funny just seeing Adam Sandler and Kevin James hold hands. Theres nothing hilarious about aligning with homophobes; Grimsby is so extreme we cant align with anyone. In an early scene Nobby must slurp venom out of his brothers testicles. Leterrier cuts to Nobbys aghast peeping friends -- a typical ewwww-gross beat -- and then goes further. He lingers over Sebastians testicle plopped on Nobbys tear-stained cheek splatters the screen with semen and caps it with a traumatized Nobby shivering in the corner. The much-longer-than-youd-expect scene is a cruelly pleasurable roller coaster. Its a nauseating scream-worthy risk. At the end my theater exhaled. Then it burst into cackles. Grimsbys balls -- actual balls -- broke our dignity. And there are jokes worse than that. The titles nod to famous fairy tale authors The Brothers Grimm sounds ironic but it isnt. The Brothers Grimm wrote X-rated shockers about incest bestiality and cannibalism. It took them seven editions and 45 years to finally publish a book for kids. If anything The Brothers Grimsby is cleaner -- at least theres no cannibalism. (Incest and bestiality check.) Three hundred years later were still fascinated by the same taboos. Weve just gotten harder to shock. Instead of Hansel and Gretel stuffed inside an oven we get Nobby and Sebastian stuffed inside an elephants vagina. Will the saga of Nobby and Sebastian someday tuck children into bed like its folk-tale predecessors? I hope not. But youre forgiven for enjoying it today. For penance as you leave the theater feed a strangers parking meter recycle a soda can and give a homeless man a dollar. Then youre allowed to buy a second ticket and go back in.

Photo Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Brothers Grimsby Running time 83 minutes. Rated R (profanity violence nudity sexual situations gross-out humor drug use) As a comedy ""The Brothers Grimsby"" is weak and scattershot but its useful as an unintended self-indictment of the chattering classes disgust and disdain for white working folk. A movie that is half as unkind toward people of color as this one is to whites would be publicly burned and its makers called to account but Sacha Baron Cohen raised in the upper-middle class and a Cambridge graduate relentlessly scorns his lower-middle-class character Nobby as stupid drunk and patriotic. All of these characteristics are noxious to the swells these days in Britain and elsewhere. Cohens movie is in large part an attack on Englands ""oiks"" or ""yobs"" -- commonly supposed to live in dumpy public housing with too many children doing uncouth things like putting English flags on their property and lining up for welfare checks (poverty ha ha). The French call this sort of aristocratic sneering de haut en bas. I call it kicking a man when hes down. A scene from ""The Brothers Grimsby.""Photo Daniel Smith Worse its pulling the rug out from under him then laughing when he gets hurt. ""Oikophobia"" is a workable term for this distasteful tendency of elites to scorn the salt of the Earth. Cohens climactic Donald Trump joke in the final moments of the movie tells more than he understands Struggling whites on both sides of the Atlantic feel that the policies of Cohens smarty-pants guild of groovy globalists are responsible for their plight in the first place. Nobby the kind of guy who likes to shove fireworks up his bum while getting drunk and watching soccer in the pub blunders his way into a meeting with his long-lost brother Sebastian (Mark Strong) now a secret agent. To follow the class japery there is lots of porny humor in the middle of the movie ""Suck out the poison"" Sebastian commands his brother after being shot with a dart in a sensitive place. OK I laughed at the way that scene plays out and theres one hilarious episode in the middle of the movie when the boys discover the woe that can result when hiding from bad guys inside an elephants vagina. But the rest of the potty humor (including an endless discussion of a pesky chunk of human waste) is largely as tiresome as the regrettable dumb-guy gags such as the numerical error on Nobbys tattoo. Nor does the method Cohen devises for Harry Potter to get AIDS tickle the ribs. Later on as Cohen (who co-wrote the script which is directed by Louis Leterrier with many a clattering and random action scene) senses hes in trouble with the people to whom he wants to sell tickets the movie makes some sympathetic noises to the white working class. Cohens big speech is a (would-be) stirring defense of ""the scum."" Nice try but next time youre trying to be nice to a group maybe dont call them ""scum."" Cohens villain has devised a hate-fueled plot to attack the working class but then again so has . . . Cohen.

Share Tweet Sacha Baron Cohen obviously holds certain strong beliefs about what constitutes good comedy--a willingness to risk offense or disgust for one and an intense commitment to creating distinct characters for another. Perhaps less heralded and more technical is his clear dedication to the art of brevity. In contrast to the Judd Apatow style of letting comic narratives breathe or the Adam McKay style of letting certain improv runs take films on (sometimes brilliant) digressions Cohens longest film as a comic lead--Ali G Indahouse which didnt receive a theatrical release in the United States--still clocks in under 90 minutes. This makes particular sense for projects like Borat and Bruno that hybridize sketch comedy and documentary and probably couldnt sustain themselves for longer. But as Cohen has moved on to more traditional fiction features like The Dictator and now The Brothers Grimsby his seeming dedication to both outlandish characters and extremely brief running times remains--and sometimes to the detriment of his material.Grimsby has the most straightforward high-concept story yet for a Cohen comedy. Two brothers are orphaned and separated as children; Sebastian (Mark Strong) is adopted by a posh family and becomes a grim super-spy while Nobby (Cohen) remains in their hometown of Grimsby and becomes a lowlife football hooligan and father to approximately a dozen children. (Nobby himself has trouble keeping track of them though they all live together in a rundown flat.) When their paths cross as adults Nobby is eager to rekindle their brotherly relationship just as Sebastian finds himself wrongfully implicated in an assassination and hunted by good guys and bad guys alike. Comical misadventures ensue.Simple enough yet the movies scant 83 minutes dictate that The Brothers Grimsby proceed impatiently; the movie feels cut to fit the running time rather than for the effectiveness of either the story or the comedy. The brothers childhood is chopped up and parceled out in brief flashbacks throughout the movie which makes sense for one key piece of plot information but also perversely denies the audience easy emotional inroads. On a more technical level several comic scenes end abruptly as if the punchline or the kicker has been cut off. Director Louis Leterrier was probably hired for the Sebastian side of the movie to lend faux-authenticity to the movies knowingly jumped-up version of spy craft. His contribution to the movies freneticism particularly during the extended POV action sequence that opens the film is clearly intentional but it doesnt add much when the movie shifts to comic set pieces rather than semi-ironic action bits.Given all of that its almost impressive that The Brothers Grimsby works as well as it does--which is to say intermittently and likably. Cohens social commentary is limited this time around to making some light points about the scapegoating and abandoning of lower-class ""scum"" as Grimsbys football hooligans are referred to at one point. But Cohen has a great feel for gags of squalor. The town of Grimsby like Borats Kazakhstan is a real place so heavily caricatured that it initially sounds like something Cohen made up; in the film a sign boasts of its sister city Chernobyl. Its a little mean but an early sequence where Nobby happily totes a mattress through the streets to the tune of Blurs ""Parklife"" feels downright affectionate. (The film evens the score on 1994 Britpop by scoring a later scene with ""Cigarettes amp; Alcohol"" by Oasis.)Theres also a hilarious moment pitting some of the towns smaller hooligans against an army of more polished soldiers--but like several of the movies best gags its oddly truncated. With such relentless cutting big laughs brush up against hacky jokes as well as jokes so hacky they almost seem bold. A sucking-out-the-poison bit for example is taken to such an extreme that it may well do the world a real courtesy by killing all future sucking-out-the-poison bits. (The same cannot be said for say the mistaking-a-fat-person-for-a-pregnant-person gag.) That willingness to go too far is sometimes funnier than the jokes themselves; its hard to understand why Cohen and his cowriters decided to stage the worlds most elaborate and explicit elephant-sex gag (some kind of insane desire to show up The Love Guru?) but it takes on a kind of deranged grandeur in its disgusting pointlessness.Eventually though The Brothers Grimsby runs out of room to fully work as a hit-or-miss comedy--and perhaps most disappointing doesnt reserve any of its hits for co-stars Isla Fisher Rebel Wilson Gabourey Sidibe and Penelope Cruz; its a great diverse female cast assembled to do not very much. It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that a scattershot Sacha Baron Cohen movie would work better if it rambled on longer and maybe its Cohens aversion to easy structure that enables his more gonzo leanings. It might be fun though to find out for sure.

(Daniel Smith) BY Gersh Kuntzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday March 10 2016 827 AM Title The Brothers Grimsby Film Info With Sacha Baron Cohen Mark Strong Isla Fisher Rebel Wilson Gabourey Sidibe and Penelope Cruz. Director Louis Leterrier. Rated R (strong sexual content language penises scrotums anuses). Area theaters. Theres no real point in reviewing ""The Brothers Grimsby."" If you like dumb gross-out comedies featuring men fellating each other double entendres about penises and feces and an obsession with the anus straight out of elementary school youll love Sacha Baron Cohens latest effort. If you dont what pray tell is wrong with you? Full disclosure I was the lone critic in America to unabashedly recommend ""Zoolander 2"" so Im certainly not ashamed to even less abashedly beg you to go see ""The Brothers Grimsby."" I say that not because its a great film -- hell its not even a good one -- but I laughed for pretty much the entire movie most of the time against my better judgment. The plot took Cohen all of four minutes to concoct Two orphaned brothers inseparable since their parents demise are indeed separated when one is adopted. The lucky one (Mark Strong) becomes a fierce unstoppable British secret agent. The other (Cohen) becomes an unemployed lager lout who loves nothing but football his hilariously oversexed wife (Rebel Wilson) his 11 kids and the brother he hasnt seen in 28 years. Predictably they finally reunite -- with the idiot brother setting off a chain of events that send the siblings fleeing around the globe until they can prove their innocence and save the world (with those aforementioned anuses). The ""plot"" of ""The Brothers Grimsby"" kicks in when the idiot brother (Cohen in rear) startles his superspy sibling (Mark Strong) and he kills the wrong person. (Daniel Smith) Its ""Zoolander 2"" -- but with only one idiot not two. And with much better action scenes. Seriously if MGM needs a new Bond it should look no further than Strong who is terrifyingly effective in the superspy role. So I make no apologies Sacha Baron Cohen is a dumb-smart genius embedding plenty of subversive humor amid all the fart and poop jokes (and yes theres even a post-film joke about Donald Trump getting AIDS thats worth waiting for). When one of his kids complains of being winded from a chore his character says ""You shouldnt be smoking. I told you at your age you should just be vaping"" When the loser brings his successful brother back to the slum where they were raised -- ""Grimsby Sister city of Chernobyl"" the street sign reads -- all around is squalor. ""Bet you dont recognize it since it was gentrified"" the idiot says. The brothers will go from this harrowing escape to hiding inside an elephant uterus. Yes its funny. (Daniel Smith) When he flips the TV to a nature channel to give his kids their daily ""biology"" lesson -- an innocuous video about elephant procreation -- you know somehow he and his brother are going to end up inside a pachyderm uterus later in the film. But you dont know that theyre going to be in there when a randy male decides to procreate. And you cant help but smile as the massive elephant member thrusts and thrusts and thrusts until the inevitable explosion. Biology indeed. On the negative side why is gross-out comedy so obsessed with the male rectum? At several climactic moments in ""Grimsby"" characters use their anuses to get out of trouble. Its about as funny as it was when James Franco and Seth Rogen did it in ""The Interview"" (no thats NOT a compliment). And why did Cohen waste the talents of Wilson who is given almost nothing to do? The trailer makes better use of her -- but those raunchy lines arent in the final cut. But thats just nitpicking -- and why pick nits when its more fun to suck poison out of your brothers scrotum?

VPCSacha Baron Cohen (left) and Mark Strong star in The Brothers Grimsby.(Photo Daniel Smith)If it was anybody else involved the sheer amount of genitalia involved in The Brothers Grimsby -- and from more than one species mind you -- would be shocking. But this is Sacha Baron Cohen so nothing really surprises anymore.Directed by Louis Leterrier the highly vulgar action comedy (1/2 out of four; rated R; in theaters Friday nationwide) isnt nearly as funny as it thinks it is spoofing spy tropes and buddy films and making a mockery of AIDS politicians movie stars and working-class Brits. At the very least its more entertaining than the time Baron Cohen dumped ashes on Ryan Seacrest at the Oscars but only barely.Known for his offensive hijinks with satirical characters such as faux hip-hip rude boy Ali G and clueless journalist Borat Baron Cohen wears mutton chops and a Cockney accent as Nobby Butcher a small-town soccer hooligan from the rough-and-tumble English town of Grimsby. He was separated from his baby brother after the death of their parents and Nobby has been looking for him for 28 years.His sibling turns out to be black-ops secret agent Sebastian Graves (Mark Strong) and their reunion could go better Nobby interrupts an important assignment Sebastian gets blamed for an assassination attempt and the bros go on the lam for a globetrotting misadventure to restore Sebastians good name and also stop a destructive weapon of mass infection.USA TODAYBaron Cohens Nobby Backs Donald TrumpKingsman The Secret Service and Spy did better jobs of sending up the genre but Grimsby with a screenplay co-written by Baron Cohen seems more interested in patching together a series of increasingly outrageous shenanigans than crafting a cohesive farce.The movies gross peak involves the twosome a female elephant and her many well-endowed suitors. Words dont do this fascinating and horrifying trainwreck of animal porn justice really.USA TODAYSacha Baron Cohen Isla Fisher donate 1 million for Syrian refugeesIn that sense you cant fault Baron Cohens commitment to the character. But whereas hes shown comedic genius at times in his career -- for example his frilly French racer in Talladega Nights -- theres nothing that nuanced about Nobby. There is a subtle theme involving his townsfolk and the disenfranchised standing up for themselves but even they end up becoming the butt of the joke.Strong is impressively game for playing straight man to his co-stars antics. However the supporting cast is wholly wasted including Rebel Wilson as Nobbys beloved Penelope Cruz as a philanthropic actress and Isla Fisher as one of Sebastians spy crew. Especially egregious having talented Oscar nominees like Gabourey Sidibe and Barkhad Abdi around just to play a maid and a drug runner respectively.A certain magical actor and a high-profile presidential candidate also factor into the movies primary running gag and the latters appearance near the end will probably cause some partisan cheering. That is if theyre out of the fetal position caused by that earlier call of the wild. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1pi71gO,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/03/10/brothers-grimsby-movie-review/81540656/,200,thebrothers17,thebrothers,usatoday
"The Brothers Grimsby is rude low-brow fun (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Brothers Grimsby is rude low-brow fun (R) The latest comedy by Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat) is a crude likable riot. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com3/10/2016 Editor rating 2.5 At one point in The Brothers Grimsby two men being chased by assassins hide inside an elephants vagina. Then a male elephant comes calling. This is a good example of what to expect in the latest comedy by Sacha Baron Cohen. For those with a taste for low-brow (but never stupid) humor Run dont walk. For everyone else Move along nothing to see here. Still The Brothers Grimsby is a step up from The Dictator the leaden comedy that marked Cohens transition into narrative features after the mockumentaries Borat and Bruno. All three of those movies were directed by Larry Charles a former staff writer and producer on Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm. The Brothers Grimsby was directed by Louis Leterrier whose previous credits include Clash of the Titans and Transporter 2. Make of this what you will. The Brothers Grimsby which spoofs espionage thrillers of the James Bond and Jason Bourne variety contains a fair amount of action which explains Leterriers participation. But the bulk of the film is a comedy about class differences punctuated at regular intervals by gross-out gags involving bodily orifices and fluids. One bit already notorious involves a computer-generated Donald Trump accidentally contracting  HIV.  This sounds tasteless and desperate until you see it within the context of the movie. Afterward it is still tasteless and desperate. But it is also kind of hilarious regardless of your political leanings. Nobby (Cohen) a working-class lunkhead and soccer fanatic discovers his long-lost brother (Mark Strong) is now an MI6 super-agent and they embark on a mission together. Thats pretty much all you get in terms of story -- narrative is not Cohens strong suit -- but The Brothers Grimsby doesnt need any more than that. The movie is a series of skits that have been stitched together into an 80-minute movie. Gabourey Sidibe plays a hotel maid whose full-sized figure reminds Nobby of his wife (Rebel Wilson). Penelope Cruz is an activist who may be harboring a secret agenda. Tamsin Egerton is a beautiful British spy who tries in vain to seduce Nobby. That seduction which plays out entirely with dialogue is one of the funniest scenes in the movie -- an example of how smart and playful Cohens comedy can be even at its most childish. For all its coarseness the movie is surprisingly affectionate toward its working-class protagonists. The scenes of Nobby at home with his 11 kids including Luke (short for Leukemia) are downright sweet. Nobby is one of Cohens more endearing creations a dim-witted bloke with a hardscrabble life who loves people as much as he loves heroin which he calls a gateway drug (as in ""a gateway drug to more heroin""). No its not all that sophisticated. But compared to glib junk like Zoolander 2 The Brothers Grimsby is practically high art. Unlike Ben Stiller at least Cohen is trying.

EntertainmentMovies The Brothers Grimsby Sacha Baron Cohen spy tale pushes boundaries Originally published March 10 2016 at 1201 am Updated March 10 2016 at 101 pm Sacha Baron Cohen left and Mark Strong in ""The Brothers Grimsby."" (Daniel Smith) Movie review of ""The Brothers Grimsby"" This spy comedy starring Sacha Baron Cohen and Mark Strong is more stupefying than funny. Rating 1.5 stars out of 4. Share story By LINDSEY BAHRThe Associated Press Be suspect of movies that are infamous before they even hit theaters. The ""They did WHAT"" anticipatory glee is generally bound to be a letdown -- especially when the big joke is someone getting a disease. In the off chance that youve managed to stay blissfully unaware of the gag I wont go into any more specifics. Needless to say it does indeed happen and it will leave you dumbfounded. Whether or not the joke will also elicit a laugh is the big question though. Its one that applies to much of the humor in the movie too which starts out with a Bill Cosby jab and steamrolls on from there. Movie Review 1/2   The Brothers Grimsby with Sacha Baron Cohen Mark Strong. Directed by Louis Leterrier from a screenplay by Baron Cohen Phil Johnston and Peter Baynham. 83 minutes. Rated R for strong crude sexual content graphic nudity violence language and some drug use. Several theaters. The plot finds a sweet-hearted dimwitted working-class Northern Londoner (Sacha Baron Cohens Nobby) reunited with his younger brother Sebastian (Mark Strong) after 28 years apart. Sebastian is now a top spy and assassin with a hard-core shaved head to match his ruthless attitude. Most Read StoriesThinking of voting for Jill Stein or Gary Johnson?

Strong plays it straight but isnt nearly as memorable as Jason Stathams turn in ""Spy."" Baron Cohen who also co-wrote the movie is sort of lovable as Nobby. In fact flashbacks to Nobby and Sebastians hooligan youth are fairly touching and effective. But then theres a joke about pedophiles at Legoland or an ancient ""Saturday Night Live Celebrity Jeopardy"" riff on the word ""therapist"" and your jaw is once again on the floor. Ultimately the jokes are more stupefying than funny and no ones anatomy is safe from a gratuitous close-up whether its that of a wild animal or an Oscar nominee. Its hard to give yourself over to a certain type of humor when youre still recovering from the shock of what you just saw or heard. And boy does ""The Brothers Grimsby"" push those boundaries over and over and over again. LINDSEY BAHR Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

Get over it. I say this because I was certain itd be yet another middling spoof of Bond films along the lines of Rowan Atkinsons ""Johnny English"" movies or worse the ill-conceived and poorly executed Melissa McCarthy espionage comedy ""Spy."" ""The Brothers Grimsby"" isnt any of those; as noted its funny. Directed by Louis Leterrier (""Now You See Me"") and written by co-star Sacha Baron Cohen with Peter Baynham (""Alan Partridge"") and Phil Johnston (""Zootopia"") the film spends all of about 40 seconds setting up the premise which proves to be 20 seconds more than necessary. See Video Sacha Baron Cohen Reunites With His Spy Brother in New Trailer for The Brothers Grimsby Sacha Baron Cohen plays Nobby the idiot amalgam of his three previous principal characters the clueless Ali G the boorish Borat and the outlandish Bruno. But Nobby isnt as bright as any of them. His chief and perhaps only virtue is his big heart. Twenty-eight years ago Nobbys little brother Sebastian disappeared. The adult Sebastian is played with all the alacrity of a head-shaved Bud Abbott by the naturally bald Mark Strong (""Kingsman The Secret Service""). In the years since his disappearance Sebastian has become a top MI6 agent while Nobby who never left Grimsby grew up to be an idiot and soccer-loving chubby-chasing father of nine. Rebel Wilson plays his zaftig horny girlfriend; it seems that Wilson is everyones zaftig horny girlfriend in every movie shes in. Here its not clear if shes the mother of the nine and beyond that she doesnt get much to do. The rest of the story has to do with a botched assassination attempt (courtesy of Nobby) and Sebastian going on the lam with his idiot brother both to stop an evil plot to kill millions and to clear his name. Also Read Sacha Baron Cohen Trashes Hooligan Donald Trump at Brothers Grimsby Premiere Baron Cohen and Strong are not at first glance an obvious comedic duo. Yet there they are -- funny just like the film itself. Which is odd since its such a bad movie. Often nonsensical and full of lousy filmmaking pretending to be avant-garde art cinema its certainly as tasteless tacky and cringe-evoking as anything Baron Cohen ever conceived. But the raunchy awfulness of ""The Brothers Grimsby"" is overwhelmed by a constant flow of chuckles guffaws and flat-out belly laughs it elicits throughout. Do note its not dumb. Stupid occasionally but never dumb not even when our heroes are inside the elephant vagina. Theres always a little bit of commentary going within or alongside the lunacy. Something about our gun culture or about sex and sexuality about our narrow standards of beauty and definitely about community and family. Its pretty savvy about a number of things but it never lets that get in the way of the laughs. The smarts of ""The Brothers Grimsby"" amidst its silliness is less surprising than it might be. Leterrier is mostly a stager of action who makes sure everyone hits their marks but Baynham who created the ""Alan Partridge"" series with Steve Coogan is an old school British television wit. And Baron Cohen for all his character antics and well-over-the-edge silliness is a Cambridge-educated history graduate. See Video Meet the Movie Press Batman v Superman Tracking Suicide Squad 2 Ghostbusters Hate As Baron Cohens career matures past the characters he created hes still willing to play the fool but in ""The Brothers Grimsby"" his Nobby is the butt of the jokes rather than some unsuspecting dupe who doesnt even know hes in a movie. That turns out to be more satisfying because a self-deprecating ass is always more charming than the regular kind. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

His previous films such as ""Borat"" and ""The Dictator"" were a dexterous blend of innocence and outrage but the new movie is a more blatant affair. Cohen plays Nobby a thick-whiskered lout who lives in Grimsby (a real British town) with his beloved (Rebel Wilson given far too little to do) and a brood of canny kids. One eats curry on the toilet; another is named Luke--short for Leukemia which he pretends to have in order to get benefits. Enter Nobbys long-lost brother Sebastian (Mark Strong) who is now a secret agent with M.I.6 and needs a place to hide. You expect a culture crunch (the sort of thing at which Cohen excels) but the director Louis Leterrier makes the odd decision to whisk the duo away and the film turns into a low-grade thriller filled with shoot-outs and explosions in foreign climes. We also get flashbacks to the brothers youth played quite straight as if heartstrings needed plucking at such a time. Still Cohen fans praying to be grossed out will be gratified to the hilt although the anal fixation apparent in all his films has passed beyond the Rabelaisian and arrived at the brink of the pathological.      --Anthony Lane Goings On A free New York City events app What to do tonight Follow goingson About Us FAQ Strongbox Customer Care Cartoon Bank On The Town RSS Contact Us The New Yorker Store Careers Reprints/Permissions Press The New Yorker Media Kit Conde Nast Digital Subscribe to a magazine View All Titles - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Bon Appetit Brides Conde Nast Traveler Details Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Lucky Self Teen Vogue The New Yorker Vanity Fair Vogue W Wired Other Conde Nast sites - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Allure Architectural Digest Ars Technica Bon Appetit Brides.com Conde Nast Traveler Concierge Details Epicurious Glamour Golf Digest Golf World GQ Hotel Chatter Jaunted Lucky NutritionData Reddit The Scene Self Style Teen Vogue Vanity Fair Vegas Chatter Vogue W Wired Use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement (effective January 1 2014) and Privacy Policy (effective January 1 2014).

Its a rich mix from one of the edgiest comic filmmakers around. And that makes ""Grimsby"" which comes close to being a warm-hearted comedy something of a surprise. Cohen started to ease off the satire in his writing with his previous starring vehicle -- which he also directed -- ""The Dictator."" In the new one satire has been thrown out of the window altogether -- and spoof has taken its place. It now seems as though Cohen has permanently abandoned the earlier shock tactic of imposing invented characters on an unwitting public which gave both ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" some of their most discomforting moments. And the pot shots on his chief target American society have all but disappeared. So has Cohen gone soft? Not quite considering that every other part of his comic armory remains intact - the willingness to shock and appall the fearlessness the ability to leave us in a loose-jawed heap. This simply feels like a holiday from controversy. Theres nothing grim about ""Grimsby."" Cohen is Nobby Butcher unemployed father of 11 and mad soccer fan good-hearted but a bit of an oaf. With his mutton chop sideburns limp hair and pot-belly he looks like Oasiss Liam Gallagher gone to seed. And theres also another Gallagher in the films DNA - the family from ""Shameless."" When Nobby celebrates an England goal its by putting a firework up his backside. He and girlfriend Lindsey (Rebel Wilson) dont think twice about having sex in the middle of a furniture shop. And when he reprimands his son for smoking the boy who cant be more than eight years old replies ""I thought you just meant crack."" These kids are terriers with no guidance of note from the adults but plenty of love. Nobbys long lost brother Sebastian (Mark Strong) couldnt be more different posh debonair and an MI6 agent. And hes quite the super-spy. If weve been wondering why director Louis Letterier of ""Transporter"" fame - and with no comedy in his CV - is handling this one (rather than long-term Cohen director Larry Charles) the extremely proficient and exciting action sequences provide one answer. As with other recent spy spoofs (""Kingsman The Secret Service"" for example) there seems to be an understanding here that visually the film needs to be up to scratch. Letterier keeps the story moving at a good clip and makes handsome use of his locations; not surprisingly when the characters and comedy come to the fore hes pretty anonymous. When Nobby gets news of his brothers whereabouts he tracks Sebastian down and within minutes wrecks his latest mission. Forced to go on the run together the mismatched siblings first hide out in Grimsby (where Nobbys idea of a ""secure location"" is a novel one) before heading to the more traditionally exotic locations of the international spy game. The comedy is as broad as it could be knee-deep in political incorrectness and bad taste. But as ever with Cohen its fueled by such imagination and daft abandon that what ought to be offensive becomes hilarious. Much of it is sex-related from Nobbys attempt to save his brother from the venom of a poison dart (ending with Strongs superb delivery of the retort ""It was a trickle of pre-ejaculate at the most"") to the brothers unfortunate encounter with elephants on heat which beggars belief and will leave many viewers in a crumpled mess. The movie is filled with seemingly improvised moments. One standout bit finds Cohen in turtleneck and underpants offering a deliberately bad Sean Connery impersonation to Gabourey Sidibes maid who he mistakenly thinks he must seduce on behalf of Queen and Country. More pre-planned humor includes a moment of deliciously naughty wish-fulfillment involving Donald Trump. Strong is terrific as the straight man to Cohens buffoon; despite the clamor for a black Bond ""Grimsby"" offers up a compelling alternative. Penelope Cruz seems to be enjoying herself as a diabolical mastermind but Ian McShane is underused as Sebastians MI6 boss. Some appropriately colorful British character actors populate a version of Grimsby here twinned with Chernobyl which wont do much for the real towns tourism prospects. Not that anyone is meant to take offense. Throughout Cohen and his co-writers frequently return to the brothers back story and the pain both have felt in their separation years before. Its a shrewd move which offers a sweet sincere underpinning to the comic mayhem. And it may help to make this Cohens most mass appeal movie to date. Whether he should remain in this lighter comic vein is another matter. As frequently hilarious as ""Grimsby"" is it doesnt see Cohen working at his full potential; we need him back in ""Borat"" mode baring his teeth.

TWITTER 3/11/2016 Sacha Baron Cohen stars as a welfare scrounger reunited with his super-spy brother in this broad comedy. Back in the late 90s when Da Ali G Show pulled in big ratings and before the Kazakh clown Borat spun off with his own film comedian Sacha Baron Cohen was arguably the funniest man in Britain if you didnt count Boris Johnson (the outgoing mayor of London). In the wake of the disappointment that was 2012s The Dictator The Brothers Grimsby (which will be called just Grimsby when it opens in the U.K. on Feb. 24) provides further evidence that Baron Cohen having embarked on a career as a straight actor is perhaps going a bit soft in his middle age. And thats not something one says lightly about a film featuring jokes about pedophilia AIDS and people being accidentally anally penetrated by all manner of strange objects. Indeed although bawdy penetration gags run right through the film theres considerably less of the incisive satirical skewering that distinguished Baron Cohens early work. Its possible that whats changed isnt the writer-producer-star himself so much but the industry and the social climate making it harder to finance films that are authentically risky and potentially hugely offensive. Its almost inconceivable now with the way things are when it comes to representation especially in the U.S. that a white Jewish man could get away with playing a racially ambiguous character like Ali G who achieved comedy immortality back in 1999 with the line ""Is it because I is black?"" Today Baron Cohen is more contained and circumspect confined to making jokes mostly about genitals and excrement. That kind of body humor was always in his repertoire in the old days (think of the epic naked tussle with Ken Davitian in Borat for instance). Whats significantly missing here is any spontaneous interactions with unsuspecting members of the public the comedy of cruelty and irony that was always his strongest suit. Meanwhile even a cursory survey of trailers on YouTube suggests that some of The Brothers Grimsbys sharper crueler lines have been cut and like every third movie off the production lines above a certain budget big chunks of it look like a shooter-style computer game necessitated by a script that casts Mark Strong (best known despite his triumphs on the stage for his character work in Kick-Ass and Kingsman The Secret Service) as super-spy Sebastian Grimsby reunited after a 28-year separation with long-lost brother Nobby (Baron Cohen). Perhaps producer-distributors Sony famously burnt so badly recently with the backfiring satire of The Interview plan to spin a game out of this for the Playstation platform. Even the citizens of Grimsby themselves who famously took umbrage at the thought of what fun Baron Cohen might poke at them when the film was just in production could hardly object much to this depiction. Sure the ""Oop North"" shown here is indeed a mildly grim place of poverty where football (soccer) is the official religion and nearly everyone is overweight drinks to excess and smokes even the kids. (""At your age you should only be vaping"" Nobby advises his 10-year-old son.) But by gum Nobby loves his kids all 10 or 11 of them. One is named ""Django Unchained"" another ""Gangham Style"" and a third ""Luke"" for the fake leukemia Noddy and his wife (Rebel Wilson) have made the authorities think the kid has so they can get extra welfare. Its even a sign of the times and how much Baron Cohen has apparently evolved that Wilsons generous size and that of Gabourey Sidibe (who appears later as a maid at a South African hotel whom Nobby must seduce for reasons too complicated to explain) is barely sniggered at. Fat jokes are so passe. But male-to-male fellatio-related humor judging by the evidence here is still all the rage as are jokes involving genitalia of elephantine proportions. Baron Cohen and Strong are both robustly physical performers and their finest moments are when theyre grappling with each other producing a great tangle of limbs and teeth. But the script credited to Baron Cohen Phil Johnston and Peter Baynham (based on a story by Baron Cohen and Johnston) is not especially generous to the other members of the cast. Wilson gets by in the very few scenes shes in on sheer native charisma while Isla Fisher (Baron Cohens wife in real life and one of the finest female comedians around today) is pretty much wasted in a strictly functional supporting part. Only Penelope Cruz seems to be having fun with a baddie role that basically makes her the Mugatu (of Zoolander fame) in this film but with less interesting hair.

Characters like Ali G Bruno and Borat all mocked social norms or satirised wonky attitudes and opinions. Grimsby is different. Its a silly raucous unashamedly juvenile fish-out-of-water comedy about two very different brothers Sebastian (Mark Strong) a slick spy and Nobby (Baron Cohen) a football-loving layabout who were separated as kids at an orphanage. Grimsby doesnt pretend to have much to say about anything - notwithstanding a final tongue-in-cheek plea on behalf of scum (Its scum who keep the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise alive) which plays more as a late gag than a theme. Instead it rides on base-level shock and awe patched together with knob jokes fat jokes semen jokes HIV jokes and arse jokes. If youre looking for a message youll be disappointed. The film reunites the brothers and quickly sends them on the run. Director Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans) drags the pair through the short sharp ordeal of a spirited action comedy all quick cuts and daring stunts and one that just happens to feature an endearing but relatively limp Sacha Baron Cohen character at its core. Fears that Grimsby might poke fun at the likes of Nobby disappear when you realise that hes just an excuse to catapult a clown - any clown would do - into scenarios as far-flung and unlikely as a South African game reserve a World Health Organisation conference in London and a football final in Chile. Youre never far from a punchline involving shit genitals cum or arseholes. The film is at its best when it wears its immaturity proudly. Theres a memorable scene involving a herd of elephants and a giant phallus which includes the terrified yell Its an elephant bukkake party Grimsby is a riotous mess - part I-dare-you-comedy part circus part action flick. Nobby is hardly a character for the ages. Hes a basic fool. The movie too is chaotic and crude. But its lack of sophistication like its odd mix of souped-up action and base comedy ultimately feels like a badge of honour.

An engorged animal member delivers the most inspired gag so to speak in ""The Brothers Grimsby"" a smutty but strained spy spoof in which most of the human-based comedy stays comparatively flaccid. Threadbare even by the raggedy standards of writer-star Sacha Baron Cohens post-""Borat"" output this tale of two estranged siblings -- raised on opposite ends of the British class spectrum -- reuniting to fight a global terrorism syndicate scores some stray yuks with its uneasy blend of jocular genre satire extreme gross-out content and casually bloody video-game-style action. Yet for all the boundaries it ostensibly pushes the pics mirth-to-minute ratio is notably lower than that of last years sweeter-natured ""Spy."" Some timely punchlines may earn these brothers a degree of fleeting pop-cultural notoriety; it remains to be seen however just how many HIV-AIDS jokes auds are willing to laugh at in an otherwise sparsely filled 82 minutes. On local turf ""The Brothers Grimsby"" is titled simply ""Grimsby"" -- referring to the apparently down-at-heel seaport town in northern England that the films cheerfully crude protagonist Nobby Butcher (Baron Cohen) calls home. Perhaps reasonably skeptical about the American marquee appeal of a location that falls pretty low on the U.K.s list of tourist hotspots Sony has rebranded its product with a Grimm Brothers pun that fits neither the films content nor the fundamental laws of naming The brothers last name isnt Grimsby after all. As a harbinger of the lame illogic to follow on the other hand the gussied-up moniker serves its purpose pretty nicely. After taking on Kazakhstan Austria and the Middle East in his big-screen gallery of national stereotypes Baron Cohen has reset his satirical targets closer to home. A binge-drinking dimwit with copious misspelled tattoos a Noel Gallagher roadkill wig and 11 variously foul-mouthed children Nobby follows Ali G Baron Cohens cult creation of the late 1990s in sending up the supposedly vulgar lifestyles and cultural eccentricities of Britains disenfranchised classes. Though ""Grimsby"" feigns a kind of solidarity with a society dismissed by other characters as ""working-class scum"" -- ""Were the scum that keep the Fast amp; Furious franchise alive"" Nobby yells at one point in a social rallying cry -- its hard to argue that Baron Cohens script co-written with Phil Johnston and Peter Baynham laughs with this population as much as it laughs at them with its blithe insinuations of commonplace pedophilia and crack addiction. In the cramped council house he shares with his raucous brood and sexually voracious wife Lindsey (Rebel Wilson utterly wasted) Nobby has doggedly kept one bedroom empty all along -- hoping for a reunion with younger brother Sebastian (Mark Strong) from whom he was separated 28 years ago following their parents death. (Misty-edged flashbacks reveal the boys unhappy backstory with an earnestness that chimes oddly with the pics present-day impropriety.) It turns out that Sebastian adopted by a well-to-do family has grown into an MI6 agent of Bond-level urbanity and ruthlessness -- an easy typecasting opportunity for Strong then albeit one entailing more scrotal exposure than such roles usually demand of him. Plot machinations that can at best be described as briskly unconcerned with consequential detail engineer a farcical fraternal reunion at a London charity summit held by actress and philanthropist Rhonda George -- played if thats the word by Penelope Cruz looking even less invested here than she did in ""Zoolander 2."" Nobbys buffoonery causes Sebastian to botch a planned hit on an identified assassin instead killing the director of the World Health Organization and wounding a Somalian child AIDS activist -- whose infected blood is the source of the films most sadistically motivated running gag. (Almost any subject is fair game for smart satire An upshot of getting-AIDS-is-gross perhaps does not meet the latter description.) With MI6 convinced that the luckless Sebastian is a dangerous turncoat thus deflecting their attention from the true security threat they should be pursuing he has no choice but to buddy up with Nobby on a globe-trotting chase that takes in a brief stop in Grimsby before moving on to South Africa and Chile where a mass terrorist attack is being planned at the soccer World Cup final. Besides offering Oscar nominees Barkhad Abdi and Gabourey Sidibe dismal roles as respectively a heroin dealer and randy chambermaid -- the pics professed empathy with the underclasses does not it seems extend beyond British borders -- the African interlude most notably accommodates the films most extravagantly conceived and jaw-droppingly executed below-the-belt set piece. Better seen than described its a startling scene so extraneous to the already loose surrounding narrative that it will easily be excerpted for a long life on YouTube. Baron Cohens unflinching ability to play dumb is still good for a few chuckles making some of the films funniest moments out of its most innocent quips ""I could have had your life"" Sebastian tells Nobby to which the latter gormlessly responds ""And you could have had mine."" But Nobby is a far idler comic creation than Borat or even Bruno Baron Cohens usual aptitude for elaborately transformative vocal and physical gymnastics feels half-hearted here in service of a character type weve already seen abundantly lampooned in British television comedy whether on ""Shameless"" ""Little Britain"" ""The Catherine Tate Show"" or elsewhere. The limited room for maneuvering granted the films female players including the oft-uproarious Isla Fisher in a straight-woman role as Sebastians MI6 ally is particularly dismaying; Cruzs scarcely curved arc meanwhile is stymied by some panicked-feeling editorial transitions in the final third. Action journeyman Louis Leterrier not an obvious choice to direct this kind of ribald material steers the proceedings with impersonal efficiency. The best that can be said for the films construction haphazard and frappe-blended as it often appears to be is that it ends sooner than viewers might expect.

Gregg Ostrin says March 20 2016 at 856 am An incisive and perfectly articulated review. It was like getting Tony Scott to direct a Rom Com - the movie didnt know what it wanted to be - a comedy with action or vice-versa. I think the joke quotient was probably more on par with ""Spy"" that it seems but Paul Feig knows how to put the comedy front and center and let the jokes breathe something this director knows nothing about. The movie was so hastily rushed along you have virtually no time to get to know any of the characters before you are on your way into the story. Also strange Baron-Cohen took three years to develop this script which feels like the rush job of all rush jobs. I think ""Borat"" was his ""Citizen Kane"" and everything since then has been increasingly less inspired. Hes a smart and funny guy - as his viral promotional pieces show (The appearances he did for ""The Dictator"" as the General were funnier than the actual film) - he has a great capacity for intelligently executed childish humor. Id love to see him put that to better use - maybe less genitalia and more genuine humor. Reply fredw says February 23 2016 at 925 am His first was great. He needs to go back to the reality docs. Reply Gerland says February 24 2016 at 1048 am I was surprised when that little boy shouted ""Fk Palestine fk Israel"" in a S. B. Cohen movie as he usually tries to shove Zionism down the audiences throat. Perhaps hes coming to his senses...
