By Peter Rainer Film critic May 14 2010 Save for later Saved Amanda Seyfried right and Gael Garcia Bernal are shown in a scene from Letters to Juliet. Summit Entertainment/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of There is a brick wall in Verona Italy the setting for Shakespeares ""Romeo and Juliet"" where women for generations have been leaving notes seeking romantic advice from ""Juliet."" The letters are dutifully answered by teams of volunteers. Upon this frail filament of a story line is strung ""Letters to Juliet"" a movie that has more sap than a pine forest. Amanda Seyfried who seems to be everywhere in the movies these days plays Sophie an American vacationing in Italy with her restaurant owner fiance Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal). A fact checker for the The New Yorker who dreams of becoming a writer Sophie gets her chance when she accidentally pries loose from the Verona wailing wall an undelivered 50-year-old letter which she answers herself from an Englishwoman named Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) about a lost love. Sophies response is so heartfelt that it has the surprise effect of luring Claire along with her wary belligerent grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) back to Verona in search of lost lover Lorenzo. Filling up entire notebooks with observations for an article Sophie teams with them to track him down.No secret where any of this is going. While Victor is gallivanting all over Tuscany in search of the perfect truffle or the best wine Sophie has plenty of time to contemplate Claires ardor - and Charlies handsomeness. Were supposed to see Sophie and Charlie as junior-league counterparts to Claire and Lorenzo. Will they blow their chance at a lifetime of bliss like the oldsters did or will they have the courage to embrace true love? If you guess wrong on this you should have your head as well as your heart examined. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Seyfried is fetchingly winsome though the director Gary Winick overindulges her big blue-green eyes. Redgrave alchemist that she is transforms corn syrup into vintage wine. Shes one of those actresses who can make even the dreariest role look good. (Lorenzo by the way is played by Franco Nero her real-life husband. They cast many smoldering glances at each other. Any acting required for these scenes?) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Letters to Juliet movie review The best reason to see ""Letters to Juliet"" is for the scenery. Why put up with airport traffic full body searches Icelandic ash clouds and lost luggage when instead you can sit back and bask in the warm earth tones and blue vistas of Verona Siena Lake Garda and Argiano. This movie doesnt need a ticket for admittance. Just a passport will do.

AMANDA SEYFRIED and CHRISTOPHER EGAN star in LETTERS TO JULIET. Photo John P. Johnson Summit Entertainment LLC Review Letters to Juliet 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Letters to Juliet Romance. Starring Amanda Seyfried Vanessa Redgrave and Chris Egan. Directed by Gary Winick. (PG. 101 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Not to be a cynic or anything but maybe a fictional 13-year-old isnt the best source of advice for the lovelorn. Yet there they are in director Gary Winicks ""Letters to Juliet"" a mob of sobbing women hunched over spiral-bound notebooks as they scrawl out tales of love and heartbreak in Juliets supposed courtyard at the supposed house of the Capulets in Verona Italy. Letters implore Shakespeares doomed teen lover for advice. And she writes back. A team of sassy ladies employed by the city dole out responses to every letter including a 50-year-old missive from a Brit named Claire that got wedged behind a loose rock and - golly - no one noticed in the ensuing decades. At least not until Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) arrives in Verona for a little vacay with her cute weird fiance chef (Gael Garcia Bernal). To amuse herself Sophie joins the ladies letter-writing brigade and whips off a belated reply to Claire prompting the near-instant arrival of the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) and her handsome snotty grandson Charlie (Chris Egan). The three then embark on a search for Claires lost love a Tuscan farmer named Lorenzo. So go the opening minutes of ""Letters to Juliet"" a squishy-soft romance set to bouncing Italian pop. Its like a long swallow from a bottle of a very sweet wine. Goes down easy warms the gut leaves a film of sugar on the teeth. Egan from Australia is an amusing fellow and Seyfried is fine but neither is the reason to see the movie. Redgrave is. After watching her elegant clear-eyed and nurturing performance in ""Letters to Juliet"" youll want her to brush your hair the way Claire brushes Sophies in the films most touching scene. Redgrave commands the corniest dialogue to stand up and sound like poetry. ""Life is the messy bits"" she says a line that echoes inevitably with her recent losses off-screen. -- Advisory Brief rude behavior some language and incidental smoking.

Stephen Cole The Globe and Mail Published Friday May 14 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Letters to Juliet Directed by Gary Winick Written by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan Starring Amanda Seyfried Vanessa Redgrave Christopher Egan and Gael Garcia Bernal and Franco Nero Classification PG Heres what probably happened Amanda Seyfrieds mother saw way too much of her in Atom Egoyans recent Chloe where she played an always-on call girl. Instead of sentencing her to her room Mom sent the young actress off to Tuscany with a gallon of Coppertone to make Letters to Juliet the sunniest G-est most old-fashioned love story imaginable. And just to make sure Amanda didnt get into any more trouble Mom insisted that her daughters escorts be neutered Ken dolls. Nervous juveniles who gulp before kissing. Then apologize. Seyfrieds latest screen incarnation is Sophie a New Yorker magazine fact checker who has never bothered to vet her fiance Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) an excitable chef who wears red pants and rhapsodizes about limp skinny noodles. Strikes one two and three. In fact she flies off with Victor to Italy to Romeo and Juliets Verona where she presides over a miracle of love. Every day in Verona heartsick women gather before a crumbling wall placing letters - prayers really - to Shakespeares most famous heroine. Perhaps sensing a kinship with the lovelorn Sophie approaches the wall and discovers behind a loose brick a faded 50-year-old note from a British schoolgirl. Sophie answers the lost letter advising her by now 65-year-old correspondent that love has no expiry date. Romeo may still be waiting for her in Italy bleeding poetry. Before long her pen pal the magnificent Vanessa Redgrave materializes swathed in flowing summer silks her silver hair shining. Sophie is thrilled sensing in Redgraves Claire the promise of life. Claire sees her younger self in Sophie. Remembers her dancing days. And so while dopey skittish Victor roams Italy in search of bargain foodstuffs for his new restaurant Sophie and Claire take off in search of love. The best scene here one so good it belongs in another movie finds Claire and Sophie alone in Sophies chamber. The older woman takes a brush to Sophies wet tangled locks observing that few things in life feel as good as having another person comb out your hair. Sophie who hopes to be a writer understands a metaphor when she hears one. Unfortunately Claire has a grandson tagging along a heap of cold porridge named Charlie (Christopher Egan) who is forever correcting Sophies grammar and pushing Claire into the shade. As you might guess after a great deal of sniping Sophie and Charlie supposedly fall for each other. But the audience never buys it. Charlie were pretty sure will never be able to comb out Sophies hair properly. Letters to Juliet is easy enough to watch. The Tuscan countryside is flooded with lemon sunshine. Seyfried and Redgrave appear radiant. If nothing else the film is inspired travelogue with a welcome oddball sense of humour. And we have our heroines driving up the steep winding hills of Tuscany aimed at the sun searching for Romeo listening on the radio to an Italian rendition of the old Monkees hit Im a Believer.

Cinematographer Marco Pontecorvos sun-drenched palette would be a perfectly sound reason to see this film but happily its not the only one.Based on a 2006 nonfiction book the story takes off from a real-life tradition in Verona where Shakespeares tragedy of teenage love was set. For more than 70 years volunteer ""secretaries of Juliet"" have answered the lovelorn letters written to Juliet and taped onto or tucked into the wall beneath her balcony.In the movie Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) a happily engaged fact-checker for The New Yorker travels to Verona on a pre-honeymoon with her chef-restaurateur fiance (Gael Garcia Bernal) who claims to have ""reinvented the noodle."" When Sophie sees a young woman gathering the Juliet letters she learns about the volunteers mission. Then she finds a letter hidden behind a loose rock written some 50 years before and describing a lost love of such intensity that she feels compelled to answer.Before she knows it (Italy must have amazing mail delivery to England) Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) the now elderly letter writer has shown up with her skeptical grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan). Bored with sightseeing and abandoned by Victor whod rather tour musty forests in search of truffles and taste cheeses for his new restaurant Sophie tries to help Claire find her lost teen love Lorenzo Bartolini. Movie Information Letters to JulietRatingShowtimes | Official siteDirector Gary WinickStarring Amanda Seyfried Christopher Egan Vanessa Redgrave and Gael Garcia BernalRun time 104 minutesMPAA rating PG (brief rude behavior some language and incidental smoking)Synopsis Amanda Seyfried travels to Verona and finds a love story of her own.More movies from GuideLive.comSpoiler alert here If you want to see this film flee when the trailer or commercial comes on because itll give away way too much including the conclusion of the search for Lorenzo which should be one of the most heart-rending moments in the film.The script by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan doesnt exactly zing or sing but its adequate. The lead trio of Seyfried Egan and Redgrave turn in such captivating performances that youd pay just to watch them watch that scenery. Its billed as a comedy but is much more romance with nary a belly laugh.Seyfried absolutely glows. She shows the same acting chops shes marvelously displayed on HBOs Big Love. Egan who played the lead in 2009s ill-fated NBC series Kings and starred in the film Eragon looks like a cross between young Matt Damon and Heath Ledger. Hes got the talent to propel him to those kind of Hollywood heights if he keeps choosing projects well. He does a touchingly believable job transitioning Charlie from a barely tolerable sourpuss into a young man of actual depth and perception.And Vanessa Redgrave? She can do no wrong and its pure fun to watch her banter with the young-uns. Film lovers will catch a clever homage to real love in the casting of her grown-up Lorenzo.Letters to Juliet may be a tad too predictable for some - less so if you avoid those trailers - but its a shimmering tribute to the glories of both true love and the Italian countryside.

Starring Amanda Seyfried Christopher Egan Gael Garcia Bernal Vanessa Redgrave Franco Nero Lidia Biondi Daniel Baldock Milena Vukotic Luisa Ranieri Marina Massironi Director Gary Winick Release Opened May 14 2010  Editorial Review Return to sender -- pleaseBy Michael OSullivanFriday May 14 2010Youve got to give the girl credit. In an age of communication dominated by e-mail texting and tweets the 24-year-old actress Amanda Seyfried -- star of ""Dear John"" and now ""Letters to Juliet"" -- seems to be on a one-woman quest to revive the lost art of letter writing. But if putting pen to paper is as much of a chore as watching her new movie the stationery industry is doomed.In ""Letters"" Seyfried plays Sophie a fact checker for the New Yorker who dreams of becoming a writer. While vacationing in Verona Italy she wanders into the House of Juliet a place where according to custom the lovelorn leave letters seeking romantic advice from Shakespeares tragic heroine. Not that shes any kind of authority on the subject and anyway shes fictional. But never mind. A colorful group of older female volunteers answers every one.Although Sophie hasnt figured it out yet she herself is among the heartbroken. Her fiance Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) with whom shes traveling just isnt that into her. A self-absorbed chef he seems to be more in love with whatever bit of pasta pastry olive oil or wine he has just popped into his mouth. With a look Sophie wishes hed reserve for her Victor goes through the movie pronouncing everything edible ""amazing"" or ""incredible."" (Really the guy could use a couple of new adjectives. I lost track after a dozen instances of each.)Left on her own Sophie naturally gravitates to the Miss Lonelyhearts at the House of Juliet who take her under their nurturing wings.But not as a client. After Sophie finds an old letter written by a British teenager named Claire whod fallen in love with and then left an Italian boy named Lorenzo Bartolini -- a letter written in 1957 but never answered -- Sophie takes it upon herself to compose a reply. The gist of it is this When it comes to love its never too late. Thats not advice; thats a fortune cookie.The next thing we know Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) now a senior citizen has shown up with her handsome but surly grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) in search of the lost Lorenzo. Against Charlies better instincts -- he thinks the whole thing is a dumb idea -- Sophie tags along as navigator and chronicler of the search. Although Charlie and Sophie bicker insufferably at first they will soon be canoodling. The screenwriters having decided in their infinite matchmaking wisdom that it makes sense to substitute one good-looking jerk for another. It doesnt.Some mild humor results from the fact that Lorenzo Bartolini is a popular Italian name. Theres even a famous 19th-century sculptor with that name.Without spoiling things it can be said that Franco Nero plays the grown-up Lorenzo in question and that the Italian actor is married to Redgrave in real life. The couple who wed in 2006 reunited in storybook fashion after a separation of 36 years following an affair that began on the set of ""Camelot"" and produced a son.Perhaps you see where all this is going.If not its all there in the trailer. Thats my advice to you which doesnt even require a 44-cent stamp Save yourself 10 bucks and an hour and 45 minutes of your precious time.Contains crude language and smoking.

A girl with relationship woes can hardly set foot in Europe these days without finding herself hip-deep in yummy food and tasty men. The latest iteration of the story is ""Letters to Juliet"" or as I like to think of it ""Eat Pray Hurl."" Shakespeare likely never even saw (much less required as inspiration) the tourist-trap ""Juliet balcony"" in Verona where sighing women today deposit letters to Romeos girl little suspecting that behind the scenes a team of self-appointed Italian yentas is hand-writing answers to every one. (Wouldnt that be unnerving -- like leaving a note at the Wailing Wall and getting a postcard from God?) Wandering into this scene with her fiance is Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) a New Yorker fact-checker who during a tense vacation with her betrothed (Gael Garcia Bernal) joins the letter-writing coven. She answers a 50-year-old note hidden in a nook by a now 65-year-old English grandma named Claire (Vanessa Redgrave soft of voice and gentle of countenance). VIDEO LETTERS TO JULIET REVIEW PHOTOS AMANDA SEYFRIEDS STYLE Claire tells Juliet in the decades-old letter that she regrets leaving her Italian boyfriend and returning to England. Sophie writes back that she should come back and look him up. While Sophie is still on vacation the letter zips all the way to England gets read by the grandmother (now widowed) and inspires her to instantly pack up and go to Italy with her grandson (Christopher Egan) in search of her old flame only to run into Sophie. The movie is an insult to David Remnick (sorry Dave -- The New Yorkers editor is played by the thunderously jowled man-walrus Oliver Platt) to common sense (Sophie Claire and the handsome grandson Charlie drive picturesquely all over Italy looking for the womans old boyfriend instead of picking up the telefono) and to the hacks over at Team Harlequin. They must be wondering why their words barely earn enough to keep them in chamomile tea and comfy cardigans while lavishly rewarded Hollywood screenwriters are allowed to serve up lines like ""I am really deeply truly passionately in love with you"" ""Sophie your writing is really good -- no its really really really good"" and (this one is about what its like to lose both parents in an accident at age 10) ""It was a difficult time."" Once Bernal starts spouting Felix Ungar lines and wanders off to bid in a wine auction while Charlie the grandson insults Sophie the rest of the film comes into plain view. The story is as straight and obvious as raw spaghetti. I was convinced I was being duped that things could not possibly be this simple that the movie couldnt have been made without at least one big twist. Perhaps Redgrave would get arrested by lads from the International Criminal Court posing a few pointed questions about her little romantic-comedy infatuation with the PLO in the 1970s? But all that occurs is . . . obviousness. For that you may thank director Gary Winick the nongenius (""13 Going on 30"" ""Bride Wars"") who slathers the Italian scenes with an oozing sun-dappled butteryness. Not to be left unspoken are such lines as ""Destiny wanted us to meet again"" ""An angel brought you to me"" and ""When we are speaking of love is [sic] never too late"" all delivered in an Italian accent. Seyfried whose huge-eyed vacuousness suggests two gray-blue zeppelins floating peacefully in a blank summer sky and Egan (imagine Ryan Phillippe subtract the note of ruthlessness and replace it with a twitty stolid aspect suggesting a JC Penney pants model) may be the perfect actors to carry out this assignment Neither is embarrassable. Seyfried manages not to wince when her character boasts of a Brown degree -- in Latin -- just seconds after mangling the meaning of ""caveat emptor."" And Egan . . . well lets just say that when he dutifully clambers up a balcony I wanted to congratulate him in the same way I wanted to shake hands with the moron who ran around on a baseball field until he got Tasered. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Okla. boy 12 an Internet hit with Lady Gaga song Read Next Okla. boy 12 an Internet hit with Lady Gaga song Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 30397 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 28702 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 17374 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

(Handout) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday May 13 2010 309 PM Title Letters to Juliet Though youd never know it from recent examples a decent romantic comedy should be easy to find. After all what do we really need? Likable leads a beautiful setting and a script that follows a reliable formula without feeling overly formulaic. Case in point Gary Winicks ""Letters to Juliet"" a 12 trip to Tuscany thats cheerfully undemanding but doesnt insult our intelligence.The action actually begins in Verona where Shakespeares young heroine once stood looking down at her Romeo. While on vacation with her fiance Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) lingers beneath Juliets balcony where women tuck love letters into the ancient wall. Sensing a story that might elevate her from fact-checker to writer at The New Yorker Sophie volunteers to help collect these notes only to find one from decades earlier.The author was Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) who fell in love with Lorenzo (Redgraves real-life husband Franco Nero) as a teenager. When Sophie sends her the faded letter Claire returns to Italy looking for her lost love. With Victor eternally preoccupied by business Sophie joins Claire and her skeptical grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) on the search for renewed romance.Winick who has had his highs (""13 Going on 30"") and lows (""Bride Wars"") makes the most of his well-matched leading ladies. Redgrave brings a lovely gravity to the lightweight proceedings while Seyfried again proves an unusually levelheaded presence.Aside from the goofy ending there are no silly pratfalls or fumbling misunderstandings - just several adults connecting to each other and the beguiling setting. Its a refreshingly sensible approach that should appeal to fans of both actresses. (If you ever wanted to plan a double date with your grandmother nows the time.)The weakest link is Egan his blandly stuffy Brit a regrettable contrast to the distracted but appealing Victor. Its hard to complain about two hours in Italy especially with Redgrave as our tour guide. But Garcia Bernals irrepressible charm provides a burst of welcome energy with each brief appearance. And when he steps aside so our star-crossed lovers can meet their destiny parting is sweet sorrow indeed.

Sophie a New Yorker researcher played by a live-wire Amanda Seyfried answers one herself. It was left in 1957 by Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) who enlists Sophie to help her find Lorenzo Bartolini the boy she left behind in her teens. Its unapologetic schmaltz deftly directed by Gary Winick (Tadpole) as if it really meant something. Redgrave is incandescent and casting Franco Nero as Lorenzo was inspired. Nero and Redgrave had a son soon after they co-starred in 1967s Camelot but they didnt marry until 2006. Watching art imitate life provides a charm that cant be faked.

Sophie has come to Verona with fiance Victor but then she meets Charlie. ABOUT THE MOVIELetters to Juliet  1/2 out of four Stars Amanda Seyfried  Vanessa Redgrave Gael Garcia Bernal Christopher Egan Franco NeroDirector Gary WinickDistributor Summit EntertainmentRating PG for brief rude behavior some language and incidental smokingRunning time 1 hour 45 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Letters to Juliet may look like a postcard come to life but it poses a burning question What would Juliet do? Shakespeares star-crossed Capulet of course is fictional. But in Verona real-life minions dole out advice to the lovelorn on her behalf. That idea serves as the mildly intriguing cornerstone of the massively photogenic Letters to Juliet. Its a chick flick with a likable premise. The storys predictable conventionality is mitigated by a few good performances. That doesnt mean its a great movie. But its an improvement over director Gary Winicks last attempt at combining comedy with romance -- the spectacularly awful Bride Wars. Its also better than Nicholas Sparks slavishly formulaic Dear John which also features Letters star Amanda Seyfried. YOUVE GOT MAIL JULIET And Verona secretaries answer it TRAILER Signature moments for Letters to Juliet Spoiler alert No one has a terminal disease here. Were spared the tear-jerking that plagues so many romantic-themed films. The fantasy stays upbeat and completely unrealistic. The comedy comes mostly courtesy of Gael Garcia Bernals offbeat character. Seyfried plays Sophie a magazine fact-checker on a trip to Verona with her ebullient restaurateur fiance Victor played by Bernal. Though they get along fine hes primarily interested in taking meetings and exploring the area for its culinary potential. But starry-eyed Sophie wants to share idyllic moments in the Tuscan countryside. Anyone who has seen a movie can guess that dreamy Sophie will rustle up some passion with a handsome traveler when ignored by her intended. Entranced by the castle of Shakespeares Juliet Sophie is fascinated by the work of Italian volunteers known as Juliets ""secretaries"" who respond to letters left by castle visitors. Sophie meets Charlie (Christopher Egan) and takes an instant dislike to the priggish Brit. Hes no fan of hers either. Given rom-com conventions their enmity is destined to tilt toward adoration. But add a Shakespearean slant and the course of their true love will not be smooth. Charlie is the devoted grandson of Claire (a luminous Vanessa Redgrave). The two have arrived in Verona at the behest of Sophie/Juliet who responded to a lost letter Claire wrote decades before. Handily Claire is widowed and able to go searching for her long-lost Italian love with Sophie tagging along. Who can resist a happy ending and a love that spans the ages? Especially when the lovers are played by real-life longtime couple Redgrave and Franco Nero? There are worse ways to spend a couple of hours. Set in some stunning locales in Italy Letters is a guilty pleasure thats lighter on the guilt and heavier on the pleasure.

"Letters to Juliet | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; letters-to-juliet ) Letters to Juliet (United States 2010) May 11 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli When it comes to romantic movies I have adopted a philosophy. All thats really required to craft an affecting love story is that the protagonists are well-developed the actors playing them evidence a degree of sexual chemistry and their relationship is allowed to unfold on screen. Details of the plot are relatively unimportant since all but the best romances follow an expected trajectory. Sadly of late romantic movies have become increasingly less convincing with star power trumping attraction and characters stalling before theyre half-developed. Letters to Juliet I am happy to report successfully applies the romantic formula and as a result provides a relaxing 105 minutes. If it drags a little toward the middle Im willing to cut it some slack. Whats important is that it avoids the unfunny jokiness and juvenile tendencies that define too many romantic comedies while also sidestepping the mawkishness of the Nicolas Sparks-inspired dramas. By falling somewhere in between - more serious than the average comedy and lighter than the typical drama - Letters to Juliet feels just about right. This love story isnt going to appeal to those who dont appreciate the genre; detractors will not become adherents. It is sweet and sentimental and embraces the fantasy (although it would have worked better without the treacly pop songs on the soundtrack). Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) is a top fact-checker for The New Yorker magazine and as such her job is not unlike that of a detective. Her hearts desire is to write a piece for the magazine but her boss (Oliver Platt) doesnt want to lose one of his best fact-checkers. While on a ""pre-Honeymoon"" vacation to Verona Italy with her husband-to-be Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal) Sophie uncovers the perfect subject for her first submission. At a house representing that of the heroine from Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet Sophie learns that every day hundreds of supplicants leave behind missives addressed to Juliet and there is a small group of self-appointed women who collect the letters and respond to them. After being invited to share in their task Sophie chooses something unique for her first project a 50-year old note written in 1960 by a confused 15-year old named Claire who is torn between staying in Verona with the man she believes to be the love of her life or returning to London. Sophie responds and to her surprise only several days later she finds herself face-to-face with a grateful Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) and her unpleasant acerbic grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan). Sophie joins the duo on a search for Claires Lorenzo employing her experience as a fact-checker to narrow down the possibilities. Along the way with Victor off doing his own thing Sophie finds herself increasingly drawn to Charlie especially when he begins to lower his guard. One common romantic staple is to place together two characters who cant stand each other then have them cross over the thin line between love and hate. The time-honored story is effectively executed here. There are two reasons to see the movie to experience the development of the relationship between Sophie and Charlie and to marvel at the images of Verona and its environs as captured by the camera of cinematographer Marco Pontecorvo. The secondary story that of Claire searching for her long-lost love is more obligatory than heartfelt although it provides Vanessa Redgrave with something to do. Its a way to keep things moving but at times it feels labored. There are about 20 ""Lorenzos"" to meet and it quickly becomes apparent that the first 18-or-so are going to be wrong turns. Letters to Juliet might have been special if the audience was to care as deeply about Claire and Lorenzo as it does about Sophie and Charlie. The cast provides enough star power to justify a wide release without overwhelming the delicate story. Amanda Seyfried has become a hot commodity in last few years having worked alongside the likes of Meryl Streep Pierce Brosnan Colin Firth Liam Neeson Julianne Moore and now Vanessa Redgrave. This is the kind of film in which she is most successful. Her face is extraordinarily expressive and she can tear up believably (something surprisingly difficult for some actors). She is well matched by virtual unknown Christopher Egan. Redgrave provides an expected dose of dignity although she recognizes that the role requires her to incorporate an element of giddiness into her 65-year old persona. Gael Garcia Bernals Victor is underdeveloped and used primarily for comic relief but thats often the fate of the ""other man"" in a romance. Letters to Juliet is being released as counterprogramming to the early blockbuster films of the 2010 summer with its primary competition being Iron Man 2 and Robin Hood. Indeed this movie has no designs on potential viewers of those two films; it wants to provide an alternative for anyone more interested in a story about people and love than action and testosterone. For those to whom this appeals it is a worthy effort.

Claire is witty smart and sensitive. Her eyes are cerulean her bone structure is extraordinary and shes effortlessly stylish. Shes also unusually mature. Im not sure how old Claire is supposed to be but Vanessa Redgrave -- who plays her -- happens to be 73. She is the most compelling reason to see Letters to Juliet which reminded me just the tiniest bit of Sir Laurence Oliviers A Little Romance -- if only because both feature the talents of a legendary British actor and Italian settings that have you ready to book your seats on Alitalia this minute. The movie is too saddled by Hollywood conventions to be as charming as that 1979 classic -- few things could be -- but director Gary Winick (13 Going on 30 and shudder Bride Wars) provides a pleasant night out at the movies. (See the top 10 movies from the Cannes Film Festival.) About those conventions Claire is not technically the heroine. That role falls to cat-eyed Amanda Seyfried an appealingly offbeat ingenue starring in her third movie to be released this year (and the only decent one following Dear John and Chloe). She plays Sophie a winsome fact checker at The New Yorker who goes to Verona on vacation with her fiance Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal impish and fun in a thankless role) a chef whose idea of an Italian holiday includes cheese wine and olive oil tastings. Instead of getting fat and happy with cute Victor Sophie is insane enough to be dreaming of -- wait for it -- journalism (and this isnt a period piece). In the back of her mind is the hope of a story that will elevate her to Susan Orlean-status with Bobby (Oliver Platt) the magazines editor. Sophie stumbles onto a bizarre real-life tradition in Verona home of Shakespeares Capulets and Montagues. Young women write letters to Juliet seeking counsel in matters of the heart from Romeos doomed love (presumably although who knows? Some may ask for help with math) and deposit them under the prototype of her famous balcony. For decades a fleet of Juliets ""secretaries"" have been answering these letters. While this phenomenon seems more suited to the pages of O The Oprah Magazine Sophie sees it as New Yorker material. (See the 100 best movies of all time.) What brings her into contact with Claire is a letter left in the wall many decades ago when Claire was a teenager waffling over what to do about an attraction to a fabulous young Italian named Lorenzo. Sophie responds as Juliets secretary urging her to follow her heart -- if it is still ticking -- and within days Claire shows up in Verona with her grandson Charlie (Chris Egan who bears a resemblance to fellow Aussie Heath Ledger). On our behalf Claire expresses surprise that Claire was so easy to find and Charlie supplies the reason ""We Brits tend to stay in our family homes."" He it must be said is a supercilious young prig. But Sophie and Claire are kindred spirits romantics perfectly matched to take on a driving tour of Italy looking for Lorenzo wherever he might have landed. (Victor is still conveniently distracted with gourmet pursuits.) This trio takes to the road traveling to various locations throughout Tuscany and the Veneto where they find many Lorenzos including one played by Redgraves real-life husband Franco Nero. Along the way Charlie drinks some wine and loosens up a bit. His chemistry with Sophie lacks sexual spark and tends too much to the innocent to take seriously -- but the truth is if I were Sophie Id take Charlie if only to get to his awesome grandmother. Shed made a fine mentor the kind who might inspire greatness from an aspiring young writer. (See TIMEs interview with Vanessa Redgrave.) Redgrave signed onto the movie shortly after losing her daughter actress Natasha Richardson in a ski accident. Its hard to know whether her grave dignified but exceedingly kind performance is that much more poignant because we can guess at what she was going through. Regardless I was surprised when I choked up during a scene where Claire quietly lovingly brushes Sophies hair. Its probably not the best indication of Letters to Juliets romantic weight that the most heartfelt love affair here is the one between Sophie and Claire. But Id take any woman in my life ages 10 to 100 to Letters to Juliet and my guess is wed both leave with a little Italian glow.

"Letters to Juliet Little poetry in ode to Bard | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLetters to Juliet Little poetry in ode to BardLetters to Juliet is a listless romantic comedy that purports to honour one of the Bards most famous characters.Vanessa Redgrave left and Amanda Seyfried star in Letters to Juliet.  (John P. Johnson)  Amanda Seyfried as Sophie at the real-life tourist shrine to Shakespeares Juliet Capulet.  (John P. Johnson)  By Jason AndersonSpecial to the StarThu. May 13 2010Letters to Juliet (out of 4)Starring Amanda Seyfried Christopher Egan and Vanessa Redgrave. Directed by Gary Winick. 95 minutes. At major theatres. PGAn enchanted island a vengeful ghost cross-dressers -- really there are any number of story devices that William Shakespeare might have used to enliven Letters to Juliet a listless romantic comedy that purports to honour one of the Bards most famous characters.That would be Juliet Capulet a fictional resident of the real Italian town of Verona. Also real are Juliets ""secretaries"" women who collect and answer the letters that lovelorn ladies send to Juliet in the hopes that Romeos squeeze can somehow alleviate their woes.Article Continued BelowIn Letters to Juliet this tradition comes to the attention of another fictional young woman Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) a fact checker and aspiring writer for The New Yorker who has come to Verona on a pre-honeymoon trip.Left on her own while her restaurateur-fiance (Gael Garcia Bernal) searches for wine bargains Sophie becomes fascinated with this volunteer brigade of advice-dispensers and takes it upon herself to craft a response to a letter that went unnoticed for 50 years.Sophies put in a potentially awkward position when the recipient of that missive returns from England to Verona seeking the lover she regretfully fled so many years before. Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) is convinced that her true love Lorenzo still lives somewhere in Tuscany and Sophie is eager to aid in her search much to the displeasure of Charlie (Christopher Egan) Claires skeptical yet not unhandsome grandson.That Sophie and Charlie take a firm dislike to each other is hardly a surprise. Indeed their bickering -- which of course soon gives way to softer words -- is one of many aspects of the film that might have been improved had the Bard been around for a rewrite.As it stands Letters to Juliet offers little to viewers besides many trite truisms about the ways of the heart some sumptuous views of the Tuscan countryside and a lovely performance by Redgrave. Still luminous at the age of 73 she has little trouble outshining and upstaging the younger leads. That her real-life husband --Italian screen legend Franco Nero -- plays her dear Lorenzo is a sweet touch.To be fair Seyfried and Egan cant do much with their thinly conceived characters and sub-sitcom banter. And what with Sophie and Charlies own romance being a foregone conclusion from the moment they trade their first barbs its a challenge to sit through the films poorly contrived efforts to postpone their happy union.Perhaps some helpful apothecary has a concoction that would allow moviegoers to sleep during Letters to Juliets more tedious stretches and rouse them for Redgraves appearances. Then again a certain young Capulet would advise against experimenting with potions lest they lead to tragic misunderstandings.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

This wise and beautiful little film is about two lovers falling from a state of grace. Watch a clip of Paramounts ""Like Crazy."" The outward impediment to their romance is a bureaucratic tangle. Anna (Felicity Jones) a vivacious young Englishwoman in her senior year at a California college falls in love with Jacob (Anton Yelchin) a touchingly tender young American whos been studying furniture design. After graduation she overstays her student visa by a couple of months to spend the summer with him. After a quick trip home to visit her parents Anna returns to California where U.S. immigration officials discover her visa violation refuse her entry and put her on the next flight back to London. At a time when illegal immigration is a hot-button topic Annas troubles might seem trivial. But her offense and the complicated long-distance relationship that ensues are only pretexts for a heartbreaking study of passionate love that deprived of proximity turn into confusion little lies on both sides then bigger lies and worst of all self-betrayal. ENLARGE Anton Yelchin and Felicity Jones in Like Crazy. Paramount Vantage ""Like Crazy"" was directed by Drake Doremus who wrote the script with Ben York Jones. Yet the written words arent necessarily the ones that come out of the actors mouths since most of the dialogue was improvised. I didnt realize that going in. I try to know as little as possible about a given film in advance of seeing it and this one undercut my conviction that actors improvisations lead more often than not to spontaneous banality. (My assumption about John Guleserians beautiful cinematography was similarly upset. I would have bet that hed shot on 35mm film. In fact he used the video function of a Canon EOS 7D a digital still camera that sells on the consumer market for about 1500 plus lenses and often travels on vacationers necks.) Ms. Jones and Mr. Yelchin are spontaneous all right. So too are Jennifer Lawrence as Jacobs fallback girlfriend (though I wish shed had a more substantial role) and Alex Kingston and Oliver Muirhead as Annas parents. But Anna and Jacob are also eloquent in their respective ways--Ms. Jones with her very English verbal fluency Mr. Yelchin with his very American syntactic vagueness--and all the more so in the silence of their expressions. Seldom has a script found such resonance in its lovers eyes body language and inward gazes. At one point in their relationship with Anna stuck in England while the U.S. Embassy reviews her case Jacob gives her a silver bracelet engraved with one word Patience. The same advice applies to moviegoers. ""Like Crazy"" develops slowly and threatens at first to be just another movie about beautiful young people in the Age of Fraught Relationships. Its much more than that though. Without belaboring any issues it speaks volumes about fear of commitment--Annas father offers the cheerfully old-fashioned suggestion that she and Jacob solve her visa problem by getting married--about inconstancy in any age about anxiety bred of mendacity about the dangers as well as the pleasures of impulsivity and the mystery of what if anything a pledge of love means. Patience pays off at least for us. Watch a film clip of director Chris Millers new animation movie ""Puss in Boots"" starring Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek. Clip Courtesy of DreamWorks. Puss in Boots Dont think of this charming 3-D animated feature as a spin-off from ""Shrek"" so much as a lift-off for the swashbuckling feline voiced by Antonio Banderas. Puss made his debut in ""Shrek 2"" then did time in the two decreasingly funny sequels. Now hes got a movie of his own and not a moment too soon. ""Puss in Boots"" exults in extravagant images while Mr. Banderas makes its hero--""Poos"" as his name is pronounced by most of the Spanish-accented characters--a paragon of sophisticated wit. You cant help but smile at his first Zorro-esque line accompanied by a guitar strum ""Through the years I have been known by many names."" And you sense a bright comic imagination at work when he bellies up to a bar orders milk and purrs ""I am but a humble gato looking for his next meal."" ENLARGE The titular feline swashbuckler in Puss in Boots. DreamWorks Animation A dramatic imagination is another story. The plot is little more than a string of collisions and events with a Tom-and-Jerry flavor that gets seriously diluted over the course of 90 minutes. Puss teams up with Humpty Dumpty (a creepily epicene ovoid voiced with eerie plaintiveness by Zach Galifianakis) to repay an old debt by stealing some magic beans from Jack and Jill. Along the way they climb a beanstalk that looks like a sky-scraping strand of DNA encounter a baby goose noticeably smaller than the golden eggs it lays a mother goose with the dimensions and disposition of King Kong and Kitty Softpaws a sexy cat burglar--that is to say a cat who burgles preferably by picking pockets-- played by Salma Hayek. When Puss and Kitty meet they throw themselves into a showstopper of a flamenco dance fight and do an equally effective reprise awhile later. But it isnt quite correct to say they stop the show which constantly functions in fits and starts--appealing set pieces inspired displays of animation (almost too much of too many brilliant things) and above all a performance by Mr. Banderas that defines the essence of droll. His voice is the gatos meow. Anonymous Watch a clip of Roland Emmerichs political thriller ""Anonymous"". Video courtesy of Sony/Columbia. Roland Emmerich has all but ended the world in such action spectaculars as ""Independence Day"" ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""2012."" In ""Anonymous"" he extinguishes literary scholarship by contending that Shakespeares plays were written by Edward de Vere Earl of Oxford. So all right then thats taken care of. Edward (played by Rhys Ifans) is the man we should have been honoring all along and Will Shakespeare an amiable buffoon as well as an indifferent actor took credit where it wasnt due. One problem with ""Anonymous"" though is what it says about the writers trade. Shakespeare--I mean Edward--is an unhappy man. ""The voices"" he cries. ""I cant stop them I would go mad if I didnt write down the voices."" He gets no sympathy from his wife. ""My God"" she says with disgust ""youre writing again."" And toward the end of his life he muses glumly ""Words merely words will be my sole legacy."" Didnt he even have fun writing his comedies? ENLARGE Rhys Ifans in Anonymous. Columbia Pictures A bigger problem with ""Anonymous"" is its opacity. The nonsensical notion of Edwards authorship is hardly more than a subplot. (He decided to hide it according to John Orloffs screenplay--which was actually written by whom?--out of fear that his plays were dangerously critical of powerful figures in Queen Elizabeths court.) Most of the movie is devoted to the Essex Rebellion against the queen and the action hops back and forth in time so befuddlingly with the same set of characters played by different actors that I defy anyone who isnt a scholar of the period to understand whats going on. (Which is not to suggest that I did.) Joely Richardson is engaging as the young queen but her mother Vanessa Redgrave is something else as Queen Bess in her powdered dotage. That something varies from moment to moment scene to scene. Sometimes shes distracted to the point of dottiness sometimes shes sharp as a tack and still seductive. In a movie that rings false at every turn Ms. Redgraves Elizabeth is truly and infallibly regal. In Time Andrew Niccols ""In Time"" looks great sounds stilted and plays like a clever videogame with too many rules. The premise builds on the notion that time is money. In the movies dystopian future where todays cars have tomorrows grilles time has replaced money. People are born with genetic clocks that stop at the age of 25; after that theyve got one year in which to beg borrow steal or even earn more time. If they dont the digital clocks embedded in their forearms dwindle down to zero and they time out i.e. die. Thats clever right? But then there are roving gangs called Minute Men (Teddy Boy types out of ""A Clockwork Orange"") who steal time; the borderline-silly spectacle of almost everyone looking 25; the polemic element of social injustice (the richest of the rich can live forever because theyve got eons socked away); and the action-adventure element a clumsy amalgam of Robin Hood ""Bonnie and Clyde"" ""The Avengers"" ""Les Miserables"" ""Dick Tracy"" (for the color and graphics) and Mr. Niccols earlier and impressive genetic-engineering opus ""Gattaca."" Amanda Seyfried and Justin Timberlake are the Bonnie and Clyde stand-ins though Ms. Seyfrieds makeup and wig suggest Anna Karina in an old Godard film. Its hard to judge their performances since they were clearly encouraged to be as stylized as the photography and sets by a director who given the evidence on screen came up short in the department of humor and was tone deaf to their American accents. (The English Minute Men sound fine.) It couldnt be easier on the other hand to judge Roger Deakinss cinematography Alex McDowells production design or Colleen Atwoods costumes; theyre all top-notch. Still one question lingers. In a film shot in and around Los Angeles why do all the car chases through all of the fictional regions time zones look like they were staged on the same venerable bridge across the Los Angeles River? ENLARGE Charlie Bartlett (2007) Charlie is a precocious young high-school student who both pops and pushes pills and Anton Yelchin plays him as a rich overmedicated Candide. The kids stash of the stuff is so copious thanks to an indulgent psychiatrist that he starts sharing it with his schoolmates and dispensing therapy along with the pills in the boys room. The cast includes Hope Davis at her best as Charlies libidinous mother Robert Downey Jr. as the schools bibulous principal and Kat Dennings as his daughter. Jon Poll directed from a script by Gustin Nash. The cinematographer was the estimable Paul Sarossy. Shakespeare in Love (1998) The Earl of Oxford may have written this too but Marc Norman and Tom Stoppard got screen credit for what is by unanimous agreement among Shakespearean scholars a totally fictional account of how a Bard with writers block sought help from a shrink (who timed patients sessions with an hourglass) and churned out ""Romeo and Juliet"" only after discovering his muse in a dishy brainy aristocrat named Lady Viola. Joseph Fiennes is Will Gwyneth Paltrow is Viola Geoffrey Rush is Philip Henslowe Shakespeares frantic gap-toothed producer and Judi Dench is the formidable Queen Elizabeth. The director was John Madden. Letters to Juliet (2010) Im not in love with this confection but I couldnt resist its intersections with ""Anonymous"" and ""In Time"" too. Amanda Seyfrieds Sophie a New Yorker magazine fact-checker goes to Verona to join volunteers who answer a ceaseless stream of letters addressed to Juliet. (The letter part is true.) She uncovers one written by an ardent English girl who is now a septuagenarian played by Vanessa Redgrave. And played so wonderfully well that watching her in action is like sitting in on a master class. Gary Winick directed from a cloying script by Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivan.

"Movie review Letters to Juliet will melt your heart with saccharine and the Tuscan sun - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-LettersMovie review Letters to Juliet will melt your heart with saccharine and the Tuscan sunAmanda Seyfried stars as a woman who tries to reunite lovers from half a century before played by Vanessa Redgrave and Franco Nero.May 14 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Letters to Juliet"" is an ode to romance of the most starry-eyed sort a sugary paean to quixotic clichA(c)s and a film destined to be a guilty pleasure for some (me included sigh) and the painful price of a relationship for others (so steel yourselves). The starry eyes here belong to Amanda Seyfried one of Hollywoods favorite ingA(c)nues now. But soon enough the movie morphs into a multigenerational romance-Italian road trip with Vanessa Redgrave Christopher Egan and Franco Nero to say nothing of certain members of the audience bitten by the bug. But love doesnt guarantee happy endings particularly when the tale is tied to Shakespeares ""Romeo and Juliet"" and the Verona balcony wherefore the star-crossed lovers he conjured up once cooed. In the years since the Bard wrote the broken-hearted began making pilgrimages there tucking lovelorn letters into the wall below with ""Juliets secretaries"" a local cohort of sympathetic souls answering each one. This is where Seyfrieds Sophie finds herself a a hopeless romantic under the spell of that balcony and moved by all those remnants of desire left behind. After discovering a 50-year-old missive from a Londoner named Claire (Redgrave) who wonders if she was right to leave her Italian lover Sophie sets about to pen the answer herself. That Sophie is a fact-checker at the New Yorker with dreams of becoming a writer is beside the point (just as her fiancA(c) Victor played Gael GarcAa Bernal is but a rock on the rocky road of love). But nevertheless the point is made many times over this being a Gary Winick movie. The director who staged last years wedding dress smackdown "" Bride Wars"" is not shy about milking moments. In ""Letters"" much of the milking takes place on balconies; I stopped counting at three. Screenwriters Jose Rivera (""The Motorcycle Diaries"") and Tim Sullivan dont help things by piling on more saccharine than substance and some truly groan inducing lines that severely test this appealing casts appeal. Because the film is operating on movie time not real time as anyone who has ever mailed a postcard from Italy knows this is what happens in the same week that Sophie replies to Claires letter It is delivered in London to Claire who reads it and immediately comes to Verona with her handsome but grating grandson Charlie (Egan) who tracks down then dresses down Sophie who follows him and meets Claire who invites Sophie to dinner. Sophie asks if she can tag along as Claire and Charlie search Tuscany for the long-lost Lorenzo who happens to have a very common name and thats far from the end of the story. Softening all the low blows is the presence of Redgrave and the warmth of the Tuscan sun. Between them they should melt the most resistant heart as Claire Sophie and Charlie meander through the lush languid countryside with its rolling vineyards and rustic villages. Cinematographer Marco Pontecorvo ( ""My One and Only"") has bathed everything in a golden glow that Redgrave floats through luminous still limpid blue eyes cheekbones ever at the ready absorbing whatever the day hands her which is usually a glass of wine and another Lorenzo. Just not the right Lorenzo. Seyfried and Egan are more charming when they are with her as they spar and deny the sparks that fly around them a she is engaged to Victor after all. But the time Redgrave spends on screen with Nero her longtime partner in real life is so infused with a slow-burning fire it could make a cynic or a critic waver so I will.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint LETTERS TO JULIET  out of four stars Rating PG for brief rude behavior and sensual images some language and incidental smoking. ""Letters to Juliet"" is a torn-between-two-lovers toss-off that makes a fatal miscalculation. Well more than one but first things first. If you are going to have Amanda Seyfried choose between suitors (Aroogha Spoiler Warning) do not cast the more interesting and lively actor in the loser role. Ladies I put it to you. Bachelor No. 1 is the handsome and vivacious Gael Garcia Bernal charismatic star of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""The Motorcycle Diaries."" Bachelor No. 2 is Christopher Egan an English yutz who has done some TV. Which one would you want to be pinned beneath? Seyfried plays a magazine researcher on vacation in Italy with Bernal her restaurateur fiance. She falls in with a group of ladies who mail advice to visitors who leave notes at the Verona home of Juliet Capulet. Discovering a decades-old note in which Vanessa Redgrave sighs over her lost Italian love Seyfried urges her to seek him out and tags along as she scours Tuscany in search of Lorenzo. Doing the driving is Redgraves priggish disapproving nephew Egan. The film consists of the trio driving around knocking on doors and not finding their man. Not right away at least. Seyfried and Egan banter abrasively. For all the romantic heat they project they may as well be acting opposite green-screen holograms. This one burns going down like cheap Chianti. Woodenly directed by Gary Winick (the felon responsible for last years hideous ""Bride Wars""). COLIN COVERT Fox Searchlight Associated Press - Ap Common and Queen Latifah in ""Just Wright."" just wright  1/2 out of four stars Rating PG for some suggestive material and brief language. I like Queen Latifah. I like her smile her charm her big singing voice her life force the survivor instinct that has kept her a viable star while Whitney Houston and Halle Berry have flamed out. I do not like her taste in movie roles. She hasnt starred in a good movie since ""Set It Off"" in 1996. The hard-luck streak extends through her latest the generic ""Just Wright."" Even the title announces ""Were not really making an effort here."" She plays a good-natured New Jersey girl physical therapist by day and avid fan of the Nets by night. Fate and feeble screenwriting place her in a romantic triangle with the basketball teams star player (hip-hop star Common) and her own pretty blithely materialistic cousin (Paula Patton). The relationship between the singers is sad to say seriously off-key. Latifah coaches Common through a career-threatening knee injury but his real problem is lack of spine or perhaps misplaced crown jewels. He shuttles between the cousins as passive as a badminton birdie. He is given to declaring his love on bended knee amid large crowds. He also wears several tears painted onto his cheeks by the makeup department. This I submit is hooey. One does not make it big in the NBA by being a softhearted mooncalf. For a brief moment (""Chicago"" 2002) it seemed that Latifah might be getting her movie career on track. Then came the numbskull Steve Martin comedy ""Bringing Down the House"" ""Scary Movie 3"" ""Mad Money"" and now this. Forget twisted knees. Choices like those are career-threatening injuries.

The story focuses on love letters sent to the mailbox of Shakespeares fictional Juliet.By Carrie Rickey Inquirer Movie CriticPosted May 14 2010Letters to Juliet a quasi-romantic comedy about old love and new love is notable for the earthy beauty of Amanda Seyfried the ethereal loveliness of Vanessa Redgrave and the postcard charm of Verona Italy.Its also a case of art imitates life imitates art. If that makes it a tribute to a tribute to a classic then it is no less enjoyable for that.First the backstory Since the release of the 1936 film of Romeo and Juliet missives from real-life lovelorn have flooded the Verona mailbox of Shakespeares fictional Juliet.Visitors likewise tuck notes in between the stones of the Gothic wall at Juliets supposed home. Thanks to local volunteers each ""Dear Juliet"" epistle posted at Loves Wailing Wall is answered offering helpful advice.Enter Sophie (Seyfried) an aspiring New York writer on holiday in Verona with her fiance Victor (Gael GarcAa Bernal).First she stumbles upon the volunteer Juliets and then upon a note left by an English girl at Juliets house half a century earlier. Since the letter is in English the volunteers recruit Sophie to answer it. And given the English aristocracys custom of never leaving their ancestral homes the return address is still good.Did I mention that Sophies fiance is a chef more interested in noodling with his Italian wine and cheese vendors than in canoodling with Sophie? And that Claire (Redgrave) author of the missive answered by Sophie comes to Verona her thirtyish grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) in tow? Claire now a widow is moved by Sophies letter to find her first love one Lorenzo Bertolini.Anyone over age 10 knows exactly where this movie is going. And director Gary Winick (maker of the charming 13 Going on 30 and the charmless Bride Wars) makes sure that on its way there it kisses every sunflower and samples from every vineyard in Italys Veneto region.With movie choices like Mean Girls Mamma Mia and Dear John Seyfried is positioned to become the next Julia Roberts. The younger actress is wide-eyed spirited and wistful and like the older one has terrific rapport with mature actors a useful credential. Seyfried (as the motherless Sophie) and Redgrave (as the daughterless Claire) share a sympathy that warms the film like the summer sun.And Redgrave Slim and silvery as lightning she is always a revelation. She accelerates the movie by slowing down to silent stillness in order fully to hear - and carefully digest - what others do and say. When she looks in the eyes of a costar she plumbs his soul.That one of the Lorenzos here happens to be Franco Nero her real-life husband (and Lancelot to her Guinevere in the 1967 film version of Camelot) adds a layer of art-imitating-life frosting to the cake. Letters to Juliet  (out of four stars) Directed by Gary Winick with Vanessa Redgrave Amanda Seyfried and Gael GarcAa Bernal. Distributed by Summit Films.Running time 1 hour 45 mins.Parents guide PG (rude behavior nothing unsuitable for romantics).Showing at area theaters.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Remember that diamond commercial with the young couple in the park looking longingly at the elderly couple walking past them holding hands? Someones gone and turned it into a feature film -- splicing in a good chunk of ""Under the Tuscan Sun for insurance -- and what was touching at 30 seconds is a groaner at 105 minutes.Thats not entirely fair. You dont have to be 13 and a tapioca-brained romantic to enjoy ""Letters to Juliet. But it would help.The movies the second heart-tugger in three months to feature Amanda Seyfried (""Dear John) the latest ingenue to be anointed an up-and-coming star. Honestly theres nothing wrong with ""Juliet that a better deeper actress wouldnt fix. (And a script. A script would be nice.) With her platinum waterfall of hair and big tweety-bird eyes Seyfried offers a vision of youthful loveliness that ceases the moment she opens her mouth to deliver lines in the broad affectless tones of a weather girl.She plays Sophie a fact-checker at a spurious Hollywood version of The New Yorker (Oliver Platts her harrumph-y boss) who heads to Verona on a pre-honeymoon with her fiance and gets sidetracked on a story. Drawn to the lonelyhearts notes pinned to the courtyard wall at the Casa di Giulietta -- supposedly the home of the real Juliet Capulet of ""Romeo and Juliet -- Sophie discovers a 50-year-old letter hidden behind a brick and decides to answer it.The letter was written by a young Englishwoman named Claire heartbroken over leaving her Italian one true love. On receiving Sophies reply Claire descends upon Verona in the person of Vanessa Redgrave who exudes so much grace talent and class that Seyfried is immediately reduced to an acting-school Munchkin. Really the movie itself never quite recovers.Claire has brought along her skeptical grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) and the threesome scour Tuscany by car for the lost love one Lorenzo Bartolini. It turns out there are many many Lorenzo Bartolinis in the area and the best joke in the movie is that theyre all willing to pick up with Claire where they never left off.Sophie and Charlie hate each other of course which means that they love each other of course. ""Letters to Juliet clanks along the tracks of romantic-comedy confusion with grim predictability The moon is always full and the Italian locations are gorgeous or would be if they werent overlit like a trattoria poster. But maybe its wrong to expect Continental nuance from a film that ends with a Taylor Swift song.The larger problem is that the central duo is just plain dull. Egans Charlie is a wooden Englishman and Sophie is a gauche underwritten character that only an Anne Hathaway might (I say might) be able to flesh out. When Claire asks her grandson ""How many Sophies do you think there are on the planet? its difficult not to think About 6 million on the East Coast alone. Thats probably why the movie will be a hit.Adding to the general air of absurdity the fiance -- an excitable self-absorbed chef named Victor -- is played by the Mexican actor-hunk Gael Garcia Bernal and were asked to believe that any sane woman would throw this guy over for the stiff-backed Egan. Victor loves wine cheese truffles life and for that the movie punishes him.It punishes us with dialogue to make a Nicholas Sparks fan wince (""When were speaking of love its never too late . . . ) and Gary Winicks mechanical uninspired direction. Late in the going were treated to a reunion of Redgrave with Franco Nero the Lancelot to her Guenevere in 1967s ""Camelot and the ease with which these two portray mature passion is deeply touching. If only the movie were interested. ""Letters to Juliet makes the case that even boring young nincompoops deserve love.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For four Euros visitors to fair Verona--where Letters To Juliet lays its scene--can visit a house called La Casa Di Giulietta said to have inspired Shakespeares Romeo And Juliet. True said inspiration exists entirely in the mind of whoever first thought to add a balcony to a medieval inn in 1936 and start charging admission but that doesnt stop tourists from showing up and indulging the manufactured tradition of rubbing the breast of a Juliet statue for luck and leaving love letters hanging from a wall. What becomes of said letters? As yet nothing good. They inspired a ponderous 1993 Elvis Costello album and now theres Letters To Juliet in which a vacationing Amanda Seyfried falls in with the Secretaries Of Juliet a group of women who set about answering the eponymous letters with homespun advice. A New Yorker fact-checker with writing ambitions Seyfried winds up with plenty of time on her hands while vacationing in Italy with fiancee Gael Garcia Bernal a chef who responds to food with the comical enthusiasm of a Tex Avery character and appears bored by just about everything else. While he traipses off to check out a wine auction Seyfried starts responding to Juliets correspondents. Shes particularly drawn to a long-lost letter from the 1950s written by an Englishwoman who chose to abandon the teenage love of her life. Seyfried is surprised to find the letter then even more surprised when the woman shows up (played by Vanessa Redgrave) accompanied by her priggish handsome grandson (Christopher Egan) with whom Seyfried develops an instantly antagonistic relationship. Together they hit the road looking for Redgraves long-lost love. Those already connecting the dots as to who ends up with whom get no extra points. Not that that should matter. If well done a film like Letters To Juliet should need no surprises. But it does need more than the postcard-ready vistas against which director Gary Winick (13 Going On 30) frames much of the action. Thats a smart choice as is giving Redgrave a generous amount of screen time but no amount of pretty scenery and grand-dame gravity can make up for the complete absence of chemistry between Seyfried and Egan. Her dewy romanticism and his Oxbridge stuffiness pair as well as pasta primavera and Faygo and both seem at a loss as to how to improve a clunker-laden script or push a film thats content to move at a parcel-post pace.

Letters to Juliet Director Gary Winick. Cast Amanda Seyfried Vanessa Redgrave Christopher Egan. Rating PG for brief rude behavior some language and incidental smoking. RELATED Chick flicks Travel movies In the case of Victor the ""Top Chef"" fantasy heartthrob in this paint-by-numbers romance its not video games that lure him from his doe-eyed fiancee but gustatory sensation. Played by Mexican indie idol Gael Garcia Bernal Victor is taking his blond beauty Sophie (Amanda Seyfried) on a ""pre-honeymoon"" in Italy but he spends all his time tasting wines and learning rustic recipes. As the ultimate foodie his oral fixations leave little time to feign interest in Sophies passions. While shes talking about her dream of being a writer hes losing himself in another cheesegasm. She tries to be supportive but finally she puts her foot down ""I dont know why you want to travel 120 kilometers to see a mushroom."" While the relationship with her narcissistic Mr. Wrong slowly unravels Sophie discovers a 50-year-old ""letter to Juliet"" left at a sort of shrine to Shakespeares doomed heroine in the fair city of Verona where we lay our scene. With the permission of ""Juliets secretaries"" who answer the flood of missives posted on the wall there Sophie writes a reply and before long shes helping a stately Englishwoman (Vanessa Redgrave) search for the long-lost love of her youth - over the objections of her overprotective grandson (the sandy-haired Aussie Christopher Egan). Could that prickly Brit who turns his nose up at Sophies casual Americanisms (""Awesome"") actually be Mr. Right? Well duh Seyfried - who played another Sophie in ""Mamma Mia"" - does little more than stand around looking pretty and even the inestimable Redgrave isnt given much of a character to work with. Her Claire somewhere in the mushy middle between proper and eccentric British has had some tough breaks her grandson tells us but we dont really know what they were because despite her declaration that ""life is the messy bits"" all the messiness in these characters lives (such as Claires first husband) have all been conveniently removed so they dont get in the way of the predictable story lines. That ""Letters to Juliet"" is lost in a gooey dreamland is all too obvious when Claire finally finds her beloved Lorenzo - only after she has given up looking of course. He comes riding picturesquely through the vineyard with his distinguished graying beard like an Italian version of the Most Interesting Man in the World from those awful Dos Equis beer commercials. Of course you cant have a movie inspired by ""Romeo and Juliet"" without a balcony scene and when it finally comes its exactly what you think its going to be. Which is OK. Thats why you put this title on your Netflix queue in the first place. Just give your own Mr. Right a break and dont waste your date-night dollars on the big screen.

Comments Letters to Juliet Video Rated PG  105 minutes  2010 Vanessa Redgrave bails out this mushy Italian-postcard romance from director Gary Winick (13 Going On 30). The title refers to a wall in Verona where lovelorn women post letters seeking advice from the Shakespeare character; these missives are collected and answered by a little team of counselors. Amanda Seyfried stars as a fact-checker for the New Yorker who finds Redgraves 50-year-old letter hidden in the wall and hoping to write a story sets out to reunite the old Brit with the Italian hunk she was separated from as a young woman. This swoony tale is augmented by a flaccid love triangle in which Seyfrieds character is tempted from her self-absorbed fiance (Gael Garcia Bernal) by the womans caustic but of course really very sweet nephew (Christopher Egan). Anyone who considers this a decent romance should check out Max Ophulss Letter From an Unknown Woman. By J.R.

How excessively dolce is this cinematic wish-fulfillment fantasy composed as a sonnet (with a pop-song backbeat) to good wine beautiful people Italian vineyards the enduring power of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet and the enduring love between Vanessa Redgrave and Italian actor Franco Nero? Let me put it this way Its so shamelessly dreamy that not only does flaxen-haired Sophie (Amanda Seyfried kissed by the camera) an aspiring writer with a mismatched fiance find true love on the sun-dappled back roads of Tuscany but she also gets published in The New Yorker On her first try Redgrave shimmers like one of Tuscanys magnificent cypress trees as an Englishwoman searching for Lorenzo (Nero) the Italian man she loved a half century earlier; generic Australian cutie Christopher Egan plays the strapping grandson by her side. (Its a fantastical world indeed when Gael Garcia Bernal plays the wrong man for fair Sophie.) But soft Director Gary Winick and cinematographer Marco Pontecorvo fit together the fate-tossed stuff of mass-appeal love stories and the seductive imagery of travelogue vacation movies so smoothly that the sequel to Letters to Juliet might well be Letters to Orbitz Find me a flight to Verona B+ See all of this weeks reviews Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories Sarah Jessica Parker New HBO show isnt Sex and the City HBO announces re-run premiere date for The Larry Sanders Show Stranger Things cast and fans scared with even Stranger prank HBO defends violent content as critics complain Nick Cannon says he was hit with Mariah Carey diss on Wild N Out True Detective not dead yet HBO insists Jimmy Fallon Snapchats Martha Stewarts cooking on The Tonight Show Photo Galleries 50Scoops50Days The Latest in Fall TV News The Biggest Moments From the 2016 Conventions Crazy Stupid Love Before They Were Stars The Most 2000s Fashion From John Tucker Must Die Exclusive Photos of The Walking Dead Season 7 27 Great Revenge Movies Alice in Wonderland Witticisms and Wisdom From the Disney Classic From Our Partners From Our Partners Contact UsCustomer ServiceAbout UsJobs at Time Inc.AdvertisePrivacy PolicyYour California Privacy RightsAd ChoicesNewslettersSubscribeTerms of ServiceSite Map Copyright (c) 2016 Entertainment Weekly Inc.

But Sophies not satisfied She really wants to write an ambition that sets the eyes of both boyfriend and boss aglaze. When Victor seems more interested in spending their Italian vacation hunting for truffles than digging her Sophie drifts off and ends up in Verona at the mythic home of Shakespeares Juliet where a cadre of volunteer secretaries answer letters left behind by lovelorns. Soon Sophies tagging along as English widow Claire (Vanessa Redgrave) visits a roundelay of Italian geezers to find the farmhand she loved and left back in the 50s. Enter Claires no-fun lawyer grandson Charlie (Christopher Egan) whose interest in Sophies writing makes up for his post-schoolboy prissiness. Juliets core messages--date boys who are cool with you having a career and dont settle; NYC wine snobs are selfish but guys who grow grapes and/or do pro bono legal work will love you forever--are inoffensive but theyre hardly the stuff of swooning fantasia. And fantasy Juliet clearly intends to be--too many plane tickets are booked last-minute without mention of the cost of the trip. Gary Winicks flat direction does the material no favors If Egan and Seyfried have any chemistry its framed out of their awkwardly staged climactic kisses.

Omigod she might choose Ralph Bellamy Thats one way to view ""Letters to Juliet"" as an inversion of ""His Girl Friday"" whose heroine unsurprisingly picked sexy fast-talking professional Cary Grant over stolid mamas boy Bellamy. Here Amanda Seyfried dissatisfied with adorable workaholic chef Gael Garcia Bernal leans toward upright uptight Brit Christopher Egan and his tag-along grandmum a luminous Vanessa Redgrave (the true object of her affection). But it remains to be seen whether auds will slog through Gary Winicks syrupy Italy-set romantic comedy to witness these indomitable femmes carry the day and the film when it bows May 14. Sophie (Seyfried) is a fact checker and wannabe writer at the New Yorker spending a Tuscan pre-honeymoon with fiance Victor (Bernal) who ignores her as he excitedly chases down exotic foodstuffs for his soon-to-open Manhattan eatery. In a fairly well-executed caricature turn Bernals Victor rhapsodizes about fabricating the perfect noodle as he meets with suppliers attends wine auctions and hunts down 300-year-old recipes across Italia leaving Sophie in the lurch. Stranded in a postcard-y Verona (the City of Love -- nudge nudge) Sophie visits the house of the fabled Juliet where weeping women pen lonely-hearts letters to the ill-fated lover and post them on the courtyard walls. Curious Sophie follows a woman she sees gathering up the notes and stumbles upon the secretaries of Juliet -- signoras of all ages and backgrounds who answer the plaintive missives; they invite Sophie to join them. Extricating an ancient letter from 1957 Sophie writes back summoning a hopeful Claire (Redgrave) and her peevish grandson Charlie (Egan). The trio then embark on a mission to uncover which of the 74 Lorenzo Bartolinis in Tuscany is Claires long-lost soulmate a comic opportunity director Winick (""Bride Wars"" ""13 Going on 30"") exploits only perfunctorily before revealing the right Lorenzo. Meanwhile of course the hostility between Sophie and Charlie slowly morphs into Something Else. ""Letters to Juliet"" is curiously sexless (the PG rating says it all) and its most sensually charged scene sees a motherly Claire brushing and caressing Sophies hair. Otherwise Sophie simply exchanges mad hugs with Victor and chaste kisses with Charlie. Pic similarly lacks any edge tension or credible relationship with the real world; Sophies story about Claires quest immediately gains her the respect of her boss (Oliver Platt) and an improbably secure writing gig while Charlies declaration of love as he climbs to Sophies balcony includes a vow to drop his law practice and follow her to New York a city he despises. Jose Rivera and Tim Sullivans script relentlessly piles on goopy conversation-stoppers like ""Do you believe in destiny?"" and ""I didnt know that true love had an expiration date."" Apparently unleavened schmaltz is best served on an Italian platter though among ""Juliets"" forebears even ""Only You"" admitted to its contrivances and ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" explored natives and expats to more engaging effect. Seyfried back in ""Mamma Mia"" territory after her walk on the wild side in Atom Egoyans Chloe brings an erotic tinge to her sassy girl-next-door innocence while Redgrave again proves positively radiant in her white-haired majesty. Bernals overeager chef remains cute even in his maddening obliviousness while Egans Charlie stays as stiffly wooden as a Lombardy poplar. Pics bouncy score is ever-present while scenic Tuscan drives border on the superficially picturesque.
