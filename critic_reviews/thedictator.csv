By David Denby Sacha Baron Cohen like Lenny Bruce who was always willing to turn the tables on his hip educated fans is not a nice boy.   Credit Illustration by Stan Chow Sacha Baron Cohen could be the Groucho Marx Sid Caesar and Lenny Bruce of his generation if he would define and discipline his art as they did. He has a long and lanky clowns body. Hes fearless and dangerously knowing. His comedy is as broad as a slap on the back but it also appeals to highbrows who get his allusions and enjoy his acting out the kind of shenanigans that they learned at sixteen to suppress. Incapable of shame he has the hard-driving ruthlessness of the most dedicated comics no part of him is protected from exposure and no one else is safe from him. First on television and then in movies Baron Cohen has inhabited various personae Ali G (an imbecilic English would-be rapper) Borat (an imbecilic Kazakh journalist) and Bruno (an imbecilic Austrian fashionista). Ali G a white suburbanite posing as a hip-hop media personality spoke in a jumbled vernacular--""Jafaican."" The others speak in a thickly accented linguistic fog (say Hebrew masquerading as Kazakh) from which spangled profanities erupt like flares. Stumbling around apparently hapless Baron Cohen conducted interviews with people who somehow never realized that they were talking to a calculating satirist a man with a malicious heart. His victims have included Euro fashion-world twits Hollywood hangers-on and a variety of politicians hungry for the camera including Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich. Some sued but the cases were thrown out. Promoting his new movie ""The Dictator"" he showed up on ""Saturday Night Live"" in the bedecked white uniform and thick black beard of his latest character Admiral General Aladeen the absolute leader of the North African state of Wadiya. He held up a blood-soaked rave review of the movie by the Times A. O. Scott extracted under torture and Roger Eberts two thumbs. In the mail a few days later the press received a cream-colored formally printed invitation for the ""premiere"" of the film to take place at Robert Mugabes Presidential residence (""Southwest Entrance"") in Zimbabwe. When Baron Cohen finishes a film he struts around in the guise of his peacocking dolts for months at a time turning routine promotional events into provocation and performance art. Hes now too famous to interview people in character so Aladeen is a straight acting performance. He speaks a highly fricative English (the consonants get stuck in the back of his throat); Baron Cohens use of Hebrew (this time for Arabic) is a tease and perhaps a weird kind of embrace. Aladeen is gleeful randy and threatening. (He greeted Seth Meyers on ""S.N.L."" with ""Hello Zionist"" extending his ring to be kissed.) The movie begins with a dedication--""In Loving Memory of Kim Jong-Il""--and throughout it pays homage to Muammar Qaddafi Saddam Hussein Osama bin Laden Idi Amin and Dick Cheney. Aladeen addresses his adoring followers while standing in front of a gold-fretted palace and insists on subservience from everyone including his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) who wants to get rid of him and sell off Wadiyas oil reserves. Tamir has Aladeen kidnapped and replaces him with a pliable double (also played by Baron Cohen) but the dictator escapes and in America beardless he becomes friends with a vegan activist Zoey (Anna Faris) who runs the Free Earth Collective an organic-produce store in Brooklyn. Zoey is perhaps a little addled by too much tofu. She thinks that Aladeen is a Wadiyan dissident even though he slaps her customers around. ""The Dictator"" turns into a love story of sorts Faris wide-eyed plays ardent and dumb; her Zoey somehow sees a kindly soul behind Aladeens imperious ways. Directed by Baron Cohens usual collaborator Larry Charles and written by Baron Cohen Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer the movie has the ramshackle loopiness of a Marx Brothers movie--in particular ""Duck Soup."" But the movie has a vicious edge that the Marx Brothers didnt have and its too low-minded to achieve their enchanting blend of anarchy and surrealism. Despite the presence of Kingsley and Faris Sacha Baron Cohen is pretty much the whole show. As Aladeen he has a crotch-forward chin-out walk and a fatuous donkey grin. The satire which quickly veers into spoof and essentially stays there is obvious enough. Dick Cheney aside the dictators revered in the movie are so grotesque in their whims obsessions and sexual vainglory that theyre already clowns. To reveal their true nature all you have to do is tweak their habitual behavior. Aladeen in his spare time plays terrorist video games (one is set at the 1972 Munich Olympics)--a throwaway joke that recalls bin Laden in his final years glued to the computer screen and the TV. When Aladeen sprints in his own Olympics he shoots the other runners with the starters gun a nod to Amins antics during a swimming race captured in Barbet Schroeders 1974 documentary about him. Offense and even anger are almost inevitable reactions to these unstable movies. In ""Bruno"" Baron Cohen made fun of flamboyant self-celebration; he also made gay sex grotesque as if it were the abomination that right-wingers denounce. His taunting comes close to a dare You think I am with you in disapproving of yahoos and homophobes but its not that simple. I will find your taboos and push your good will to the point of rejection. In other words Baron Cohen like Lenny Bruce who was always willing to turn the tables on his hip educated fans is not a nice boy. Bruce railed against injustice and hypocrisy but he also teased liberal do-goodism which he thought mere sentimentality. When people enjoyed his going low he went lower insisting for instance that Jacqueline Kennedy was trying to protect herself in Dallas not tend to her dying husband. Baron Cohen wants to inhabit the same danger zone in his relation to the audience and in his work too--hes frequently on the verge of being clobbered. He often attacks easy targets. Many of the Americans he goes after in ""Borat"" are rednecks and frat boys and hyper-patriots; they do represent however a broad swath of temperament and opinion in the United States. Similarly when Bruno attempts to make himself an instant Hollywood celebrity Baron Cohen interviews not stars or directors but people on the periphery of the industry--a third-level agent two ""charity consultants"" a psychic and other participants in the theatre of illusion that Nathanael West portrayed in ""The Day of the Locust."" This too is a recognizable America not so far from common dreams. Baron Cohen can be over-insistent but he has created a new kind of hostile satire and too stern a reading of his ethics or his consistency would destroy whats fresh as well as whats cruel in his work. Aladeen is a lesser creation than Borat and Bruno. ""The Dictator"" like its predecessors is short (eighty-three minutes) but it runs down fast and the lewd jokes pile up. One gag about a vagina complete with inside-the-womb visuals is more invasive than those probes that have recently been in the news. How could Baron Cohen whose antennae are usually so acute not have realized that the joke was stupid? When he is not teasing dictatorial megalomania he combines the British tradition of bawdy humor with the current American market demand for infantile burlesque--the ""American Pie"" world which he should now put behind him. At the moment hes at risk of turning into an erudite Howard Stern. Julian Schnabels great film ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" (2007) tells the real-life story of the late French magazine editor Jean-Dominique Bauby who suffered a stroke that left him almost totally paralyzed and was restored to sentience and creativity by the ministrations of two beautiful female therapists. Schnabel moved from Baubys limited view (only his left eye could move) to an ecstatic vision of his inner life and his fantasies. The French movie ""The Intouchables"" which is also based on a true story feels like a square version of Schnabels film. Philippe (Francois Cluzet) an aristocratic millionaire who lives in an art-laden mansion in Paris is left immobile after a paragliding accident. He hires as a caretaker a street thug born in Senegal Driss (Omar Sy) who treats him with an absence of pity that Philippe finds appealing and the two men racing around town in a black Maserati form a roguish friendship. Philippe is even amused when Driss mocks the high culture that he has lived for. The directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have their culture cake and dump it on the floor too the picture extolls classical music (theres a deluxe private concert) and disdains it at the same time. ""The Intouchables"" which was an enormous hit in France is propelled by a particular French sentimentality about savagery and civilization that goes back to Rousseau. (Driss isnt just kind--he turns out to have a genius for painting.) The plot as a result becomes disastrously condescending the black man whos crude sexy and a great dancer liberates the frozen white man. The handsome Omar Sy jumps all over the place and hes blunt and grating. Francois Cluzet acts with his eyebrows his nose his forehead. Its an admirable performance but the movie is an embarrassment.

Universal Studios By Joe Morgenstern May 17 2012 544 p.m. ET There comes a time in ""Battleship"" a board game gone megabudget-ballistic when the fate of our planet has seemingly been sealed by an attack from outer space. ""Were looking at an extinction-level event"" an astronomer declares and its hard to disagree what with the invaders stupendously powerful vessels and the impenetrable force fields that protect them. Around this time you may feel youre looking at another extinction-level event one that threatens the end of logic storytelling characterization hearing and maybe even the movie business as we know it. Still the planet is saved by a U.S. Navy lieutenant backed up by the Pacific fleet while the movie is enlivened now and then by lines that rise above intentional stupidity into inspired idiocy and by occasionally stunning imagery that cuts through the computer-generated clutter. The classic board game ""Battleship"" has been turned into a high-energy action flick starring Taylor Kitsch Alexander Skarsgard Rihanna Brooklyn Decker and Liam Neeson. Watch a clip from the film. Cideo Universal. The Earths savior Lt. Alex Hopper is played by Taylor Kitsch; he helped save Mars as John Carter in the recent misfortune of the same name. As a gifted young man whos made a mess of his life Alex is long overdue for redemption. When opportunity knocks however--hes suddenly asked to command the only ship inside the invaders force field--he first says ""I cant"" and thereby triggers a choice idiocy from a shipmate who responds plaintively ""If you cant who can?"" Like ""Transformers"" which it rivals in relentlessness ""Battleship"" comes with its own force field a furious energy that renders criticism irrelevant. Its still worth noting that something odd is going on in the sketchy story. One example involves an early sequence and an entertaining one about Alexs efforts to fetch a burrito for a beautiful woman who turns out to be the admirals daughter. (Shes played with flawless plasticity by Brooklyn Decker.) Next thing we know a few minutes later Alex is nervously preparing to ask the admiral (Liam Neeson) to approve their marriage. Conventional notions of development and continuity have been replaced by a narrative technique best likened to sampling discrete events along a timeline. Is that intentional? Surely not. Movies like this one directed by Peter Berg from a ragtag script by Erich Hoeber and Jon Hoeber are such huge industrial enterprises that no one can keep track of all the pieces. And will the core audience care or even notice? Probably not; nuance isnt the main attraction. But the same disjointed approach applies to the production design where serious short-changing takes place. ""Battleship"" contains some beautiful effects the devastation of Hong Kong the raising of the force fields and most notably the form and function of the alien vessels which suggest deranged Olympians doing the breast stroke. Yet those effects are sampled too in slices too thin to give sustenance. Polisse The film ""Polisse"" follows members of the child-protection unit of the Paris police force as they investigate cases of sexual deviancy. Watch a clip from the film. Video Sundance Selects. In police shows on TV the cops are stressed but essentially in control as they deal with perps and victims. The cops in ""Polisse"" members of a child-protection unit within the Paris police force can barely maintain their sanity let alone their equanimity. They live like a dysfunctional family while dealing with cases of sexual deviancy breathtaking ignorance or amorality plus the turbulence of their own sex lives. This astonishing French feature directed by Maiwenn from a script she wrote with Emmanuelle Bercot is based on cases from real life. Following the mosaic convention of TV procedurals it leaps from one crisis to another with an attention-deficit alacrity that occasionally borders on absurdity. But what makes it such a singular experience is the convergence of fine acting moral urgency and a willingness to linger on moments of great intensity. In one of them a smug Muslim man accused of child abuse is confronted by a female Muslim cop. The man insists theres nothing wrong with his pushing his underage daughter into an arranged marriage with her cousin back home. The cop responding with frustration and rage waves a copy of the Quran in his face. ""If youre a man and a good Muslim"" she shouts ""just tell me where it says a father can force his daughter to marry."" In another marvelous moment a cop named Fred holds a weeping boy in his arms and tries to console him. Of the many cases the child-protection people have been struggling with this one constitutes their most flagrant failure for they cant find a homeless shelter in all of Paris that will accept the boy together with his helpless mother. Fred embodies the movies moral and dramatic center. A passionately dedicated public servant though also a volatile and violent one hes played by the French rapper Joeystarr a burly figure whose tenderness put me in mind of Wallace Beery. Other cops include Karin Viards equally volatile Nadine Marina Foiss tortured Iris and the units morally malleable commander Beauchard (Wladimir Yordanoff). Maiwenn--who was born Maiwenn Le Besco--plays Melissa a photographer assigned to document the units activities. Like everyone else in the cast shes an excellent actor with a great director. The Dictator Comedian Sacha Baron Cohen takes on his newest persona of Admiral General Shabazz Aladeen in the movie ""The Dictator."" Watch a clip from the film. Video Paramount Pictures. Sacha Baron Cohens gleefully scabrous portrait of a fictional North African tyrant called Admiral General Aladeen starts high with a tribute to the memory of Kim Jong Il and tosses off some sensationally funny stuff before descending into a rat-a-tat rhythm of random insult and ritual vulgarity. Its a letdown and a loss. We can always use craziness on the level of Aladeen winning 14 gold medals in his own Olympic games by shooting other athletes. Theres even satirical value in the ghastliness of his asking a pregnant woman whether shes having a boy or an abortion. Vulgarity on the other hand is in ample supply; its merely dismaying to watch the bearded dictator dump his own urine on an Israeli ambassador while delivering a speech at the United Nations. In the 2006 mockumentary ""Borat"" Mr. Baron Cohen gave us a hero of triumphant imbecility played with the lechery of Groucho Marx and the taut anxiety of Alan Arkin. Three years later in ""Bruno"" he was less entertaining and sometimes downright embarrassing as a blond flamboyantly gay fashion journalist in lederhosen and Spandex. Last year in ""Hugo"" his formidable gifts as a performer were thwarted by clumsy direction and a conspicuous absence of fresh material. Now hes turning material both fresh and rancid into tepid gruel. In one scene an androgynous ultra-liberal at a health-food co-op teaches Aladeen to masturbate. Shes played charmingly by an all-but-unrecognizable Anna Faris and his reaction is blithely amusing ""Wait what sorcery is this?"" On the whole though ""The Dictator"" is much more masturbatory than ensorcelling.

Take our movie trivia quiz Video The Dictator trailer Monitor Movie Guide Having used up at least for now the improv characters he developed in ""Da Ali G Show"" Sacha Baron Cohen in ""The Dictator"" has created a new one the full-bearded Adm. Gen. Omar Aladeen tyrant of the North African nation of Wadiya. Hes the guy you know who spilled Kim Jong-ils ""ashes"" on Ryan Seacrest at the Academy Awards. (The film is dedicated to the memory of the late Korean dictator.)On the laughmeter ""The Dictator"" is closer to ""Borat"" than to the misfired ""Bruno"" which is to say its funny for about half of its brisk 83 minutes. This time out Baron Cohen is working with a script and professional actors throughout (including Ben Kingsley as a Wadiyan big shot) and the lack of improvisation is somewhat stifling. Hes at his best and most daring when hes riffing in unplanned situations.On the other hand I can understand why he didnt want to go into ""Borat"" mode with ""The Dictator."" As it is hell be lucky if he avoids a fatwa. Recommended Think youre a film buff? Take our movie trivia quiz The bulk of the film involves Aladeens visit to New York in preparation for a speech before the United Nations during which time he is replaced by an idiotic body double (also played by Baron Cohen) and falls in with a far-left activist (Anna Faris). Political correctness is at no time on the menu. In the end Aladeen delivers a speech equating Wadiyas despotism and Americas ""democracy."" Its like a negative image of the famous humanist speech at the conclusion of Charlie Chaplins ""The Great Dictator."" If Baron Cohen is going to continue making scripted comedies he needs to work with directors far less slapdash than Larry Charles (who did ""Borat"" and ""Bruno""). He can be one of the funniest people on the planet but he needs a real dictator - I mean director - calling the shots.

"The Dictator starring Sacha Baron Cohen reviewed Slate Sign In Sign Up Warning The Dictator May Sour You on Sacha Baron Cohen Warning The Dictator May Sour You on Sacha Baron Cohen Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.May 16 2012 559 PM The Dictator Sasha Baron Cohen goes soft. By Dana Stevens Sacha Baron Cohen in The Dictator Photograph (c) 2012 - Paramount Pictures. All rights reserved. I predict that The Dictator (Paramount) is the movie that will siphon off the casual Sacha Baron Cohen fans from the hardcore ones. People who spent the fall of 2006 quoting lines from Borat about ""making sexytime"" then found themselves laughing hollowly through the singing-penis scene in Bruno may decide theyre through with the boundary-ignoring British comedian after this half political farce half romantic comedy. For one thing the stunt aspect of those first two films is absent for the first time. The Dictator is a fully scripted comedy (the screenplay is by Baron Cohen Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer) with none of its stars signature ambushes of unsuspecting public figures. This robs the movie of that anarchic anything-could-happen energy that animated the first two features. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The Dictator also represents the moment in which Baron Cohen runs up against the limitations imposed by his own abrasive persona. I think its safe to say that he has no equal as an un-embarrassable guerilla satirist but for that very reason hes an odd fit as a romantic hero. The conventional meet-cute love story at the center of The Dictator (a North African tyrant in hiding falls for a crunchy Brooklyn peace activist) feels like a bizarre concession to some nonexistent demographic that prefers its sick black comedy with a side of humanist sentiment. Isnt the whole point of going to a Sacha Baron Cohen movie to get away from humanist sentiment to go to a place where darker regions can be accessed? In The Dictators early scenes at least some of that darkness is on view as we get a vision of what life is like in the fictional country of Wadiya over which Adm. Gen. Aladeen (Baron Cohen) rules with casually capricious brutality. Aladeen orders a weapons engineers execution because the engineer refuses to make the nuclear missile hes developing sufficiently ""pointy"" and Aladeen wins multiple medals in the Wadiya Olympics by shooting his competitors dead during the race. He substitutes his own name for many important words in the language including both ""positive"" and ""negative"" (leading to some confusion vis-a-vis HIV test results). The obscenely wealthy Aladeen also flies celebrities to his lavish palace for a night of sex (a Polaroid wall of his conquests reveals past visits from Lindsay Lohan Halle Berry and Oprah Winfrey) then begs them in vain to stay for a cuddle. Advertisement The movie veers away from political satire in the middle section as Aladeen travels to New York intending to deliver an Ahmedinajad-style rant at the U.N. Instead the Wadiya resistance kidnaps him and begins training a feebleminded lookalike double (also played by SBC) to read a statement promising democratic reforms. After escaping his captors Aladeen holes up at an organic grocery store in Brooklyn run by hippie bleeding-heart Zoey (Anna Faris.) The two gradually fall in love despite Aladeens near-nonstop awfulness (in addition to being a font of anti-Semitism and racial hate speech he kicks one customers loudmouthed son and delivers a couples baby on the stores floor only to tell the parents ""Bad news. Its a girl. Wheres the trash can?"") ""Its a girl. Wheres the trash can?"" did elicit a hoot of shocked laughter though the critique of sexism implicit in that line is undercut by the carefree misogyny of many other scenes in which Aladeen mocks the unglamorous (but adorable) Zoey for being a ""lesbian hobbit"" who should shave her underarms and lose five pounds. Most of The Dictator had me neither laughing nor shocked but just staring at the screen in anxious is-that-all-there-is? silence. The movie has a deadening sluggishness at its center a sense of exhausted shtick on Baron Cohens part and missed opportunities for the supporting cast. Anna Faris Ben Kingsley and John C. Reilly all gifted comic actors do little more than drift in and out to set up punch lines. (As Aladeens always-about-to-be-executed right-hand man Nadal Jason Mantzoukas does get off a few agreeably deadpan jokes.) Though each of his movies so far has shown diminishing returns Baron Cohen hasnt lost me entirely; in fact Im eager to see where his career goes next. As a performer hes a transfixing enigma with a monklike commitment to the repellent characters he creates (his resistance to appearing in public as himself runs deeper than just showbiz pranksterism I think) and a near-superhuman tolerance for social opprobrium. Hes also an agile physical comedian as he showed in a Peter Sellers-like bumbling-cop role in Hugo and can even put over a Sondheim song as he demonstrated in Sweeney Todd. At their best Baron Cohens puerile provocations can tap into deep wells of desire envy and shame--the audience laughs because he does things so awful wed never dare to try them. Now if he would just try doing something hes never done before. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Clinton Takes the Lead in First Post-DNC Poll 2.

Why? Because you give me your confidence? No. Because I give you mine."" Sacha Baron Cohen who has for most of his career been as much con artist as comic knows this well. For all their linguistic and ideological variety the characters he inhabited on the big and little screens--Ali G Borat Bruno--shared an exquisite credulity. All three got their marks to believe them by being utterly open to belief themselves.It wasnt merely his victims who were being conned though. In his two big feature films Borat and Bruno Baron Cohen laid the high low and the low lower--but consistently in that sequence. He would win the audience over at the outset by afflicting the comfortable be they feminists fashionistas or famous folk. But by the end he was heaping ridicule on rubes or racists the real suckers not people like you or me or Sacha Baron Cohen. Funny as these bits sometimes were there was a mean-spiritedness to them an undercurrent of social superiority. Whether because he feared we mugs were getting wise or he felt he had nobody left to con Baron Cohen has dropped the mockumentary form for his new movie The Dictator opting for a straightforward scripted comedy. And while the film lacks the delirious daring of its predecessors the sense of possibility and peril it leaves a less unpleasant aftertaste.This time out Baron Cohen keeps his savage wit trained on people with whom (one presumes) he has no genuine beef you know people who are opposed to dictatorship and summary execution and rape. Baron Cohens character Admiral General Aladeen is of course a strong proponent of all three. As the movie opens Aladeen a Gaddafiesque caricature who rules the fictional North African nation of Wadiya keeps involuntarily cracking up as he announces to the world that his efforts to enrich weapons-grade uranium will only be used for ""peaceful purposes."" MORE ON MOVIES The Deathly Dullness of Dark Shadows Our Picks for Which Film to See Each Week of Summer The Astonishing Avengers How to Fix the Action Movie The world is less than amused so soon enough Aladeen has to leave the comforts of home--executing subordinates playing a Wii game based on the Munich Olympics--to appear at the United Nations and make clear his intentions. (""Ah America"" he muses ""built by the blacks and owned by the Chinese."") Alas once he is in New York Aladeens scheming uncle (Ben Kingsley) has him replaced by an easy-to-control double while hes carted off to be tortured and killed. Aladeen is singularly unimpressed with the tools and techniques of his torturer--""An anal umbrella? Wheres the splash guard? Youre going to murder me and your white shirt""--and he does in fact escape though not before being shorn of his opulent beard. Friendless beardless and unrecognizable he wanders the streets of New York until he meets his polar-opposite love (or at least lust) interest the lefty-crunchy proprietor of a grocery called the Free Earth Collective (Anna Faris almost unrecognizable in a brunette pixie cut).Theres more than a whiff of Coming to America to the proceedings though The Dictator is vastly more eager to offend. As a character Aladeen is rather a disappointment coming from an actor of Baron Cohens parodic range essentially Borat with an entitlement complex. Nor are the other principals given much to do though Faris characteristically makes the most of her opportunities. The movie itself directed by Baron Cohens usual collaborator Larry Charles is a bit scattershot and schticky never quite settling into a consistent comic rhythm.Yet for fans of Baron Cohens work there are plenty of moments of crass hilarity. As ever he is willing to go anywhere for a joke with the better part of an entire scene taking place inside an area of intimate anatomy. There are some cunning lines about Aladeens fellow global villains Kim Jong Il (to whom the film is dedicated ""in loving memory"") Ahmadinejad bin Laden and yes Cheney. The soundtrack is rather witty featuring variations on ""Everybody Hurts"" ""9 to 5"" and ""Lets Get It On."" And a number of stars--including Megan Fox John C. Reilly Garry Shandling and Edward Norton--make sharp cameos many on the theme that any celebrity will sleep with you if you pay them enough.Arguably best of all no civilians were harmed during the making of this film.

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

A team of University of Pennsylvania scientists is using Facebook status updates to find commonalities in the words used by different ages genders and even psyches. The so-called ""World Well-Being Project"" started as an effort to gauge happiness across various states and communities. ""Governments have an increased interest in measuring not just economic outcomes but other aspects of well-being"" said Andrew Schwartz a UPenn computer scientist who works on the project.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

My hands hover over the computer keyboard. They are trembling. I hold down the shift key and type the words with intention saying each letter aloud ""R-e-a-c-t-i-v-e A-t-t-a-c-h-m-e-n-t D-i-s-o-r-d-e-r."" The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue. Continue Reading Phillip Cheung / Quanta Magazine The Debate Over Times Place in the Universe Dan Falk Physicists cant agree on whether the flow of future to past is real or a mental construct. Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

The Dictator Bad to fair Director Larry Charles. Cast Sacha Baron Cohen Ben Kingsley Anna Faris. Rating R for crude and sexual content brief male nudity language and violence. Another thing that separates it from those two movies Its not that funny. OK maybe thats a little harsh. There are some clever bits scattered here and there including a visual gag about the worst possible place you could misplace a cellphone. But for the most part the movies rhythms feel slightly off -- there are long stretches without a laugh -- and there is a mean-spirited air to the whole thing. Baron Cohen portrays Gen. Aladeen the leader of the fictional oil-rich nation of Wadiya in North Africa. Aladeen was born into power; as a baby he sported the long Khomeini-style beard he wears as an adult. Not exactly a knee-slapper. Aladeen is ruthless the kind of dictator who orders people killed for the slightest offenses. In one of the films funnier bits all those condemned by Aladeen wind up migrating to the States. Aladeen comes to the States too to make a speech at the United Nations. But he is double-crossed by right-hand man Tahir (Ben Kingsley) who has hired a double to impersonate Aladeen and turn the country into a democracy. The real Aladeen winds up stripped of his beard and roaming the streets until he meets up with liberal Zoey (Anna Faris) a Mother Earth News type who works at an organic grocery co-op. The plot is overly complex when you can tell it exists merely as a device for Aladeen to loosen up and let love into his heart. For all its grossness the movie essentially has a mushy center. Its more ""Coming to America"" than ""Borat."" In the films final moments Aladeen extolls the joys of dictatorship which winds up sounding suspiciously like our Western brand of government. It is broad and obvious and like much of the movies bits you can see it coming from a mile away. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Say it isnt so. Is Sacha Baron Cohen a.k.a. Ali G Borat and Bruno actually starring in a movie with a semi-coherent plot? Seems like it. Theres not a mock-doc improvised caught-on-the-fly ""gotcha"" moment in all of The Dictator. Baron Cohen wrote the linear script with Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer. And Larry Charles who directed Borat and Bruno stages every scene with emotional maturity and military precision. Hell Im lying. The Dictator zigs and zags through its scant 84 minutes as if running wild to save its crazy ass. Oddly enough this is a good thing. Even with a blueprint to follow the Cambridge-educated Baron Cohen is always best when he jumps the fences of comedy. Thats why The Dictator leaves you laughing helplessly. It starts at outrageous and rockets on from there. Screw the occasional sputter. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Baron Cohen plays General Admiral Haffaz Aladeen dictator of the fictional North African country of Wadiya with a beard as bogus as his accent. The Supreme Leader lives to oppress launching a reign of a terror from his palace - that is when he isnt boffing visiting Hollywood royalty (Megan Fox cameos hilariously as herself). On a trip to New York Aladeen takes crap from a hotel manager (a terrific John C. Reilly) who mistakes him for an Arab. ""Youre all Arabs to me"" says the manager ""the blacks the Jews those blue tree-hugging queers in Avatar."" In short time Aladeens second-in-command Tamir (Ben Kingsley barely suppressing a giggle) has shaved his rulers beard and stripped him of power. Eddie Murphy covered similar ground in 1988s Coming to America but Baron Cohen doesnt play it nearly as gentle. Forced to live in disguise as a commoner on the mean streets of Manhattan Aladeen resents being gamed out of his throne by Tamir and Efawadh (Baron Cohen again) an idiot body double. He plots revenge with the help of Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas is a hoot) a nuclear expert he thought he had executed back home. Sexual arousal comes in the hairy armpits of Zoey (Anna Faris) a left-wing Brooklyn zealot preaching organic veggies and ""death to Aladeen"" (not knowing hes the man shes falling for). ""I love it when women go to school"" says Aladeen. ""Its like seeing a monkey on roller skates - it means nothing to them but its so adorable for us."" The better gags including Zoey schooling her new squeeze in the how-to of jerking off and Aladeen panicking American tourists during a chopper ride over Manhattan lead up to a stingingly funny climax in which Aladeen gives his big speech about dictatorship. The fearless satirist in Baron Cohen is alive and well in this killer sequence which dodges soothing convention and ultimately merits comparisons to The Marx Brothers Duck Soup and Charlie Chaplins The Great Dictator. ""You dont know how good you have it here"" says Aladeen to the heart of democracy. In his country he claims the top one-percent controls all the wealth and a dictator can declare war with impunity even on the wrong country. Talk about laughs that stick in the throat.

Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Melinda Sue Gordon/Paramount Pictures The Dictator Director Larry Charles Genre Comedy Running Time 82 minutes Rated R for strong crude and sexual content brief male nudity language and some violent images With Sacha Baron Cohen Anna Faris Ben Kingsley Jason Mantzoukas Many fans will be disappointed that Sacha Baron Cohens The Dictator is a more or less conventional comedy and not an ambush-interview mockumentary in the style of Borat and Bruno. But that guerrilla-clown shtick would be tough to sustain Why not let him try something else? The good news is that The Dictator is loose and slap-happy and full of sharp political barbs and has funny actors moving in and out -- and at a lickety-split 83 minutes it doesnt wear out its welcome. Baron Cohen plays Haffaz Aladeen the authoritarian ruler of the fictional African nation of Wadiya a cross between Gadhafi and Kim Jong Il. This raging egomaniac with his ridiculous fur-ball beard orders his surname to be used in place of such common words as ""Yes"" and ""No"" which means you cant tell what anyone means when they answer ""Aladeen"" -- and if you complain about that or anything else hell have his guards haul you off to be beheaded. Aladeen controls a vast oil supply and is building nuclear warheads which he tells the world will be used for ""peaceful purposes"" -- but has the giggles before getting the words out. He hates Israel. For fun he watches tapes of the 72 Munich Olympics massacre.

May 7 2012 Baron Cohen loves portraying anti-Semites as imbeciles. The title links the film to Chaplins Hitler satire The Great Dictator. But my guess is that theres also a process at work here that psychiatrists call identifying with the aggressor You assume the role of people that you fear. Baron Cohens identification with Aladeen is so strong that you end up rooting -- yes rooting -- for the dictator because this idiot is more likable than his chief aide Tamir played by a dour Ben Kingsley. Tamir arranges to have Aladeen murdered en route to a U.N. speech and make Wadiya a democracy not because he gives a hoot about the people but because it would open up the country to U.S. oil companies and make him insanely wealthy. The kidnapped Aladeen proves wonderfully resourceful. He gets the upper hand on his torturer by shaming the man for his outdated instruments and reminding him that without a splash guard hell wreck his suit with all the blood. After escaping the now-beardless dictator takes refuge in a collectively run Manhattan health-food store overseen by Zoey a human-rights activist played by the utterly delightful Anna Faris. The Dictator is the kind of anti-fascist movie that has you cheering when Aladeen takes a job in that lefty store and wins over its staff by using brutal authoritarian techniques on the city health inspector. He and Zoey are an unlikely couple but when she says ""The police here are such racists"" and he says ""Yeah and not in a good way"" they have a real rapport. The Dictator doesnt approach the greatest of all American anti-war farces the Marx Brothers Duck Soup but Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles are certainly in the arena. In a climactic speech Aladeen extols the benefits of a dictatorship over a democracy which gives leaders he says power to declare war unilaterally violate civil liberties and structure the economy so the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. The speech is a triumph of the satirists art. I wish we had more American movies like this -- entertainments that mix low farce and high political satire reminding us that extreme silliness does not preclude extreme seriousness.

Sacha Baron Cohen manages to make a brutal North African dictator painfully funny.  |  out of 4 stars Star Tribune May 15 2012 -- 232pm Video (4023)  The latest Sacha Baron Cohen is like the others -- expect to be offended and expect to laugh during at least one scene. Shari L. Gross Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Dictator"" is fearlessly juvenile and strikingly smart though not always at the same time. Sacha Baron Cohens third starring feature and the first to be fully scripted is sharp as a scimitar in one scene and wobbly in the next but its unfailingly audacious. Youve heard of take-no-prisoners satire? This is mockery that rounds up the prisoners and executes them. Its hard to think of another comedian who would construct a running gag around the various uses one can find for a decapitated head. Or film a sequence from the interior of a uterus. Not since ""The Human Centipede"" have I felt so worked over but this time I liked it. Its so wrong but it feels so right. As North African dictator Adm. Gen. Aladeen the star plays a hereditary tyrant who has been Wadiyas ""glorious oppressor"" since age 7. He orders executions as casually as you might order takeout pizza and merrily plays a video game about terrorists at the 1972 Munich Olympics. On a trip to New York City where he intends to harangue the United Nations hes kidnapped shorn of his voluminous beard and cast onto the streets as a bum. Hes taken in by Zoe (Anna Faris) the ultra-PC manager of an organic grocery store who sees his strutting confrontational hubris as merely a collection of teachable moments. Director Larry Charles who also helmed ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" understands that the best way to make an unsympathetic character likable is to give him romantic problems. Aladeens relationships with women have been kind of sketchy ever since his dads henchmen smothered his mom in the delivery room. His vast wealth has allowed him to rack up a string of celebrity conquests (Megan Fox pops up in a self-mocking cameo) but hes never had the love of a good woman. Zoe is none too glamorous (Farris downplays her looks with a short brunette hairdo assertive underarm hair and shapeless attire). Aladeen calls her a ""Yeti."" But hey opposites attract. And it turns out that when youre running a hippie-dippy food co-op a little bit of fascism might be just the thing youve been needing. Baron Cohen plays a dual role as the vainglorious Aladeen and his imbecile body double and he makes each one funny in distinctly different ways. Jason Mantzoukas plays a helpful countryman swept into the plot to return Aladeen to power. The pair riff brightly together on the deeper meaning of wearing Crocs and share a brilliant scene in which they scare tourists on a Manhattan helicopter tour with a ""Wadiyan"" conversation that sounds a lot like a terrorist countdown. The film is well-paced with most of the slack at the beginning and the big gags near the finish. Baron Cohens shining moment comes when he delivers a speech denouncing the excesses of despotism in terms that sound a lot like the recent history of a certain global superpower. It hits uncomfortably close to home but where theres no pain theres no comedy. ""The Dictator"" packs plenty of both.

"The Dictator stages a coup of absurdity |       NJ.com comments The Dictator stages a coup of absurdity Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on May 16 2012 at 800 AM updated May 16 2012 at 205 PM View/Post Comments Melinda Sue GordonSacha Baron Cohen is ""The Dictator."" How far is too far? Sacha Baron Cohen is still gleefully trying to figure that one out film by film. In ""Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" he happily lampooned an entire country. In ""Bruno"" he took on gay fashionistas creating an absurdly effete sex-crazed TV personality. And now in ""The Dictator"" he moves on to terrorism torture intolerance weapons of mass destruction celebrity whoredom -- literally -- and politically correct boho Brooklyn. Clearly the man has no fear. In ""The Dictator"" though he finally goes outside his own discomfort zone. Both ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" depended on dropping a preposterous character in the middle of real Americans and filming their reactions. The movies had a slight look-at-the-rubes smirk. ""The Dictator"" marks a change. Actually two. Because for once Baron Cohen has a real script and a supporting cast as skilled at improv as he is. And those complementary elements make a difference. As in his first two films ""The Dictator"" takes a foreigner -- this time General Admiral Haffaz Aladeen despot of the North African country Wadiya -- and drops him in the midst of unfamiliar America. Except that once he gets here he finds out its part of an elaborate scheme to overthrow him and sell out his nation to the multinational oil companies hes always kept at bay. And so he must fight to regain power. The script gives him some unlikely or simply unwitting allies. Anna Faris is charming as a p.c. bohemian who mistakes Aladeen for a political refugee. And Jason Mantzoukas -- as Aladeens disgraced nuclear-weapons honcho -- gets a real rhythm going in their scenes together. The addition of a plot a romantic element and genuine actors help make this the most polished and potentially likable of the Baron Cohen comedies (all made with director Larry Charles). Of course not every fan will see accessibility as a plus. Unfortunately the movie cant resist pushing its political incorrectness too far -- or sometimes embracing political correctness too much. The filmmakers for example linger on some particularly gross gags (and a rather sexist fondness for making fun of Faris looks). And while some bad-taste punchlines (one including a severed head) are hilarious mere irony cant excuse jokes about rape and child abuse. Yes the lines are supposedly mocking Aladeens brutality. But they give real brutes cover to laugh with him. Yet theres also a glibly radical (and far worse obvious) speech near the end in which the ruler talks about Americas own dictatorship of ""the 1 percent"" which rigs elections starts phony wars and suppresses dissent. Iran China America -- whats the real difference he asks? I think theres a filmmaker or two out there whod be able to tell him. That is if they werent under house arrest. So its best perhaps if you dont think too rigorously about the politics of ""The Dictator."" (Certainly its filmmakers didnt.) And instead just concentrate on the outrageousness of its humor the interplay of its supporting cast and the obvious joy its star has in once again simply being someone else. Ratings note The film contains nudity sexual situations strong language and violence. The Dictator (R) Paramount (83 min.) Directed by Larry Charles. With Sacha Baron Cohen Anna Faris Jason Mantzoukas. Now playing in New Jersey.

Slideshow The Dictator premiere Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about The Dictator >> ""You could let 1 percent of the people have all the nations wealth. You could help your rich friends get richer by cutting their taxes and bailing them out when they gamble and lose. You could ignore the needs of the poor for health care and education. Your media would appear free but would secretly be controlled by one person and his family. ..."" And the General Admiral -- played with a winning mix of straight-faced ardor and buffoonish pomposity by the British comic star Sacha Baron Cohen -- goes on and on drawing a stark contrast between a dictatorship and a democracy. Not Aladeens speech is an inspired piece of political satire and it is the high-water mark of The Dictator Baron Cohens latest total-immersion alter-ego farce. The man who brought us Borat and Bruno takes us behind the palace walls of Wadiya an oil-rich state with a leader who absolutely denies he is using that enriched uranium for weapons and who orders up executions the way other folks might order a pizza. Disagree with Aladeen and youre outta here. Directed by Baron Cohens longtime collaborator Larry Charles The Dictator mixes its high and low comedy with surprising success. If Aladeens despotic litany represents the movie at its sharpest then a birthing scene may provide the movies biggest are-they-really-doing-this? moment A woman goes into labor in the aisles of a health-food market and Aladeen and his improbable gal pal (Anna Faris) assist the delivery and hold hands in a point-of-view shot that only an obstetrician could love. Then again theres plenty of gross-out toilet humor too and a scene when a Wadiyan goat herder brought in to double for Aladeen (a decoy to thwart an assassination plot) is entertained by a bevy of the dictators Virgin Guards. Accustomed to his goats hes not sure how to go about interacting with these statuesque women but he improvises using a champagne bucket for a milk pail. Throughout The Dictator (dedicated it should be noted ""in loving memory"" of Kim Jong Il) Baron Cohen stays happily in character even as the General Admiral heads for the Big Apple -- to address the United Nations -- and falls into a romance with Faris militantly vegan Brooklynite a woman he describes as a ""lesbian hobbit"" and whose hairy armpits he first finds appalling. Quite the contrast to Megan Fox one of the head of states celebrity courtesans whom Aladeen pays handsomely for spending a few hours in his bed. Halle Berry Katie Perry and Arnold Schwarzenegger are among the others or so the candid photographs adorning a bedroom wall would suggest. Im not sure how The Dictator will hold up on repeated viewings. Like a lot of people I laughed long and hard the first time through Borat and Bruno only to feel let down and maybe even a little bored by the raunchy audacity ethnic caricaturing and knuckleheaded sight gags the second time around. But if someone manages to defy those night-vision-equipped piracy police and put Cohens dictatorship-vs.-democracy oration up on YouTube it could resonate all through the months leading up to the presidential election.

Photo (c)Paramount/Courtesy Everett Coll Sacha Baron Cohen tackles a more or less conventionally scripted fish-out-of-water/political satire/romantic comedy/raunchfest in the fitfully amusing ""The Dictator. It ends up being a lot less hilarious than ""Borat and not quite as funny as ""Bruno. While Baron Cohens obviously become too well-known to fool civilians with his gonzo comedy as he did in the earlier mock documentaries his acting chops still arent the greatest -- though hes improved from his embarrassingly bad performance in ""Hugo. If Osama bin Laden were still alive -- and hes lewdly name-checked repeatedly here -- even he would be aware that in this heavily promoted comedy Baron Cohen plays Admiral General Aladeen who has ruled the oil-rich and fictitious North African nation of Wadiya with a heavy hand after ascending to the throne at age 7. Combining the least endearing traits of Saddam Hussein Moammar Khadafy and Kim Jong-il (the film is dedicated to the latter) with a bin Laden-like beard Aladeen is a megalomaniac who shoots opponents to win his own version of the Olympics. The funniest scene in what amounts to a shaky mash-up of Charlie Chaplins ""The Great Dictator and Eddie Murphys ""Coming to America comes early on when Megan Fox cameos as the latest of the chronically unloved Aladeens (paid) celebrity trysts. He posts a Polaroid of her on a wall that includes pictures of Oprah Winfrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger among many many others. Aladeens uncle and chief aide Tamir (a wisely underplaying Ben Kingsley) Wadiya s rightful heir is plotting to replace his nephew with an idiot shepherd whos been recruited as Aladeens body-double (also played by Baron Cohen) for a trip to the United Nations. But an attempted assassination (at the hands of John C. Reilly one of many pros whom Cohen struggles to keep up with) gets botched leaving Aladeen stranded in New York City without his trademark beard unbeknownst to Uncle Tamir. Aladeen finds an improbable protector and soulmate in Zoey (an unrecognizable and miscast brunette Anna Faris) the feminist vegetarian manager of a health food store in Brooklyn where our hero goes to work despite his frequent rants about Zoeys hairy armpits and the joys of totalitarianism. The dictator encounters his former nuclear-weapons expert (Jason Mantzoukas) and the two begin plotting a way to prevent Tamir from having Aladeens double sign a new constitution that would introduce democracy and turn over Wadiyas oilfields to a Chinese businessman. As directed by Larry Charles the results are far more scattershot than his and Baron Cohens previous collaborations especially their masterpiece ""Borat. Theres a very funny scene where a couple of tourists mistake some innocent remarks during a helicopter ride for a planned terrorist attack. Having Aladeen deliver a baby in the aisle of the health food store reeks of desperation in a movie that contains far too many stale gay-panic gags. Aladeens final speech at a press conference -- suggesting there isnt much difference between his dictatorship and the United States -- feels like a satirical afterthought added at the last minute to pad out the abbreviated running time. At one point in ""The Dictator Aladeen boasts of his acting prowess which he says has allowed him to dominate Wadiyas version of the Golden Globes. As for Baron Cohen hes a great comic but his acting can still use work -- most of his funniest lines appear to have been dubbed over other actors reaction shots in post-production.

This question stupid as it may appear on the surface has intrigued me ever since ""Da Ali G Show"" began airing in the United States. Its a stupid question because Baron Cohen is a comedian; as ""edgy"" or ""controversial"" as his topics and material may sometimes be his job is to make people laugh. But most comedians dont try to get laughs by interviewing Pat Buchanan or Boutros Boutros-Ghali (""Boutros Boutros Boutros-Ghali"" as Ali G introduced him) under false pretenses or by leading a group of unsuspecting Arizona nightclubbers in a rousing chorus of ""Throw the Jew Down the Well.""Its an ancient truism of comedy that what makes us most uncomfortable and shocks us the most is also where the deepest veins of humor reside and throughout his career Baron Cohen has specialized in prodding those sore spots sometimes with an evident political point of view and sometimes totally not. In a throwaway moment early in Baron Cohens new movie ""The Dictator"" (directed by Baron Cohens frequent collaborator Larry Charles who was also at the helm for ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"") we see the bearded North African tyrant Admiral General Aladeen portrayed of course by Baron Cohen playing a first-person-shooter video game called ""Munich Olympics."" Youre groaning already right? Heres how it works You knock on the door marked ""Israeli Olympic Team."" When a cute little Smurf-like creature in a yarmulke and side-curls answers the door -- ""Shalom"" -- a pop-up widget announces ""Shoot the Jew"" and you waste him. It continues from there ""Oy vey"" ""Mazeltov"" ""Meshugenah"" cry the cheerfully dying figures.This is funny precisely because its not funny and if that sounds too mystical or dialectical for you lets remember that were talking about a guy who has cited World War II-era historian Ian Kershaw who was one of his professors at Cambridge as a major influence. ""I know its not very funny being a comedian talking about the Holocaust"" Baron Cohen once told Rolling Stone interviewer Neil Strauss while making it clear that in exposing the casual cruelty and docile conformity of the ordinary people with whom he interacted he was doing exactly that. You can argue theres a personal agenda at work here since Baron Cohen grew up in a prominent British Jewish family and is the grandson of a Holocaust survivor (in his words the last Jewish girl trained as a ballerina in Nazi Germany). But I see something more than that a dark and even misanthropic moral and intellectual vision that conceals somewhere way deep down the smothered hope for a better world.We laugh at the ""Munich Olympics"" video game (if indeed we do laugh) because were appalled and we see some truth in it. Were appalled that Baron Cohen and his co-writers were malicious enough to come up with it were appalled with ourselves for so readily accepting it as humor and were appalled by the incontrovertible fact that some people -- in places like Aladeens fictional homeland the Republic of Wadiya but also in Britain and the U.S. and anywhere else you care to mention -- would take smirking delight in such a game if it existed. (Which for all I know it may.)""The Dictator"" is a much more normal kind of movie than ""Borat"" or ""Bruno"" perhaps because Baron Cohen is now too famous -- and has been threatened too many times with lawsuits and/or beatdowns -- to pull off his in-character performance provocations. (Frankly hadnt the shtick worn out by the time of the very mixed ""Bruno"" anyway?) Despite some cleverly snipped bits of real news footage from the Libyan crisis ""The Dictator"" is a scripted entertainment from start to finish with Baron Cohen playing both the vainglorious and idiotic Wadiyan autocrat and also the even dumber rural goatherd selected to serve as his assassination-thwarting double. On a trip to New York to address the United Nations the real Aladeen gets separated from his entourage thanks to an incompetent CIA blowhard played by John C. Reilly. Shorn of his beard and of his access to voluptuous hookers and anti-Semitic video games the erstwhile dictator is forced to work in a feminist food collective in Brooklyn where he falls hard for Anna Faris as its unshaven-armpit pixie-cut sporting ultra-p.c. manager. (Aladeen repeatedly remarks that she has the physique of a preteen boy -- and specifically of Harry Potter -- but its not clear whether thats a bad thing.) You Might Also Like Although the character of Aladeen seems awfully predictable by Baron Cohen standards the movie itself veers from one hilarious absurd and patently offensive setup to the next mercilessly mocking the stupidity and paranoia of Americans the venality of celebrities -- theres a joke about Katy Perrys purported relations with Aladeen that I cant even euphemize successfully -- the Chinese lust for world domination and the cultural vapidity and backwardness of the Arab world. There are moments of unabated vulgar silliness as when a rich woman gazing out the window of a Manhattan luxury hotel gets an unexpected faceful of wobbly Aladeen dong. And there are even moments when Baron Cohens portrayal of the benighted dictator -- who is perhaps more ignorant and miseducated than innately evil -- borders on sweetness if you can really use that word to describe a film that involves jokes about rape torture abortion and fellatio performed with a geriatric drug dealers severed head.But lets revert to my original WTF question about Baron Cohen by way of this films obvious relationship to Charlie Chaplins 1940 ""The Great Dictator"" which is also about a demented world leader with genocidal fantasies and the ordinary citizen (in Chaplins film a Jewish barber) who becomes his accidental replacement. On one level of course the comparison is ridiculous. Chaplins film is a masterpiece or something close to it -- prescient daring and almost unbearably tragic an optimistic and sentimental plea for reason in a world teetering on the edge of the abyss. Remember that when that film was released the U.S. and Germany were not yet at war and the worst atrocities of the Holocaust had not yet happened although the film seems to see them coming. I cant resist feeling that ""The Dictator"" (whose screenplay is credited to Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer along with Baron Cohen) restages Chaplins great farce in a darker and more vulgar register to reflect a world that has been fundamentally poisoned not just by Hitlers crimes but by decades of subsequent mendacity and hypocrisy. I shouldnt spoil Aladeens climactic speech in which he praises the many virtues of dictatorship (which the Western world has so foolishly left behind) except to say that its a brilliant sardonic response to the paean to progress and democracy delivered by Chaplins barber in the guise of the dictator Hynkel -- and that its targets are you and me not the known tyrants and despots of the Arab world. ""We are coming into a new world a kindlier world where men will rise above their hate their greed and brutality"" Chaplins character tells the world. There are good reasons to suspect that Baron Cohen who spent his teen years active in the Zionist-socialist youth organization Habonim Dror (which advocates peace between Israel and its neighbors) is a lefty somewhere deep down. But the new world without hate greed and brutality -- nuh-uh hes heard that one before. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

In recent months the cartoon despot who rules over the imaginary state of Wadiya in The Dictator has crashed the Oscars kidnapped Martin Scorsese on SNL and sat for an interview with Larry King. His Excellencys public relations campaign leading up to the movies release has been a coup a testament to a unique talent for character improv from the British comedian who created idiot British rapper Ali G idiot Kazakh journalist Borat and idiot Austrian fashion queen Bruno. The movie itself though is a failed insurrection. Tethered to a script that in a dismaying tonal turn for the mushier requires the idiot North African oppressor to learn and love by storys end Baron Cohens demonstrations of political ""outrageousness"" feel all too canned planned and defanged. So yes the script (by a huddle of guys including the star) is a problem. After some forced convolutions Aladeen winds up working as an employee in a stereotypical Brooklyn-hipster quinoa emporium where he reports to Anna Faris stereotypical vegan-type feminist chick with proud tufts of armpit hair. But the casting of well-known professional actors (including the likable Faris) also saps Baron Cohens strengths; he does much better playing off unsuspecting real people in documentary-style settings. Sir Ben Kingsley in particular flounders as a scheming member of his cabinet unable to find the right balance between menace and straight-faced lunacy. Director Larry Charles meanwhile brings the same slapdash style to The Dictator that he did to Borat and Bruno always happy to linger longer than necessary on the gross the insulting and the politically or sexually ""shocking."" Whats shocking this time is how tame Sacha Baron Cohens newest wild man is for all the kerfuffle the comedian can stir up on the promotional trail. C?

But thats surely the intent of provocateur Sacha Baron Cohen creator of such gleefully offensive characters as Borat and Bruno.VIDEO Watch a clip from The DictatorMORE Dictator teases Matt Lauer about Ann Curry Ryan SeacrestThe Dictator is more scripted but no less outlandish Cohen. The scripting helps The film has a better developed plot than Bruno (2009) and a more defined structure than Borat (2006). And while tastelessness is rampant and the humor uneven The Dictator also has its moments of slyly clever satire.Cohen plays Adm. Gen. Aladeen the ""supreme leader"" of Wadiya a fictitious oil-rich North African nation. Hes racist misogynist and hellbent on developing pointy nuclear weapons. Hes a particularly petty uber-dictator changing the national language so that his name Aladeen connotes a variety of meanings. The denizens are not only oppressed but also living in linguistic confusion.Aladeen is obviously a play on the name Aladdin and theres a scene in which he rides into New York City on a camel surrounded by an elaborate retinue a la Disneys Aladdin. Most of the action takes place in Manhattan as Aladeen struggles to regain his dictatorship even as his duplicitous adviser Tamir (Ben Kingsley) has found a knuckleheaded Aladeen double to sign a U.N. agreement turning Wadiya into a democracy.About the movieThe Dictator1/2 out of fourStars Sacha Baron Cohen Anna Faris Ben Kingsley Director Larry CharlesDistributor Paramount PicturesRating R for strong crude and sexual content brief male nudity language and some violent images Running time 1 hour 23 minutes Opens Wednesday nationwideAladeen joins forces with Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) a former Wadiyan bomb builder to restore the dictator to his ruling place. Their plan entails Aladeen working for the sweetly oblivious vegan entrepreneur Zooey (Anna Faris) who is catering an event in the U.N. building.The Dictator addresses the media at the Waldorf-Astoria in NYC.Despite initially insulting her with a bevy of tasteless remarks Aladeen falls for Zooey. Turns out the barbarous Aladeen is a lonely guy just seeking some cuddles. A nasty/loopy fish-out-of-water tale turns into a rom-com with a mean streak then goes back to politically inspired wicked laughs. Who else but Cohen could mine humor from human rights abuses and 9/11?With a beard that hangs 10 inches off his face Aladeen sees himself as a ""great dictator"" in the tradition of Kim Jong Il (to whom the movie is lovingly dedicated) Moammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein. But lately he says he has been playing bridge with Rick Santorum ""I like him despite his liberal views.""Cohens wry observations of contemporary politics have a surprisingly sharp bite standing out in the half-baked overall premise.When he addresses a gathering at a climactic moment (reminiscent of Charlie Chaplins third-act speech in the 1940 classic The Great Dictator) his political commentary is more pointed than the nuclear warheads he favored""Imagine a country where 1% of the people controlled most of the wealth"" and leaders wage war against the wrong country for trumped-up reasons he tells the crowd. ""I know that this must be hard for you Americans to understand.""Cohen is the bawdiest of political satirists with his in-your-face comic style. While some jokes in The Dictator fall flat and others merely serve to shock a choice few definitely hit the mark. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

"Movie review The Dictator rules with crudeness and smarts - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Sacha Baron CohenMovie review The Dictator rules with crudeness and smartsThe Dictator review The genius and folly Sacha Baron Cohen displayed in Borat are on display as are the talents of Anna Faris.May 16 2012|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Sacha Baron Cohen portrays Admiral General Aladeen in a scene from ""The... (Melinda Sue Gordon Paramount...)Like its creator and star Sacha Baron Cohen the comedy of ""The Dictator"" is mercurial to the extreme and as crude as the massive oil reserves of Wadiya the fictional North African nation where his latest movie prank begins. By turns hysterical heretical guilty innocent silly sophisticated teasing and tedious the film follows the power-mad leader Admiral General Haffaz Aladeen as he loses his bearings his beard and his heart in New York City.""The Dictator"" underscores both Baron Cohens genius and his folly and delivers the actors signature blend of scatological outrage sagacity and at least one full-frontal assault with a flaccid unmentionable. Like the girl with the curl when he is good he is very very good and when he is bad he is horrid.Working to whip up the mayhem this time the real people Baron Cohen usually toys with have been replaced by a fine cast of real actors. Anchored by Anna Faris Ben Kingsley and Jason Mantzoukas these folks know how to be comic foils whether working from the script by Baron Cohen Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer or improvising under the direction of Larry Charles (""Curb Your Enthusiasm""). It is the same core filmmaking collective that collaborated with Baron Cohen on his first film the very fresh ""Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan"" in 2006 followed by the overly ripe fetish of""Bruno"" in 2009. ""The Dictator"" falls somewhere in between though closer to ""Borat"" in originality and tone.The farce starts with snapshots of the generals life a winning fixed athletic contests bedding famous females and most significantly stockpiling nuclear weapons that he worries arent ""pointy"" enough while the United Nations worries where they might actually be pointing.A trip to the U.S. Baron Cohens favorite staging ground for ridicule is of course required. There the unraveling of a dictatorship begins with his scheming Uncle Tamir (Kingsley) plotting a coup NYC health food hippie Zoey (Faris) planning an anti-Aladeen protest and Aladeen himself just wanting to ride his camels down Fifth Avenue. In strange unpredictable and exceedingly politically incorrect ways it all comes to pass.Baron Cohen and crew count heavily on the fish-out-of-water conceit to make the movie work and so Aladeen is soon beardless penniless and braving the streets of New York City on his own. A confused not-exactly-deposed dictator making a mess of most of his encounters allows Baron Cohens physical comedy a those gangly limbs that flat-footed walk that blank stare a to take center stage.The good-hearted Zoey soon rescues him and unintentionally begins his re-education. Meanwhile Tamir is working on some black-market oil deals to enrich himself while the illiterate Aladeen look-alike hes found to stand in for the dictator (also played by Baron Cohen) spends time grooming his goat instead of practicing the U.N. speech hes supposed to deliver. A lot more stuff happens including torture and tourism.Coming on the heels of the Arab Spring the satire should feel especially relevant but there is so much silliness its hard to take anything here that seriously. The international news does provide ""The Dictator"" a lot of political hay with Baron Cohen taking as many jabs at ""democratic"" systems of government as dictatorships. Satirizing the political side of things a from all sides a has long been the sweet spot of Baron Cohens comedy. In his previous films particularly ""Borat"" the comic was able to expose and exploit human nature using his unstaged encounters with various upright citizens. (Recall the Southern hospitality that Borat received from some right-wingers?) Adding actors and a script to the equation changes the dynamic a the performances in ""The Dictator"" are more polished but some of the serendipity and surprise is lost in the process.Kingsley and Baron Cohen tap into some of the chemistry that they found playing off of each other in Martin Scorseses""Hugo."" But Faris is the films standout. She is almost unrecognizable as the boyish Zoey a her blond locks shorn pixie short and dyed a mousy brown her makeup almost nonexistent and her armpit hair homegrown. But when she opens her mouth that rasp that has made her so much fun to watch (the ""Scary Movie"" franchise most memorably) takes hold and turns the dialogue inside out. The kind of true-believer purity she brings to Zoeys eco-terrorizing rants comes close to stealing Baron Cohens comic thunder.Thats easier to do when the laughs are tied to Aladeens most basic of bodily functions. Harder to top are the times when Baron Cohens mind is mined a a scene with Aladeen trying to come up with a fake name when he stumbles into a restaurant for disaffected Wadiyan expats is priceless. The movies high point though is at the U.N. where facts simply stated make for searing satire.Still by the end its hard not to think that this particular joke has gone on too long. Perhaps it is time for Baron Cohen to have a go at pushing other acting boundaries harder and give the Borats the Brunos the Aladeens of the world and us a rest.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESBAFTA L.A. to honor Sacha Baron Cohen at Britannia AwardsSeptember 9 2013Sacha Baron Cohen takes landlord role in Hollywood Hills...March 29 2013Sacha Baron Cohen lists Hollywood Hills house at 2.595...February 11 2013Sacha Baron Cohen vs. Hollywood A reason to watch the...February 24 2012Dissecting the Tao of Borat -- did we learn?January 4 2008MORE STORIES ABOUTSacha Baron CohenBoratAnna FarisCultural LearningsCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-the-dictator-20120516,0,6469800.story",200,thedictator17,thedictator,latimes

Under Aladeens rule oil-producing uranium-enriching Wadiya is a hostile threat to global peace and capitalism. And yet Aladeen himself is so attracted to Western culture that he has commanded a parade of American celebrities to have sex with him (Megan Fox plays ""herself"") taking Polaroids afterward as proof. Its not a ""Fuck you America"" power thing (thats a fetish saved for another character one The Dictator codes as unequivocal slime). ""I really want someone to cuddle"" Aladeen confesses then gazes longingly at walls covered in photos of his celebrity conquests. A poor little rich boy with no limits and no one to love hes sort of the Muslim-extremist version of Arthur.He might not even be a murderer Without the self-absorbed leaders awareness everyone Aladeen sentences to death is smuggled to safety by his resistance-minded executioner. Soon Aladeens brother (Ben Kingsley) attempts to sell him out hiring a goat-fetishizing look-alike (also played by Baron Cohen) to serve as Aladeens double as they all travel to New York to defend Wadiyas nuclear program to the U.N. The plan is to have the real Aladeen killed then coach the fake into using the U.N. speech to renounce Aladeens regime and announce Wadiyas impending transformation into a democracy. (Kingsleys character is no human rights champion He needs Aladeen out of the way to exploit Wadiyas oil.) The dictator escapes his scheduled assassination and ends up outside the U.N. in bum garb leading the gathered protesters in a cry against the ""illegitimate"" leader addressing the assembly inside.This draws the attention of Zoe (Anna Faris) a crunchy Brooklyn activist who mistakes Aladeen for a dissident and welcomes him into her refugee-staffed Williamsburg food co-op. While plotting to overthrow the impostor and take back Wadiya Aladeen uses his disciplinary talents to reform Zoes store and falls for her in the process. This subplot activates the films most successful joke Of course a despot who rails against democracy while accumulating gold-plated Hummers and watching Real Housewives would feel at home in a place where ""resistance"" to the American mainstream revolves around the rigid dictates of political correctness and the consumption of luxuries like coconut water. Faris gets most of the films freshest funniest bits Zoes memory of her time in a ""feminist mime workshop"" made me laugh harder than anything Baron Cohen did the whole movie.Ali G and Borat were such genius characters because Baron Cohen immersed himself so totally while thrusting himself out into the real world and into contact with unsuspecting strangers. The Dictator in contrast exists purely in movie world Although there was apparently much improvisation on set theres no interaction with ""real"" people. Baron Cohen reportedly stayed in character between takes on The Dictator but Im not convinced he stays in character during takes. The character doesnt seem to amount to much more than an imprecise inconsistent accent and an unapologetic played-for-laughs proclivity for rape in a film dedicated to the rehearsal of old-hat culture-clash stereotypes that generally fail to unearth anything new about any of the cultures involved. Aladeen is so implausible as a real-world construction that neither character nor actor takes him seriously--in one early scene during a speech about how Wadiya is developing uranium for ""peaceful purposes"" Aladeen gets the giggles. Twice.One of Aladeens accomplices realizes that the Supreme Leader has been transformed by his Brooklyn sojourn when he starts working Yiddish words into conversation but he shouldnt be surprised given that Aladeens comic sensibility is thick with borscht. (""Twenty dollars a day for Wi-Fi??"" he exclaims on checking into his hotel. ""And they call me an international criminal"") Eventually the staleness of Aladeens one-liners starts to seem like the joke in and of itself--thats gotta be the only reason why theres an Eat Pray Love punchline in this movie . . . right?Much of the material that isnt dusty feels strained as if the film is reaching to simulate the anarchic no you didnt moments that Baron Cohens previous verite experiments stumbled into. But even in its manufactured boundary-pushing--a flash of full-frontal Baron Cohen another scene set partially inside a birth canal--The Dictator never really risks anything.As a comic stunt and a political statement the film seems to exist to support its climax in which the ""real"" Aladeen tries to sell America on the perks of a dictatorship but ends up illuminating America itself. (""Your media would appear free but be secretly controlled by one person and his family"" ""You could fill your prisons with one particular racial group"") As a punchline hammering home the films core polemic--basically that ""freedom"" and ""tyranny"" arent black and white or mutually exclusive--its pretty great. But it doesnt justify the film-long setup that precedes it. It suggests what could have been had Baron Cohen and Charles played the material a little straight and given the movies world stronger ties to our real world. Great satire after all is funny because its true.

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Dictator Comedy. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen and Anna Faris. Directed by Larry Charles. (R. 83 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""The Dictator"" is only 83 minutes long and thank goodness. As the first scripted movie collaboration between star Sacha Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles it riffs wildly on fish-out-of-water and rom-com cliches that are known to go flabby when a film runs long. Crazy humor be it an interior-vagina scene or a dazzlingly counterintuitive scene in ""Forrest Gump"" works best in concentrated doses. Like so much of Cohens work ""The Dictators"" over-the-top rant against the rank lunacy of authoritarianism deploys comedy like an act of violence; its outrageous quick and leaves us breathless whether from laughter or shock. Cohen of ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" fame plays Adm. Gen. Aladeen the fulsomely bearded and beribboned dictator of a fictitious North African country called Wadiya. As satire goes most of this is too broad to cut deeply but it is undeniably propulsive and funny. The shtick in ""The Dictator"" is an exercise in overstatement that allows Cohen to embody That Which We Hate and imbue it with an unexpected birdbrained cuddliness.

FD-07524 Photo Melinda Sue Gordon Paramount Pictures The Dictator review despot with heart 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Yes there is something cuddly about him - maybe its the dark eyes or the whack-job innocence in them as he presses home the idiocy of a gag. True hes playing a vicious murderous despotic boob but hes playing a vicious murderous despotic boob with a latent nice streak. Aladeen just doesnt know any better. Hes as ignorant of moral strictures as he is of masturbation rendered moot by ubiquitous babes. Instructed in both by love interest Zoey (a cropped Anna Faris doing her best work in eons) the misguided tyrant thus embarks on what he later classifies as ""his spiritual journey man - like Eat Pray Love. "" Zoey meets the admiral general when he visits New York to respond to U.N. demands over Wadiyas nuclear weapons program. He gets kidnapped debearded and replaced by an imbecilic goat-herding double before escaping into a crowd of protesters. There he meets the peacenik piliferous Zoey and the movie softens and sweetens with cliche. The multiple-author screenplay by Cohen and the three who co-wrote ""EuroTrip"" is a mix of comic bombshells and conventional plot devices that add up to an entertaining goof. This isnt the last word on cinematic send-ups of totalitarianism - for that we still have Charlie Chaplins ""The Great Dictator"" - but its a fine and riotous jab in the ribs.

"Dictator The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; dictator-the ) Dictator The (United States 2012) May 15 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli One of the cleverest moments in Sacha Baron Cohens The Dictator comes during the first five seconds a memorial dedication to Kim Jong Il. Its all downhill from there. To be fair the movies relentlessly un-PC humor results in some hilarious sequences but they occur unevenly and are buffered by a storyline that could have been lifted from an Adam Sandler film. In fact thats largely what The Dictator feels like something Sandler might make if he was interested in fashioning a satire of global politics. The material in The Dictator is of the sort that lends itself to a trailer and various publicity stunts. As a short or a Saturday Night Live extract it could have been gleefully absurd and incisive. But laden with a painfully underwritten narrative it quickly becomes obvious that the concept cannot support a feature length film (or at least not this feature length film). The opening is promising. We are introduced to Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen) the dictator of the (fictional) oil rich nation of Wadiya (which neighbors Somalia and Ethiopia in North Africa). Aladeen is perhaps the most narcissistic man on the planet. He has slept with just about every major celebrity (an early scene shows Megan Fox getting out of his bed and refusing to cuddle with him) holds his own version of the Olympics (where he wins every event) and is pursuing an active nuclear program. While in New York preparing to make a speech before the U.N. Aladeen is betrayed by his right-hand man Tamir (Ben Kingsley) who seeks to replace the Supreme Leader with his body double. Aladeen escapes from his kidnappers but is unable to convince anyone of his true identity. He finds shelter with Zoey (Anna Faris) the proprietor of a vegan health store. He is helped in his bid to regain his rightful position by Nadal (Jason Mantoukas) the exiled former head of Aladeens nuclear program. The Dictator exhausts the majority of its cleverness and creativity in its first fifteen minutes. After that it churns through obligatory plot points on its way to a disappointingly vanilla ending. There are worthwhile comedic vignettes along the way - the helicopter scene with Nadal and Aladeen referencing Osama Bin Laden and his Porsche 911 while fellow passengers squirm is laugh-aloud funny but the humor is more often than not disappointing. The best thing that can be said of Cohens brand of jokes is that he holds nothing sacred. Its hard to imagine anything being off-bounds for him; the word ""taboo"" does not apply. But those familiar with his previous projects are aware of that. Borat the film that rocketed Cohen from his small niche of cable TV fame to big screen notoriety and stardom may have become a millstone around the actors neck. His follow-up Bruno emerged as a pale imitation of Borat an attempt to re-capture lightning in a bottle. The Dictator although not employing one of Cohens The Ali G. Show personalities often seems to be mining similar veins of comedy. Director Larry Charles who helmed Borat and Bruno brings a similar sensibility to this film but the sly vicious wit is undercut by the lifeless script which destroys much of what could be compelling about The Dictator by forcing structure upon it. The plot-by-numbers story isnt merely clumsy; its insulting and damaging. Had The Dictator followed the blueprint of its first fifteen minutes the experience would have been entirely different. The movie collapses once it throws Aladeen onto the streets of New York City where it cant even manage a good fish-out-of-water tale. The in-your-face way-too-obvious political message at the climax is presented with all the subtlety of a Michael Moore documentary. Even those who agree with it are likely to find it sloppily shoehorned in. One has to admire Cohens willingness to do just about anything for a joke including reveal whats under his robes (although that could have been a prosthetic or CGI). As comedians go hes among the most daring but more than chutzpah is needed to transform a good idea into a good movie. Cohens love interest is played by Anna Faris who dyed her hair dark and cut it short in order for her to closely resemble the ""boy"" Aladeen initially believes her to be. Faris is either miscast or underused or more probably both. She and Cohen evidence no chemistry although the alove story"" aspect is so badly conceived and developed that its worth wondering whether any actress could have pulled it off. Maybe Meryl Streep. Speaking of Oscar winners Streep may not be on hand but Ben Kingsley is proving once again that Kingsley is among the least picky Sirs when it comes to accepting roles. At times The Dictator plays out like a war between two movies a savvy barbed satire and a flaccid generic potty-mouthed comedy. Unfortunately when the balance sheet is tallied by the end of the final credits the latter has won the battle.

This time out though the writer-performer has created a full-on narrative rather than foisting creations like Borat and Bruno onto unsuspecting civilians in a mockumentary. As it turns out a scripted Baron Cohen isnt quite as fun to watch as one whos madly improvising in potentially dangerous situations. But for all the movies messiness and lack of conviction Baron Cohen makes so many of his gags stick to the wall that its easy to forgive the films many flaws. Aladeen (Baron Cohen) runs the oil-rich Northern African nation of Wadiya with an iron fist. Whether hes ordering the development of a nuclear program paying millions to bed down starlets like Megan Fox or ordering the execution of civilians for the most minor of offenses hes one of the most dreaded despots in the world. Not that anyone would dare make a movie about someone so utterly irredeemable mind you. In the screenplay by Baron Cohen Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer Aladeen just needs to be loved (Megan Fox refuses to stick around for cuddling despite his pleas) and hes not even as powerful as he thinks he is (all the people he believes hes executed have been exiled to the ""Little Wadiya"" neighborhood of New York City). Heck Aladeen isnt even the villain of the piece -- that would be his second-in-command and rightful heir to the Wadiyan throne Tamir (Ben Kingsley). Tamir plans to kill Aladeen on the day before the leaders address to the United Nations replace him with a half-witted look-alike goatherd (Baron Cohen also plays Efawadh) and then get the fake Aladeen to sign a new constitution that will allow foreign oil interests to bleed the country dry while making Tamir a billionaire. Aladeen escapes his assassin but finds himself beardless and unrecognizable in New York. Mistaken for a Wadiyan dissident hes taken in by organic grocer Zoey (Anna Faris) and teams up with exiled nuclear scientist Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) to foil Tamirs scheme. Comparisons to Chaplins ""The Great Dictator"" are inevitable perhaps but Baron Cohen doesnt really seem to have any kind of political agenda in mind. Aladeen is just another larger-than-life idiot in the comedians repertoire but there are plenty of laughs to be had at his expense. The egotistical ruler has replaced many words in the Wadiyan language with ""Aladeen"" for example including ""open"" ""closed"" ""positive"" and ""negative"" making restaurant signage and HIV testing confusing to say the least. The film also gets a few digs in at the U.S. new-millennial jitters with Aladeen and Nadals conversation in Wadiyan about the rulers Porsche 911 making some fellow tourists very anxious. Its a good thing the gags work because this slight comedy clocking in at under 80 minutes can barely be bothered with actual storytelling. It took four screenwriters to decide that Zoeys tiny little Brooklyn tree-hugging store would get the gig to cater the signing of the new Wadiyan constitution with diplomats from around the world in attendance? Baron Cohens latest comedic regime is a shaky one -- but hey at least the trains run on time. Breaking News To Your Inbox.

(AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Melinda Sue Gordon) Dictator Crude Dictator is sure to get laughs BY JOE WILLIAMS  Post-Dispatch Film Critic gt; joewilliamspost-dispatch.com gt; 314-340-8344 May 15 2012 (...) Melinda Sue Gordon In this film image released by Paramount Pictures Sacha Baron Cohen portrays Admiral General Aladeen in a scene from ""The Dictator."" (AP Photo/Paramount Pictures Melinda Sue Gordon) The villain with a secretly soft heart is a storytelling tradition at least as old as Shakespeare. In modern times his comedic cousins include the Grinch and Dr. Evil but the gold standard is the titular tyrant in Charlie Chaplins ""The Great Dictator.""Provocateur Sacha Baron Cohen exposed the dark side of ordinary Americans in two pseudo documentaries the revelatory ""Borat"" and the revolting ""Bruno."" But he exhausted that gimmick and ""The Dictator"" is a scripted comedy that consciously adapts the Chaplin strategy to the era of terrorism. Cohens film is too crass to become a classic but anyone who doesnt surrender some guilty guffaws is a candidate for a re-education camp.Admiral General Aladeen (Cohen) is the proud potentate of the north African nation of Wadiya. Drunk with oil money he dispatches dissenters with a wave of his hand. But money cant buy him love. None of the well-compensated celebrities on his wall of sexual conquests are willing to cuddle with him and when Aladeen visits the U.N. his closest adviser (Ben Kingsley) has him kidnapped and replaced with an idiotic lookalike. After Aladeen outwits his torturer (John C. Reilly) the de-bearded dictator finds himself free but friendless on the streets of New York. In a new age-y neighborhood in Brookyn he is mistaken for an anti-Aladeen protestor by feminist grocery clerk Zoey (Anna Faris delightfully dizzy as usual) who offers him a job.While reeling from the double whammy of love and multiculturalism Aladeen enlists exiled Wadiyan scientist Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) to help him reclaim the throne. Like Russell Brand Cohen is a smartly subversive comedian who chafes from formulaic schtick. Much of his politically incorrect humor is too crude and ghastly to have a lasting impact but fencing with Faris and Mantzoukas keeps him sharp and a speech where Aladeen compares democracy to dictatorship is one of the most acutely funny scenes of the year. ""The Dictator"" is too short and undisciplined to be a world-class comedy but its chutzpah deserves respect.The DictatorThree stars (out of four)  Rating R  Run time 123  Content Crude and sexual content strong language and some violence Summer movies Its a superhero smackdown Comic book avengers and movie-sequel aliens will be chasing one another at the box office.

Comments click to enlarge The Dictator Video Rated R  83 minutes  2012 Now that Sacha Baron Cohen is too famous to get away with the hit-and-run pranks of Borat or Da Ali G Show hes just another superstar comedian playing to the cheap seats. His grotesque ethnic this time around is Admiral General Shabazz Aladeen a vain North African strongman reminiscent of Saddam and Gaddafi and for every clever gag (a video game that gives points for beheading Westerners) there are three stupid gross-outs (drinking urine milking a womans breasts licking a lovers armpits). Cohen probably thinks hes Charlie Chaplin lampooning Hitler but of course Hitler was still on top of the world when The Great Dictator came out in 1940; Cohen is actually Chaplins antithesis a first-world bully content to target the Other.

Photo Credit MCT advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A dethroned Middle Eastern tyrant vows to save his country from democracy. BOTTOM LINE Outrageously offensive and shamefully funny. Just forgive yourself and keep laughing. CAST Sacha Baron Cohen Anna Faris Ben Kingsley Jason Mantzoukas LENGTH 123 Its easy enough for me to laugh at Sacha Baron Cohens ""The Dictator"" and I did heartily. After all Im not a torture victim a limbless refugee or a lackey living in constant fear of execution all of whom become punch lines in this hugely offensive outrageously funny farce. As for the jokes about college-educated culturally sensitive types -- now those are just hurtful. ""The Dictator"" stars Cohen as General Admiral Haffaz Aladeen ruler of the fictional North African country Wadiya (as you must already know thanks to Cohens months-long in-character publicity campaign). Covered in medals and odd facial hair Aladeen bears a resemblance to Adenoid Hynkel the Hitler parody in Charlie Chaplins ""The Great Dictator"" but its history that makes Aladeen recognizable. With his personalized salute (a one-finger heil) and cheerful bloodlust (he plays a Wii game called ""The Munich Olympics"") Aladeen could be any number of Husseins or Qaddafis. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The story is a golden oldie While visiting New York Aladeen is kidnapped by pro-democracy thugs and replaced by a double (also Cohen in another nod to Chaplin). But this is mainly an excuse for Cohen to say hilariously horrible things (""You have a rape center here? Great"") and indulge in some rather gratuitous gross-out humor. Anna Faris as Aladeens earthy-crunchy love interest Zoey is woefully underused as is Ben Kingsley as a scheming cabinet member but Jason Mantzoukas (FXs ""The League"") is a real find matching Cohen riff for ridiculous riff as Aladeens helpmate Nadal. ""The Dictator"" steers clear of religion -- no fatwas please -- but the Middle East may soon be standing in the complaints line with Kazhakstan still steamed over Cohens ""Borat."" Then again Wall Streeters the media the Bush administration and the average voting-age American also take a shellacking when Aladeen in a brilliant closing speech paints a deadly accurate picture of a dictatorial USA. Whos laughing now? PLOT A dethroned Middle Eastern tyrant vows to save his country from democracy.

(JOE KLAMAR/AFP/Getty Images) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Tuesday May 15 2012 800 AM Title The Dictator Film Info With Sacha Baron Cohen Anna Faris. Satire about a Middle East tyrant who falls for a Brooklyn feminist. Director Larry Charles (123). R Crude humor sexuality nudity language violence. At area theaters. When a movie opens by dedicating itself ""In loving memory of Kim Jong-Il"" its pretty safe to say all bets are off. And indeed Sacha Baron Cohens often hilarious ""The Dictator"" wanders into territory guaranteed to outrage as many viewers as possible. There are jokes about terrorism abortion suicide and pedophilia. We view parts of Baron Cohen (or his stunt double) that we have seen before and should never have to see again. The easily offended will be appalled. The rarely offended may be appalled. But theyll have to stop laughing long enough to realize it. As in the past Baron Cohen has teamed up with director Larry Charles his partner in gleeful discomfort. Though characteristically sharp this effort lacks the spontaneous element of danger that drove their previous films. When things run off the rails its evident theyre meant to - as opposed to the jaw-dropping moments in ""Borat"" ""Bruno"" or ""Da Ali G Show"" which relied on unscripted surprises. RELATED SACHA BARON COHEN IS QUITE THE CHARACTER Baron Cohen plays Gen. Admiral Haffaz Aladeen the violently racist misogynistic and megalomaniacal leader of the (fake) North African nation of Wadiya. After the West denounces his attempts to build a nuclear bomb Aladeen joins his uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley) on a trip to the United Nations where he can pretend to set the worlds mind at ease. Tamir has his own hidden agenda which involves a double (also Baron Cohen) who takes over when they arrive in New York. With nowhere else to go the newly deposed Aladeen winds up at a vegan co-op in Brooklyn. Its run by the ultra-liberal Zoey (Anna Faris) who mistakes him for a political prisoner. Much to his surprise he starts falling for her even as he plots a secret return to power. The filmmakers push as many buttons as possible No subject is off-limits and there will be times when you wont believe what youre watching. Surely this is the first movie in which the central couple flirt while holding hands inside another womans body. Baron Cohen goes for and gets big laughs over silly asides like the sight of Megan Fox making some quick money. But his best jokes are the edgiest the ones that acknowledge unpleasant realities with both wit and daringly blunt force (as in his comparison between dictatorships and contemporary America). Hes a political satirist with a peerless sense of the preposterous. For all its absurdities ""The Dictator"" is both more structured and more polished than his earlier works. It also shows enough unexpected heart that one could almost call it a traditional romantic comedy. Of course few contemporary rom-coms involve a murderous despot who falls in love with a razor-averse feminist co-op owner. Baron Cohen makes a pretty good case that there should be more.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Though the idea of placing wacky made-up characters in a real-life context was carried over from Da Ali G Show--wherein Buzz Aldrin was once asked if he was upset that Michael Jackson got all the credit for inventing the moonwalk--Sacha Baron Cohens Borat felt like something new an attempt to square an improvised guerrilla style of underground comedy with reality-TV stunt shows like Jackass or Fear Factor. Unlike Ali G Indahouse Baron Cohens failed attempt to bring his most famous character into an entirely fictional universe Borat found the comic tension in placing his Kazakhstani buffoon in delicate social situations like a rodeo where he supports the ""War Of Terror"" a bit too zealously. But the ingenuity of Borat was never sustainable partly because Baron Cohen became too famous to go incognito but mainly because what was once wholly original quickly seemed like formula from familiar onscreen pranks to his wearying press conferences and public appearances. Bruno was a case of diminishing returns intermittently amusing but not nearly as bracing or funny as Borat--it didnt help that Bruno was the most thinly conceived of all his Da Ali G Show characters--and the lead-up to Baron Cohens new comedy The Dictator made it look like hed boxed himself into a corner. And in his desperation hed perhaps retreated to giving another wacky made-up character--Admiral General Aladeen oppressive leader of the North African oil state of Wadiya--the Ali G Indahouse treatment. Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles have indeed retreated with The Dictator but theyve gone back 80 years when the Marx Brothers were given carte blanche at Paramount Pictures with a five-movie run that ended with their best movie 1933s Duck Soup. Baron Cohens new creation (and the previous ones too) has its roots in Groucho characters like Captain Jeffrey T. Spaulding Otis B. Driftwood and Prof. Quincy Adams Wagstaff and the concept of a pompous simpleton running a rogue nation has obvious parallels to Duck Soups Rufus T. Firefly who leads the country of Fredonia to a needless and highly preventable war. Though Duck Soup has a comics contempt for authority and offers some barbs on the collective madness of nationalism its less a satire than another premise for the brothers usual pranks and tomfoolery. As ever theyre more inclined to celebrate anarchy than speaking truth to power. Also hailing from Paramount Pictures The Dictator refers more directly and pointedly to real-life political developments but it otherwise follows the Duck Soup model of hanging all kinds of comedy--physical and verbal lowbrow and highbrow satirical and gross-out--on the misadventures of a brazen Rufus T. Firefly type. This gives Baron Cohen and Charles the freedom to goof hilariously on the decadence and villainy of Axis Of Evil sorts while sidewinding into Borscht Belt gags or the visual spoofery of a Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker comedy. In other words anything goes which is as sturdy a comic modus operandi as any especially if most of the jokes hit. Created from a genetic pool that includes Gaddafi Ahmadinejad Kim Jong-il Saudi royalty and Husseins sons at their friskiest Admiral General Aladeen opens the movie with the modern dictators favorite international provocation the development of nuclear power. Aladeens stated ambition to use this energy for ""peaceful purposes""--he even cracks himself up with that one--doesnt appease the international community which calls for sanctions or worse if he doesnt allow inspectors into the country. (Turns out to be a bluff His insistence on ""pointy"" missiles has set the project back considerably.) When a defiant Aladeen heads to the United Nations in New York to make his case a resistance movement within Wadiya led by his second-in-command Tamir (Ben Kingsley) sends him off course. Tamir arranges for Aladeen to be abducted tortured and left for dead and replaces him with a dim-witted sheepherding body double who makes the startling announcement that Wadiya is to become a democracy. Meanwhile the now-beardless Aladeen gets humbled in much the same way as Eddie Murphys benevolent royal in Coming To America except instead of mopping up a McDonalds he teams up with Zoey (Anna Faris) the hippie proprietor of a Brooklyn organic grocery. Taking advantage of her haughty obliviousness--Faris is every bit Margaret Dumont to Baron Cohens Groucho--Aladeen conspires to seize power back and tear up the new constitution before its too late. For as much fun as Charles Baron Cohen and their writers have with their cartoon amalgam of modern-day monarchs The Dictators true satirical agenda is reserved for the democracies that would hand a newly ""free"" country like Wadiya over to BP and Exxon. When Baron Cohen finally gets the opportunity to hit this theme hard he uncorks a monologue that sharpens his sometimes-ramshackle comedy to a point. Its here where he and Groucho part ways--Groucho was not a satirist by nature and thats long been Baron Cohens stock in trade. But elsewhere Admiral General Aladeen and Rufus T. Firefly share the same bloodline representing a more generalized contempt for world leaders of any stripe whether they don a ""supreme beard"" or a greasepaint moustache. The Dictator keeps the gags coming as fast as it can manage sometimes in big gross-out setpieces like an impromptu baby delivery but more often in the general fusillade of hit-or-miss jokes that hit at a better-than-average rate. While Aladeen certainly has a place in Baron Cohens gallery of human cartoons the key point about The Dictator is that its a departure from his previous films and not another trip to the well. His needling instincts to shock and provoke are still present--and still merrily juvenile--but the film is both more conventional than Borat and Bruno and a more accommodating vehicle for different types of comedy. In reaching back to the past Baron Cohen finds a viable way forward.

Needless to say its a romantic comedy. Starring Sacha Baron Cohen Anna Faris Ben Kingsley Director Larry Charles Release Opened May 16 2012  Editorial Review A hit-and-mostly-miss DictatorBy Ann HornadayTuesday May 15 2012""In loving memory of Kim Jong-Il"" reads an epigraph at the beginning of ""The Dictator"" Sacha Baron Cohens latest send-up of political manners and American exceptionalism. Its true that the character Cohen plays an aggressively bearded tyrant named Admiral General Aladeen who has ruled the North African country of Wadiya since he was 7 embodies all of the absurdities of despotic power including its preening vanity and chronic insecurity. As portrayed by Cohen the egotistical belligerent Aladeen bumbles through everything -- from sexual encounters with paid starlets to the executions he orders for the most innocuous perceived slight -- like Uday Qusay Larry Moe and Curly combined. (He describes himself as the last in a long line of now-fallen dictators ""Kim Gaddafi Saddam Cheney."") But once Aladeen comes to America -- to speak at the United Nations about his nuclear arms buildup -- Cohens target area widens from reactionary abuses of power overseas to political correctness and unearned moral arrogance on these shores. When Aladeen is supposedly assassinated and his body double steps in he finds himself beardless and abroad in 21st-century New York where he meets a vegan-feminist collective grocer named Zoey (Anna Faris); their budding friendship invites nonstop jokes about lesbianism underarm hair and fundamental cultural and political misunderstandings. ""The police here are so fascist"" Zoey cries after Aladeen is temporarily taken into custody. ""Yeah and not in a good way"" Aladeen retorts. Thats one of the few throwaway lines that are genuinely amusing in ""The Dictator"" which never achieves the stinging parodic heights of Cohens ""Borat"" but manages a better batting average than his most recent misfire ""Bruno."" Cohen has thankfully dispensed with ambushing real-life people for squirm-inducing interviews. But an early stunt involving a Wii game based on the 1972 Munich Olympics falls flatter than a stale matzoh a running gag about Hollywood stars selling sexual favors quickly loses steam and it can be stipulated that rape jokes simply arent funny. More debatable is the ""too soon"" question regarding the films satirical centerpiece -- in which Aladeen takes a helicopter ride and alarms two American tourists while speaking excitedly in Wadiyan about his Porsche -- a ""911 2012."" As for bits involving a childbirth filmed from inside a womans birth canal (""Its a girl wheres the trash can?"" Aladeen mutters) and the severed head of a man whose funeral Aladeen raids for his beard ""The Dictator"" cant end soon enough. Then again at a lean 83 minutes it will be worth the ride for Cohen fans just to hear choice Arabic renditions of ""Everybody Hurts"" and ""Lets Get It On"" and for a pointed third-act speech questioning a democracy ruled by its wealthiest 1 percent (hint rhymes with ""Mamerica""). Even amid the hit-and-miss broadsides and laugh-free longueurs that comprise most of ""The Dictator"" Cohens acutehypocrisy-detector keeps on ticking if barely.

The gangly British comedian responsible for rabble-rousing characters Ali G and Bruno plays General Admiral Haffaz Aladeen ruthless ruler of the fictional North African nation of Wadiya and celebrity-bedding playa (his Polaroid wall of conquests includes LiLo Oprah and the former Governator). But during a visit to the United Nations to defend his countrys nuclear program the generals second-in-command (Ben Kingsley) stages a coup replacing the execution-happy dictator with an idiot impostor (also Baron Cohen). Off into the five-borough wilds our protagonist goes though this time the shtick is much more clearly scripted. Yet even minus the element of Borat-style surprise the laughs come at a furious clip Gut-busting scatological sight gags are prevalent (much comic mileage is wrung from a severed head on a stick and an INTVAGINA-cam) while a game Anna Faris as Aladeens health-food-store-running love interest parries every insult (""lesbian hobbit"") with fearless flair. Sheer stupidity is the order of the day--as in a Weird Al-worthy sequence scored to a Middle Eastern gibberish version of ""Everybody Hurts""--and viewer amusement is sure to vary. But even the stoniest face will crack when Aladeen sums up our cultural moment in a rousing uproarious climactic speech worthy of both Chaplin and Team America.

"The Dictator (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Dictator (R) In their third collaboration actor Sacha Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles (""Borat"" ""Bruno"") run their jokes into the ground. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com5/14/2012 Editor rating 1.5 The Dictator does for Sacha Baron Cohen what The Love Guru did for Mike Myers Reveal that this sharp revered comedian with an uncanny ear for absurdist humor is a mere mortal capable of great folly. The movie isnt bad enough to be a career killer the way Guru forced Myers into hiding. But the latest collaboration between Cohen and director Larry Charles proves the formula they created with Borat and then started to milk dry with Bruno has finally run out of juice. Time to move on guys. Unlike their previous two films which were shaped like documentaries The Dictator is populated entirely by actors (theres only one brief scene that appears to have been shot Candid Camera-ambush style for old times sake). The script is credited to Cohen and three other writers (veterans of Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm but also of Dr. Seuss The Cat in the Hat) yet still feels thin and underwritten - a collection of outrageous gags and jokes strung together by a slapdash plot no one really cares about least of all the filmmakers. The recent 21 Jump Street showed how story is critical to even the sillest comedies. But Cohens ego is so inflated he assumes hes enough to carry the show by himself. Most dispiriting of all The Dictator is at heart a romantic comedy that ends with one of those hackneyed scenes in which all the characters gather together to stand up and cheer while the musical score swells. The shock is that Cohen treats the moment perfectly straight. The actor plays Admiral General Omar Aladeen the mad despot of the North African country Wadiya which is rich with oil and struggling to start a nuclear weapons program. Aladeen agrees to visit the ""devils nest"" of America with his brother (Ben Kingsley) to address the United Nations but hes stripped of his power and identity soon after landing in New York. While plotting a way to regain his throne he takes a job at an eco-friendly grocery story run by a cheerful activist (Anna Faris) who gradually falls for the unusually blunt foreigner who always speaks his mind. Cohen is too gifted of a satirist to strike out completely with his conceits even when theyre as shaky and obvious as the imperious Aladeen who displays all the cultural stereotypes Westerners project on Arabs and Middle Easterners as if they were medals on his chest. There are lots of fleeting laughs in The Dictator Aladeen emerges from his mothers womb with a full beard and other bodily hair. His former head of nuclear research Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) has relocated to Manhattan where he works at the Genius Bar at an Apple store. When a pair of white-bread tourists overhears the two men speaking Arabic and saying ""2012 Porsche 911"" they automatically assume the worst. Like Cohens previous films The Dictator exploits racism and xenophobia for laughs flinging our deep-seated prejudices back in our faces for humor. But the approach isnt nearly as effective when its actors reading lines instead of real people accidentally revealing their own biases. Its funny to hear Aladeen say things like ""Educated women are like monkeys on roller skates Theyre so adorable"" because the joke taps into sexist views inherent to some degree in all cultures. Its not quite as amusing watching him play a video game in which he runs around shooting Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics or listening to an FBI goon (John C. Reilly in a cameo) rant about ""Ay-rabs"" and their dirty despicable ways. Every genuine laugh and creative gag in The Dictator is negated by a cheap or ugly joke - obvious jabs at racism that smack of self-importance as if Cohen were preaching to us. The movie also radiates a mean-spiritedness that Borat and Bruno avoided. ""Edgy"" terrorist humor alone doesnt cut it any more You have to do more than push the envelope and too much of The Dictator falls as flat as Cohens stunt of dumping ashes on Ryan Seacrest at the red carpet during the Oscars. The biggest laugh in the entire film comes in the opening shot - a title card dedicating the picture to the memory of Kim Jong Il. The rest of The Dictator sadly has no clothes.

If Groucho Marx were alive today he would probably make movies like ""The Dictator"" British comedian Baron Cohens latest subversive romp and searing showcase of crass global stereotypes. Transitioning back into a scripted dynamic after his quasi-documentary performance excursions with ""Bruno"" and ""Borat"" Baron Cohen loses none of his edge combining slapstick inspiration and social commentary into a hilariously provocative blend. The eponymous target is in fact a misnomer While the actor plays the ruthless and eccentric tyrant of the fictional Middle Eastern country Wadiya as always he remains an equal opportunity offender challenging audiences not to laugh at mean-spirited gags. His pies-in-the-face have bite. Baron Cohen initially became popular through ""Da Ali G Show"" less because of his cartoon alter egos than for the way he used them to mess with real people on camera a feat that continued in feature-length format with ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" to varying degrees of success. Admiral General Aladeen however exists in a fully controlled universe of lunacy. In ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" Baron Cohen used his horrific caricatures to bring out the veiled xenophobia of those around him resulting in a kind of free-form vignette-based comedy with a flimsy de facto narrative backbone. With ""The Dictator"" Baron Cohen and his fellow screenwriters call all the shots using the framework of a polished studio movie to unleash a horde of missives against dictatorial excess -- and eventually lumping U.S. capitalism into the same overarching critique. The new movie has less outrageous shock value but greater ideological clarity. If the earlier films were empirical quasi-journalistic takedowns ""The Dictator"" is a full-on op-ed. The movie begins with a clever mixture of authentic news footage and fictionalized material showing Aladeens posh life in Wadiya where the hedonistic ruler forces the entire nation to bend to his will and keeps the civilized world on edge with his blatant antagonism. The first act runs through a series of politically incorrect jabs at dictatorships. Equal parts Muammar Gaddafi and Billy Madison Aladeen casually orders the execution of anyone (literally) in his way sleeps with movie stars after dark and eagerly oversees the development of nuclear weaponry (he stifles a laugh when publicly claiming the bomb will only serve to keep the peace). Aladeens self-made paradise suddenly crumbles when he heads to New York in an attempt to tell off the U.N. and instead finds himself the target of an assassination attempt. Violently stripped of his trademark beard and escaping his torturer in the nick of time Aladeen hits the streets in an unrecognizable state only to discover his former right-hand man (Ben Kingsley competent if unmemorable) has sold him out. In the supreme rulers place a deeply dumb body double has been selected to tell the UN that Wadiya will become a democracy in order to satisfy other countries oil interests. Stuck outside the UN gates Aladeen falls into the care of Zoey (Anna Faris) a short-haired hippie who mistakes Aladeen for a Wadiyan dissident and brings him back to her headquarters in Brooklyn where she runs an organic food co-op. Once there Aladeen quietly schemes to take back his throne while growing oddly comfortable with his new surroundings. The discovery of his former chief scientist living undercover in nearby immigrant community Little Wadiya provides Aladeen with the tools to plan his comeback. But will his views evolve? In short yes but the real answer is not really. Once a dictator always a dictator. However in its journey to this conclusion the movie contains actual plot details not simply an endless barrage of ""gotcha"" moments which gives the movie a more cogent through-line for its humor than the documentary style of Baron Cohens earlier features. Just as Aladeen rules over his homeland Baron Cohen controls everyone and everything we see. Ironically a script frees him up Learning to masturbate rather than order up a blow job taking a food commissioner hostage to ensure the co-op receives top marks delivering a child and then offering because of its female gender to toss the infant in the trash -- these are the kind of the absurd bits that could never have existed in his previous efforts without taking the conceit too far. Thats right Baron Cohens films no matter their twisted rampantly offensive contents adhere to specific moral boundaries because they use their caustic silliness in service of a demagogic agenda. The man harbors serious contempt for his targets. Baron Cohen rarely does interviews but ""The Dictator"" builds on a dialogue instigated by his earlier efforts. ""Bruno"" unearthed ugly sentiments embedded in the American psyche; having proven they exist now Baron Cohen runs wild with a dark fantasy. ""The Dictator"" mocks our idea of a dictatorship more than actual dictatorships. The movie maintains its topical edge all the way through the final monologue which includes a plug for Occupy Wall Street and a missive against virtually every facet of modern American aristocracy. But its too funny to play like a blatant insult. Charles unassuming direction yields the look of a brightly lit action-comedy with a side dish of unlikely romance. Whenever ""The Dictator"" gets away from its dogma it automatically becomes a lesser movie and yet the overall inspiration driving the screenplay keeps it thoroughly amusing even when the story drags. The budding attraction between Zoey and Aladeen is generally a trite predictable affair but the very idea of the dictator falling in love opens the door for a plethora of one-liner delights (""When the thought of a decapitated head upsets you thats love""). Aladeen isnt an iconic creation like Ali G or Borat but Baron Cohen does manage to make him oddly relatable and the actor buries himself in the role. (An underutilized Faris plays the clueless activist well enough but nobody can compete with the leading man.) Hes one of the best comedians working today because he never slows down to get real; the only certainty with Aladeen is that his next move will be a funny one. No taboo escapes unscathed as the jokes merge with the message. The plucky nature of Baron Cohens protagonists harken back to Chaplin -- and the easiest point of comparison is ""The Great Dictator"" right down to the crude Western imitation of foreign language that forms Wadiyas native tongue -- but the creators of Wadiya owe a tremendous debt to ""Duck Soup"" and its own fictionalized dictatorship Freedonia. Like Marx Baron Cohen gets away with saying a lot more than most popular entertainers because he buries his satire in a disarming giddiness. For everything startling about Baron Cohens shtick the source of satisfaction in his work is decisively old school. Criticwire grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Paramount releases ""The Dictator"" nationwide on Wednesday. It seems unlikely to compete with ""The Avengers"" but solid reviews and an existing fan base for Baron Cohens work guarantee the movie should perform respectably without generating outstanding returns.

By CHRIS VOGNAR cvognardallasnews.com Movie Critic Published 11 May 2012 0704 PM Updated 11 May 2012 0704 PM Sacha Baron Cohens most infamous characters were designed to inflict maximum discomfort on audiences and unsuspecting participants alike. But by now the imbecilic Kazakh Borat the flamboyantly gay fashionista Bruno and the hapless Ali G are all known commodities their ambush tactics made null and void without the element of surprise. Whats a tasteless comedian to do?Time to take a plunge in the same scripted comedy murk as the rest of the yuksters. In The Dictator opening Wednesday Cohen sporting the mother of all fake beards delivers a full-frontal assault on well pretty much everything. Terrorism American perceptions of terrorism geopolitics celebrities (including the many who make cameos here) vegan feminist nonprofit health food cooperatives All are fair game in Cohens scorched-earth satire about a Middle East general who in the tradition of Eddie Murphys Prince Akeem comes to America.Cohen working with a team that includes Borat and Bruno director Larry Charles remains a vexing comic figure. Moments of The Dictator which clocks in at a sketchlike 83 minutes play out with a gleeful sense of anarchism that the Marx Brothers might appreciate. ""The police here are such fascists"" complains the feminist nonprofit health food cooperative manager (an unrecognizable and deftly deadpan Anna Faris). ""Yeah I know and not in a good way"" retorts Cohens General Aladeen falling for his unlikely hostess.But Cohen and his writers are nowhere near above shock cuts to various body parts or a gag in which a bumbling leader of Wadiya the movies fictional homeland pours a pitcher of urine over an Israeli U.N. delegation. Without real people to antagonize The Dictator is left to break down every boundary of taste imaginable. If nothing here offends you take a bow on behalf of your stout constitution. If nothing here makes you laugh you might need to loosen up a tad.Taking a page from Charlie Chaplin and The Great Dictator (a film it will never be confused with) Cohen gives himself a second role and his Supreme Leader a benign doppelganger. The rural bumpkin drafted as a decoy by Aladeens scheming henchman (Ben Kingsley) has a steep learning curve Faced with a bevy of beauties he tries to milk one of them. Not all of the gross-out gags are quite as uninspired. Taught to masturbate for the first time the general experiences a series of euphoric visions including a soaring eagle a school of dolphins -- and a dunking Blake Griffin.The Dictator can do cheap and easy by the bushel and the 9/11 gags can be squirm-inducing. However befitting a movie whose threadbare plot includes the formation of a new constitution it proves rather democratic in choosing its targets. Cohen may very well miss the opportunity to create (and stage) awkward encounters out in the real world but dont make the mistake of thinking hes gone subtle.Or that hes ignorant of the age-old idea that romance conquers all. ""When the sight of someones decapitated head makes you upset"" advises Aladeens right-hand man ""that is love."" Its enough to make a despot cry.The Dictator(B)Directed by Larry Charles.

"Dictator movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs The Dictator quality falls between Borat and Bruno ?? 1/2May 11 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticFor most of its quick and extremely dirty running time the new Sacha Baron Cohen offender ""The Dictator"" wages war with itself crude nonsense up against crude nonsense thats really funny. Then comes the golden ticket the speech of speeches the scene in which the fictional North African dictator General Admiral Haffaz Aladeen addresses a gathering in New York City recanting his barbarous ways with a heartfelt confessional.You Americans dont know how good you have it here he states. Where he comes from he says the top 1 percent controls most of the wealth. Leaders cant wait to wage war on the wrong country. And on and on he goes. The jokes both predictable and familiar yet it kills.At the ""Dictator"" screening Thursday night the scene started out one way -- scoring easy points with its target audience of liberals -- but by the end with Cohen finessing the loutish Supreme Leaders spiel just so the applause in the theater sounded positively bipartisan.This was the old ""Borat"" stuff And I wish director Larry Charles third outing with Cohen had more of it. Its maddeningly uneven though a step up from the wearying ""Bruno."" Since ""Borat"" something has happened to Charles comic technique The way he films simple dialogue exchanges has grown weirdly artless and often mistimed (the editing is mighty hacky) halfway to Adam Sandler territory for broadness. I stuck with it though because Cohen at his best is both brazen and sly. As is ""The Dictator.""This ones plottier than ""Borat"" or ""Bruno""for better or worse. When one of Aladeens doubles is assassinated the leaders longtime advisor (Ben Kingsley looking a little uncomfortable) hatches a scheme involving a new double (also played by Cohen) a visit to the dreaded America and an unlikely romance with a vegan/feminist/Rush Limbaugh nightmare played by Anna Faris. Shes game and a strong sparring partner for Cohens unending misogynist wisecracks.Like Faris Jason Mantzoukas lends valuable support in the role of Aladeens former nuclear physicist presumed assassinated (by Aladeen). He turns up as one of countless refugees from Aladeens country Wadiya now living in the Manhattan subsection known as Little Wadiya.The better gags in ""The Dictator"" move fast and get on with it as when we hear a news announcer intone ""He did not know his mother who died in childbirth"" while we see two or three seconds of footage of an armed guard smothering Aladeens mother with a pillow. (Harsh but amusing). In contrast when Aladeens clueless goat-herder double-swigs urine out of a pitcher and pours it inadvertently on Israeli council members...harsh but un-amusing. Its not filmed correctly. Re-watch ""Borat"" sometime to see how fearless satirists get away with murder. This movies more conventional. But its worth catching for Cohens brief shining Camelot moment at the podium.mjphillipstribune.comThe Dictator -- 2 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for strong crude and sexual content brief male nudity and some violent images)Running time 124Opens Wednesday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Life Skill 201 Washing a baseball capLongtime nursing home operators must face trial judge rules10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesBehind the mustacheNovember 16 2006Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit...November 3 2006Cohen will never be able to top BoratJanuary 19 2007If Oscars want young viewers Borat should be hostFebruary 9 2007Find More Stories AboutSacha Baron CohenBoratSupreme LeaderTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0514-dictator-20120515,0,4685250.column",200,thedictator35,thedictator,chicagotribune

This latest outrage from Sacha Baron Cohen and director Larry Charles continues the template set down in Borat and Bruno offering the spectacle of an outlandishly foreign preposterously unreconstructed ego monster set loose on American soil. Despite its timeliness - North African despots are so hot right now - The Dictator has far less satirical bite than its predecessors and is flimsier as filmmaking. But its funny as hell.Admiral General Aladeen (Baron Cohen) beloved oppressor since childhood of fictional rogue state Wadiya enjoys a trigger-happy life of inane luxury and whimsical terror. A run-in with weapons inspectors necessitates a visit to the UN in New York where things swiftly go from Crocodile Dundee to After Hours Aladeen finds himself adrift in Brooklyn avoiding dissident diners in Little Wadiya and working at a vegan feminist cooperative run by adorably strident Zoey (Anna Faris). Theres also some business with a former underling (Jason Mantzoukas) and a nefarious rival (Ben Kingsley underused) in the run-up to the signing of a new democratic mandate for Wadiya.Theres a lightweight quality to The Dictator compared to its predecessors. The fact that Aladeens delusions of grandeur arent quite delusions - he does run a country after all - makes him less compelling than Ali G Borat or Bruno while the films other characters and plotting are perfunctory. Most regrettable is the loss of the candid-camera interactions with real-life stooges that allowed Borat and especially Bruno to take a genuinely sharp satirical edge to American culture; nor is there any substantial engagement with the mechanics of actual oppression. As some lame shtick with Aladeens imbecilic double makes clear The Great Dictator this aint - although one wittily subversive speech towards the end is pleasingly barbed.Still if a comedy is meant to make you laugh mission accomplished. As a series of wonderfully grotesque set-pieces The Dictator delivers from the Munich massacre a la Wii and a helicopter ride from hell to hipster blowback and genital slapstick. Baron Cohens talents as a clown find their the ideal vehicle in this onslaught of sheer tastelessness - a cluster-bomb of comic coups enveloping neo-cons and fem-lit torture and amniotic fluid linguistics and architecture wanking and severed heads. And there is room for one touching moment when Aladeen sees Zoey haranguing a cop her finger in his face her features a mask of indignant self-regard he realises this might just be the girl for him.

His movie The Dictator is like Coming To America with rape jokes. Not to be too hard on his first completely fictional feature. Despite some flat gags and attempts to be offensive that are too transparent (The Dictator plays a Munich Olympics first-person shooter game?) The Dictators joke-to-laughs ratio is at least higher than the average Saturday Night Live movie. Like an SNL movie The Dictator is one gag stretched as far as it can go (in this case not very long youll be home in time for the end of the game). But for every puerile bit (while in America the Dictator learns to masturbate a skill he never needed when women were always available) theres something smartly written as when Baron Cohens character is abducted and hurts the feelings of his would-be torturer (John C. Reilly) by mocking his out-of-date torture instruments with an expert eye. But its a letdown compared to the constant thrill of imminent violence - from real-life rednecks moneyed bigots and homophobes - who were punkd in the mockumentaries Borat and Bruno. That added something visceral to the humour that most of us had never seen before. The result is that The Dictator isnt as outrageous or screamingly funny as Borat. There are laughter-free stretches. And yet the character of Admiral General Aladeen of the North African Republic of Wadiya begins to grow on us. When we meet Aladeen hes happily ordering people to death on a whim and having sex with dictator-groupie celebrities like Megan Fox (in a cameo). Moreover hes got the world on edge over his claim that hes on the verge of nuclear capability (Geez who isnt?). This claim is undermined by him ordering the death of the countrys only nuclear scientist Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) after arguing over whether the missile should be pointy or round-headed. With that in a fit of hubris Aladeen heads to New York accompanied by his scheming aide Tamir (Ben Kingsley) and a moronic double to address the UN. A botched assassination later Aladeen is on the streets of Manhattan beardless mingling with mobs that are protesting the dictators visit. Taken under wing by Zoey the manager of a feminist organic grocery (Anna Faris) whom he dismisses as ""a lesbian hobbit"" Aladeen uses the store as a headquarters for a plan to take back the podium and derail Tamirs nefarious plan to turn the country into a democracy (with liberty and justice for oil interests). He even gets help from the still-alive Nadal who wants his old job back. The best fish-out-of-water comedy comes when Aladeens sensibilities collide with Zoeys (hes intrigued to hear about a ""rape centre"" and says educated women ""are like monkeys on roller skates. They dont know what theyre doing but its so adorable"") Interestingly though Aladeen seems patterned on Moammar Gadhafi Baron Cohen takes pains to not mention Islam and at one point Aladeen pointedly denies being an Arab. This despite the fact that the soundtrack includes songs like Everybody Hurts and Lets Get It On sung in what sounds like pidgin Arabic. I guess Baron Cohen really is tired of living dangerously.

Having pulled the improv equivalent of streaking through a mosque with ""Borats"" ambush tactics Sacha Baron Cohen retreats behind the veil of scripted comedy in ""The Dictator."" Admiral Gen. Omar Aladeen may be the funnymans most daring persona to date and yet most of the jokes land in safely non-offending territory -- unless you happen to be an oppressive Middle Eastern warmonger. Although watching Baron Cohen ham it up in-character for press conferences and the Oscars begs the question why he saved the funniest stuff for offcamera such exposure should help ""The Dictator"" overthrow ""Bruno"" at the box office. ""Bruno"" posed a number of problems for the outrageous comic. First it left many feeling that Baron Cohens pranks had gone too far shifting from the ""gotcha"" satire of ""Borat"" to downright mean attacks on good-ol-boy Americans. It also exhausted the last of Baron Cohens three characters from ""Da Ali G Show"" suggesting that wherever he went next it would mean having to create a character from scratch. And so Aladeen was born his full Osama bin Laden-style beard already in place the heir to the bloodthirsty oil-drunk North African nation of Wadiya. Rather than challenging audience prejudices Baron Cohen exploits them by presenting this ruthless world leader as an object of scorn and ridicule -- the easiest of targets. Aladeen makes up the rules as he goes rigging Wadiyas Olympics Golden Globes and other major events in his favor while calling for the beheading of anyone who opposes him. When Lewis Carrolls Queen of Hearts called ""Off with their heads"" the satire reflected back on the English monarchy but in Aladeens case its a bad-taste reminder of the merciless way Saddam Hussein Muammar Gaddafi and Kim Jong-il dealt with dissidents. (The film is dedicated to the memory of the late North Korean despot.) Despite his many crimes against humanity Aladeen is despised by no one more than Wadiyas rightful heir Tamir (Ben Kingsley) who first plots the Supreme Leaders assassination then shifts to the more elaborate plan of luring him to New York and replacing him with a dim-witted body double Efawadh (also Baron Cohen). Reunited with his ""Hugo"" co-star Kingsley gives a surprisingly understated performance while clearly savoring the chance to play the anti-Gandhi. When Tamirs plan fails leaving his rival clean-shaven but alive the film shifts from over-the-top caricature to fish-out-of-water comedy following Aladeen as he befriends an ultra-liberal American activist (Anna Faris) and discovers his place in the capitalist system. An unexpectedly poignant earlier scene -- the closest the film gets to Charlie-Chaplin-as-Hitler tenderly wooing a giant inflatable globe in ""The Great Dictator"" -- finds Aladeen standing unfulfilled before a wall of Polaroids depicting his many celebrity conquests. All he wants is someone to cuddle with. And so we are to believe that love with the unlikeliest of American women can turn the heart of a ruthless (but ultimately harmless) tyrant. It worked for Eddie Murphy in ""Coming to America"" though his anti-misogynist African prince arrived in search of a soul mate. In this case Faris has been transformed into an androgynous-looking feminist with hairy armpits and hidden breasts a stark contrast with the ""virgins"" who serve as one of the jobs biggest perks back home. No joke in ""The Dictator"" is funnier than the spontaneous one-liner Baron Cohen uttered after spilling an urn of ashes on Ryan Seacrest at the Academy Awards ""If someone asks what you are wearing tell them Kim Jong-il."" Between this and the infantile ""Ali G Indahouse"" (2002) its clear the star is most amusing when allowed to go off-script. In several cases scenes attempt to re-create the effect of putting Aladeen in front of an unsuspecting room as when his body double addresses the United Nations but the effect feels forced when hired actors do the reacting. Of course working with a more conventional script has its perks. Rather than orchestrating potentially embarrassing encounters with hidden cameras director Larry Charles (who helmed ""Borat"" and ""Bruno"" and may also have inspired Aladeens unruly beard) has a normal crew at his disposal turning his attention to such detail-oriented touches as Aladeens ornate uniform and palace. If ""The Dictator"" were opening in the imaginary Wadiya one could chalk up the films barely feature-length running time to the local censors but its troubling to think only 75 minutes of sufficiently funny material made the cut. Working with his usual co-scribes Baron Cohen must have been writing and rewriting right up until the end as many of the funniest lines have been looped delivered when the characters mouths are offcamera. For instance when Aladeen decrees America ""built by the blacks owned by the Chinese"" his insult plays over a shot of the New York skyline. Typically political correctness couldnt be farther from the filmmakers mind and yet what the pic most sorely lacks is the sort of humanist appeal Chaplin delivered at the close of ""The Great Dictator."" Baron Cohen may be ballsy but he doesnt have the nerve to make that kind of statement. That said his climactic speech on the lessons democracy could learn from despotism all but forgives the clumsy plotting that comes before.

Sacha Baron Cohens Dictator is a kinder gentler despot. For a decade Sacha Baron Cohen reveled in his role as the shockmeister of comedy. The characters he hatched on British TV--belligerent ""voice of da yoof"" Ali G Kazakh journalist Borat Sagdiyev and gay Austrian fashionista Brno--turned interviews into outrage sandbagging politicians with rudely pertinent questions and ordinary folks with his confrontational antics. From these characters came three films Ali G Indahouse (2002) and the prime mockumentaries Borat Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006) and Brno (2009). Borat was a worldwide hit Brno not so much indicating that audiences may have been feeling some kamikaze-comedy... To continue reading or Log-In Want the full story?

TWITTER Sacha Baron Cohen stars as a mad Middle Eastern autocrat in a film dedicated to the memory of Kim Jong-il. Sacha Baron Cohens shotgun blasts of scabrous humor hit more than they miss in The Dictator a self-consciously outrageous send-up of a mad-dog Middle Eastern autocrat who has his eyes and heart opened -- but not too much -- during a crazy visit to New York City. Rebounding from the disappointing Bruno Baron Cohen employs a comic range that ricochets between wicked political barbs and the lowest anatomical farce to often funny and occasionally hilarious effect. This is his most conventionally formatted narrative film without the pretense to catching people off-guard in real situations and while it will prove too extreme for a portion of the mainstream public Baron Cohens fans should generally welcome it to good box-office returns. PHOTOS Sacha Baron Cohens 5 Most Memorable Stunts Ali G Bruno General Aladeen Dedicated ""In loving memory of Kim Jong-il"" who occupied a place of comic honor in Team America World Police The Dictator can only have been made with two other late despots Muammar Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein especially in mind given the extent of ego and quantity of medals brandished by Admiral General Aladeen (Baron Cohen) of Wadiya. Instantly recognizable due to his substantial black beard Aladeen has been in power since the age of 7 sends even valued associates to the executioner for the merest perceived slight and has a wall of photographs of his celebrity sexual conquests the latest of whom is Megan Fox seen here making a hasty exit after a handsomely rewarded night between the sheets. VIDEO The Dictator Drops Kim Jong-II Ashes on Ryan Seacrest Like any notorious tyrant Aladeen needs at least one double to throw enemies off and even to be assassinated from time to time which is what gets him into trouble in the quick-firing script by Baron Cohen Alec Berg David Mandel and Jeff Schaffer. Aladeens resentful chief henchman Tamir (Ben Kingsley) finds a dimwitted shepherd whos a twin for his boss and on a trip to New York plans to pass the imposter off as the real thing for a speech at the United Nations. Tamir also will have the stand-in sign a new democratic constitution that will make him and various business associates notably a Chinese capitalist (Bobby Lee) very rich indeed. VIDEO The Dictator Trailer Sidelined and shorn of his facial shrubbery Aladeen is relegated to the hoi polloi for the first time in his life -- and in the United States no less. Much of the films most successful cultural humor stems from the almost unimaginable relationship between Aladeen who takes up the name of Allison Burgers and vegan/feminist/all-natural/way-too-politically correct manager of the Free Earth Collective Zoey (a brown-haired Anna Faris) whom he first encounters at an anti-Aladeen protest rally. Some truly riotous stuff stems from the interlopers startling verbal and sometimes physical abuse of store customers and staff and Zoey herself who sometimes gets upset at his all-purpose assault on every race color and creed but more often doesnt seem to know what the hell hes saying. STORY Sacha Baron Cohens Dictator Congratulates New French President Further fresh laughs stem from an unexpected reunion with his former chief rocket scientist and nuclear expert Nadal (Jason Mantzoukas) whom Aladeen thought he had executed but who is now among the refugees who cram the ""Death to Aladeen"" restaurant. The extremes of the films political black humor arrive in a diabolically clever scene in a tourist helicopter over Manhattan as an older American couple become increasingly alarmed overhearing these two suspicious-looking characters speaking some Middle Eastern language peppered with English phrases like 9/11 (theyre actually discussing a Porsche) Empire State Building and Statue of Liberty and making explosion noises. The far shores of outrageous bodily comedy are reached in two scenes at the Collective one in which Zoey has to teach her odd sort-of boyfriend how to masturbate and another featuring an emergency childbirth in which Aladeen after successfully seeing it through blithely asks ""Wheres the trash can? Its a girl."" VIDEO The Dictator Opening Scene The climax naturally involves the unavoidable encounter of the two Aladeens real and phony at the much-anticipated signing of the new democratic constitution. Larry Charles who guided both Borat and Bruno for Baron Cohen directs in an entirely unadorned straightforward manner that means only to serve the augment the comic exploits of the star though this time without the mockumentary aspects. The pair also continue to acknowledge when enough is enough; this one comes in at a tight 84 minutes just two minutes longer than its predecessors. Although The Dictator arrives at a happy ending after a fashion its more nuanced and intellectually satisfying than one expects and is preceded by a pointed political speech that will rile up pro- and anti-American establishment sentiment for different reasons. Musically the film is lively and diverse. Mostly shot in New York the films main overseas setting is the quasi-Moorish-styled Plaza de Espana in Sevilla Spain most famously used for the British officers club in Lawrence of Arabia.
