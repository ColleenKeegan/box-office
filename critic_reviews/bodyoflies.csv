The stakes are certainly high for Leonardo DiCaprios CIA operator on the ground in the Middle East whos fluent in Arabic culturally aware and covertly tracking terror suspects. What he doesnt need is his Washington handler (a porked-out yet somehow terrifyingly steely Russell Crowe) continuing to operate on a separate gung-ho agenda blithely impacting on his agents carefully cultivated trust with the Jordanian intelligence service (headed by a suave scene-stealing Mark Strong). Meanwhile as Manchester England buckles under the latest extremist outrage the information war is too important to lose.Adapted from a David Ignatius novel by The Departed writer William Monahan Scotts latest almost manages to square the circle of providing a cogent analysis of Bush IIs foreign policy failings while delivering a steady stream of multiplex-friendly bumps scrapes and explosions. Anchored by a hard-working persuasive DiCaprio its dense knotty stuff convincing (as ever with Sir Ridley) in its milieu and offering a deftly pointed study in contrasts between front-line personnel who really know the territory and powerful insular decision-makers far removed from the daily threat of assassination or abduction. Perhaps Scotts ever-restless shooting style doesnt quite differentiate between the peaks and troughs of the narrative yet its still an engrossing account of the intersection between process and ethics - shades of Jean-Pierre Melville? Docked a star unfortunately for a hokey final reel which somewhat reduces the intelligence quotient though the trenchant coda very nearly gets it back again.

"Review Body of Lies flat - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Body of Lies flatStory Highlights ""Body of Lies"" is CIA spy tale set in Middle East Leonardo DiCaprio is agent out to get terrorist; Russell Crowe is U.S.-based boss Two actors are barely together and neither is the disappointing story Next Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Three years after his Crusades epic ""Kingdom of Heaven"" director Ridley Scott returns to the shifting sands of the Middle East with ""Body of Lies."" Russell Crowe left and Leonardo DiCaprio share a rare scene together in Ridley Scotts ""Body of Lies."" Its a high-tech but earnest spy thriller which comes in roughly midway between the geopolitical pretensions of ""Syriana"" and the action-speaks-louder-than-words thrust of the ""Bourne"" movies. Yes there are a couple of chase scenes but Scott rarely shifts into high gear. You couldnt ask for a more alarming declaration of noble intent than the authentically scraggly black beard Leonardo DiCaprio sports as Roger Ferris CIA point man in Iraq Syria Jordan Dubai and other spots in the Levant. Ferris does shoot terrorists when pressed but hed sooner talk to them. You get the feeling this guy wouldnt pass certain folks patriot tests (he speaks fluent Arabic too) though he suffers mightily over the course of two hours. On the other hand Russell Crowe is relaxed and kicking up his heels as Ed Hoffman Rogers Langley supervisor and often enough ""the eye in the sky"" keeping his thumb on Ferris through more of those scarily efficient satellite tracking systems we keep seeing in movies this year. If Roger is a not-so-closet liberal Hoffmans definitely in the Cheney wing of the foreign policy spectrum. ""You need to decide which side of the cross youre on"" he warns Ferris. ""I need nailers not hangers."" Watch DiCaprio and Crowe offer their take on the film >> Scott fielded flak from some quarters for turning Somalis into cannon fodder in ""Black Hawk Down"" but steered a more politic course in ""Kingdom of Heaven."" In this film it is a given that there is a real jihadist threat to the West. The movie begins with extremists stepping up a terror campaign with bomb blasts across Europe. But screenwriter William Monahan who also wrote ""Kingdom of Heaven"" follows the David Ignatius novel in suggesting there is a smarter way to counter the radicals than pre-emptive strikes. (Monahan likes these murky waters; he won a screenwriting Oscar for ""The Departed."") Hoffmans bludgeoning shoot-first style is contrasted with the longer-term strategy of Jordanian intelligence chief Hani (British actor Mark Strong) who advocates bribery as a more effective tool than torture in pursuing the terrorist leader Al-Saleem. Strongs impressive silky-smooth performance makes this idealized figure more credible than he might have been. Hanis one requirement for cooperation with Ferris is that he never tell a lie -- which is a bit rich in the circumstances. He might as well ask a camel to tap-dance on its hind legs. Theres also a trite love story between Ferris and Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) a nurse whose main function is to prove that Arabs arent just people theyre also convenient pawns when it comes to engineering a good old-fashioned melodramatic ending. Scott milks the fear factor in much the same nightmare scenario Jason Bateman suffered in ""The Kingdom."" iReport.com Share your thoughts on Body of Lies Before it gets to the climax however ""Body of Lies"" offers a long elaborate setup -- involving ingenious computer hackery and a not very believable sting operation that creates a rival for Al-Saleem. Unfortunately there isnt enough in the way of a payoff. Crowe (in his fourth picture with Scott) and DiCaprio (his first) play well off each other but its a pity theyre on opposite sides of the globe for most of the action. Theres much too much satellite relay and not enough face time. You can see the difference when Ferris confronts Hoffman in a rare trip home. DiCaprios on Crowe like a boxer. ""Lose some weight you do this professionally"" he scolds as he tips him over in his chair. Its a surprising spontaneous moment and who knows if DiCaprio wasnt having some fun at his rather full-bodied co-stars expense? At any rate it feels like the truest exchange in the film. The rest boils down to an op-ed in desert fatigues. ""Body of Lies"" is rated R and runs 128 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

By Peter Rainer October 11 2008 Save for later Saved Leonardo DiCaprio in a scene from ""Body of Lies."" Francois Duhamel/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Ridley Scotts ""Body of Lies"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe pits the CIA against the jihadists and Ill say this much for it Its a lot easier to follow than ""Syriana."" But intelligibility is about the only thing this international thriller has going for it. It may open with a quote from W.H. Auden but thats just window-dressing (or salad dressing?). What follows is a high-priced potboiler that never comes to a boil.Scott and his screenwriter William (""The Departed"") Monahan never pass up the opportunity to stage a high-speed chase scene or blow something to smithereens which means that most of this movie resembles a trailer for itself. DiCaprios CIA operative Roger Ferris is an expert Arabist stationed in the Middle East whose specialty is infiltrating terrorist cells. His counterpart back at Langley is Crowes Ed Hoffman whose cellphone seems to be epoxied to his ear. Crowe wears geeky glasses and looks to have put on about 50 pounds for the role. Who wants to see Russell Crowe playing a schlub?Rogers latest mission is to collar an Islamist bigwig with the help of Jordanian intelligence chief Hani Salaam (tailored by Savile Row and played with panache by the British actor Mark Strong). Hani keeps reminding Roger that he doesnt tolerate deception and so of course we await an inevitable series of deceptions. This movie based on a novel by David Ignatius a veteran reporter who covered the CIA and the Middle East blows the lid off a well-kept secret of espionage. Are you sitting down for this? Spies lie. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Just in case we might feel a tad guilty watching all the skidding U-turns and kabooms Scott occasionally introduces a note of gravitas such as the moment when Hani informs Roger that when it comes to procuring information torture doesnt work. Take that you Americans Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Body of Lies Scott also works in a stupendously hackneyed romantic subplot involving a pretty nurse (Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani) who ministers to his many wounds. But what about the wounds inflicted on the audience? Grade C- (Rated R for strong violence including some torture and for language throughout.)

Roger Ferris played by Leonardo DiCaprio is the principled passionate one. Hes in the thick of things in Jordan risking his life to flush out a dangerous terrorist. His boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) is the loftily detached one. He sits at home in suburban Virginia laptop on lap studying imagery from spy satellites and from drone aircraft half a world away. The irony of the situation is that Ferris unable to distinguish friend from foe in a baffling culture sees his world no more clearly than Hoffman does. Yet theres another irony and its unintended. For all of Ferriss desperate struggles and for all the directors efforts to emulate the remarkable verisimilitude he achieved in ""Black Hawk Down"" his new film remains abstract and unaffecting. Its a study in semisimilitude more Google-Earthly than grounded in feelings. ENLARGE Leonardo DiCaprio as Roger Ferris in ""Body of Lies."" Associated Press/Warner Bros. The screenplay was adapted fairly freely by William Monahan from a novel by the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius. Mr. Monahan won an Oscar last year for his intricate adaptation of ""The Departed"" and there are plenty of intricacies here. Before hatching his own plot to catch the terrorist Ferris who is fluent in Arabic strikes up an uneasy alliance with Jordans chief of intelligence Hani a suave sophisticate elegant dresser and casual brute who may or may not be working both sides of the souk. Hani played by an English actor named Mark Strong is the movies most distinctive presence; he seems to know things that even the writer didnt know. When he assures Ferris that Jordan ""is a part of the world where friendship matters"" you know theres trouble ahead. Extremely violent trouble in fact relieved only by a tentative stab at romance between Ferris and a nurse Aisha who tends the first of his many wounds. Shes played appealingly by Golshifteh Farahani but cultural barriers stand in the way of anything serious growing out of their encounter even though his concern for her or his love or whatever it is sustains itself through thick thin and thinner. The movies drama lies mainly in the fraught relationship between Ferris and his devious boss Hoffman and the two performances are interesting but uninspired. Mr. DiCaprio stands up handsomely to lavish punishment as he did in ""Blood Diamond"" while Mr. Crowe shows up bulkily -- hes supposed to have put on 50 pounds for the part -- and does a lot of foxy-grandpa peering over the top of his glasses. May he slim down quickly and find a role his formidable talents deserve. Happy-Go-Lucky In the opening moments of Mike Leighs ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" a wonderful new movie with an astonishing comic performance by Sally Hawkins the camera follows the heroine Poppy as she bicycles through the streets of Central London smiling blissfully and waving hello to strangers. At first the sequence reminded me of the young Julie Christie as the buoyant Free Girl Liz striding along the sidewalks of Bradford in ""Billy Liar."" Theres a difference though. This girl isnt as free as shed like to be. After a while you start to notice that shes trying a bit too hard. Theres an edge to her happiness an unsettling brittleness. Its the first intimation of whats to come in a film that manages simultaneously and almost miraculously to celebrate Poppys vast joie de vivre while getting beneath her urgent need to feel good. ENLARGE Sally Hawkins in ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" Miramax Films I dont know how Mike Leigh does it. His working method is no secret -- weeks and months during which his actors investigate their roles through improvisation then a period of transition from improv to formal script to structured production. But how does he get to the complex beauty of his best films? I thought ""Topsy-Turvy"" was perfection a spirited evocation of the partnership of Gilbert and Sullivan plus a blithely definitive depiction of the artistic process. ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" is perfection too assuming you go along with its leisurely pace which I did quite happily. And Poppy is not the only perfect portrait in the film but shes the main one so lets start with her. She is first of all very young for her 30 years a compulsive cut-up who could pass for a daft party girl except that she cares deeply for the kids she teaches in primary school. Shes the least serious of several teachers in her life -- her flat mate and fellow teacher Zoe (Alexis Zegerman) her hilariously passionate flamenco teacher (Karina Fernandez) and her obsessive-compulsive misogynist of a driving instructor Scott who is played by Eddie Marsan with a wild anger thats fully equal to Sally Hawkinss epic sweetness. Scotts problem is that he cant shut up. At every turn intersection and roundabout he rages at the world in general and at Poppy in particular. Her problem is she wont grow up. She cant stop herself from laughing at his lunacy; she even laughs her compulsive little laugh in response to crippling pain in her lower back. Laughter has been her first line of defense against full adulthood. Yet anger in others brings out the best in her whether its a crisis involving a tortured classroom bully -- a pre-pubescent version of Scott -- or a curbside showdown in which Scott dissolves into infancy and Poppy embarks on a voyage of maturity knowing full well that theres no U-turning back. Find TV listings at LocateTV. ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" has happifications in abundance -- Poppys physical-therapy session with Ezra a huge and soulful osteopath; her visit with her pregnant sister Helen and Helens husband an overgrown infant addicted to videogames. The film is also graced with a mysterious encounter in an urban limbo between Poppy and a hulking homeless man; hes played masterfully by Stanley Townsend. The scene sounds like something out of Samuel Beckett with the man bellowing gibberish and Poppy drawn to him rather than afraid of him then listening intently and responding in kind -- two strangers talking in tongues until their souls touch. ""What am I doing?"" she asks herself but the answer is clear. Shes finding her own place in the world opening herself -- compulsively as always -- to life and risking growth without giving it a second thought.

Pictures On the trail of a terrorist CIA veteran Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe left) gives orders to Agent Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio). ABOUT THE MOVIEBody of Lies  1/2 (out of four)Stars Leonardo DiCaprio Russell Crowe Mark StrongDirector Ridley ScottDistributor Warner Bros.Rating R for strong violence including some torture and language throughoutRunning time 2 hours 8 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Body of Lies is a tautly paced well-acted espionage thriller with the requisite explosions and action sequences. Still it ends up leaving the viewer rather cold. It may have something to do with the glut of films about the war on terror and American involvement in the Middle East. This story though more involving than last years The Kingdom or Rendition doesnt consistently draw us in despite powerful performances by Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Strong and Russell Crowe and a screenplay by William Monahan (The Departed). PHOTO GALLERY Inside Body of Lies TRAILER Get on the case of Body of Lies Based on a 2007 novel by Washington Post journalist David Ignatius Body of Lies blends the believable and the far-fetched and comes off seeming too familiar. Wise beyond his years and fluent in Arabic CIA operative Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) gets a lead on an emerging terrorist bigwig operating in Jordan. In order to lure the terrorist leader he has to get the support of his superior CIA veteran Ed Hoffman (Crowe) who deals with Ferris from a laptop or over the phone from Virginia. The modus operandi and temperaments of the two intelligence agents are radically different which leads to some combative moments. These are two actors at the top of their games so their exchanges are a highlight. Ferris also must win the confidence of the affable but mysterious head of Jordanian intelligence Hani Salaam (Strong who also is on screens this week in RocknRolla). The film poses a recognizable spy-thriller dilemma How much can you trust your alleged allies? And in this case how much should you listen to your old-school boss thousands of miles away? When hes not navigating the complex world of global espionage Ferris takes time to fall for a Jordanian medical worker (Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani). The romantic subplot feels shoehorned in to keep the film from getting bogged down by chase scenes and firepower. Its as if some studio exec insisted on adding ""a little something for the ladies."" The plot occasionally becomes convoluted and murky but when it trains its focus on matters of treachery and intrigue Body of Lies is exciting and compelling.

"Body of Lies A waste of dramatic potential | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsBody of Lies A waste of dramatic potentialIf Ridley Scotts Body of Lies strikes out at multiplexes as it might despite the star power of Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe somebody should call up the studio and tell it that the cellphone is to blame.In this image released by Warner Bros. Leonardo DiCaprio is shown in a scene from Body of Lies.  (SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 10 2008 Body of Lies (out of 4)Starring Leonardo DiCaprio Russell Crowe Mark Strong and Golshifteh Farahani. Directed by Ridley Scott. 100 minutes. At major theatres. 14A If Ridley Scotts Body of Lies strikes out at multiplexes as it might despite the star power of Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe somebody should call up the studio and tell it that the cellphone is to blame.The ""war on terror"" thriller has indeed become a shop-worn genre as a dismal box-office body count attests. But Body of Lies demonstrates that greater tedium is to be found in the cellphone thriller possibly the most awful offshoot of the digital age.Here you have a movie where two of Hollywoods biggest stars play characters who are at odds with each other even though both work for the same team (the CIA in this case). On the rare occasions when they meet face-to-face Crowes natural pugnaciousness and DiCaprios newfound surliness combine to raise the room temperature.And yet they spend much of the movie arguing with each other over a cellphone. What a waste of dramatic potential and its all too common.Too many writers and directors lean on the cellular crutch to get their characters in and out of plot situations that in the past required only strong prose and clear vision. Crowe is CIA boss Ed Hoffman an overfed and arrogant bureaucrat who is based in Langley Va. with his wife and kids. Hes permanently and ludicrously attached to his headset and cellphone even when attending The Lion King with his family.He and his fellow CIA sluggos also snoop via satellite obtaining images so clear they can practically see sweat bead up on foreheads.Hoffman barks orders to DiCaprios Roger Ferris a field agent based in the Middle East who doesnt appear to need constant minding. Ferris speaks Arabic fluently and moves confidently through dangerous streets in Jordan Iraq and Syria.Hes willing to dodge bullets and bombs to rout terrorists even while one hand is figuratively tied behind his back via the phone link to America.The more Hoffman and Ferris connect electronically debating the merits of brute force vs. subterfuge the more the movie disconnects emotionally. Its like watching a video game and its a puzzle why Scott and screenwriter William Monahan (who adapted the novel Penetration by Washington Post writer David Ignatius) would choose to make their film more about technology than about human ingenuity. Early on in Body of Lies the point is made that Islamic terrorists including the bombing mastermind Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul) sought by the CIA in the film have switched to face-to-face communication because cellphones are too easy to track. The terrorism of the future is becoming more like the terrorism of the past. Yet the message seems lost on the Americans chasing them.Good things happen when people actually meet in the same room in this picture. As Jordanian intelligence chief Hani Salaam who views the CIA as both friend and enemy British actor Mark Strong cuts a dashing figure of duplicity. His scenes with Ferris as he demands total honesty while both men are engaging in deception mark the films dramatic highs. Strongs Middle Eastern accent is convincing but the same cant be said of Crowes attempt at Hoffmans Arkansas twang.Sparks are kindled in the films romantic subplot as Ferris woos comely Muslim nurse Aisha (Iranian actor Golshifteh Farahani) whom he meets at a clinic while being patched up from his latest near-fatal bomb encounter.The film wisely doesnt push cultural limits here - theres no physical contact to upset censors anywhere - but the love angle seems somewhat contrived especially when it leads Ferris into taking greater risks than usual.Rather than pursue the intrigue of the films one fresh idea the creation of a fake terror group to expose a real one Body of Lies shoots off in all directions with one dull action scene after another. And DiCaprios Ferris is cut from the same cloth as his mercenary character in Blood Diamond so much so that the two are practically interchangeable.Its hard to believe that the same director who helmed Black Hawk Down and Gladiator would settle for something this rote but Scott is definitely hit-and-miss - as such relatively recent misfires as A Good Year (also with Crowe) and Matchstick Men readily attest.Its equally difficult to conceive that Monahan the Oscar-winning screenwriter of The Departed (also with DiCaprio) would employ his pen to such minor invention.Body of Lies is more than anything a missed opportunity - or perhaps given its cellular phoniness a series of missed connections.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsA lesson learned from the lure of a high-yield return MayersYou can improve investment returns by shopping around but if an investment offers a rate that seems to be good to be true it probably is.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Body of Liesreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Body of Liesreviewed. Body of Liesreviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 10 2008 711 AM Glossy Torture Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio in Body of Lies. By Dana Stevens Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio in Body of Lies Body of Lies (Warner Bros.) the new Ridley Scott thriller about Iraq is virtually indistinguishable from The Kingdom or Rendition or any number of terrorist-themed recent thrillers in which interchangeable Arabs in kaffiyehs do horrible things to the luscious physiques of A-list Hollywood stars. Certain moments are contractually required to happen in a movie like this Camels will plod across the horizon as a womans voice wails in Arabic on the soundtrack. An expensive-looking aerial shot will soar over CIA headquarters in Langley Va. as a legend on the screens lower left spells out ""Langley Virginia."" Jeeps will explode in the desert. Leonardo DiCaprios forehead will perspire in extreme close-up. I will consult my watch. DiCaprio plays Roger Ferris a CIA operative in the Middle East who elevates himself from his fellow spies by actually liking the region and its residents. He speaks good Arabic pursues a flirtation with a half-Iranian half-Jordanian nurse named Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) and feels more at home dodging rabid dogs in the back alleys of Amman than he does at a cafe table overlooking the Mall. Ferris is an on-the-ground errand boy charged with carrying out the bidding of his gruff boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) who observes Ferris every move from his hypertechnologized office at CIA headquarters. Hoffman has theories about how best to wage the war on terror--theories that have a way of interfering with Ferris desire to continue living. As the two men team up to catch a reclusive Bin Laden-like figure named Al-Saleem (Alon Abutboul) Hoffmans arrogant my-way-or-the-highway style sabotages Ferris attempt to build an alliance with the Jordanian kings intelligence chief Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). Slate V The critics consensus on this weeks movie releases. A good hour into the film Ferris hatches a plan to create a fake terrorist network complete with staged bombings to draw Al-Saleem out of the shadows. He persuades Hoffman to hire a crackerjack computer hacker (Simon McBurney) to create Web sites and false bank accounts framing an innocent Dubai-based architect (whom Ferris vows to keep safe--good luck with that). This potentially clever plot twist is the only thing that sets Body of Lies apart from the generic terrorist-thriller format described above but it should have been introduced much earlier--by the time the fake-al-Qaida intrigue comes along were too sluggish to engage with the details. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. DiCaprio and Crowe two supposedly high-wattage movie stars are remarkably dull to watch together--perhaps because so many of their scenes together take place over the phone. (Occasionally Crowes character pops up in Jordan for no discernible reason other than a chance to see the two in the same room.) Crowes physique is not just a body of lies but a body of lard; he gained 50 pounds to play Hoffman a deskbound bureaucrat with a neglected suburban family and a mobile headset affixed to his skull. Mark Strong a British actor with some of the suave menace of Andy Garcia out-acts everyone in sight as the impeccably dressed Jordanian spy Hani Salaam. Hanis intricate ruthlessly enforced code of honor is all the more effective because he truly believes in it. By contrast Crowes character is a proudly unrepentant professional liar and DiCaprios is an ambivalent and conflicted one. Even DiCaprios romantic interest Aisha is lying deceiving her family and herself about the true nature of her mysterious suitors job. But the script by William Monahan (who also wrote The Departed) never takes the time to tease out the moral distinctions that would make these differences mean something. The minute anyone sits down to talk up pops another jihadi with a rocket launcher. Now that the war-on-terror action film has become as de rigueur as the Cold War one used to be the Geneva Conventions should be revised to include a moratorium on the portrayal of torture in Hollywood (not that the Gonzales memos couldnt have found a way around that too). In some insidious way the seamless incorporation of torture scenes into a standard spy story shifts the viewers focus from the political to the personal from ""Never again"" to ""No Not Leos fingers"" Nothing against those attractive and well-insured digits but Im still waiting for the war-on-terror thriller that has more on its mind than the threat al-Qaida poses to movie stars.

""Body of Lies"" has almost everything - a top-notch director (Ridley Scott) major stars (Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe) and a compelling subject counterterrorist espionage in the Middle East. The locations are exotic and dangerous and theyre presented with a feeling for the customs and behaviors of the people who live there. Yet all that can barely make up for the one thing ""Body of Lies"" lacks a story that makes it feel personal. DiCaprio as the American operative on the ground cares about his job but for at least two-thirds of the movie nothing is on the line for him. The stakes are low and the direct consequences to him are minor. OK so he cares. OK so he sounds nervous and curses at his boss over a cell phone when things go bad. But his point of view remains distant and so does the audience. This makes for a movie experience in which the viewer sits patiently for about 45 minutes waiting for the story to kick in only to realize oh. So this is it. DiCaprio yelling into a cell phone. Russell Crowe as his chubby complacent boss talking back calmly. And a few drum machines going to make it seem like somethings happening that matters. This should have been a nail-biter. Instead it plays like a slightly muddled intellectual exercise illustrated by a few explosions. Once that realization settles in and the accompanying mild despair is overcome there are things to appreciate. Based on a novel by David Ignatius the movie has two fairly compelling ideas that it keeps hammering over and over. The first is that the agents on the ground know a lot more than their comfortable superiors in Washington. The second is that the Washington bureaucrats motivated by political concerns give orders that are destructive in human terms and counterproductive in strategic terms. Theyre screwing up the war on terror because they dont know anything and they dont care. As Hoffman the Washington-based boss Crowe is the embodiment of everything the movie holds in contempt. On the surface hes mild and rumpled a middle-class father living with his family in a cozy suburb someone anybody might identify as a nice guy. But as he loads the groceries into the hatchback hes talking into his headset giving orders that cut the legs out from under allies and result in the deaths of innocent people. He is some variety of fanatic perhaps a particularly American variety one whose faith in his own virtue is so complete that he could commit any atrocity with a clear conscience. The film is arranged as a series of disparate missions. If theres an overarching story it has to do with the CIAs pursuit of a high-ranking terrorist a pursuit aided by a Jordanian intelligence minister. Mark Strong plays the Jordanian official and if you want to see an actor lift up a movie just by walking onto the screen check out Strongs performance. Tall impeccably dressed and with the self-command of a lord Strong dominates the handful of scenes hes in. Hes a character of conscience and refinement set up in contrast to his slovenly American counterpart (Crowe). In its overall outlook ""Body of Lies"" is ideologically jumbled but as a statement from our time maybe thats appropriate. Even so the movie is best in its little details Ferris (DiCaprio) survives a terrorist bombing but has hard white bits of matter stuck in his arms that have to be removed. ""Bone fragments"" the doctor says. ""Dont worry not yours."" DiCaprio is a vital engaging leading man - the lightweight pretty boy of his ""Titanic"" days is long gone - but throughout ""Body of Lies"" hes forced to do what Scott keeps doing with the camera the editing and the soundtrack He pushes. He tries to create drama through sheer intensity but its like stirring an empty pot. Theres nothing there. -- Advisory This film contains strong language and graphic violence.

"Body of Lies | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; body-of-lies ) Body of Lies (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Body of Lies is an adult thriller with such a high narrative density that even a brief trip to the restroom may result in key plot points being lost. The film is the antithesis of a slick superficial feature like Eagle Eye. It both demands and rewards thought. It engages the mind instead of punishing those who use it for reasoning. Body of Lies neither panders nor condescends. It involves current events and has a political viewpoint but it overplays neither. And while the movie is very much story-driven it doesnt lose sight of the characters along the way. Its smart and complex in the same way that films like Syriana and The Departed are smart and complex. Ridley Scott isnt afraid to take risks and he has built up enough Hollywood credibility to allow him to make the film he wants. Body of Lies isnt going to find much favor among the teenage crowd but it is the kind of motion picture that older more sophisticated viewers hunger for. Despite the convoluted nature of the storyline and the way events jump from one location to another Body of Lies is consistently well paced and as it moves past the 60 minute mark into its second hour it begins to exhibit more of what we expect from a thriller tension and suspense. Rather than attempting to dissect the plot in any detail the best approach is to lay the groundwork. Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) are a CIA team. Ferris is the field guy; he has all the contacts and knows the layout. He can move with ease from Iraq to Jordan to Syria. He can tell that a nurse working in Amman is from Iran based on her accent. Hoffman is his desk-bound boss who sits like a spider at the center of a web in Langley watching Ferris from above via real-time satellite images. Its the ultimate Big Brother scenario. Ferris and Hoffmans latest operation has them going after an Osama Bin Laden clone Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). To do this they must partner with the head of Jordans Intelligence Agency Hani (Mark Strong). But Hani is as smart and manipulative as any CIA director and Ferris finds himself trapped between orders from Hoffman and the Jordanians single directive Do not lie to me. Body of Lies crisscrosses the globe with scenes taking place in no less than a half-dozen countries including the United States England Holland Iraq Jordan and Syria. While the globe-trotting may be James Bond-like the activities of the spies are not. Theres nothing suave or dignified in the ways these characters interact. The do not take their martinis shaken (not stirred) - they gulp down the vodka in one mouthful and get on with the job. For the most part the tone is one of seriousness but Scott allows for one scene of levity and a little light romance. Visually the film is interesting in the way it uses satellite images to present a wider birds eye view of the action. The screenwriter is William Monahan (adapting from a novel by David Ignatius) who is developing a reputation as someone whose scripts are multifaceted and detailed. He took the basics of Infernal Affairs and fleshed them out for The Departed. And his original storyline for Kingdom of Heaven was far more thought-provoking than the neutered version that reached screens (as anyone who has seen the Directors Cut will testify). The screenplay for Body of Lies is in the same league. Its refreshing to watch a movie where the viewer is not always two steps ahead of the characters. In essence the movie has a deceptively simple theme that is italicized by an opening quote by W.H. Auden ""Those to whom evil is done Do evil in return."" Its about the slippery slope that exists when those with the best intentions begin to emulate the tactics of the enemy in order to defeat them. Body of Lies illustrates this in ways that are neither obvious nor expected. The most chilling thing about the film may be its verisimilitude. Where Eagle Eye exists only in the realm of science fiction its possible that things like those depicted in Body of Lies are happening now in the real world. Rarely has the question of whether the end justifies the means been brought to the fore in such a forceful and brutal manner. There is a scene late in the movie that will distress some viewers. Seen objectively its far less graphic than what one might expect from a horror movie. Scott does not dwell lovingly on the violence but he makes it perfectly clear whats going on. So why is this so more unsettling than the routine eviscerations depicted in the Saws and Hostels? Because the characters in this film seem like real people not fodder to feed a serial killer. Body of Lies takes the time to flesh out Ferris and Hoffman. The latter is depicted talking to his man-on-the-ground while spending time with his family. The latter is allowed to romance the nurse who treats him for rabies. I dont think either Leonardo DiCaprio or Russell Crowe will be in line for an acting nomination as a result of their work here. Although they give strong performances theres nothing showy about them. These portrayals are straightforward and convincing; theres no mugging for the camera. Crowe exhibits his versatility by playing a sleazy obnoxious man who pushes around people like chess pieces. DiCaprio builds upon his work in The Departed and Blood Diamond. They are ably assisted by Mark Strong whose beguiling interpretation of Hani may be the best piece of acting the movie has to offer. He gives the impression of how Satan may have convinced Eve to partake in the Garden of Eden. Numerous recent movies have used the current unstable geopolitical situation as a backdrop. Few have done it as effectively as Body of Lies and almost none are as free of preaching. Scott acknowledges the gulf of moral ambiguity that exists for those working in the intelligence field and pursues it to its natural conclusion. For those who care about there being more to a thriller than pointless car chases and over-edited fight sequences Body of Lies offers a satisfying dose of truth.

Stars Leonardo DiCaprio Russell Crowe Body of Lies FridayOctober 10 A CIA operative tries to infiltrate a terrorist cell but he soon begins to wonder about the loyalties of those who are giving the orders. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio Russell Crowe (Warner Bros.) Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Body of Lies is a riddle wrapped in an enigma served with a side of mystery meat. Its very watchable with some entertaining action beats kind of a Syriania as scripted by Tom Clancy a The Kingdom with a little less C.S.I -- heavy on the tech snappy in the dialogue.But the showy dialogue -- and a scenery-chewing turn by Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead -- forces Ridley Scotts latest foray into the morass of the Middle East to straddle that line between ""not bad"" and ""not all that either."" DiCaprio is Roger Ferris an Arabic-speaking C.I.A. field agent at home in Iraq or Turkey the United Arab Emirates or Amman Jordan. Hes chasing this phantom terrorist Al-Saleem. Hes constantly on the phone with his portly desk-jockey boss the D.C.-based field chief played with a cagey drawl by Russell Crowe. Ferris goes undercover works agents tries to ""turn"" terrorists always with Ed Hoffman (Crowe) watching in by spy plane listening in by phone.They have shouting matches disagreements over strategy largely over issues of trust or control. And maybe cell phone bills. ""Youve gotta decide which sidea the cross youre on"" drawls Ed. ""I need nailers. Not hangers.""Eds interference his running of ""side operations"" behind Rogers back is dangerous. But it turns deadly when he puts Ferris in bed with the deadly-efficient Jordanian secret police led by the dapper scary-intense Hani. Mark Strong does a silky menacing Armand Assante impersonation in playing this master counter-terrorist a man who insists on human assets not high-tech and man who demands that you never ever ever lie to him.The bad guys are fighting as Hoffman lectures ""men from the future"" -- that is us. And by going low-tech not using computers or cell phones to communicate for instance they are staying one step ahead of the C.I.A. But Ferris despite his differences with Hoffman envisions a trap.Youve guessed that theres going to be a betrayal a ""side operation"" and a lie. Youve guessed that since its a Leo movie therell be a love interest here an Iranian-Jordanian nurse (Golshifteh Farahan).(c) And if youve noticed that the script was by William ""The Departed"" Monahan you know that all this lip service about men from the past avoiding cell phones is just that lip service. Monahan is Mr. Cell-Phone-as-Plot-Device. Theyre a constant here used to set up meets set off bombs bicker with bosses and badger divorce lawyers in the middle of an anti-terror operation. Its not exactly a lazy prop though you would hope Monahan is getting some sort of Sprint kickback for all the cell-plugging hes doing in his scripts.DiCaprios performance is amped-up in the extreme here lots of yelling into a phone chewing out subordinates bobbing his head or worse raising his eyebrows with each line. Scotts choppy editing style means that every shot is a repeat performance with little flow between cuts. Leo works himself into a tizzy then ""ACTION"" and thats what we see.Body of Lies adapted from a David Ignatius novel plays like a beach book a decent genre page-turner. We liked Syriana and The Kingdom right? We stay with this sand-caked beach novel even if we pretty much know whats on that last page half-way through.

Body of Lies (R) Warner Bros. (126 min.) Directed by Ridley Scott. With Leonardo DiCaprio Russell Crowe. Now playing in New Jersey. TWO AND A HALF STARS Ridley Scott has long been famed for having the best ""eye"" in the business. But for the last decade its his vision thats been questionable. Certainly ""Gladiator"" was a big deserved hit; ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Matchstick Men"" were muddled yet had moments. But ""Kingdom of Heaven"" was a dreary epic; ""A Good Year"" felt like 12 long months. And what in the end was all the fuss and fury of ""American Gangster"" for? His storytelling falters again in ""Body of Lies."" Its another war-on-terror movie this time hopping around the Middle East as American and Jordanian spies share secrets trade lies and shape the truth to their advantage. Its a little bit of ""Syriana"" a lot of ""Traitor"" -- and an awful lot of scenes of people cursing into cell phones. Leonardo DiCaprio is the agent on the ground and hes what the British used to call an Arabist -- someone well versed in and respectful of the regions cultures and traditions. Still hes not above assassinating an unarmed man when he needs to -- even one of his own. Russell Crowe meanwhile is his boss back in Washington -- one of those pale pudgy bureaucrats who manage to get in muck up to their elbows without ever getting their fingernails dirty. In the movies coldest sequences he spies on people from thousands of miles away via spy planes -- then orders their destruction. Its a strong simple conflict -- the soldier in the trenches vs. the armchair general -- and screenwriter William Monahan adds to it. Like his script for ""The Departed"" this is a movie about betrayal -- with double and triple agents manufactured incidents and a hero who couldnt find the truth with a map and a GPS device. DiCaprio revisits some of the pained intensity he brought to a similar part as an undercover agent in ""The Departed"" and Crowe seems to have a great deal of fun padding around in comfortable clothes and an equally oversized Southern accent. And Scotts eye -- particularly when he turns it on scenes of high-tech surveillance -- is as sharp as ever. Yet the film still falters. Part of that is simple geography -- with DiCaprio in Amman Jordan and Crowe in Langley Va. most of their scenes are played over the phone hardly the most conducive approach to nail-biting suspense. But much of it is the drama itself or the lack of it. Because -- apart from an unconvincing romance between DiCaprio and a devout Muslim nurse -- the only real story here is supposedly DiCaprios transformation from idealist to cynic. Its the ""High Noon""/ ""Dirty Harry"" template in which the lone good guy does his job because no one else will but then walks away from a system he can no longer support. The only problem with that is were never sure of when DiCaprio crosses that line -- or that he hasnt in fact crossed it before the movie even began. We know hes supervised torture sessions; weve watched him kill an unarmed man. So whats the turning point for him? And why? While DiCaprio does a good job of appearing genuinely anguished by his ruthless double-dealing in the end its hard to sympathize. Did he think he was joining the Peace Corps? Hes a career agent working for the CIA on anti-terrorist initiatives in the Middle East; what on earth did he think the job was going to involve? As usual Scotts movie looks good -- beautiful photography clean editing action sequences that barrel along like freight trains. He knows how to keep an audience watching. But what precisely does he want us to see and why did he feel compelled to show it? Those are questions Scott seems less sure of every day. Rating note The film contains gory violence torture brief nudity and strong language. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

As embodied by Russell Crowe - who reportedly gained 50 pounds for what amounts to an unofficial Bill Clinton impression as head of the agencys Mideast desk - the CIA is constantly double-crossing its allies and even its employees. Those betrayed include the agencys improbably idealistic No. 1 agent in the area. Because hes played by the top-billed Leonardo DiCaprio its a pretty good assumption hes going to survive with little lasting damage except possibly a pair of missing fingernails. This is more than you can say for some of the people he works with in a movie filled with stuff blowing up at very regular intervals. Call it terrorist porn or ""Syriana"" for dummies. For all the convolutions in the script by William Monahan (""The Departed"") based on a novel by David Ignatius the story is really quite simple if not downright simple-minded. To draw an Islamic terrorist (Alon Aboutboul) responsible for a string of European bombings out of hiding DiCaprios Roger Ferris creates a fake terrorist cell to stage a fake bombing of an American target. This requires framing an innocent Saudi architect as the groups leader and deceiving Jordans courtly intelligence chief (an entertaining Mark Strong) who has been assisting the none-too-trustworthy Americans to track the terrorist. When Roger starts dating a Palestinian nurse (Golshifteh Farahani) who pulls bone fragments (not his) out of Rogers wounds her presence fairly screams ""hostage."" If Roger is as smart as were told he is then why does he constantly seem to be surprised by the CIAs double dealings? Why does he leave people open to grave danger? The still-boyish DiCaprio who sports a North Carolina accent and a beard basically lacks the gravitas for the role just as he did in the similarly outraged ""Blood Diamond."" Theres a fine line between anger and petulance. Crowe seems to be having a fine old time in what amounts to a supporting role as Ed Hoffman chewing scenery and food as he literally phones in most of his performance via a cellular. Often hes watching Roger in action on a big-screen TV which is about as exciting for audiences as the most eyeball-glazing visual cliche of 21st-century thrillers money being transferred on a computer. ""Body of Lies"" is being hailed in some quarters as a ""new"" kind of war thriller. While this glitzy production may attract audiences suffering from battle fatigue its nothing of the sort. Aside from a nifty new way to avoid surveillance in the middle of the desert theres nothing here we havent seen in many other movies - including ""Spy Game"" directed by Scotts brother Tony before 9/11. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next DAVIDS DAD AT IT AGAIN Read Next DAVIDS DAD AT IT AGAIN Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 57666 How Hillary blew her big moment 26682 Malia Obama skipped the DNC for Lollapalooza 22521 Cop in bikini tackles bad guy Now On Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary Jill and Joe Biden stop traffic on Fifth Avenue Ex-Focus Features CEO thanks company for firing him SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Demmes Dazzler The directors Rachel Getting Married spins gold out of the very bleak. Plus Body of Lies launches a new star. _ By David Edelstein Published Oct 6 2008 ShareThis (Photo Bob Vergara/Courtesy of Sony Picture Classics) Early in Jonathan Demmes heartrending Rachel Getting Married fresh-out-of-rehab Kym (Anne Hathaway) rises to toast her older sister Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt) at the rehearsal dinner and we know from her first wayward sentences that shes going to make a fool of herself. Its a familiar setup nowadays The exhibitionist opens his or her mouth toads leap out and the camera takes in the wreckage unblinking while we squirm or snicker or both. In another recent nuptials film Noah Baumbachs Margot at the Wedding nearly every encounter is engineered for us to cringe at the characters monstrous egotism. But as Kym babbles with forced good cheer about making amends and the AA Fourth Step (Step step-ball-change still waiting for the change part) and the guests go stone-faced something unusual happens. We start to feel emotions other than discomfort. For Demme and first-time screenwriter Jenny Lumet Kyms humiliation isnt an end in itself. We stay with her through the embarrassment and come out the other side. And we see all at once that this unstable self-centered child-woman longs to make things right even if she doesnt begin to know howeven if things can never be made right. The opening isnt promisingor rather the promise is the movie will be grueling. As Kym waits outside the rehab facility for her dad to drive her to her familys Connecticut house a spiteful patient hisses something about her having killed someone in a car; a few scenes later at home she gingerly opens the door of whats clearly a little boys room and the bed is perfectly made and the toys too neatly in place. Uh-oh another dead-kid movie. But Declan Quinns camera follows Kym into that room from an odd angledown low looking up instead of over her shoulder (as in a Gothic horror film). The obliqueness and tremulousness of the shot is a mercy. Demme is a father (his teenage son Brooklyn plays guitar in the onscreen wedding band) and hes too sensitiveby which I mean both principled and vulnerableto turn the dead-child device into a dramaturgical striptease. The tragedy is always therethe movie fairly shivers with a sense of loss. But there are so many countervailing currents that it never becomes a dirge. Its messy and alive teeming with wonderful performers acting their hearts out. BACKSTORY The press might be focusing on Anne Hathaway (for obvious reasons) but what about the actress who plays Rachels title character? Mad Men fans will recognize Rosemary DeWitt who was Don Drapers beatnik lover illustrator Midge Daniels in the shows first season. Yes the one who pushed her TV out the window and uttered one of the series best lines I dont make plans and I dont do breakfast. (In the end she chose pot and Miles Davis over Paris with Draper. Too bad for him.) You can see more of DeWitt when she stars alongside Toni Collette in Showtimes upcoming drama The United States of Tara written by Junos Diablo Cody. That includes Hathaway who is stunningly vivid. She has a habit of telegraphing her characters emotions but this time her mannerisms are in sync with the role. Kym is a former child model whose mood swings prompt her anxious father Paul (the superb Bill Irwin) to rush in and coddle her; it makes sense for the character to draw attention to herself by pulling faces. And really what a face to pull. The dark eyes the heavy mouth the teeth like bowling pins Everything but the tidy ski-slope nose is way oversize as if her head never grew into her features. The bratty Kym is impossible to ignore even when shes only smoking and glowering. This is Rosemarie DeWitts first big movie role and although she doesnt resemble Hathaway she meshes with her. Rachel is at long last fed up with being upstaged and when she reacts to her sister we react to (and like) her. In the midst of a public screaming match shed ordinarily never win Rachel pulls out a trump cardshe announces shes pregnant. As relatives clamor around Kym cries Thats so unfair The line is so childishly pure in its resentment that it could be a speech balloon in a Peanuts strip. In Demmes last personal fiction film The Truth About Charlie (Im not counting his Manchurian Candidate remake) the overflowing humanismmulticultural musicians everywhere you looked and the camera made you lookoverwhelmed the narrative. Demme was starting to seem fatuously humanistic. But in Rachel Getting Married his generous impulses pay off. He creates a Robert Altmanlike texture hectic but focused. The 12-step meetings Kym attends dont go on a beat too longjust long enough to register all the troubled lived-in faces. This bleak family drama unfolds in a larger extended family in which barriers have dissolved. Especially racial barriers Pauls second wife (Anna Deavere Smith) is African-American and so is Rachels fiance (Tunde Adebimpe the lead singer of TV on the Radio). Late in the film theres a lengthy musical sequence featuring Arabic musicians who worked on Demmes Jimmy Carter documentary as well as past collaborators Robyn Hitchcock and Sister Carol East. Ive heard people say Demmes use of music is self-indulgent. Well its indulgent but the self has nothing to do with it. Shakespeares comedies end with songs and dances (which most directors cut). Demme must have felt he needed the celebratory communal interlude to offset the central story which is bleak and ragged and unfinished. 1 2 Next Share this story...

(Duhamel/AP) Joe Neumaier Thursday October 9 2008 1201 PM In political thrillers this is the era of high-tech overload. Surveillance from the sky clicking computer codes and jabbering about ""bad intel"" and ""good intel"" are now SOP in movies like this (see ""Traitor"" ""Eagle Eye"" even ""Burn After Reading"" for other recent file sharers). Art may be imitating life but it sure makes for dull movies. ""Body of Lies"" is the latest example of what a crutch this has become - show grainy satellite images cut to a chase in a crowded bazaar discuss ""intel."" Repeat.RELATED DICAPRIO READY TO SETTLE DOWN Its like torture though ""Body of Lies"" has nothing to spill. Based on a novel by David Ignatius and adapted by William Monahan (""The Departed"") Ridley Scotts movie aims to be up-to-the-moment - yet feels same-old same-old. It isnt helped by a rote rogues gallery of Middle East villains Leonardo DiCaprio in frantic-hunted mode (once again) and Russell Crowe being paunchy.DiCaprios agent Roger Ferris is a fuzzy-bearded CIA operative working the angles in various countries to nab a terrorist leader. Arriving in Jordan he and his superior Ed Hoffman (Crowe) - who guides his operatives moves while shambling around his home in the D.C. suburbs - come up with a double-twist sting though it will endanger innocents and target Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani) a nurse in Amman who Ferris has fallen for. Backed by a Jordanian spy chief (Mark Strong) Ferris sets the pieces in order - although with the CIA monitoring his every move each decision he makes has unexpected results. With so much hustle and bustle Crowe and DiCaprio unsurprisingly take different paths to find a character. Crowe goes the schlubby-genius route so as Hoffman mutters high-level security info into a hands-free cell hes attending Little League games or helping his young son go to the toilet. When Hoffman arrives for face-to-face meetings the same wrinkled linen suit always covers his big belly. He sounds like Beau Bridges and looks like Roy Clark. This worked better for Crowe in ""The Insider.""DiCaprio for his part pumps up the manic energy yet comes off as too high-strung. The guy can do a lot of things as an actor but looking like he has the weight of the free world on his shoulders isnt one of them. Scott whose style the last 20 years has been glossy and urgent puts his faith in confusion and a belief that enough techno-wow will keep people from seeing good actors being wasted and that a second-rate Robert Ludlum tale has just gotten a cheap upgrade.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

P Warner Brothers Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Body of Lies"" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint In the Shiite Islamic tradition the concept of taqiyya refers to permissible lies told by believers to shield themselves from persecution. In the espionage thriller ""Body of Lies"" truth and trust are the first casualties in the battle between the CIA and Al-Qaida terrorists. (view movie showtimes) The film describes a post-9/11 world where U.S. and Jordanian governments nominally anti-terrorist allies distrust each other and refuse to share information. Field agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) doesnt know what clandestine operations his CIA superior Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) is running from Washington. Jordanian intelligence chief Hani Salaam (Mark Strong) insists on Ferris unconditional honesty while shrouding his own dealings in mystery. When Ferris concludes that the only way to flush out the reclusive terrorist Suleiman is to dupe his own Arab partners and frame an innocent man the shaky scaffolding of confidence they rely on comes apart endangering Ferris and those closest to him. The dubious morality of permissible lies in wartime backfires in every direction killing or discrediting those who circulate them. Director Ridley Scott (""Black Hawk Down"" ""American Gangster"") films the action with atmospheric grit. The visuals are so thick with chin stubble dirt cigarette smoke and sweat that youll want to shower with a cake of Lava afterward. And Scott could edit a game of hopscotch so that it crackles with nervous tension; his work here with chases through squalid Third World slums high-caliber combat scenes and helicopter attacks is relentlessly exciting. Unfortunately weve seen variations on this story a dozen times. The muddled nature of a conflict where ones enemies are almost indistinguishable from ones friends hobbled ""The Kingdom"" ""Traitor"" ""Rendition"" and ""Lions for Lambs"" and ""Body of Lies"" fares no better. The script by William Monaghan is hamstrung between the obligation to educate audiences and the impulse to entertain. The crackling dialogue and vibrant characters Monaghan created for ""The Departed"" are nowhere to be seen. BODY OF LIES  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for strong violence including some torture and for language throughout. DiCaprio and Crowe share only a few scenes together disappointing viewers who hoped for a battle royal between two of our finest actors. DiCaprio is compellingly brave and idealistic as the agent who must compromise his morals to carry out his mission. He falters only in a romantic subplot with an Arab nurse a relationship that feels tacked-on and unpersuasive. Crowe delivers a fussy performance as a slippery main-office spymaster who drives his kids to their soccer matches while monitoring the Mideast by cell phone. But its supporting actor Strong who makes the biggest impression. As the suave Jordanian intelligence czar he radiates supreme self-confidence and unbending willpower. The ethical and cultural conflicts among the three men are more compelling than the chase after bombing mastermind Suleiman. The real story here isnt the hunt for a terrorist but the foreign policy challenges between nations with not much in common but an enemy.

"Body of Lies (R) 1/2 | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Body of Lies (R) 1/2 Body of Lies comes on like gangbusters but its not exactly memorable. Russell Crowe and Leonardo Dicaprio in Warner Bros. Pictures suspense thriller ""Body of Lies."" Share Print Save to your profile Rene Rodriguez Miami Herald The title Body of Lies sounds like something you might catch on Cinemax on a late weekend night -- a movie starring Heather Locklear as the sultry defendant in a scandalous murder trial. Its a generic clunky title. The movie isnt quite as disposable but its not exactly memorable either. It comes on like gangbusters though. Director Ridley Scott (GladiatorBlack Hawk Down) seizes your attention from the get-go plunging us into the terrifying world of Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) a CIA operative who bounces around Middle East hotspots either trying to infiltrate terrorist cells or convincing (or bribing) someone on the inside to turn informant. Ferris is fluent in Arabic has a knack for getting people to trust him and does not hesitate to use violence -- when necessary. His boss at Langley headquarters is Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) a driven agency man entirely focused on maintaining the constant vigilance essential to combating the terror threat. Hoffmans mantra is that no one is innocent in this [war] a credo that allows him to remain emotionally detached from the collateral damage the agencys investigations often wreak. Ferris tries to do the same but being on the front line developing personal connections with the people hes manipulating for the sake of doing his job makes it harder to ignore ones conscience. DiCaprio who has played so many tormented angst-ridden characters his brow has developed a permanent crease makes for a sympathetic engaging protagonist and as the callous Hoffman Crowe (who gained 50 pounds for the role) brings a layer of subtle humor to a man whose obsession with his job leaves room for little else in his life. When we see him participating in the lives of his wife and daughter he seems to be patronizing them more than anything else. The two actors have a couple of scenes together but for much of the movie they talk to each other via telephone. Scott whose trademark larger-than-life visual style can sometimes overshadow his actors tones down the slick images (much like he did in his last picture American Gangster) to keep the viewers focus on the complex plot which centers on Ferris hunt for an elusive terrorist responsible for the bombing of a shopping center in Amsterdam. Written by William Monahan (The Departed) from the novel by David Ignatius Body of Lies has the feel of a project thats been impeccably researched and fact-checked. The film does a good job of conveying the daunting task U.S. overseas operatives must deal with in order to achieve their goal. But theres also something vaguely schematic about the way the story plays out right down to the improbable ending which cops out in a hugely disappointing fashion. Body of Lies has its share of exciting moments -- Scott remains a master at directing physical action -- and it certainly couldnt be more timely. But its also a safe and predictable movie about a subject that is neither. Cast Leonardo DiCaprio Russell Crowe Mark Strong Golshifteh Farahani Oscar Isaac Alon Abutbul. Director Ridley Scott. Screenwriter William Monahan. Based on the novel by David Ignatius. Producers Ridley Scott Donald De Line. A Warner Bros. release. Running time 120 minutes.

Image 1of/1 CaptionClose Image 1 of 1 CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) heads up a mission to snare Al-Saleem the al-Qaida mastermind behind a series of attacks in Europe. CIA agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) heads up a mission to snare Al-Saleem the al-Qaida mastermind behind a series of attacks in Europe. Photo FRANCOIS DUHAMEL WARNER BROS. Body of Lies 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Some 13 years ago Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe showed off their fastest reflexes and iffiest drawls in The Quick and the Dead Sam Raimis fun little cheeseball of a Western. DiCaprio all of 21 had not yet made Titanic; Crowe was two years shy of L.A. Confidential. Both were younger then and prettier. Hair floppier skin smoother personae less fixed in the public consciousness. And in the intervening years both actors have achieved A-list success and then rebelled reshaping themselves (often literally in Crowes case) as no-guff masculine leads whove shrugged off all remnants of vanity. Only the iffy drawls remain in Body of Lies an engrossing brainy spy thriller that chases around the Middle East with CIA agent Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) while Ed Hoffman (Crowe) his lumpen Langley puppet master watches via satellite. Their mission to snare Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul) the al-Qaida mastermind behind a recent spate of attacks in Europe. Hoping to infiltrate a safehouse and locate Al-Saleem Ferris reaches out to the head of Jordanian intelligence (Mark Strong magnificent and sleek). On this basic premise builds a complicated story plied with onion layers of perspective and cunning. Hoffman watches Ferris who watches Jordanian agents who watch terrorists who watch video communiques from their own distant puppet master. And of course we watch everything our attention steered by the reigning Gepetto of them all director Ridley Scott. No one is more brazenly manipulated in this cat-and-mouse affair than the audience itself but thats the thrill of it. I dont know about you but when I walk into an espionage movie shot through with shifting allegiances I expect to be played like a violin. And so I was. Based on the novel by David Ignatius Body of Lies has more on its mind than entertainment. Theres a message in there nestled alongside the corkscrew plot maneuvers that suggests the hell of war is nastier when its waged from a distance. Ferris is the grunt on the ground a fluent Arabic speaker whos soft on a local gal (Golshifteh Farahani) and tries to understand the Muslim world from the inside out. Hoffman meanwhile controls the entire operation from his plump domestic vantage point in suburban D.C. As he puts his kids to bed drops his kids at school or watches his kids play soccer Ferris is pulling someone elses bone fragments out of his forearm. ""Aint nobody innocent"" Hoffman claims but thats easy for him to say He observes the carnage from a cozy orbit. When Ferris tells him hes ""a million (bleeping) miles away"" hes only hyperbolizing by a few measly zeroes. Yet most of the time despite the distance the pair of them seem to be breathing down each others necks. Crowe and DiCaprio meet only for a few brief scenes but the crack and pop of their alpha-dogging dominate the movie -- even when theyre just bickering on the phone. Body of Lies is Scotts second film with William Monahan (after Kingdom of Heaven) and fourth with Crowe whos now done turns as a Roman gladiator an English vintner a New York cop and a vaguely southern thoroughly cynical CIA boss-man. (Next year hell play both Robin Hood and the Sheriff in Scotts Nottingham.) If this latest collaboration tends toward sun-baked machismo and spy-game conventions it exploits them well -- with solid acting and forthright direction that head-butts tough questions in the war on terror. But a word of caution torture. I understand as I did with Syriana the need to portray the full range of human behavior on all fronts and all sides in this complex and protracted conflict. But that doesnt mean I need close-ups of smashed body parts. If you dont either shut your eyes when you see the ball-peen hammer. Then wait till the screaming is over. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Unlocked Smartphones at eBay Up to 88% off from 26 + free...

By  Lisa Kennedy PUBLISHED October 8 2008 at 1213 pm | UPDATED May 7 2016 at 304 am Sign up for newsletters and alerts Submit your news tips or photos Most Popular Former Japanese consulate residence hits the Denver market for 4.2 million Sports Authority plans to pay top executives 2.85 million in bankruptcy bonuses Donald Trump stumps in Colorado promises ""No more Mr. Nice Guy"" Blake Shelton plays free intimate show at Denvers Grizzly Rose Tennis-ball-sized hail knocks out 27 Colorado Springs police cars Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Roger Ferris CIA intelligence handler calls him ""Buddy."" A Jordanian security honcho calls him ever so sweetly ""my dear."" In Ridley Scotts ""Body of Lies"" you can bet each mans endearment comes with caveats. The tagline for the thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe is ""Trust No One. Deceive Everyone."" So be prepared to plunge into the murk of intelligence work where relationships are painfully provisional and enemies can serve a vital purpose. Theres a chess match at the chilly heart of ""Body of Lies."" In fact there are enough matches going on that it resembles one of those days in a park where table after table hosts adversary upon adversary. The presumed masters of their universes are CIA vet Ed Hoffman (Crowe) and Hani Salaam (Mark Strong) who is head of Jordans General Intelligence Department. DiCaprio is Ferris a boots-on-the-ground intelligence operative working in the Middle East. Often Hoffman treats Ferris as a chess piece. But which one? Hes certainly no pawn. The bearded American has a sense of his value and an arguably naive notion hes his own man. He speaks Arabic. He has a deft feel for cross-cultural rules of engagement -- though an outrageously facile love story plopped into the mix suggests otherwise. Still parts of the job are beginning to gnaw at Ferris in ways Hoffman doesnt grasp or worse doesnt have time for. So what? Fewer bad guys get sacrificed in the hunt for badder guys. After a disastrous mission Ferris is made head of the post in Amman Jordan. This is where he meets Salaam. ""What have you heard about this place?"" the elegant Salaam asks Ferris when they meet. ""That they call it the fingernail factory."" The nattily dressed Hani has a very simple rule for his new American friend ""never lie to me."" Simple except for the line of work theyre in. Surprisingly late in the story Ferris hatches a plan to lure terrorist leader Al-Saleem (Alon Abutbul) out into the open. With the help from a high-tech specialist (Simon McBurney) Ferris hijacks a Jordanians identity gussies it up to make it appear hes the next Osama bin Laden or in this case the next Al-Saleem. It turns out that ideology -- even the true-believer kind -- isnt ego-free. Secrets lies and the liars that tell always provide a vast region for movie-makers to roam. Does Scott traverse it with any ambitions beyond mere diversion? Scott and screenwriter William Monahan use a lot of firepower to deliver an idea-skimpy thriller. This comes as a surprise given that the movie is based on a novel by Washington Post journalist David Ignatius. Its OK maybe even ethically necessary to want something more something serious (or at least cathartic) from movies that toy and torment with images of terror and torture. Terrorism flicks should not become just another genre like mob movies. Which brings us to DiCaprio. Martin Scorsese understands and continues to provide rich settings for the actors gifts. Unfortunately this is a Ridley Scott movie. While that works for Crowe it leaves DiCaprio looking a little out of place. Early on he looks too young too soft for the work Ferris does. He finds his rhythm when he flirts with an Iranian nurse (Golshifteh Farahani). The unlikely love story may make DiCaprio more believable. But its a clumsy sidetrip that makes the movie foolish. Crowe gives Hoffman a good-ole-boy twang and a nice home in the D.C. suburbs. He makes Hoffmans situational amorality palpable. But it doesnt take long to be dulled to scenes of his secured-line chatter with Ferris. There he is raking leaves from his pool. There he is taking his daughter to soccer. There he is munching a bowl of cereal. All the while Ferris calls from crowded dusty fraught locations. But once you grasp the notion hes comfy-cozy stateside and seldom ventures to the countries hes tinkering in theres not much more to learn. Scott is one of those directors whose lesser films never look or feel exactly that. And ""Body of Lies"" often moves with visual force and occasional flair. A scene of a low-level Al Qaeda operative pedaling his way back to Amman on a bike while a motorcade of black security vehicles leaves him in the dust is amusing. No one except Strong goes deep. His turn as Hani doesnt make the Jordanian likable. But it does make him powerfully watchable. ""Body of Lies"" is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedy denverpost.com.

"A tale of spies cells and pulp thrills - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review A tale of spies cells and pulp thrills Russell Crowe (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio play CIA agents in Ridley Scotts Body of Lies. (FRANCOIS DUHAMEL) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / October 10 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + In ""Body of Lies"" Leonardo DiCaprio sports an undergrowth of facial hair so mossy and unkempt I thought Id stumbled into an early screening of Steven Soderberghs ""Che."" The star is playing Roger Ferris our CIA agent on the ground in the Middle East and the scruff is supposed to help him blend in with the locals. Its also meant I think to give DiCaprio some visual gravitas - to make him look like a man among men. Perversely it makes him seem barely postadolescent. Even more perversely this helps the movie.""Body of Lies"" is based on a novel by journalist David Ignatius and directed by the estimable stylist Ridley Scott. The movie is an urgent current-events thriller that falls somewhere between ""Syriana"" and the ""Bourne"" movies. Its a genre film - the action is fierce and nonstop - with a brooding undercurrent of unease that aims for the complexities of John le Carre.Complexity in fact is the subject Those characters who can grasp the nuances of Middle East realpolitik are the films heroes. Those who see it through the filter of ideology - any ideology - are the villains. Ferris is caught in the middle an honorable but flawed hero owned by a bankrupt spook culture.The audience? Were on our own which is fine if youve followed the news and can keep up with the spinning datelines (Iraq Amman Dubai the Netherlands Langley) less so if its all one big Arab muddle to you. The two women sitting next to me in the screening spent most of the running time loudly wondering where we were now; I wanted to hand them an atlas and tell them to shut up.The heros CIA minder is Ed Hoffman Near East section head played by Russell Crowe with the doughy comic certainty of the boss in ""Dilbert."" As Ferris heads to Jordan to dig out an Al Qaeda nest one that hopefully leads to a nefarious Osama-style jihadist (Alon Aboutboul) hes never sure whether Hoffman is using him in a larger game.The joke is that Hoffmans always playing a larger game - its what gets him up in the morning. Crowe gives this D.C.-based suit a deliciously Machiavellian spin. We see him sending his kids off to school while chatting blithely with the frustrated Ferris via earpiece and the disconnect - from his home life from events in Amman from common morality - is frighteningly funny.Hoffmans opposite number is Hani Pasha (British actor Mark Strong) head of the Jordanian secret police and a smooth customer (he habitually calls Ferris ""my dear"") with a masterful command of political intricacies. Dedicated to capturing the terrorists hes a foxy strategist who knows when to use force and when to use persuasion; all he asks is that Ferris be truthful with him. The drama in ""Body of Lies"" deals with how much truth the hero can admit to or how much he even knows. Scott keeps the film rocketing along close to the trail here dashing out to the desert wastes there looping back to Europe for a terrifying marketplace explosion. Secondary characters zip in and out trailed by bullets or betrayal. Hovering above the fray like a paranoids daydream are spy planes that relay high-resolution images back to Langley and Hoffman; entire chunks of the film seem to have been brought to us by Google Earth. The irony is that Ferriss handlers see so much while comprehending so little.The script adaptation is by William Monahan and theres a whiff of ""The Departed"" in the profane crackle of the dialogue. (not to mention DiCaprios undercover agonizing). ""Body of Lies"" gets a nice second-act lift when the hero concocts a fake terrorist cell to lure the Al Qaeda mullah out of hiding. Using all the available electronic resources (marshaled by a diffident British wonk played by Simon McBurney) Ferris provides a jihadist identity for an innocent and unsuspecting Jordanian architect (Ali Suliman). These scenes feel like ""Mission Impossible"" played with real money tense because theyre so absurdly feasible.Yet ""Body of Lies"" is at heart a pulp thriller no more so than when the gifted Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani turns up as a fetching Amman nurse named Aisha who stitches Ferriss wounds and sets his heart aflutter. No slight to Farahani but her scenes play like sops to DiCaprios heartthrob following a concession to the notion that every movie needs a love interest or we wont pay attention.Well no not really. ""Body of Lies"" is about the evil that men do - often when they think theyre doing good - and the romance between Ferris and Aisha feels like a tacked-on Hollywood diversion. Anyway the movies real romance is between Ferris and the silky brutal Hani. Knowing all and seeing all the Jordanian seduces the American but would he seduce us so easily if the role had been cast with an Arab actor? Possibly. Nevertheless you wonder if Roger Ferris isnt the only person here with stars in his eyes. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/movienation.

For spymaster Ed Hoffman (Crowe) in Langley informants are live bait to catch a slippery fish. For his man in Amman Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) they are trusted allies in the war against al-Qaeda. One is a technocrat who trusts his surveillance tools the other a humanist who trusts people. Ferris the one who earns the faith of Jordanian and Syrian sources that Hoffman discards once they have served their purpose is horrified by his boss attitude. But is his chief so cynical that he would use Ferris to bait an Osama bin Laden type named Al-Saleem? Scott is a deft filmmaker who shows us (as he did in Black Hawk Down) how counterterrorism is conducted. Here the players are on the streets and in the cafes of Amman and the conductors are in Langley Va. - CIA surveillance agents sitting before panoramic displays of real-time reconnaissance captured by Predator drones - commanding the movements. The terrorist war plays out in widescreen with quadraphonic sound. Scott elicits muscular performances from his actors especially DiCaprio. Though the casting of him versus Crowe holds out the promise of a generational and ideological showdown there is none because their most fraught ideological duels have their characters scream into cell phones 6000 miles apart. (Screenwriter William Monahan similarly exploited mobile-phone dramatics in his Oscar-winning script for The Departed where the conceit was more effective because the characters were undercover.) Considerably more effective than the scenes between Ferris and Hoffman are those between the rumpled Ferris who hides behind his beard and crisply tailored clean-shaven Hani Salaam (British actor Mark Strong) chief of Jordanian intelligence who owns every scene he is in. Using his blazing eyes as truth-seeking lamps Hani is either Diogenes or a manipulator cleverer even than Hoffman. Like Scotts Kingdom of Heaven likewise based on a Monahan script Body of Lies has an unusually nuanced view of the history and politics of the Middle East. Often lost in the films erudition are the characters. As is customary in a Scott movie in every frame background events dynamically intrude on the action in the foreground. His film is full of compositional surprises that reward the attentive viewer. And it must be said it is also punctuated with unsparing gut-wrenching avert-the-eyes sequences of violence and torture. In the end Scotts film is a casualty of the conflict it explores. While its soul is with the tortured culturally sensitive and ultimately honorable Ferris its heart is with the cagey technocrat. Body of Lies is most alive while relishing the surveillance and communications tools abused by Hoffman tools that supply him military intelligence but not the smarts or scruples to effectively use it.

The acting in fact carries the day. The story which bounces between a CIA operative (DiCaprio) living and nearly dying in the worlds hottest spots and his porcine handler manipulating global events over the phone while watching his kids soccer games in Virginia is intriguing enough. But the actors elevate the material moving it past occasional slow points and obviousness with ease. Again we expect that from the two leads and they dont disappoint. But the most delightful surprise here is Mark Strong outstanding as Hani Salaam the natty honor-bound (when it suits him) and dangerous head of Jordanian intelligence. Never lie to him he warns Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) and things will work out just fine. Note the title. With this and with an equally effective turn in RocknRolla Guy Ritchies latest Cockney crime caper Strong has nailed two completely different enigmatic characters. Hes on quite a roll. The film establishes its two main characters right off the bat. Ferris is in the Middle East making contacts establishing ties gaining trust and getting information however he can. He doesnt just work with the locals; he lives among them cares about them. Ed Hoffman (Crowe) does not. This is established when someone Ferris is working with is killed. What will you do for his family? Ferris asks. What will you do Hoffman retorts. He was your friend. Hoffman wants results no matter the cost. ""I just offered him asylum"" Ferris complains after Hoffman turns down the request of a man who wants to leave al-Qaida. ""Well you lied buddy"" Hoffman replies. Ferris is a man of passion Hoffman a man of appetites. They clash often but need each other. Theyre setting up an operation - maybe more than one - to snare an upper-level member of al-Qaida. There are side deals and shady suboperations all over the place. Meanwhile as with any caper film worth its salt theres romance. Ferris falls for a nurse (Golshifteh Farahani) of Iranian descent. There are plenty of cultural obstacles to overcome - a lunch with her stern disapproving sister is a hoot. But theres also danger. Has Ferris never seen a movie like this? And yet like with so much of Body of Lies it doesnt really matter. Farahani too is good enough to overcome such a standard plot device. Scott builds the tension nicely. This is a part of the world where its preferable to be killed by a colleague than beheaded on the Internet. And he does not shy away from intense scenes of violence and torture. In one as a man is flogged Ferris reminds Salaam of his claim that torture is ineffective. But this Salaam points out isnt torture. Its punishment. Big difference. Honor still counts for something Body of Lies seems to be saying. But honor is hard to find takes many forms and leads to unexpected complications. A rocky road in other words but one DiCaprio Crowe and Strong make worth following. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Francois Duhamel) C- Body of Lies Genre Drama; Starring Russell Crowe Leonardo DiCaprio Mark Strong Carice van Houten; Director Ridley Scott; Author William Monahan; Release Date Wide 10/10/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 126; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted October 16 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT Body of Lies is a terrible title for a globe-trotting espionage drama -- it sounds more like a cable-ready ""erotic"" thriller starring Colin Farrell and Madonna. That tacky and meaningless title is a tip-off; it lets us know just how desperate the filmmakers are to please. Body of Lies has a lot of big important explosions (whole buildings get blown up) plus the usual cars-barreling-through- the-Third-World-bazaar set pieces and sky-track surveillance shots that invite us to suck in our breath at the awesome telescopic reach of the CIAs omnipresent eye. Yet most of this just seems you know so three years ago so Bourne again. The director that veteran big-budget action painter Ridley Scott huffs and puffs to give a topical undercover scenario the patina of relevance. Really though hes fighting the last war -- and I dont mean Iraq or Afghanistan which Scott knows all too well are losers at the box office. I mean the Cold War. Working from a screenplay by William Monahan (The Departed) which is based on a David Ignatius novel Scott takes rusty 80s cliches from the days when we were playing nuclear chicken with Russia and retrofits them to the post-9/11 world. He exposes how weary those old spy tropes really are. Leonardo DiCaprio with a snaky undergrowth of beard that makes him look like a mandarin Cheshire cat plays Roger Ferris a CIA operative who has come as close as anyone in the agency to penetrating the enigmatic thicket of loyalties within the Middle East. Ferris speaks Arabic and he knows that in the faceless world of international terror information is king. He is also patched more or less permanently into the laptop of Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) a middle-aged CIA veteran who now sits around at home in the suburbs or in his Langley Va. office tracking Ferris movements on a spiffy wall-size monitor. The whole world is at his fingertips which may be why Hoffman barely bothers to get out of his armchair. Crowe with a graying bristle cut and 50 added pounds gives Hoffman a smug drawl and he spends the movie uttering each line in the same folksy-flat Its all business son voice and peering again and again over the top of his officious spectacles. He seems to be phoning in his performance on purpose which doesnt make it any less rote. Ferris and Hoffman are out to entrap the mysterious jihadist leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul) a bin Laden figure who has left a trail of bombings and videotapes. In Jordan Ferris makes contact with Hani Salaam (Mark Strong) the head of the countrys General Intelligence Department which primes us for some seriously knotty intrigue. You dont after all catch Americas most wanted terrorist mastermind by looking him up in the Amman yellow pages. Ferris uses Hani to connect with an informer who will penetrate a local safe house. But the idea that Al-Saleem could in fact be nabbed through a safe house or that a stray jihadist who ""turned"" could be counted on to expose him is like a scenario left over from the Brezhnev era or maybe the age of Casablanca. Mark Strong the debonair British actor who plays Hani (hes like a taller more insinuating Andy Garcia) does indeed have glittering hints of Old Hollywood malice pouring through his courtly charm. DiCaprio by contrast seems trapped?in that baby face in his increasing inability to create even a dash of subtext. Ferris is attracted to an Iranian nurse and nothing the star does makes this more than a laughably generic romance. Maybe its just the role but the gifted DiCaprio is starting to come off as a less-than-inspired actor. His heart needs to catch fire again. After a dead-dull first hour the film arrives at its one promising twist Ferris and Hoffman try to flush out Al-Saleem by inventing a fake rival terrorist whose existence will lure him into the open. This plot should have been the whole film; had it been executed convincingly we might have relaxed into the hokey halfway plausible notion of defeating a terrorist by mimicking what he does. Body of Lies has the action scenes that may by now be the only way to sell a ""political"" thriller. Theres a helicopter chase done in Scotts technological blam-blam style and a torture finale staged in an icky exploitative way. Yet the movie skirts the most common-sense realities of how dispersed and concealed our enemies really are. That makes it not just far-fetched but monotonous. C?

By David Denby Russell Crowe and Leonardo DiCaprio in Ridley Scotts new thriller.   Credit ANDY FRIEDMAN Theres a startling moment in ""Body of Lies"" the potent new thriller directed by Ridley Scott--a moment that not only crystallizes what the movie is about but shrewdly demonstrates the ironies of asymmetrical warfare in the age of terror. The hardworking C.I.A. field agent Roger Ferris (Leonardo DiCaprio) has got himself involved in a complicated plan to smoke out a Middle Eastern terrorist leader who has been coordinating a series of attacks in Europe. But Ferris based in Amman Jordan makes the mistake of falling in love with an Iranian-born nurse (Golshifteh Farahani). When shes kidnapped by the terrorists he offers himself in exchange for her freedom. Ferriss boss Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe) a C.I.A. honcho who has been running Ferris by cell phone and laptop from the suburbs of Washington arrives in the Middle East to watch the exchange by means of a Predator drone flying over the desert. The C.I.A. wants to see where Ferris is being taken; its willing to use him as bait. But the terrorists dont play along; they arrive in four S.U.V.s drive around in a circle (kicking up a cloud of dust which blocks the Predators view) snatch Ferris and drive off in four different directions. Which S.U.V. should the Americans follow? Its a sharp precis of the entire movie the Americans have all the technological advantages but they dont know the people the signs of trust and honor; they dont know which way the terrorists are going and they cant find out. The screenwriter William Monahan (""The Departed"") working from a novel by the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius presents Ferris as a kind of ideal and he appears depressingly to be the only one in the C.I.A. with the cultural sensitivity to understand the nature of the war were fighting. Hoffman a sweet-voiced but ruthless Southerner has made antiterrorism into his calling--for him civilization is at stake--but hes too impatient. In the end the Americans are scrambling for bits of information pulling computer disks out of blown-up hideouts using people in the Middle East left and right and then discarding them. People are killed by lies. This movie is not about a war that we are winning. Much of the atmosphere and the action of ""Body of Lies"" is familiar from such recent films as ""The Kingdom"" ""Rendition"" ""Vantage Point"" and ""Traitor."" Ridley Scott flips back and forth from Washington to the Middle East from drone surveillance to the street from explosions and scenes of torture to men tearing across the desert with guns blazing. But the movie is smart and tightly drawn; it has a throat-gripping urgency and some serious insights and Scott has a greater command of space and a more explicit way with violence than most thriller directors--Ferris gets mashed like a Florida orange in a squeezer. Best of all Scott after all these years has become a good director of acting. The British stage-and-TV actor Mark Strong in superbly tailored Savile Row suits with patrician manners to match is great fun to watch as Hani Salaam the brilliant Jordanian intelligence chief a man with burning eyes who will punish anyone who tries to lie to him. (He reserves deception for his own use.) DiCaprio bearded speaking Arabic with a variety of accents gives a performance that is as fine and as intense as his work in ""The Departed"" and ""Blood Diamond."" He doesnt try to look cool; he sticks to the dirty business at hand. Along with Matt Damon he is our most reliably effective young leading man. His Ferris has a streak of decency that makes him ashamed of the way the Americans deceive and manipulate people and he gets into profane knockabout arguments with Crowe whose soft Southern tones which try to cover cynicism with charm only make him angrier. The craft of the movie is superb but in an odd way ""Body of Lies"" replicates the dilemma that it shows the C.I.A. confronting. Structurally the movie revolves around simultaneous knowledge again and again Ferris is somewhere in the desert or in the street dodging his pursuers while trying to reel in a guy who wants to quit Al Qaeda and as everyone begins shooting Hoffman is in his suburban house following the action by one electronic means or another while helping to get his kids off to school. His consumption habits are a recurring joke. Hes a greedy American domestic animal--an advanced-media freak always eating while Ferris is getting mauled six thousand miles away. The movie shares Hoffmans mastery of space and time but like some of his virtuosic but pointless manipulations it has the feeling of a spasmodic exercise in the void. In the end terror still escapes the filmmakers understanding. Poppy (Sally Hawkins) the single thirty-year-old London kindergarten teacher in Mike Leighs comedy ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" bounces on a trampoline at the gym after work but she doesnt need much of a lift--shes already airborne. Poppy has a bunny-hop walk a chirping voice and carnival clothes; she could be taken as a greeter at a medieval street fair. Shes always happy and when a smile takes over Sally Hawkinss face her eyes crinkle and she looks a little like Lily Tomlin in a goofy mood. Poppy doesnt often take seriously what others take seriously; shes meant to be slightly annoying but shes a heroine nonetheless or at least a test case for a heroine. Is the possession of the happiness gene enough to get you through life without harm? Or to put it less grandly can a woman like Poppy serve as the protagonist of a full-length movie? Leigh has not been known for a skipping-along-the-hedgerows view of existence. His vivid funny and biting films have made us aware of the misery of dashed expectations (""High Hopes"") the power of surly narcissism (""Naked"") the underside of creative partnership (""Topsy-Turvy"") the depths of working-class forlornness (""All or Nothing"") and inarticulate sacrifice (""Vera Drake""). But now hes put at the center of a film a young woman who teases sourpuss clerks and comforts a crazy bum whose grunts and snarls she understands. Shes a heroine because shes afraid of nothing. Poppy likes to drink with her mates (mainly other female teachers) and she lights up when an attractive young man takes an interest in her. Leigh surrounds her with a realistic social world--workplace family students a variety of grumpy and dissatisfied people. She greets them all with such frothy benevolence that you fear for her. Yet the movie shot on sunshiny light-filled days feels joyous and loose-limbed and the audience learns to relax and go with it. As always Leigh improvised with his actors for weeks and settled on a script late in the rehearsal process. Some of the scenes are a little ragged but theres so much life going on that one doesnt mind missing a line or two of dialogue and Leigh brings an off-center humor to everything he stages. Poppy goes to a flamenco class and faces with a group of women a fierce teacher (Karina Fernandez) from Spain who has erect posture and passionate control of the sculpted gesture--she embodies the very principle of order purpose and dignity that Poppy neglects. But the dancers view of life is so tragic (dancing she says will express her grief and her desire for revenge) that she becomes a mask of woe and amazingly spins out of control. At that point we understand more clearly what Leigh is doing. He will match his carefree heroine against a series of people (including a little bully boy in her class) who try to overcome their unhappiness either by behaving as aggressively as possible or by clinging to a fixed moral code. Poppy takes driving lessons and her sessions with a querulous instructor Scott (Eddie Marsan) turn into a moral and philosophical tussle. Marsan is a tiny clenched man with a scrunched-up face discolored teeth and a pointed beard--he looks like one of those lost figures in the corners of Renaissance paintings chewing out their innards on the way to Hell. Scotts fury which seems as organic to him as cheerfulness is to Poppy has turned him into a pedant. Driving properly is his way of doing Gods work and everything else in the world is ""ignorance and fear."" Poppy offends him with her sexy boots which make it hard for her to find the clutch and with her rubbernecking interest in squirrels and good-looking men on the street. Leigh is such an evenhanded observer that he can allow us to see that crazy Scott isnt always wrong--Poppy probably wont be a very good driver. But as their struggle reaches a comic climax Leigh answers the question we have been harboring at what point does empathy reach its limits? The movie is not an argument for chaos; its an argument for making ones way through life with a relaxed will and an open heart. The optimism is exploratory not programmatic; Leigh is no flower child. The only trouble with his scheme is that he has counterposed free-spiritedness and paralyzed moralism as mutually exclusive states and there has to be something else--something like Leighs film itself which knows how to play easily within a firm over-all structure. ""Happy-Go-Lucky"" is triumphant proof that a creative middle way is always possible.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

Neither the location-based verisimilitude of Ridley Scotts shooting style nor the estimable Middle East expertise of source-material author David Ignatius can disguise ""Body of Lies"" as anything other than the contrived phony-baloney it is. Coming on like an inside account of CIA operations against jihad-minded terrorists pic shows its true colors by featuring a shootout chase or big explosion every 10 minutes or so on its way to a climax so conventional it would have been at home in a 1940s Warner Bros. melodrama. Despite the Iraq War hovering in the background Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe leading the charge in a high-octane would-be thriller should produce solid mainstream B.O. worldwide. Due to Scotts clear interest in West vs. Arab conflict explored in both ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Kingdom of Heaven"" novelist and journalist Ignatius intimate knowledge of the scene and scenarist William Monahans proven skill with complicated narratives and pungent dialogue there was reason here to hope for something more than an updated companion piece to Ridleys brother Tonys 2001 espionage meller ""Spy Game."" The setup certainly has merit. A dedicated Arabist and fluent in the language rough-and-tumble CIA op Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) works the treacherous streets of the Middle East be it in Iraq Jordan or Syria trying to recruit help infiltrate cells and uncover plots against steep odds. His boss back in Langley Ed Hoffman (Crowe) is a blunt realist who admits that a democracy is ""an easy target"" and that it wouldnt be all that hard to bring Western civilization down. Better yet the story hinges on an ingenious plot hatched by Ferris to flush out a shadowy master terrorist whos embarked upon a series of devastating bombings against civilian targets but never steps forward to take credit Ferris creates an entirely fictitious rival terror organization whose atrocities and unknown leader are designed to force the real perpetrator far enough into the open for apprehension. Sounds like a cant-miss premise. But Scott and Monahan who teamed on ""Kingdom of Heaven"" take a mostly formulaic approach that becomes more disappointing as the yarn unwinds right up to the cornball denouement that is everything that even some internal dialogue had promised it wouldnt be. Working in similar rugged-modern-adventurer mode as he did in ""Blood Diamond"" DiCaprio frequently gets roughed up and bloodied to the point where his character even seems to like it. As he tries to ferret out a potential informant in the Iraqi desert or to run surveillance on a terrorist safe house in Amman Ferris is observed by Hoffman via crisp overhead images provided by high-flying drones. Given the technology at hand it seems surprising the CIA doesnt enjoy a higher success rate than it appears to. But as Hoffman himself best articulates terrorists can flourish by going no-tech relying on quiet person-to-person communications. This is where Ferris proves invaluable at least to the extent that Hoffman permits him to function on his own terms. Conflict between Ferris micro approach and Hoffmans concern for the macro surfaces in their respective dealings with Jordanian intelligence chief Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). An urbane and elegant sophisticate Hani chafes at Hoffmans crudeness but quickly recognizes Ferris smarts and agrees to cooperate with his efforts to nail Islamist mastermind Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). Scenes between Ferris and Hani possess a heightened vibrance stemming from two sharp skillful men recognizing their respective qualities and working out a mutually beneficial modus operandi. At one point some nasty wounds land Ferris in the hospital where he is ministered to by lovely nurse Aisha (Iranian thesp Golshifteh Farahani). Pic is attentive to the extreme cultural difficulties of even the most modest social exchanges between an American man and a Muslim woman under such circumstances; men glare at them when they share tea at a public cafe and Aishas conservative sister (Lubna Azabal) gives Ferris an earful when he comes for lunch. Despite the sociopolitical points of interest and even insight however the scenario begins to feel contorted and ultimately poisoned by its adherence to movie conceits rather than real-world terms; the film capitulates to what its thought audiences want from Hollywood action cinema rather than going its own original way with material that could have been far more absorbing and provocative. No matter how credible and realistic the urban and countryside scenes may look (many Morocco locations doubled for the numerous Middle Eastern locales represented) what takes place in them comes off as increasingly hokey and concocted. In the end ""Body of Lies"" infuses the thriller format with hot modern issues less successfully than did last years ""The Kingdom."" DiCaprio throws himself into the middle of dangerous doings much as he did in ""Blood Diamond"" and ""The Departed"" that is to say with grit determination and an underlying need to prove something. Strong makes a marked impression as the cultivated Jordanian spy boss Farahani brings spirit to a standard role and Simon McBurney adds another eccentric to his resume as a nerdy computer genius. And then theres Russell Crowe. Asked by Scott to put on 50 pounds for the role of the Cofer Black-like CIA figure the actor has clearly obliged to the point where he now looks like a candidate to succeed the late great JT Walsh as a specialist in beefy menacing supporting characters. Sporting cropped salt-and-pepper hair and an Arkansas accent Crowe literally phones this one in -- as perhaps half his performance is spent speaking by cell phone to DiCaprio overseas; the other half has him peering over reading glasses to make his point. It would be nice to see this great actor toughen up again and take on some more challenging roles. Tech qualities are on a par with Scotts usual high standards with the directors longtime camera operator-second unit director and cameraman Alexander Witt making his debut as a full d.p.
