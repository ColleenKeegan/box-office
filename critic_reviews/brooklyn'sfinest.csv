Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Mar. 05 2010 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 313PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Brooklyns Finest Directed by Antoine Fuqua Written by Michael C. Martin Starring Don Cheadle Richard Gere and Ethan Hawke Classification 14A Mould Its eating into the walls of narcotic squad cop Sal (Ethan Hawke). House mould is threatening the life of his asthmatic wife (Lili Taylor) and the future of the twins shes carrying. Sal has to buy a new house but the only way he can get the down payment is by robbing money from the drug dealers and other criminal scum he fights every day. While mould works as a serviceable metaphor for the rot in the system mouldy might also describe the screenplay for Brooklyns Finest which seems to have been dragged out of basement storage where it was left in the seventies and early eighties when melodramas about New York cop corruption ( Serpico Prince of the City) were in vogue. As directed by Antoine Fuqua the film is well-acted occasionally hair-raising but ultimately made from stale material. Telling the separate stories of three unconnected Brooklyn policemen first-time screenplay writer Michael C. Martins tells three familiar morality plays of cops who as someone says in the opening scene have lost their sense of ""righter and wronger"" and are headed for catastrophe. First up is Sal who turns to desperate measures to help his family. Next is Tango (Don Cheadle) an undercover cop torn between loyalty and duty to get a promotion he needs to lure recent ex-con Caz (Wesley Snipes) who saved Tangos life in prison back into a life of crime. Third up is Eddie (Richard Gere) as a suicidal burned-out cop a week shy of retirement looking for one last chance at redemption. Each of the actors has strong moments but the relentless intensity becomes monotonous. Everything in the movie - to use Spinal Tap parlance - is tuned to 11. In the confessional Sal goes chin to chin with his priest through the grate and gasps ""I dont want Gods forgiveness. I want his fuggin help."" Bare-breasted prostitutes are dragged and slapped about or simply provide decor in gangsters grimy apartments. Ellen Barkin playing a crazy careerist police department boss talks like shes gnawing on a mouthful of nails. Shooting victims stand glaze-eyed for a moment as blood curls from their mouths before they collapse. In 2001 director Fuqua made Training Day featuring Denzel Washington in an Oscar-winning performance as a corrupt cop with Hawke as his wide-eyed apprentice. Both films had a similar milieu of relentless seediness and violence but the ""rogue boss"" dilemma in Training Day was considerably easier to identify with and the grimness didnt preclude some humour. In contrast too many scenes in Brooklyns Finest involve actors going eyeball-to-eyeball in various intimidation games. Theres also a nagging sense that their fates are less a product of circumstances and character than a screenwriters machinations. At the risk of seeming banal before grabbing his gun and going hunting for drug money perhaps Sal should have investigated the Yellow Pages for a reliable anti-mould technician.

Within the first several minutes of the movie one name-brand actors character is killed and another one sticks a gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Movie Information Brooklyns FinestRatingShowtimes | Official site and trailerDirector Antoine FuquaActors Don Cheadle Ethan Hawke Richard Gere Wesley Snipes Will Patton Ellen Barkin Brian F. OByrne and Lili TaylorRun time 125 minutesMPAA rating R (bloody violence throughout strong sexuality nudity drug content and pervasive language)Synopsis Wesley Snipes (playing a drug dealer) Ethan Hawke Richard Gere and Don Cheadle star in this crime drama from Antoine Fuqua (Training Day).More movies from GuideLive.comThe gun turns out to be unloaded but you get the message. Its one the movie hammers home again and again over the course of two-plus hours Life on these mean streets is cheap brutal and ugly.Doesnt that sound fun? Fun plainly was not on the minds of director Antoine Fuqua or screenwriter Michael C. Martin. For his part the Training Day director tries to generate some heat with his detail-dense depiction of inner-city life a grim gray and grubby project where 15000 people are packed into 18 buildings. Martins screenplay on the other hand just keeps serving up the cop-criminal cliches. Everything is hard everyone is hopeless. There are good cops gone bad and bad guys trying to be good but the system is so broken that nothing anyone does is ever really going to make a difference.The problem for filmmakers trying to make this kind of movie is that they are now operating in a post-Wire world. That brilliant HBO series set the standard for depth sophistication nuance and complexity. And youve got to do more than hire some of that shows alumni as actors and churn out the moral ambiguities.Here it just comes off as well-acted and occasionally flashy wheel-spinning. We follow three cops Theres Sal (Ethan Hawke) a decent guy and probably once upon a time a good detective whos drowning in the debt hes racking up trying to support his sick and pregnant wife (the great if woefully underused Lili Taylor) and brood of kids. Theres Tango (Don Cheadle) the cop whos been undercover as a drug dealer for so long hes gone half-native and full-on crazy. And then theres Eddie (Richard Gere) the burned-out beat cop whos just seven tick-tock days from retiring.These three are like mountain climbers scaling the same peak from different sides. They wind their way through the movie dragging their bitter downbeat stories with them on a collision course in the movies blam-blam ridiculously improbable finale.There are some resonant moments and some solid acting along the way but this movie keeps the life-is-hard no-easy-answers theme blasting like an air-raid siren throughout the trip down this boulevard of broken dreams. When just about everybody shoots just about everybody else the only appropriate response is relief. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

By Peter Rainer Film critic March 4 2010 Save for later Saved Actors Jesse Williams left and Richard Gere are shown in a scene from ""Brooklyns Finest."" Phillip V. Caruso/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Cop movies and TV shows are so omnipresent that its difficult imagining anything radically new happening to the genre. The best one can hope for nowadays is a variation on a theme. Compared with the recent monumentally awful ""Cop Out"" I suppose the new Antoine Fuqua melodrama ""Brooklyns Finest"" is acceptable. Then again you could say that about any movie in comparison with ""Cop Out."" As you can tell Im a big fan of ""Cop Out.""But back to the matter at hand. Fuqua is best known for directing ""Training Day"" an overrated cop movie starring an Oscar-winning Denzel Washington as a good-bad cop who might have received his training in Hades. The Brooklyn in this new film isnt far removed from that location. Three cops all of them in varying stages of psychological meltdown gradually come apart before our eyes leaving behind them a wake of corpses and cash. If ever there was a nonrecruitment movie for police work this is it. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? IN PICTURES Academy Award for Best Picture nominees Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Gallery Academy Award for Best Picture nominees 2010 Brooklyns Finest movie review We first see Richard Geres Eddie waking up alone in a crummy apartment and reaching for a bottle of booze and a gun which he inserts into his mouth before having second (third?) thoughts. Eddie is weeks away from retirement. Guess the benefits arent so hot.Don Cheadles Tango is an undercover cop who is deeply implicated in the kingpin empire of his friend Caz (Wesley Snipes). Ethan Hawkes Sal is a narcotics cop who is looking to score some drug money so he can move his asthmatic wife (Lili Taylor) out of their mold-infested house.These three crosscutting stories are all pointed in the same direction - down down down. Soon the bottom is hit and the body count reaches epidemic proportions. Besides the three leads a lot of other good actors such as Vincent DOnofrio Brian F. OByrne and Ellen Barkin put in appearances. They are all better than the film deserves.On second thought ""Brooklyns Finest"" does indeed provide a new genre twist. This must be the only cop movie ever made where a character is driven off the deep end by mold.

"Review Brooklyns Finest - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMOVIE REVIEW Review Brooklyns FinestDirector Antoine Fuquas new cop drama doesnt match his Training Day.March 05 2010|By BETSY SHARKEY | Film Critic Underachieving beat cop Eddie (Richard Gere right) is a week away from... (Phillip V. Caruso / Overture...)""Brooklyns Finest"" is an old-style potboiler about desperate cops in dire straits that overcooks both its story and its stars with Ethan Hawke Don Cheadle and Richard Gere the main ingredients left stewing. It is also the latest compromised-cop drama from director Antoine Fuqua and though there are satisfying moments to be found at its best the film only echoes the electrifyingly unpredictable thrill of ""Training Day"" his 2001 breakthrough hit that earned Hawke an Oscar nomination as a rookie at risk. This latter-day tale of the boys in blue begins at a boil dark deeds spilling all over the place in no time and everyone perched on one ledge or another. The action unfolds over a typical week in a Brooklyn precinct whose energies and ethics are constantly tested by the neighborhoods drug-infested overcrowded poverty-ridden projects just teeming with problems. But its not work that connects our three law and orders as much as a sense of place one of the directors strengths. So at ease is the filmmaker inside the various dens of iniquity designed to tempt our cops that the smell of those caged by circumstance fairly reeks. That authenticity is helped along by much of the movie being shot on the ground in Brooklyn -- and were not talking the upscale Brooklyn Heights or the hipster chic of Williamsburg here. With the local drug trade drawing cops like moths to a flame Fuqua and cinematographer Patrick MurguAa keep everything else on the dark side as they move along the streets inside bars and dingy diners and the even dingier precinct house capturing the swagger and the rising anxiety as effectively as the grit and grime. Like neat little lines of cocaine all roads lead to the projects where the devil roams the alleys picking through the garbage for a few good souls. That is right in Fuquas wheelhouse and some of the brilliance that seared ""Training Day"" burns in ""Brooklyn."" Violence rolls through like thunderstorms merciless and bloody and its at its most menacing when Fuqua is working in tight spaces -- a hallway a basement a car. He has a tougher time with the characters all archetypes tightly wound little nuanced and ensnared in a web that pulls them deeper into the muck with each scene. Gere has the least to work with in Eddie an underachieving beat cop a week away from his pension trying to keep his head down and get out alive. Theres more roughage for Cheadle in Tango the undercover slick whos in so deep hes not sure where his allegiance lies especially now that the main wiseguy Wesley Snipes Caz who once saved him is out of jail. Snipes is back reminding everyone just how good he can be his blinged-out drug lord as seductively charismatic as he is lethal. It is Hawke though who seems the most at home as the increasingly unhinged narcotics hot shot facing the kind of temptations and pressures that come with the job. In one of his rambling conversations with his priest he snaps ""I dont want Gods forgiveness I want his help."" The years have etched his face with a tortured weariness and wariness and there are moments in ""Brooklyn"" that exploit the full force of its power just not enough. Screenwriter Michael C. Martin in his feature debut brings all the passion and imperfection of a rookie to the project with the complexity a drama like this demands too often lost amid the cliches. The cracks are partly covered by an experienced cast -- Ellen Barkin cruising through as an agent with ambitions as brittle as her bleached hair is a welcome sight -- but its still a bumpy ride leaving ""Brooklyns Finest"" never able to live up to its name. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESOlympus Has Fallens Antoine Fuqua seeks truth amid...March 20 2013Washingtons Arresting Performance Drives a Thrilling...October 5 2001A Story From the StreetsSeptember 9 2001MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesReviewEntertainmentDrugCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-brooklyn5-2010mar05,0,2865434.story",200,brooklyn'sfinest7,brooklyn'sfinest,latimes

Every scene brings something new and remarkable--if not quite wonderful--to look at yet every scene sweeps away specific recollections of the previous one. Looked at through one lens thats a tribute to the immediacy of the images as well as the wizardly integration of live and computer-generated action. Looked at through another though its a signal that Mr. Burton and his colleagues like so many filmmakers before them were flummoxed by the Lewis Carroll conundrum--not the one about why a raven is like a writing desk but why that peerless authors enchanting prose should be so resistant to dramatization. Watch a clip from Tim Burtons take on ""Alice in Wonderland"" starring Johnny Depp Mia Wasikowska Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway. Video courtesy of Walt Disney. To be fair about Disneys latest attempt to chronicle Alices trips down the rabbit hole and through the looking glass--the studios 1951 animated version still has its passionate partisans and detractors--drama isnt what the target audience will be coming for. Both Mr. Burton and Disney are global brands--better-known brands than Lewis Carroll these days--and the merchandise theyve manufactured fulfills two sets of expectations. Its more gothic than Victorian and slightly tinctured with danger but fully equipped with the sort of exuberant action that sits well in movie theaters and better still in the great theme-park hereafter. The heroine is played with sweet verve by the Australian actress Mia Wasikowska. This Alice at the ripe young age of 19 is returning to the magical world of her childhood so she knows its all a dream. Still Linda Woolvertons screenplay makes it clear that shes much less sophisticated than she thinks. Dream or not Alice is caught up in a power struggle that is raging between the forces of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and the poor girls most reliable guide is the Mad Hatter who is played by Johnny Depp. As you might expect--as his fans surely expect--Mr. Depps mincing flouncing Mad Hatter bears more than a passing resemblance to Jack Sparrow though Hatters faint lisp and gap-toothed grin also suggest Laurence Oliviers Archie Rice in ""The Entertainer"" or a young Boris Karloff doing Humphrey Bogart. Hes very funny in mildly funny surroundings that are peopled--creatured--by such bizarre creations as the doughnut-necked beetle-browed and shaved-headed Tweedledum and Tweedledee. (I did like the Blue Caterpillar intimately voiced by Alan Rickman.) But theres nothing mild about Ms. Bonham Carters Red Queen. Shes quick and fierce with Cupids-bow lips a Bette Davis forehead and a huge cranium atop a tiny body. She gets a big laugh every time she howls ""Off with her head"" and she stops the show every time shes on screen. ENLARGE Helena Bonham Carter above at right is the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland. Disney Related Speakeasy Alice in Wonderland Review Revue Speakeasy Selling Alice in Wonderland One Eyeshadow at a Time Disney Invites Goths to the Party Johnny Depp Helena Bonham Carter in Sweeney Todd How she does it says a lot about the actors craft and helps to clarify what the movie is missing. Ms. Bonham Carters star turn in a secondary role is exquisite for its precision and economy. In writing about her performance as the pie maker Mrs. Lovett in Mr. Burtons ""Sweeney Todd"" I admired her song-and-dance-womans sense of timing and thats vividly in evidence once again. When the Red Queen says ""I need a pig here"" its a regal request for a footrest issued casually; she is clearly accustomed to comforting her feet with warm pork bellies. Mr. Depp can be a phenomenal performer too but not this time. Like the production as a whole his Mad Hatter is an agreeably whimsical yet unsurprising assemblage while Ms. Bonham Carters absolute monarch is a force of unnature and a triumphant illogician. The most surprising thing about ""Alice in Wonderland"" is its general lack of surprise. Was Mr. Burton so distracted by the demands of the complex effects that he had to settle for conventionality? Its not an unreasonable assumption; distraction has become endemic to such productions which need the services of a field marshal rather than a director. Whatever the cause or causes the results are showy but patchy and initially pokey. A leisurely preface shows Alice not only as a child dreaming her Wonderland dreams but as a bride-to-be faced with the prospect of imprisonment in a ghastly marriage. (If that sections bleached almost colorless look was meant to be a comment on the bloodless society of Alices upbringing it was an unattractive and uninviting idea.) As the White Queen Ms. Hathaway has little to do but look pretty which she does and vaguely abstracted like a woman wandering around a beauty parlor while she waits for her nails to dry. A succession of chases and fanciful combats more akin to Dungeons amp; Dragons than to Carroll leads to a peculiarly truncated climax. The 3-D effects are enjoyable but the added depth cant make up for deficits in the concept or the plot. At bottom the concept is earnest bordering on commonplace a coming-of-age story in which Alice takes therapeutic refuge in her fantasies and emerges from them a stronger person. As for the plot or lack of it the filmmakers can be blamed only up to a point. They havent solved the Lewis Carroll conundrum havent cracked the structural code because Carrolls discursive masterworks dont have much structure and can be dramatized only up to a point even though their imagery is endlessly tantalizing. The unseizable essence of the two books isnt pictures at all the Tenniel illustrations notwithstanding. Its the scintillating interplay of language and logic satiric wit and sublime silliness. For those who have tried to capture the books on screen and for those who will try in the future its a case of read em and weep. Brooklyns Finest ENLARGE From left Richard Gere and Ethan Hawke as police officers in Brooklyns Finest. Overture Films ""Just keep everybody calm"" Richard Geres soul-sick veteran cop tells the rookie hes been assigned to work with in ""Brooklyns Finest."" Its an echo of ""Training Day"" Antoine Fuquas strong 2001 thriller with Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke. But no one is calm in Mr. Fuquas new film which co-stars Mr. Hawke as one of three Brooklyn cops in desperate straits. (The third is played by Don Cheadle.) The directors governing principle must have been to keep everybody agitated overwrought and profanely prolix while the rookie writer Michael C. Martin kept everything derivative Scorsese Tarantino Richard Price ""The Departed"" ""The Wire"" you name it and he imitated it. Whatever one may think of the overall style--I think its ludicrous--Mr. Fuqua clearly wanted his film to be operatic and so it is in a tone-deaf way. It is also alas interlocking in a way that slavishly emulates ""Crash"" (which staked its own claim to absurdity). I wont belabor the specifics of the story except to say that Mr. Hawkes desperate cop Sal needs money for a new house because his wife is pregnant with twins and the house theyre living in has suddenly come down with a case of wood mold. In that sense if no other ""Brooklyns Finest"" is a cautionary tale. Mold is deadly. It can even infect movies. Write to Joe Morgenstern at joe.morgensternwsj.com DVD Focus ENLARGE Spirited Away (2001) Hayao Miyazakis animated masterpiece distributed in the U.S. by Disney could also be described as a coming-of-age story in which a girl takes refuge in her fantasies and emerges from them a stronger person. But what breathtaking fantasies they are and what mysteries they contain. The 10-year-old heroine Chihiro finds herself alone after her parents make memorable pigs of themselves at an abandoned restaurant and forges a new life for herself in a glittering steaming hot-springs resort where spirits of every shape disposition and composition--good and evil opaque and transparent--come to refresh themselves. ENLARGE Chocolat (2000) Johnny Depp is Roux a handsome young rogue with what seems to be an Irish accent in this big-hearted petit-pois-brained exercise in retro-Gallic nostalgia. Juliette Binoche is Vianne a beautiful and mysterious woman who opens a store that sells magical chocolate candies--Viagra-cum-saturated fat. Though the setting is supposedly 1960s France the story really takes place in a timeless picturesque village--Brigadoon-cum-Deux Chevaux--populated with every cultural stereotype that France has ever inflicted on a gullible world (and to be fair on itself.) The cast includes Alfred Molina. Lasse Hallstrom directed. ENLARGE Hamlet (2000) Michael Almereydas daring update gives us the Danish prince played by Ethan Hawke as a film school student who has not only lost all his mirth but his grip on objective reality. This perpetual postadolescent watches movies on a mini-VCR as he slouches around midtown Manhattan in a knitted hat and a purple funk. Sure the movies a stunt but one that succeeds much more often than it stumbles. Julia Stiles plays Ophelia with mixed results though her mad scene staged on the helical ramp of the Guggenheim Museum is exquisite as well as slightly mad in its own right. --Joe Morgenstern Find related television listings at LocateTV.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. March 5 2010 Starring Richard Gere Don Cheadle Ethan Hawke and Wesley Snipes. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. 140 minutes. At major theatres. 14A The real detective work required for Brooklyns Finest Antoine Fuquas ensemble cop drama opening Friday is why this movie with its blue-ribbon cast led by such a talented director (Training Day) fails to jell.Primary suspect is the story penned by first-timer Michael C. Martin as an entry in a scriptwriting contest (he didnt win). It tells three tales set in the same Brooklyn police division that spin independently until they meet in a final predictable endgame at a rundown apartment block. Theres nothing particularly original here in this grime-and-grit saga but the weak material is elevated by the cast.Article Continued BelowFuqua has assembled Ethan Hawke (also in Training Day) Don Cheadle Wesley Snipes and Richard Gere - hes the surprisingly weak link here - for this bloody boys club tour of Brooklyns mean streets.Hawke shines as a credit-crunched Catholic cop desperate to find a better life for his ailing wife and growing brood. Temptation gnaws at him as he sees piles of dough on drug busts.Cheadles Tango leads a double life as an undercover drug officer desperate to make a long-promised promotion and leave the dangerous assignment behind. But when his bosses demand he give up recently paroled drug lord Chaz (Wesley Snipes back in a decent role at last) his jailhouse protector Tango finds his loyalties conflict.Gere disappoints as veteran street cop Eddie a burnout who is counting down the days to his retirement. His story is the least evolved of the three and Gere seems to be a reluctant participant. Do we really need another storyline of a broken-down boozing cop and hooker with a heart of gold?Violent and almost cartoonish in its use of blood Brooklyns Finest underwent some editing since its premiere at Sundance a year ago most notably a change to the ending.

""Brooklyns Finest"" gets rolling with an early scene featuring a dejected police officer who begins his day with a shot of whiskey and an apparent game of Russian roulette. I shivered with recognition as this is exactly how my mornings get started on days when I know Im going to have to see an Ethan Hawke movie. Hawkes role of badass Italian-American cop (""Sal Procida"" -- really?) cries out for a young Al Pacino. When you cant get a Pacino and go with Hawke its a little like reasoning ""I couldnt get the Escalade so I settled for a Schwinn."" I picture Hawke asking his director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"" and many flops) for permission to hammer away at a severe outer-borough accent. And grease back his hair. And rock a tough-guy goatee. ""Can I wear a big gold cross on a chain?"" Sure. ""Can I be shirtless and/or clad in a wife-beater most of the time?"" OK. ""I want to play shattering internal anguish with torqued-up features and an-about-to-burst-into tears frown."" Uh well youre supposed to be a rough-edged bastard not an anorexic college sophomore majoring in histrionics. ""Please?"" Er whatever dude. PHOTOS BROOKLYNS FINEST PREMIERES IN MANHATTAN When Hawke shows us the giant tat of St. Michael that takes up his entire back were reminded of that old fashion adage Before you go out for the night remove one accessory. Clearly both he (and the movie) think tarting themselves up is the only way theyre ever going to be attractive. Thanks to the spew of chest wounds and the clatter of small-arms fire the movie is an entertaining piece of trash that isnt as bad as ""Pride and Glory"" and brings more action than ""We Own the Night."" But it falls way short of ""Training Day"" and isnt even in the same genus as ""The Wire"" from which it borrows several actors. They all come across as cartoon avatars of their characters on the HBO show. Sal is a corrupt undercover cop who is looking for drug dealers to rip off so he can buy a better house for his growing family. Hes so poor he lives literally underneath an elevated train as though sharing a real estate agent with Alvy Singers family the one that lived below the roller coaster in Coney Island. His story operates in parallel to two other cops nursing big sorrows of their own. Dugan (Richard Gere) is a career cynic a do-nothing nobody a week short of retirement who seems bothered by his girlfriends habit of dating other guys. Her occupation? Hooker. (Sample dialogue from her ""You gonna speak up or do I have to suck it outta you?"") The redemption train is leaving the station and if hes gonna jump on it hed better move fast. Meanwhile fellow cop Tango (Don Cheadle) who is so good at being undercover that he went to prison in character (um how is that different from actually being incarcerated?) chafes when told by his handler to help bust a gangster Caz (Wesley Snipes) whom he has grown to like while pretending to be his friend. These characters have nothing to do with one another except their borough (at one point two of them literally bump into each other) but they have more in common than the script does with reality. Within a span of little more than a week a New York City cop shoots and kills an honor student another cop causes a kid to go deaf by firing two warning shots inches away from the youths ear (the alleged perp is accused of stealing a candy bar) and a third cop gets shot -- in an incident mentioned solely as a posting on a bulletin board like the weeks lunch menu. Thats all before the finale which features as many traumatic casualties as seasons one through five of ""E.R."" If youre the kind of viewer who thinks drug kingpins dont bother to protect their lairs with security cameras in case a brigade of officers decides to storm the place this ones for you. The blam-blam and ka-pow keep things moving for the ""Scarface"" lover in you and ""Brooklyns Finest"" may well have a future on cable as a drinking game. At one sip per cuss word though few viewers will still be conscious for the ending in which the three cops finally come to the same place each for an entirely different but equally ridiculous reason. The Gere character makes an unexplained U-turn into altruism while Cheadle and Hawkes cops dont even seem cognizant of why you shouldnt just carry out a shooting spree against everyone you dont like. Dont they realize how much paperwork theyll be in for? kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next APs best bets Who will win the Oscars?

Or Police Benevolent Associations either.But its the nonprofessionals hell really be putting off namely the people buying tickets to what is not just a relentlessly violent but relentlessly grim drama about three cops at the end of their ropes. One is an alcoholic suicidal patrolman on the eve of retirement (Richard Gere); one a drug-enforcement officer with family problems (Ethan Hawke); and one an undercover narcotics detective (Don Cheadle) whos torn between duty and the drug kingpin who saved his life in prison (Wesley Snipes). Theyre all at the breaking point. By the end of the movie you may be too without ever having had the least bit of doubt about where this story was going.The misapprehension about ""Brooklyns Finest"" -- which was first shown at Sundance last year and has been heavily edited since -- is that its a movie about police. It isnt Its a movie about movies about police. At no time will the viewer be under the impression that the performers are engaged in anything but a recycling project regurgitating 50 years of corrupt-cop movies. Fuqua is striving for gritty street cred and instead delivers a clone.The limited arena in which he excels is the violence itself. When Sal Procida (Hawke) goes on a raid in the Brooklyn projects -- looking to rip off dealers so he can buy his pregnant asthmatic wife (Lili Taylor) a mold-free house -- the tension is rich the mayhem abrupt. When Clarence Butler a.k.a. Tango (Cheadle) operates among the lowlife coke dealers of Brooklyn or has to negotiate with his equally repugnant superiors (Will Patton and Ellen Barkin who might as well be foaming at the mouth) the atmosphere is volatile. Fuqua like any horror director worth his salt knows when to have the figurative monster jump out of the bushes a gun goes off someone slaps a table the orchestra cranks it up to 11.What Fuqua cant do is get his actors to serve up screenwriter Michael C. Martins dialogue as anything but canned ham. Its not their fault Gere as the gray cynical Eddie Dugan who has spent 22 years as a patrolman does career weariness well; Hawke maintains a desperate wolfish look and Cheadle effectively plays a guy whose nervous system is a snare drum.But when you construct a movie with three moving parts it sort of behooves you to have them work as part of a whole. Fuqua allows his three characters to brush up against each other -- literally in one case when Gere bumps into Tango outside a bodega. But if youre going to allow their stories to play out in such isolation from each other you cant really crosscut from one character to another. The audience will be looking for interrelated consequences and there arent any.If all this corrupt cop stuff were new we might be distracted from the rather pointless bloodshed and moralistic posturing and perhaps most offensively Sals Catholicism which like some artifact from a 1930s James Cagney movie is tossed in among the wreckage in an attempt to create gravitas. Of course religion is often the last refuge of the sinful and desperate and Fuqua seems to qualify.Anderson is a freelance reviewer.Contains violence vulgarity nudity and sex.

Pictures Blurring the line between good and evil Wesley Snipes left and Don Cheadle are part of the ensemble cast. ABOUT THE MOVIEBrooklyns Finest   out of four Stars Don Cheadle Richard Gere Ethan Hawke Wesley SnipesDirectorAntoine FuquaRated R for bloody violence throughout strong sexuality nudity drug content and pervasive languageRunning time Two hours 18 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Brooklyns Finest is more like Hollywoods Most Heavy Handed. Melodramatic and laden with cop-thriller cliches the story set in one of New Yorks toughest precincts is contrived and inauthentic -- and also grisly. The performances are not the problem; the overall story is. Director Antoine Fuqua knows how to make gritty and engrossing cop thrillers as evidenced by 2001s ultra-tense Training Day. But this NYPD saga is less compelling than the average television police procedural. TRAILER Pay a visit to Brooklyn The premise sounds workable Three police officers -- each on a different career path but alike in their states of despair -- wind up at the same crime scene. Will they be redeemed or released from pain? Theres Tango (Don Cheadle) whose undercover work in a violent drug ring is supposed to lead to a more secure desk job. Hes doing good work but is inexplicably mistreated by superiors. A particularly despicable police official (a way-over-the-top Ellen Barkin) taunts Tango snarling racist slurs at him. As his boss (Will Patton) makes promises and reneges on them Tango finds himself bonding with the rings leader Caz (Wesley Snipes) a drug dealer with a heart of gold. And speaking of gilded hearts Richard Gere plays Eddie a burned-out cop paying nightly calls to a kindly hooker (Shannon Kane). She treats him more like a valued employee than a john. Not only does she listen and cluck about his laments (those dissertations being his version of foreplay) but she also buys him a parting gift a gold watch inscribed with a line from a tune sung by Boy George. No it doesnt make any more sense when youre watching it. At the other end of the entanglement spectrum is narcotics officer Sal (Ethan Hawke) a devoted Catholic and father of seven children who goes to confession regularly though hes struggling to stay on the right side of the law. His asthmatic wife (Lili Taylor) is pregnant with twins and growing sicker daily because of the mold in their tiny house. All three officers endure a chaotic week on the force grapple with their conscience and question their values. Its good to see Snipes back on the big screen and the scenes he shares with Cheadle are a highlight. But theres so much unremitting pain such a constant string of calamities in the lives of all the players that the dreariness overshadows the story. Theres a good movie to be made about the wrenching pressures endured and daily risks faced by law enforcement types. But the popular formula needs an inventive angle. Brooklyns Finest like its title is overly familiar. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Starring Ethan Hawke Richard Gere Don Cheadle Ellen Barkin and Wesley Snipes. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. (R. 140 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) For a while ""Brooklyns Finest"" is a sturdy crime drama about three men driven to extremes by police work. Its hard enough to be a cop. Its hard enough to live in Brooklyn. But to be a cop living in Brooklyn thats too much pressure for anybody. Then the movie ... I was going to say ""collapses"" but thats not quite right. It reveals itself as something less than what it seems. Not a star-studded epic of the streets. Not an investigation into the thin line between the cop and criminal mind. But rather a melodrama about three cliches in search of a bloodbath. Even then even at its worst this is a movie without a lull without an obvious break to go get popcorn. It launches three stories at once about men nearing the breaking point and all three men (and stories) are compelling. Ethan Hawke plays a drug squad detective who absolutely must have money to move his family out of the moldy house that is killing his pregnant asthmatic wife. Don Cheadle is an undercover cop cracking up over dueling loyalties. And Richard Gere is a tired pathetic patrol car police officer who is in love with a prostitute. He is also just days away from retirement and we all know just how dangerous that can be. Until the script betrays them - that is not until the last 20-30 minutes or so - the actors bring dimension to these stock characters. Hawke suppresses his naturally openhearted screen personality to take on the manner of a closed-off bitter and angrily flailing man whos becoming desperate. He doesnt just do the Brooklyn accent but assumes an entirely different vibe and in fact our knowledge of Hawkes usual manner informs our perception of the character This fellow could have been a sensitive funny and spontaneous person if only he werent born in the wrong place and had lots of bad things happen to him. As for Cheadle this is an actor who seems incapable of a dishonest moment. As an undercover cop he has the miserable assignment of having to set up a drug dealer (Wesley Snipes) who is intelligent and honorable as far as crooks go. The film marks a return to form for Snipes who holds the screen with the authority of a star and the authenticity of a good character actor. Every so often even a middling movie shows you something new. ""Brooklyns Finest"" has a scene in which the undercover cop brings his mark (Snipes) to meet two other undercover cops who are posing as major movers in the drug world. Director Antoine Fuqua presents the action from Cheadles eyes and to watch it is to realize perhaps for the first time just how tense and awkward such a situation must be for the undercover cop who has been on the case for a while - to sit and have to watch novices playacting roles that theyve only recently assumed. For Gere the opportunities are less exalted but he deserves credit for taking on such an unattractive role and playing it without compromise. Ellen Barkin makes a vivid appearance in a pair of scenes as a police honcho acting like Jane Lynch in ""Glee"" only not funny. And Vincent DOnofrio appears in a necessary cameo This is DOnofrios atmosphere and it would be a waste not to use him. -- Advisory This movie contains violence strong language nudity drug use and simulated sex.

Martin ""Brooklyns Finest"" is an old-fashioned B-movie law-and-order melodrama. What sets it (slightly) apart is its structure braiding together three unconnected plot strands. Richard Gere plays a burned-out beat cop counting down the days until retirement. Don Cheadle is an undercover type whose loyalties become muddled when he must set up a drug runner (Wesley Snipes) who saved his life. Ethan Hawke is a financially strapped member of an anti-drug task force whose raids tempt him with piles of dirty money. Lili Taylor has a thankless stereotypical role as Hawkes sickly pregnant wife and Shannon Kane is a hooker with a heart of gold who tends to Geres psychic bruises. These are flimsy constructs not flesh-and-blood characters. Their escapades are less stories than anecdotes routine cop-show malarkey that is not re-energized by the retelling here. Each foot soldier is struggling with a lost sense of vocation. In unlikely fashion their fates intersect at a squalid housing project where each unknown to the others prowls the corridors his gun drawn aiming to set his world right with an unauthorized use of force. Compared with a real police-force melodrama like Martin Scorseses ""The Departed"" this is a cold unimpassioned construction. The adventures are sometimes interesting; there are stirring chaotic outbursts of violence. But yelling and shooting alone dont engage the imagination and the domestic interludes verge on soap opera. Theres no notion of how these parallel story lines add up in a dramatic sense. Fuquas direction is technically polished but emotionally absent. Id love to see what he could do with a high-octane crime novel by James Ellroy or Richard Price but here he hasnt enough fuel. Instead of zooming like the Pelham express train ""Brooklyns Finest"" plugs along like a tugboat.

But Brooklyns Finest as dark as the muck in the Gowanus Canal takes the familiar stuff of detectives on the take of worn-out veterans whiling their last days with cynical indifference with undercover cops seduced by drugs and gangland brotherhood and weaves a nasty nail-biter of a tale.Directed by Antoine Fuqua whose Training Day elicited fine against-the-grain work from Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke Brooklyns Finest owes much to the New York police dramas of Sidney Lumet Serpico Qamp;A Prince of the City. From a screenplay by first-timer Michael C. Martin (up from Brooklyn housing projects a finalist in a screenwriting contest - hence this script) Fuquas sucker-punch of a picture is taut noir of the first order.Hawke reteams with Fuqua here but this time the actor isnt any idealistic rookie. Hes Sal a desperate narc with five kids and a wife (Lili Taylor) and shes pregnant again - with twins. Hes sunk in debt living in a dilapidated house plagued by wood mold and he skulks off to confession (hes Catholic hes Italian) to tell the priest that hes just done a very bad thing. (How bad? That depends on how you feel about Law amp; Order Criminal Intent hambone Vincent DOnofrio.) And then theres all this drug money lying around. Shouldnt some of it go to him to buy a decent place to live?Cut to Don Cheadle starring as Tango an undercover man with diamond ear studs and a flash penthouse. Tango is so deep into his double life that hes becoming the guy hes supposed to be busting bonding with the areas biggest dealer Caz played with a percolating cool by Wesley Snipes. Weve seen Tango before in decades worth of crime pics (Johnny Depps Donnie Brasco rooted around in this dilemma of duplicity powerfully) but Cheadles urgency and uncertainty feel real. As he tells his departmental handler (Will Patton) he needs to get out fast or else hes going to be lost.And then theres Eddie (Richard Gere) the 65th precincts tired troubled veteran. Hes got seven days left before retirement and not much more than his bottle of Irish whiskey (he keeps it bedside) and a dead-end relationship with a hooker (Shannon Kane) to look forward to. Told to partner with a new recruit for the last week on the job Eddie is to put it mildly a reluctant mentor. And when a racially charged argument in a corner bodega gets out of control well . . . things are not good.The title Brooklyns Finest is drowning in irony of course but Fuquas moves are less obvious His film is classical and gritty his violence makes you want to duck and run.

"Brooklyns Finest movie review Performances elevate story of cops in conflict |       NJ.com comments Brooklyns Finest movie review Performances elevate story of cops in conflict Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on March 04 2010 at 344 PM updated March 04 2010 at 401 PM View/Post Comments Phillip V. CarusoWesley Snipes and Don Cheadle star in Overture Films ""Brooklyns Finest.""One cop is burnt out a week from retirement drunk and disheveled and literally counting the days until he can pack it in. One cop is tapped out with big bills a tiny house a pregnant wife -- and eyeing the drug money lying around at every raid. One cop is deep undercover and pained by all the conflicted loyalties and living breathing lies the work entails. They are ironically ""Brooklyns Finest."" Or maybe not so ironically.Brooklyns Finest (R) Overture (133 min.) Directed by Antoine Fuqua. With Richard Gere Ethan Hawke Don Cheadle Wesley Snipes. Now playing in New Jersey. Stephen Whittys Rating Three stars Ratings note The film contains gory violence sexual situations nudity strong language and substance abuse.Because as Antoine Fuquas movie goes on we see that no matter how confused these mens private lives have become theyre all still cops risking their lives for each other. And for us. Fuqua is a flashy filmmaker who thinks big both literally and emotionally. He lost out on the chance to do ""American Gangster"" when his plans exceeded the studios budget. His ""Training Day"" probably pushed its melodramatic plot a little further than it should. Those tendencies are all here too and only slightly under better control. ""Brooklyns Finest"" is a long and emotional movie and one that doesnt make any compromises to try to win a larger audience. Its close-to-retirement cop is a mess with a taste for Irish-whiskey eye-openers and a druggy hooker girlfriend. The streety dialogue of the undercover operative and the thugs around him is so thick with mumbled slang its as hard to follow as a cranked-up suspect. You figure thats exactly the way Fuqua wants it too as he stubbornly shows off a style that encompasses painfully slow tracking shots jarringly different film stocks and graphic violence (bullets just dont puncture bodies but punch through them in geysers of blood). But the drama still connects. While its true that the characters here are types -- the frazzled family man the tortured undercover agent the just-punching-a-clock loser -- Fuqua gets some great actors to inhabit them. Not perhaps Ethan Hawke who co-starred in Fuquas ""Training Day."" Hes supposed to be a devoted traditional outer-borough Catholic but Hawkes scraggly face jittery delivery and full-out tattoos make him look less like a police officer than one of the perps hes pursuing. But the terrific Don Cheadle -- who has perhaps the saddest gaze in the movies -- is quietly haunting as the cop who feels closer to the criminals hes investigating than the bosses hes reporting to (particularly Ellen Barkin wickedly fun as a more-macho-than-the-men FBI agent). And Richard Gere does a lot with his character the end-of-his-rope cop taking some wild risks (particularly in the graphic eccentric and alternately tender and tawdry sex scenes with his lover a busy gal who doesnt even have time to shower between clients). Theres nothing here we havent seen before perhaps either in the recent rash of boys-in-blue movies (""We Own the Night"" ""Pride and Glory"") or well-worn old classics (""Prince of the City"" ""Serpico"" and Geres own ""Internal Affairs""). But the actors mostly deliver (particularly Wesley Snipes back in a good movie after a long straight-to-DVD absence). The urban locations are all authentic; Michael C. Martins script cleverly references real-life incidents. And even as hes serving up cliches Fuqua remembers to smartly throw in a few surprises. So no as far as cop pictures go the ""Finest"" doesnt deserve its own superlative. But its still pretty good -- and often as fast and real and explosive as a bullet.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + Brooklyns Finest is a billy-club sandwich three separate cop dramas piled one on top of the other separated by layers of dramatic cheese and compressed until the condiments run together. If that doesnt sound very appetizing it isnt at least not over the course of an entire meal. But the ingredients are promising and you can chew on the movie a good hour before you hit gristle.A stressed NYPD lawman is at the center of each interwoven plot strand and two out of the three leading actors do their damnedest to draw us in. Sal (Ethan Hawke) a member of Brooklyns rough-and-tumble antidrug squad is a family man in an ever-tightening financial squeeze. When we meet him he already has one foot over the line and is contemplating full surrender to corruption. Hawke his features beginning to ravage with age convinces us of the mans escalating despair; Sals a trapped rat deciding which limb to gnaw off.One of the drug lords hes tracking turns out to be a cop deep undercover. Tango (Don Cheadle) has spent so many months building a street rep in jail and out that hes beginning to forget why hes there. The more his superior officer (Will Patton) refuses to bring him in from the cold the more Tango despairs that hell cave in to his demons and Cheadle uses those big bleak eyes of his to toggle between sorrow and rage.The films weak link is Eddie a loser beat cop - burnt-out boozy shunned by his colleagues - who has one week to go before tossing in the towel and retiring. Hes played in a remarkable feat of miscasting by Richard Gere. Two decades ago Gere resuscitated his career as an extremely bad cop in 1990s ""Internal Affairs and the surprise back then was that no one thought the pretty boy had it in him. This is different Eddies a nebbish a nobody and Gere was born to strut. In the scenes where the character shocks rookies with his workaday cynicism you just dont feel the bile in his belly.Thats three main characters in active despair - the movies an emotional wake. Yet where individual scenes and dilemmas convince the whole of ""Brooklyns Finest feels increasingly cooked up. It comes to us from director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day) and writer Michael C. Martin both of whom seem to be aiming for the outer borough existentialism of a filmmaker like James Gray (""The Yards ""We Own the Night) who himself is working from the urban template of Sidney Lumet classics like ""Serpico and ""Qamp;A. At this point the toners running out of the copier and ""Brooklyns Finest turns contrived just when it should be charging ahead to a furious climax.Its furious all right but diffuse; Im not giving anything away to say the three story lines ultimately dont intersect in any meaningful way. The movie was 12 minutes longer and quite a bit darker at last years Sundance Film Festival but the issue was never its downer of an original ending but how it got you there.A New York cop movie has to earn its grit over the long haul and despite some enjoyably hammy performances by Ellen Barkin (as a federal prosecutor) Wesley Snipes (ragged but right as Tangos jailhouse brother) Brian F. OByrne (as Sals Jiminy Cricket) and Lili Taylor (beatifically wasted as Sals wife) ""Brooklyns Finest feels written rather than observed.Whats missing is the assurance of tone that a Lumet would provide. Is it supposed to be comic that Sal has an apparently limitless number of children? Is Eddies final redemption heroic or ironic? Your guess is as good as mine. Unfortunately thats not good enough.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet The perfectly adequate cop drama Brooklyns Finest would feel awfully derivative even without a cast mostly consisting of the Morally Ambiguous Police-Movie All-Stars. Seemingly half the gritty undercover thrillers of the past 25 years are represented. For those keeping track at home Finest stars Internal Affairs Richard Gere New Jack Citys Wesley Snipes (playing of all things a charismatic larger-than-life drug dealer) Sea Of Loves Ellen Barkin and Traitors Don Cheadle in a film that reunites one of the leads (Ethan Hawke) and director (Antoine Fuqua) of Training Day. To quote Yogi Berra its deja vu all over again. Hawke makes the transition from playing a bullied cop having a bitch of a first day in Training Day to starring as a dirty cop whos respected by his colleagues and superiors even though hes racked up a conspicuous body count. No matter the cost to his soul Hawke desperately pursues enough money to move his ill wife (Lili Taylor) and family out of their mold-infested house. Cheadle co-stars as a moody tormented undercover agent asked to bring down recently released drug kingpin Snipes an old friend who helped him out of a bind in prison. And silver fox Gere plays an aging dispirited veteran pressured to help his department save face by lying after his rookie partners mistake leaves a teenager seriously injured. From the moment Gere is introduced waking up to whiskey for breakfast Brooklyns Finest segues smoothly and slickly from one cliche to another. When its established that Gere is but days away from retirement the film skirts self-parody; it wouldnt be out of place for him to grouse that hes getting too old for this shit. Fuqua stretches 90 minutes worth of material to a heavily padded 140 but hes blessed with a cast far better than the TV-ready script deserves especially a smolderingly intense Cheadle as a cop rotting away from the inside. Brooklyns Finest was one of the big sales at Sundance last year. Movies that score big Sundance paydays tend to be either so great their potential is obvious to everyone or incredibly commercial genre films. Fuquas star-studded Finest fits one of those criteria and not because its a towering masterpiece.

Comments Brooklyns Finest 2010 If there were any more cops on the edge in this arrhythmic ham-fisted crime drama Brooklyn would need a bigger edge. Ethan Hawke is a hard-charging narc whos desperate to move his kids and pregnant wife (Lily Taylor) out of their toxic bungalow; Richard Gere is an alcoholic patrolman battling embers of decency seven days before retirement; and Don Cheadle is an undercover agent whose identification with a drug lord (Wesley Snipes) is beginning to outweigh his loyalty to the badge. Eventually they all wind up within bullet range of one another but it takes 140 minutes. Director Antoine Fuqua has come a long way down since Training Day. R.

In voiceover we hear a peculiar New York accent telling how he got off on a DUI arrest because he had been fleeing from Mob thugs. movie review Brooklyns Finest Bad Director Antoine Fuqua. Cast Richard Gere Don Cheadle Ethan Hawke Wesley Snipes. Rating R for bloody violence throughout strong sexuality nudity drug content and pervasive language. RELATED Bad movie cops Spotlight Don Cheadle Spotlight Ethan Hawke Spotlight Wesley Snipes ""Thats a true story"" he insists. Inside the car the accent is Vincent DOnofrio in one of those great character bits he used to do before he started his Olympic scenery chewing on ""Law amp; Order Criminal Intent."" Its a short role. As soon as he gets to the punch line he takes a bullet to the head from dirty cop and lapsed Catholic Ethan Hawke who scoops up a bag of cash and scurries away. At no point will Hawke or any of his big-name co-stars disappear into their roles in ""Brooklyns Finest."" Its not that the acting is bad but the film directed by Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") and written by first-timer Michael C. Martin takes its arty ambitions so seriously that the audience simply cant. And so the characters remain Detective Hawke Officer Richard Gere and Don Cheadle an undercover cop posing as a high-level drug dealer. Their parallel story lines are traced in film that pretends to the thoughtful intricacy of ""Crash"" the gritty realism of ""The Wire"" and the stylish intensity (and high body count) of ""The Departed."" Really its just another collection of noir-lite cliches. Hawke is racking up clandestine felonies trying to gather enough cash for a down payment on a house. His asthmatic wife suffers from the mold in their ramshackle abode but his selfless motives cant wash the blood off his hands. (Thats literal blood on his hands from that bag of money. ""Brooklyns Finest"" is big on obvious visual symbolism.) Gere is a uniformed officer checking off the days till his retirement. (Again literally on a calendar hanging in his locker.) We first meet him sitting bolt upright to his alarm. He reaches for a shot of whisky then sticks his revolver in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Nothing in the chamber. Finally there is Detective Cheadle whos been impersonating a gangster so long he is no longer sure of his loyalties; it doesnt help that he cant trust his handlers in the department who like to shout things like ""You think youre a tough guy?"" Unfortunately the character is a lot less interesting than DiCaprios in ""The Departed"" and Cheadle shows little rapport with his kingpin buddy Wesley Snipes. To add some street cred the cast includes a few alumni of HBOs ""The Wire"" including Michael K. Williams (Omar) and Hassan Johnson (Wee-Bey) as drug enforcers. There is also a subplot about community protests over a case of police brutality which only seems to raise the thematic stakes. Instead it is just another filmic device like the deep shadows and oversaturated colors of the cinematography and the tense ambient soundtrack. Without ever giving the audience a sense of who these characters are or why theyre worth caring about ""Brooklyns Finest"" moves inexorably painstakingly toward its triple climax in which the three stories will converge and diverge in ways that dont quite explain why they were all part of the same movie in the first place. Fuqua tries to create the illusion of meaning by copycatting the style and techniques of better directors but he cant save the naked emperor of the script.

"Brooklyns Finest | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; brooklyn-s-finest ) Brooklyns Finest (United States 2010) March 02 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli With Brooklyns Finest director Antoine Fuqua and screenwriter Michael C. Martin use the ensemble approach of Crash to tell the minimally entwined stories of three Brooklyn cops all of whom have reached a crossroads of one kind or another. Stories like this are notoriously difficult to tell and almost impossible to tell well and various problems arise to keep Brooklyns Finest from escaping the orbit of mediocrity. The script is hampered by a sluggish beginning and an over-reliance upon police movie clichA(c)s. Nearly every move and motive has been lifted directly from the stockroom of cop film standards. Fuqua develops the atmosphere with sufficient grit to generate a degree of narrative drive and momentum during the final 30 minutes but it takes an inordinate amount of time to get to that point and its debatable whether the payoff is worth the two-plus hours invested to arrive at the finish line. Eddie (Richard Gere) is a veteran cop facing retirement with the same lack of enthusiasm evident in his approach to each new day. The only thing that matters to him is getting through each shift alive so he can take a long sip from a half-full glass and spend some time being serviced by his prostitute girlfriend (Shannon Kane). Its not a fulfilling life and when his hotshot partner calls him a coward for his unwillingness to go out on a limb the words hit home. Eddie soon faces a choice between fading into oblivion and doing something that will really make a difference. Tango (Don Cheadle) is under cover. His mission is to bring down drug lord Caz (Wesley Snipes) but theres a problem. He owes Caz his life and finds himself caught in the vise of conflict between duty and friendship. In the end he recognizes he will be forced to make a decision and understands that the repercussions will be long and lasting regardless of which way he turns. Either he will betray Caz or jeopardize his career and reject the promotion he has worked long and hard for. Sal (Ethan Hawke) a devout Catholic who attends confession and doesnt use birth control finds himself in dire straits. With two sons and two daughters under his roof and twins on the way he needs to find a bigger house. His wife Angela (Lili Taylor) doesnt work and its tough enough meeting his current bills on his paltry cops salary not to mention finding the money for a downpayment on his dream house. So Sal begins making occasional forays to the dark side to increase his hidden stash of dirty dollars. After all if there is cash lying in the open at a drug bust whos going to notice if some goes missing? As Sals desperation grows his actions become more bold and he puts not only his job and reputation on the line but his life as well. Eddies story is the least interesting and the most contrived. Although Gere is surprisingly good as the morally bankrupt cop searching for redemption the path trodden by the character is predictable and obvious. Its hard to feel for Eddie when we recognize where his plot arc is taking him. Cheadles Tango is more interesting but the script cheats at the end by using a plot device to remove the core of his moral dilemma. The climax for this character is forced; its the kind of thing that would only happen in a movie. Finally Sal comes across as pretty unlikeable and whiney which makes it difficult to sympathize with his situation. As his buddy points out he has it all - a loving wife a happy family and the respect of his peers. The trajectory of his character is the most tragic of the three but also the most difficult for which to develop sympathy. However it should be noted that Ethan Hawke gives an excellent performance as a man on the psychological edge. Its evident that Fuquas goal is to do something meaningful with a familiar genre but his decision to employ so many stale conventions is one of the things that dooms the effort. How many times have we seen dirty cops attend confession? Or undercover officers agonize over turning against a ""friend""? Or a burnt-out veteran putting the barrel of a gun in his mouth? Too much of what transpires during the course of Brooklyns Finest has appeared in other better cop movies. Often this seems like a ""greatest hits"" compilation and it doesnt help that the running length is split into three limiting the amount of time allotted to character development for each of the three principals. At least the acting is uniformly solid. Fine performances abound and not just from the leads. Wesley Snipes who hasnt been in much of note in nearly a decade settles into this role as if he was born for it. Vincent DOnofrio is terrific in the one-scene cameo that gets the movie off to a rousing start. And Ellen Barkin is unforgettable as the foul-mouthed tough-as-nails FBI agent who makes life hell for Tango. Its in large part because of the acting that the derivative nature of Brooklyns Finest is sometimes obscured. Ultimately the film isnt uninteresting. It takes some effort to stick with it. As effective as Fuqua is at generating tension during the final act (he frequently uses cross-cutting for this purpose) he has trouble sustaining interest in the earlier mandatory ""getting to know them"" segments. Brooklyns Finest has a more compelling second half but is the payoff worth the investment? Thats questionable and the answer may lie in how enamored one is with the genre. Fuquas portrait of Brooklyn is brutal and gritty; if only his characters were as vivid.

Martin; Runtime (in minutes) 125; MPAA Rating R; Distributor Overture Posted March 3 2010 -- 1200 AM EST The irony of calling a movie about compromised gentlemen of the New York City Police Department Brooklyns Finest aint exactly what youd call subtle. But then neither is this heated-to-boiling melodrama a sustained eruption of bullets flying hookers hooking and cops copping to all sorts of crappy behavior for reasons were meant to think of as reasonable since they work one of NYCs meanest precincts. Tango (Don Cheadle) working undercover and bonding with a big-time drug dealer (Wesley Snipes) has burrowed in too far with the bad guys. Sal (Ethan Hawke) a Catholic who struggles with his conscience in the confessional booth dabbles in dirty money to support his asthmatic wife (Lili Taylor) and their ever-expanding litter of kids. Burned-out Eddie (Richard Gere) a week away from retirement awakens each morning with a slug of booze and thoughts of suicide. The appearance of smartphones suggests were in the present; the set decor suggests Hill Street Blues. The pairing of Cheadle and Snipes begs a future in which we get to see these two power players together in something substantive. Under the circumstances even a stereotypical cop who loved doughnuts would have been welcome comic relief. But director Antoine Fuqua has no time for anything but pain; hes as obsessed with corruption as he was in his 2001 badge-and-gun opera Training Day in which Hawke played a rookie on a steep ? learning curve. The script for Brooklyns Finest comes from first-timer Michael C. Martin who grew up in the Brooklyn projects. Its built of rigidly interlocking calamities and the movie revels in the cartooniest details of street life. Ellen Barkin provides unexpected diversion in a madwoman cameo as the PDs brassiest brass. But otherwise the cliches keep coming. Wouldnt you know it Eddies favorite prostitute (Shannon Kane her fine nekkid bod available for close inspection) has a heart of gold? Only in Brooklyn kids only in Brooklyn.

It was once a New York thrill of course having ones visage plastered all about town announcing a show or product launch. Yet in the days since Sept. 11-as the citys bus stops subway walls and plywood walkways have been blanketed with thousands of photos of other absent less famous residents-those promotional posters have felt suddenly worthless and embarrassing especially to people in them like Vincent DOnofrio. ""As an actor I feel completely insignificant"" Mr. DOnofrio 42 said on a recent afternoon. He was sitting on a park bench in Tompkins Square Park his long blue-jeaned legs stretched out before him. ""I feel completely useless. I feel like a fool. I feel that what I do for a living has so little to do with anything that is good for us as a people. I cant believe that anything I have done or will do as far as my acting will ever help anybody or ever serve us in any way that is helpful. I just feel silly."" Mr. DOnofrio fumbled with a pack of Camel Lights and lit one. The air outside was damp muggy. ""I was supposed to do the Today show next week and I have pushed everything back"" he said. ""I was supposed to do lots of press for [ Law amp; Order Criminal Intent ] right before it came on but I told them I cant do it I feel silly. I feel silly trying to sell anything on TV. I cant do it. Its going to have to wait until I can do it and I dont know if it will affect the show. The truth is I dont care. Im contracted to do this show and Ill do it but this thing is bigger than a contract and bigger than any of us can fathom."" Just a month before Mr. DOnofrio had been in a different mood. The tall brown-haired baby-faced Bensonhurst native-who has co-starred in films such as Full Metal Jacket Ed Wood and Men in Black -has never been a Robin Williams-style extrovert but back on a rainy day in August in his apartment he talked excitedly about his new television show about being back in New York about being closer to his family about a movie he was developing about the late rock critic Lester Bangs. He also spoke that day about a planned Law amp; Order miniseries that would integrate all the performers from the three Law amp; Order shows. The miniseries was about a bioterrorist attack on New York (plotted by Osama bin Laden it turned out). Mr. DOnofrio promised the miniseries would be scary. ""I cant really talk about it"" he said. Now it was more than a month later and that miniseries idea was of course kaput. And Mr. DOnofrio-an actor who had spent much of his career trying decidedly not to be an actor schmuck resisting fame resisting big paydays-felt like well a bit of a schmuck. It all seemed so dumb. As a kid he had worked as a bouncer alongside dozens of New York City firemen; in recent years hed worked out with a local fireman friend when he needed to be in shape for a role. That fireman was O.K. he said. But others .... ""This [movie] company they want to meet with me about a film tonight"" Mr. DOnofrio said. ""I dont know what to talk to them about."" Mr. DOnofrio said that in the aftermath of Sept. 11 he had considered leaving the city with his wife and young son. He said if it werent for his deal to do Law amp; Order  they might have left moved someplace else. ""Its something so unfathomable-to have no control over whether your child is going to survive or not"" he said. ""The people who were on their planes with their children sitting next to them flying to their deaths. A couple with a 2-year-old kid. I cant even .... "" Mr. DOnofrio paused. ""I make a living because of my imagination but I cant even come close to imagining what the hell that would be like."" A man approached Mr. DOnofrio and bummed a cigarette. Behind a group of men listened to a portable radio loudly playing thrash metal. ""The reality of it is that I am involved in the entertainment business"" Mr. DOnofrio said. ""Im sure that people who like these shows are going to be entertained by it-and I hope they are. If it takes their mind off what has happened to us all the better. But I am not going to pretend that right now I am enthusiastic about my career. All of my attention and all of my focus right now is on our country and what our next move is going to be."" Mr. DOnofrio smiled. ""You wanted to interview me after this attack"" he said. ""And this is what you get. ""There is no way for me ... not to feel affected by this thing"" he continued. ""Talk to me three months from now and hopefully America will be in a better situation. Im going to feel differently; Im going to be gung-ho about what I do for a living again. We all are hopefully."" -Jason Gay Raging Onward With the Bull Its fair to say that on the evening of Sept. 29 the last thing many people in New York were looking for was a fistfight. And yet there we were 19000 of us packed into Madison Square Garden to watch the young middleweight champion Felix (Tito) Trinidad take on Bernard Hopkins a 36-year-old ex-con from North Philadelphia. Originally scheduled for Sept. 15 the fight had sensibly been postponed but two weeks later one still had a nagging slightly skeezy feeling-that is to say more than the usual one associated with professional boxing-watching men club each other for money and fame. These were supposed to be reflective quieter less grandiose times. In other words not Don King time. Before the main event the Garden was restless subdued. Because of security precautions Mr. Trinidads sizable passionate fandom had its usual stable of horns and noisemakers seized at the door dampening Tito Nations usual Mardi Gras-like atmospherics. Sharkskin suits and white fedoras normally so ample were tough to find. Even the ring girls-the half-naked Amazons who strut around between rounds numbered placards high above their heads-seemed a little lost miscast. (All thongs though were appropriately black.) ""There is something missing"" said Jake LaMotta the 1949-1951 former middleweight champion portrayed by Robert De Niro in the film Raging Bull. He wore a black cowboy hat with a black shirt black pants and a blazer the color of buttered popcorn. ""I think in the back of peoples minds they dont have the energy to be happy all the time."" Still the Bull advised moving forward. ""Its got to start sometime"" he said. ""You got to start doing things. You cant go on forever like this. I think its good for the public. Its good for the people who went through a lot of torment and agony and stuff like that. Its not a pleasant thing."" Mr. LaMotta had watched Sept. 11 from his apartment on the East Side on 57th Street. ""I could see the smoke"" he said. ""And I was watching it all day on TV for days. They had the same thing over and over again."" Tonight Mr. LaMotta liked Mr. Trinidad. ""Hes got a style a little like Sugar Ray Robinson-a very colorful fighter throws a lot of punches takes a good punch"" he said. ""Same with the other guy. I think its going to be a toss-up."" As fight time approached other celebrities turned up in the crowd-Denzel Washington Matt Damon Jay-Z the former champion Evander Holyfield. Unannounced a troupe of firefighters and police officers crossed the Garden floor and the arena erupted into a two-minute wave of applause. Even sportswriters-a weirdly prissy bunch who wouldnt clap in the press box if their mothers scored the winning run in Game 7-rose and applauded. Shortly after 11 p.m. Messrs. Hopkins and Trinidad appeared the former to Ray Charles singing ""God Bless America"" and accompanied by an attendant brandishing a dusty firemans helmet. Mr. Trinidad too nodded to the occasion arriving in a policemans hat over his standard white headband and sequined Puerto Rican-flag outfit. The fight itself was a knockout-Mr. Hopkins a severe underdog baited the elegant Mr. Trinidad all night crouching and luring him into the ropes before unleashing furious uppercuts that caught the 28-year-old champions jaw and bolted his young legs to the floor. Mr. Trinidad hung tough even dancing a bit in the ring like Ray Leonard but it was more of a delaying tactic than showmanship Mr. Hopkins simply bided his time waiting to unleash. He finished the job in the 12th with a series of blows and a body nudge that sent the now ex-champ sprawling and Mr. Trinidads father into the ring calling it finished. In the darkness and clamor Jake LaMotta rose and went home an aging flash of color in a gray night. -Jason Gay Comment Filed under Jake LaMotta Jason Gay The New York World Vincent DOnofrio Trending Now Space Radiation Devastated the Lives of Apollo Astronauts Business amp; Tech How to Read People Five Secrets Backed by Research Business amp; Tech How Philosophy Can Change Your Life Business amp; Tech Meet Dolce amp; Gabbanas Secret Weapon To Reaching Generation Z Style amp; Design Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2010/culture/law-disorder,200,brooklyn'sfinest27,brooklyn'sfinest,observer

Seen it. Seen it. And seen it. Disappointing since Brooklyns Finest is from Antoine Fuqua who directed Denzel right into an Oscar for Training Day. The script is by a first-timer named Michael C. Martin who wrote a movie that sounds like every other movie. Which would be forgivable if Fuqua had tweaked it enough to at least acknowledge its antecedents--to at least wink--or had turned this sleepy sucker up to 11. Also Hawke who spends a lot of time glowering and sulking usually while smoking is easily the least Sal-looking character in the history of the movies.

Gleefully if pointlessly violent the facetiously titled ""Brooklyns Finest"" ensnares a first-rate cast in a dramatic dragnet for a fugitive moral lesson about street-weary policemen -- whose fates may leave auds not just befuddled but ticked off. The performances are uniformly good but ""Training Day"" helmer Antoine Fuqua seems to lack the maturity as a filmmaker to match his casting or his budget. Senator and Sony who bought the pics rights are hoping the stars will attract crowds but the films relentlessly bleak vision is tough to love. The filmmakers reportedly have already decided to excise ending which drew gasps and laughs at the dramas Sundance premiere. Not that ""Brooklyns Finest"" is drab or visually lazy. It is however a narrative muddle. Three main characters are introduced First Eddie (Richard Gere) wakes up in the morning and puts a gun barrel in his mouth rehearsing for suicide. Second Sal (Ethan Hawke) -- after chatting amiably in a car with what we assume is a fellow gangster (Vincent DOnofrio) -- shoots the guy in the face and robs him of a bag of cash. And third a very slick very dangerous Tango (Don Cheadle) is cruising Brownsville clearly at ease with thug life orchestrating the running of big bags of coke. But all three are actually cops serving at various levels of the NYPD hierarchy. And all three are poster boys for the corrupting influence of easy money no respect and a vision of the future thats begging them to sell out. The three are ships in the night Sal the tactical drug-raid cop doesnt know the supposed drug dealer Tango; Tango wouldnt know Eddie who is about to retire after 22 years as a patrolman. They remain oblivious to each others existence -- although Fuqua does have them bump into each other unknowingly upping the apprehension about what we know is going to happen The three will converge and its going to be ugly. How ugly one cant quite anticipate. But its the easy facile aspects of the script (by Michael C. Martin and Brad Caleb Kane) that are more surprising than anything else. ""Brooklyns Finest"" manages to elicit sympathy for three characters who on the surface at least are insects Sal is itching to rip off some big-time drug op but only because he lives in a house riddled with mold thats killing his asthmatic wife (Lili Taylor) whos also having twins. Eddie has been on the street so long he no longer cares about much of anything especially the people hes sworn to protect. But within him is a reservoir of decency that Gere hints at deftly. Tango is on the fast track to a promotion but to get it he needs to lure Caz (Wesley Snipes) the man who saved his life in prison back into a life of crime. (Ellen Barkin as the higher-up orchestrating the sting is vicious and brilliant.) The pic isnt exactly Greek tragedy but you can see thats where it would like to be heading. Instead its more like ""Hamlet"" -- the ending at least with enough blood and corpses to fill a housing project. The only thing missing is a point which Fuqua circles for two hours without landing. Production values are good although the real-life East Brooklyn locales occasionally receive more enhancement than they need.
