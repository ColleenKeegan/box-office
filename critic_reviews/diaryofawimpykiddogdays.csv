Summer is under way and after Dad (Steve Zahn) unplugs the family video-game console Greg (Zachary Gordon) and his awkward pals spend their vacation sneaking into country clubs testing their outdoorsmanship and trying hard not to look like dorks in front of their crushes. A series of excessively antic broad-comic set pieces amps things up to an annoying degree but director David Bowers transforms tweendoms tiny struggles into an amusingly enormous drama. Viewers enduring early adolescence or those grappling with its psychic scars will recognize the honesty in the comic humiliation.

For Greg that would be playing videogames all day every day. But to keep Dad happy he pretends to get a job at the country club where the girl he likes and his best friend (Robert Capron) are members. Though often self-centered and conniving Greg remains a likable kid and the movie entertains by pulling off over-the-top scenarios that set up digestible life lessons for youngsters.

Its the latest installment in what now forms a lightly likable trilogy of films based on Jeff Kinneys Wimpy Kid books notebook-paper-doodle-illustrated young-adult epistolary novels that record middle schooler Greg Heffleys navigation of the multitudinous perils of a typical suburban childhood and its prefab identity options. If theres a secret to the popularity of Kinneys books its that they understand kids healthy conspiratorial disrespect for everything the adult world encourages them to take an interest in while never settling into lazy Garfield cynicism. Summer break is the pertinent problem this time around. Against the wishes of his father Greg conspires to spend every day inside playing video games but has to whip up an illusion of responsible activity as a smoke screen including a fake country-club job and a stint with the Boy Scouts. Zachary Gordon practices his well-honed wince as Greg leading a returning ensemble cast that includes Robert Capron as amiable butterball best friend Rowley Jefferson and Steve Zahn used to good advantage here as the oft-hyperventilating patriarch Frank Heffley. The humor ranges from broad shame-based comedy (swim trunks lost on the high-dive board) to moments of subtler discomfort like a seaside vacation with the Jeffersons that comes to a dead halt around a touchy-feely game called ""I Love You Because.""Film Details Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days RatingPG GenreComedy Running Time94 More Info Trailer Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Photo Credit Fox advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT Seventh grade is over but Greg Heffleys summer will be no vacation. BOTTOM LINE The third ""Wimpy Kid"" movie is the series weakest but it still has a good heart some funny moments and genuine respect for its characters. CAST Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Devon Bostick Peyton List LENGTH 134 The ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" franchise adapted from Jeff Kinneys illustrated books has carved out a niche Its the only current movie series about an everyday kid living an everyday life. Greg Heffley the flawed but sympathetic hero may occasionally wish for a wizards wand to solve his problem but in the end the job falls to him. Old-fashioned and small in scale the movies sometimes feel like after-school specials from a bygone era which is part of what makes them so endearing. The third and newest entry ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" combines two of Kinneys books into one loose collection of story lines. During the summer after seventh grade Greg (Zachary Gordon) begins sneaking into a country club to get closer to pretty Holly Hills (Peyton List). To prevent his parents from sending him to a punitive boarding school Greg pretends to get a summer job. And to keep that lie going Greg does whatever his blackmailing teenage brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) demands. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? The overstuffed script while mostly funny and engaging buries some of the franchises best assets particularly Robert Capron who stole the first movie as Gregs gooey-hearted friend Rowley and Bostick who shined in the second as a sneering punk with a soft side. ""Dog Days"" ostensibly focuses on Gregs strained relationship with his father Frank (Steve Zahn) but the two share only one or two meaningful moments. The biggest disappointment in ""Dog Days"" is the character of Holly Hills an innocuous trophy girl whose best qualities seem to be a pretty smile and the name of a future Playmate. Thats a message the ""Wimpy Kid"" movies dont need to send. But Greg remains a refreshingly average hero a boy trying not to save the world but simply make it through childhood. PLOT Seventh grade is over but Greg Heffleys summer will be no vacation. RATING PG (mildly crude humor) 153 VideoTrailer Dairy of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days CAST Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Devon Bostick Peyton List advertisement | advertise on newsday LENGTH 134 PLAYING AT Area theaters BOTTOM LINE The third ""Wimpy Kid"" movie is the series weakest but it still has a good heart some funny moments and genuine respect for its characters. Making Wimpy Kid softer on screen 129 VideoThe ""Wimpy"" kids are back In adapting Jeff Kinneys ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" books for the screen the filmmakers have sanded down some of lead character Greg Heffleys rougher edges in part because what he says or does to the two-dimensional stick figures around him in a book plays more harshly when hes doing those things to a living person on screen. ""There are things you can get away with on the printed page that are funny that you cant get away with on screen"" said Kinney who left the screenwriting on ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" to Maya Forbes Gabe Sachs and Wallace Wolodarsky but consulted with the filmmakers on all three films. ""I think hes much more subversive in the books than in the movies."" At the same time Greg (played by Zachary Gordon) learns from his cinematic mistakes something that doesnt necessarily happen in the books. ""Youve got an imperfect character and youre trying to make him likable. In a movie you have to see growth because the audience expects it"" Kinney said of how Greg changes on screen. ""They are looking for an emotionally satisfying conclusion and my books are nihilistic in that way. Im not looking for an emotionally satisfying conclusion. Im looking to get a joke on every page."" -- Los Angeles Times VideoTrailer Diary of a Wimpy Kid Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

Hollywoods dog days have indeed arrived with this sloppy third helping of the family-friendly series derived from Jeff Kinneys graphic novels which has racked up 147 million in worldwide ticket sales for the first two films against a reported combined budget of 36 million. This time around eighth-grader Greg (Zachary Gordon who seems to be developing bags under his eyes) is under pressure from his dad (Steve Zahn considered cutting edge a decade ago) to spend the summer doing something other than playing video games. So he lies about having a job at a country club where he passes days in chaste pursuit of a blond airhead (Peyton List). David Bowers who took over direction with the second installment flubs a series of seemingly idiot-proof comic setups at an amusement park on a camping trip and at a Sweet 16 party where our heros bullying musician brother (Devon Bostick) wreaks havoc. Id call ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" harmless if it werent for some totally unnecessary gay-panic jokes that could actually encourage bullying.

Starring Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Devon Bostick Director David Bowers Release Opened Aug 3 2012  Editorial Review Good clean -- if fleeting -- funBy Sean OConnellFriday August 3 2012The ""Wimpy"" kid residing in all of us should find ample heart hearty laughs and heaping helpings of wholesome humiliation in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" the third chapter in what has become a winning family-friendly film franchise. As is the case with any sequel newcomers unfamiliar with either Jeff Kinneys best-selling ""Wimpy Kid"" books or the two movies theyve already inspired will be puzzled by the unusual components fans embrace. Take note Loded Diper is a terrible punk-rock band while Fregley remains the lovably awkward nerd whose personal grooming habits leave a lot to be desired. Champions of the endearing series however can celebrate the fact that the major creative players -- including ""Rodrick Rules"" director David Bowers -- return to ensure that ""Dog Days"" trots down the same humorous paths carved by its predecessors. But my how theyre changing. Fourteen-year-old Zachary Gordon playing put-upon ""Kid"" Greg Heffley for the third time is undergoing the unavoidable growth spurts and vocal octave drops that arrive with puberty. At this rate the next film in the ongoing series will have to be titled ""Diary of a Wimpy Young Adult."" Gregs personal interests also are maturing in an effort to keep up with the franchises preteen demographic. Secret freckles magic shows and the dreaded Cheese Touch are so ""middle school."" Greg and his best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) are ready for eighth grade but not before they fill their summer vacation with video-game marathons pool parties at the neighborhood country club and -- if Gregs lucky -- some one-on-one time with the lovely Holly Hills (Peyton List) his schoolgirl crush. After getting his feet wet on ""Rodrick Rules"" Bowers digs a little deeper into the personality tics of the dysfunctional Heffley clan. A onetime animator himself (his credits include ""An American Tail"" ""FernGully"" and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"") Bowers also makes better use of the rudimentary stick-figure cartoons Kinney weaves throughout his books. They make for clever visual bridges between the seemingly disconnected episodes in the ""Dog Days"" script which was assembled by veteran joke writers Wallace Wolodarsky (""The Simpsons"") and Maya Forbes (""The Larry Sanders Show""). ""Dog Days"" rarely strays from its core mission of imparting valuable life lessons as it reenacts the perils of pre-pubescence. Dependably goofy Steve Zahn adds a fresh layer to the frazzled father Frank Heffley who tries to instill in Greg a proper work ethic. Devon Bostick continues to make older sibling Rodrick an enjoyable screen villain. (His off-key rendition of Justin Biebers hit ""Baby"" also happens to be the funniest ""Dog Days"" scene.) Spending time with Kinneys characters has become an annual treat. But how long can it last? From its opening scene -- in which Greg must maneuver his way through a locker room filled with naked hairy old men -- to a running subplot involving the disposal of baby brother Mannys security blanket -- so much of ""Dog Days"" reminds us that aging is inevitable; we all need to grow up settle down and move beyond the adolescent distraction that brings us such joy. Hollywood too will eventually outgrow this ""Wimpy"" series and move on. Thats a shame. It really captures what it feels like to be a kid.Contains some rude humor.

"Movie review Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-MoviesMovie review Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days stuck in idle modeAfter the first two films in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series based on Jeff Kinneys books the charm has worn off a bit in Dog Days about awkward but endearing middle-schooler Greg Heffley as he pursues a girl and tries to keep his dad off his back.August 02 2012|By Stephanie Zacharek Robert Capron left Zachary Gordon Peyton List in the third ""Diary""... (Diyah Pera Fox )Sometimes the most unassuming kids movies a the ones that dont work too hard to be artistic or educational or worthy a are the smartest.Until now the""Diary of a Wimpy Kid""movies surprisingly well-engineered little comedies based on Jeff Kinneys popular illustrated novels fell into that category. Unfortunately the third picture in the franchise""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days""a which like last years""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules""was directed by David Bowers a ends the series winning streak or at least slows it down to a panting dog-day crawl.Zachary Gordon returns as awkward but endearing Greg Heffley a middle-schooler whos hopelessly entranced with his preternaturally unattainable but also super-nice blond classmate Holly Hills (Peyton List). Summer vacation has arrived and all Greg wants to do is loll around the house playing video games. His father played by Steve Zahn has other ideas expressing a frustrated wish that his son would get outside more and enjoy a ""normal"" boyhood.In an effort to win the affections of his lady love and get his dad off his back Greg becomes entrenched in a lie giving his older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick whos charming in a louche way like a Tiger Beat pinup) ample opportunity to blackmail him.As the anxious adolescent Greg Gordon is still reasonably adorable and on his way to being bodaciously handsome. But that in-between stage is nobodys friend and the fact that Greg is now well past the 11-year-old goofus stage and headed for sullen teenagerhood may explain why some of the charm has worn off.Still the pictures reach never exceeds its grasp and it offers a fair amount of the gross-out stuff kids love. When Greg and his family spend a day at the municipal pool a trek through the mens locker room provides a kids-eye view of the many horrors of aging Greg bears witness to an array of fat rolls hairy backsides and plumbers cracks as well as a comically horrific incidence of toe-picking.""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" is at its best in offhand vignettes like these. And when all else fails its great fun to watch the wonderfully zonked-out Zahn a attired at one point in an endearingly absurd scout leaders uniform a play an authority figure.Hes so boyish he barely seems suited to be a dad a a reminder maybe that adulthood can never fully erase the wimpy kid inside.calendarlatimes.com---------------------------Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog DaysMPAA rating PG for some rude humorRunning time 1 hour 34 minutesPlaying In general release MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSaturdays TV Highlights Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days...July 5 2013Wimpy Kid Greg Heffley isnt your typical summer movie...July 28 2012Movie review Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick RulesMarch 25 2011Diary of a Wimpy KidMarch 19 2010Los Angeles Times bestsellers (hardcover) for March 7 2010March 7 2010MORE STORIES ABOUTMoviesBusinessNot_live_webEntertainmentCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-20120803,0,2856833.story",200,diaryofawimpykiddogdays7,diaryofawimpykiddogdays,latimes

Wimpy has little interest in aging its heroes prematurely.VIDEO The ""Wimpy"" kids are back for Dog DaysMORE First Look Dog DaysLike last years Winnie the Pooh Days is perfectly content in its juvenile nook more interested in fleshing out a books story lines than establishing a commercial tie-in.Days begins with a premise that may seem quaint to parents and outright alien to kids a summer with time to kill.

Unfortunately Gregs dad Frank (the charming Steve Zahn) has a different plan and pressures his son to find a job.Torn between laziness and appeasing his father Greg hatches a pretty reasonable plot tell his father hes working at the country club where buddy Rowley (Robert Capron) can sneak him in as a guest.Days isnt interested in going beyond that premise so dont expect much in terms of kids learning the value of labor first love or sibling relationships. Little Miss Sunshine this isnt.But credit director David Bowers for capturing the more innocent elements of being 12. He touches on crushes but the PG-rated movie never ventures near sexuality.And while Devon Bostick is entering that Hollywood-handsome stage hes still just wide-eyed and pompous enough to convince as Gregs older brother.Gregs character in particular is a throwback hes crazy for girls and music in the I Wanna Hold Your Hand kind of way without the charm or singing talent.It all makes for goofy fun and physical comedy that will have parents rolling their eyes.But thats always been Wimpys point Whats the rush into adulthood?

Credit Diyah Pera/20th Century Fox Studios generally dont like to see the word ""excruciating"" in a movie review. But the makers of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" wont mind seeing it here because thats just what this good-natured if not very ambitious family film is going for.It wants you to feel the pain of the title child Greg (Zachary Gordon) as he goes through one embarrassment after another during an eventful summer and you do. The end-of-school yearbook signing fiasco the tennis court humiliation the camping trip incompetence -- any or for some who had particularly disastrous childhoods all of it might bring a wince of familiarity.The execution isnt great. David Bowers the director allows too much hammy acting. The formula is now pretty well worn -- this is the third movie based on Jeff Kinneys book series. The film is more a patched-together collection of anecdotes than a coherent story and some of Gregs tribulations like fear over a high dive and an amusement-park ride dont seem age-appropriate for a boy who has just finished seventh grade.But Peyton List is charming as Holly the cutie who serves as Gregs romantic interest and a few scenes -- a debacle at a Civil War re-enactment for instance -- have the spark of originality.""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mildly rude humor.

Well Greg Heffley had to start hitting that awkward stage sometime. No doubt acutely aware of this the screen handlers of Jeff Kinneys ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" skip ahead one volume for ""Dog Days"" the third movie (and fourth book) in the series. But they cant keep ahead of their casts puberty curve as the sort of mischief that felt cutely wise-alecky up to this point often just doesnt work here.Zachary Gordon now a teenager is back for another episodic outing as Greg joined once again by second-installment director David Bowers. This time their loose story spine is Gregs scheme to slack his way through summer vacation. Gregs true-to-life dream is to play video games 9 to 5 a plan that his dad (Steve Zahn) puts the kibosh on after a day. So its on to plan B pretending that hes landed a job at the country club where his dorky BFF Rowley (Robert Capron) is a member.Not that there isnt a certain go-getter aspect to it all as Gregs big aim is to get closer to yearlong crush Holly Hills (Peyton List) another club regular. If only Gregs jerk of an older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) didnt immediately spot this as his ticket to sidle up to Hollys sister a lifeguard at the club and snarf down free food.Compared to the first two movie installments this one is uncharacteristically scattershot in the life-lessons department. First its about Greg and his dads need to find common ground so they join a scout troop and go camping. But then never mind that because now its on to the real emotional core the stuff about being truthful. Oh wait check that Lying is forgivable the important thing is that you learn from your mistakes.Among the things that ""Dog Days"" does make clear is that Bostick is the series unsung star. Hes well past his castmates encroaching-adolescence challenges -- at 20 hes gangly in a fully formed way -- and even after three movies his aggressive butt-of-his-own-joke obnoxiousness hasnt gotten old. His feigned pool mishap is a highlight.Contrast this with Gregs own pool mishap which ultimately involves covering up in a pair of girls hot pants and seems to feel even more uncomfortable than intended. The sequence is one of a few tonally odd moments including Rowleys familys creepy-close snack sharing. That one falls just on the right side of the divide between funny ha-ha and funny strange. You wont necessarily feel the same about their invite to have Greg join them in a game called ""I Love You Because."" Again too uncomfortable for family entertainment?What happened to that swell anecdotal relatability? Consider it another sign that its probably time for Gordon to bid ""Wimpy Kid"" adieu.Tom Russo can be reached at trusso2222gmail.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Just how much abuse can one kid take? Middle-schooler Greg Heffley is about to find out in ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" the serviceable third installment in the franchise adapted from Jeff Kinneys bestselling books. Formulaic in adhering to the sitcom-style tone of the first two films pic finds the chronically underappreciated Greg (Zachary Gordon) facing a summer break replete with parental expectations and anxiety over his first crush. Result should like its predecessors satisfy ""Wimpy Kid"" fans but a bigger problem -- what to do when your young actors grow faster than your characters? -- lies ahead for Fox. Kinneys seven ""Wimpy Kid"" books have become essential reading for disenfranchised tweens everywhere; certainly no one these days has had greater success exploring the indignities of adolescence. It was Kinneys first book published in 2003 that coined the enduring catchphrase ""cheese touch"" a shorthand gross-out ""youre it"" now deployed on playgrounds from coast to coast. With a cast and crew culled from the first two pics this third film has accelerated the timeline by blending elements from Kinneys third and fourth books (""The Last Straw"" and ""Dog Days"".) With the author in place as exec producer overseeing a script by Maya Forbes and Wallace Wolodarsky the compression is seamlessly handled. As usual Gordons reliably sardonic narration and Kinneys occasional onscreen animation lend the proceedings some context. In the waning days of seventh grade Greg announces his plans for summer vacation to play a lot of videogames and woo the lovely Holly (Peyton List). But his parents Frank and Susan (Steve Zahn and Rachael Harris) insist he should be more productive. So when Gregs best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) invites him to the country club where Holly teaches tennis Greg opts to pose as an employee there. Mom and Dad seem pleased with his newly industrious streak (and Holly might just think hes cute) but its just a matter of time before Greg accidentally blows his own cover. It doesnt help that Greg brags about his prowess with a racquet but hes mortified to learn that playing Wii Tennis isnt the same as the real thing. Luckily Holly is the understanding type but theres plenty more humiliation ahead as Greg seeks other ways to impress her Struck with fear atop the high dive Greg soon finds hes in way over his head -- and soon somehow swimming without his trunks. Of course Greg hails from a ridiculously dysfunctional family so his parents cant be too hard on him. Much of the humor in ""Dog Days"" springs from the screwball dynamics among the three Heffley boys -- Greg is stuck between teenager Rodrick (Devon Bostick) and toddler Manny (Connor and Owen Fielding) -- and Dads misguided attempts to manage the chaos. When the familys new dog mistakes little Mannys blanket for a chew toy Greg tries to distract him with the pot roast Mom had broiled for dinner inspiring a hilarious if predictably icky turn of events. In a last-ditch attempt to cement their bond and to redress his own adolescent failings Frank decides to enroll Greg in a father-son wilderness explorers camp. The final reel ups the gross-out ante but kids will enjoy the pratfalls and the ever-so-slight possibility of Gregs vindication. Parents will value the fact that there are a few lessons administered throughout while the younger set will appreciate that those lessons are not at all preachy. Tech package is adequate but like David Bowers direction rarely rises above standard sitcom fare; Vancouver stands in for U.S. locations as it did in the first two films. Obviously theres a formula in place Working with the veteran ""Wimpy Kid"" cast and crew allows for a faster shoot a presumably tighter budget and fewer surprises along the way and as usual the adult cast -- comedians Zahn and Harris in particular -- are reliably game. But kid thesps can only stay young for so long; though Gordon is still appealing his voice has deepened and his features have started to mature. That said Greg Heffleys struggles are universal so at least for now his fans ought not to object.

TWITTER David Bowers film is adapted from the third and fourth books in Jeff Kinneyas wildly successful ""novel in cartoons"" series. Maybe it has to do with the lowered expectations surrounding something with Dog Days in its title being released during a traditionally less-stellar time in the moviegoing season but the third installment in the Wimpy Kid franchise turns out to be not so wimpy after all. Although it paints everything with the same broad sitcom strokes as its predecessor Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days culled from the third and fourth books in Jeff Kinneys wildly successful ""novel in cartoons"" series proves nimbler and truer to its origins than last years Rodrick Rules. Despite the fact that this ""schools out"" edition is hitting theaters at a time when many kids in the country are getting ready to go back the modestly budgeted Fox 2000 presentation still should come within spitball distance of the 53 million taken domestically by its predecessor. Its summer break in the Heffley household and while the teenage Greg (Zachary Gordon) is content to while away the sunny hours inside playing video games his hapless dad Frank (Steve Zahn) has other father-son-bonding ideas. Greg initially is able to dodge working as an intern at Franks office by pretending he already landed a job at the ritzy country club where his buddy Rowley (Robert Capron) belongs -- and where his crush Holly Hills (Peyton List) hangs out -- but when his dad catches on to the ruse Greg gets dragged off on an ill-fated camping trip. David Bowers who also helmed Rodrick Rules and incoming screenwriters Maya Forbes (The Larry Sanders Show) and Wallace Wolodarsky (Monsters vs. Aliens) have brought the title character closer to those wimpier roots after Greg came across as a little too mean-spirited the last time out. As again portrayed by Gordon this time around theres more vulnerability to temper that smartass streak while the story as a whole feels less episodic. You still wont find the characters fleshed out any more substantially than Kinneys stick figures but Zahns unique way with a line reading or reaction keeps things benignly amusing. Also back are Rachael Harris as Gregs just-coping mom and Devon Bostick as lazy big-brother Rodrick. Shooting again took place in Vancouver shot back-to-back with the second film last summer to ensure the wimpy kid didnt look more like a wimpy man.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days Fair Director David Bowers. Cast Zachary Gordon Robert Capron Steve Zahn. Rating PG for some rude humor. Either theyre getting better as they go along or theyre wearing me down. Either way ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days"" the third in the series of movies based on the popular books by Jeff Kinney is the best of the lot. Its not great but the mean-spiritedness that permeated the first film and stuck around a bit for the second is mostly gone. David Bowers who directed the second movie returns for this one as well. There are still problems -- namely that Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon looking like hes about to start shaving) remains just about the dumbest most self-centered kid who ever went to junior high -- but there are some improvements as well. Chief among these is more screen time for Steve Zahn who plays Gregs hapless father Frank. Zahn like Rachael Harris who plays Gregs mom Susan is a gifted comic performer who has gone largely wasted in these movies. Zahn gets to do a lot more this time around; maybe the fourth film if there is one will be Harris time to shine. The movie begins with the end of the school year. Greg has big plans for summer -- to play video games night and day and if things go his way maybe spend whatever time is left with classmate Holly Hills (Peyton List). An attempt to get her phone number goes awry but when his chubby friend Rowley (Robert Capron) invites him for a day at the country club Greg discovers to his delight that Holly is also a member. Things dont work out as smoothly as all that naturally. Greg has many obstacles to overcome -- namely his moronic older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) who is still dumb as a rock but has at least had some of the sadistic edges of the previous two movies sanded off of him. In the second film he actually seemed like a dangerous psychopath. Here hes more your garden-variety lunatic which is a major step forward. Like many comedies -- including great ones such as ""Animal House"" and ""Caddyshack"" -- ""Dog Days"" consists more of a series of unrelated skits than an actual linear story. (Dont be mistaken ""Dog Days"" is not great.) Greg and Rowley go to the boardwalk and get in trouble Greg sneaks Rodrick into the country club (Greg lies to his father and tells him he got a job there) Greg and Rowley play tennis with Holly and the evil Patty Farrell (Laine MacNeil). Some of these scenes are pretty funny -- Rowley and his oddball family in particular are good for a few laughs. And there are some touching moments between Greg and his father though my favorite bonding moment between them is their shared dislike for an old-fashioned cartoon they groan about every morning in the newspaper. (Also They still read newspapers) There are better movies aimed at kids out there and there are worse. Its a good sign for this franchise that ""Dog Days"" is another step in the right direction even if there is still plenty of room for improvement.

Cobbled together from episodes spread across the third and fourth books of Jeff Kinneys popular franchise ""Dog Days"" mostly sees Gregs plans to spend his entire summer zoned out in front of a video game sabotaged by Dad (Steve Zahn) and his forced efforts to properly bond with the middle child of the Heffley clan. The threat of a stern prep school in his future prompts Greg to do what Greg does best (or at least most often) he lies. Specifically he lies about taking some responsibility and getting a job at the local country club where hes actually shown up as the guest of best friend Rowley (Robert Capron) to stalk his crush Holly (Peyton List). Privilege abuse pool-based embarrassment and tennis court silliness ensue not to mention the involvement of Gregs pushy older brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) and his infatuation with Hollys own prissy sister. But wait Theres more In keeping with the slapdash directorial tradition of the previous films (David Bowers also helmed last years ""Rodrick Rules"") we jump back and forth between so many other half-hearted threads that it can feel a bit like surfing between channels that strictly show episodes of a never-made ""Wimpy Kid"" TV show. Dad gets the family a dog Rowleys family invites Greg on a vacation and proves to be surprisingly sensitive Mom starts a book club Dad competes with the fellow leader of an ill-planned scouting trip Of course many of these dilemmas would be remedied if Greg didnt have such a propensity for outright fibbery but if he didnt we wouldnt really have a movie. In turn its a character trait that has consistently made our hapless lead difficult to care for. Hes not wimpy so much as callous and careless in his actions setting off technological mishaps usually reserved for female characters on ""The Newsroom"" and asking a man whos HOLDING CLEAN TOWELS to pass him some especially girly swim trunks after he loses his own at the country club pool. The fact that Gordon has managed to make Greg even remotely sympathetic is to the young actors credit. More admirably exuberant are Bostick and Zahn. The former belts out punk-rock Beiber covers with no shortage of aplomb while the latter -- dearly missed in the world of movies not named ""Wimpy Kid"" -- both matches the manic energy of the series with his frequent mugging and sells solemn lines to the effect of ""How could you rack up 260 in smoothies?"" like a champ. While one wonders if Gregs lying streak will eventually see him the subject of a ""Shattered Glass""-like drama once the series reaches his college years I have it on good authority that Steve Zahn is already pretty good at handling those kinds of things. To read the country club antics between Greg and Rowley as something of a parallel for modern concerns over class struggles might be overthinking things a bit but in a summer where even the dance movie sequel arguably had our economic divide in mind it will at least give the parents something to do with their time. A bit harder to argue against is this entrys addition of homophobic humor in its gag-inducing arsenal. Greg treats an early scene set in a locker room and public shower like hes crossing a minefield; later he cant stand the thought of sharing a bed with his lifelong pal. Meanwhile Rodrick freaks out as a grown man proceeds to give him needless poolside CPR. Its a crutch on which the other films hardly if ever relied more than happy to instead dole out the goofy gooey nonsense that pleases the sub-teen set. All of that is here as well but at this point they stick out specifically as the kind of jokes that the summers family films (""Brave"" ""Madagascar 3 Europes Most Wanted"") have generally mercifully avoided so far. Alas the grosses suggest that the gross-out factor has its place and parents already indoctrinated by the likes of the ""Wimpy Kid"" franchise shouldnt find themselves surprised by much of what ""Dog Days"" has to offer.

Director David Bowers (134). PG Silly kid gross-out humor. Area theaters. Like a kid in a mid-day algebra class ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Dog Days"" only wakes up for the louder crasser jokes its pals crack. The third in the film series based on Jeff Kinneys wry books about middle-school everykid Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) ""Dog Days"" wants to have fun but doesnt know that the best fun happens when you dont plan it. Of course summertime for a kid going into eighth grade is supposed to be nothing but fun. Yet Gregs old-fashioned dad (Steve Zahn) is planning a video game-free three months for his kids; Gregs big brother Rodrick (Devon Bostick) is horning in on Greg and Rowleys (Robert Capron) time at an exclusive pool; and Gregs hopes to hang with Holly (Peyton List) the cute girl from his class get sidetracked by her sisters Sweet 16 party. The shenanigans the kids get into are as in the first two films refreshingly banal though there is undeniably a bigger ""yuck"" factor that spoils a lot of scenes. Theres also more than a few unnecessary distractions like dads Civil War reenactors club that feel like time-fillers. And unlike last years superior ""Judy Moody and the Not Bummer Summer"" -- which put its grade-school heroine through similarly seasonal woes -- ""Dog Days"" squanders several chances to find something magical in the mundane. The cast though remains pleasantly game. Gordon is an appealingly flummoxed could-be-cool-kid stuck like gum to pre-adolescence; Bostick scowls wittily as the wanna-be-rocker Rodrick and Zahn and Rachael Harris are quirkly confused as Gen-X parents unsure how their boys became uncouth layabouts. Given short shrift though are Gregs goofy pals including Grayson Russell as oddball Fregley and Karan Brar as melodramatic Chirag. Most unused though is Capron whose Curly Howard-ish face and Oliver Hardy mannerisms again earn him straight As in the kid-comic division. In terms of wacky these guys are far from wimpy. Magic Moment A battle for the TV results in a fatherly moment of (cable) disconnection.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In an era of 3-D childrens films with fantastical premises and CGI spectacle and supernatural protagonists theres something ingratiatingly modest about the life-sized two-dimensional world of the wildly popular Diary Of A Wimpy Kid books and movies. While the defiantly non-epic trilogy exaggerates the gauntlet of humiliation that faces kids in those awkward in-between years to brightly comic effect the emotions on display are all refreshingly relatable if a tad generic. So too the films aggressively unremarkable protagonist (Zachary Gordon) a likable Everykid whose aspirations for his summer break begin and end with playing as many video games as possible preferably in the company of the cute classmate he has a crush on. Fate and his outdoors-minded father (Steve Zahn adding texture and dimension to what could easily have come off as a thankless role) have other plans for Gordon however and his summer proceeds in ways he never anticipated. In Diary Of A Wimpy Kid Dog Days Gordons plans to spend his break luxuriating in air-conditioned comfort while staring blankly at various screens die a quick death when his dad bans television and video games for the summer. Even more horrifyingly Gordons mother wants him to--gasp--spend the summer reading books so the terrified youngster decides to pretend to have a job at a nearby country club as a pretext for hanging out with his chubby endlessly ebullient best buddy (Robert Capron) and getting closer to the girl of his dreams. Like the books that inspired it Diary Of A Wimpy Kid Dog Days is an episodic relatively disjointed ramble through a neverending string of minor embarrassments involving unintentional skinny-dipping Civil War reenactments gone awry and most entertainingly a typically ill-fated trip with Caprons clan a disturbingly clean-cut bunch so wholesome and suspiciously positive they come off as a one-family cult. Genial and pleasant to a fault the film could benefit from a little more personality. Its funniest and most memorable sequence a hilarious set piece where Gordons older brother (pouty-lipped Devon Bostwick who looks unnervingly like a young version of John Lazar the actor who played ""Z-Man"" in Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls) favors a Sweet Sixteen party with a swaggeringly misguided Mick Jagger-gone-tone-deaf version of a Justin Bieber song is also the only scene that takes any chances. Diary Of A Wimpy Kid benefits from not trying too hard but it wouldnt hurt if it had tried just a little bit harder anyway.

"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Third movie does no favors to Wimpy Kid material  1/2August 02 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticWhy are the ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" movies so much less fun and funny than the best of the books created by Jeff Kinney?On the page Kinneys illustrations those stick-figure humiliations and angsty margin doodles allegedly drawn by the exasperated protagonist Greg Heffley hold the key to why ""Wimpy Kid"" took off with so many millions of young and angsty seekers of humiliation comedy. Perpetual grinding setbacks and massive why-me? preteen injustices are more amusing in stick-figure form.Somehow all that snark all those red-faced setbacks turn to indistinct and slightly sour mush in a live-action setting. Kids are going to go to the films regardless. But its too bad these movies arent livelier.The first two films (modestly budgeted and rightly so) did well so here we have""Diary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days""a conflation of books three and four. The narrative requires fretful dissembling Greg to lie throughout about big things and little things and then to pay the price before learning a lesson or two about being a less fretful dissembling version of himself. I found the results about as cheering as ""The Dark Knight Rises"" mainly because the craft is so slovenly and routine.Greg is played once again by the talented Zachary Gordon now with newly changed voice. Its summer vacation and Greg wants only to spend his days video gaming. But dad (Steve Zahn) has plans to school Greg in the wonders of Wilderness Explorers camping; his mom (Rachael Harris) starts up a ""Little Women"" book club; and Gregs pal Rowley (Robert Capron straight from playing young Curly in the recent ""Three Stooges"" movie) sneaks Greg into his country club so Greg can be around Holly (Peyton List) the nice girl who teaches tennis and whose older sister is such a bully you keep waiting for the moment when smiling patient Holly snaps and the police are called.As directed by David Bowers (who did the second film) the movie never finds the heightened state of comic anxiety that fuels the books. The actors many of them excellent pop their eyes and prolong their reactions and their timing goes flooey. Here and there in the father/son scenes you see a glimmer of an honest interaction. All in all Id rather watch a ""Neds Declassified School Survival Guide"" rerun.mjphillipstribune.comDiary of a Wimpy Kid Dog Days -- 1 1/2 starsMPAA rating PG (for some rude humor)Running time 134Opens Friday MORE`I Believe We Killed Jordans DadPain relievers What are the differences?Gutierrezs Tax Bill Proves That Miracles Still Do Happen Princess Grace`s Fatal Crash Her Daughter`s AccountLife Skill 201 Washing a baseball cap10 reasons why you want the job Related LinksRelated ArticlesBattling bros perk up the Kid plotMarch 24 2011Live action erases charm from Diary of a Wimpy KidMarch 18 2010Boys line up for chance to be new Wimpy KidNovember 11 2008Interview with a Wimpy Kid fanJanuary 13 2009Disneys Jessie star to appear at Last FlingAugust 6 2013Find More Stories AboutDiaryDog DaysWimpy KidGreg HeffleyTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyIndex by DateIndex by Keywordwww.chicagotribune.comConnectLike us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0801-diary-wimpy-kid-dog-days-20120802,0,781508.column",200,diaryofawimpykiddogdays19,diaryofawimpykiddogdays,chicagotribune

This third film centres on Gregs (Zachary Gordon) desire to spend the summer lazing by a pool with his pal (Robert Capron) his strained relationship with his jovial but awkward father (Steve Zahn) and his hankering after a blonde airhead (Peyton List). Once again Gregs older bullying brother (Devon Bostick) provides the only real laughs. Kinneys graphic novellas are humorously illustrated and perceptive so its a shame that Hollywood felt the need to pander to baser instincts by turning them into a series of live action films that bear little relationship to the world on the page.
