She was the weirdo flatmate in Bridesmaids and is a writerss dream she makes funny funnier. And this college comedy is already pretty funny. It follows the naffest tribe on campus acappella singers. An all-girl group The Bellas are recruiting. What they want are super-hot girls with bikini-ready bodies and perfect pitch. What they get is Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and alt-girl Beca (Anna Kendrick) - who tries to take the group from Mariah Carey-lame to hip hop-cool.Pitch Perfect isnt quite up there with Bridesmaids. In places it feels like a textbook comedy - a running gross-out joke about projectile vomiting is lazy. But 30 Rock and New Girl writer Kay Cannon has created brilliant characters. Best of all is Fat Amy; in any other film shed be picked on or made fun of. Here shes the coolest woman in the room. You call yourself ""Fat Amy""? someone asks her. Yeah so twig bitches like you dont do it behind my back. Genius.

It makes me feel like a tween watching grease for the first time. The film is brilliantly funny with music that will make you smile (so much so I have the soundtrack as part of my commute playlist) and has some superb characters. I recommend turning up the volume to hear what Lilly has to say enjoy. Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 27 2013PJFeaturedBest movie ever. Fat Amy is the best and always will be no one can beat her.

With the ""all girls together"" acappella plotline with its win against the odds story the outsider girl falling in love and realising that friends are important it has a plot even a blind person could follow without the aid of a guide dog why did I like it? There is just enough humour to tip the scales in its favour from the wonderful pair of commentators to the interplay between the girls. Dont go expecting a film to change your life accept it as an enjoyable piece of diversion where the music is kept just below the level where enjoyable becomes an endurance. The plot is worth 2 stars but the acting and humour bring it up to a solid 3 stars.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/94967/pitch-perfect.html,200,pitchperfect0,pitchperfect,timeout

Literally. Like all over the audience. Flash forward several months to a new school year when most of the Bellas have either graduated or quit the group in vomit-induced shame and Aubrey and the only other remaining Bella Chloe (an adorable Brittany Snow) are tasked with building a new team from scratch. Enter the weirdos led by a hilarious Rebel Wilson (self-named Fat Amy) and a brooding Anna Kendrick as Beca a sarcastic spitfire who just wants to apply more eyeliner and hop a bus to L.A. to become a DJ. A host of interesting characters round out the group some more fully realized than others--youve got a black lesbian (thats it. Thats her personality) a quiet Asian girl (who granted might be a serial killer) a slutty slut and some girls who you literally forget are there (until the movie points out that you literally forgot they were there). Its these clever winks at the usual tropes that Pitch Perfect does best acknowledging its genre--Revenge of Nerds the Musical Starring Ladies--and then often blasting away expectations usually in the form of a ridiculously fun mash-up. The movie works because even though theres an awkward and unnecessary romantic subplot some lazy stereotypes (shes a black lesbian We get it we get it) and not enough singing (never enough singing) the girls for the most part are genuinely funny weird real and most excitingly confident.

This a cappella college musical comedy based on a nonfiction book by Mickey Rapkin turns out to be the years most exhilarating pick-me-up. The screenwriter Kay Cannon is an improv comedienne who also writes for 30 Rock and my guess is shes so used to trying to top her colleagues that left alone she has to keep topping herself with all that madcap invention carrying over into the singing and dancing. She has the perfect nervy nerdy needy alter ego in Anna Kendrick. Twenty-six when she made Pitch Perfect Kendrick at first looks too put-together for Beca a college freshman who wants to be producing records instead of wasting time in school. But acting overly self-sufficient is part of Becas problem too and Kendricks mask of incredulity (as if to say ""What am I doing in a dingbat a cappella musical?"") makes Becas surrender to the music that much finer. Beca is used to working alone making mixes on her computer. She doesnt want to put on a short sky-blue dress and heels and warble ""The Sign"" behind Aubrey (Anna Camp) an authoritarian blonde whos so neurotically overcontrolled (""Aca-scuse me?"" she will query dissenters) that she compensates by projectile vomiting. Ordinarily Beca wouldnt be a candidate for ""the Bellas"" but the group had a bad previous year thanks to Aubreys shaky stomach and Aubrey and her sidekick Chloe (Brittany Snow) have to lower their standards from ""super-hot girls with bikini-ready bods"" to anyone with two X chromosomes. Among the recruits is Aussie Rebel Wilson as ""Fat Amy"" -- what the character calls herself so that she matter-of-factly explains to Aubrey and Chloe ""you dont do it behind my back."" A great joke a layer of funny over a world of hurt. Director Jason Moore is a Broadway hand (Avenue Q) who knows how to sell a number without assaulting the audience and right from the jump he and a cappela ""godfathers"" Ed Boyer and Deke Sharon and choreographer Aakoman ""AJ"" Jones nail the tone silly-exquisite too hyperbolic to be straight too emotionally pure and well pitch-perfect to be camp. Lisa Zeno Churgins editing is brilliantly off the beat Julio Macats camera at just the right distance for us to savor all those different bodies -- petite fat willowy beefy -- in motion. I wasnt looking forward to remakes and mashups of songs that make me long for deafness when my daughters blast Z100 in the car but I was humming along with ""Titanium"" and ""Dont Stop the Music"" and even ""Party in the U.S.A."" (The soundtrack is a joy.) The cast includes a full-time songwriter Ester Dean who wrote Rihannas ""Samp;M"" (which she sings a piece of) and the only thing wrong with movies centerpiece -- a ""riff off"" in which rival a cappella groups bring it on (and then get loaded and fall into bed) -- is that it ends too soon. Pitch Perfect is the sort of overstuffed pinata in which even the bad guy sparkles As Bumper leader of the all-male Treblemakers Adam DeVine is an overgrown baby swaddled in self-love. There are so few clunkers in Pitch Perfect -- even the attempt of Becas Treblemakers suitor (Skylar Astin) to make her love movies by watching the end of The Breakfast Club has an emotional payoff. The device of ill-matched TV commentators is obviously swiped from Christopher Guests Best in Show but I loved every boorish misogynist interjection of John Michael Higgins and acid rejoinder of Elizabeth Banks (who co-produced the movie). Cannon doesnt go in for rococo hipster badinage in the vein of Diablo Cody. She can pare down a joke to its essence as in all the shots of Lilly (Hanna Mae Lee) a Bella with a teeny-tiny mouth out of which comes sounds so faint even Horton couldnt hear them or the frat boy who listens to the Bellas first public performance and says puzzled ""This makes my beer taste bad."" Pitch Perfect made my soda taste aca-mazing.

Eh. In ""Pitch Perfect"" Anna Kendrick plays a music-mad college freshman who loves to take a beat from one song layer a vocal track from another on top of it and segue into yet another tune halfway through. Done right its a way to create something new out of old parts. Done wrong its just a jumble of old parts. And unfortunately her movie does not do it right. Like one of its heroines mixes ""Pitch Perfect"" borrows from a lot of sources. Yes theres a whole lot of ""Glee"" here. Plus the girl-power competitions of ""Bring It On."" Plus some gross-out ""Bridesmaids"" humor and even weirdly a little touch of ""Best in Show."" But it never harmonizes. The basic plot has Kendrick -- an edgy ""alterna-girl"" as someone pegs her -- arriving at a college at which a cappella groups are popular. She decides for uncertain reasons to join the most hidebound where all the girls dress alike and a Type A queen bee rules. Are you surprised that she and the club president will clash? Can you predict that before the film ends lessons will be learned friendships forged and hugs exchanged? Still there are bits in the film that work like disparate solos in some overlong song. The best scenes -- although they feel like theyre from a different movie possibly one of Christopher Guests -- have John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks as sniping play-by-play commentators announcing the (supposedly televised) competitions. And the hardest working woman in show business continues to be Rebel Wilson the plus-size Down Under comedian who broke out in ""Bridesmaids"" delighted in ""Bachelorette"" and was one of the few bright spots in ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting."" She plays Fat Amy here -- who calls herself that to beat her skinny frenemies to the punch -- and almost works too hard. You can see her mugging even when shes in the background. Still someone needs to give this film some life. Because its not coming from its lead. Kendrick has been a small breath of fun in the ""Twilight"" movies and was very good in ""Up in the Air"" but those were supporting roles. Here she has the lead and a poorly written one; she just seems snide and snippy from the start. ""You push everybody away"" a boyfriend tells her. Yes she does and that includes the audience. Some out-of-left-field jokes work well. A creepy club member only speaks in whispers and confides secrets such as ""I ate my twin in the womb""; that is definitely damaged and -- like the Higgins and Banks bits -- hints at an entirely different movie. But instead what we have here is a not-very-funny college comedy for tweens full of unappealing characters (and although the musical arrangements are fun some truly unimaginative choreography). Its all a bit of a letdown. You settle in wanting to enjoy the whole experience. But 20 minutes in youre wishing you could hit Shuffle. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual references and underage drinking. Pitch Perfect (PG-13) Universal (112 min.) Directed by Jason Moore. With Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson.

(Peter Iovino photo)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 28 2012Pitch Perfect (out of 4)Starring Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson Brittany Snow Anna Camp and Skylar Astin. Directed by Jason Moore. At GTA theatres. 112 minutes.Pitch Perfect is Bring It On without the pom-poms and Drumline without the percussion but it does have projectile vomiting.All of which is both as good and as bad as that description sounds. Luckily the good outweighs the bad in this bright n breezy comedy about competitive a cappella singing groups.Article Continued BelowLike Bring It On (cheerleading) and Drumline (marching bands) Pitch Perfect situates itself between collegiate rivals aspiring to ace a life-changing competition here the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA).It was at the ICCA where designated underdogs The Bellas representing Barden University gasped to a halt after their tightly wound leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) violently hurled during a performance of Ace of Bases ""The Sign.""Painfully stating the obvious the event announcers (John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks goofing like Best In Show) point out The Bellas are no match for the fellas of Treble Makers perennial winners led by the perfectly obnoxious Bumper (Adam DeVine).Time for retooling which coincides with the college arrival of freshman Beca a role that allows Anna Kendrick to shake up her straight-arrow image. Shes not entirely convincing playing the ""alt-girl"" even with tattoos black nails and a perpetual scowl but shes close enough -- and ""close enough"" is a handy description for this picture too.Kendrick can really sing too and if shes not as good as the others in the Bellas well she is the one with most star power.An aspiring DJ with a Mac full of hip beats Beca sneers at the Bellas and their ""not of this century"" playlist which also includes the disco earworm ""Turn the Beat Around."" A challenge from her father and a shower-singing surprise change Becas mind. Soon shes attempting to groove with the likes of bossy Aubrey perky Chloe (Brittany Snow) and the defensively named Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson licensed to steal).Whats a woman to do when she aspires to throw down but has to deal with the throw-up Aubreys cheesy tunes?You dont need perfect pitch to figure out where this musical mash-up is headed which fresh-to-film director Jason Moore (Broadways Avenue Q) guides to a resolution that is both predictable and tuneful.The movie succeeds in spite of painful stereotypes a tepid romance (Skylar Astin is the designated distraction) and a few logic gaps (howd the Bellas get so good so fast? Why is The Breakfast Club a millennial touchstone?)Theres yet another movie comparison to be made here. Its Bridesmaids which brings us back to those explosive bodily fluids and also to Rebel Wilson who had a small role in that earlier hit and whom Pitch Perfect screenwriter Kay Cannon (TVs 30 Rock) models on Melissa McCarthys bumptious Megan.Shes not as funny as McCarthy but as with everything else in Pitch Perfect shes close enough.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Pitch Perfect (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Pitch Perfect (PG-13) Of course the bad girls really good Rebel Wilson in Pitch Perfect. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle | coglemiamiherald.com9/27/2012 Editor rating 3 Remember when Glee was actually entertaining back before all the preaching and embarrassing original songs and cast members recruited via reality TV? If you miss those halcyon days then Pitch Perfect should fill the void nicely. Even if youre not a particular fan of singing competitions this energetic comedy about warring college a cappella groups based on a nonfiction book of the same title is impossible not to like. The film stars Anna Kendrick (50/50 Up in the Air) as Beca a freshman tagged in collegespeak as ""alternative"" due to a variety of tattoos and spiky earrings. Beca is rebelling against her professor fathers desire that she earn a (free) college degree at Barden University where he teaches. She sees school as a waste of time. She wants to be a DJ and remix just about every song she hears -- Im particularly fond of her version of The Proclaimers Im Gonna Be (500 Miles). To be fair shes got the ear and imagination for the profession. But Dad says no until she at least gives college life a try. Reluctantly seeking an activity to prove shes attempting to fit in Beca ends up auditioning for the prissy Bellas one of the schools a cappella groups with an unfortunate past involving public projectile vomiting. Her tryout is inspiring but she doesnt exactly mesh with the girly leaders (Brittany Snow and Anna Camp). Still she can sing and the Bellas are desperate to beat their mortal enemies the cocky Treblemakers a boys group that takes winning as its prerogative. The Treblemakers have a knack for choosing the perfect popular songs to perform in competition; they even have one guy who can rap which gives them an edge and enables them to pull off fresh daring mixes involving Flo Ridas version of Right Round. The Bellas on the other hand dress like flight attendants circa 1970 and think singing Turn the Beat Around is the height of daring. You know by the end that Beca will persuade the Bellas to adapt their songlist to suit her talents but even so getting to that point is a lot of fun due largely to Rebel Wilson (Bachelorette) as Fat Amy (her name for herself employed as a method of beating skinny mean girls to the punch). Wilson gets all the good lines and makes the most of them and frequent sidekick Kendrick -- a Twilight veteran nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as George Clooneys uptight young colleague in Up in the Air -- steps into the leading lady role with good humor and grace. But the real highlights of the film are the upbeat musical numbers well choreographed and remixed just the way Beca would like them. If youre not grinning by the end of this light funny crowd-pleaser consider yourself tone deaf.

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures Peter Iovino) Peter Iovino This image released by Universal Pictures shows Rebel Wilson portraying Fat Amy in a scene from her film ""Pitch Perfect."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Peter Iovino) The a cappella singing craze has been as unexpected as the Spanish Inquisition and considerably less painful.The notion that gleeful groups of students are singing sans instrumentation sounds like a fantasy hatched by the Handlebar Mustache Association circa 1898. But these arent your grandfathers barbershop buddies and the trendy musical menu comes fortified with irony.The campus comedy ""Pitch Perfect"" harmonizes high-end performance with low-brow spoofery. Its like a National Lampoon parody where the targets write the jokes. Cynical Beca (Anna Kendrick) reluctantly enrolls at Barden University because her father is a teacher there but shed rather be in L.A. mixing hip-hop records. At the activities fair she sneers at all the cliques but her dad insists that she join a club to get acclimated so after shes overheard singing in the shower she agrees to join the Bellas singing group.The Bellas made it to the national finals in New York last year (emceed by John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks like an outtake from ""Best in Show"") but queen bee Aubrey (Anna Camp) had an attack of stage fright that went viral so this year she is cracking the whip. Yet beside lieutenant Chloe (Brittany Snow) the group includes some oddballs including a whisperer a jailhouse lesbian and an obese Australian who preemptively calls herself Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). And the boys in the rival group the Treblemakers are continually trying to seduce and thus disqualify the best Bellas.Yet Beca flirts with a Treblemaker named Jesse (Skylar Austin) and adds mashup-style spontaneity to the Bellas carefully choreographed routines. Naturally the internal clash of wills and the external romance reach a crescendo at this years finals but were not supposed to take any of this seriously. The singing and dancing are solidly silly. (One group of competitors called Sockapella performs with hosiery on their hands.)Belatedly riffing on the TV series ""Glee"" might have produced some sour notes but ""Pitch Perfect"" finds just the right tone.

Starring Anna Kendrick Brittany Snow Christopher Mintz-Plasse Rebel Wilson Anna Camp Alexis Knapp Adam DeVine Freddie Stroma Skylar Astin Jacob Wysocki Director Jason Moore Running time 152 Release Opened Sep 28 2012  Editorial Review Hits almost all the right notesBy Michael OSullivanFriday September 28 2012The last thing I expected to see in the credits for ""Pitch Perfect"" -- a comedy about the world of competitive collegiate a cappella that is as funny as it is infectiously toe-tapping -- was the phrase ""based on a book."" Unless that book had come out with a companion music CD its hard to imagine it conveying the movies giddy sense of exuberance and yes silliness generated by teams of young adults vying against each other in cutthroat singing contests where the only weapon is the unaccompanied human voice. (Well that and the occasional sock puppet. The film which exhausts every conceivable pun on the term ""a cappella"" features a group of singing puppeteers called Sockapella.) Author Mickey Rapkins 2008 nonfiction book which went behind the scenes at the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella was the inspiration for screenwriter Kay Cannon a writer and producer for ""30 Rock."" Directed with brio by Broadway veteran Jason Moore (""Shrek the Musical"") Cannons script combines the obvious elements of ""Glee"" with the plot and snark of the 2000 competitive-cheerleading comedy ""Bring It On."" Running through it all is the surreal DNA of ""30 Rock"" coupled with that shows satirical plausibility. For the most part it works brilliantly. Thats largely due to the music which the movie approaches with an attitude halfway between awe and skepticism. To its credit ""Pitch Perfect"" totally gets one critical fact A cappella singing contests are both a little bit amazing and a little bit ridiculous. The tone that the film strikes is a perfect balance between the two extremes. Anna Kendrick also helps. In the lead role of Beca -- an alterna-chick who dreams of producing music in Los Angeles and who only reluctantly joins her schools all-female singing group the Bellas -- Kendrick brings a healthy amount of amused detachment. Nominated for a Tony at the age of 12 for her performance in the musical ""High Society"" she has a great set of pipes on top of a fine sense of comedy. Its also a real pleasure to see Rebel Wilson in the first role to truly showcase her talents since ""Bridesmaids."" As Becas fellow Bella Fat Amy -- a character who co-opts her insulting nickname so that others wont do it behind her back -- Wilson shines. Shes large and in charge as she should be. Skylar Astin is equally adorable as Becas soulful-eyed and golden-throated love interest Jesse. And Adam Devine of ""Workaholics"" is deliciously mean as Bumper the leader of the Bellas arch-rivals the Treblemakers for whom Jesse also sings. Not that ""Pitch Perfect"" is perfect by any means. The humor is sometimes needlessly crass racially insensitive and disgusting. A couple of projectile-vomiting scenes set a new standard for the lowbrow gag which is fast becoming a hallmark of 21st-century comedy. The story itself is also overly familiar and it drags at times especially when the singing stops. But my oh my when the movie just shuts up and lets us listen to these kids belt away as it does in a very funny -- and unexpectedly thrilling -- outdoor ""riff-off"" its goofy charms like those of the music are almost impossible to resist.Contains sexual humor crude language and drug references.

""I love you awesome nerds"" says one girl to her fellow a cappella singers at the end of the college singing-group comedy ""Pitch Perfect"" and who could disagree? Bouncy vocal rearrangements of pop songs sparkling choreography and a hilarious script make for a movie thats made to be obsessed over seen 50 times quoted as devoutly as such sacred texts as ""Heathers"" and ""Bring It On."" The movie stars Anna Kendrick as the cool girl who gets roped into the campus nerd herd and here the thesauri fail It turns out there is no existing word adequate for her awesomeness. Mega-cute in ""Up in the Air"" and ""50/50"" Kendrick here is snarky and tough without ever coming across as bitchy or entitled -- a ballsier update of 1990 Winona Ryder. Recruited by the groups leaders (Anna Camp and Brittany Snow) who tell her they travel the world to perform in championships Kendricks Beca asks ""On purpose?"" But the opportunity to do ""No Diggity"" in an empty swimming pool awaits so Beca joins forces with girls like Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson also brilliant) who gave herself that name ""so twig bitches like you dont do it behind my back"" and a near-mute girl (Hana Mae Lee) who speaks in strange whispers Listen carefully and youll (barely) hear her say things like ""You guys wanna see a dead body?"" or ""I ate my twin in the womb."" Meanwhile the rival boy group the Treble Makers takes on vital heckling duties. Their members include a guy crushing on Beca at their dull internship (hes played by Skylar Astin who is likable but a bit dull in the way of a WB Network star) and a chubby-faced would-be teen idol called Bumper (Adam DeVine who also gets big laughs). Scene after scene detonates like a little joy bomb the way ""Hairspray"" did There are auditions and riff-offs (one group tries to out-improv the other) and bus trips (one of the best scenes features the girls on the road while randomly busting out ""Party in the USA""). There is also slightly too much vomit. The girls say things like ""My fellow a-ca people"" and ""a ca scuse me?"" Someone who is asked if she is being serious says ""Dixie Chicks serious"" In the background during the singing competitions a pair of announcers (John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks) delivers rude commentary on it all ""This number is like an elephant dart to the publics face."" The first produced screenplay by ""30 Rock"" writer Kay Cannon who adapted a book by Mickey Rapkin contains as many quotable lines as ""Austin Powers"" and director Jason Moore (also a rookie though he directed the Broadway sensation ""Avenue Q"") keeps a pace so fast you barely have time to wind up the last laugh before another great line comes along. Its already hard to picture a world when people didnt go around saying ""Could you please get your head out of your ass? Its not a hat"" or ""Im gonna finish him like a cheesecake."" Ill overlook the cheating in the big finale (the girl group is obviously getting help from invisible male singers on the soundtrack to round out the bass lines) and the so-so love scenes. This movies so good its a cappella version of Bruno Mars ""Just the Way You Are"" is actually better than the original. But then again bacterial meningitis is better than the original.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT At a small college boys and girls face off for the national a cappella championships; reated PG-13 (mild language crude humor). BOTTOM LINE An energetic cast livens up this overlong episode of ""Glee"" but the weak singing and wobbly script make for many an off note. CAST Anna Kendrick Anna Camp Skylar Astin Rebel Wilson Elizabeth Banks John Michael Higgins LENGTH 152 It isnt easy to find a youth culture that the movies havent already exploited to death. Were already familiar with break-dancing cheerleading and even debating teams. But what about competitive a cappella? That has potential especially now that Foxs ""Glee"" has made the theater kids cool. ""Pitch Perfect"" seems keenly aware of pop-cultural currents -- its directed by Jason Moore (Broadways ""Avenue Q"") and written by Kay Cannon (NBCs ""30 Rock"") from a novel by Mickey Rapkin (a former GQ editor) -- but that ultimately undermines it. Though likable and energetic the movie is so eager to put a finger on every pulse that it loses the rhythm. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Anna Kendrick plays Beca a budding DJ reluctantly attending Barden University. Strolling the quad shes recruited by Aubrey (Anna Camp) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) leaders of The Bellas a team of a desperate a cappella losers. Across campus cute freshman Jesse (Skylar Astin) joins the all-male Treblemakers setting the stage for a Romeo-Juliet romance. The cast is appealing Rebel Wilson of ""Bridesmaids"" has fun as the overconfident Fat Amy while Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins get the most laughs as a pair of sardonic commentators. But like a teenager trying out identities ""Pitch Perfect"" cant decide on one. Are the Bellas the ""Animal House"" of Barden U. or the ""Mean Girls""? Is Beca the creative thinker bucking tradition or the misfit learning to fit in? Are the Treblemakers really vicious misogynists (Adam DeVine plays their trash-talking leader Bumper) or just shy nerds? Another glaring problem Nobody seems to have much of a voice. Kendrick sounds fine singing David Guettas ""Titanium"" in the dorm shower but her rap version of Blackstreets ""No Diggity"" is uh not a showstopper. The whole movie as Randy Jackson might say is pitchy. 250 VideoTrailer Pitch Perfect PLOT At a small college boys and girls face off for the national a cappella championships. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (mild language crude humor) CAST Anna Kendrick Anna Camp Skylar Astin Rebel Wilson LENGTH 152 BOTTOM LINE An energetic cast livens up this overlong episode of ""Glee"" but the weak singing and wobbly script make for many an off note.

Geoff Pevere Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 28 2012 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Sep. 27 2012 358PM EDT Comments AA Directed by Jason Moore Written by Kay Cannon Starring Anna Kendrick Anna Camp Skylar Austin Classification PG Genre comedy Year 2012 Country USA Language English The biggest challenge facing Beca (Anna Kendrick) is that shes the most rebellious member of her all-girl competitive college a cappella group.The biggest challenge facing viewers 35 and over of Pitch Perfect the smartly executed new musical comedy is accepting that a movie about competitive college a cappella singing could even exist - let alone be good. film Pitch Perfect Official trailer But if thats your way of thinking you havent been paying attention.While you were listening to rock or hip hop or watching HBO or AMC many of your kids were grooving to Glee American Idol or Dancing With the Stars marking a dramatic shift in intergenerational cultural tastes.Old-school showbiz shtick has made a huge comeback. Its suddenly cool to do the kind of thing that once drove kids into the electric arms of amplified feedback Get up on stage and make like Mickey Rooney.In this sense Pitch Perfect is pure processed 21st-century schmaltz a lets-put-on-a-show story so steeped in backlot Hollywood convention it almost embarrasses itself with the difference being it really doesnt care.If youve got a problem with what the kids on campus are doing for fun youre probably as lamely out of touch as Becas fortysomething single professor dad who just wishes she would give up her fantasy of a musical career and make the most of her free college tuition. (That Beca really wants to be a deejay is a major issue If the girl toted a guitar instead of a turntable around Im guessing Poppa wouldnt preach so much.)So here you are Its the first day of school at Barden U and the reluctant alt-minded Beca is asked to join the ailing Barden Bellas one of the institutions many competitive a capella groups but also the one with the most debilitating handicaps.First of all its all-girl - and apart from being a form of music that hasnt thrived since the Moonglows were still charting a cappella is apparently also a largely male domain. (Yes folks yet another instance of seismic cultural redistribution a cappella is macho.)Secondly the Barden Bellas are non-negotiably presided over by Aubrey (Anna Camp) a bitchy blond traditionalist who not only insists the Bellas dress like air hostesses on stage and do endlessly listless reprises of Turn the Beat Around she has the poor public relations habit of projectile vomiting over the first three rows when nerves get the better of her.From the beginning its clear what the Bellas need in order to unseat the arrogant Bardem boy-band trophy holders the Treble Makers Beca and her pierced-ear mix-tape sensibility (did I mention that she can sing like hell?). Its also clear that this wont happen until the end after weve been suitably set up to get maximum emotional release from the big night everythings-at-stake whole-world-is-watching show-stopper.In the meantime Beca must be courted by a boy (Skylar Astin a Breakfast Club-loving conspicuously sensitive Treble Maker) reject him woo him back and prove to the autocratic Aubrey that its okay to ditch the stewardess drag and let it rip with a nasty mashup once in a while.Pitch Perfect pitches itself between Bridesmaids and Glee which is to say it celebrates the low-down raunchiness of girls being girls among girls while delivering a snap-crackle-and-pop music catharsis.

Sponsored LinksThe spirited a cappella singing in Pitch Perfect makes a predictable feather-light coming-of-age film irresistibly fun.Inspired by the increasingly popular phenomenon of college a cappella groups and based on the 2009 non-fiction book Pitch Perfect The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory by Mickey Rapkin Pitch Perfect (   out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday in select cities) showcases this campus subculture in all its eccentricities while capturing the cutthroat rivalry among its singing members.TRAILER Pitch PerfectPitch Perfect will fill the bill nicely for those who yearn for the glory days of Glee enjoy fast-paced nerdy snarkiness and have a soft spot for tales of rhythmic scholastic activities as in Drumline or Stomp the Yard.Beca (Anna Kendrick) goes to college against her will prodded by her professor father. What she really wants to do is produce music. Her first move is to get a job at the campus radio station where she meets fellow music aficionado and warbler Jesse (Skylar Astin). A flirty friendship is born.Beca is roped into joining The Bellas an all-girl a cappella group by the gung-ho Chloe (Brittany Snow) who hears her singing in their dorm shower. Soon Beca becomes a key member of this group of lovable motley musical misfits. The best of the bunch is Amy (Rebel Wilson) who calls herself ""Fat Amy"" since she figures others will behind her back. Her dance moves are hilarious and her singing is powerful. Then theres Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) an Asian girl so seemingly demure that she speaks in scarcely audible whispers. (But what shes actually saying is comically offbeat.)Cast as an alt-girl Beca attempts to take The Bellas in edgier directions moving away from their traditional harmonies and staid arrangements to incorporate new mash-ups. She and Aubrey (Anna Camp) the uptight leader of the group inevitably lock horns.The Bellas take on the all-male Treblemakers (which Jesse joins) in the national competition and in between the pop confections we get the funny quips of commentators John (John Michael Higgins) and Gail (Elizabeth Banks).""Theres nothing that makes a woman feel more like a girl than a man dressed up as a boy"" Banks babbles to Higgins.Kendrick who is also currently co-starring in End of Watch proves her versatility and projects an upbeat affability. The filmmakers were wise to hinge the film on her likable if mildly misunderstood outsider character. The sisterly bonds of friendship forged between Beca and her singing mates are just as important as the results of their big Lincoln Center sing-off. Pitch Perfects engaging mA(c)lange of pop songs and cheeky dialogue makes for good-natured fun. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.

Watch Bernie Sanders Recap DNC Urge Hillary Support on... Celebrities Who Have Left Scientology Pitch Perfect Pitch Perfect By Peter Travers September 27 2012 More News Peter Travers 2012 Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> It sounds like warmed-over Glee. OK Glee itself is now warmed-over Glee. But I got a goofball kick out of Pitch Perfect. This spoofy sassy romp presents us with a cappella rivalry on the fictional campus of Barden U and hits an above-average share of hilarious high notes. At Barden an all-male-all-piggish group called the Treblemakers wins all the prizes at sectionals regionals etc. That means Siberia for the Barden Bellas an all-girl group led by the tightly-wound Aubrey (Anna Camp) who never tires of working tired variations on ""Turn the Beat Around"" or adding an ""aca"" to every phrase as in aca-awesome which gets to be kind of aca-eww. The Bellas need a shakeup and it comes with the arrival of smartass stand-offish Beca (Anna Kendrick) a freshman whose skeptical squint is aimed at a career being a DJ and music producer. More News Peter Travers 2012 Fall Movie Preview All Stories >> Kendrick is terrific taking a role that could have slid by on snide and building it into something uniquely funny and touching. Beca is too cool for this school of estrogen-fueled sellouts. But she figures she can bore away from the inside with the help of some recruits including black lesbian belter Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean) whispery Asian flower Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) and the self-named Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). I have one word for Wilson - Wow From Bridesmaids to Bachelorette Wilson has been tearing it up on screen. And the way she can twist even a cliched comic line to do her bidding is delectable. The script by Kay Cannon of 30 Rock and New Girl has zing to spare. Two judges played by John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks take a cue from Best in Show and drop a steady stream of snark balloons that stop gushy sentiment from spoiling the fun. And first-time feature director Jason Moore best known for Broadways Avenue Q keeps the script in harmony with the songs as Beca mashes up the Bellas music into something retro and right now. Beca breaks the Bella rule against cross-pollination by falling for Jesse (Skylar Astin) a Treblemaker with a jones for The Breakfast Club and the Simple Minds song ""Dont You Forget About Me"" that ends that John Hughes teen landmark. Pitch Perfect is too Auto-tuned and Hollywood fabricated to reach that level. But its still an aca-fun ride and you can dance to it.

"Pitch Perfect star lifts the proceedings - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Pitch Perfect star lifts the proceedings Share Tweet Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 09.27.12 | 724 PM Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Advertisement - Continue Reading Below You understand why Hollywood wants to hire Anna Kendrick. She flatters a producers intelligence. Casting her to do anything in your movie makes you seem smart. Its the same thing for an audience. You see Kendrick in something you dont think you should be watching and its OK. People who dont want to be at a ""Twilight"" movie for instance but find themselves at one anyway? Kendricks for them. Jodie Foster and Sigourney Weaver do that. So do Emma Stone and Kerry Washington. Smart people in dumb entertainment situations relate to them. The college singing-group comedy ""Pitch Perfect"" isnt dumb but Kendricks participation implies that it might also be smart. And sometimes it is. She plays Becca a reasonably cool freshman who aspires to be a record producer. (At the moment her thing musically is the layered mash-up.) Becca does grunt work at the college radio station and reluctantly auditions for a prim vaguely sexed-up a cappella outfit. They perform in flight-attendant getups and chirp their way through pre-millennial hits such as Ace of Bases ""The Sign."" In this world theyre traditionalists. The producer in Becca knows the only way to win nationals is to throw the audience judges and dourly catty color commentators -- Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins -- a curveball. The movie is based on Mickey Rapkins book about the a cappella universe and it nails the music-nerd obsessiveness the gravitational pull of some singers obnoxious talent and the fact that the most beautiful a cappella comes not from the solo singer but from the harmonies wall of sound. For its comedy ""Pitch Perfect"" rubs its showy personalities together. The rest of the cast includes Anna Camp Brittany Snow Adam DeVine Ester Dean and the disarmingly adorable Skylar Astin the boy in the rival group who gets close to Becca by showing her ""The Breakfast Club."" The throwaway lines in Kay Cannons script are so many and so expertly deployed that you basically spend the whole movie digging through the trash. Mostly ""Pitch Perfect"" leans hard on the lawlessness of the stout Australian Rebel Wilson who plays a character called Fat Amy and has yet to find a movie that requires her to pick a character and stay in it. Her broadness and the way its used points to where all comedies starring women seem forced to go the bathroom. I dont object to the two scenes of projectile vomit here. Theyre funny. But once one character falls into a lake of it and commences making the equivalent of snow angels you fear that the movies have learned the wrong lesson from ""Bridesmaids."" For her part Kendrick manages to be absent when the vomiting happens. She can make a lot of things legitimate but she doesnt even bother with that. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Pitch Perfect banks on that magic -- the purely human wizardry of a cappella singing -- though it also attempts to be several other things a mild gross-out comedy a paean to the awkward early stages of new love a Mean Girls-style riff on campus hierarchies. That may be too much for one modest comedy to carry but one things for sure Pitch Perfect doesnt skimp on the singing. Anna Kendrick stars as Beca a newly matriculated student at fictional Barden University. Beca is supposedly a misfit -- were clued in by her multiple ear piercings her ambition to be a DJ or a record producer and her smattering of tattoos -- and shes still smarting over her parents divorce which means shes prickly toward her professor dad (John Benjamin Hickey) and her fellow students alike. But in addition to having a killer knack for mixing beats Beca can sing beautifully. And somehow despite her initial lack of enthusiasm shes recruited to try out for one of the schools singing groups the Barden Bellas a prissy bunch of girls who are actually ruthless warriors when it comes to a cappella singing competitions. As it turns out a fellow freshman who has already expressed an interest in Beca Skylar Astins Jesse lands a spot in a rival singing group The Treblemakers just as Beca is accepted as a Bella. And while the Bellas used to be very picky about the body shape and size of its members they have somehow decided to admit some fuller-figured gals into their ranks Enter Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy who has decided to add that descriptive adjective to her name before her skinnier snobbier fellow students do it for her. i Beca (Anna Kendrick) is an aspiring DJ whose talent for mixing beats may be just what The Bellas need. Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Universal Pictures Beca (Anna Kendrick) is an aspiring DJ whose talent for mixing beats may be just what The Bellas need. Universal Pictures To its credit Pitch Perfect doesnt try to be a big-screen version of Glee. It has its own distinctive self-assured vibe though there are places where the script adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkins 2008 nonfiction book muddles some plot points that should be significant. (Its not clear for example why the Bellas decide to make room for shapelier singers; theyd lost an earlier singing competition owing to a freak projectile-vomiting incident not because theyd favored skinny untalented performers.) And even in a light comedy Kendrick may not be the most compelling lead performer Sometimes shes the wrong combination of chirpy and sharp -- a chipmunk with a bad attitude. And yet Pitch Perfect offers some unapologetically pleasing moments including a crisply edited audition scene that owes nothing -- thank God -- to the protracted sadism of reality TV singing shows. It moves at a clip a sprightly relay race between a dozen or so mellifluous performers. (The movies director is Jason Moore who in addition to having episodes of Everwood and Dawsons Creek under his belt earned a Tony Award nomination in 2004 for directing Avenue Q.) The script features some killer lines most of them slung by Wilson who has a great deal of appealing swagger At one point she approaches two slouching nerds wearing hoodies and asks outright ""What are you two talking about? Dressing for comfort?"" And then theres the singing which at its best comes off as glorious and casual even if its really the result of strict vocal discipline. One of the finest sequences is a ""riff-off"" between the boys and the girls a West Side Story-style showdown that plays out with shards of songs instead of switchblades. The boys taunt the girls with a version of Toni Basils ebullient cute-guy anthem ""Mickey""; the girls rejoinder with a few flirty-cool lines from ""Like a Virgin."" The sequence is ridiculous and buoyant a wonderful example of what can happen when a movie momentarily forgets all the things -- snarky irreverent of-the-moment -- its desperately trying to be.

They fight like the Sharks and the Jets but instead of bringing switchblades to the rumble theyre armed with musical mashups. I smiled for the first half of the movie and started laughing hysterically when a supporting character hijacked it from its stars. The guys group is the Treblemakers the gals is the Bellas. While fraternization among members of the competing troupes is not allowed uber-sincere Jesse (Skylar Astin) is crushing on alt-chick Beca (Anna Kendrick) in a romance that has the approximate plausibility of Romeo and Joan Jett. Musically speaking hes David Cassidy; shes David Guetta. There are competitive sparks between the groups romantic ones between Jesse and Beca and friction within each troupe. The Treblemakers are led by Bumper (Adam DeVine) sexist and arrogant; the Bellas by Aubrey (Anna Camp) a control freak who likes her music vanilla and her clothes to resemble that of flight attendants. Will Bumper stop treating the Treblemakers as his backup boys? Will Aubrey let the Bellas sing a song recorded after 1980? Will Jesse and Beca kiss? Stop asking questions your 10-year-old sister can answer. Speaking of which she would love this movie but probably shouldnt see it because its PG-13. There are a lot of jokes about sex most of them delivered by Rebel Wilson (Bachelorette) as Fat Amy the Australian so irreverent I laughed reflexively every time she opened her mouth. (There is also a fair amount of sex talk from Alexis Knapp as Stacie a glamazon with pipes.) With delayed-action timing that makes her seem slow until her perfectly aimed fast one produces a belly laugh Wilson steals everything in the movie thats not nailed down. When Fat Amy dismisses some jonquil-thin Bellas as ""twig girls"" she strikes a blow for trunk girls everywhere. And she makes a pleasant enough college musical worth seeing just for her brass. Also quite droll are John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks (one of the films producers) as a cappella competition color commentators. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at carriedrickeygmail.com.

Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Friday September 28 2012 600 AM Title Pitch Perfect Film Info PG-13 Crude humor language sexuality. Area theaters. How you respond to ""Pitch Perfect"" will depend primarily on how you feel about its obvious inspirations ""Glee"" ""Bring It On"" and the food-poisoning scene from ""Bridesmaids."" Jason Moores debut comedy which was loosely adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkins nonfiction book undermines itself with gratuitous gross-out gags and easy stereotypes. But overall hes orchestrated a good-natured mashup likely to hit all the right notes with its target audience. Setting the tone from the start Moore opens with a college a cappella contest in which a competitor projectile-vomits all over the judges. A year later the humiliated singer Aubrey (Anna Camp) is determined to redeem herself and her all-girl group The Bellas. Despite constant goading from her schools male team she vows to return to finals and take the trophy. She and BFF Chloe (Brittany Snow) recruit a motley collection of freshmen including the uber-confident Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and attitudinal hipster Beca (Anna Kendrick). Beca an aspiring D.J. whose crush (Skylar Astin) is on the rival team is appalled by the old-fashioned tunes Aubrey chooses. She knows theyll never make it to championships with songs like Ace of Bases ""The Sign."" But can she convince her teammates to enter the 21st century? The movie itself could have used a little more spontaneous spirit and a little less manufactured sass. What it has going for it though is an amiably enthusiastic cast. Though closer to 30 than 20 Kendrick makes a charming lead and shes well paired with the likably geeky Astin. Producer Elizabeth Banks also turns up as a slick commentator with a knack for outrageous assessments. The performer everyone will walk away remembering though is Wilson. She had more to work with in ""Bridesmaids"" but here she sells both clever riffs and dumb fat jokes with equal assurance. At the very least this movie ought to ensure that her considerable comic talents will find an even bigger stage and better material.

And to paraphrase one of the characters in the movie its A-Ca-Awesome. Pitch Perfect Good to great Director Jason Moore. Cast Anna Kendrick Skylar Astin Anna Camp Rebel Wilson. Rating PG-13 for sexual material language and drug references. Aubrey (played by the delicious Anna Camp) is the leader of the Bellas and the one who says things like ""A-Ca-Scuse Me?"" in a way that sounds like it should be annoying but instead is rather endearing. That sums up the movie pretty well. It is snarky hilarious and human and so much better than the awful trailer would have you think. The film focuses on Beca (Anna Kendrick of ""Up in the Air"") a smart rebellious freshman who reluctantly joins the Bellas when she needs to find a campus activity in which to participate. Its immediately clear the group is a bunch of misfits. There is mousy Lilly (the hilariously dry Hana Mae Lee) who looks like an anime heroine come to life. Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean) is hard-edged and tomboyish with a secret -- and no it doesnt have anything to do with her sexuality. Best of all is Fat Amy who adds the adjective to her name so she can beat others to the punch. As played by the wonderful Rebel Wilson Amy generates a lot of the films biggest laughs. She has so much confidence and personality that her weight becomes a non-issue. The movie constantly has fun with its characters in ways that are surprising. A scene in which the women share secrets isnt the heartfelt ""Glee"" moment one might expect but a hilarious -- and gross -- opportunity for everyone to open up. ""I set fires to feel joy"" a deadpan Lilly announces. The Bellas are in competition with the all-male Treblemakers which complicates things because Beca is engaged in an are-we-just-flirting-or-is-it-more relationship with the rival groups Jesse (Skylar Astin) who dreams of scoring films and loves ""The Breakfast Club."" The chemistry between Kendrick and Astin works perfectly You really do care if these two wind up together a necessary element in any good screen romance. The musical numbers are delightful both because the cast performs them so well and because you often get John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks offering wildly inappropriate commentary ""Best in Show""-style. ""These girls could turn me"" Banks exclaims after a particularly rousing performance. The film is written by Kay Cannon who has written several ""30 Rock"" episodes and directed by Jason Moore who helmed the Tony-winning ""Avenue Q."" That tells you to expect smart fast-paced dialogue and musical numbers directed with a fun accessible flair. Youd be right on both counts. Perhaps one of the neatest things about ""Pitch Perfect"" is the way it takes a familiar template -- will the Bellas win the big singing competition? -- but then handles it in a way that is surprising yet completely fulfilling. Once its over its really hard not to leave the theater smiling. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

Comments click to enlarge Pitch Perfect Rated PG-13  112 minutes  2012 In this musical comedy from first-time director Jason Moore a ragtag group of college girls form a competitive a capella group in hope of being crowned national champions. Moore and screenwriter Kay Cannon try to dispel stereotypes but like the sitcom Glee their movie demonstrates such ignorance of human behavior that the characters come across like glorified personality traits (theres a lipstick lesbian a sex-crazed harpy a bitchy blond etc). The musical numbers however are quite good if only because theyre so disjointed from the narrative. With Anna Kendrick Elizabeth Banks and Rebel Wilson playing a character named ""Fat Amy.""

"Pitch Perfect | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; pitch-perfect ) Pitch Perfect (United States 2012) September 27 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Pitch Perfect looks sounds and feels like pretty much every other movie that features a singing or dancing competition. With all the effort invested in the musical numbers the dramatic elements feel like warmed-over John Hughes. And its not even good John Hughes (like The Breakfast Club which is explicitly acknowledged). Were talking Career Opportunities-type John Hughes. Pitch Perfect would be a perfectly watchable pain-free source of entertainment if it was edited down to a highlight reel of various a capella groups covering pop songs but the connective tissue makes this movie seem like an overlong version of the overexposed TV show Glee. The tired plot revolves around the rivalry between two a cappella groups at Barden University the all-male Treblemakers and the all-female Barden Bellas. The Bellas are the perennial also-rans and 2012 looks to be no different until the addition of several new members - loner Beca (Anna Kendrick) oversexed Stacie (Alexis Knapp) flamboyant Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) and scary Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) - shakes things up. But the Treblemakers get better as well by adding incoming freshman Jesse (Skylar Astin). Meanwhile the leader of the Bellas Aubrey (Anna Camp) is unimpressed by Becas ideas about how to modernize their routines even though Beca has the support of Aubreys best friend Chloe (Brittany Snow). Meanwhile Jesse romances Beca and her initial opposition to a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship melts. In true Rocky fashion it all comes down to the expected Treblemakers vs. Bellas battle at the Collegiate A Cappella finals (a real event apparently). A time-honored sports movie tradition is observed by having announcers provide ""witty"" play-by-play commentary for the cable network airing the event (they are played by Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins whos channeling Fred Willard from Christopher Guests Best in Show). Truth be told some of the most amusing lines come from these two. And while the movie pays homage to John Hughes by showing clips from The Breakfast Club and incorporating ""Dont You (Forget about Me)"" into the proceedings it also throws a bone to lovers of true gross-out comedy with not one but two instances of championship projectile vomiting. This is serious upchucking - the girl spills about half her body weight onto the floor. Theres no reason for it except to give Pitch Perfect an ""edge"" (and make it impossible to look at poor Anna Camp without envisioning a stream of brown sludge erupting from her mouth Exorcist-style). The cast is comprised primarily of fresh faces and TV actors. There are a few exceptions. Anna Kendrick is using Pitch Perfect to complement her role in End of Watch (where she plays Jake Gyllenhaals girlfriend); she has been on the fast track since Up in the Air. Rebel Wilson has also been visible in the past couple of years with memorable parts in both Bridesmaids and Bachelorette. (She is allowed to use her native accent here.) Anna Camp has done quite a bit of TV (most notably True Blood) but her most interesting credit could be her in-the-buff role opposite the equally nude Daniel Radcliffe on stage in Equus. Although the basis of Pitch Perfect is Mickey Rapkins non-fiction book of the same name little beyond the bare bone premise of the source material has been retained. Regardless of what the filmmakers claim similarities to Glee are too pervasive to be coincidental. The film in general has a ""TV feel"" to it which shouldnt be a surprise given director Jason Moores pedigree. This is his feature debut; his previous credits include stints behind the camera on four TV series. He also has a background in stage directing which may explain in part why Pitch Perfect comes alive whenever one of the a cappella groups performs. Its hard to imagine Pitch Perfect being a big box office player. Its a genial enough musical comedy but lacks any truly compelling reason for an outing to a theater. Glee garners respectable TV ratings (although those have been slipping) but its attempt at multiplex domination with a concert movie was an abject failure. Recent musicals have not done well and theres no reason to suppose this will reverse the trend. Those with an interest in a cappella music would do better to download the soundtrack than subject themselves to the lame material that drags this out from 35 minutes to nearly two hours.

Beca wears fierce boots no pastels and multiple earrings in the non-fleshy part of the ear that suggests a high pain threshold and a dedication to projecting a tough image. Her goal is to become a music producer but her professor father a fan of academics has negotiated a deal with her. She spends her freshman year at the college where he teaches and if she doesnt like it then hell help her move to LA. The lone condition is Beca has to join a club at the fictional Barden College located somewhere in the Southeast. That way dad will know shes participating in campus life rather than just enduring it while doing as she pleases which is mainly mixing music on her laptop. Between this paternal pressure and some peer pressure from a girl who hears her singing in the shower--Kendrick has a very pleasant voice--Beca ends up in an a cappella group called ""The Bellas."" Natalie Keener Anna Kendricks character from Up in the Air would have dug the Bellas but few others would. They dress like flight attendants right down to the jaunty scarves and are run by a snooty prom queen type named Aubrey (Anna Camp who maybe the Nellie Olesen of the 21st century). Normally the Bellas wouldnt lower their standards to anyone as ""alternative"" as Beca but graduation rates and a mini-scandal have left them desperate for new members. They even take on Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) who calls herself that so that ""twig bitches"" like Aubrey and her sidekick Chloe (a delightful Brittany Snow) ""dont do it behind my back."" (SEE What Anna Kendricks Internet addiction is) Beca is adamantly not a joiner but Pitch Perfect is a tale of conversion of rigid people on both sides of the fence--that is traditional and alternative--loosening up and coming together for the sake of...musical victory. The Bellas want to win the national championship of a cappella. Thats really what its about. Yes theres some business about friendship but that shimmies into the plot too late to take seriously. Especially since the movie has been so resolutely raunchy (vomit has never been used so extensively) and politically incorrect. Screenwriter Kay Cannon who adapted Mickey Rapkins nonfiction book about a cappella competitions makes everyone a target Germans lesbians magicians and especially Asian Americans represented by Becas unfriendly anal roommate and a hilariously soft spoken member of the Bellas (Hana Mae Lee). Unlike televisions Glee which it does bear comparison to Pitch Perfect is free of earnestness and messages of social responsibility. You leave it wanting to sing and dance. Im not sure of the individual talents of the performers but the point is the way they sound collectively harmonizing whether on stage or in a friendly a cappella-off on a Saturday night on campus which is never less than delightful. (READ About James Poniewoziks continuing Glee ambivalence) Theres a love interest for Beca Jesse (Skylar Astin) who also sings and dances but in the Treblemakers a much hipper boy version of the Bellas. Jess is appealing in a refreshingly nice guy kind of way not alpha kind and warm. Theres a sense of decency about his attraction to Beca; hes a little bit Andy Hardy and Pitch Perfect is at its core an old fashioned lets-put-on-a-show story. Thats echoed by the sense of the movie as something spontaneously but smartly thrown together by born performers. Superbads Christopher Mintz-Plasse shows up to lead the auditions for Bardens four a cappella teams shot montage-style. Otherwise Mintz-Plasse has no scenes suggesting he was doing a favor for someone by showing up on set for a day. Ditto for Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins who play Gail and John the Christopher Guest-style deadly serious commentators following the competition and nearly steal the show without interacting with anyone but each other (Banks produced so technically she was doing herself a favor). (SEE Anna Kendrick in TIMEs Great Performances gallery) Under Becas influence the rebooted Bellas slowly creep toward breaking their ladylike traditions (like Glees Mr. Schuester Aubrey favors old-school hits not quite at the ""Going to the Chapel"" level but their version of Ace of Bases ""The Sign"" is very staid) incorporating hybrids of older hits and contemporary music. They do great things with a remix of Simple Minds ""Dont You (Forget About Me)"" and even let Fat Amy be front and center. If you saw Bridesmaids or Bachelorette you know what to expect from Wilson; if not try to keep up; the woman is a comic savant. Shes so cheerily impish that even when its not entirely clear what shes saying--which is often between a tendency to mumble and her Aussie accent--she gets a laugh. Theres a running joke involving the first two syllables of ""a cappella"" being folded into other phrases--Aubrey favors ""acascuse me""--and its the kind of thing that could get old very fast. But Wilson chiming in with a wry ""aca-ward""  and ""aca-believe it"" has such great delivery that allows the joke to soar when it could so easily flail. Her timing is please forgive me acawesome. So is Kendricks. She has a history of providing snappy comic relief in supporting roles starting with her mean girl turn way back when in her film debut in 2003s Camp another movie involving singing and dancing (skills shed honed on Broadway as a tween). She brought a very specific hard edge to perkiness in Up in the Air a performance that netted her an Oscar nomination at a time when she was mostly known for her role as Bellas funny friend in the Twilight franchise. She was so convincing as the chilly little efficiency expert Natalie that in 2009 it would have been considered a leap for her to play someone as sexy and cool as Beca who can rap and deck a guy. But shes been working her way to this kind of stardom from 50/50 where she showed a softer side and even the dreadful What to Expect When Youre Expecting where she had the most thankless role but still brought a little zip to it. In her other fall release End of Watch shes Jake Gyllenhaals dream girl. Kendrick is one to watch; there may be no limit to her versatility. READ Richard Corliss on End of Watch.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theoretically the Bring It On model can be applied to any remotely performative art. All it takes is a certain level of sass some eye-catching performance showcases and a plot where a talented outsider livens up a moribund group with some fresh ideas. Pitch Perfect slaps that stencil onto college a cappella singing groups with a smattering of success. The movie is far too aware of its influences especially when it imitates Bring It Ons silly ""cheerocracy""-style slang with its own overextended series of aca-neologisms. (""Aca-scuse me?"" is possibly understandable but ""aca-awesome""? Really?) But while its essentially a pile of familiar tropes arranged in a slightly new order it gets the basics right enough to be functional. Anna Kendrick stars as a college freshman who doesnt want to be in college; obsessed with creating mash-ups she wants to run off to L.A. and become a DJ. But her college-professor father wont support her dreams so she sulks her way through her freshman year until she gets pulled into an all-female a cappella group run by good-hearted-but-bland Brittany Snow and tense control freak Anna Camp who are facing their last chance to win a collegiate a cappella competition before graduation. (Both Camp and Snow look more like corporate-politics-hardened CEOs than college seniors but thats beside the point.) For some reason Camp wants to stick with cooed sugar-sweet arrangements of songs like ""Eternal Flame"" while Kendrick thinks theyd have a better chance with mash-ups featuring more current music and more dynamic mixing. Also complicating the not particularly complicated plot a rivalry with their colleges all-male championship-winning a cappella group The Treblemakers (led by Workaholics Adam DeVine) and Kendricks forbidden maybe-attraction to Treblemaker Skylar Astin. Like sports movies dance movies and other singing movies (the recent Queen Latifah/Dolly Parton vehicle Joyful Noise comes to mind) Pitch Perfect largely relies on the audiences existing enthusiasm for the genre and its assumed willingness to put up with some cardboard characters and stiff plotting if the money sequences deliver. Pitch Perfect stacks the deck with humor from Rebel Wilson as an amiable spacey a cappella diva who calls herself Fat Amy (""So twiggy bitches like you dont do it behind my back"") and Christopher Guest-style dry comedy interactions from a cappella commentators John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks. Theyre pulling hard to compensate for Kendricks character; teenagers may love and relate to the way she reacts to absolutely everything with a curled lip and mildly horrified disdainful disbelief but for older audiences shes a bit of a self-absorbed pill. Still most people will probably be able to tell whether theyd enjoy Pitch Perfect by deciding whether they can conceive of enjoying a pretty energetically delivered vocally complicated a cappella medley of sex songs including ""Samp;M"" ""Lets Talk About Sex"" and ""No Diggity."" Those who react to the prospect with a Kendrick-esque curled lip should steer clear.

Even if its underdogs-go-for-the-title storyline doesnt break much new ground the very appealing cast (led by ingenue superstar Anna Kendrick) and an overall sense of buoyant silliness advances it to the top of the class. You might have crossed the quad to get away from actual a cappella groups in real life but ""Pitch Perfect"" turns these singers into people in whose company youll happily spend an hour or two. Beca (Kendrick) is a new freshman at Barden University but not by choice -- the aspiring DJ wants to move to Los Angeles to become a record producer but her estranged father (John Benjamin Hickey) a professor at Barden insists that she go to college first. Eventually they make a deal that hell bankroll her move to L.A. if she gives a whole year to school including joining an extracurricular activity and making some friends. Soon shes roped into joining the Bellas an all-girl a cappella group thats hit the skids after soloist Aubrey (Anna Camp) violently vomited on the first several rows at the previous years Nationals during a performance of Ace of Bases ""I Saw the Sign."" Beca becomes one of several odd ducks to join the group alongside the brash Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson of ""Bridesmaids"") who gave herself the name ""so twig bitches like you wouldnt call me that behind my back"" and the painfully shy Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) whose barely-audible utterances provide some of the films most outrageous laughs. Will mashup-minded Beca convince Aubrey to shake up the Bellas playlist? Will the group have a chance at Nationals against their obnoxious all-male rivals the Treble Makers? And will the rules forbidding fraternization between the choruses stymie Becas budding flirtation with Jesse (Skylar Astin ""Hamlet 2"")? Surprises are not abundant in the screenplay by Kay Cannon (adapting Mickey Rapkins novel) but the laughs keep coming from all directions -- ""Pitch Perfect"" offers a wonderful ensemble of loony supporting bits from Fat Amys non-sequitur asides to the ridiculous preening of Treble Makers star soloist Bumper (Adam DeVine) to the unabashed nerdiness of Jesses roommate Benji (Ben Platt) an amateur magician ""Star Wars"" geek and starry-eyed Treble Makers super-fan. Also making this familiar plot worth navigating are the musical selections which put pop and hip-hop favorites through the a cappella meat grinder and turn them into something dazzlingly different. (First-time director Jason Moore directed Broadways ""Avenue Q."") Even the selections that seem like insane choices are delivered with such conviction that their inherent bad taste makes them seem delightful. Kendrick and Astin generate real sparks and the film wisely presents real roadblocks to their relationships as well as a supremely satisfying Big Gesture in the final reel. Elizabeth Banks (one of the films executive producers) and John Michael Higgins add to the laughs as former singers whose color commentary on the competitions make them the movies de facto Greek chorus. Both actors are capable of saying the most outrageous things without ever dropping the TV talking-head tone of voice. ""Pitch Perfect"" is the back-to-school version of a summer comedy but even if youre no longer flocking to the theater just to get some air-conditioning youll enjoy the films breezy sensibility.

Beca (Anna Kendrick) an aspiring music producer whose laptop is filled with homemade beats and mash-ups arrives as a first-year student at Barden University where she thinks shes landed on a foreign planet. Everyone not only belongs to an a cappella group but treats squeaky-clean pop singing as a kind of sorority initiation rite complete with the icky tendency to put ""aca"" (as in ""a cappella"") in front of other words (""I think that were gonna be aca-awesome""). Pitch Perfect is a scattershot annoying cartoon yet for every performer who makes your teeth hurt like Anna Camp as the barf-prone control-freak leader of the Barden Bellas theres one who makes you grin like Rebel Wilson as the tart-tongued Fat Amy. And Kendrick in her first front-and-center lead role has a skeptical and wryly alluring presence that helps deflate the kitschy bitchery. The plot isnt much The Bellas join the Southwest Regional Competition gunning for the finals at New Yorks Lincoln Center while doing their best to avoid the taunting entreaties of the Treblemakers the reigning campus boy group. Without the music the movie might have been painful but the songs Auto-Tuned and processed as they are generate a hooky bliss. Theyre the chewy center of this ultra-synthetic hard candy.

It might have been a documentary in the ""Spellbound"" mold following around the collegiate subjects of Mickey Rapkins non-fiction book the movie was based on as they compete for national a cappella glory. It may have become a conventional coming-of-age/culture-clash story defined by second-act sentiment as portrayed just this past January with the groan-inducing ""Joyful Noise."" Or it could turn out as it has with some of those elements present but more predominantly defined and energized by ""30 Rock"" writer Kay Cannons irreverent sense of humor. (Echoes of Tina Feys screenplay for ""Mean Girls"" anyone?) More to the point Minute for minute line for line ""Pitch Perfect"" rivals this years ""21 Jump Street"" for being the funniest studio comedy since at least 2010s ""Easy A"" and it lands its many laughs without being nearly as reflexively winky as either. Its through sheer force of fun (yeah I know) that one doesnt entirely mind the standard-issue story of Beca (Anna Kendrick) a Barden University freshman and aspiring DJ reluctant to join up with the campus female a cappella group The Bellas. She wants to move to LA but the only way her dad will approve the plan is if she sticks it out one semester and joins at least one club. Aubrey (Anna Camp) is The Bellas exceedingly alpha leader -- ""My dad always says if youre not here to win get the hell out of Kuwait"" -- who killed the teams previous chances at championship glory by tossing her cookies on stage. Aubreys insistence on preceding random words with ""a ca-"" (as in ""a cappella"") falls in line with the ""cheerocracy"" talk of the similarly charming ""Bring It On."" New to the ranks alongside Beca are loud and proud Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson) soft-spoken Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) and butch Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean). Making his feature film debut ""Avenue Q"" director Jason Moore sets the tone right from the start with Universals studio logo accompanied by an a cappella rendition of its traditional theme and he does the performance scenes justice while breezing through the requisite plot points. Becas lit professor dad is disappointed in her active disinterest in attending classes let alone making friends and soon enough -- sure enough -- she falls for nice guy Jesse (Skylar Astin) who happens to belong to the rival team The Treblemakers led by the obnoxious Bumper (Adam DeVine). Naturally Becas knack for making song mash-ups will prove vital to loosening up The Bellas rigid routine. The stuff in between though is gravy. There are some sly jabs at the likes of ""Glee"" though this project may never have been greenlit without its massive popularity. A seemingly desperate reprise to the aforementioned puke gag is then given an amusingly oddball spin and the off-color commentary provided at every formal competition by John Michael Higgins (because they cant hit the low notes ""women are about as good at a cappella as they are at being doctors"") and Elizabeth Banks (""Nothing makes a girl feel like a woman like a man who sings like a boy"") is pricelessly written or improvised and breathlessly delivered. Despite being the groups supposed spark of life Kendrick is asked to trade in her reliably perky charms for eyeliner and frequent scoffing. If anything shes the odd one out by virtue of being the least odd of the ensemble. To that end a fairly funny cast still sees two standouts Wilson finally getting a boisterous role that isnt defined first and foremost by doltish behavior as in ""Bridesmaids"" and ""What to Expect When Youre Expecting"" and relative newcomer Lee whose every psychotic under-the-breath admission (""I start fires to feel joy"") left me in stitches without fail. Bonus points for the films casual but healthy treatment of gay and fat acceptance; each earns a laugh while emphasizing the difference between the closeted teenage panic in high-school stories and the room-for-everyone spirit of any good college. (""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" pulled off portraying the high school end of things recently and well.) While theyre hanging out one night Beca tells Jesse that she doesnt care for watching movies very much because the endings are all the same. Im not going to pretend that the filmmakers dodge their own bullet in that respect but by measure of everything leading up to the ending it hardly seems like such a deal-breaker this time around. Far more often than not ""Pitch Perfect"" lives up to its own title.

TWITTER Jason Moores comedy starring Anna Kendrick Brittany Snow and Skylar Laine is an enjoyably snarky campus romp thats both wildly nerdy and somewhat sexy. Pitch Perfect is an enjoyably snarky campus romp thats both wildly nerdy and somewhat sexy. Set in the unlikely world of a cappella singing this snappy smart-mouthed comedy with tons of music offers choice opportunities for a bunch of young performers to pop out of the crowd while playing game characters searching for modes of self-expression. Girls gays and music fanatics represent the core audience but the good times also should go down easily with a wider in-the-know crowd. PHOTOS Pitch Perfect Premiere Arrivals Anna Kendrick Rebel Wilson and Elizabeth Banks A too-cool-for-you smarminess sheathes the cutthroat competitiveness at Barden U. where on club recruiting day The Bellas an all-female a cappella group urgently need new blood to have a chance of beating male rivals The Treblemakers who prevailed in the national finals the previous spring. With few options The Bellas imperious blond leader Aubrey (True Bloods Anna Camp) and redheaded cohort Chloe (Brittany Snow) dragoon sullen freshman Beca (Anna Kendrick) into the group though shes an aspiring music producer whos only at college because of pressure from her professor dad. Among other newbies are the hilariously self-deprecating Fat Amy (Bridesmaids Rebel Wilson); Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) an Asian Kewpie doll type who speaks more softly than a whisper; and Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean) a black teen so butch that Fat Amy thinks shes a boy. Snidely funny sexual-identity comedy suffuses the loose-limbed script by Kay Cannon (30 Rock New Girl) which ardently embraces the ""organized nerd singing"" that is aa-cappella with none of the self-congratulatory righteousness of Glee. Although martinet Aubrey expressly bans all Bellas from mingling bodily fluids with any Treblemakers which is fronted by the ultra-obnoxious but talented Bumper (Adam DeVine of Comedy Centrals Workaholics) Beca nonetheless is courted by group nice guy Jesse (Skyler Astin Broadways Spring Awakening) a wannabe film score composer whose way of putting a move on Beca is to show her what he considers the greatest movie sequence of all time the ending of The Breakfast Club. Debuting feature director Jason Moore best known for having staged Avenue Q on Broadway sets a quick but not frantic pace and keeps it there; one easily could believe he goosed the actors before every scene so alert are they to everything going on. The unusually attractive cast which is consistently filled with performers well over college age is fun to watch. Among the Bellas Kendricks Beca appealingly blossoms from wary outsider to the one everyone counts upon; Camps Aubrey seemingly would rather die than take off her self-imposed straitjacket; Snows Chloe receives some of the knocks she needs to begin straightening herself out; Wilsons Fat Amy has a hilarious arsenal of quips looks and moves; Deans Cynthia Rose shows the kind of right stuff you always want on your side; and for maximal eye candy Alexis Knapps Stacie is always towering voluptuously and informing everyone how much sex she has. You get the feeling all of these talents will be heard from more decisively in the near future. STORY Pitch Perfect Looks Like a Younger Groovier Bridesmaids Scarcely five minutes of screen time goes by without music be it in rehearsals impromptu challenges or regional competitions leading up to the national finals at Lincoln Center in New York and the bulging soundtrack calls upon oldies newbies and everything in between to be rendered vocally without instrumentation with normally arresting results unless its supposed to sound bad. The choreography is similarly sharp without tipping over into the outlandishly professional. The film was shot in Louisiana with LSU providing the campus locations.

The girls got pipes Youll want Kendricks starring role in Pitch Perfect--an empowerment comedy about a cappella collegians--to tap that furious sense of showmanship. Express the smallest amount of disappointment then that shes stuck in the predictable part of Beca a glum outsider and headphones-adorned deejay who becomes a team player elevating her squad of worn-down gals through a tournament-based plot that rarely strays from the tune. Enough tart details remain in Kay Cannons script (based on former GQ editor Mickey Rapkins dorky 2008 tell-all) to make the good-faith effort go down smoothly. White-bread earnestness is deftly skewered from sickly sweet renditions of Ace of Bases ""The Sign"" to flirtations with blazer-clad everydudes. And even though they ride the gag a bit too hard most of the dialogues variants on a cappella (""A ca-excuse me?"") are winners. A belter does arrive in the form of Bachelorettes Rebel Wilson flinging around confident sass with abandon. Is the presence of a long-suffering boyfriend (Skylar Astin) required? Not really.

As spirited and irresistible as the college a cappella craze it celebrates ""Pitch Perfect"" is a cheeky delight. Without straying from the formulas of such campus-competition comedies as ""Bring It On"" ""Drumline"" and ""Stomp the Yard"" this upbeat crowdpleaser distinguishes itself with a saucy script and a flawless cast led by Anna Kendrick and a scene-stealing Rebel Wilson. While the nearly two-hour laffer could use a tighter trim Universal has a potential winner on its hands provided youth audiences dont feel oversaturated with superficially similar tube fare like ""Glee"" and ""The Sing-Off."" Pic should really hit the high notes in ancillary. Of the various extracurricular activities that have been put onscreen the art of harmonizing sans instruments has long been ripe for this sort of barbed-but-affectionate movie treatment. Loosely based on Mickey Rapkins nonfiction book on the a cappella phenomenon ""Pitch Perfect"" nails the trappings of this increasingly popular but defiantly un-hip musical subculture the elaborate vocal arrangements the self-consciously goofy choreography the pun-tastic group names and the fiercely competitive spirit perpetuated by campus rivalries and nationwide contests. The film opens with just such an event where the fictional Barden U. is represented by an award-winning male group the Treblemakers and their less decorated distaff challengers the Barden Bellas. But when Bellas leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) gets nervous and violently tosses her cookies mid-solo the group loses its shot at a championship title as well as its credibility and most of its members. Determined to stay in the game Aubrey and her mellower cohort Chloe (Brittany Snow) step up their recruiting efforts even ditching their usual membership standards (thin gorgeous white). Their new singers thus include the self-nicknamed Fat Amy (Wilson); Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean) black sassy and rumoredly lesbian; and Lilly (Hana Mae Lee) an Asian-American so soft-spoken the camera goes in for an extreme closeup whenever she opens her mouth. The Bellas also enlist the pics designated protag Beca (Kendrick) a freshman and aspiring DJ with more alternative listening tastes. Per genre specifications Beca must not only learn to fit in with this ragtag troupe but also navigate her ongoing flirtation with Jesse (Skylar Astin) a Treblemaker and therefore off-limits for any self-respecting Bella. Supplying most of the dramatic tension is Aubrey a first-class control freak hellbent on whipping the Bellas into competitive shape with cardio-heavy choreography and a repertoire of tried-and-true tunes like ""The Sign"" and ""Turn the Beat Around."" But Beca an improv artist by nature wants to inject more spontaneity into the setlist; she even busts out some showstopping hip-hop at an on-campus riff-off basically the choral equivalent of a gangland rumble. Conventional though it may be ""Pitch Perfect"" feels like a labor of love through and through starting with the decision to entrust key creative roles to two able feature first-timers director Jason Moore a stage helmer best known for ""Avenue Q"" and writer Kay Cannon a scribe on sitcoms ""30 Rock"" and ""New Girl."" Simultaneously snarky and big-hearted their collaboration adroitly balances musical chops and comedic smarts marked by a firm conviction that the genre in question deserves more respect than it usually gets. From a tightly edited montage of students auditioning on Kelly Clarksons ""Since U Been Gone"" to the Treblemakers smokin renditions of Flo Ridas ""Right Round"" and Cee Lo Greens ""Bright Lights Bigger City"" the musical selections cast a wide net consistent with the well-cover-anything spirit of a cappella. Slick production values lend every number an aural polish more redolent of a recording studio than a live performance though the actors musical bona fides help keep the experience authentic in feel. Kendricks singing talent was apparent in her first feature ""Camp"" (2003) and it again serves her well here; while she goes a bit heavy on the eye makeup in an effort to look suitably dark and edgy her rough-edged vulnerability and whip-smart delivery make it easy to invest in Becas journey. The thesp also generates fine chemistry with Astin (""Spring Awakening"") as well as Camp and Snow both making nuanced impressions in roles that could have been merely one-note. Still in a real sense the picture belongs to Wilson rightfully receiving her strongest bigscreen showcase since ""Bridesmaids."" Socking over most of the throwaway zingers in Cannons script the rising Aussie comedian fearlessly steps into yet another part that pokes fun at her figure and happily reveals an outsized singing voice and hilarious dance moves to match. At 112 minutes ""Pitch Perfect"" can at times be too much of a good thing; though Dean and Lee both get the chance to play with stereotypes their roles tend toward repetitive beats and the decision to recycle that earlier vomiting gag reps a gross misstep in a script thats otherwise above re-puke. Yet the instincts on display are sharp alert and enormously appealing suggesting a project well nurtured at every stage. Elizabeth Banks one of the films credited producers shares a few amusing scenes with John Michael Higgins as hosts of the a cappella competition.
