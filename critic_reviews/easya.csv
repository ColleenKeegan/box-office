The 90s had Clueless; the noughties had Mean Girls; each of them concerned with that age-old problem popularity. Similarly Easy A features a girl caught somewhere between loser and in-crowd. Instead of trying to get a leg up virgin Olive (Emma Stone) pretends shes got her leg over - mainly to shut up her inquisitive friend. Soon the details of Olives fictional cherry-popping have spread all over the school... and then it escalates.Unlike most teens Olive has an altruistic streak and this gets her into trouble. Soon shes agreeing to have imaginary sex with every geek and gay boy in the school to save them from a beating. Branded a hussy Olive decides to dress the part sewing an A on to her clothing in a nod to The Scarlet Letter.And so an amusing exploration of high-school life ensues but this is broader Olive has a maturity that makes her relatable to older women too. Stone gives a terrific performance her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth. Props also to a hilarious Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as laid-back parents. Easy A isnt perfect the love story feels like an add-on a storyline with teachers Lisa Kudrow and Thomas Haden Church is scrappy. But - like the John Hughes films it references - its hard not to love flaws and all.

Thats how Stones character Olive is sketched at the beginning of the movie people brush past her and knock her down; another student whos shared homerooms for nine years just cant place her face. Hey kids of Ojai High this is Emma bloomin Stone she of the green eyes sultry voice and fetching overbite (there are no fetching underbites) the smiling beguiling Circe who in movies of the past few years has been pursued by zombies (Zombieland) Jonah Hill (Superbad) and Marmaduke (she voiced the Australian collie Mazie opposite Owen Wilsons Great Dane). Nobody who saw these films could not see her as the most watchable huggable presence in them. Its an ocular impossibility. (See pictures of pinup queen Bettie Page.) Stones days as the smart self-aware darling in the corners of other peoples movies ought to be over. Easy A which had its world premiere last weekend at the Toronto Film Festival and opens today in real theaters does more than give Stone her first leading role; it establishes the 21-year-old as an actress/personality -- a star -- around whom Hollywood could build some pretty good movies. Is Easy A one of them? Well the film has a saucy 120-IQ wit that it works way too hard to put over. Like last years semi-hit (500) Days of Summer it sweats bullets to approximate that super-cool no-sweat vibe. Director Will Gluck whose only previous feature was the much grosser teen comedy Fired Up is like a salesman who insists on planting his foot in your door even when youve invited him in. But the screenwriter Bert V. Royal does possess a charming voice and an inside knowledge of the trials besetting bright young people. In his 2005 off-Broadway play Dog Sees God Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead Royal reimagined the characters from Peanuts as high-school kids with identity crises. Here he adolescentizes The Scarlet Letter; the title refers to the stigmatic A for Adultery worn by Nathaniel Hawthornes Hester Prynne. Remember Clueless which updated Jane Austens Emma and made Alicia Silverstone the girl of the month? Were in the same class here with Easy A and Stone. (See portraits of Seth Rogen.) Easy A -- which also carries the modern echo of ""easy lay"" -- poses Olive as that favorite figure of movie fantasy the fabulous babe whose sterling qualities only we the audience instantly recognize. (Audrey Hepburn played the role in half her movies.) Precocious every way but sexually Olive has an unblemished school record a fond unforced relationship with her goofy hippie parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) and a discriminating taste in old films; she knows that the 1926 Lillian Gish adaptation of the Hawthorne novel has it all over the 1995 Demi Moore version. Shes also a little lonely. (See movies inspired by J.D. Salinger.) One Friday she tells her busty BF Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) that she has a date with a community-college stud; in fact she spends the weekend alone with her dog and a gift card that keeps playing Natasha Bedingfields ""Pocketful of Sunshine"" which Olive begins by thinking is the ""worst song ever"" but by Sunday has giddily and exhaustively karaoked. Next day she white-lies to Rhiannon that yes she did It. The rumor spreads school-wide and in no time Olive is notorious. Girls whisper their disapproval (read envy) while a half-dozen or so untouchable boys whether gay or just plain repugnant pay her to pretend shes had sex with them. One boy whos not a party to these transaction claims Olive gave him Chlamydia. Someone else is guilty but Olive gets the rap because she looks the part shes been cast in shes taken to wearing a spangled bra and mesh stockings. Why shouldnt she be thought of as the scarlet harlot? In a framing device thats both very today and already overly familiar Olive narrates the film as a webcam apologia for her bad behavior or lack of it. (Note to Emmamaniacs when she was 14 Stone created a PowerPoint presentation titled ""Project Hollywood 2004"" to convince her Scottsdale Ariz. parents that she should move to Los Angeles and try an acting career.) But like Nick and Norahs Infinite Playlist (500) Days of Summer and other recent smarty-pants teen pictures Easy A is indebted to the John Hughes comedies of the mid-80s -- just with a little more attitude and a little less angst. Its cultural cues are mostly from old movies and pop music that speak less to the teens for whom Easy A is marketed than to the 30-something people who made it. (See ""2010 The Year of the 80s Remakes."") You could say the movie like Olive is older than its years. But thats okay since this is one teen comedy that acknowledges the existence of adults not just Olives parents but her favorite teacher (Thomas Haden Church) his restless wife (Lisa Kudrow) and the frazzled principal (Malcolm McDowell who in his early career starred in the Brit school-revolt movie If...). More than her classmates these oldsters are Olives true peers because they realize that life is ever a battle between appearance and reality. I have to say I waged my own battle against Easy A; its assurance rankled me. But I finally surrendered to the scripts breezy intelligence and the movies relatively mature sensibility. As for Emma Stone she didnt have to win me over. She conquered me from the first A. See TIMEs Pictures of the Week. See the Cartoons of the Week.

"Easy A | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; easy-a ) Easy A (United States 2010) September 18 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli Most movies about teenagers come in one of two flavors romantic comedies or sex comedies. Then there are films like Easy A - smart satirical jabs at aspects of popular culture that defy simplistic classification. These may be set in schools but what they have to say goes beyond those hotbeds of hormones peer pressure and academic cramming. Easy A belongs in the company of Election Heathers and Mean Girls - all motion pictures that have outlived their theatrical lives because they have unique voices and use them to say something. The message embraced by Easy A relates to the incestuous relationship between popularity and sleaze - not exactly a surprise when one considers how well tabloids sell and that a cesspool of crassness like Jersey Shore can claim big ratings. People love train wrecks. They love savoring the taste of another persons misery. Thats the reason why bottom-feeding ""celebrities"" attract such attention. The hypocrisy surrounding this cultural phenomenon is not lost on the makers of Easy A who use high school as a microcosm of the world at large as they dissect what popularity has become and what it really represents. Easy A doesnt stop with its central theme but many of its tertiary targets are pummeled less soundly and with mixed results. For example its jabs at religion feel stale and familiar - weve seen these same holier-than-thou caricatures in dozens of films and Easy A doesnt do enough with them thats new or interesting to make this aspect of the film worthwhile. In general however when director Will Gluck and screenwriter Bert V. Royal decide to launch a fusillade at something enough of the barbs stick for the point to be made. Olive (Emma Stone) is as ordinary as a smart pretty high school student can be. In her words if she was a ten-story building Google Earth wouldnt notice her. That all changes however with an innocent lie to her best friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka). Tired of being thought of as virginal and boring she tells the other girl that she had a one-night stand with a college guy. Unfortunately for Olive this ""confession"" is overheard by the schools resident religious zealot Marianne (Amanda Bynes) who also happens to be a gossip. It takes less than a period for the news of Olives sexual exploit fueled by text-messages word-of-mouth and paper notes passed in classes to make its way through the corridors of academia. After that when she helps a gay friend (Dan Byrd) establish his ""straightness"" via a fake (but very public) sexcapade the snowball effect takes over. Reputation outstrips reality. Olive enjoys the notoriety for a time but soon learns that the negatives associated with popularity are greater than the benefits. Easy A represents a coming-out party of sorts for Emma Stone who is being given her first opportunity to carry a movie. She is unequivocally up to the task bringing charm confidence and self-deprecating wit to the part. The way she plays Olive reminds me of Lindsay Lohan in Mean Girls although considering how Lohan has become a bigger-than-live example of what Easy A is lampooning perhaps that isnt the kindest comparison. At any rate Stone never loses the cameras attention even when shes sharing the screen with older better-known veteran actors. The supporting cast is littered with familiar names. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci play Olives loving Mom and Dad. We havent seen parents this supportive since Juno. Indeed with nearly every motion picture family displaying the deepest seediest forms of dysfunction its a breath of fresh air to find a daughter who has a great relationship with both parents. Thomas Hayden Church is Olives favorite teacher Mr. Griffith and Lisa Kudrow is his wife the guidance counselor. Malcolm McDowell with his frown and glare fixed in place is Principal Gibbons. A lot of what transpires during the course of Easy A will resonate with teenagers (who are living through this) and adults (whose memories of high school will take them back). A throw-away romantic comedy has been shoehorned into the story. Its inclusion like some of the broader humor (such as the ""sex scene"" between Olive and her gay buddy) seems more tacked-on than organic. Its not awkward enough to detract but it is not seamlessly interwoven. Without it Easy A would have been a darker experience so perhaps it needs to be there to keep things from becoming too gloomy. Easy A provides plenty of nods and connections to 80s movies and music. Say Anything and Cant Buy Me Love are explicitly referenced but theyre not the only examples. Easy As version of ""In Your Eyes"" is Simple Minds ""Dont You (Forget About Me)."" The song ""Knock on Wood"" also gets a prime position. (Technically Amii Stewarts cover which is the best-known version was a 70s song since it reached the U.S. charts in 1979.) Easy A also references in a rather obvious way Nathaniel Hawthornes The Scarlet Letter with Olives voiceover providing a scathing review of the Demi Moore film version. Its often the case that movies like this which dont follow a cookie-cutter philosophy fail to find a large audience during a theatrical run. Its too early to say whether thats the case with Easy A but despite occasional missteps the film is smart and incisive enough to deserve success at the box office. The marketing campaign is doing the production a disservice by selling Easy A exclusively to teenagers. It is made for and deserves a wider audience. The things it has to say may resound loudest for those in high school but viewers of all ages will recognize those echoes in countless nooks and crannies of pop culture and life in general. Easy A may not be a great movie but it is a knowing and enjoyable one.

Instead of running for class president she pretends to sleep around. Note ""pretends."" In Will Glucks Easy A she doesnt actually sleep around. Olive is in fact a virgin. She just fakes it agreeing to faux-fornicate with the nerdy the needy and the gay -- basically anyone bullied or desperate enough to use imaginary sex to up their social standing. In return Olive earns gift cards to big-box stores and the chance to strut around wanton-woman style in a lace black corset with a large red ""A."" If youre thinking The Scarlet Letter just got the Clueless treatment youre right. High school can make a fine setting for a sassy literary rehash especially if the script (by Bert V. Royal) is filled with brainy canny dialogue and the cast includes Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as the heroines adorably screwball parents. Gluck directs on hyper-drive rattling through scenes with machine-gun timing and a razor-sharp humor flecked with kitsch. (She ""Cest la vie."" He ""La vie."" Ba-dum-bum.) As for the fake-sex thing it all begins innocently enough - when Olive too embarrassed to admit she spent the weekend memorizing a Natasha Bedingfield song tells her best friend (Alyson Michalka) she went on a hot date and did it. An eavesdropping goody-two-shoes (Amanda Bynes) spreads the news transforming Olive overnight into the new school tramp. Then a tormented gay friend (Dan Byrd) asks for help in revamping his image and she complies with verve (""Grunt and make it convincing""). Nathaniel Hawthorne parallels follow. Gluck also directed Fired Up another teen charade with lots of quick-witted verbal raunch. Easy A does a few things better For a change most of the high school students truly seem young enough for high school. The acting is first-rate - Stone nails the waggish dialogue - and some of the loopier routines left me gasping for breath. If nothing else Easy A contains the best ersatz orgasm since When Harry Met Sally ... In the end it cant sustain the hilarity. As my own personal 12th-grader wisely pointed out Olives is the only fully developed character. The rest are stereotypes and entertaining sideshows including Thomas Haden Church as a way-cool English teacher and Penn Badgley as an impossibly perfect love interest. After a while the Hester Prynne analogy and its attendant social travails begin to drag down the script which has a discomfiting premise to begin with This is sticky business watching a girl sell her reputation (if not her body) for OfficeMax payola. On the other hand any kid who uses ""a propos"" in casual conversation is OK in my book. And any movie that quotes Mark Twain excerpts John Hughes and employs a singeing British cussword normally unheard in PG-13 high school comedies - thats all right too. More than all right. Easy A might not ace it but it scores a solid B. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Columbia Mens Palmerston Peak Water Shorts for 15 + free...

You might try ""Easy A."" A gem of a turn by Emma Stone as high school student Olive Penderghast makes this tale of a girl gossip and independence a smart and self-aware hoot in the tradition of the teen flicks of the 1980s. Director Will Gluck infuses Olives story with rousing teen spirit suitable for ""Glee"" fans as well as lovers of ""Juno"" arguably the best teen-themed film of the last decade. With many pop-cultural shout- outs to TV hit music and scads more adolescent endeavors ""Easy A"" might sound derivative. Movie characters past played by Molly Ringwald Matthew Broderick John Cusack are referenced fondly. But the filmmakers have a deft sense of flavor. ""Easy A"" ladles television references and teen film bits into its stew. It builds on ""The Scarlet Letter"" and author Nathaniel Hawthornes themes of innuendo and communal condemnation while making fine sport of the sexual bravado of high school fellas and the speed of blather via Twitter text messaging and Facebook. The movie makes a fine case for just how fluid the motion has become for the young as they leap between all manner of screens. Gleefully arch ""Easy A"" charms right away with a winning scene of pop-music fluffery. Then theres the hook. ""The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated"" says Olive sitting in front of her computer prepared to set the record straight via webcast. Olives troubles began she tells us when the California high-schooler allows best friend Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) to believe she had a sexually frisky weekend. Their conversation overheard by Marianne (Amanda Bynes) head of an abstinence group and self-appointed school savior goes viral. And how. Intrigued by her newly sullied reputation Olive allows the rumor to stand. Then when she agrees to provide sexual cover for a gay classmate the lies branch faster than a time-lapsed photo. Gossip makes Olive infamous. She even finds her outcast status a nice fit with fave teacher Mr. Griffiths assignment ""The Scarlet Letter."" Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow are fine additions as Mr. Griffith and his wife the schools guidance counselor. If Marianne and her ""Cross Your Heart Club"" cant cure her they can banish her. After all they were able to get the schools mascot The Blue Devil cast out. From the moment her character addresses her computer screen -- and big screen -- audiences Emma Stone is appealing. The actress has a little Samantha Mathis a bit of Ringwald about her. Olive is bright pretty in a normal way and usually sensible. ""Gossip Girl"" regular Penn Badgley plays Woodchuck Todd handsome school mascot. Hes the guy with his head screwed on hanging around the edges of the action. As for parental guidance Olives folks are open-minded and trusting. They are also prone to bouts of TMI (too much information). Best they are portrayed by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who bring an amusing ease to the Penderghast banter. Film critic Lisa Kennedy 303-954-1567 or lkennedydenverpost.com.

Enhanced by a wicked sense of humor Will Glucks movie does what Hughes did best showcasing characters with personality who make you wish you had them on speed dial. After all who wouldnt want to head to a parade with Ferris Bueller or get stuck in detention with Farmer Ted? In this case the charming lead is Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone of ""Superbad"" head-butting fame) a girl so clever that even when shes preparing for her first kiss her chosen boy marvels at how she ""talks like a grown-up."" The film opens with Olive broadcasting a confession over the Internet recounting the sordid episodes that caused her current predicament of friendlessness with a side of bad reputation. It all started with a small lie to get out of camping with her best friends hippie parents. But her excuse spirals into a tale of ""sexy Glade candles"" and lost virginity. After that piece of gossip blankets the school (illustrated by some nifty zippy camerawork reminiscent of ""Donnie Darko"") guys she doesnt even know are suddenly bombarding Olive with attention. But when she agrees to help a bullied gay friend by pretending to sleep with him she learns that theres a thin line between sexy and slutty and her stock begins to plummet much to the horror and delight of the schools hypocritical Christians the Cross Your Heart Club. As preposterous as the plot may be the story is bolstered by Bert V. Royals droll dialogue the forehead-slapping comedy of errors and a parade of characters overflowing with entertaining quirks. Refreshingly while Olive is witty shes no Juno. She doesnt try to be cool. Between her favored brand of comedy (rhyming and puns) and her attempts to sound sexy while talking about anagrams she is at least as nerdy as she is hip or pretty. Meanwhile Olives favorite teacher (Thomas Haden Church) and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) each add their own zaniness to the mix and expand the appeal of this flick from teen comedy to all-ages diversion. Unfortunately by the last third of the film it becomes clear that the movie has collected more plot points than it can handle and some are less believable than others. Despite her growing infamy our usually astute heroine decides to flaunt her faux-found sexuality with bustier tops emblazoned with an A -- at the expense of her only friendship. Luckily in a final nod to Hughes ""Gossip Girls"" Penn Badgley swoops in to save the day proving he has cornered the market on cerebral cuteness while harking back to the legendary likes of Jake Ryan.Contains mature thematic elements involving teen sexuality language and drug material.

Sony Pictures By Joe Morgenstern Updated Sept. 17 2010 1201 a.m. ET Theres a wonderful line in ""E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial"" when Elliott and his older brother Michael head off to their classes leaving E.T. behind at home. ""Did you explain school to him?"" Michael asks. ""How do you explain school to higher intelligence?"" Elliott replies. He has a point. Secondary classrooms are what most of us dreamed of escaping from and the longer were out of high school the less receptive we become to high school comedies. Why then am I so pleased with ""Easy A""? Because the movie despite a few flaws seems to have been made by higher intelligence and because it catapults Emma Stone into a higher place reserved for American actors who can handle elevated language with casually dazzling aplomb. Watch a clip of ""Easy A"" featuring Emma Stone and Penn Badgley. Courtesy Sony/Screen Gems. She plays Olive Penderghast an Ojai Calif. high-school student who goes to class in a bustier emblazoned with the scarlet A of an adulteress. How she reaches this point is a convoluted story and a long way from the 1980s comedies of John Hughes; suffice it to say that Olive identifies intensely with Hester Prynne the outcast heroine of ""The Scarlet Letter."" A more immediate question is how Ms. Stone barely out of her own teens reached that higher place so quickly; the answer involves the twin mysteries of talent and growth. Three years ago she made a splashlet as Jules the alluring party girl in ""Superbad."" In last years stylish ""Zombieland"" she was sexy and confident as the larcenous Wichita. Neither of those performances though could have predicted her emergence as a full-fledged movie star. With her agile features Cognac voice and Spritely spirit she makes Olive an embodiment of young sophistication. ""Easy A"" was directed with fearless exuberance by Will Gluck from an elated and elating screenplay by Bert V. Royal. Like Amy Heckerlings ""Clueless"" which drew its inspiration from Jane Austens ""Emma"" this new film is an unrestrained riff on the Nathaniel Hawthorne novel. And like Ms. Heckerlings update the enterprise revels in quasiliterary language. In a preteen flashback Olive tries to reassure an anxious boy ""Dont worry Im not as smart as I think I am."" In fact shes delightfully smart and so is the movie; its bon mots are consistently bon. One of my favorites predates Olives notoriety ""Google Earth couldnt find me if I was dressed up as a 10-story building."" The other follows her emergence as a harlot--a faux-harlot more precisely ""I always thought pretending to lose my virginity would be a little more special. Judy Blume should have prepared me for that."" Olives pretense is the mainspring--or hair-trigger--of the plot. From the moment she tells a girlfriend about an imagined liaison with a nonexistent college student theres no calling back the instant messages or quelling the scandal. Among the things ""Easy A"" manages to be smart about is the madcap virulence of social networks and witty snippets of a webcast provide the narrative structure--theyre Olives effort to explain what she did as opposed to what she kept saying she did and why she did it. One interesting issue the production raises is whether kids will want to see it. I hope they do but it remains to be seen if the ""Im like and shes like"" and ""I go then he goes"" generation can handle the rich dialogue. Another is whether the movies look will militate against its success I accepted the indifferent cinematography as an almost certain sign of a low budget that didnt allow for careful setups or meticulous lighting. According to the story most high-school boys are either virgins or gay; that might prompt some challenges on empirical grounds. So might the unconditional support that Olive enjoys from her blissed-out parents. (Theyre played by Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci and I cherished every preposterous moment they were on screen.) Still another issue flows from the unfortunate tradition of comedy let alone high-school comedy not always getting the respect it deserves. This one largely thanks to Ms. Stones role in it deserves more than respect ""Easy A"" earns adulation for originality hilarity and verve. ENLARGE Keira Knightley Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield in Never Let Me Go. Fox Searchlight Never Let Me Go For its delicate tone provocative themes impeccable craftsmanship and superb performances--by Carey Mulligan Andrew Garfield and Keira Knightley--""Never Let Me Go"" earned my great admiration. I wish Id been affected in equal measure but I wasnt and its not the sort of film you can will yourself to enjoy even though you know that many others will be moved by its tale of romance class oppression and harsh destiny. More Mark Romanek on Videos Vs. Movies Carey Mulligan on Never Let Me Go Never Let Me Go Review Revue This adaptation of Kazuo Ishiguros novel was directed by Mark Romanek from a screenplay by Alex Garland. The book was an exceedingly slow reveal. Ever so gradually did it let the reader know that a key setting an English boarding school called Hailsham in the 1970s was part of an alternate sci-fi universe not unrelated to such classic dystopias as ""Soylent Green."" Ever so gradually did the schools ostensible students discover that they were carefully nurtured clones who would die after donating their organs to long-lived residents of an England they were barely aware of. See a clip of ""Never Let Me Go."" Based on the book by Kazuo Ishiguro ""Never Let Me Go"" stars Keira Knightley and rising British stars Carey Mulligan and Andrew Garfield. Courtesy Fox Searchlight. Im revealing these plot points here only because in recent interviews both the director and the novelist have approved of doing so. As they see it the potential for surprise has dwindled to nil since the book was published five years ago while a knowledge of the premise will enhance our appreciation of the characters plight and deepen our involvement in the intertwined subjects--what it means to be human and what inhumanities may be committed in the name of science. Theyre right on both counts. Its fascinating--or haunting if your mind can defer to your heart--to watch the trio at the center of the story work their way through love betrayal and reconciliation to a poignant peace with their fate. Ms. Mulligans performance in particular is a quiet triumph thanks to the dissonance between her characters dire circumstances and her gift for expressing wordless expectancy. Charlotte Rampling is chillingly effective as Hailshams stern headmistress and Sally Hawkins distinguishes herself in the small but pivotal role of a teacher who teaches kids the truth. If only the film had offered some relief from all that poignancy and resignation. Not comedy certainly nor even rebelliousness since thats ruled out by fidelity to the literary source but brighter sparks of life than the emotional spectrum contained. ""Never Let Me Go"" hardly allowed me a scintilla of hope. ENLARGE Ben Affleck and Jeremy Renner in The Town. Warner Bros. Pictures The Town Ben Affleck works both sides of the camera to impressive effect in ""The Town"" a dramatic thriller that fulfills its considerable ambitions. As the director he showcases fine performances without indulging in showboating and illuminates character without losing a beat of the throbbing pace; this movie represents a big step forward from his solid directorial debut in ""Gone Baby Gone."" (The shrewd taut script was adapted by Peter Craig Mr. Affleck and Aaron Stockard from a novel by Chuck Hogan.) As the star he gives one of those fine performances though its an artistic toss-up between his intensity and Rebecca Halls lovely simplicity. The town of the title is Charlestown a blue-collar Boston neighborhood thats described by a wry opening title as having spawned more robbers of banks and armored trucks than any other place in the nation. Mr. Afflecks Doug MacRay robs banks. He and his crew usually rob them before business hours while their doors are open to receive money from armored trucks. When one robbery goes wrong they take the branch manager hostage--Ms. Halls Claire Keesey--and an unlikely yet engrossing relationship develops between her and Doug. Claire doesnt know who he is since he and the others wore masks and Doug doesnt know how to keep from falling in love with her. Watch a clip of ""The Town"" starring Ben Affleck and Rebecca Hall. Courtesy Warner Bros. You cant blame him. Sweeping away the cliches of her character--the naivete the vulnerability the neediness--Ms. Hall creates a woman whose keen intelligence is exceeded only by her yearning for a new life with the man she has just met. (The intelligence of the writing is best exemplified by a pair of lines that turn on the phrase ""sunny day."") Doug wants a new life too but escaping his family history is more easily yearned for than achieved. That registers most powerfully during a brief prison visit with his father Stephen (Chris Cooper) whos not only behind bars but beyond reach in a permanent state of rage. More Jeremy Renner on Blake Lively and Boston Accents Romain Duris on Dirty Dancing with Johnny Depps partner As a thriller ""The Town"" has what it takes and then some an electrifying performance by Jeremy Renner (""The Hurt Locker"") as Dougs lethally volatile partner in crime; riveting work by Jon Hamm as a remorseless FBI agent; strong acting in supporting roles by Blake Lively and Pete Postlethwaite; percussive car chases through central Bostons narrow streets. And the romantic element though subordinate to the action rings equally true. When Doug says ""Ill see you in Florida kid"" you wont mistake him for a violent dreamer played by James Cagney but youll still root for him with as well as against your better judgment. Heartbreaker ""Heartbreaker"" in French with English subtitles is total fluff though its totality is reasonably agreeable and Pascal Chaumeils comedy cum scenery--mainly Monte Carlo--gives the mercurial Romain Duris a chance to show his chops as an homme fatal. He plays Alex a professional seducer who with two other members of a team thats supposed to parody Mission Impossible gets paid to break up bad relationships. (At least the people who pay him think theyre bad.) Vanessa Paradis is Juliette a headstrong playgirl in a relationship that doesnt seem to need breaking up. The movie can be arch and awfully strenuous especially when an obnoxious nymphomaniac named Sophie invades the premises. But heres a chance to measure its arch before the inevitable advent of an American remake. DVD FOCUS Juno (2007) ENLARGE If youve seen Ellen Page in this word feast written by Diablo Cody its impossible not to think of her when youre watching Emma Stone in ""Easy A."" Which movie is better? Which actress is quicker-lipped? Thats a moot point and an irrelevant one. The important thing is that these splendid comedies and their gifted stars deserve one anothers company. ""Im a legend"" says the pregnant Juno MacGuff wryly when her condition grows all too visible. But the film directed by Jason Reitman is not a cautionary tale. Its a comedy of crisp mordant wit and quietly radiating warmth. An Education (2009) ENLARGE Was it only last year that this tale of an English schoolgirls hard-won wisdom made Carey Mulligan an international star? She plays the precocious and perilously tender Jenny who at 16 finds the London of 1961--one year before Beatlemania--sedate if not downright sedative. Peter Sarsgaard is David a man of the world who offers her the prospect of an education that isnt covered by the syllabus of her private school. Alfred Molina is her father Jack as craven a social climber as John Cleeses Basil in ""Fawlty Towers."" Lone Scherfig directed from Nick Hornbys script. The Departed (2006) ENLARGE Martin Scorseses crime drama takes place within Bostons city limits but it seems to have been made in a state of exultation and holds you captive in a state of dark delight. The basic idea was inspired by ""Infernal Affairs"" a 2002 action thriller from Hong Kong and a classic of sorts. But ""The Departed"" has become a classic in its own right thanks in no small measure to William Monahans script and to a cast that includes Leonardo DiCaprio Jack Nicholson Matt Damon Vera Farmiga Mark Wahlberg Ray Winstone Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin. Michael Ballhaus did the cinematography.

Royal are also grading themselves. While Easy A has its razor-sharp rewards and gives its target teen-young adult audience plenty of reason to celebrate its still a long way from a good movie.Almost by design (I say almost because I dont want to seem too cynical) Easy A seems constructed to break down along generational lines. Its bursting with all kinds of youth-friend hip signifiers mostly in the form of the pop-culture- reference-a-go-go dialogue where everyone speaks in a beat-poet patter of impossibly clever slogans. Does Royal have Diablo Cody-encoding speechwriting software or did he just have Juno running on a loop while he was crafting such lines as ""a gossip girl in a sweet valley of traveling pants?""But amid all this glib and relentlessly hip fun there is a movie that never establishes a story or characters that make much sense. As Olive Stone is great - smart and funny with unerring timing. In an early montage she becomes obsessed with a silly trifle of a pop song (Natasha Bedingfelds ""Pocket Full of Sunshine"") where she goes from sneering in disdain to singing it every second of the day in her room in the shower - that is perfect pop entertainment. Put that on YouTube and Id watch it over and over.If only the movies sum were as good as its best parts but too much of it just falls apart the moment you think about it. In what worlds high school would Olive be an obscure loser? Since when is losing your virginity the cause of witch-trial-like ostracizing? Why cast great actors like Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as Olives parents only to make them sock-puppet characters who are on hand to offer cool-parents one-liners? And really what in the world is Malcolm McDowell doing in this movie playing a small-town public-school principal?Easy A is one of those half-full or half-empty movies. It makes with the clever dialogue and it does present a world where a young woman takes charge and triumphs over peer pressure but the filmmakers were either too lazy or inept to find a way to be hip and competent at the same time.Director Will GluckStarring Emma Stone Penn Badgley Amanda Bynes Dan Byrd and Thomas Haden ChurchRun time 93 minutesMPAA rating PG-13 (mature thematic elements involving teen sexuality language and some drug use) editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

Sign up for our Newsletters. Daily Edition Login to download Easy A -- Film Review 1014 PM PDT 10/14/2010 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS ""Easy A"" is a high school comedy that turns a stale genre upside down with sly wit and sharp satire. TWITTER TORONTO -- If as the old comic apocryphally said on his deathbed dying is easy but comedy hard then how is it every so often a film comes along that makes comedy look so easy? Such is the case with ""Easy A"" a high school romp that turns a stale genre upside down with sly wit and sharp satire. Certainly much of the credit goes to Bert V. Royal a playwright and sometime TV writer who has crafted a smart screenplay that introduces a classical theme into contemporary youth culture. And director Will Gluck keeps the screen busy and vibrant without the current fad of attention-deficit run-and-gun editing. Most of all a young actress was needed to carry the movie. Emma Stone who has been waiting in the wings for such a starring opportunity seizes the moment with such self-assurance and old-fashioned brio that she elevates the game of every actor who comes within her orbit. Consequently the film is loaded with sparkling supporting performances that make the comedy oh-so-much richer. ""Easy A"" has the potential to be that rara avis that connects with audiences below and above the 25-year age demarcation. But to reach that wider demographic Screen Gems will need to market this as a ""Juno""-like offering centering on a teenage girl with whip-smart dialogue and observant humor. The story takes place in Southern Californias Ojai Valley the films first stroke of brilliance as this lovely oasis of natural beauty with a spirited arts colony has scarcely appeared in movies since it was used to represent Shangri-La in Frank Capras 1939 ""The Lost Horizon."" The conflicting interplay of liberal sensibilities and small-town small-mindedness underscores the themes in Royals playful script. You might not quite buy the notion that such a pretty and intelligent student as Stones Olive Penderghast ever flew under everyones radar at Ojai High School. But nevermind -- once a vicious rumor races through the campus Olive certainly takes center stage. Trouble is she is the source of the rumor. To cover up for a dull weekend of doing absolutely nothing Olive tells best gal pal Rhiannon (Aly Michalka) a lurid tale about having a hot romance with a college dude; she more than hints that she lost her virginity. Gossip-hungry Rhiannon is as pleased as she is shocked but the tale is overheard by Marianne (Amanda Bynes) leader of the schools Jesus-freak celibates who is merely shocked. The scandalized teen cant wait to tweet so the social network of Ojai High is soon abuzz over Olives promiscuity. Discovering to her surprise that her new notoriety is more appealing than alarming Olive decides not to deny the rumor which leads to surprising consequences. Another school pal Brandon (Dan Byrd) bullied because he is gay persuades Olive to use her bad-girl reputation to help him fake his heterosexuality. Soon other losers in the popularity games of youth come to her with propositions. It just so happens that while this is going on Olives English class taught by the charismatic Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) is studying Nathaniel Hawthornes ""The Scarlet Letter."" Realizing her newfound identity with its heroine Hester Prynne -- a public pariah because of an act of adultery -- Olive starts to wear homemade trashy clothes festooned with a bright letter ""A."" Her liberal-minded and most trusting parents (Stanley Tucci Patricia Clarkson) latter-day hippies one can only wish to have for parents notice this change in their daughter and do question her about her choice of attire. But they never question her judgment or behavior. So the film makes all sorts of comic attacks on hypocrisy social networking peer pressure false values and double standards. Meanwhile parents will no doubt thrill to any teen movie that treats the loss of virginity in a negative light. If theres any drawback its that the comedy peaks too early in Olive and Brandons hilarious make-out behind closed doors at a raucous party. The film never finds anything nearly that funny in the subsequent ""sales"" of fraudulent sexual favors by Olive to other males eager to establish their reputations as studs. And the film struggles to find anything humorous in the sad demise of Mr. Griffiths marriage to a guidance counselor (Lisa Kudrow) which indirectly involves Olive. The entire movie is framed as a live webcast by Olive to the entire community to confess her false career as a school slut. This allows Stones character to offer wisecracks and wisdom while commenting on this career and everyone elses character-defining response to utter nonsense. The entire screenplay is shot through with zippy one-liners and puns that might possibly make the film funnier on second viewing. The acting is terrific throughout with gems by Tucci Clarkson Byrd and Church as well as Malcolm McDowell as the choleric school principal and Penn Badgley as Olives true love who like her parents pays no attention to rumors.

(Adam Taylor) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday September 16 2010 110 PM Title Easy A If every age gets the teen movie it deserves Generation Text could ask for nothing better than ""Easy A."" Will Glucks high school comedy combines the soul of John Hughes with the arch sass of Diablo Cody and delivers something delightfully new in the process. Expect to hear much more about Emma Stone whos thoroughly charming as misguided heroine Olive Penderghast. When we first meet Olive shes sharing her woes on a much-watched webcast. It seems Olive has become the school pariah in a tale that mirrors the book her English teacher (Thomas Haden Church) has assigned. Just like ""The Scarlet Letters"" Hester Prynne Olive has been humiliated and shunned primarily for having sex with the wrong person. Or not as it happens. What she really does is lie about having sex to the wrong people. Though still a virgin Olive caves to pressure from her sophisticated best friend (Aly Michalka) and invents a wild night with a nonexistent boy. Her false confession is overheard by the campus moralizer (Amanda Bynes) and spreads instantly through school. Once she finds herself saddled with a reputation Olive decides to mess with her tormentors by embracing the false rumors. Alas what seems like a good plan one day can when twisted by gossip and judgment become a disaster the next. And neither her crush (Penn Badgley) nor her parents (the delightful Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) nor even Nathaniel Hawthorne can rescue her Shes got to figure a way out on her own. Youd be hard-pressed to find a misfit loner as confident as Olive who bears her considerable tortures with remarkable grace. But Stone is so funny smart and sweet that we relate to her anyway. While Gluck and writer Bert V. Royal are too self-aware to hit the highs of the 80s classics they repeatedly reference their clever remix feels both of-the-moment and eternal. In fact they shouldnt be surprised if one of the kids who sees it is inspired to make her own teen comedy someday -- complete with nostalgic allusions to this one. eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review Easy A makes the snarky grade - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-CollectionsMovie review Easy A makes the snarky gradeEmma Stone turns in a star-making performance as a good girl supposedly gone bad in this clever yet obvious teen comedy.September 17 2010|By Sheri Linden Special to the Los Angeles Times The story of a smart funny girl who becomes a self-styled Hester Prynne ""Easy A"" is neither as smart nor as funny as it wants to be. With the verbal-cleverness dial set at 11 the teen comedy wears its glib cultural references a pop and 19th-century literary a in boldface embroidery. Much of what passes for fresh in this ""Scarlet Letter"" update doesnt bear closer inspection yet the movie is not without its pleasures chief among them the potentially star-making lead performance by Emma Stone. High school presents plenty of inequities but the idea that Stones Olive Penderghast is ""invisible"" and ""anonymous"" as she claims in voiceover narration is hard to buy. The attractive auburn-haired student is ultra-poised and self-confident a intimidating perhaps but unnoticed? Using broad strokes rather than satirical detail the film paints a teen subculture that delivers some laughs but not the giddy sting of truth A  la ""Clueless."" If its approach to source material is on the level of CliffsNotes ""Easy A"" proves inventive in its plotting A good girl gains a reputation as the schools No. 1 skank after her white lie about a boring weekend turns into school-wide buzz. Director Will Gluck ( ""Fired Up"") uses Ojai locations to good effect setting the tony SoCal small-town scene in which word travels at the speed of text messages. The camera swoops through the high-school rumor mill cellphone to cellphone at the open-air campus. Embracing the role she hasnt earned Olive dons Ray-Bans and scarlet-""A""-decorated bustiers and becomes a kind of saint to adolescent boys with no social standing. Agreeing to pretend that shes slept with them or at least made out with them she soon amasses a fine collection of gift cards for her ""services."" The scheme begins in response to the entreaties of closeted gay classmate Brandon ( Dan Byrd) and the film relaxes a bit from its shrill first half-hour. Bert V. Royals script sets the snark factor at such a fever pitch that the opening stretches have an assaultive energy. As the movie loosens up the humor hits home more frequently. Of considerable help are the warm performances of Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olives supportive somewhat silly parents who speak with the same self-conscious hyper-facetiousness of nearly every character. This is not a film in which all grownups are oblivious or hypocritical. Thomas Hayden Church brings a weary soulfulness to the role of Olives favorite teacher and Lisa Kudrow is scalding and pathetic as the misguided guidance counselor. The movie is on the one hand up-to-the minute complete with webcam narration and on the other beamed in from the last century Olives nemesis is a crusading Christian ( Amanda Bynes) too cartoonish to hit any contemporary nerves. Several characters are stuck in one dimension. The behavior of Olives best friend (Aly Michalka) a self-described ""super slut"" virgin makes little sense and her younger adopted brother is on hand mainly to serve as the linchpin of a gag. For the target audience the nonstop wisecracks of ""Easy A"" likely will carry an electric charge. But its Stones girlish strength and comic gifts that anchor the film which with its overt nods to John Hughes and slightly goofy heartthrob ( Penn Badgley) is soft beneath its hard edges. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESThe Fry Chronicles review Stephen Fry autobiographyFebruary 26 2012Aubrey Plaza Funny personAugust 3 2009Copyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-easy-a-20100917,0,1086530.story",200,easya13,easya,latimes

It updates the pilgrim tale of scandal to the age of Twitter where raunchy rumors travel at almost telepathic speed. The film races ahead with the pace and feel of rushed 21st-century life. The repartee rockets along too thanks to the extravagantly talented Emma Stone whose cool crisp delivery puts a topspin on the scripts barbed banter. In place of saintly Hester Prynne we have sassy Olive Penderghast (Stone) a virginal wiseacre whos invisible to her California schools clique leaders. When a bullied gay friend (Dan Byrd) implores her to pretend that her mad sex skills turned him hetero Olive is a nonentity no more. Suddenly thrillingly notorious she pushes the fib further. After all shes grown up in a culture where scandal is a shortcut to celebrity. Her ruse snowballs out of control however and shes branded the biggest tramp at Ojai High. She cant understand why her life has turned out like a Nathaniel Hawthorne morality tale and not like a John Hughes movie. In the live webcast to her classmates that serves as the storys framing device Olive sets the record straight. As she explains ""There are two sides to every story and this is my side. The right one."" Stone talks straight into the camera and we know her character immediately. Shes a little smarter than everyone else vulnerable she wears a protective shield of sarcasm but shes too decent for cynicism. With Olive caught between what she wants to do and what she should do the film contains a moment or two of piercing sadness but it is mostly tremendously funny. The script is conscious of the cliches and conventions of Sweet Valley/Traveling Pants movies and has great fun toppling them. In films like this a montage of the heroine singing and dancing to pop music is obligatory. Stones flailing. wailing rendition of ""Pocketful of Sunshine"" honors the tradition while kicking it in the caboose. Director Will Gluck has pulled together a powerhouse supporting cast including Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow funny and poignant as teachers stuck in a dead marriage. Amanda Bynes is a delicious nuisance as a judgmental uber-Christian teen. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson play Olives teasing urbane parents lobbing witticisms like top players in a tennis match. Yet the film belongs to the lead actress who is in almost every scene. Glucks camera spends a great deal of time regarding Stones face. Hes not just gawking at her offbeat good looks hes showcasing her talent. When Olives efforts to leverage her trashy new reputation for social and financial gain backfire Stone is by turns outraged joyous regretful bewildered and romantic and she nails every nuance. Shes very funny but also human believable sympathetic and convincing. ""Easy A"" delivers on the promise she showed on the sidelines of ""Superbad"" and ""Zombieland."" It marks the flowering of a luminous new comic star. EASY A  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for mature thematic elements involving teen sexuality language and some drug material.

TRAILER Get a look at Easy A It also shows girls can be as funny as boys something most of us know but Hollywood hasnt often put to the test. The film is full of sharp wit that stops short of snark. And like any good movie it transcends its genre. One of the big reasons it fires on all cylinders is its sassy titian-haired star Emma Stone. Stone is easily one of the most winning actresses of her generation and a natural comedian. Up to now shes had supporting parts in such comedies as Superbad and The House Bunny. With her first starring role she proves she can carry a movie and render screenwriter Bert V. Royals dialogue thoroughly believable. As high school senior Olive Penderghast Stone is keenly intelligent decent and resourceful. A self-described nerd she has a cool side that only her family sees. Her parents (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci both hilarious) have faith in her judgment. Her favorite teacher (Thomas Haden Church) is happy to have a student of her caliber as he covers Nathaniel Hawthornes The Scarlet Letter. Shes the kind of teen adults wish could be cloned. But when it comes to school Olive is less visible than an amoeba. To impress her gossipy best friend (Aly Michalka) she tells a seemingly harmless fib about a phony amorous adventure with a fake boyfriend. The story mushrooms and Olive is noticed -- as the school slut. So she proudly ""maintains the floozy facade"" as she puts it embracing the new persona she has cooked up. She even embroiders a red A on her clothes as Scarlet Letters Hester Prynne was forced to do. For Olive its a quirky if false badge of honor not a symbol of shame. Perhaps this shows how far our society has come. Soon members of her nerd tribe come out of the woodwork. It seems that time spent with Olive can boost their status. Stone follows in the tradition of Lucille Ball and Debra Messings Grace. Maybe redheads just do comedy better.

This question is brought to you by Easy A a sassy satire of The Scarlet Letter that skewers such double standards.The film stars Emma Stone the saucy redhead who always looks as if she has just swallowed a wisecrack. Here Stone (Superbad The House Bunny) lets em rip in the high school comedy that will make her career - and you - laugh out loud.Bert V. Royals screenplay structures the story as the live webcast confession of one Olive Penderghast (Stone) explaining her perceived sins. Like the movie shes in Olive is smart sarcastic and never snarky.Unlike her classmates who rent the movie adaptations of assigned books Olive actually reads them. She knows the textual differences between Nathaniel Hawthornes Scarlet Letter and the movie versions with Lillian Gish and Demi Moore as Hester Prynne. Her Internet confessional explains how she the high school honors student came to be the campus bad girl Ojais very own Hester.It all starts during a bathroom break when her buddy Rihannon (Aly Michalka) pumps Olive about her weekend and Olive makes up a story about a date with a community-college guy. When Rihannon demands further details Olive hints that she is no longer a virgin. Given the immediacy of the electronic grapevine through tweets and texts pretty much everyone at Ojai High knows that Olive is a ""slut"" before the friends even leave the girls room.Rather than feeling ashamed of her new status as a fallen woman Olive embraces it using her bad reputation for some small good. She pretends to sexually initiate other social outcasts (her gay best friend his overweight chum) thereby rendering them cool.Still the smart-mouthed Olive would prefer a real relationship to fake hookups. In one of the films many ironies Olive the so-called school slut is still pining for her first kiss.The film directed by Will Gluck (Fired Up) owes much to Stones buoyant performance one that proves that few things are sexier than a sense of humor. Stone has a throaty voice that suggests an instrument cured by Red Bulls over cracked ice. She has brass without brassiness.Gluck is not a visual storyteller. He depends entirely on his performers and their snappy dialogue.Like Olives spiritual sister Juno Our Heroine is the product of crunchy eccentric parenting. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson play Olives Dad and Mom airily funny hippies who give her their unconditional support even as they over-share about their own personal lives.Less well-used is Amanda Bynes as Marianne the high school Puritan and president of Cross-My-Heart a celibacy club. Even by the standards of broad comedy Bynes performance is cartoonish. In underwritten parts Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow are a high school English teacher and guidance counselor who respectively support and subvert Olive.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickey phillynews.com.

The movie bites off much more than it can chew -- virginity and the double standards surrounding it social media Jesus freaks gay teens and the 1995 Demi Moore version of ""The Scarlet Letter are just some of the targets it skewers -- but its nice that someones at least trying to push us out of our comfort zone. At its best ""Easy A wants to be ""Election at 78 r.p.m. At its worst its just a much better ""Jennifers Body.Any other actress might not have been able to keep up the pace but Stone comes through as Olive Penderghast an over-achieving Ojai Calif. high schooler who finds herself boxed into a fib to a ditzy friend (Aly Michalka) about what she did last weekend. By days end shes been labeled the school slut. Stone a tart raspy-voiced redhead has been working her way up the ladder since appearing in 2007s ""Superbad and she comes into her own here as a happily subversive motormouth. Theres a beautifully edited bit early on where over the course of a weekend Olive caves in to the cheesy overplayed pleasures of the Natasha Bedingfield hit ""Pocketful of Sunshine; by owning the scene Stone owns us. Is this what Lindsay Lohan might have become if she hadnt lost her marbles?The films first shock is that Olive kind of digs the attention. That everybodys staring at her means shes at least being seen and she also appreciates how it bares the hypocrisy up and down the social ladder The boys standing back in fear and lust the girls smiling as they sharpen their claws on what used to be her reputation. When Olive decides to help a classmate (Dan Byrd) whos gay but desperate to appear straight she lends him her newly nuclear persona for a price. ""Easy A steps into queasy but fascinating waters Can someone prostitute who people think she is but still remain pure? And does it matter if she gets paid in Home Depot gift cards?Olive is reading ""The Scarlet Letter in her English class (taught by cool teach Thomas Haden Church) and Hester Prynnes fashion choice -- the big ""A -- become hers albeit with a Victorias Secret twist. ""Easy A isnt a classic-lit teen revamp like ""Clueless or ""Shes the Man; its more a series of sardonic riffs and social observations that spring from the panic around teenage sex -- who wants to have it (or not) and who wants to be thought of as having had it (or not). (For the dunderheaded boys version of this topic theres ""The Virginity Hit also opening today but Id advise you to stay far far away.)Would a 16-year-old girl really relish being pigeonholed as a toxic skank? Is anything in the movie believable? Not for a second but for a while youre having too much fun to notice. Bert V. Royals script gives off rudely witty sparks like ""If theres one thing worse than chlamydia its Florida. Olives parents are played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson as gloriously relaxed bohemians -- theyre the Nick and Nora Charles of Left Coast parenting -- and so what if theyre pure fantasy figures?Less convincing is Todd (Penn Badgley) a lanky dreamboat who knows Olives true nature because -- well its never clear how he knows. ""Easy A has a major crush on 80s teen movies so Todds basically Michael Schoeffling in ""Sixteen Candles until he turns into John Cusack in ""Say Anything.Unfortunately director Will Gluck starts whirling this carousel so fast that the audience gets pitched off about an hour in. Lisa Kudrow turns up as the school guidance counselor -- shes married to the cool teacher but has a big secret -- and suddenly ""Easy A is piling on the plot complications and hyperactive dialogue. The movies still not believable but now you notice. By the final scenes Stone is spinning her wheels and trying our patience Olive has to learn her moral lesson get the guy reconcile with her friend get her reputation back and make sure everyone in school knows what fools theyve been.

That makes her the perfect heroine for a movie that knows the rules of high-school comedies tweaks them but still colors within the lines. In one early scene for instance a caring caustic English teacher played by Thomas Haden Church asks a student to throw him a beat and starts rapping a critique of The Scarlet Letter. He then stops cold and dismisses that sort of thing as the stuff of bad teen movies. Hes right of course but so is the sort of glib superficiality that keeps Easy A floating however pleasantly over the surface of issues it wants to explore. Which is too bad because the film is at its best when it isnt afraid to be earnest. The script by debuting writer Bert V. Royal alternates between genuinely witty touches and dialogue that just has the cadences of wit. Between the rapid-fire bon mots and the equally breathless editing the films characters scarcely have room to breathe. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson for instance are always welcome but their quippy turns as Stones parents feel like theyre working from a parenting manual penned by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. Happily Easy A has two strong elements in its favor heart and Stones terrific lead performance. Stone plays a socially marginalized straight-arrow who chooses to let some false rumors about her sexual promiscuity spread partly because she doesnt really care what people think of her and partly because she likes the attention. As notoriety turns to ostracism Stone starts wearing a red ""A"" in tribute to Hawthornes sexual outcast though the connections between the two works dont go much deeper than that. The plot unrolls predictably but beneath the machinations thinly conceived religious bad guys and hit-or-miss one-liners Easy A has a deep concern with sexual double standards and the shunning that awaits those who dont conform to them from gay kids to sexually assertive girls to dateless introvert boys. Stone plays the part with the right mix of sourness and vulnerability drawing power from everyones false assumptions as she vamps down the hallways one moment appearing overwhelmed by the same assumptions the next. Her performance is only just enough to sustain the film through its creaky increasingly cartoonish back half but it suggests shell be carrying better movies before long.

Comments Easy A Recommended Rated PG-13  90 minutes  2010 For all its homages to John Hughes this wily send-up of adolescent angst owes more to John Waters and Amy Heckerling (Clueless). Emma Stone stars as a high school virgin whose white lie about a one-night stand instantly sparks widespread and vindictive gossip; figuring she has nothing to lose she helps some of her male classmates to raise their dismal social standing by pretending to have hooked up with them. The loony rapid-fire dialogue by first-time screenwriter Bert V. Royal overcomes the plot weaknesses; the Ojai California setting is both Edenic and familiar; and the cast fires on all burners. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson twinkle as the girls supportive eccentric parents and director Will Gluck (Fired Up) shows wicked comic timing and uncommon warmth in an overworked genre.

"Easy A (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Easy A (PG-13) Emma Stone earns an A-plus in first lead role. Emma Stone as Olive Penderghast in Screen Gems Easy A. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald9/15/2010 Editor rating 2.5 Not every moment of Easy A earns a passing grade but what works in this edgy teen comedy works spectacularly well. Borrowing ideas from Mean Girls and Saved with somewhat clumsy allusions to The Scarlet Letter the movie tackles always-relevant issues - that pesky sexual double standard the way even the sharpest teenage girls devalue themselves the dangers of gossip the difficulty of taking responsibility for your mistakes - while being smart irreverant and funny as hell. A lot of the credit for the films success lands squarely on the slim shoulders of the terrific Emma Stone last seen taking up arms against the undead in Zombieland. Here as high-school student Olive her weapons are different and somewhat less effective at least in the short run. Olive wields a savage wit a formidable vocabulary and keen intelligence none of which can save her from poor judgment and bad luck. Exasperated by a friends needling she confesses to losing her virginity to a college boy. The story is a lie; like all extraordinarily attractive young women in teen movies Olive doesnt even seem to date. But the lie is overheard by Christian do-gooder Marianne (Amanda Bynes) and the story spreads across campus faster than you can say ""Text me. Worse generous Olive agrees to help out a gay friend who wants to save himself grief by pretending he slept with her. Pretty soon all the outcasts are lining up to pay for pretending to use her services. The real twist the one that elevates Easy A beyond its teen-comedy roots is that as Olive becomes notorious she begins in a perverse way to enjoy the attention. Shes always felt invisible. Now shes in the spotlight and even if the starring role doesnt seem to capture the attention of her crush Todd (the handsome but bland Penn Badgley who is no John Cusack with a boom box) at least everybody else is looking. Easy A is unnecessarily hard on the religious kids. Unlike Saved it uses broad caricatures of gospel-singing fanatics to get laughs and the bug-eyed over-the-top performance by Bynes (who apparently really should have retired after making this film) doesnt help matters. Other broad comic bits - Olive and her gay friends faking orgasm for example - go on far longer than even the most juvenile viewer will think is funny. But director Will Gluck understands how a strong supporting cast can transform a comedy. Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson are perfectly cast as Olives bright liberal-minded parents; you can see where she gets her quick wit and confidence. And Thomas Haden Church is hilarious as the English teacher puzzled and disturbed by Olives conversion from good student to vamp. A teenage girl sewing an A on her slutty new clothes - for ""awesome she announces - is more than a little ridiculous but Stone makes the act seem possible. If nothing else Easy A should be a breakout role for her. Shes an A-plus. Cast Emma Stone Penn Badgley Amanda Bynes Thomas Haden Church Dan Byrd Patricia Clarkson Stanley Tucci Malcolm McDowell. Director Will Gluck. Screenwriter Bert V. Royal. Producers Zanne Devine Will Gluck. A Screen Gems release. Running time 92 minutes.

Easy A Good to Great Director Will Gluck. Cast Emma Stone Dan Byrd Amanda Bynes Penn Badgley Stanley Tucci Lisa Kudrow. Rating PG-13 for mature thematic elements involving teen sexuality language and some drug material. Qamp;A Emma Stone takes turn as leading lady Memorable chick flicks But there is one big thing that Olive doesnt realize. She is smarter and funnier than any of Hughes female characters from the 80s. In fact with her snappy pop culture references quick wit and exasperated empathy Olive is more Juno MacGuff than a fey Molly Ringwald creation. And with Scottsdale native Emma Stone playing Olive the character pretty much bursts off the screen. Stone has been good in supporting roles (""Zombieland"" ""Superbad"") but shes thoroughly captivating here. Shes feisty and vivacious and projects a completely natural charm. This role breaks her out from the pack of young starlets. Olive leads a fairly anonymous life at her high school in Ojai Calif. That all changes when she invents an off-the-cuff story for her best pal about spending the weekend with a non-existent college student named George. The tall tale quickly spreads throughout the school and Olive finds herself branded with a reputation. The twist? Olive loves the notoriety. Shes no longer invisible people are paying attention and guys are looking closer at her. Its everything she wanted and shes still able to hang onto her virginity. Things take another turn when a closeted gay student (hilarious Dan Byrd currently underused on TVs ""Cougar Town"") asks her to fake a quickie with him at a party. Soon all the school outcasts are begging her to claim fake deeds with them to bolster their reputations. In one of the films wittiest devices Olive trades her fake favors for cash gift cards (she likes OfficeMax and Amazon) and even coupons for Bath amp; Body Works. Things spiral even further. Olive is branded the school tramp by wicked campus puritan Marianne Bryant (a sharp Amanda Bynes). Marianne is the kind of girl who spends her free period singing ""Go Down Moses"" in the school quad. There is a lot going on in Bert V. Royals screenplay which at times borders on the chaotic. Besides the enjoyably fast dialogue which pretty much zips back and forth at a breakneck pace there are also Olives supportive parents (a solid Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). When Olive tells them she got sent to the principals office her mom asks ""Did you win a medal?"" Everything ties into Nathaniel Hawthornes ""The Scarlet Letter"" which Olive happens to be studying in school. This is actually one part of the film that feels slightly forced. Soon Olive decides to tart up her wardrobe and put a handmade ""A"" on her clothing. You understand why the character is doing it but it also seems like an excuse to get Stone into some cleavage-baring outfits. Still the movie is so brightly whimsical and bounces along so merrily little sins like that can be forgiven. This is the kind of movie about teenagers that an adult audience should embrace. Its simply that good and Stone is nothing short of wonderful. Reach the reporter at randy.cordovaarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8849.

In 2010-09-21Sony Pictures Entertainment Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr YOUTH IN REVOLT Emma Stone and Penn Badgley take a ride in Easy A (Adam Taylor) B- Easy A Genre Comedy; Starring Emma Stone; Director Will Gluck; Release Date Wide 09/17/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 94; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted September 21 2010 -- 1200 AM EDT If Lindsay Lohan never makes it back to leading-lady status then we can all comfort ourselves with the knowledge that we have Emma Stone. In Easy A a remorselessly cheeky sociological teen-raunch comedy that attempts to do for The Scarlet Letter what Clueless did for Emma Stone has a speed and sparkle that may remind you of Lohan in her Mean Girls prime. She plays Olive who tells a tall tale about her sexual exploits only to learn that on the digital gossip grapevine of the texting era shes instantly been branded the school trollop. When all attempts to deny it prove futile she fights back by playing up the image dressing in bad-girl corsets accessorized with a scarlet A. But her acting-out routine has a secret saintly side. Shes really helping assorted guys -- like her closeted best friend or a pudgy dork -- by pretending to sleep with them so they can add a little I-shagged-the-school-slut luster to their public images. Easy A has some agreeable fast banter but its so self-consciously stylized that it wears you out. The movie has too many familiar elements like Amanda Bynes as a puritanical/bitchy/Christian BFF. Yet Stone who made her debut in Superbad never loses her flashing-eyed sunny vivacity. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci as Olives goofily empathic parents are a tasty comedy team and Lisa Kudrow as a guidance counselor who is a trollop is funny enough to make you wish that shed land a movie role that does her skewed whimsicality full justice.

To boost her popularity and to sex up her guy pals--and strangers--reputations brainy Ojai California high-schooler Olive (Emma Stone confirming the talent shown in supporting roles in Superbad and The House Bunny) convinces her classmates that she spreads her legs often. But the film gives her no real adversaries to battle except the consequences of her own mythomania--meaning Easy A cant make much of a point about sexual double standards. Seventeenth-century Boston Puritans find their analogue in the teenage Jesus lovers/virginity pledgers of the Cross Your Heart Club presided over by Amanda Bynes but these are foes who no one takes seriously; Olives parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson) are endlessly supportive. What this self-anointed Hester Prynne in Juicy Couture must battle the most is the script written by first-timer Bert V. Royal. Filled with the occasional tart one-liner Easy A tacks on a sound message about a teenage girls right to do with her body as she wishes; the 88 preceding minutes arent much more relevant than as one character snarks ""a gossip girl in a sweet valley of traveling pants.""

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 17 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 312PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Easy A Directed by Will Gluck Written by Bert V. Royal Starring Emma Stone Classification 14A Easy A takes Nathaniel Hawthorne to high school. Yes the ""A"" is the scarlet letter and in these modern times ""Easy"" is how our teenage Hester Prynne wears it. She eagerly embraces the label looking and dressing and acting the part working awfully hard to transform herself into a loose woman and yesterdays moral tragedy into todays adolescent comedy. And the final mark? Well give this proud A a solid B. Its definitely a Diablo Codyesque cut above the norm - the wit can sometimes feel contrived but at least theres wit to be found. Here amid the orange groves of a small California town Hester goes by the name of Olive (Emma Stone) an innocuous femme too bland to be noticed - until one fine morning in the girls washroom she tells a little black lie. Boasting about a non-existent date with a non-existent man Olive crows ""We did it"" loudly enough to earn her an instant rep as the class slut and an immediate rebuke from the class Christian ""I hope for your sake that God has a sense of humour."" Dont know if He has but writer Bert Royal does and the premise neatly kicks in. Convinced that any reputation is better than none at all Olive plants herself at the lively centre of the rumour mill neither confirming nor denying but happy to revel in her infamy. In fact blessed with the mandatory attributes of a female teen in a Codyesque comedy - a sharp mind and a sharper tongue - she gives as good as she gets firing back at her puritanical taunters and of course refashioning her wardrobe to fit her sultry new image. Down plunge the necklines up go the spike heels. By happy coincidence Hawthornes novel is under study in English class where Olive is ready to offer illiterate lit students everywhere this fine advice ""Watch the movie. But make sure its the original and not the Demi Moore version."" Smart indeed - the girl knows of what she speaks. Meanwhile back on the home front her ultraliberal parents (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci) are observing their daughters metamorphosis through their usual veil of ultracool irony. Here too Olive more than holds her own swapping sophisticated bons mots until its impossible to tell the adults from the kid. But thats just another fashion statement announcing that the picture wants to be the high-style brand of high-school flick showcasing its haute-couture banter. Sure its quick its fun but it also suffers from the ingrained self-consciousness that goes with this verbal territory - you know the sort of precocious dialogue where teenagers just sound way too hip for their homeroom. Happily what isnt contrived is Stones performance. Shes onscreen almost continuously the camera positively adores her and who are we to argue with the lens - any initial resistance is soon overcome leaving us in thrall. Sharp but never bitter smooth but not too sweet her Olive is a martini with a kick. As for the plot that attends the dialogue it saunters along like a pleasant afterthought. At first being a compassionate soul Olive puts her bad rep to good use trading on it to enhance the wattage of the schools lesser lights - the sensitive gay guy the lonely fat guy. From there a bunch of rather wonky complications ensue prompting our beleaguered heroine as her life goes awry to cry out in frustration ""John Hughes didnt direct my life."" No but Will Gluck did and dont worry Hes not about to leave the poor girl stranded without tossing her the customary lifelines of true love and a sunset ending. Then again such conventions are always digestible. Actually this whole thing goes down pretty well - in short and in our vernacular Easy A is Easy Eh.

(Photo Courtesy of Sony Pictures) Obviously Abby and Megan and their mother Angela are not exactly what they say they are but whatand whoare they? When the triousing Google Maps and a GPShead off to rural Michigan in search of answers Catfish develops a Blair Witch Projectlike vibe. Maybe Facebook will claim three more victims And here I must stop except to say that the last two words of the end titles (they are including Angela but you wont know what they mean without the context) had me sobbing with joy. Although Catfish is opportunistic even borderline exploitive it gets atby indirection through the back doorthe magic-carpet aspect of this scary new medium. Real people are so complicated and irreducible you know? If theyre real that is. In the early scenes Nevs excitement over Megan seems naive. Hes a good-looking guyhis nickname could be Mr. Adorableand its hard to believe hes spending months obsessed with someone thousands of miles away unless of course hes acting obsessed because it makes for a good movie. And thats where I must throw up my hands because I no longer fully trust my ability to tell real scenes from faked ones especially in first-person narrative documentaries. Parts of Tarnation turned out to have been staged. Banksys Exit Through the Gift Shop was likely a prankalbeit one with its own satiric truth. Im Still Here Well who can tell whats sincere in that Cloud Cuckoo Land? Weve always had to watch documentaries with a skeptical eye with an awareness that realityeven in supposedly fly-on-wall depictionscan be so easily manipulated. But these days its more insidious. All documentary filmmakers must be viewed as potential scam artists. Sorry Fred Wiseman We card everyone. Much of the rambunctious teen comedy Easy A is delightful much of it irritating. Your ratio will vary depending on your tolerance for campfor the Glee-ification of teen (and tween) culture and its incessantly arch repartee. The movie turns on a lie To seem less lame loveless Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) tells her best friend that she lost her V-card (virginity) and shes overheard by the schools Super Christian bovine blonde (Amanda Bynes). Deciding shed rather be viewed as a slut than a pathetic liar Olive sews an A (as in The Scarlet Letter) on her blouse and out of the goodness of her heart takes responsibility for other peoples sins too. (Its a liberal martyrs Super Christianity.) The screenplay by Bert V. Royal is full of cheap shots at the squares but if you dont like one joke theres already another on the way. Lisa Kudrow does a dazzling turn as a guidance counselor whos a flickering mixture of sympathy and narcissism. But the movie belongs to Stone that gorgeous husky-voiced redhead. When most actors deliver nonstop patter their mouths get ahead of their minds but Stones brain works so fast that her mouth can barely keep up. She has a near-telepathic link with the audience She makes our brains run faster too. The Town Warner Bros. Pictures. R. Catfish Universal Pictures. PG-13. Easy A Screen Gems. PG-13.

Director Will Gluck would probably like to parlay ""Easy A"" into his coronation as the Twitter eras John Hughes (he even slips in a clip from ""Sixteen Candles""). But what this high school morality fable really recalls is ""Clueless"" -- a comedy of very contemporary ill manners drawn from classic literature an immersion in the young-adult lexicon and a potentially career-making showcase for its lead actress Emma Stone. Though it forces auds to swallow some cafeteria-style baloney (is the American high school really such a hotbed of Puritanism?) the Sept. 17 release could achieve some kind of wonderful among targeted teens. Loosely inspired by Nathaniel Hawthorne and written by Bert V. Royal ""Easy A"" has a title that might qualify as quadruple entendre referring as it does to a grade; a girl Olive Penderghast (Stone); sex; and Hawthornes ""Scarlet Letter."" When Olives best friend Rhiannon (Alyson Michalka) refuses to believe her pal spent the weekend home alone a frustrated Olive makes up an elaborate story about having lost her virginity to a college boy -- and is overheard in the girls room by the ultra-religious Marianne Bryant (a reference to Anita?) a one-woman Spanish Inquisition. Despite Olives protestations Marianne played with butt-clenching perfection by the soon-to-be-retiring Amanda Bynes spreads the Olive story all over school causing its subject to be treated as a pariah -- just as anyone naturally who had sex in high school would be. Parents will find ""Easy A"" reassuring given that it treats secondary-school students as heartless mullahs eager to maintain a fundamentalist approach toward sexual exploration. This is fantastic of course as is most of the film Few people have parents as cool and funny as Dill and Rosemary Penderghast (Stanley Tucci Patricia Clarkson) and few high school girls are as confident smart funny or hot as Olive Penderghast and if they are they certainly arent as invisible as Olive seems to be. The only reason anyone pays attention to Olive according to this daffy film is her supposed sex life which shifts into a fictional high gear when Olive realizes the good she can do with her ruined reputation She pretends to have sex with her gay friend Brandon (Dan Byrd) so people wont think hes gay (a pipe dream frankly). She has ""pretend sex"" with various nerds kickstarting their social lives. She starts accepting payment in the form of gift cards to Target or Office Max while her reputation goes straight to Chapter 11. You might say she does the time without doing the crime. The idea that Olives supposed promiscuity would be such a hot topic among her peers is plausible enough but if their high school is such a breeding ground for gossip wouldnt the real story leak out as well? Not in the world of ""Easy A"" which for all its edgy jokes and very funny dialogue is a very morally upright tale -- and though Mariannes ungenerous brand of Christianity is lampooned a Christian story Olive takes upon herself the supposed ""sins"" of the world -- homosexuality nerdiness etc. -- and delivers a form of redemption. She even takes the rap when Mrs. Griffith (Lisa Kudrow) the wife of her favorite teacher (Thomas Haden Church) gets in a sticky situation at school. That Olive is a candidate for canonization never crosses anyones mind. Is Olive practicing prostitution? Hair-splitters would say so but hair-splitters likely wont be seeing ""Easy A"" with its silliness over-the-topitude and fabulous leading lady who caps her fresh charming performance with a musical number at the end of the film. No one will hold it against her. Tech credits are tops all around. Easy AProductionA Sony Pictures Entertainment release of a Screen Gems presentation of an Olive Bridge Entertainment production.
