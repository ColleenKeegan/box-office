Intermittently funny and macabre the prize-winning screenplay loses some of its irony through pedestrian screen work and acting. A wealthy man falls madly in love with a sheep in Argentine novelist-playwright Sergio Bizzios directing bow ""Animal"" a surreal black comedy with overtones of Bunuel. Intermittently funny and macabre while taking a good poke at the useless upper classes the prize-winning screenplay loses some of its irony through pedestrian screen work and acting. Pic is most noteworthy for a handful of startling barely offscreen scenes of bestiality which come off deadly serious. Lacking the transgressive sensuality of a filmmaker like Walerian Borowczyk or the comforting explanation that the hero is a loony these scenes are hard to mesh with the films generally farcical tone and could be a little disturbing to the hip arthouse viewers to whom pic is addressed. Subject matter should nonetheless stir up some interest on various offshore video shelves. After 29 years of marriage Alberto (Carlos Roffe) and his socialite frau Natalie (Cristina Banegas) have little to say to each other. While on summer vacation at their ranch Alberto suddenly notices a fluffy white sheep and has his overseer Miranda (Pepe Monje) put it in the barn. That night overcome with lust he gives in to an urgent desire to visit ""Fanny."" Natalie begins to notice a funny smell on Albertos clothes and accidentally witnesses his showdown with the overseer who has also noticed the sheeps attractiveness. But unlike the lustful Miranda Alberto is deeply in love with Fanny. In a delicate scene full of ambiguous nuances he tries to teach her to pronounce his name recognizing what he wants to hear in her inarticulate bleating. He becomes mortally jealous of a black ram and finally stages a marriage ceremony on the lawn to cement his love. Alberto ruthlessly eliminates all those who refuse to understand his feelings and story slips into blood-soaked horror mode. In its best moments the film shows some wicked insights into the characters Natalies exotic paintings all depict herself while Mirandas raunchy pals treat women like animals. Writer-director Bizzios chief difficulty is finding a consistent tone to unite all his ideas. Pic veers from tragic love story to black comedy from irony to gruesome horror without much control. Apart from the severely distinguished Roffe who gamely gives life to the ambiguous Alberto and a restrained perf from Fanny cast has an under-directed look.

"The Animal | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Review The Animal Robert Koehler 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr May 29 2001 | 0755PM PT ""The Animal"" evokes the meeker milder side of the gross-out comedy species. The notion of a comedy based on a guy being controlled by surgically inserted animal organs should conjure up the worst sort of nightmares but pic is stupid in ways that deliver goofiness rather than rampant humiliation. He grunts he growls he whinnies but more than anything else ""The Animal"" evokes the meeker milder side of the gross-out comedy species. Given what unfunny misjudgments and extremes have been applied to the apparently unquenchable subgenre lately the notion of a comedy based on a guy being controlled by surgically inserted animal organs should conjure up the worst sort of nightmares. Pic starring and co-written by ""Deuce Bigalow"" creator Rob Schneider is never more or less than stupid but stupid in ways that deliver goofiness rather than rampant humiliation. Underlying silly sweetness will reinforce aud goodwill promising healthy early-summer kibble. Schneider has carved out a familiar persona for himself as the sad droopy-eyed guy on the outs with nearly everyone. But in the early stages here even before Schneiders Marvin is treated to some ultraexperimental medication those eyes already look like a basset hounds and the effect is overdone. Theres a bigger laugh in the sight of Marvins garage home (where the lift-up door doubles as his home entertainment center wall) than in Marvin himself who is trying to make it onto the police force in the town of Elkerton like his late dad but instead has to settle for taking obnoxious tykes on tours of the station. Hes the object of harassment by creatures great and small from beefy intimidator Sgt. Sisk (John C. McGinley) who looks more prepped for a police state than town patrol to the neighbors nippy pooch. The only spark in this losers life is a sighting on the TV news of Rianna (Colleen Haskell) a Julia ""Butterfly"" Hill-style eco-activist who has lived for months in a tree to prevent its felling and now works at an animal shelter. After badly flubbing the police training course in his fourth attempt to earn a badge Marvin is consoled at a bar-restaurant by pals Fatty (Louis Lombardi) and Miles (Guy Torry) and happens to run into Rianna in the mens room. A funny infomercial for a super-energy drink called Badger Milk inspires Marvin to mail-order a few pints of the stuff but then pic kicks into comic life as a live-action Warner Bros. cartoon when Marvin manning the station solo responds disastrously to a call of a crime-in-progress. Tyro helmer Luke Greenfield stages an unexpectedly astounding -- and seemingly endless -- crash as Marvins car tumbles off a mountain cliff and ends up a virtual sardine can at the bottom. As Marvin comes to his dreamlike images of being surrounded in a hospital theater by chimps and other critters turn out to be true. Back home he dries himself off after a shower by shaking like a dog and bears a huge X-shaped surgical mark on his back with hair growing on his lower hind quarters. He earns his police stripes by sniffing out drugs on a would-be smuggler at the local airport while impressing Rianna by snatching a Frisbee in his mouth. Marvins initial canine tendencies are misleading though according to semi-mad scientist Dr. Wilder (Michael Caton) The only way the doc was able to save his life after rescuing him from the crash was to replace key internal organs from a whole range of mammals and now Marvins life is putting new meaning into the term animal magnetism. The script by Schneider and ""Simpsons"" scribe Tom Brady could have gone down the devolution trail into some hellishly awful business or perhaps worse a second-grade special-effects extravaganza. Instead the spirit is typified in an amusing scene that has Marvin in Riannas animal shelter showing her how he feeds baby turkey vultures or doing battle with an orangutan with a mind of his own. The conflicts with Sgt. Sisk watched over with a slightly comatose eye by boss Chief Wilson (Edward Asner appearing slightly embarrassed throughout) are never more than perfunctory but McGinley -blessed with the biggest jaw in show business -- adds his brand of absurd deadpan. Turning beastly may be trouble for Marvin but its just what the doctor ordered for Schneider who never looks happier than when hes dancing backward across a small lake like a dolphin after rescuing a drowning boy. No thesp of course looks very good appearing like a horse in heat humping a mail box but Schneider generally makes this nonsense far less adolescent than it could have been. Haskell in her feature debut after falling to the wily Richard Hatch in the first ""Survivor"" brings a sweet smile and absolutely nothing else to her animal hugger. Exec producer Adam Sandler returns the favor to buddy Schneider and appears in cameo near the end with the cheer Schneider made famous in Sandlers comedies ""You can do it"" In the aftermath of controversy over Sony paying exhibs to run its trailer attached to ""The Mummy Returns"" pic may be a symbol for some of studio mendacity when in fact its just a sweethearted trifle. It doesnt even fall into the bag of those other lower-budgeted runaway studio comedies habitually shot north of the border Production is strictly a made-in-California affair. Suitably animal trainer Steve Berens is the productions true star.

Rob Schneider plays a man transformed by surgery into something less than human in the low-brow comedy ""The Animal."" BORN IN A BARN / The Animal wallows in potty humor has brain-dead plot 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Evidently its summer -- not because securing a ""Pearl Harbor"" ticket now means arriving at the theater armed with a Taser but because ""The Animal"" is out the first movie of the season designed not to make a lot of sense. Rob Schneider plays Marvin Mange a small-town file clerk/police cadet who really really wants to be a cop like his late old man. Marvin may have a nifty alliterative comic-book-superhero-in-his-downtime name but whenever possible hes treated with an ""After School Special""-load of disrespect. The elementary-school posse that cuffs then goes NYPD on him might be the most demoralizing. Marvins marginalized social status is hinted at by the fact that one of his best friends is obese (Louis Lombardi) the other black (Guy Torry). When officers neighbors and his landladys pooch arent taking figurative whizzes on him Robs whizzing on himself. Rob Schneider is starring with urine. Will he ever score his props? Lets hear it for stupendously dumb screen writing. Driving to the scene of a robbery Marvin swerves out of the way of a circus seal and suffers the most maniacally protracted car-tumbling-down-the-side-of-a-hill sequence since Schneiders alma mater ""Saturday Night Live"" which used to pull the same stunt with ""Toonces the Driving Cat."" Marvin is dragged from the car thrown on a lab table and given a mysterious primitive virility the acquisition of which eludes his memory just as the hair on his backside and the surgical back scars escape his awareness. As the title denotes Marvin 2.0 is of the animal variety but dude whats his genus? As played by Schneider not exactly light-years away from the selfsploitation of ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo."" Marvins part dog part ape part X-Man Wolverine and part ""Six Million Dollar Man"" (sorely missing the bionic sound effect). Hes also part Dr. Dolittle only he does more fighting with than talking to the animals; witness one brawl with an orangutan. Its not long before Marvin is sniffing rears catching drug smugglers in airports and being promoted to precinct supercop. Schneider wrote ""The Animal"" with Tom Brady and they keep the film bobbing in low-grade antics. If Marvin is made of the parts of other animals ""The Animal"" is made from parts of other movies -- ""Alien"" ""Predator"" ""Wolf"" ""Teen Wolf Too."" But with Luke Greenfield directing Schneider and Brady also crafted an arc (yes an arc) that swells from mere nonsense to ludicrousness. Schneider has thrown himself a love interest in the form of Colleen Haskell the ""Survivor"" pixie who spends the movie smiling in the space between blandness and ebullience. On ""Survivor"" Haskell lasted 11 episodes before she was sent packing almost unanimously to do ads for Chapstick. This movie is another weird consolation prize. It starts out as sloppy series of sketches. It ends with a sloppy lynch mob hunting Schneider for the murder of two cows and a farmer. Included in the mob is Torry who begins the movie in a funk because white people are going out of their way to be polite to him. In the films best scene the movie catches up with his paranoia. Its a good sustained Mel Brooks-quality joke. That bit comes along with a howl-worthy plot twist at the films end which is so welcome in its abruptness that its almost commendable.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings Schneiders Animal Magnetism By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 1 2001 Colleen Haskell and Rob Schneider in ""The Animal."" (Frank Musi/Columbia Pictures) Rob Schneider the star and co-writer of the new comedy ""The Animal"" was flacking his film on Leno the other night along with a hideously ugly dog that looked like a cross between a half-dead Chihuahua and a wet dust bunny. When Schneider stooped down to pick up the creature I suddenly realized that my feelings about the beast - a strange mixture of affection revulsion and pity - were not that different from my feelings about the man.Lets face it. Schneider an affable homunculus with hair somewhere between a bad poodle-perm and a mullet is no Mel Gibson. Still he has a kind of Everyman likability and willingness to debase himself while keeping a straight face that makes his propensity for vulgar comedy somehow . . . charming. Plus I cant help liking any guy who would leave a long message on my answering machine just because I kind of sort of halfway liked him in ""Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo"" ""Hey man this is Rob Schneider. Ive got this new movie coming out called ""The Animal"" and I was wondering if you might you know be interested in talking to me. . . ."" Can you imagine any other celebrity sitting by the phone running down the list of every critic who gave his last movie a nice review? (This is where the pity comes in.)As Marvin Mange a man put together with animal parts after a horrible car accident (""radical trans-species-ectomy"" is ""The Animals"" silly name for the even sillier procedure) Schneider gets to regurgitate worms to a baby turkey vulture perform tricks like a Sea World seal drink a tall glass of spackle-thick badger milk and mount a mailbox. Yes thats the movies recurring joke as if you didnt already know this from the trailers Marvin is an animal - actually several animals - as he discovers a newfound lack of impulse control (not to mention the ability to sniff out drugs hidden in an airplane passengers um body cavity).As disgusting as much of this sounds - and is - Schneider manages to make it all more palatable than nauseating genial rather than an affront to good taste. Its also pretty darn funny in a way you just know the same material wouldnt be in the hands of someone like say Tom Green. Just when you start to get sick of the shtick - okay hes coughing up a hairball I get it - hes onto another species (goat dog horse you name it) and you find yourself chuckling despite yourself.As Marvins love interest Rianna Colleen Haskell (yes the one from the first cast of ""Survivor"") is perfectly fine if an example of bald-faced stunt casting. Can she act? Well not exactly but she didnt really need to ""act"" for that Blistex commercial either ""Wow Moisture like youve never felt before""The bottom line is that Haskell cute as a button (no make that a bucketful of buttons) does not embarrass herself. Well leave that job to Schneider and for that we are eternally grateful.""The Animal"" (PG-13 84 minutes) - Contains comic violence and crude humor related to the excretory and sexual functions of the lower animals.

"washingtonpost.com Entertainment Guide Main Page Movies Music Restaurants Nightlife Museums/Galleries Theater/Dance Love Life In Store Outdoors/Fitness  Style  Comics  Crosswords  Horoscopes  Books  Travel  Weather  Traffic  TV Listings The Animal Spoor Excuse for Humor By Megan Rosenfeld Washington Post Staff Writer Friday June 1 2001 Colleen Haskell and Rob Schneider in ""The Animal."" (Frank Musi/Columbia Pictures) The only people who could like ""The Animal"" are those who laugh hysterically when they see the words ""pu-pu platter"" on a menu. Specifically adolescent pre-adolescent and post-adolescent boys. Im not trying to insult their intelligence or their level of sophistication - a few of them are related to me - but lets face it some people find butt and bathroom comedy funny. And some dont.The star and central whirlwind of this cretinous enterprise is Rob Schneider ""Saturday Night Live"" veteran and supporting player in such works of art as ""Big Daddy"" and ""Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo."" Schneider is a gifted comedian and deft at slapstick; somewhere inside him is a Jerry Lewis or Jim Carrey crossing his eyes and trying to come out. The material he chooses is certainly a showcase for his talents - not many actors can convincingly come on to a lady goat - but its so darn dumb that you wonder where his career is headed exactly. (I could make a toilet joke here but I refuse.)The premise of ""Animal"" is that Schneider plays Marvin Mange a would-be small-town cop who cant pass the physical which is an obstacle course devised by Chief of Police Ed Asner that includes being mugged by a karate-chopping old lady. Marvin the police evidence clerk is subsequently left alone in the police station and takes it upon himself to race to the scene of a burglary in progress. On the way his car crashes down a hill - a very long hill - and somehow he winds up in the care of a mad scientist who replaces his internal organs with animal organs. Suddenly he can smell and hear as well as a dog and catch a Frisbee in his mouth. He feeds a starving little turkey buzzard by chewing a wiggling worm and letting the bird eat from his mouth. He sniffs out drugs on a passenger at the airport - one guess where the guy is hiding the heroin - and becomes a hero and a police officer as a result.There are problems however. He grows thick hair on his rear end and finds himself breaking into the butcher shop and scarfing down raw meat. He relieves himself under the table at a restaurant and humps a mailbox when he sees a sexy girl. He also has a problem controlling himself around animals as in one of the few actually funny scenes in the film. He finds himself irresistibly drawn to a nanny goat and advances on her with the smirking moves of a Don Juan in a singles bar. After he salaciously feels her rump she boots him into the ozone. Right on Goatie-dear.The rest of the shenanigans proceed along predictable lines. Theres a jealous cop (John C. McGinley) who is out to get him. There are two buddies who know his secret - Louis Lombardi as Fatty (hes fat and likes pornography) and Guy Torry as Miles (hes constantly on guard against people giving him breaks just because hes black). And of course there has to be a love interest - Rianna an animal lover played by Colleen Haskell. She seems to be officially known as ""Colleen Haskell of Survivor "" a reference to her only previous credit. Shes cute. Almost as cute as an orangutan played by one named Louey.There are some in-jokes that spring up toward the end. Adam Sandler a co-producer of this nonsense and the star of some of Schneiders earlier movies appears in a cameo as does former SNL cohort Norm Macdonald. They portray members of a mob of townsfolk out to get Marvin who by this point is suspected of eating a cow. If I had a mob Id send it after the yo-yos at Columbia Pictures who gave this pu-pu platter the green light. Someone there should be having a cow not eating one.""The Animal"" (84 minutes) is rated PG-13 for bad language genital humor and stupidity.

USATODAY.com - Theres no need to dog The Animal Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 06/01/2001 - Updated 0746 AM ET Theres no need to dog The Animal By Susan Wloszczyna USA TODAY Revolution Studios Rob Schneider slobbers on the still adorable Colleen Haskell in The Animal. The Animal (out of four) Stars Rob Schneider Colleen Haskell John C. McGinley Director Luke Greenfield Distributor Columbia Rating PG-13 for some crude and sexual humor Lets deal with the big question. Colleen Haskell the cutie-pie standout from TVs first Survivor cast remains easy on the eyes in her big-screen debut in The Animal. Otherwise Meryl Streep can relax. Back to our regularly scheduled review. The zooey premise of Rob Schneiders comic assault -- an underdog survives a terrible accident and develops superhuman powers after his body parts are replaced with animal organs -- might lead you to expect a beastly barrage of dumb shenanigans. Certainly Schneider noisily humping a mailbox like Mr. Ed on Viagra and batting his baleful peepers at a goat in heat to the strains of Lets Get It On define base barnyard behavior. And when characters are called Mange and Fatty you can be sure you arent at a Merchant-Ivory film. More like Hanna-Barbera. But compared with his first star vehicle Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo this effort is a baby-step up on the humor food chain. Instead of mean-spirited stupidity or a gush of gross-outs Schneider with his cherub curls and scrawny physique adopts a pussycat persona that engenders goodwill. Its a ploy that mentor Adam Sandler (whos an executive producer) has beaten to near-extinction but Schneider makes it fresh. Or at least less stale. Sure he pees on restaurant chairs to mark his territory. But such monkeyshines arent his fault. He constantly battles his creature-spawned urges -- beaver dolphin seal you name it -- and the resulting physical comedy is bound to trigger your laugh instinct. Schneider starts off as a garage-dwelling loser who aspires to be a cop but lacks the brawn. His main duty at a small-town police station is as an object of ridicule for John C. McGinleys Blutonian bully of a sergeant. When Schneiders car goes off a cliff (stretched to hilarious extremes by novice director Luke Greenfield) his mangled remains are whisked away by a mad doctor who secretly performs surgery. A dazed Schneider suddenly can race like a cheetah and sniff out drugs like a bloodhound. The zero becomes a hero impressing both his supervisor (Ed Asner who gets off a few good doubletakes) and Haskells sweet animal shelter worker while enraging McGinley. But after a snacked-upon cow is found and a hunter is attacked the townsfolk stalk Schneider like an angry mob in a werewolf movie. This may be giving Schneider too much credit but the lad has found a way to temporarily halt the de-evolution of the silly comedy. The Animal may stoop to bathroom gags but it stays out of the gutter.

McGinleySony Pictures Entertainment Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr B- The Animal Genre Comedy; Starring Colleen Haskell Rob Schneider Michael Caton-Jones John C. McGinley; Director Luke Greenfield; Author Tom Brady Rob Schneider; Producer (group) Happy Madison Revolution Studios; Release Date Wide 06/01/2001; Runtime (in minutes) 1; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Sony Pictures Entertainment Posted June 1 2001 -- 1200 AM EDT Rob Schneider appears to be dedicating his movie career to making Adam Sandler look like a pinky wiggling highbrow. The Animal his latest slob-orama vehicle was coproduced by Sandler (as was Schneiders 1999 sleeper hit ""Deuce Bigelow Male Gigolo"") and it follows the masters formula of setting up a hero who is such an egregriously arrested dimwit loser that the art of screen comedy seems to be devolving right along with him. As Marvin a wimpish file clerk with no life apart from his pathetic dream of becoming a policeman Schneider with a contorted grimace and fashion challenged mop that makes him look like the runt of the Brady litter is a put on masochist who revels in his ""Im so unsexy"" hideousness. Following a near lethal auto accident Marvin gets his insides replaced by random animal parts and they begin to take control of him. If anyone else (i.e. David Spade) had played this role the joke might have worn out in five minutes. But Rob Schneider may be the only comedian I can think of who looks like he could honestly use an infusion of animal id. In ""The Animal"" his eruptions of beastly aggression arrive as spontaneously as those sneeze climaxes he used to have when he played the orgasm guy on ""Saturday Night Live."" Whether hes slamming a mailbox in canine sexual frenzy trying to seduce a horny goat or getting into a slapfight with a rivalrous orangutan Schneider as Marvin seems as shocked by his inner animal as we are. The resulting movie may be ramshackle in the extreme (theres no plot just variations on the same low gag) but its a good natured comedy of hormonally charged down in the mud slapstick. The film also features cute as a dewdrop Colleen Haskell from ""Survivor"" who proves at least as winning in the generic love interest role as the Maxim cover babe type generally recruited for this sort of movie. ""The Animal"" while a good deal funnier than ""Deuce Bigelow"" is still destined to get branded if not condemned as ""dumb."" Im not sure however that its even fair to apply that word to a comedy with no pretense of connecting to higher brain functions. In a culture where anything vaguely edgy gets squashed by the consumer marketing machine before it is even born acting like a stupid sex crazed subhuman may be the closest thing to rebellion we have.
