Rambo III stakes out a moral high ground for its hero missing or obscured in the previous two pictures. In the Soviets heinous nine-year occupation of Afghanistan this mythic commando and quintessential outsider is enlisted in a cause that - glasnost notwithstanding - is indisputably righteous. Indeed as this chapter opens the character of John Rambo has been demilitarized and transported to exotic self-exile in Thailand where he lives in a Buddhist monastery and supports himself by engaging in slam-bang mercenary martial arts contests. Richard Crenna has come halfway around the world to Bangkok to ask Stallone for payback - Rambos participation in a clandestine operation to destroy a brutal Russian general who rules a remote province in occupied Afghanistan. The battle scenes in Rambo III are explosive conflagratory tableaux that make for wrenching frequently terrifying viewing. Always at ground zero in the chaos is Rambo - gloriously inhumanly impervious to fear and danger - whose character is inhabited by Stallone with messianic intensity. Rambo IIIProductionCarolco.

"Rambo III (R) Rambo III (R) By Hal Hinson Washington Post Staff Writer May 25 1988 Now that they have had two opportunities to get it down the formula for ""Rambo III"" the latest installment in the adventures of John Rambo is as precise as E=mc2. But as you might expect the calculations here are on a much less sophisticated level. And by less sophisticated I mean like counting on fingers. But working out the formula is all Sylvester Stallone and his associates are doing here. There is absolutely nothing in this third chapter of the Rambo story that we havent seen in the previous two. Yes the movie is full of empty action minimalistic dialogue and more explosive material than the mind can fathom but how could it not be? And yes Stallone has developed his musculature to the point that he hardly seems human. (Oiled up his arms look like varnished mahogany.) Also hes grown his hair longer this time out and this together with the sleepy suffering eyes makes him resemble a Caravaggio Christ -- but with pecs. One could say this installment is less good than the others but then again how do you measure that sort of thing? Ludicrous beyond your wildest imaginings would best describe whats been committed to film here starting with the opening scenes in which we learn that Rambo has traveled to Thailand to become a Buddhist. Rambos not your ordinary Eastern holy person though. Every once in a while he journeys into Bangkok to whup the locals at stick fighting to raise money to help the monks build a monastery. Indeed there are many paths to God. What youre thinking is how could anyone even suggest such a notion without snickering? And its an excellent question. But a good deal of what happens here is so outrageously lamebrained that it verges on camp. And at least then we have something to giggle at. To say that ""Rambo III"" which was directed by Peter MacDonald (who served as second unit director on ""First Blood II"") is back-to-basics filmmaking would be a misstatement of the facts; not even the basics have been grasped. The motions gone through here involve a mission initiated by Rambos Green Beret friend Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna) to assist the rebels fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan. Trautman attempts to draw the stick-fighting Buddhist into the operation but he will have no part of it. ""My wars over"" he says. But the operation fails and Trautman is captured so Rambo has to fight. (No you dont understand he has to) After that Rambo opens fire and many Soviets die. And not in their sleep either. Actually getting Rambo in the mood to fight is one of the staples of the series; hes skittish this grenade launcher and has to be properly motivated. The vets reticence at least as Trautman explains it is the result of Rambos not coming to terms with himself as a warrior. To help him ""come full circle"" Trautman tells him a little story -- something about a sculptor clearing away the small pieces to reveal the beautiful sculpture that has always lived inside the stone. Rambo is like that sculpture he says. ""We didnt make you an incredible fighting machine. We just cleared away the small pieces."" In subsequent scenes Rambo ponders this deeply and perhaps theres nothing more wonderful -- or funnier -- in modern movies than watching Rambo think. Or try to think. Watching him turn this nugget over and over in his mind youd think you were witnessing the very birth of human thought. Its in scenes like this one that we see how completely the star has given up even the pretense of being an actor. All of Stallones preparation for the role seems to have been done in the weight room; hes become the chief exponent of the Mr. Universe school of acting. The camera pays such loving attention to the definition in his lats that the movie becomes merely an exercise in self-worship. Its Stallones 63 million valentine to his own lusciousness. There have been some minor refinements though that hardly seems like quite the right word. It is marginally less offensive I suppose to have Rambo killing Reds in Afghanistan than killing Reds in Vietnam. (This way racism isnt so prominent an aspect of the movies rabid patriotism.) Then again having an Afghan rebel speechify about the barbarism of the Soviets just as the their troops are pulling out has its down side as does the films idealization of the mujaheddin (who are characterized here as ""freedom fighters""). To claim that the Rambo films have a political attitude is to dignify what is essentially a kind of reactionary paranoia. Its philosophy is basically a collection of the kind of sludgy borderline-fascist sentiments you hear expressed at 3 in the morning on call-in radio shows. And perhaps the most malignant aspect of the Rambo phenomenon is the effectiveness with which Stallone has exploited these notions. But Rambo may in fact have outlived his usefulness. His moment may have passed. To some extent in the first film but especially in the second Rambo was the articulation of unexpressed sentiments in the culture a projection of some of our baser national needs. And in that sense the character may have served a useful mythic function. In the earlier films there was a sense of mission of passion even mixed in with the filmmakers calculations; here only their moneymaking impulses are engaged. This time it was for his friend the ad line says. But who are they trying to kid? This time it was for the dough. ""Rambo III"" contains a great deal of graphic violence and strong language.

"Rambo III (R) Rambo III (R) By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer May 27 1988 Once again John Rambo guns amok in the name of American democracy but he packs less dramatic firepower than last time. ""Rambo III"" a poorly paced much less involving show of guns and machismo makes you miss ""Rambo II"" (okay ""Rambo First Blood Part II""). Special Forces vet Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is cooling out in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand (possibly hiding from Brigitte Nielsen). Content with helping monks fix their pagodas (and fund-raising for the temple by stickfighting Asian toughs for money) hes getting dis spiritual peace ya know. So when Col. Samuel Trautman (Richard Crenna) his perennial recruiter asks him to help out the Afghan Mujaheddin Rambo refuses. But when Trautman gets captured there by the Soviets -- and since ""Rambos"" producers are paying Stallone 20 million -- he heads for Afghanistan as filmed in Israel. Trautmans being held in a Soviet prison camp run by Col. Zaysen (French actor Marc de Jonge) a thick-accented regional commander who must have seen too many James Bond films and likes firebombing villages filled with women and children. Rambo must use guns detonators state-of-the-art helicopters his slice-and-dice knife and those bomb-tipped bows and arrows to spring his buddy. Because the movies ""dedicated to the gallant people of Afghanistan"" his mission also includes getting to Love-Dee-Peeple. Thus we hear talk from an Afghan rebel about The Eternal Struggle and Rambo plays something like horse polo -- a sheeps carcass substituting for the ball -- with the local friendly freedom fighters. Along the meandering way the filmmakers invoke a little ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" ""The Man Who Would Be King"" and ""The Living Daylights"" -- films that have all visited this rocky terrain before. And when our laconic palooka gets followed by Hamid an adoring Afghan kid who gee-whizzes behind Rambo all the way to the prison camp you begin to wonder if Steven Spielberg didnt drop in on the concept lunch. The finale involves industrial-strength gunfighting in an underground cavern then a finale in the desert against tanks armored cars and special-force Soviet soldiers. But all this weaponry doesnt pack enough punch. Stallone scripts the wall-to-wall explosions too haphazardly and unimaginatively the only exception being Rambos killing of a Soviet goon by hanging and detonation. ""I hate to admit it"" Trautman tells Rambo at one point. ""But I think were getting a little soft."" ""Maybe just a little"" says Rambo.
