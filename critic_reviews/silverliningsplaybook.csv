Laurie Sparham/Focus Features hide caption toggle caption Laurie Sparham/Focus Features Leo Tolstoys Countess Vronsky (Olivia Williams) and Anna (Keira Knightley) come to life in Joe Wrights adaptation of the classic Russian novel Anna Karenina. Laurie Sparham/Focus Features Anna Karenina Director Joe Wright Genre Drama Running time 130 minutes Rated R for some sexuality and violence With Keira Knightley Matthew Macfadyen Jude Law Its the sort of juxtaposition that often arises at this time of year novel adaptations arriving in droves at movie theaters hunting for Oscar nominations. J.R.R. Tolkiens fantastical The Hobbit and Yann Martels lifeboat adventure Life of Pi are coming soon and this week Leo Tolstoys romantic tragedy Anna Karenina goes head to head with Matthew Quicks romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook. Quicks novel centers on Pat a bipolar guy sprung by his mom from a mental institution before hes quite ready who has a theory that his life is a movie written and produced by God. In David O. Russells film God gets left out of the mix. But Pat played by Bradley Cooper still has plenty of theories. ""This is what I believe to be true"" he says at one point. ""You have to do everything you can you have to work your hardest and if you stay positive you have a shot at a silver lining."" Silver linings of course come with clouds and Pat has plenty scudding through his life He is living with his folks because his wife with whom hes determined to reconnect got a restraining order against him. And hes a chip off the old block His bookmaking dad (Robert De Niro) is obsessive-compulsive especially when it comes to the Philadelphia Eagles. And against the advice of his therapist (the stellar Anupam Kher) Pat is not taking his medication -- a point that provides a conversation-starter when he meets Tiffany a recent widow whos just as fragile (and formerly medicated) as he is. i Bradley Cooper stars as a bipolar high school teacher in Silver Linings Playbook. The Weinstein Company hide caption toggle caption The Weinstein Company Bradley Cooper stars as a bipolar high school teacher in Silver Linings Playbook. The Weinstein Company Silver Linings Playbook Director David O. Russell Genre Drama Comedy Running time 122 minutes Rated R for language and some sexual content/nudity With Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Played by Jennifer Lawrence Tiffany is working through her own issues by prepping for a dance competition -- one that shell try to rope Pat into -- but if that makes her sound like shes got her act together she makes Pat seem downright stable in other respects. Writer-director Russell is just the guy to bring out (and then calm) the manic dysfunction in these folks. Thats kind of been his thing in everything from I Heart Huckabees to The Fighter. In taking Silver Linings Playbook from page to screen Russell embraces some pretty conventional notions about the curative power of family and friends but he makes that embrace bracing with frenetic editing that puts you inside the heads of his troubled leads. The performances -- including a grounded turn by Jacki Weaver as Pats mom and a manic one by Chris Tucker as his best friend from the asylum -- are this films chief silver lining. Also a dance sequence that allows the director a subversively bipolar Cinderella joke just before the climax. Theres a ball scene in Tolstoys Anna Karenina too -- one thats figured in more than 20 movie adaptations so you may think you know it but its rarely been quite this theatrical. Aaron Taylor-Johnsons Count Vronsky tells Keira Knightleys Anna that if she wont dance with him hes ""getting out of this operetta"" and going home -- and with Tom Stoppard penning the screenplay you know youre meant to hear that word ""operetta"" in a near-literal sense. Lush and literally staged to within an inch of its cinematic life director Joe Wrights Anna Karenina is built around the premise that life for 19th-century Russian aristocrats was a kind of performance. They looked to Paris for fashion and to the rest of Europe for sophistication; they played their parts in public. So the director places them in a literal theater -- sometimes with an actual audience out front. Knightleys Anna argues with stodgy husband Jude Law on what is clearly a stage set -- but when she turns her back on this artificial society and steps into the wings snow is falling and Vronsky is there. The performances are grand and oversized with Laws frustrated husband the still center around whom adultery swirls. Everyone but Law moves in elegant choreographed patterns as stage doors open out onto wheat fields fireworks explode right through the theaters domed roof and racing horses gallop across the proscenium stage. Nothing about this movie is tidy or realistic -- its sweeping and theatrical to suit the storys sweeping theatrical emotions. And if the inventive imagery the director has come up with distances you a bit from those emotions hes still made Anna Karenina -- in which theres no silver lining for anyone -- a wild gorgeous and flamboyant ride.

Russell Jennifer Lawrence Movies Our Picks Our Picks Movies Romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook Entertainment News We get thrown right into the middle of Pat Solitano Jr.s troubled life story without any of the usual context or background. Played by Bradley Cooper in a major departure from his customary sleek pretty-boy roles Pat is the unhinged overly intense and not always likable protagonist of David O. Russells manic inventive and rewarding ""Silver Linings Playbook."" When we first meet him hes standing in the corner of his spartan room in a Baltimore mental hospital talking to himself. His mom played by the terrific Australian actress Jacki Weaver has shown up from Philadelphia to sign him out against doctors orders and without having consulted her husband. What did Pat do that got him locked up in the first place? Whats going on with this family? Why do Pats wife and the school where he used to teach have restraining orders against him?Answers to those questions wont come into focus for a while although you may rapidly reach the conclusion that the doctors were right and Pat would be better off heavily medicated and under psychiatric care. Back in the familys Philly neighborhood with its slightly desperate upper-fringe-of-the-working-class feeling Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) has no idea his younger son is returning home. One of the best and inarguably funniest roles of De Niros recent oddball supporting career Pat Sr. fronts as an Italian-American tough guy but is more like a barely glued together mass of neuroses a failing bookie with a penchant for disastrous side bets and an intense OCD relationship with the Philadelphia Eagles. (His wardrobe gets better and better as the movie progresses; I cant stand football but I want Pat Sr.s Eagles-green cardigan.)As for Pat Jr. whose apparel frequently involves a shapeless gray track suit topped with a black garbage bag - so he can sweat off weight as he runs - his first item of business is studying up on the high-school English syllabus his estranged wife Nikki is teaching in hopes of impressing her at some unspecified future date. (Nikki plays an important role in Pats story but almost entirely through her absence.) This leads however to Pat flinging a copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"" through a closed window at 4 oclock in the morning and awakening his parents with a maniacal rant against Ernest Hemingway. (He refuses to apologize blaming Hemingway. Pat Sr. says rather mildly ""Tell Ernest Hemingway to come down here and apologize to us in person."") I cant help detecting a genre commentary of sorts here whether it originates with Russell (who also wrote the script) or Matthew Quick author of the original novel Hemingway was writing one kind of story which purports to depict the tragedies of the real world in the 20th century and does not demand a happy ending. This is the other kind of story.In fact ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a romantic comedy even if it doesnt feel like one at first. Furthermore its a rom-com that succeeds in revitalizing that discredited genre where so many others have failed injecting it with the grit and emotion of realist drama rather than with amped-up whimsy or social satire or montages of people walking on the beach while whiny emo-pop plays on the soundtrack. As he did with the boxing movie in ""The Fighter"" Russell proves that you can breathe new life into one of the hoariest forms in the Hollywood lexicon. He takes a movie where everyone in the audience knows how it will end and makes us suspend our disbelief and fall in love all over again. (After an entire decade in the indie-film wilderness following his 1999 breakthrough with ""Three Kings"" Russell seems to have found himself a niche reinventing classic movie genres.) You Might Also Like It helps of course that weve got a dynamite couple to fall in love with. Russell has long had a flair for unexpected casting combinations but I really didnt expect Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence to be such a combustible duo. (Yes in real life theres a significant age spread between these two Cooper is 37 and Lawrence 22. At the risk of sounding like a total sexist pig it doesnt play that way on-screen.) Finally getting unleashed from his immensely lucrative ""Hangover"" roles and a series of tepid leading-man movies Cooper gives a twitchy physical marvelously alive performance as Pat Jr. whos barely aware how poor his impulse control is and doesnt seem to notice that his face is often marred with mysterious scars and bruises. As for Lawrence shes been in so many movies lately that shes in danger of being overexposed but I only wish her chaste and cautious performance as Katniss Everdeen had one-third of the fire she shows here as Tiffany a grieving widow going through a spectacular meltdown of her own.There have been dozens if not hundreds of other movies about two damaged people who find each other and quite a few that try to wring bittersweet laughs out of the painful struggle with mental illness. But its always wonderfully satisfying to see a conventional or archetypal story structure handled with this level of craft and enthusiasm. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" never feels like a movie youve seen before even if Pat and Tiffanys ultimate destination is clear the moment they meet. It seems clear to us of course but not to them; Tiffany assumes hell just be another entry on her long list of recent sexual partners while Pat clings like a drowning man to the idea that his marriage to the invisible Nikki - which ended in an act of disturbing violence as we eventually learn - can still be redeemed. During Tiffany and Pats disastrous first date (which Pat insists isnt a date because hes getting back together with Nikki any day now) they eat Raisin Bran at a diner while she regales him with steamy tales about sleeping with all her co-workers (male and female) at her last job. Pat isnt literally wearing his garbage bag in that scene but he might as well be. All the crockery ends up on the floor along with the remnants of Raisin Bran and were left with the realization that these two people are falling in love but may be too screwed-up to deal with it - a phenomenon that afflicts many of us at one time or another from you and me to David Petraeus and that lady with the upper arms.Theres no point denying that ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is shameless cornpone given that the bumpy course of Pat and Tiffanys romance includes such elements as a ballroom dancing competition a crucial showdown between the Eagles and the Dallas Cowboys and a parlay bet orchestrated by Pat Sr. that links the two. Not to mention a deceptive epistolary exchange straight out of classic French theater. But where most American romantic comedies are either made by talentless hacks or by Hollywood pros who can barely conceal their contempt for the material and the audience this one was made by a leading American director at the height of his powers whos paying attention to every emotional beat every cut and every frame. Great cinema? Hell I dont know. But one of the most satisfying movies of the holiday season that much is for sure.""Silver Linings Playbook"" opens this week in major cities with nationwide release to begin Nov. 21.

In the wacky exhilarating ""Silver Linings Playbook"" the border is as thin as onion skin if it exists at all. After eight months in a psychiatric hospital Philadelphia high school teacher Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is back with his blue-collar parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver). Hes all set to start over and win back his ex-wife. Sure hes had a couple of rough patches. There was the time he beat the daylights out of her lover. And yeah he goes furniture-tossing berserk whenever he hears ""Ma Cherie Amour"" their wedding song. And theres the restraining order. But Pats got a plan to turn his life around with a Great Books reading list plenty of exercise and a positive attitude. What could possibly go wrong? When Pat throws ""A Farewell to Arms"" through a closed window because he cant handle its tragic ending you realize the answer Everything. A truly decent guy except for the violent unstable part Pat white-knuckles his way through every social interaction. When his friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) and his wife Veronica (Julia Stiles) have Pat over for dinner they also invite Veronicas sister Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a new widow. A bit kooky and a bit kinky -- she worked through her grief by sleeping with every single person in her office -- Tiffany is the only person able to stay a step ahead of Pats manic behavior. The rocks in her head fit the holes in his. Tiffany promises to help Pat mend things with his wife in exchange for one little favor. With a resume including ""Spanking the Monkey"" ""Flirting With Disaster"" ""The Fighter"" and now ""Silver Linings Playbook"" director David O. Russell is becoming to freaky family dysfunction what Scorsese is to the Mafia. He loves awkward unmanageable people adores the energy of a good fight thrills to rat-a-tat dialogue with the camera swinging from face to face. He brings out the best in his cast by making them dive to the bottom of conflicted multi-dimensional characters. SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK  out of 4 stars Rating R for language and some sexual content/nudity. Cooper is inspired leagues beyond the labored comic shtick of the ""Hangover"" movies and plays his rapturous self-delusion cannily. Positive-thinking Pat is ready to follow his strained optimism right off a cliff. Lawrence shows a new audacity. She moves like a whirlwind as Tiffany spitting sass and sarcasm at anyone who thwarts her. She overpowers or ignores people -- she cannot deal with them. But is she the firm hand Pat needs or the trigger for his next blowup? As Pat Sr. a superstitious obsessive-compulsive sports bookmaker De Niro does his best comic acting in ages. Weaver so chilling in the Australian crime saga ""Animal Kingdom"" is sweetly daffy and surprisingly duplicitous as the woman of the madhouse. Russell succeeds by refusing to simplify his characters or his ideas. Although ""Silver Linings"" is a romantic comedy its an anarchic example of the form. A petty father-son squabble turns into a terrifying physical brawl. A big dance number bristles with intricate clowning and builds to a 10-kiloton sight gag. The cheerful ending is not so pat as it seems when you reflect on the amount of manipulation and lying it took to achieve it. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" tells us that happily-ever-after may depend on finding people who coexist with our lunacy not ones who can lead us out of it. In any case its crazy good.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post     Romantic comedy. Rated R. 120 minutes. At area theaters. The trailer for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" made the new romantic comedy look too perfect. Not exactly perfect you know but intentionally quirkily lovably imperfect. It seemed to have all the trendy carefully chosen ingredients for a heart-on-its-sleeve rom-com hit -- a strong attractive cast sharp dialogue keen music pairings laugh-out-loud back-and-forths weighty backstory and a beloved director. Surely this is too good to be true? Actually no. All the silvery buzz here is deserved folks. This meaningful film keeps the laughs giddy anxiousness and warm butterflies from the trailer and sustains it all through two full hours of a love story. Cheers to director David O. Russell who also wrote the screenplay based on Matthew Quicks novel. This movie is funny -- and sad. But its more up than down which is saying something given the subject matter. After a stint in a mental hospital former teacher Pat (Bradley Cooper) comes home to reintegrate with his family his friends his marriage. Some people have moved on -- including his wife whose affair with another teacher brought on Pats mental snap. But some are still waiting for Pat including mom (Jacki Weaver) dad (Robert De Niro) and pal Ronnie (John Ortiz). Pat might be better but hes not well. Upon arriving home he starts devouring books on his ex-wifes syllabus. He finishes Ernest Hemingways ""A Farewell to Arms"" in his bedroom one night at 4 a.m. asks ""What the f--?"" chucks the book through a glass window and marches to his sleeping parents room to rant on the unfairness of it all. When they coddle his anger and ask for an apology Pat cant fully commit. ""I cant apologize"" he says. ""You know what I will do? Apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway because thats whos to blame here."" Its a smart scene that shows the humor and compassion that run through the entire film. When Ronnie introduces Pat to his troubled sister-in-law Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) theres a connection -- but Pat does his best to quash the chemistry. Hes nice to her as he tells her hes not hitting on her. He tells her his sad story mentioning the word ""wife"" more than once. And he keeps reminding Tiffany of her own sadness that her ex-husband is dead and shes not fully over it. Pats titular search for a break from his lifes weight -- ""If you stay positive you have a shot at a silver lining"" he says often -- doesnt make this film. But his heart and personality do. Pat is a likable character and Cooper handles his idiosyncracies with charm and ease. But this is almost Lawrences film as her Tiffany tames Pats mania while also keeping tabs on her own demons. It helps that theyre surrounded by truly gifted actors including De Niro as a father with (OCD) issues of his own and Pats buddies Ronnie (Ortiz) and Danny (Chris Tucker) who give some of the best laughs of the movie.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 16 2012 Save for later Saved About video ads About video ads View Caption of The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide Bradley Coopers Pat in writer-director David O. Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a bipolar cuckolded former schoolteacher in suburban Philadelphia who has recently emerged from eight months in a mental institution. He was put there after beating up the beau of the wife he believes still loves him and wants to win back (despite her restraining order). Living with his uneasily protective parents (well played by Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) the hyperjumpy Pat tries to pound himself into shape in order to rescue a marriage he is too delusional to see is over.Fortunately both for Pat and for the movie Jennifer Lawrences tough-talking neighbor Tiffany a recent widow with her own share of mental baggage is on hand to salvage the situation. She dragoons Pat into rehearsing as her partner for an upcoming local dance competition. We can see what he cant Tiffany and not his wife is his true soul mate.Russell directs the movie almost as if Pat were behind the camera; the visual rhythms are manic and short-fused. In every other way this neo-""David and Lisa"" sugarcoats the sufferings of these people in order to boost a sentimental wrap-up thats right out of ""Dancing With the Stars."" Its slick stuff but Lawrence in her most high-low sad-comic turn yet is remarkable. Grade B (Rated R for language and some sexual content/nudity.)

Look we never find out the actual ages of the characters. Just because we know the ages of the actors means very little. Cooper actually looks younger than 37. And Pattinson would have ruined this movie. Cooper gives a great performance here. And the chemistry between the two actors is unquestionable. Here is the thing. Age means very little in my book. I know a couple that had 25 years separating them and they were married for over 30 years before he passed away recently. Stay open to everyone and you dont limit your chances at finding someone you connect with. joesaid on Wednesday January 23 2013 74758 AM37 and 22 is not creepy... Especially since each of these actors could realistically be playing characters with a five year offset meaning the characters may be 32 and 27.

By Rex Reed  11/19/12 625pm Lawrence left and Cooper right in Silver Linings Playbook. A lot of critics have lost their proverbial cool over Silver Linings Playbook a rom-com about mental illness ballroom dancing and the Philadelphia Eagles. I wish I knew why. Its a slow repetitive meandering mostly overacted little picture--perfectly agreeable but nothing special and directed with a steamroller by David O. Russell. Go figure. I have never been able to tolerate the pointless meat-headed masturbatory cinema of self-indulgent writer-director Mr. Russell especially the moronic Spanking the Monkey (1994) the criminally boring Three Kings (1999) and the profoundly pretentious I Heart Huckabees which poisoned the ozone in 2004. Six years passed and I was shaken to my shoelaces by The Fighter (2010) the most powerful study of a down-and-out boxer since Rod Serlings classic Requiem for a Heavyweight. The ridiculously titled Silver Linings Playbook not in the same league as The Fighter doesnt do for Bradley Cooper what that movie did for Mark Wahlberg but it does suggest that the eccentric Mr. Russell has learned a few things about where to place a camera and how to stage small scenes that add up to a satisfying whole. For starters theres Bradley Cooper whos built a solid following by devoting his entire career to trashy comedies proving again that you cant go broke reducing the IQs of the most undemanding segment of the public. So we got assorted loathsome Hangover Xeroxes and Mr. Cooper got a People magazine cover. But unless you were one of the lucky theatergoers who caught his resplendent performance last summer in the sold-out production of The Elephant Man at the Williamstown Theatre Festival then you have no idea what a prodigious talent he is. He will probably continue full-throttle turning out junk giving his fans what they want but I suspect that deep down inside where his pride is he wants to prove he can act. The movie is a mess but there is some evidence that Mr. Russell kicked and nudged and tweaked his star into doing something besides resting on his George Clooney charm and Pepsodent smile. He actually does some acting. He plays Pat a bipolar substitute high-school history teacher and former athlete who returns home to Philadelphia after an eight-month meltdown in a mental hospital. Subject to irrational mood swings and violent rages he went ballistic when his wife cheated with another faculty member. Pat beat up the guy and lost his job his marriage his house and his freedom and he was sent away on a plea bargain. Now hes back in town in the custody of his dysfunctional parents and determined to get back in shape rebuild his life and win his wife back. His father (Robert De Niro) who is as crazy as he is just wants Pat to return to what matters most in life--the religion of worshipping the Philadelphia Eagles. Meanwhile Pat runs works out wears garbage bags to sweat dispenses fun facts about American history while breaking his wifes restraining order and wakes his parents in the middle of the night ranting about Ernest Hemingway. Between tirades he meets an emotionally disturbed widow named Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who has been fired from her job after having sex with 11 people in her office. Tiffany can compare prescription antidepressants with Pat faster than you can win Bingo at a Friday night rehab social. Pat is on his way back down the mouse-hole and who can blame him? His best friend from the hospital (Chris Tucker) is a perennial escapee who is forever inventing legal technicalities that never quite hold up when men in white shoes ring the doorbell carrying straitjackets. Tiffany who turned goth slut after her policeman husband was killed playing Good Samaritan on his way home from buying lingerie at Victorias Secret offers to reunite Pat with his wife if he will partner with her in a dance competition. During long rehearsals in the garage to songs by Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash a mutual attraction blossoms thwarted by awkward idiosyncrasies that keep the movie moving from one absurdity to another. The football part of the movie--about how Pats crazy father family members and friends bet their life savings and future on an Eagles game in a parlay that depends on at least a 5-point score in the dance competition--is so confusing I never did figure it out and couldnt care less. (Seems the father who has been banned from the Eagles stadium for repeatedly starting riots has invested everything in his beloved team in the hope of financing a cheesesteak business.) None of this makes sense which is about par for a David O. Russell movie. It all ends in what would ordinarily seem anticlimactic except for one thing how can anything be anticlimactic if there isnt much of a movie to precede it? Mr. De Niro hasnt bothered to give a real performance for at least the past 10 years and he shows no signs of breaking precedent here. Theres nothing wrong with the overrated Jennifer Lawrence that some serious acting lessons couldnt improve. The rest of the actors are pretty much on their own. Nothing mature or thoughtful here which leaves Mr. Cooper to carry the show alone. Hes played it comfortable and hes played it safe. Showing its fun to be bipolar he could have played it like Jerry Lewis. Instead hes starting to realize the rewards of taking acting to a deeper level. rreedobserver.com SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK Running Time 120 minutes Written by David O.

Russell. Cast Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro. Rating R for language and some sexual content/nudity. RELATED NEWS Interview Author Matthew Quick Qamp;A Jennifer Lawrence talks fame Silving Linings By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Tue Nov 20 2012 427 PM For a movie that seems at times to have no idea what its trying to do ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is compulsively watchable. There are a couple of reasons. One is that director David O. Russell working from Matthew Quicks novel actually knows what hes doing with his movie about a mentally ill man trying to regain his foothold on life and win back his ex-wife at the same time. Russell is willing to let the wheels almost fall off from time to time to keep things interesting confident that he can pull everything back together. Another is the acting. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have been good in other films before but not this good. Their performances carry the film each giving depth to their characters that continually surprises. Cooper typically plays a handsome charmer. Here he shows real pain. Lawrence received an Oscar nomination for her work in ""Winters Bone"" as a young backwoods woman struggling to keep her family together and fame for starring in ""The Hunger Games."" Here she plays a wounded woman also trying to regain her balance in life. When we meet Pat (Cooper) he is being released from a psychiatric hospital into the care of his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver). (Danny a friend he met at the hospital played by Chris Tucker goes along for the ride.) When they get home Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) is surprised. Dont worry Dolores says. But the look in Pats eyes as if he is physically struggling to contain his mania (and in fact is) tells a different story. Pat was committed to the hospital after he caught his wife in the shower with another man and beat him almost to death. But now hes lost weight hes on medication and with an optimistic outlook hes going to win her back Yes Really To everyone else the restraining order shes taken out against him makes this seem unlikely. At dinner with friends Pat meets Tiffany (Lawrence). She is dealing with her own issues but after an awkward encounter agrees to pass a letter to his ex-wife in return for his entering a dance contest with her. So here we have elements of a mental-health drama a romantic comedy and a competition. Throw in an obsessive love for the Philadelphia Eagles and Pat Sr. obsessively betting on them and youve got quite the offbeat stew. And somehow it all comes together. Parts of the film are laugh-out-loud funny others heartbreaking. The ache in Coopers eyes goes beyond merely pining for his wife and what she represents to him. He is desperate to be back in control of his life. Lawrence similarly commands her characters emotions to the extent that she has any control. Theyre a volatile mix; in movies thats the best kind. De Niro and Weaver are outstanding. Pat Sr. longs to connect with his son but doesnt know how while Dolores tries a little too hard to set things right. Poignancy swirls through the whole movie. Throwing together so many movie tropes and blending them is both a brilliant idea and a scary one but one that Russell proves well capable of handling.

Then theres another cure strength in numbers be they small (one true love) or large (a surrogate family to augment the one we happen to be stuck with). Its a truly elating movie.""Im not the explosion guy"" insists Pat (Bradley Cooper) but evidence suggests otherwise. He caught his wife cheating and beat the other guy senseless; after a bipolar diagnosis and eight months in a mental institution hes determined to make amends with his spouse. Then he meets Tiffany (a volcanic Jennifer Lawrence) another damaged and attractive soul who does what screwball comedy heroines have been doing since the 1930s She throws the guy for a loop.I can pinpoint exactly when I fell in love with Silver Linings Playbook. Pat has met Tiffany at an awkward dinner and he doesnt know what to do with the ensuing sparks. He goes home to his parents in suburban Philadelphia stares at the gold ring on his finger and violently rummages through the house for his wedding videos as Led Zeppelins ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" plays on the soundtrack. The sequence and song sustain a feverish tone as the situation grows violent and all three actors -- Cooper Jacki Weaver and a recharged Robert De Niro -- enact a brutal and then brutally funny domestic kitchen-sink opera.Were in the sure hands of director David O. Russell who has made his best movie since 1999s Three Kings. Fans of Russells The Fighter will recognize some similar traits including a dysfunctional Northeastern tribe fueled by resentment and hope and an unashamed embrace of melodramatic confrontation. But the Silver Linings tightrope walk is bracing and unique. Everything is in your face but the emotional chaos is conveyed with fine emotional precision.Russells kinetic approach matches the characters inner turmoil as the camera pushes in and pulls out to reflect emotional ups and downs. The soundtrack shows a Scorsese-like pop music instinct (a compliment that should never be tossed around lightly) through songs obscure and well known.The cast is strong from top to bottom and you cant help but give some credit to Russell who guided Christian Bale and Melissa Leo to Oscars for The Fighter. Two performers stand out here. Lawrence owns the screen from the moment she enters and shows indefatigable range from deadened silence to hope to rage. The old pro De Niro seems more engaged than he has in years as an angry obsessive-compulsive Philadelphia Eagles fanatic who desperately wants to connect to his mixed-up son. Coopers Pat wearing a DeSean Jackson jersey as a sort of armor against the world ably fills the tumultuous center.Football fandom is a key element here; theres a hilarious bit in which Pats dad throws down with a gambling buddy over the Cowboys ""Americas Team"" designation. (Dad cant go to the games anymore. Too many fistfights.)The Philly faithful are one more manifestation of family and community. They can be knuckleheads. They can be a little crazy. But in the end they need one another. The Silver Linings crew is like the family gathering that erupts in rage but ends with everyone loving one another all the more. The feeling is as infectious as the movies cockeyed optimism.Follow Chris Vognar on Twitter at chrisvognar.Silver Linings Playbook(A) Directed by David O. Russell.

Silver Linings Playbook Teamwork pays off in Silver Linings Playbook By Joe Williams joewilliamspost-dispatch.com314-340-8344 Joe Williams Nov 20 2012 (...) Weinstein Company Bradley Cooper stars as Pat Solitano and Jennifer Lawrence is Tiffany in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Weinstein Company Jennifer Lawrence stars as Tiffany and Bradley Cooper stars as Pat Solitano in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Weinstein Company Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" When films are good actors and directors get a lot of the credit that should go to the screenwriters. In the case of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" which is one of the best films of the year there is a popcorn bowl of glory to go around. Matthew Quick celebrates the successful adaptation of his novel. Bradley Cooper proves that hes more than a pretty face. Jennifer Lawrence exercises the acting muscles that made her an award finalist for ""Winters Bone."" And David O. Russell exults in the career comeback that started with ""The Fighter.""After the box-office failure of the absurdist comedy ""I Heart Huckabees"" Russell was a journeyman director with a checkered reputation because of some bipolar episodes on the set. Then producer/star Mark Wahlberg took a chance on Russell for ""The Fighter"" albeit after a couple other directors dropped out. Their movie was subsequently nominated for several Oscars and won the two awards in the supporting categories. So Wahlberg figured he had first dibs on Russells next project a terrific script about sports fandom and personal redemption called ""Silver Linings Playbook."" But Russell and his investors opted instead for the more economical Cooper.Their low-ball gambit paid off. Although its easy to imagine Wahlberg in the role of a football fan with a temper problem Cooper is a revelation. As recently furloughed mental patient Pat Solitano Coopers usual grin is replaced by the grimace of a manic depressive. Back home in Philadelphia the former schoolteacher tells his wary parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver both excellent) that hes never felt better and hes ready to woo back his estranged wife Nikki whose cheating enraged him. Scared that he might hurt Nikki or himself friends introduce Pat to another troubled spirit Tiffany (Lawrence). She is recently widowed and dogged by a bad reputation so she feels she can confide in Pat. But hes scared and even contemptuous of her vulnerability. Her fiery reaction to his cold shoulder makes for a potent chemistry.Tiffany agrees to broker a meeting between Pat and Nikki who has a restraining order against him if Pat will agree to compete in Tiffanys ballroom dance competition. The reluctant rehearsal scenes produce some raucous comedy as do the scenes where Pats father tries to reconnect with him through their mutual love of Philadelphia Eagles football. But theres always an undercurrent of volatility in the torrent of acidic dialogue. Sometimes when the anger erupts to the surface ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is reminiscent of psychodramas such as Mike Nichols adaptation of ""Whos Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" but mostly its modeled on the gentler eccentricities of Nichols ""The Graduate"" and kindred 60s and 70s flicks such as ""Harold and Maude."" And whereas most modern dramedies traffic in ambiguity here the emotional payoff is pure joy. Going deep without resorting to trick plays the sure-handed ""Silver Linings Playbook"" scores on every possession.

Photo Credit Jojo Whilden advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A bipolar man hoping to win back his wife meets a young woman with problems of her own. BOTTOM LINE Cooper and Lawrence make a wonderfully prickly pair in this skewed charmer from David O. Russell (""The Fighter""). Its messy silly embarrassingly romantic and impossible to resist. CAST Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Chris Tucker LENGTH 202 Some movies are so likable so naturally charming that youll forgive any dopey idea they throw at you. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is one of them. Its the story of a mentally imbalanced couple who must win a dance contest to help start a restaurant -- see what I mean? -- but the movie has such a loosey-goosey energy and so many winning performances that youll walk out feeling all warm and fuzzy. Directed and written by David O. Russell (""The Fighter"") from Matthew Quicks novel ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is the kind of heart-on-sleeve romance that Cameron Crowe once did so well though its characters have darker edges. Bradley Cooper plays Pat Solatano a bipolar man hoping to win back his ex-wife despite a pesky restraining order; Jennifer Lawrence is Tiffany a young widow whos been drowning her sorrows in casual sex. Introduced by Tiffanys icy sister (Julia Stiles) the two black sheep compare medications trade insults (""You have social problems"" Pat observes) and instantly form a weird connection. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Lawrence is fierce and funny as Tiffany a woman whose emotional wounds have scabbed over with anger; Cooper in what feels like his acting debut (not counting those ""Hangover"" cakewalks) is appealing as a well-meaning wreck. Together they create a wonderfully discombobulated chemistry that crackles even when the script turns sappy. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" can feel overcrowded but its hard to complain about a cast that includes Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver (""Animal Kingdom"") as Pats flawed parents John Ortiz as a miserable suburbanite and Chris Tucker as an upbeat nut case. Somehow this movies flaws also are its assets which may be exactly why it ends up such a winner. 238 VideoTrailer Silver Linings Playbook PLOT A bipolar man hoping to win back his wife meets a young woman with problems of her own. advertisement | advertise on newsday CAST Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Chris Tucker LENGTH 202 BOTTOM LINE Cooper and Lawrence make a wonderfully prickly pair in this skewed charmer from David O.

"Silver Linings Playbook review A good kind of mood swing | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSilver Linings Playbook review A good kind of mood swingIn Silver Linings Playbook Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence find attraction amidst distractions. It may just be the years best comedy.Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper make a winning pair in the heartfelt comedy Silver Linings Playbook.  (Alliance Films)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticTues. Nov. 20 2012Silver Linings Playbook (out of 4)Starring Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Jackie Weaver and Chris Tucker. Written and directed by David O. Russell. 120 minutes. Opens Nov. 21 at major theatres. 14AStop that snickering Theres nothing really wrong with Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper). In Silver Linings Playbook a very funny movie about being a little crazy Pat isnt just looking on the bright side. Hes a regular ray o sunshine as long as you dont rile him. Article Continued BelowHes taken up running and lost a pile of weight. Hes working on winning back his wife who left Pat and now has a restraining order against him.""Im remaking myself"" he tells everybody. Who would doubt him? Just because he nearly killed the man he caught naked with his spouse. Just because he trashes his shrinks office after hearing his wedding tune ""My Cheri Amour"" in the waiting room.People leap to conclusions about Pat. So what if he spent eight months in a Baltimore psychiatric institute where he learned hes ""undiagnosed bipolar with mood swings?"" Cant everybody see hes OK now?""Im not the explosion guy. My father is the explosion guy.""Yes Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) does have his mood swings too. Especially when his beloved Philadelphia Eagles fail on the gridiron which happens too often. Good thing his devoted wife (Jackie Weaver) keeps him supplied with a constant supply of beer and homemade Italian snacks.And whats with this strange girl Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence)? Why does she keep following Pat around his Philly neighbourhood? A recent widow -- her police officer husband died -- shes been bingeing on one-night stands. Maybe shes the one whos nuts although she doesnt think so either.""I was a big slut"" she says ""but Im not any more.""Writer/director David O. Russell has his work cut out for him making sense of this crew let alone winning our sympathies. You think his characters are bipolar? Russells screenplay adapted from Matthew Quicks 2008 novel veers from brow-furrowing drama to screwball comedy sometimes within the same scene. A story about serious mental health and family challenges slowly but surely becomes a grinner about a dance contest the outcome of which you end up actually caring about.You dont begrudge or judge these mood swings not like you might have with I Heart Huckabees the last film Russell wrote as well as directed. That one was zany just for the sake of zaniness.Silver Linings Playbook actually does have a heart. It doesnt mock mental illness; it questions our rigid definitions of ""normal"" and ""sane."" Russell learned something about people making The Fighter an Oscar-nominated picture about overcoming personal issues that also included some boxing.This new one also Academy bound has a cast shooting sparks. Cooper has never been funnier or more vulnerable. Lawrence demonstrates her comic chops having already proven her dramatic skills in A Winters Bone and The Hunger Games. A scene where she deflates De Niros pomposity is worthy of Kate Hepburn. She and Cooper make a great couple sassy and sexy.And what lightning bolt struck De Niro? Hes actually been on a roll lately including a solid previous teaming with Cooper for Limitless that suggests hes tired of phoning it in -- or maybe just of people accusing him of phoning it in. He digs into this funny and rich role of a dad who loves too much especially if it has anything to do with the Philadelphia Eagles.Weaver is grand too and so are supporting players that include Chris Tucker (where you been man?) Anupam Kher John Ortiz and Julia Stiles as the enablers and disablers who cross paths with our silver linings searchers.Silver Linings Playbook isnt perfect -- the ending is untidy -- but it may just be the years best comedy. People who attended TIFF already know this because they gave it the fests audience award.You must see it. Otherwise people will think youre crazy.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

By David Denby Lifeboat Suraj Sharma and the tiger in Ang Lees movie.   Credit Illustration by Victo Ngai The four-hundred-and-fifty-pound Bengal tiger that appears in Ang Lees ""Life of Pi"" is of course a digital beast. You cannot train a tiger to act although the great Stella Adler did a good job with Marlon Brando. In ""Pi"" the re-created cat is fast beautiful and hungry. Fearful symmetry indeed. Hes palpable enough--snarling and frightening except when hes half-dying of thirst. The centerpiece of Lees adaptation of Yann Martels prize-winning 2001 novel is a long confrontation on a lifeboat between the tiger and a teen-age Indian boy named Pi (Suraj Sharma) which turns into a wary cohabitation. The story is improbable (were meant to see it as a fable even as we watch it) but Lee has filmed it with so much moment-by-moment physical detail and so bounteous a celebration of the natural world that ""Life of Pi"" becomes one of the great adventure films. You cant fight the kind of overwhelming sensuous feast that is possible only in the cinema; you just let it sweep you away as the yawning chasms and purple-and-green forests of ""Avatar"" did. It takes a while however for ""Life of Pi"" to reach that level of enchantment. Lee is a generous intelligent and patient director and he has made some wonderful movies including ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" But I wondered during the longueurs of his previous two films--""Lust Caution"" and ""Taking Woodstock""--if his narrative sense wasnt failing. ""Taking Woodstock"" just felt slight but the red-and-ebony Shanghai spy movie ""Lust Caution"" was a lamentable case a great idea but filled with pointless elaboration and unnecessary sequences. In ""Pi"" Lee is if anything too patient too faithful to his source. He holds to Martels metafictional frame. In Montreal a young uninspired novelist (Rafe Spall) begins a conversation with the now middle-aged Pi (Irrfan Khan) an emigre who teaches religion and says that he once had an astounding adventure. The professor talks the novelist listens and the movie slowly gets going. We see Pis boyhood in the city of Pondicherry on the Bay of Bengal which was formerly a French colony. Pi was a bold youth and an experimenter who was almost promiscuous in his religious appetites--he was born a Hindu but took up Christianity and then Islam. His tough father--the essence of this-world realism--disapproved of his sons curiosity. His mother fed his imagination his love of stories and beauty. This part of the movie is sweet-tempered but overly methodical even ponderous a product of Lees determination to pay utmost respect to a culture different from the ones he knows in Taiwan and America. (Lee wants to honor Martels tone as well as his narrative strategy but perhaps filmmakers should stop using India as a source of higher spirituality--its a genteel form of exploitation and one thats increasingly misleading. Where is the surging high-tech entrepreneurial nation of the past twenty years?) Pis family owns a zoo and decides to move with some of the animals to Canada and at last the movie proper arrives. On the journey across the Pacific the old Japanese freighter carrying them is wrecked in a storm. The animals washed out of the hold flail around in the tumultuous seas. Pi falls into a lifeboat where he is joined by a wounded zebra an orangutan a hyena and popping out from beneath a canvas covering a tiger who owing to a clerical error is called Richard Parker. ""Welcome to Pis Ark"" the boy exclaims but the group is less a peaceable kingdom sailing toward rebirth than a bunch of irregulars locked in a remorseless struggle for survival. Soon enough Pi and Richard Parker are the only passengers left on board. As the animal sleeps Pi makes a small raft which he attaches to the boat by a rope. He sometimes camps out on the raft which is dangerous but less dangerous than a tigers jaws. The movie becomes a survivalist mini-epic in the spirit of ""Robinson Crusoe."" Desperate ingenuity and sheer reflex lead to one memorable scene after another such as when a stowaway rat crawls into Pis hair and he flings it at Richard Parker who catches it with his teeth and swallows it in one gulp. This central part of the movie is perfectly paced; Lee alternates periods of sleep and calculation with frantic activity including another big storm and Pis improvised attempts to stave off Richard Parker with whatever he has at hand--a spar a knife a nervous spray of urine to mark his turf. Throughout the ocean scenes have a glowing magical look. We accept that Lee has gone past strict realism that hes heightened the beauty and the strangeness of the South Pacific. The boat is bombarded by hundreds of flying fish and surrounded by bioluminescent creatures that undulate in the water at night like candles in a procession. Suraj Sharma--a Delhi schoolboy who has never acted before--has a handsome face large expressive eyes and an easy way with the camera; hes intensely sympathetic. He decides that he must learn to live with Richard Parker so he trains the beast with lumps of fish and a whistle that he finds in the boat. By keeping the tiger alive he will concentrate enough to keep himself alive. The movies great triumph is that Lee and his technicians never anthropomorphize the animal. This is no sentimental boy-meets-big-cat story. Richard Parker is a member of a different species; hes not interested in affectionate ties with a skinny teen-ager who has kept him from dying. Thats a genuine and bracing insight. But I could have done without the boys search for God and other mighty significances. Secularist audiences in general have trouble with ""quest"" movies and literature (Hermann Hesse Paulo Coelho) in which a single meaning is somehow to be sought and wrested from the teeming universe. There are many searches many meanings most of them partial. As Wallace Shawn said thirty years ago in ""My Dinner with Andre"" something no more miraculous than a cup of coffee is enough transcendence for one day. ""Life of Pi"" at its best celebrates the idiosyncratic wonders and dangers of raw ravaging nature and Lee wrings more than enough meaning from the excitement of that spectacle; we need nothing higher. David O. Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is pretty much a miscalculation from beginning to end. Russells hero is a young history teacher Pat (Bradley Cooper) who is released from a Baltimore hospital after eight months of treatment for bipolar disorder. At home with his parents in Philadelphia he talks non-stop about his wife who has left him. In the middle of the night he breaks a window by throwing a copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"" through it then wakes up Mom and Dad to complain about the books plot. Im not quarrelling with his literary judgment (he might have disposed of ""The Old Man and the Sea"" too) but the trouble is that Pat isnt much more than a manic self-absorbed chatterbox. Whats supposed to be clinically wrong with him as a man is inseparable from what is merely infantile in him as a character. Were not much interested in Pat--he doesnt have an idea in his head just a lot of words--and Bradley Cooper goes at the part with burning eyes and great speeding rants. Russell doubles down on the noise by making Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) an obsessive too. Hes a furiously superstitious sports nut who makes wild bets on games and is always in a foul temper. As Pats mother (Jacki Weaver) tries to keep the peace every family scene turns into a fight. Russell made a good satirical comedy--""Flirting with Disaster"" (1996)--in which the babble of self-conscious people was buoyantly funny. But ""Playbook"" just feels worked up--an exercise in which actors can blow off steam. The crowded family living room resembles a coop with outraged chickens pecking for an advantage. Russell adds to Pats complications with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a young widow from the neighborhood. Tiffany is demanding needy and abrupt but also smart and she throws Pat off his monomaniacal rhythm. She chases after him hugs him then hauls off and smacks him across the face. Tiffany may be a little strange though we dont believe her for a second when she says that in her grief she ""had sex with everyone in my office."" Lawrence is tough and proud and always plays strong and the remark doesnt track with anything we see onscreen. ""Playbook"" turns into a stuttering romantic comedy of sorts. Pat keeps talking in his head to his wife (who is barely in the movie) and we irritably wait for him to notice that the woman whos attracted to him with her smoky voice sapling body and fierce directness is worth the trouble to any man sane or otherwise.

Silver Linings Playbook Silver Linings Playbook Credit The Weinstein Company By Peter Travers November 15 2012 More News All Stories >> Damaged goods thats Tiffany and Pat. Hes a bipolar teacher just out of eight months in a state loony bin. Shes a young widow overcompensating for the death of her cop husband by fucking well anyone. Theyre manic energy unleashed. But as played with go-for-broke intensity humor and raw feeling by Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper theyre deranged romantics you cant help rooting for. More News All Stories >> Playing the Hollywood cute game has no appeal for director David O. Russell who adapts Matthew Quicks 2008 novel with the inspired lunacy and acid wit it demands. Google Russell and you get tales of onset shoutfests with the starry likes of George Clooney and Lily Tomlin (that ones a YouTube favorite). Is Russell that mercurial? Dont care. What matters is his enviable record of smart scrappy movies - Spanking the Monkey Flirting With Disaster Three Kings I Heart Huckabees The Fighter. Silver Linings Playbook is eager to sting instead of soothe. Its one of the years best movies because Russell makes you laugh till it hurts. Trouble starts when Pats peacemaker mom Dolores (Jacki Weaver wonderful as the films sole contact with sanity) picks him up at the clinic. Then Pat is imprisoned back in his family home ruled by Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) a sports bookie so obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles that its his only means of communication. De Niro getting a rare chance to grapple with a role worthy of his talents is sensational. Dads been barred from Eagles games because of violent outbursts. And his son has been jailed for going postal on the guy he caught with his wife in the shower. Pain is the subtext of nearly every interaction in this film. For the old man it comes from the toll his obsessive-compulsive disorder takes on his family. For the son its delusion. Pat is always looking for a silver lining despite the fact that his ex-wife Nikki (Brea Bee) has a restraining order against him. Hearing their wedding song ""My Cherie Amour"" really sets Pat off. And yet he thinks a reconciliation is in the cards. No one else does especially not his therapist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher) and fellow patient Danny (Chris Tucker nice to have you back) who visits every time he busts out of the cuckoos nest. To distract Pat from his impossible dream his best friend Ronnie (John Ortiz) invites Pat home to dinner to set him up with Tiffany (Lawrence) the sister of his controlling wife Veronica (Julia Stiles). The dinner is a disaster. But Pat and Tiffany speaking their unfiltered minds in a flood of uncensored dialogue hit it off. Sort of. Tiffany offers him sex. Pat still faithful to his faithless ex-wife offers Tiffany a deal. If shell deliver a letter to Nikki hell be her partner in a dance contest. Tacky yes also terrific. Cooper best known as the Hangover guy and Peoples Sexiest Man Alive seizes the juiciest role of his career and meets every comic and dramatic challenge. Theres an ache in his funny touching and vital performance that resonates. Lawrence the fem warrior of The Hunger Games and Academy Award nominee at 20 for 2010s Winters Bone is some kind of miracle. Shes rude dirty funny foulmouthed sloppy sexy vibrant and vulnerable sometimes all in the same scene even in the same breath. No list of Best Actress Oscar contenders would be complete without the electrifying Lawrence in the lead. She lights up the screen. Russell gives Silver Linings Playbook a jagged jolting spark that throws you off balance. Tiffany jogs up behind Pat prodding and poking until she wins him over. The movie works the same way. It doesnt cheat until a ""happy"" ending that panders when it should feel provisional. Only in Hollywood can mental illness be cured by moonstruck fantasy. Pat and Tiffany walk and often wobble among the emotionally wounded. Thats when these two losers in love cut deepest. Tinged with shadows and ignited by Lawrence and Cooper Silver Linings Playbook raises the bar on romantic comedy. Its crazy good.

Russells exceptional new film showcases the emerging talents of Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. The Weinstein Company There was a moment as the 20th century prepared to give way to the 21st when it appeared American film might be on the cusp of a breakthrough era with a handful of young (or at least young-ish) directors coming into their own at once. Wes Anderson had just given us Rushmore; M. Night Shyamalan The Sixth Sense; Paul Thomas Anderson Magnolia; and David O. Russell the eldest of the bunch at 41 Three Kings. All seemed to harbor the potential for greatness. In the years since each one has taken his detours but with the exception of Shyamalan--whose steep and as yet unbroken descent has been more unnerving than any of his films--all look to be back on track. In the case of Russell his post-2000 wanderings carried him from the overkill idiosyncrasy of ""I [Heart] Huckabees"" to the relatively conventional satisfactions of The Fighter. With his latest film Silver Linings Playbook he has again recalibrated and achieved the quirky yet poignant balance of his best early work. Related Story Review The Subtle Eloquence of Lincoln Thirtysomething Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is returning home to live with his parents in Philadelphia following an eight-month stint in a mental institution for being ""undiagnosed bipolar with mood swings and weird thinking brought on by stress."" This belated diagnosis was reached following his less-than-collegial response to finding his wife--like him a school teacher--taking a shower with one of their colleagues. During his time away therapy and medication have transmuted his rage into a kind obsessively oversold optimism. ""Look at my eyes"" he reassures his parents. ""See how clear they are"" Though hes lost his job his marriage and his home hes convinced that their restoration is right around the corner. ""This is what I learned at the hospital"" he explains ecstatically. ""If you stay positive you have a shot at a silver lining.""Pat spends his days exercising fervently--he jogs suburban streets wearing a trash bag to ""help with the sweat""--watching Eagles games with his bookmaking OCD father (Robert De Niro) and working his way through his estranged wifes class reading list in preparation for an anticipated reconciliation. (This last activity proves less than therapeutic when he takes the pitiless conclusion of A Farewell to Arms rather too much to heart at four oclock in the morning.)Over dinner at a friends house he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a fellow veteran of psychiatric intervention who has also returned to the refuge of the parental nest. (Pat gets an attic; Tiffany a finished garage.) She quickly proves the yin to his yang her outlook as dark as his is phosphorescent. The two begin circling warily alternatingly bonding over their shared pharmaceutical experience and bickering about which one of them is ""crazier."" As Pat protests ""Its just not right lumping you and I together"" But lumped together they are whether intersecting one anothers jogging routes with stalker-like obstinacy or sharing a dinner of raisin bran and tea. It is during the latter that Tiffany reveals that after her cop husband died she lost her job by sleeping with everyone in the office. Pat is aghast yet intrigued ""All of them?"" Soon a deal is struck She will smuggle a message to his wife through multiple restraining orders if he will agree to dance with her at an upcoming competition. All of this is incumbent of course on Pats surviving repeated iterations of ""Ma Cherie Amour""--one of his ""triggers"" and a song that recurs so inescapably during the film that it might tip anyone toward homicidal mania. Adapted by Russell from the novel by Matthew Quick Silver Linings Playbook teeters artfully between hilarity and violence tenderness and remorse. As he did in early works such as Spanking the Monkey and Flirting With Disaster the director profitably mines deep veins of insecurity and compulsion. Call it Love in the Time of Bipolar Disorder. And if the final act--featuring a high-stakes dance-off oddly reminiscent of The Fighter--is a touch rushed and tidy this is a film that has earned viewers indulgence.Silver Linings Playbook teeters artfully between hilarity and violence tenderness and remorse The cast which also features Jacki Weaver a mercifully low-key Chris Tucker Julia Stiles and Anupum Kher is uniformly excellent. De Niro in particular offers perhaps his best work in years as Pats on-the-edge meticulously superstitious dad. But the film ultimately belongs to its leads both of whom deliver eye-opening performances. Its always been evident that Lawrence can act--never more so than with her star-making role in 2010s Winters Bone. The revelation she offers in Silver Linings Playbook which filmed when she was just 21 is that she has graduated from playing wiser-than-their-years youngsters to full cinematic adulthood. I confess that I thought Cooper by contrast had reached the limits of his lupine charm in the Hangover movies and Hes Just Not That Into You and The A-Team that his would be a career of playing rakes and best friends and faithless husbands. (His last dramatic role in The Words did nothing to challenge this assumption.) But in Silver Linings Playbook he proves me wrong displaying a wholly unanticipated wit and vulnerability. While Lawrences precocity is remarkable its Cooper who offers the true epiphany Its never too late to grow up.

But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions.

""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

How generational divisions have driven down voter turnout over the last century of American politics. Throughout the 2016 U.S. presidential election pundits and activists have debated how to get more Millennials involved in politics always stressing their distinctive character. But it was actually this tendency to slice up the electorate into unique generations that drove young people from politics in the first place. In the 19th century children youths and adults ""mingled freely together"" at rowdy campaign rallies lured by the holy trinity of booze barbecue and bonfire. Older citizens introduced young people to politics helping to drive voter turnouts to their highest levels in U.S. history. ""Its the big fellow"" observed the Republicans canvassing in pool halls and saloons in the 1880s who does the best job getting ""the little fellow"" into politics.

He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed.

Homegoing By Yaa Gyasi In her first novel Yaa Gyasi cleverly weaves the intergenerational tale of a family through a series of short but interrelated stories set in whats now Ghana during the mid-18th century. The two women at the center of the novel Effia and Esi are half-sisters who wind up on vastly different paths. One is captured during a battle between tribes sold and winds up on a slave ship bound for the U.S. The other--separated from her village and married off to a British slaver--ends up living on top of the dungeons that hold her own kin and hundreds of others who would also become slaves. The novel traces the lineage of these women through the tales of their children and their childrens children and so on--up until the present day.

The words ""reactive attachment disorder"" are memory beads I gather into a pile and attempt to string along on a necklace. I think back to when Judith my neighbor who is a psychiatrist offhandedly threw out the term the first time she met Julia. We were talking about babies who start their lives in orphanages and she mentioned the disorder. She wasnt suggesting that my daughter Julia showed any signs but shed said it was a well-known problem with children whod been adopted from Romanian orphanages in the 80s and 90s. I remember nodding my head and thinking Shut up Judith. We got Julia young. It shouldnt be an issue.

Einstein once described his friend Michele Besso as ""the best sounding board in Europe"" for scientific ideas. They attended university together in Zurich; later they were colleagues at the patent office in Bern. When Besso died in the spring of 1955 Einstein--knowing that his own time was also running out--wrote a now-famous letter to Bessos family. ""Now he has departed this strange world a little ahead of me"" Einstein wrote of his friends passing. ""That signifies nothing. For us believing physicists the distinction between past present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."" Einsteins statement was not merely an attempt at consolation. Many physicists argue that Einsteins position is implied by the two pillars of modern physics Einsteins masterpiece the general theory of relativity and the Standard Model of particle physics. The laws that underlie these theories are time-symmetric--that is the physics they describe is the same regardless of whether the variable called ""time"" increases or decreases. Moreover they say nothing at all about the point we call ""now""--a special moment (or so it appears) for us but seemingly undefined when we talk about the universe at large. The resulting timeless cosmos is sometimes called a ""block universe""--a static block of space-time in which any flow of time or passage through it must presumably be a mental construct or other illusion.

We were exchanging tense emails while I was at my office and I began to feel the slow oozing onset of sleep the same tiredness that came on when as a child I rode in the backseat of the car on the way home from some undesired trip.

Russell. 31 Shares Share 24 Tweet 3 Share 0 Share Email Print Share Photo JOJO WHILDEN/The Weinstein Company. In the psycho-comedy Silver Linings Playbook bipolar Pat (Bradley Cooper) is newly sprung from a mental hospital and given to smashing things when reminded of his estranged wife with whom hes delusionally convinced hell be reunited. Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a cops widow who recently lost her job after sleeping with everyone -- everyone -- at her office might be even more disturbed. For writer-director David O. Russell theyre a hell-match made in heaven. He is by all accounts a tempestuous fellow given to screaming matches and fistfights with actors -- which I bring up not for gossips sake but because his movies at their best cultivate a certain emotional disequilibrium. Pat -- who lives with his parents and spends his days jogging to impress the wife who has taken out a restraining order against him -- fends off Tiffanys advances. But shes persistent When he heads out for a run shes suddenly behind him swerving into the frame in her tight tracksuit. They cant help but bond indelibly -- they spark off each others craziness. To convey Pats monomania Cooper speaks loudly and with little variation in pitch. Its not an especially imaginative performance but with his fixed blue eyes hes scary-pure. Its Lawrence who knocked me sideways. I loved her in Winters Bone and The Hunger Games but shes very young -- I didnt think she had this kind of deep-toned layered weirdness in her. The rest of the cast is fine although Robert DeNiros funny turn as Pat Sr. (He has obsessive-compulsive disorder) is basically Method throat-clearing. I wanted more of Chris Tucker as a fellow patient of Pats -- he finds an original rhythm thats like a collision of crisscrossing drugs legal and illegal. Silver Linings Playbook has a conventional climax -- a dance competition with much riding on the outcome -- and a rom-com finale. That part might make it a hit but I prefer the discombobulation.

Comments (2) click to enlarge Silver Linings Playbook Recommended Watch on Netflix Rated R  122 minutes  2012 Following a detour into heavy drama with The Fighter David O. Russell returns to his distinctive brand of neurotic screwball comedy and like his early features Spanking the Monkey (1994) and Flirting With Disaster (1996) this one somersaults giddily from sanity to insanity to sanity again. The hero (Bradley Cooper) having served eight months in a psych ward for assaulting his wifes lover wins release to the custody of his grumpy father (Robert De Niro) and solicitous mother (Jacki Weaver of Animal Kingdom). Given the young mans violent outbursts and delusional expectations of winning back his wife he seems bound for the loony bin again but things begin to turn around--and around and around--after he meets a young widow (Jennifer Lawrence) whos almost as unstable as he is.

(WEINSTEIN) Pat Solitano has a number of problems. Mood swings. Anxiety attacks. Violent rages. Auditory hallucinations. And a marriage that ended well pretty badly with an arrest and a restraining order. But now after eight months of court-ordered psychiatric treatment Pat is getting out with two new prescriptions a bed in the attic of his parents home and a plan to win back his wife. Being positive? Or just being delusional? The two often mix in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" a feel-good movie about feeling bad with Bradley Cooper as the problematic Pat. Painfully blunt and quick to anger he doesnt seem like someone whos likely to make his dreams come true. But then you meet his family - particularly his father a superstitious gambling addict and his older brother an aggressive underminer - and you cant help but see where Pats coming from. And root for him to finally get past it. Particularly when one of the new people in his life turns out to be Jennifer Lawrences Tiffany a painfully young widow with promiscuous urges and ballroom-competition dreams. It all sounds a little overstuffed with eccentricity - like one of director David O. Russells earlier films ""Flirting With Disaster."" But this isnt just a collection of oddballs (nor meant to be a serious study of mental illness). Its really a story about getting past your anger. Director David O. Russell knows something about that having developed a bad reputation in Hollywood for feuding with colleagues and getting called on it (Lily Tomlin cursed him out on ""I Heart Huckabees""; George Clooney had a rather more physical response during ""Three Kings""). But then Mark Wahlberg gave him ""The Fighter"" to direct and Russell not only made a hit of it he revived his career. And decided to spend his restored cred on this a determinedly offbeat romance and rather knowing portrait of self-destructive behavior Its its own gamble and Russell knows the risks. His film doesnt always successfully avoid them either sometimes treating Pats condition far too lightly - and as the ending draws near falling back on some predictable plotting to resolve things. But the larger subject fits Russells own fondness for jagged camerawork and characters (his first feature ""Spanking the Monkey"" was about a suburban teen who slept with his mother). And as usual hes put together an excellent cast working at the top of their form. Cooper has always had a kind of bloodshot intensity to him even outside the ""Hangover"" films here he gets the chance to marry it to a sad sweet optimism (part of his self-designed therapy is to see the ""silver linings"" in all the awful things that have happened to him). And playing Tiffany is a smart move for Jennifer Lawrence too. At 22 shes a little young for a policemans widow (and too young really for the nearly 40-year-old Cooper). But theres something hurt and sad in her softly wide and feline face; she manages to hint at wounds she never needs to explain. She also has a scene - rattling off football scores and trivial coincidences - that evokes Marisa Tomeis on-the-witness-stand car talk in ""My Cousin Vinnie."" Dont be surprised if it reminds Oscar voters too - enough to give her a supporting-actress nod. Add in a thankfully more-spirited-than-usual Robert De Niro as Pats father (and a thankfully less-manic-than usual Chris Tucker as one of Pats buddies from the hospital) and you have a rich and eccentric film that both takes gambles and delivers reassuringly safe pleasures. Its the sort of lively romantic comedy you might not have thought Russell could pull together - particularly when he seemed to be falling apart just a few years ago. But clearly he found his own silver lining. And a way to translate that into a treat for all of us. Ratings note The film contains strong language sexual situations brief nudity violence.

Photo Weinstein Company/Courtesy Ever Bradley Cooper could certainly learn something about acting from Jennifer Lawrence. ( ) Jennifer Lawrences smart funny and altogether masterful performance as a troubled widow in David O. Russells ""Silver Linings Playbook simply blows away the competition in this years race for the Best Actress Oscar. The 22-year-old star of the action blockbuster ""The Hunger Games not only cements her reputation as the finest actress of her generation in a wildly different kind of role but lends enough dramatic credibility to elevate a sentimental indie quirkfest into something more than a middling movie at best. Bradley Cooper -- who never lets you forget for a millisecond hes ""acting in his serious scenes -- is the films protagonist Pat a former high school history teacher in Philadelphia whos spent eight months in a mental hospital as part of a plea bargain after assaulting a male colleague he found taking a shower with his wife. Sprung to the custody of his long-suffering mom Dolores (the wonderful Jacki Weaver) Pat moves in with her and his dad Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro much less hammy than usual in a padded role) -- because Pat Jr.s wife has not only sold their former home but has also taken out a restraining order. That doesnt stop Pat from undertaking a self-improvement regime that includes reading his estranged wifes syllabus -- she teaches English -- and daily runs while wearing a garbage bag to lose weight all part of a quixotic plan to lure back Mrs. Pat. De Niros Pat Sr. -- a big-time fan of the Philadelphia Eagles and a struggling small-time bookie -- is dubious about Juniors plans and annoyed by the return of a son so compulsive he thinks nothing of waking his parents in the middle of the night to vent his rage over the unhappy ending of ""A Farewell to Arms."" A couple (John Ortiz and Julia Stiles) friendly with Pat and his estranged wife invite Junior to dinner where the recovering rage-aholic (officially diagnosed as bipolar) piques the interest of the womans sister newly widowed Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who cheerfully describes herself as ""a crazy slut with a dead husband."" Pat nixes Tiffanys instant invitation to spend the night together because hes optimistic about getting back together with his wife despite the considerable odds. But she quickly wears down his resistance to even being friends. Like quite a few other things in Russells screenplay -- based on a novel by Matthew Quick -- Tiffanys behavior might seem arbitrary or even downright contrived in the hands of an actress of a lesser caliber than Lawrence. Indeed shes such a sexy magnetic presence that sometimes you barely notice Cooper in their scenes together. At other times her sheer acting chops almost manage to convince you that the two wildly mismatched stars -- Lawrence is 15 years younger -- actually have chemistry together. She creates a crucial emotional investment as the plot gets more and more ridiculous and corny with Tiffany recruiting Pat as her partner in a dance competition -- on which his father bets his life savings in an absurd parley that even more improbably requires an Eagles victory over the Cowboys in the NFL playoffs. ""Silver Linings Playbook"" which has won audience awards at several film festivals -- and is being presented by the indie worlds Sultan of Schmaltz Harvey Weinstein -- is as shameless about pandering to moviegoers as the most formulaic big-studio product. That includes wringing laughs from some fairly egregious stereotypes. Chris Tucker makes a rare screen appearance as a mental-hospital pal of Pats who periodically escapes -- principally to teach Pat how to dance like a black man (really? In 2012?). And then theres Pats wacky Indian psychiatrist whos also a rabid Eagles fan . . . I must confess a relatively low tolerance for movies that romanticize much less trivialize serious mental illnesses such as bipolar disorder -- which here is laughed off as a somewhat charming quirk thats easily managed with medication. But thats probably to be expected from a director like Russell who has famous real-life issues with anger management. But because of Lawrence I just cant write off this movie. The way she inhabits an underwritten role is so amazing that despite reservations I can heartily recommend ""Silver Linings Playbook.""

Starring Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Director David O. Russell Running time 200 Release Opened Nov 16 2012  Editorial Review Perfect models of imperfectionBy Ann HornadayFriday Nov. 16 2012""Silver Linings Playbook"" serves as a textbook example of why directors matter. In any other hands the adaptation of Matthew Quicks novel would be the stuff of banal rom-com fluff or perhaps worse self-consciously quirky indie cliches. Thankfully this fractured fairy tale of mental illness family drama ragged romance and die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fandom has landed in the superbly capable hands of David O. Russell. In 2010 Russell proved that he could breathe fresh life into the come-from-behind sports saga in the grittily uplifting ""The Fighter."" Now he returns to the kind of off-kilter family dynamics he became famous for with such films as ""Spanking the Monkey"" and ""Flirting With Disaster"" taking an all-too-familiar scenario of domestic dysfunction and injecting it with both spontaneity and heart. As the movie opens Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is being discharged from a Baltimore psychiatric facility by his mother Dolores (Jacki Weaver) having been sent there after an incident involving his estranged wife. Determined to embark on a new life of positive thinking (""Excelsior"" is Pats mantra) Pat returns to his childhood home where his father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) runs a small book-making operation kept afloat by football bets superstition and obsessive-compulsive habits that suggest where Pat Jr. learned his more questionable coping strategies. Off his meds and ""white-knuckling it"" Pat Jr. resolves to reunite with his estranged wife Nikki. Meanwhile he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a sharp-tongued young widow with an acute nonsense-detector and a knack for brutal honesty equaled only by Pats own impulsive socially disastrous candor. ""Everythings under control"" Dolores says at one point. But nothings under control in this volatile petri dish of a world where emotions dart and glance off one another like so many highly charged pinballs. If ""Silver Linings Playbook"" often reverts to contrived devices -- including a climax that features not just one but two all-important competitive showdowns -- Russell choreographs them with a spare unfussy forthrightness as well as an unerring sense of place. Perhaps most important Russell doesnt shy from the absurd humor mental illness can sometimes entail; nor does he make it look cute. Rather ""Silver Linings Playbook"" invites viewers to consider whether we all dont exist on some kind of spectrum where the difference between a quirk and a symptom can be notional at best. The tonal balancing act he pulls off is helped enormously by actors who never overplay or try too hard to be liked De Niro delivers his warmest most astute performance in years and both Cooper and Lawrence successfully shed their movie-star glamour to play a couple of self-sabotaging misfits in search of a decent coping strategy. From the moment they meet and compare medication history Pat and Tiffany settle into a staccato argumentative rhythm with Tiffany bringing particular bite to their encounters (she has an utterly beguiling way of spitting when he does after ambushing him during his daily jogging sessions). The tart brutally frank chemistry that fuels ""Silver Linings Playbook"" plays out in the films visual approach which eschews air-brushed Hollywood aesthetics for a far more jagged intimate imperfection. Still Russell doesnt deprive the audience of old-fashioned pleasures including that rousing show-stopper toward the end. Would that every feel-good movie came by its good feelings so honestly. Contains language and some sexual content and nudity.

Silver Linings Playbook review 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Silver Linings Playbook Drama. Starring Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence and Robert De Niro. Directed by David O. Russell. (R. 122 minutes.) David O. Russells best films show a mastery of tone. In movies as divergent as ""Three Kings"" ""The Fighter"" and ""I Heart Huckabees"" he has demonstrated a perspective wide enough to incorporate the funny and the awful and to harmonize the tragic and the ridiculous. But its precisely that harmony and balance that are missing from his latest film ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Bradley Cooper in the kind of role that routinely gets Oscar talk for no reason plays Pat a man with bipolar disorder who gets released from a mental hospital after eight months inside. They locked him up apparently after he flipped out and almost beat a man to death. But then again he may have had a point Pat found the man in question having sex in the shower with Pats wife. Still he clearly has some kind of problem. He talks a mile a minute flings a novel through the window when he doesnt like the ending and gets into a screaming fit when he cant find his wedding video. He also goes crazy every time he hears the Stevie Wonder song ""My Cherie Amour."" (In this he might also have a point.) Clearly he is a burden to his friends and family and desperately needs to be on medication - medication he refuses to take. Cooper can be an engaging actor but he is not strictly speaking immediately lovable and so to see him acting like a borderline lunatic doesnt quite elicit sympathy as it might say if Tobey Maguire or George Clooney were cracking up. Coopers antics instead inspire impatience. Most of the first half of the film shows Pat in a variety of frustrating near-violent encounters brought about by his tendency to overreact. The slightest stress and he goes off. So Russell in adapting the novel by Matthew Quick is giving us a fairly serious situation. Yet the story places Pat in a family that cant be taken seriously. Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) is essentially a comic character a bookmaker who bets on the Philadelphia Eagles every week and is passionate in his superstitions. Likewise the movie is set against a portrait of Philadelphia life that might be intended as colorful and warm - with tailgate parties ethnic clashes and people painting their faces green - but instead is generalized and condescending. Its a strain to care about Pat and its impossible to believe in his world. A perfunctory scene two-thirds in with De Niro tearing up and showing Pat Sr.s true soul doesnt fill the void but makes things worse. It plays like the sort of special moment that actors insist on and agreeable directors sometimes include. Only Jennifer Lawrence as Tiffany a slightly neurotic young widow somehow finds the tonal balance that eludes Russell and the film as a whole. It may just be a matter of luck of having the best role or perhaps Russell deeply understood Tiffany and was able to guide the performance. In any case Lawrence stands out. Even when the banter between Pat and Tiffany becomes infected by the cutes - an infection going around and around in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" - she stays sympathetic and true. When Lawrence looks at Cooper its with an intensity that gradually makes you believe that theres something there. As a movie about mental illness ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is more lightweight than lighthearted. But thanks to Lawrence it does one good thing most movies dont do. It actually gets better as it goes along. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

USATODAY 1116 a.m. EST November 16 2012Tapping into the eternal optimist in all of us Silver Linings finds humor and redemption in dysfunctional families mental illness and infidelity.Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper in the comedy Silver Linings Playbook which earned four nominations.(Photo The Weinstein Co.)Story HighlightsUSA TODAY Review  out of fourStars Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Jacki Weaver Chris TuckerRated R; Runtime 2 hours 2 minutes; Opens Friday in select citiesIntelligent adult-centered comedies with something to say about the human condition are like rare gems among the plastic beads Hollywood tosses at audiences.Silver Linings Playbook ( out of four; rated R; opening Friday in select cities) falls neatly into the jewel category.Though not as daffily inventive as director David O. Russells best comedy Flirting with Disaster (1996)Silver Linings is consistently entertaining with its scrappy well-drawn characters offbeat humor and indefatigable positive outlook.When we first encounter him Pat (Bradley Cooper) is leaving a mental institution where he has been confined for eight months. Diagnosed with bi-polar disorder Pat plea-bargained his way into the psychiatric facility after being convicted of violently assaulting a colleague whom he came home to find in the shower with his wife. Since that incident Pat has lost his wife his teaching job his home and much of his self-respect.MORE Latest news reviews amp; coverage of all things film at USA TODAY Movies Even as he moves back home with his mom (Jacki Weaver) and dad (Robert De Niro) Pat vows to re-claim his life and win back his estranged wife -- despite her restraining order against him.Pats well-meaning but oddball parents are rooting for him though perhaps not as intensely as they root for the Philadelphia Eagles. His dad Pat Sr. wants his son to join him in obsessive fandom. The older mans fanaticism however is fueled by obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pat Sr.s OCD helps fuel his illegal betting scheme with superstitious vigor.What nudges Pat toward happiness is meeting Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a young widow beset by low self-esteem. As Pat insists on getting back together with his wife Tiffany offers to help -- if hell do something for her in return. She needs a dance partner for a local contest. Practicing their moves they gradually begin to sidestep their heartaches.Serious mental illness is not portrayed with full authenticity here yet Russells script based on Matthew Quicks novel Playbook captures a range of eccentricity with comic finesse.Unlike standard rom-coms Pat isnt just nerdy shy or recovering from a break-up -- he has a serious psychological malady. Tiffany struggles with depression. Shortly after they meet they compare the merits of all the meds theyve been prescribed. A romantic comedy centered on such troubled souls is refreshingly outside the box.The ensemble cast is terrific especially the complex patriarch played by De Niro and Weavers well-meaning but rattled mom. Chris Tucker is hilarious in a small but memorable role as one of Pats institutional inmates.This is easily Coopers most multidimensional role. Hes convincing as a manic charmer whose hair-trigger rage hits overdrive at the sweet sounds of Stevie Wonders My Cherie Amour.Lawrence continues to demonstrate her versatility having segued from the hard-luck heroine of Winters Boneto Katniss the fierce athlete in The Hunger Games to this romantic lead marked by sharp comic timing and energetic charm. At 22 she already is one of the most talented actresses in the business.While Cooper and Lawrence have a potent chemistry thats hard to resist those whose tastes run to more realistic romance may find themselves wishing that Pat and Tiffany had worked through their respective psychological problems before hooking up.But realism is not a requirement at the movies. Silver Linings gets major points for quirky humor deft pacing and complex characters. Its a pleasure to be reminded that optimism pays off and happy endings dont have to be sappy. 18 CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/XHLHQX,http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/11/15/silver-linings-playbook-review/1687035/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UsatodaycomMovies-TopStories+%28Life+-+Movies+-+Top+Stories%29&utm_content=Google+Reader,200,silverliningsplaybook25,silverliningsplaybook,usatoday
Silver Linings Playbook (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Silver Linings Playbook (R) Bradley Cooper shows hes leading man material after all in this offbeat romantic comedy. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com11/15/2012 Editor rating 3.5 The various characters in Silver Linings Playbook are gamblers addicts widows adulterers and occasionally violent. Some are certifiably insane. This is writer-director David O. Russells idea of a romantic comedy and its terrific -- one of the freshest funniest most elevating crowd-pleasers of the year. Like Russells previous entry into the rom-com genre (1996s Flirting with Disaster) the movie uses a hearty and deep ensemble cast to distract from the formulaic nature of the plot. You know where this one is headed from the start but the journey is sheer pleasure and filled with surprising strange detours. Adapted from Matthew Quicks novel the film opens as Pat (Bradley Cooper) a former schoolteacher who had a breakdown when he walked in on his wife with another man is released from a mental institution. Hes not entirely cured of his violent outbursts -- he finishes Ernest Hemingways A Farewell to Arms and chucks the book through a glass window because hes angry over the sad ending -- but hes trying. His forgiving mother (Jacki Weaver radiating warmth and love) tries her best to keep her son calm and happy. His father (Robert De Niro in his liveliest performance in years) is a superstitious bookie who tries to draw Pat into his obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles. Even though his wife has a restraining order on him Pat still tells everyone hes married and believes he will somehow be able to win her back. When he meets Tiffany (a shockingly adult Jennifer Lawrence leagues away from her adolescent Hunger Games persona) a widow who shares his manic-depressive ways she doesnt even register as a possible romantic interest. Part of the fun in Silver Linings Playbook is how long Russell makes us wait for Pat to realize whats standing right in front of him Hes too obsessed with the past and atoning for his bad behavior to be aware of the present. The style of Silver Linings Playbook is intentionally rough and messy with characters talking over each other a la Robert Altman and Russells camera weaving through rooms without always telling you where you should look. The picture captures the boisterous nature of an extended group of relatives and the things we put up with for the sake of family. The directors touch is present in every beat of the film from the uniformly great performances (Cooper in particular is amazing here; for the first time in his career he comes across as a true leading man) to the off-kilter rhythm of the humor. The movie doesnt break any thematic ground and in other hands this same material which climaxes with a high-stakes dance contest () might have made for an insufferable Katherine Heigl vehicle. But Russell and his cast make it sing -- and soar too. This is a wonderful movie that makes something really difficult seem easy Getting you to fall in love with characters that bear little relation to the real world.

"Silver Linings Playbook is irresistibly eccentric movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-ObsessionsMovie review Silver Linings Playbook is irresistibly eccentricBradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are superb as unstable people thrown together by chance and linked through their obsessions with director David O. Russell nimbly making the uneasy alliance work.November 15 2012|By Kenneth Turan Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is rich in lifes complications. It will make you laugh but dont expect it to fit in any snug genre pigeonhole. Dramatic emotional even heartbreaking as well as wickedly funny it has the gift of going its own way a complete success from a singular talent.That would be the gifted writer-director David O. Russell whose triumph with ""The Fighter"" two years ago marked a return to form after a spate of lean years. Russell whose early successes include ""Three Kings"" and ""Flirting With Disaster"" always brings intensity and passion to the proceedings We arent coolly observing life in his films we are compelled to live it full-bore along with his characters.Upping the ante this time around are a pair of obsessive unbalanced protagonists splendidly played in different than usual roles by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence whose lives not to put too fine a point on it threaten to spiral out of control on a daily basis.BUZZMETER Silver Linings Playbooks awards outlookBattling in very different a and often painfully hilarious a ways to stay rational Pat and Tiffany have got to wonder if accepting the attraction thats in the air between them will only increase their problems and make them crazier than they already are.""Silver Linings"" based on an engaging novel by Matthew Quick benefits from more than Russells intensity. A father whose son in the filmmakers words ""has been through challenging emotional trials"" Russells work is informed by an intimate empathetic understanding of what its like in those moments when you feel a stranger to sanity when an edgy sense of risk uncertainty and even danger manages to invade the commonplace and the everyday.Its Pat whos introduced first on his last day at a psychiatric hospital in Baltimore where hes been an involuntary resident for eight months. (Look for Chris Tucker in an irresistible supporting role as a fellow patient). Even though hes well enough to be sprung by his mother Dolores (a dead-on Jackie Weaver) and brought home to Philadelphia Pat remains bipolar and not even close to being over the situation that put him inside in the first place his obsession with his estranged wife Nikki.THE ENVELOPE The awards and industry insiderThough Nikkis reasons (soon revealed) for not wanting Pat around are strong enough that shes protected herself with a restraining order against him Pat absolutely refuses to be discouraged. A manic optimist he believes ""if you stay positive you have a shot at a silver lining"" a happy ending to your life and that is what hes bound and determined to achieve.Coopers persuasive work here couldnt be more different from his earlier starring roles in the ""Hangover"" films. Thought Pat is handsome and likable his uncompromising ferocity is more than a little scary especially to his family which he awakens on his first night back with a wild and crazy 4 a.m. rant about true story Ernest Hemingways ""A Farewell to Arms."" Pat confidently tells everyone he meets ""I am better now"" but the truth is hes barely holding it together.More aware of that than most is Pats father Pat Sr. played by Robert De Niro with the kind of conviction he rarely brings to comic roles. A fanatical Philadelphia Eagles fan whos so obsessive about possible jinxes he has a meltdown when anyone touches his TVs remote control Pat Sr. is working as a bookie and has so many anger-management issues of his own that hes been banned from the teams home field for fighting.PHOTOS Hollywood back lot momentsGiven how laser-focused Pat is on getting Nikki back (he read the Hemingway novel because its on the high school English syllabus she teaches) its not surprising that socializing of any kind is not exactly high on his agenda. But friends with different ideas put together a dinner where he meets Tiffany (Lawrence) an attractive young widow who has considerable problems of her own stemming from the circumstances surrounding her husbands death and her reaction to them.Despite enormous wariness and disinterest on both sides plus Pats Tourettes-type weakness for blurting out exactly what he shouldnt be saying the two actually find something to talk about that night as they knowledgeably compare the efficacy of their respective psychotropic medications.Though Lawrence has been memorable in films as diverse as ""Winters Bone"" and ""The Hunger Games"" its still the pleasantest of shocks to see how terrific she is here in a completely different kind of fiercely comic completely charismatic performance. Lawrence and Cooper face off in the most convincing way matching each other stride for crazed stride. It would spoil the fun to even hint at all what goes down between two people equally possessed by partners who are not coming back but you can be sure it wont be dull.Thats also true for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" as a whole. Russells gift for smart honest and unexpected dialogue and situations keeps you off-balance in an almost addictive way. Hes brought a reality to the worlds damaged uncertain strivers that makes them next door to irresistible and that cant have been an easy thing to do.---MPAA rating R for language and some sexual content/nudityRunning time 2 hours 2 minutesIn general releasekenneth.turanlatimes.com PHOTOS AND MORE VIDEO A guide to upcoming movies The Envelope Awards Insider PHOTOS NC-17 movies Ratings explained MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESHas David O.

When Bradley Coopers Pat recently sprung from eight months in a mental hospital walks into his doctors office and hears the strains of the song that accompanied his breakdown -- it happens to be Stevie Wonders ""My Cherie Amour"" -- his impossibly blue eyes seem to spiral into tiny pin dots like those of a tortured bull.

Moments like that work beautifully in Silver Linings Playbook; in fact its more a movie of moments than a story with anything resembling a narrative drive. (Russell also wrote the screenplay adapting it from Matthew Quicks novel of the same name.) As the movie opens Pat is being sprung from the hospital a little early thanks to the intercession of his cautiously supportive mother (Jacki Weaver) and seemingly against the better judgment of his less-supportive dad (Robert De Niro). Hes feeling better or so he thinks and hes eager to get back to real life although his hopes for that life are stupendously unrealistic. He believes he can rebuild his marriage even though his estranged wife has taken out a restraining order against him. (His discovery of her extramarital affair instigated the act of violence that got him put away in the first place.) Pat cant be swayed from his mission to get his wife back not even when he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) the tough-cookie sister-in-law of one of his closest friends. (In a stroke of cockeyed genius Russell has cast Julia Stiles and Lawrence as siblings and with their moon-shaped faces and alert inquisitive eyes theyre like a pair of take-no-prisoners cherubim.) i After spending time in a institution Pat moves in with his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) while he tries to repair his relationship with his wife.

After spending time in a institution Pat moves in with his parents (Jacki Weaver and Robert De Niro) while he tries to repair his relationship with his wife. The Weinstein Co. But Tiffany only looks tough Her husband a cop has recently died and in her extreme grief shes turned to sex -- lots of it -- as a coping mechanism. Pat takes one look at her adorably curvy figure kitted out in semi-Goth clothes and falls hard. Though of course he doesnt know it yet. That setup is easy enough to buy. But in the movies last half the plotting begins to make less sense Pats wife re-enters the scene in a wholly unbelievable way and one particular element of Pats recovery hinges on a ridiculous sports-related bet -- thats where the titles ""playbook"" angle figures in and its not a particularly convincing fit. But even when you cant fully believe in the plot of Silver Linings Playbook or in its occasionally self-helpy dialogue its easy enough to believe in the actors faces. De Niro plays your stock disapproving dad but with an OCD twist. He may not bear much physical resemblance to Coopers Pat but his nervous mannerisms suggest that the apple hasnt fallen so far from the tree. Pat is a royal pain in the neck to his family and to almost everyone else Even his mother played marvelously by Weaver struggles with the task of loving him unconditionally. Her face bears the strain of all that forced cheerfulness -- shes like an anxious forest-animal mom straight out of Beatrix Potter all bright eyes and wriggly nose hoping against hope for the best. Lawrence plays Tiffany with the right proportions of ironclad determination and self-protectiveness This isnt a character given to self-pity but that doesnt mean she doesnt feel pain and her refusal to accept Pats little-boy-lost excuses for his bad behavior is bracing. And Coopers performance meets Lawrences beautifully halfway. The affected swagger of so many of his performances -- the very thing that generally makes him so unbearable as an actor -- has dissolved away here. We can see that this is a guy trapped on his own internal hamster wheel; the zig-zaggy logic of his speech makes sense obliquely and yet its hardly conducive to peaceful living. Pat is no fun to be around. But then its no fun being him either. And this is where Coopers coolness as an actor comes into play As corrosive and damaging as Pat is to those around him all of his sharpest edges are on the inside. Cooper keeps every razor blade out of sight.

After a stint in a mental institution Pat (Bradley Cooper) moves back in with his parents and meets a girl (Jennifer Lawrence) with her own problems. (Photo amp; Video Weinstein Co.) By Joe Morgenstern Nov. 15 2012 501 p.m. ET Everything comes together brilliantly in ""Silver Linings Playbook""--for the films crazed but uncrazy lovers; for the filmmaker David O. Russell and best of all for lucky us. Mr. Russells sixth feature goes beyond flirting with disaster to borrow the title of his second one even beyond catching lightning in a bottle. This romantic comedy of prickly passions and rampant dysfunction is like a fusion machine that constantly threatens to blow up while its seeking some sort of equilibrium and releasing epic energy in the process. The stars are Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. You may well know Mr. Cooper from his huge commercial success in ""The Hangover"" but nothing hes done on screen until now has even hinted at the phenomenal performance he gives here as Pat a wildly volatile Philadelphian who comes home to his wildly volatile family after spending eight months in a psychiatric hospital. Ms. Lawrences work is less surprising in the context of her brief career. She too has recently had a huge commercial success as Katniss Everdeen the heroine of ""The Hunger Games"" but her portrait of the fiercely indomitable Ree Dolly in ""Winters Bone"" gave plenty of hints of the purity intensity and heartbreaking beauty--though not the sensational gift for comedy--she lavishes on the role of Tiffany a young woman whos had more than her share of craziness and loss. In its bare bones ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a story of two lost souls who find each other. And in clinical terms Pat is probably bipolar while Tiffany has been struggling with depression. But that sort of reductionism is the equivalent of saying that ""Three Kings"" Mr. Russells stirring--and hilarious--morality tale set in the aftermath of the first Gulf War was a gold-bullion caper. ENLARGE Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence in Silver Linings Playbook. The Weinstein Company His new film which he adapted from a novel by Matthew Quick is indeed about such serious things as desperation spiritual isolation obsession and confusion. Yet the wonder of his achievement is that its deeply serious and blissfully funny at the same time because its also about yearning and desire fantastic flights of language the persistence of hope and the possibility of healing love. Oh and the doomed loyalty of Philadelphia Eagles fans. ( Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver are terrific as respectively Pats father an obsessive-compulsive gambler and Eagles fanatic and his mother a good woman beset by appropriate anxiety. Chris Tucker is memorably funny in the small role of Danny Pats exuberant buddy from the hospital ward.) In the disturbance derby of the plot Pat runs several lengths ahead of Tiffany. A compulsive jogger who wears a garbage bag to maximize sweating he also runs off at the mouth uncontrollably ""I have no filter when I talk"" he tells her as if she hadnt noticed. Hes delusional about his chances which in reality range from slim to none of regaining what he has lost since his involuntary hospitalization. The list includes his wife house career possessions equanimity and place in the world. His eyes dart ceaselessly as he takes inventory of who likes or dislikes him. His mind dances on the brink of explosion. ""Work on a strategy"" his sensible shrink Dr. Patel tells him; hes played with delightful forthrightness by Anupam Kher. But strategic thinking is not the heros strong suit. Pat lives in the moment frightened and aggressive in equal measure. He rattles on about positivity and ""a shot at silver linings"" yet he cant seem to appreciate the shot hes got in the person of Tiffany who keeps flashing across his jogging orbit like a rogue comet. She has her own problems. Tiffany has made a mess of her relatively short randomized life and she doesnt have much insight into why. ""I dont get what I want"" she tells Pat in a moment of poignant candor. (The age difference between the two stars is noticeable but not intrusive.) Still shes always on the level even if her level stands at a slight angle to everyone elses; shes whip smart with eloquence to match her intelligence--her extended comic riff on her mystical influence over the Eagles is nothing short of sublime--and shes as open to feeling as Pat is closed. ""Do you feel that?"" Tiffany asks at one point when he isnt feeling anything. ""Thats emotion."" Yes it is and thats what suffuses every one of their scenes together whether theyre comparing meds turning a misbegotten meal at a diner into an encounter of urgent intimacy or lowering their defenses long enough to practice for a dance competition that isnt as crazy as it seems. Mr. Cooper serves up Pats feelings of anger and suspicion at white heat--the actors verbal and emotional agility left me agog--and he heightens Pats feelings of hurt and love through deft concealment. Ms. Lawrence expresses a full spectrum of Tiffanys feelings with a limited vocal range that made me think of Billie Holiday except that these limits are self-imposed and she matches Mr. Coopers complexity with exquisite simplicity as in the moment when Tiffany says ""Theres always going to be a part of me thats sloppy and dirty and Im OK with that."" The more these two combatants attack abrade or wound one another the more vivid the sense of bewildered untethered souls coming perilously close to loving and supporting one another and of a movie that wasnt written but somehow burst out of its characters mouths. That kind of spontaneity isnt new to the filmmakers style. The energy level was startlingly high in ""Three Kings"" and even more so in ""The Fighter"" Mr. Russell has inherited the mantle of Robert Altman when it comes to dialogue that surges ebbs and flows with the rhythms of life. And the concern with family life isnt new either ""Flirting With Disaster"" was in its antic way about a quest for family connections; ""The Fighter"" was about family ties that turn toxic and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" gives us a family lurching crabwise through chaos toward redemption. Whats new about this film which was photographed by Masanobu Takayanagi is how full and thrillingly free it is Mr. Russells control has become so confident as to seem loose almost reckless. He has thrown drama farce and comedy together with piercingly astute perceptions of mental illness and topped the whole thing off with lyrical romance. One sequence toward the end feels like it was shot on an old-fashioned movie set; its a lovely grace note in the best movie so far this year. Watch a clip from the film ""Anna Karenina."" Based on the Tolstoy novel 19th-century aristocrat Anna Karenina (Keira Knightley) enters into a life-changing affair. Also starring Jude Law and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. (Photo amp; Video Focus Features) Anna Karenina Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way as Tolstoy famously said in ""Anna Karenina"" and every misconceived screen adaptation is misconceived in its own way. Last months flagrant example was ""Cloud Atlas"" which flitted back and forth across the centuries turning off our emotional--and even intellectual--connection with each and every frequent flit. Now its a new version of ""Anna"" which was adapted by no less a dramatic light than Tom Stoppard and directed by Joe Wright who directed the intriguing adaptation of Ian McEwans ""Atonement."" Unlike ""Cloud Atlas"" where decisions about structure seemed to have been made with a helpless shrug this latest iteration of the Tolstoy classic was clearly the product of audacious thinking stylishly applied. Still the thinking was as wrongheaded as it was hollow-hearted. Yet another elaborate production chases its audience away. The problem in search of a solution was an interesting one How do you tell a classic story to contemporary moviegoers who are turned off and understandably so by the tired techniques of classic cinema? (And how do you tell this particular story when there is no Garbo or Vivien Leigh to capture the publics imagination?) Mr. Wright and his colleagues have borrowed the conventions and visual language of live theater--almost everything takes place on or around little 19th-century stage sets--to remind us that film is artifice a medium to be observed at a certain distance with a certain sense of irony. ENLARGE Keira Knightley as Anna in ""Anna Karenina. Focus Features The results are striking and sometimes sumptuous toy trains or charmingly fake stage trains covered with fake snow as they shuttle between St. Petersburg and Moscow; elegant balls staged as comic opera; the horse race as process background for a theater turned into a paddock; a theater awash in a meadows white flowers. Keira Knightley is fine as the doomed heroine and her dance with Vronsky is choreographed like Ravels ""La Valse"" with mounting intensity but shes always accompanied by overwrought music or distracting theatrics as opposed to Alicia Vikander (the beguiling young queen in ""A Royal Affair"") whos allowed to play Levins wife Kitty with all the simplicity at her command. If theres such a malady as hyperenchantment this production suffers from it. While I was watching eyes glazed from the too-muchness of it all I thought of ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" the 1964 French-language classic that put its characters--its singing characters since theres no spoken dialogue--inside pretty little dollhouse sets. That technique worked magically by conferring a physical confinement that served as a counterpart of the lovers imprisoning fate. The ropes and curtains and ladders of this ""Anna Karenina"" serve mainly as distractions. And theyre solutions to a part of the problem that doesnt exist. Contemporary moviegoers know perfectly well that all the tricks of todays movie trade--the quick cuts the CGI the heightened colors the impossible zooms--arent reflections of objective reality. The real trick is using movie tools to help keep us rapt in the picture. --J.M. --Email Joe at joe.morgensternwsj.com and follow him on Twitter JoeMorgenstern.

"Movie review Silver Linings Playbook - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate For Bradley Cooper a vulnerable role in Silver Linings Playbook Share Tweet Share Tweet By Wesley Morris Globe Staff | 11.16.12 | 522 PM Given the weight length scope and moral purpose of some of the movies currently begging you to watch them -- the abolition of slavery in ""Lincoln"" the triumph over addiction in ""Flight"" the unstoppable ATM-ness of the 007 franchise in ""Skyfall"" -- its possible to forget the pleasure to be had in relative lightness. Hollywood has gotten away from the serious comedies that once were among its specialties. Those have been farmed out to television where subtlety social commentary and eccentricity mock the obviousness and idiocy of the movie comedy at the moment. Yet no matter how grim its looking for certain kinds of laughter as long as theres David O. Russell things will be OK. Were so infrequently given the small the intimate the deathless the funny that when we get a movie from Russell -- ""The Fighter"" was his previous one -- our involuntary response is to love it desperately apocalyptically like its the last serious comedy on Earth. His new film is ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and its at least the last and best such movie of the year. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters The film introduces us to Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) a schoolteacher leaving a Philadelphia mental hospital to live with his parents and refusing to take the medication prescribed to prevent him from going back. Hes prone to violent anger envious of his older brother and convinced that his estranged adulterous wife is still in love with him. Its a delusion somehow heightened by his prickly new friendship with a droll oversexed equally unstable younger woman Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) -- the widowed sister of his wifes best friend (Julia Stiles). Pat and Tiffany get reacquainted at a small dinner where in one of at least half a dozen beautifully written and orchestrated exchanges they bond over pharmaceuticals in front their two unmedicated companions. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Russell adapted the movie from a novel by Matthew Quick (who lives in Massachusetts) and what ultimately happens between Pat and Tiffany is expected. But nothing that keeps them together -- not the bargains they strike the shouting fights they have the lies they tell nor the cruel honesty they inflict upon each other -- is ordinary or predictable. One deal involves Pat agreeing with severe reluctance to be Tiffanys partner in a professional dance competition. Will he chicken out? Will she fall in love with him even though hes unwaveringly obsessed with his largely unseen wife? Will anyone acknowledge that Pats troubles might be related to the obsessive-compulsive disorder of his father Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) whose gambling is abetted by a meek kooky wife Dolores (Jacki Weaver). The movie takes an audacious approach. One evening Dolores tries to calm a fight between Pat and Pat Sr. that turns verbal then physical then into the sort of situation that forces a neighbor to call the police. By almost any standard this should be a cataclysmic entanglement one that Russell initially overdoes -- the Led Zeppelin on the soundtrack is too loud; the hand-held camera and editing too erratic. But neighbors whove called the police appear to have done so for the comic potential of having a nincompoop cop played by Dash Mihok interrupt the drama to deliver comic relief. That scene is typical of Russell. Its as if he checked the emotional weather saw the forecast called for snow and chose to wear shorts and a tank top anyway. Hes like Preston Sturges in that sense fearlessly -- and not always successfully -- shepherding crises away from tragedy sensing we can see the stakes more clearly when were not watching them through tears. Hes different from the other screwball directors that way. His feet remain more firmly planted. You couldnt always say that about him. The snob in Russell would have bristled at the soiled melodrama of a film like this or ""The Fighter"" at all the happy emotional cohesion. These two movies are unexpectedly authentic works of blue-collar regionalism (""The Fighter"" was set in Lowell) structured around the vivid quirks of sport. Russell isnt seeing class or place per se (he couldnt be here; there are barely any Philadelphia accents). Hes seeing people lives and situations. Yes De Niro is playing a Philadelphia Eagles fanatic but he always sounds like a man rooting against them at Giants Stadium. Cooper grew up in Philadelphia and uses only the mildest of accents. Still its a relief to see him with a part that lets him do something other than ooze. Hes always had the self-confidence of a star but hes never had a part that lets him do much with it. Here he winds himself up until he can barely match the pace of Pats ranting arias like hes talking faster than he can think. Thats the character a manic-depressive tired of climbing this mood-enhanced StairMaster. Cooper gives the performance just the right lunacy and doubt. Its a happy surprise like watching a goofball student finally ace an exam. Its wonderful to hear what Cooper and Lawrence can do with great dialogue and complicated feelings also what they can do as part of a larger acting team especially alongside a hale in-rare-form De Niro. Youre initially wary that Lawrence has been cast because sexy ingenues like her are what happens when straight men take their fantasies out on us. But you realize that shes just in need of more parts as full as her figure. Shes built like the pinups from 50 years ago and in this movie she has the authority of a star even older than that. When she gives a rousing authoritative speech about football statistics its a shock both because no one in the movie expects it of Tiffany and no one in the audience expects it of Lawrence. The rest of the cast includes Paul Herman John Ortiz Shea Whigham Anupam Kher and Chris Tucker and even once the movies coincidences and human pileups have strained all credibility the sound of them all shouting over each other or racing around a downtown ballroom is just such a satisfying display of kinetic teamwork that we begin to accept the movies implausibilities as part of a larger social fable. You come to appreciate that the six- or seven-person argument is as dear to Russell as car chases were to John Frankenheimer. Russell began his career in the mid-1990s on the margins of mainstream moviemaking with the droll riff on incest ""Spanking the Monkey"" and gradually permeated the industrys membrane with ""Flirting With Disaster"" ""Three Kings"" ""I Heart Huckabees"" and ""The Fighter."" Hes evolved into Hollywoods most instinctive director of ensemble comedies. Theyre starry hyper-intelligent over-caffeinated crazed adventures in screwball comedy. They take on the philosophic the neurotic and the familial. Their characters are searching for ideas and moral high ground and people. Theyre trying to figure out where they belong in the universe in war zones in their bloodlines. Theyre trying to find some balance between the sane and the crazy between judgment and compassion. But the exhilarating truth of the David O. Russell experience is that -- philosophy and pharmaceuticals be damned -- the balance doesnt exist Were all just kind of nuts.

"Review Silver Linings Playbook - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Silver Linings Playbook Humanity in high-maintenance characters  1/2 Silver Linings Playbook Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Hollywood movies and even off-Hollywood independent films have long encouraged us to empathize with unstable or psychologically troubled characters only if theyre ""kooky"" for a little while as a prelude to more palatable normalized levels of craziness. You know. The charming kind. Happy ending followed by a fade to a sunny shade of black.This helps to explain why Paul Thomas Andersons ""The Master"" never was destined to click with even a sliver of the American mainstream. A lot of filmgoers get nervous about spending money and time on serious head cases unless theyre Bond villains. David O. Russells pungent romantic comedy ""Silver Linings Playbook"" takes some risks en route to its own happy ending. And I say good for Russell for risking a protagonist who requires some patience and forgiveness.This is Russells first picture since his very fine film ""The Fighter"" two years ago. It offers many of that films strengths local color; working-class authenticity; a disarming mixture of moods and tonalities; and performances that are a tiny bit larger than life but in a convivial lived-in way. Russell has adapted Matthew Quicks clever first novel so as to make the storys deeply embedded quirks his own or rather his characters own.For a while there in the Philadelphia-set ""Silver Linings Playbook"" the unruly protagonist played by Bradley Cooper by Russells admission is an off-putting guy on which to hang a feel-good Oscar-season hopeful. We meet Pat Solatano (Pat Peoples in the novel) as hes finishing up eight months in a state mental health institution. Slowly we learn the circumstances He is married to a fellow high school teacher though Pat himself has lost his job owing to a violent incident alluded to early on and revealed in full later.For better and for worse Pat goes back to living with his folks a father (Robert De Niro excitingly fully engaged) obsessed with the fortunes of the Philadelphia Eagles and a mother (Australian native Jacki Weaver right at home in the land of cheesesteak) long used to coping with hot-headed punch-throwing temperaments. Pat longs for a reunion with his estranged wife Nikki (Brea Bee) but there are little roadblocks including a restraining order. Then into this bipolar mans uncertain life comes Tiffany a deceased policemans widow played by Jennifer Lawrence.Clearly in novelistic and movie terms these two were made for each other. But her reputation in this tribal Philly neighborhood precedes her Shes a ""slut"" burying her grief in a string of bantamweight affairs. She and Pat become running partners (shes more like his runner-stalker) and although the feelings that pass between these two hard-shell characters are genuine they relate in terms of pure expedience. She needs a dance partner for an upcoming ballroom competition; in exchange for his services Tiffany will act as a go-between for Pat and Nikki aiding his quixotic quest to get back to his elusive old life. Like the family scenes in ""The Fighter"" with all that immense hair and tangled loyalties the family scenes in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" are just exaggerated (or distilled) enough to work as character-based comedy yet staying this side of caricature. De Niros patriarch doesnt know what to make of his angry delusional son nor what to make of his own past behavior. Theyre brawlers and if the brawls in question are Eagles-related what better cause?For the movie to work which it does Russell needed to make Pat and Tiffany more than cogs in a rom-com wheel. Happily Russells skills as a writer and a director are roughly equal; each time for example Tiffany zings into the frame on another one of Pats purposeful morning jogs the timing is spot on. Lawrence is a remarkable actress tough and forthright and well un-actressy. The ""local color"" the people on screen who clearly arent professional actors blend in with the ensemble seamlessly.Russells primarily concession to a popular audience I suppose comes in the relocation (from the books two-thirds point to the films climax) of the ballroom dance sequence. Its shameless in its way but its way is both time-honored and here cornily effective. Russell it must be said goes easy on Pats behavior past and present. But Coopers performance is his best yet. As is Lawrences (the more crucial role in fact). Chris Tucker as Pats fellow institution resident newly sprung works in a different key (thank God) than he did in the ""Rush Hour"" films. And it really is a pleasure to be reminded of De Niros range and instincts when hes stepping up. That range may not be expansive but it is wholly truly expressive much like this eccentric ode to family itself.mjphillipstribune.comSilver Linings Playbook -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for sexual content nudity and language)Running time 202Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies Silver Linings Playbook (movie) The Fighter (movie) Bradley Cooper The Master (movie) Paul Thomas Anderson Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising76deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1113-silver-linings-playbook-20121115,0,1902708.column",200,silverliningsplaybook31,silverliningsplaybook,chicagotribune

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Stress is the engine that makes David O. Russells comedies go like a Bunsen burner set under unstable human chemistry. Its true of his debut feature Spanking The Monkey with its escalating sexual frustration and Freudian weirdness; its true of Flirting With Disaster and I [Heart] Huckabees which make screwball comedy out of hyper-neurotic characters; and its true of Three Kings which spins a Treasure Of The Sierra Madre adventure out of the gnawing boredom and anxiety of serving in the Gulf. His movies are about the quest for some kind of psychological equilibrium some way for his characters to settle their nerves and make themselves whole again. And when they get there its a triumph. Based on Matthew Quicks novel Russells new film Silver Linings Playbook is about a couple of head cases whose romantic chemistry stabilizes their brain chemistry. Its the perfect material for Russell who not only deals perceptively with the dizzying swings of manic depression but makes it the fabric of a big generous happy-making ensemble comedy. Pushing his usual smug cheeriness to the brink of derangement Bradley Cooper stars as a former substitute teacher whos just spent the last seven months in a mental institution for assaulting his wifes lover. Hes released almost certainly too soon to his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver) in suburban Philadelphia and he begins obsessing unhealthily about straightening up and winning his wife back. When he meets Jennifer Lawrence a young widow with a similarly absent social filter and compatible antipsychotics the two enter into uneasy friendship premised on an arrangement. If Cooper partners with Lawrence for a dance competition she will help him get back in touch with his wife. It isnt entirely insulting to say that Silver Linings Playbook while sweet and immensely satisfying is also full of beans. Theres real-crazy and theres movie-crazy and Russell gets what he needs from the former (which is really hard to resolve) in order to settle on the latter (which is really easy to resolve)--ultimately mental illness serves as the vehicle that gets these two quirky characters to the crowd-pleasing place the film needs them to go. Yet Silver Linings Playbook is pleasing with vibrant performances from its leads and about a dozen well-sketched characters up and down the ensemble including Chris Tucker as a cheerful flight risk from the ward Anupam Kher as Coopers outwardly successful but secretly unraveling best friend and De Niro who looks as engaged as hes been in years as Coopers father a superstitious bookie with a love for the Eagles akin to Anjelica Hustons Buffalo Bills psychosis in Buffalo 66. Russell brings these high-strung characters together in a harmony of comic dysfunction that few other filmmakers could achieve without the film falling into chaos. He may be guilty of angling toward a crowd-pleasing finish but resistance is futile.

Russell even gets actual performances out of Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper Hardcore art-house enthusiasts might remember the 2003 documentary ""The Five Obstructions"" in which Lars von Trier has his friend and mentor Jorgen Leth remake one of Leths own films several times with different challenges involved. (Shoot it in Cuba with no set and no shot that lasts longer than 12 frames film it as a cartoon etc.) Writer-director David O. Russell (""The Fighter"" ""I Heart Huckabees"") returns to the big screen with ""Silver Linings Playbook"" and his triumph seems all the more miraculous given a set of obstructions that even von Trier might have found excessively difficult Create a romantic comedy about mental illness that also involves ballroom dancing and pro-football fandom. Make Bradley Cooper act rather than letting him coast on his charm. And get low-key empathetic performances from Robert De Niro (one of the best actors of the last 40 years and one of the worst actors of the last 20) and Chris Tucker. Adapting the novel by Matthew Quick Russell has done all that in an extraordinary balancing act; ""Playbook"" often surprises even as it constantly threatens to run off the rails. ""This shouldnt be working"" I kept thinking to myself along the way ""and yet it does."" If youre looking for a realistic portrayal of bipolar disorder or OCD seek that elsewhere. Characters here are ""crazy"" in the lovable recognizable way of mainstream American cinema but once youve accepted that context theres plenty to enjoy here. Cooper stars as Pat a substitute teacher just getting out of a mental institution after a violent episode involving his wife and her secret lover. Moving back in with his parents Pat Sr. (De Niro) and Dolores (Jacki Weaver) Pat focuses on getting his wife back not letting something as minor as her restraining order get in the way. Pats manic episodes find their counterpart in Pat Sr.s obsessive-compulsive disorder which hes managed to camouflage as extreme fandom for the Philadelphia Eagles. (If someone moves the remote the team will lose) Meanwhile Pats unhappily-married pals (John Ortiz and Julia Stiles) try setting him up with Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a young widow whos had episodes of her own (mostly involving sex with strangers) but is now finding balance in her life through ballroom dancing. You may guess that Pat and Tiffany each spinning around in their own strange orbits come together on the dance floor but their pas de deux is just one of many things going on in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" which also finds room for Dash Mihoks grumpy local cop (whose sole responsibility seems to be turning up whenever Pat is having some kind of public meltdown) and Tucker as Pats fellow inmate with a talent for getting over the wall. Russell pitches the action at a manic screwball pace and the cast is more than up to the task with Cooper and Lawrence attracting and repelling each other with equal dynamism and talented supporting players making these shouting unhappy characters into memorable eccentrics. (Ortizs slow burn as a henpecked husband is particularly potent.) A less talented and less heartfelt filmmaker would have reduced this crew to easily digestible types shied away from their darker behavior and gone for sitcom-level laughs and learning but Russell is too smart for such lazy obstructions. Hes crafted a wonderfully odd ode to dysfunctional people trying to make their way in the world and he knows that their journey would mean nothing without a few black clouds along the way.

But for eternal optimists -- those who see silver linings even in the craziest of situations -- this heartwarming drama about messy families and messy underdogs belongs on your crowded ""must-see"" holiday movie list. True it sticks to a fairly predictable romantic dramedy template but David O. Russells ambidextrous feature comes with prickly edges and insights aplenty as it explores a troubled mans (Cooper) return to his Philadelphia-area home after an eight-month stay in a mental institution.Based on Matthew Quicks novel ""Playbook"" fits comfortably in Russells recent crowd-pleasing canon. Like his Oscar winner ""The Fighter"" from 2010 ""Playbook"" champions scrappy fragile protagonists wrestling with burdensome demons and kooky families. The well-drawn characters -- Russell also wrote the script -- refreshingly avoid saying and doing the perfect things; in essence theyre unapologetically human.That results in meaty roles for the cast and the accomplished actors sink their teeth into the parts. Cooper in particular stands out in part because hes so tremendous but also because he fends off critics who dismiss him as an acting lightweight who coasts on his good looks. As Pat Solitano a bipolar ex-teacher whos come undone due to his cheating wife he renders a character you cant take your eyes off.Advertisement Accurately portraying a mentally ill man requires real care and Cooper not only makes Pat vulnerable and likable but also explores the emotional roller coaster hes on. ""Playbook"" walks a tightrope in how it portrays mental illness -- deriving humor out of its characters actions while demonstrating just how deep-rooted their problems are. Russell balances it well even when the film resorts to more conventional developments near its finale.By then were too hooked to care a credit to Russell and the entire cast. Lawrence (""The Hunger Games"") certainly helps. Shes a commanding force as the fierce and angry Tiffany a brittle young widow branded the town floozy; you can feel her anguish in every scene. She and Cooper have great chemistry and their friendship never seems forced. Robert De Niro turns in one of his best performances of late as Pats dad a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder along with guilt about how its played out in his son. And what a delight it is to see Jacki Weaver an Oscar nominee for the riveting ""Animal Kingdom"" as Pats well-meaning mom Dolores. She never misses a beat. Equally responsible for creating a lasting impression is the production design by Judy Becker. The Solitano home is the real deal from the dark-wood cabinets and dining room table to the drab wallpaper.All these elements distinguish ""Silver Linings Playbook"" as one of the most entertaining gifts from Hollywood so far this season and one that warmly embraces the uniqueness of all of us.Randy Myers is a movie critic and an online producer for the Bay Area Newspaper Group.

Russell in Silver Linings Playbook Wednesday November 14 2012 at 4 a.m. By Karina Longworth 1 A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Silver Linings Playbook which stars Bradley Cooper as a manic-depressive man-child attempting to get his life back together after a breakdown won the coveted Audience Award at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and subsequently shot to the top of most Oscar prognosticators Best Picture short list. The films pre-release embrace is a vindication of the long recovery project of its director David O. Russell who adapted the film from Matthew Quicks novel. Russell is still doing penance for his own manic episode I Heart Huckabees a wonderfully nutty 2004 passion project exploring the desperate search for meaning within corporate America. ""I had a free ticket after [his hit Iraq film] Three Kings so I decided to take a risk"" Russell said upon Huckabees release. ""If this movie makes its money back I will get another ticket.""Huckabees did not earn Russell another ticket and the film he attempted to make after it Nailed was abandoned unfinished. The Oscar-winning The Fighter which Russell was hired to direct by producer/star Mark Wahlberg seemed like Russells announcement that he was through with risk taking that he wanted to work in Hollywood and was willing to subsume his own famously volatile personality into a workmanlike prestige product in order to prove it. In other words after Huckabees proved the pointlessness of fighting against the homogenizing instinct of corporate culture Russell apparently gave in to the system he once struck out against. And while Silver Linings feels somewhat more personal than The Fighter it also feels like the movie version of a brilliant but unbalanced mind on too many edge-sanding meds.Released from the psych hospital where he was sent after a spectacular marriage-ending manic fit Pat Solitano (Cooper) moves back into his childhood home in drab suburban Philly. Between mandated therapy sessions he works on both body (jogging around the neighborhood wearing a garbage bag over his sweats) and mind (reading the books his ex-wife Nikki teaches to high school English students). A Farewell to Arms triggers a blowup--Pat cant handle the unhappy ending. ""I will apologize on behalf of Ernest Hemingway"" he tells his father after breaking a window. ""Thats whos to blame here.""Film Details Silver Linings Playbook RatingR GenreComedy Running Time120 More Info Cooper spits out such lines in an unmodulated rapid-fire assault his eyes wide and shining. Russell trusts us to draw on like every movie weve ever seen to recognize this is what the fearlessness of the mad looks and sounds like; the twist is that Pats parents--Eagles-superfan-turned-superstitious-amateur-bookie Pat Senior (Robert De Niro) and the sweetly overbearing Dolores (Jacki Weaver)--speak the same way. The scenes set in the Solitano home are a cacophony of mile-a-minute monotone a high-wire feat of hyperactive ensemble acting. Theyre the best most alive parts of the movie.Pat subscribes to a philosophy of positive thinking which he apparently picked up while in the mental ward a coping mechanism encouraging a relentless optimism that amounts to a willful distortion of reality. Like many crazy people and assholes Pat brands himself a ""truth teller"" in a world full of phonies; he is of course the only person who cant see the truth about himself which is that hes incapable of empathy. Whether he knows it or not what hes really working toward is learning how to break through the blinders of his own emotions and become cognizant of the feelings of other people. It comes as no surprise that the vehicle for this transformation is a slow-building romance between Pat and Tiffany a depressed bruised young widow played with feisty authenticity by Jennifer Lawrence. Tiffany vaguely knows Nikki and after a few awkward false starts of flirtation/stalking she suckers Pat into agreeing to be her partner in a dance competition in exchange for helping him get in touch with his ex restraining order be damned.Are these two incredibly attractive well-meaning eccentrics victims of an overreactive age of knee-jerk overmedication? Or are they really clinically looney tunes? Silver Linings doesnt seem to care. Pat and Tiffanys common damage only matters insofar as it gives each of them a need to find understanding and healing in the other. Anything reflecting the long-term reality of living with mental illness--particularly the fact that love is its own kind of mania more likely to inspire mood swings than cure them--would get in the way of the happy ending that the film has broadcast all along.Russell shows his affinity for the bipolar spirit by radically shifting tones and mashing up aesthetics an approach mirrored by the dance Lawrence and Cooper perform at the end a medley of songs and styles that come together in a fractured charmingly messy whole. Silver Linings Playbook is shot with the same visual shorthand for ""real"" Russell employed on The Fighter but the new film is obstinately escapist. The crackling organic feeling conjured by the fine ensemble is dulled by Tiffanys habit of speechifying subtext (telling Pat hes ""scared to be alive"" summing up herself by admitting ""Theres always gonna be a part of me thats sloppy and dirty but I like that"") and contrasted by an internal logic thats distinctly classic small-town screwball. The film begins around Halloween and spans Thanksgiving and Christmas allowing Pats arc to play out against a backdrop of holiday iconography evocative of deep American sentimental myth shit. Silver Linings is a ""gritty"" depiction of broken people trying to get it together; its also a fairy tale.Manic as it might be stylistically emotionally Silver Linings Playbook maintains too even of a keel. Its a film about the alienated that makes sure to alienate no one a movie depicting wild mood extremes that never rises or falls above a dull hum of diversion never exploding into riotous comedy or daring to be devastatingly sad. Its chaos is always tightly controlled. Russell has made a great movie about American malaise; this isnt it.

They might as well tattoo  Nominate me for Best Actor pretty please on their foreheads. In David O Russells new comedy two of Hollywoods new favourite actors Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence (hes the alpha-guy in The Hangover shes devil-tough Katniss in The Hunger Games) have recently suffered breakdowns. Oh and they bond via the medium of modern dance. Sounds like a textbook case of actors rattling the worthy tin for prizes? Funnily enough not this time. The Silver Linings Playbook zips along on its off-beat energy and fast-paced wisecracking script. Its undemanding but funny honest even about mental health without being patronising (most of the time) and best of all its brilliantly acted.After a nasty incident involving his ex-wifes lover and a bi-polar diagnosis Pat Solitano (Cooper) has spent eight months on a psychiatric ward. Back at home living with his folks hes convinced that his ex is waiting for him to get better (in spite of that restraining order). In Pats house American football is a religion. His dad (Robert DeNiro gilding the lily) is an illegal bookie whos borderline obsessive and has anger issues. Pats long-suffering mum (played by the incredible Jacki Weaver - watch her in little-seen Aussie gem Animal Kingdom) holds the family together with her warmth and homebaking. This world isnt a million miles from Russells last film The Fighter - ordinary America. And the Solitano household reminded me of that old line about home being the only place where they have to take you in. Anyone whos lived with someone with mental illness will recognise this dysfunctional bunch - how much weirdness a family will live with and swallow (Oh thats just dad dont mess his remote controls). When Pat meets Tiffany (Lawrence) and discovers that shes friends with his ex-wife he agrees to be her dance partner in a local talent competition - if she passes a note to his ex. In an oddly touching scene the pair bond over prescription drugs (they just take the light out of your eyes dont they). Tiffany has problems of her own. Since her husbands death she has become a sex addict. Yes that sounds phony - its one of a few bum notes (another is an unfunny Indian psychiatrist). But Pat and Tiffanys love/hate relationship is a treat to watch - all sparring banter loose-lipped and without boundaries. The acting is sparky and intelligent with Cooper proving theres more to him than flashy good looks. As for Lawrence she acts every role like theres a soulful storm raging inside of her. If awards glory comes the way of this pair it will be deserved.

We know that they are made because he wears a bin bag and she has sex. And they shout. Almost all the dialogue is shouting. Which doesnt make it any more interesting or convincing. Just louder.

I can only add that this was a great Christmas watch and yet another top notch American Indie. For me all the cast acted their socks off with Lawrences performance the top of the (Christmas) tree. Yes you have to go with it in many ways but like Robert and Jo above I was happy to because SLPs key message that to ""madly"" live life without fear is better than hiding conforming and not living at all was conveyed so well and with great humour.

It starts slowly but only really gets to full speed when Lawrence is on screen. She is superb but what drags the film back is Coopers somewhat two dimensional performance. De Niro and Weaver give excellent support and Tucker manages just to keep things in check. You can see the ending some way from the end but that does little to reduce its impact. De Niros final father son pep talk sets the scene for a conventional but still moving ending. Its very good but not quite brilliant. Like the Hunger Games Lawrence dominates a flawed film.

Jennifer Lawrence also gives us more of her promising talent auspiciously seen in ""Winters Bone"" instead of being overshadowed by the ""Hunger Games"" nonsense. Russell gives a slice of suburban America as he did with ""The Fighter"" and presents us a slice of the fractured perfect family with Robert De Niros Pat (back on form sir) trying to reconnect with his son. With a somewhat conventional ending this film is a surprisingly entertaining movie that doesnt deal with mental illness in a heavy handed tactile fashion.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyShow More Share Tweet 0 Shares Top About us Work for Time Out Privacy policy Cookie Policy Website terms of use Contact us Time Out for business Get listed Claim your listing Premium Profiles Advertising Time Out products Time Out Card Mobile apps Time Out Shop Time Out Guides Time Out Travel Time Out Offers Time Out Worldwide Time Out magazine Where to get Time Out magazine Subscribe to Time Out magazine Manage my subscription Follow us Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Pinterest Spotify Time Out London Site map }",http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/93407/the-silver-linings-playbook.html,200,silverliningsplaybook37,silverliningsplaybook,timeout

Its not enough that he was confined to a mental institution after catching his wife with another man and nearly beating the guy to death. Now this turbulently bipolar blunderer is emerging from his time away with no job no house (back to Mom and Dad he goes) and pariah status among everyone except the really cute emotionally disturbed girl next door (Jennifer Lawrence). Sounds like a recipe for a bad ol Indiewood melodrama right? But the primary pleasure of this black romantic comedy adapted by writer-director David O. Russell from Matthew Quicks novel is how jagged-edged everything is with a stellar group of actors spouting overlapping acid-tongued dialogue like their lives depended on it. This shouldnt be surprising for those familiar with Russells singular cinema-of-hysteria Beginning with his incest-farce feature debut Spanking the Monkey (1994) the filmmaker has created a uniquely discomfiting body of work that explores distinctly American neuroses with bracing specificity and frequent hilarity. In its best scenes Silver Linings plays like a greatest-hits compilation. Coopers baby-faced protagonist has a nerve-jangled family--led by football-obsessed patriarch Robert De Niro--that echoes the too-close-for-comfort Coplin clan from Russells Flirting with Disaster (1996). And characters frequently hold forth with pointedly satirical psychobabble that wouldnt be out of place in the directors caustic I Heart Huckabees (2004). Russells dissonant narrative left-turns are also prevalent; what other gray-cloud romance contains both frighteningly realistic familial outbursts and a jokey amateur dance competition? Yet its impossible to shake the sense that what felt thrillingly cohesively alive in the directors earlier movies plays here with more laurel-resting creakiness than go-for-broke verve. Russells once-mercurial assets have become a formula.

"Silver Linings Playbook | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; silver-linings-playbook ) Silver Linings Playbook (United States 2012) November 13 2012 A movie review by James Berardinelli Silver Linings Playbook is a quirky adult romantic comedy that goes beyond the standard rhythms of the genre. Although this is a funny movie theres an edge to the humor not unlike what we have become accustomed to in the work of Alexander Payne. The director is David O. Russell whos as mercurial a filmmaker as one is likely to find; his films are unique entities. To the extent that Silver Linings Playbook shares traits with another of Russells productions Flirting with Disaster comes to mind more readily than 2010s The Fighter. Ultimately this is an engaging uplifting and life-affirming motion picture that reminds viewers that it is possible to do interesting things with a romantic comedy while still sticking to some of the conventions. As unlikely as it might sound Silver Linings Playbook uses mental illness as a catalyst for romance. For the most part the main characters bipolar disorder is treated with respect - it is neither overblown nor used as fodder for juvenile humor. For about 2/3 of the running length Silver Linings Playbook is about a character coping with this on a daily basis taking or rejecting his meds (because he feels ""clearer"" without them) opening up to his therapist or opting to stay closed coping with his triggers trying to avoid getting too high or too low. As the movie opens Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) is just getting out of a hospital where he has been confined for the past eight months. Now he must find a way to avoid going back. And its not easy. His driving ambition is to reunite with his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) whose infidelity led to the breakdown that resulted in him being institutionalized. She has taken out a restraining order which prevents him from actively hunting her down but hes not above using a little subterfuge. Thats where Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) comes in. She has mental problems of her own (theres a funny scene in which they discuss the relative merits of various medications) but is a possible conduit to Nikki. She agrees to deliver a letter in return for a favor - in order to enter a dance competition she needs a partner. Meanwhile Pat tries to re-engage with his sympathetic mother (Jacki Weaver) and gruff father (Robert DeNiro). The latter is a die-hard Philadelphia Eagles fan and wants to bond with his son by watching games with him - something that holds little interest for Pat. As he bulldozes ahead with singleminded determination he fails to realize how worried his parents are about him and that Tiffany harbors feelings deeper than friendship. If theres a criticism to be leveled at Silver Linings Playbook its that the mental illness elements recede into the background during the final half-hour to allow things to progress as a more conventional romantic comedy. The transition isnt jarring or necessarily unwelcome especially when one considers the strong chemistry evident between Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence - these two crackle with energy - but there is a sense that potentially more intriguing ground may have gone unplowed. Over the past few years Cooper has raised his profile considerably (due in large part to The Hangover) but this is a rare ""straight"" portrayal. The movie is a comedy but the character is grounded. Lawrence despite retaining the dark hair from The Hunger Games requires less than a minute to get us to forget about Katniss. She and Cooper are about as well-matched as a screen couple can be; those who appreciate their chemistry can re-visit it next year when they co-star as husband and wife in Serena. Robert DeNiro perhaps having finally realized its possible to be in a comedy and not make a fool out of himself reminds us of why he was once considered among the greatest actors of his generation before Billy Crystal Bullwinkle and the Fockers turned him into a laughingstock. Im a sucker for a good romantic comedy and this is the best Ive seen in some time. The characters feel more earthy and passionate and the fairy tale elements are dialed back. The film ends predictably but there are times when the path to get there isnt obvious. The narrative is more substantial than we expect from entries into this genre and the humor is organic to the experience not a series of tacked-on jokes. The best romantic comedies have three ingredients well-developed characters strong chemistry between the leads and an interesting storyline to propel their relationship along. Silver Linings Playbook lacks none of these and as a result it will likely appeal to critics general movie-goers and perhaps the Academy.

Russells first movie since the Oscar-bait crowd-pleaser The Fighter Silver Linings Playbook is a neurotic ode to family dysfunction and accepting the universal screwup in all of us which is to say its maybe the most heartwarming movie youll ever see about bipolarity. After several months of being deinstitutionalized Pat (Bradley Cooper) is determined to prove to his estranged wife that hes perfectly - no really - okay. But hes not and in fact is so not okay he cant even recognize that the attention hes getting from the equally dysfunctional Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) may be the nicest thing thats ever happened to him. Russells clear affection for his hopelessly oblivious characters is palpable and genuine Lawrence and Cooper have electric chemistry and the director pulls off one of the most satisfying romantic Hollywood endings seen in years.

Russells Funniest Film to Date Eric Kohn Sep 9 2012 238 pm erickohn Share This Article Pin It Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Print Talk David O. Russells movies have always been lively affairs but none maintain the same fluid comedic inspiration of ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Adapting Matthew Quicks novel both as solo screenwriter and director Russell assembles a small bubbly cast for an unexpectedly charming romcom that frequently dances -- at one point quite literally -- between cynicism and bittersweetness with largely winning results. For its soul-searching trajectory the new work has a kinship with Russells ""I Heart Huckabees"" although its also a natural follow-up to ""The Fighter"" in that it creates a stirring effect that calls to mind the crowdpleasing rhythms of a sports movie. As disgraced former substitute teacher Pat (Bradley Cooper) attempts to piece his life together in the wake of a mental breakdown ""Silver Linings Playbook"" smartly engages with his legitimate dramas while infusing them with an upbeat spirit akin to the inspiration he seeks. Having caught his wife (essentially a non-character for the duration of the movie) in the shower with another teacher Pat gets shipped away for mental help. Before the story begins he has been forced into psychiatric care; when his mother (Jacki Weaver) picks him up and returns him to their Philadelphia home he still has plenty of baggage to work out. A timebomb not unlike the drug-addicted anti-hero played by Anne Hathaway in ""Rachel Getting Married"" Pat faces uncertainty from every direction. Diagnosed as bipolar he cant figure out whether he should pine for his wifes affections or respect the restraining order she has issued against him but advice comes his way from virtually everyone he knows His shrink (Anupam Kher) encourages him to seek new romantic opportunities while his mopey father (Robert De Niro) grouses about Pats naivete. In his better moments Pat tries to be an idealist (hence the title) but cant find the right path to realize his optimistic aspirations. Potential catharsis arrives when an old friend (John Ortiz) invites Pat over to dinner. There he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a fellow manic depressive whose breakdown involved a series of promiscuous acts in the wake of her husbands untimely death. Buried in goth makeup and dark hair Lawrence delivers a charged feisty turn that stands apart from her typically low key performances. Foul-mouthed and prone to loud unwieldy tantrums her character is a terrific embodiment of the energy Pat needs to chart a solution to his dilemma. After a few terse exchanges and mild flirtations that go hilariously wrong Pat makes a deal with the limber Tiffany Hell perform as her partner in a dance competition if she helps him get back in touch with his wife. It should come as no great surprise that the time the two spend together results in a burgeoning attraction that complicates the matters at hand. But Russell directs the proceedings using a fluid approach that never indulges in rote sentimentalism without keeping the wit in check as well. Relying on close-ups and two shots that draw out the nuances of dialogue and performances Russell gets so close to his actors that he maintains a near-theatrical sense of containment even when the action flares up. The dynamic scene in which Tiffany and Pats family simultaneously confront him about his shortcomings finds nearly the entire ensemble yelling at each other. American comedy is rarely so intense without turning dark. Instead ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is incredibly heartfelt to a large degree because of its cast. Alongside Lawrence De Niro stands out with a surprisingly effective turn as a middle-aged loser with good intentions that represents his best role in years. Unlike his other comedic performances his deadpan delivery never devolves into schtick. The only gimmicky turn comes from Chris Tucker as Pats effusive pal from the looney bin from which he keeps escaping but he never feels out of sync with Russells commitment to keepings the atmosphere light even as Pats emotional trauma rings true. Turning frantic relationship problems into breezy entertainment Russell gives ""Silver Linings Playbook"" the air of a classic romcom strengthening it with the type of sophisticated insight into human behavior that Preston Sturges might make today. While the thrilling climax involves an absurd bet and rounds things up a little too neatly Russell never simplifies the shared neuroses that enable Pat and Tiffany to form an unlikely bond. ""You are afraid to be alive"" she tells him clearly speaking from experience. The line aptly sums up the appeal of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" a movie that explores the fear of overcoming challenges by making it possible to laugh at them. Criticwire grade A- HOW WILL IT PLAY? The Weinstein Company releases ""Silver Linings Playbook"" on November 21. Given the positive Toronto reception and the timing of the release it is likely to remain an awards season contender for all major castmembers; Russell is also a definite contender for his screenplay. Good reviews should help propel it to a decent reception in limited release. David O. Russells movies have always been lively affairs but none maintain the same fluid comedic inspiration of ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Adapting Matthew Quicks novel both as solo screenwriter and director Russell assembles a small bubbly cast for an unexpectedly charming romcom that frequently dances -- at one point quite literally -- between cynicism and bittersweetness with largely winning results. For its soul-searching trajectory the new work has a kinship with Russells ""I Heart Huckabees"" although its also a natural follow-up to ""The Fighter"" in that it creates a stirring effect that calls to mind the crowdpleasing rhythms of a sports movie. As disgraced former substitute teacher Pat (Bradley Cooper) attempts to piece his life together in the wake of a mental breakdown ""Silver Linings Playbook"" smartly engages with his legitimate dramas while infusing them with a bubbly spirit akin to the inspiration he seeks. Having caught his wife (essentially a non-character for the duration of the movie) in the shower with another teacher Pat gets shipped away for mental help. Before the story begins he has been forced into psychiatric care; when his mother (Jacki Weaver) picks him up and returns him to their Philadelphia home he still has plenty of baggage to work out. A timebomb not unlike the drug-addicted anti-hero played by Anne Hathaway in ""Rachel Getting Married"" Pat faces uncertainty from every direction. Diagnosed as bipolar he cant figure out whether he should pine for his wifes affections or respect the restraining order she has issued against him but advice comes his way from virtually everyone he knows His shrink (Anupam Kher) encourages him to seek new romantic opportunities while his mopey father (Robert De Niro) grouses about Pats naivete. In his better moments Pat tries to be an idealist (hence the title) but cant find the right path to realize his optimistic aspirations. Potential catharsis arrives when an old friend (John Ortiz) invites Pat over to dinner. There he meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) a fellow manic depressive whose breakdown involved a series of promiscuous acts in the wake of her husbands untimely death. Buried in goth makeup and dark hair Lawrence delivers a charged feisty turn that stands apart from her typically low key performances. Foul-mouthed and prone to loud unwieldy tantrums her character is a terrific embodiment of the energy Pat needs to chart a solution to his dilemma. After a few terse exchanges and mild flirtations that go hilariously wrong Pat makes a deal with the limber Tiffany Hell perform as her partner in a dance competition if she helps him get back in touch with his wife. It should come as no great surprise that the time the two spend together results in a burgeoning attraction that complicates the matters at hand. But Russell directs the proceedings using a fluid approach that never indulges in rote sentimentalism without keeping the wit in check as well. Relying on close-ups and two shots that draw out the nuances of dialogue and performances Russell gets so close to his actors that he maintains a near-theatrical sense of containment even when the action flares up. The dynamic scene in which Tiffany and Pats family simultaneously confront him about his shortcomings finds nearly the entire ensemble yelling at each other. American comedy is rarely so intense without turning dark. Instead ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is incredibly heartfelt to a large degree because of its cast. Alongside Lawrence De Niro stands out with a surprisingly effective turn as a middle-aged loser with good intentions that represents his best role in years. Unlike his other comedic performances his deadpan delivery never devolves into schtick. The only gimmicky turn comes from Chris Tucker as Pats effusive pal from the looney bin from which he keeps escaping but he never feels out of sync with Russells commitment to keepings the atmosphere light even as Pats emotional trauma rings true. Turning frantic relationship problems into breezy entertainment Russell gives ""Silver Linings Playbook"" the air of a classic romcom strengthening it with the type of sophisticated insight into human behavior that Preston Sturges might make today.

Slideshow A wonderful Silver Linings Playbook to open Philadelphia Film Festival Advertisment of Gallery Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon More about Silver Linings Playbook >> Theyre trying to shed weight these two. Not physical weight (although Coopers character complains his meds are making him fat) but the burdens theyre carrying around in their heads. Pat Solitano (Cooper in an amazingly fierce funny performance) and his uninvited tagalong Tiffany are damaged souls. A head-spinning wonder of a movie about love and pain reclamation and the totemic power of a National Football League franchise Silver Linings Playbook opens the Philadelphia Film Festival on Thursday night and opens in theaters a month from now. It is without doubt a transcendent endeavor from its exhilaratingly smart screenplay - director David O. Russells adaptation of the novel by former South Jersey teacher Matthew Quick - to the unexpected and moving turns of its two leads. And by everybody else (Robert De Niro Jacki Weaver Chris Tucker Anupam Kher) in its remarkable cast. Its funny its tragic it dives into a world wholly recognizable (doubly so for Philly natives who have trod the same sidewalks supped at the same diners sported the same DeSean Jackson jerseys) and it springs from a great Hollywood tradition - the storm-tossed romantic comedy. Boy meets girl boy and girl are separated by momentous conflict boy and girl overcome obstacles to get together and live happily ever after . . . or do they? Pat Solitano is a high school English teacher who in the opening of Silver Linings Playbook is just out from eight months in a Baltimore psych ward. He found his wife with another guy he lost it - and then he lost his job. So its home to his parents house in Ridley Park - Pat Sr. (De Niro doing his best work in years) and Dolores (Weaver) a couple whose world turns on Andy Reid and the Philadelphia Eagles. On game days Pat Sr. sits at the TV (hes barred from attending the games; thats another story) his Eagles kerchief folded just so wearing his Eagles sweater betting big money on his team. Eagles fever has rubbed off on his son - how could it not? So has a certain manic temperament. Pat Jr. diagnosed with bipolar disorder reports to his therapists office (the wonderfully wry Kher) hears Stevie Wonder crooning ""My Cherie Amour"" and goes ballistic. That was their song - Pat and his wife Nikki. And now hes got a restraining order - he cant even see her. The song is a ""trigger."" There are plenty of others. And then at a dinner Pat meets Tiffany. She too can rattle off a list of name-brand SSRIs and their respective nuances. She like Pat is functioning (just) - and functioning without filters. Shell say whats on her mind no matter how wildly inappropriate or impolitic. Pat and Tiffany seem destined for each other - except that Pat wants nothing more than to reconcile with Nikki the love of his life. And Tiffany has her own issues Shes a young widow she suffers from depression and low self-esteem she sleeps around. And so the courtship begins. Russell surveyed the crazy tumult of another fractious family in The Fighter and he excels at wrangling large casts into tight propulsive story lines (I Huckabees Three Kings). The dialogue here ricochets. The emotions hit you sideways. On a Halloween date over raisin bran and tea (how romantic) Pat and Tiffany take brutal shots at each other. Their hurt and longing are palpable a common bond they refuse to acknowledge. By the time she has persuaded him to be her partner in a dance competition and theyre at her place rehearsing moves to the croon of Bob Dylan were completely on their side. These two wackos need each other and we need them to realize that fact. In Winters Bone the film that first brought her acclaim Lawrence showed the instincts of a fine actor - she could project inner fire and vulnerability without overselling things. But her performance in Silver Linings Playbook is a revelation nonetheless - she takes this broken woman and brings her to life with wit and grace and deep dark currents of heartache. Cooper and Lawrence together are well awesome. So is Silver Linings Playbook. Silver Linings Playbook  (out of four stars) Directed by David O. Russell.

Life is dance life is a game and ""Silver Linings Playbook"" sweeps both apt metaphors up into its broad cowl and presents them back to you smirk firmly affixed. Its a special film this one the sort we wait for all year the kind that reaffirms our belief in talented people working together toward an artistic goal. With great pacing a great sense of the moment and some of the most entertaining one-liners youll find this side of a Coen brothers film theres much to like about ""Silver Linings Playbook."" You probably have a friendship or two in your life you find yourself a bit apprehensive about the sort of relationship where your guard is always slightly raised. Perhaps your buddy once pulled a knife in a bar or maybe a pal has told you about a constant struggle with mental illness -- whatever the case you find it difficult to completely relax when youre in the persons company. This is largely the structure of ""Silver Linings Playbook"" a film that deals with emotional trauma as well as weve seen in quite some time and in a more realistic manner than ""A Beautiful Mind"" or ""Take Shelter."" Its not always a laugh riot and its not always clean but the film makes its mark by creating a world that doesnt feel artificial. These are the people in your neighborhood folks youve met and so connecting with them as characters is almost automatic. Little details help build texture -- a fascination with Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver DeSean Jackson a gambling compulsion sibling rivalry a dinner where patrons sometimes order cereal to ensure they arent on ""a date."" Once youve added all these moments up youre bound to come up with a good score for ""Silver Linings Playbook"" though we owe it to the world at large to hint at a few plot points while were exploring the studio space. Also Check Out Stars Take the Red Carpet at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival Pat Solitano (Bradley Cooper) has just been released from a mental institution. Hes battling a gambit of psychosis and no one is at all certain which version of Pat will be coming home to live with his parents. For his part Pat harbors extreme delusions about the direction his life is going to take after his confinement. Hes been taught the power of positive thinking only hes slightly misheard the message. To wit instead of using his ""silver linings"" philosophy to roll with the punches hes decided his new lease on life guarantees him whatever he sets his mind to including his highly estranged wife who has a restraining order against him. Pat moves back in with his mom and dad both of whom have their own stuff going on and tries to re-insert himself into the community at large with massively mixed results. His friends decide to introduce him to another disaster of a human Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence) who has recently lost someone close to her -- shes become the female version of Pat though with a far less positive outlook. Pat and Tiffanys pals set them up on a date as if they were both feral cats just deciding to huck them together in a bag and hope for the best. This goes about the way youd expect with plenty of claws and teeth-gnashing. When it comes to portraying emotionally damaged people onscreen -- a film like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" comes to mind -- its rarely equally balanced. Generally someone is saving someone else or someone realizes their damage was just them needing to grow up. Bi-polar and ""Im off my meds"" type of emotional problems? This gives Hollywood pause. A female protagonist that has something less than squeaky clean sexual proclivities? In a drama? Again not a topic youre going to find out there very often given the skittishness of our culture vis a vis sex. But hey guys heres ""Silver Linings Playbook"" from director David O. Russell (""The Fighter"" ""I Heart Huckabees"" ""Three Kings"") delivering on every level. The performances in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" are also exceptional. Bradley Cooper is easily the best hes ever been as is Chris Tucker as Pats friend Danny. Robert De Niro does a fine job as Pats father; he hasnt been this solid since ""Stardust."" Jennifer Lawrence (""The Hunger Games"" ""Like Crazy"" ""Winters Bone"") is once again tremendous and she commands each and every scene shes in. However the highest level of kudos must be reserved for director David O. Russell who adapted this work from Matthew Quicks novel of the same name. Russells steady direction does evoke memories of Best Picture nominee ""The Fighter"" though this is a far less visual experience. Still ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a genuine keeper a film to catch in theaters the dancing game of life placed on a pretty pedestal for all the world to see.

Russells modest indie romcom offers nothing original but the chance to spend a couple hours in the hating-then-loving company of two engaging stars By Richard Corliss Sept. 11 2012 Share Read Later The Weinstein Company Silver Linings Playbook Year 2012 Director David O. Russell Studio The Weinstein Company Actors Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture For some movies a film festival spotlight can feel like a third-degree burn. A picture of modest virtues like David O. Russells Silver Linings Playbook may trip on the red carpet and wilt in the heat of a Saturday evening screening at the cavernous Roy Thomson Hall. But the Toronto Film Festival revels in celebrity and this intimate indie romcom happens to be headlined by the stars of the biggest comedy hit of the past few years and the all-time top-grossing female-oriented action film. So if Bradley Cooper doesnt mind sharing his Hangover luster and Jennifer Lawrence her Hunger Games eclat -- throw in Robert De Niro too since he plays Coopers dad -- then a movie that would be more appropriate in a lower Manhattan art house will get the megawatt TIFF treatment. Russell built his indie rep on two kinda-comedies Spanking the Monkey and Flirting With Disaster that placed the modern American family in the middle of Dysfunction Junction and watched with satire and some sympathy as crises whizzed past imperiling all standing there but never quite killing them. After Three Kings and I Heart Huckabees he returned to his fractured-family theme with The Fighter a true-life Sports Inspirational movie that often played like acute high-volume farce. Mom (Melissa Leo) and one of the kids (Christian Bale) were wildly unstable but everyone loved everyone else. The Motion Picture Academy loved them too; both actors won Oscars. (READ Corlisss review of David O. Russells The Fighter) Silver Linings Playbook Matthew Quicks 2008 novel is so fond of the neurotics in its pages that it might have been written as a spec script for Russell. The father Pat Solitano a bookie with dreams of opening a cheesesteak restaurant has been banned from attending games of his beloved Philadelphia Eagles because hes picked too many fights with other fans. His son Pat Jr. a former high school teacher is certifiably nuts -- he has a four-year stay in an asylum to prove it for assaulting a fellow teacher whom he found screwing Pats wife Nikki in the shower -- and on his release believes he can reconcile with Nikki if he just shapes up and stays positive. This is a long shot like the Eagles winning the Super Bowl ever. (They got there twice in 1981 and 2005; lost both times.) Pat Jr. should pay more attention to the young woman Tiffany who has acquired a reputation as an easy lay in her depression after her policeman husband died. Tiffany would be a perfect addition to the Solitano family. (READ Belinda Luscombe on the early David O. Russell movies by subscribing to TIME) So the Quick book is now a Russell movie with De Niro as Pat Sr. Cooper as Pat Jr. and Lawrence as Tiffany. All that star power may have made the writer-director averse to experiment for Silver Linings Playbook is his most timid and conventional feature. Its the kind of movie where a character does something obvious for the first hour (like Pat Sr.s attempts to get close to his son by begging him to watch Eagles games with him) and then in the second hour explains the obvious (to quote loosely ""I begged you to watch the games with me so I could get close to you""). Its also another movie set in Philadelphia -- actually Ridley Park just across the city line -- where nobody even tries to speak in the areas distinct nasal twang. Finally this is a story so deeply comfortable with narrative cliches that it climaxes with... a dance contest. Will Pat and Tiffany bond as they practice for their big night? Will they earn a high enough score to keep Pat Sr. who has bet his savings on the outcome from going broke? Will the sun rise tomorrow over Ben Franklins statue at the top of City Hall? (READ Mary Pols on Bradley Cooper in The Hangover Part II) One last question Then why go? To see some big-time actors make themselves at home in this ramshackle structure. Cooper has exactly the ferocious drive that may have put Pat Jr. away for a while plus a humane wit that gives Pat Jr. the potential to grow out of his illness. De Niro -- no longer the raging bull now the Focker father-in-law -- squints and screams and sighs with an exasperation that may reflect his current career status but which also suits the personality of a man concerned that his own anger-management issues may have bloomed even more dangerously in his son. Jacki Weaver the Australian actress Oscar-nominated as the killer mom in Animal Kingdom is the civilizing influence in the Solitano home Marge Simpson to Pat Sr.s Homer. And Chris Tucker the ingratiating countertenor comic from Jackie Brown and the Rush Hour movies brightens the screen whenever he shows up as one of Pat Jr.s friends from the asylum; its Tuckers first non-Jackie Chan film in 15 years. (READ Corliss on Chris Tucker in the Rush Hour movies) The performances of these actors are reason enough to go. The reason to stay is Lawrence. Just 21 when the movie was shot Lawrence is that rare young actress who plays who is grown-up. Sullen and sultry she lends a mature intelligence to any role whether as the one sane person in Winters Bone or as Raven (Mystique) in X-Men First Class. Her Tiffany at first seems more dangerous than Pat Jr.; she stalks him on his morning jogs and says of herself ""Im just the crazy slut with the dead husband."" But Tiffany has the ability to thaw -- slowly without renouncing her principles or her gravity -- and by luring Pat Jr. into that ridiculous dance contest to give his life a purpose other than his daft scheme of reconciling with Nikki. She is clearly Pat Jr.s salvation just as Jennifer Lawrence is the silver lining is this mostly ordinary playbook.

Russells winning comedy romance about two people struggling to rebuild their lives. TWITTER Writer-director David O. Russells return to comedy features an ace ensemble cast that includes Bradley Cooper Jennifer Lawrence Robert De Niro Jacki Weaver and Chris Tucker. TORONTO -- While David O. Russells foray into conventional drama with The Fighter was a richly satisfying knockout its a joy to see him back in the off-kilter comedy realm with the wonderful Silver Linings Playbook. Cheerfully yet poignantly exposing the struggles anxieties disorders and obsessions of ordinary people this is a film as odd as it is charming. It brings out the best in a superlative cast led by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence both showing unexpected colors. Adapted by Russell from Matthew Quicks well-received 2008 novel the comedy in many ways recalls the directors early brush with a screwy family Flirting With Disaster. And Pat Solatano (Cooper) is a similarly driven central character to the one played by Ben Stiller in that 1996 film just quite a bit more unstable. Theres a degree of dysfunction in almost all the characters here but this comes off as the affectionately observed foibles of real people not calculated movie eccentricities. THR COVER Bradley Cooper The Serious Evolution of a Leading Man A longtime sufferer of undiagnosed bipolar disorder former high school teacher Pat has spent eight months in a psychiatric facility on a plea bargain after a violent incident when he surprised his wife Nikki (Brea Bee) having sex with their co-worker. Released into the care of his parents Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro) and Dolores (Jacki Weaver) he is determined to put his newfound hospital wisdom into practice. ""Im remaking myself"" he says vowing to find the silver lining in every situation. Pat remains convinced this is the way to win back Nikki who has filed a restraining order against him. Initial signs are not promising however as Pat reacts badly to the trigger of their wedding song (Stevie Wonder doing ""My Cherie Amour"") and gets manic as he tears up the house looking for their nuptials video. In the most hilarious of the early scenes as hes reading Nikkis teaching syllabus to be supportive he wakes his parents at 4 a.m. to rant about Ernest Hemingways refusal to end A Farewell to Arms on a happy note. Cooper gives filter-free Pat a desperation thats both painful and funny asserting his positivity and growth while at the same time emitting alarm signals. The actors work becomes even more appealing once Lawrence enters the picture as Tiffany. A young widow depressed since the death of her cop husband -- and possibly before -- shes every bit as volatile and blunt as Pat and also tainted by her own dark meltdown. Given the quirkiness of the humor the pathos slowly generated by these characters is unexpected. The chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence makes them a delight to watch their spiky rapport failing to conceal a mutual attraction. PHOTOS Bradley Cooper A Day in the Life in Pictures Remaining stubbornly fixated on the absent Nikki Pat ropes Tiffany into helping open communication channels by delivering a letter. In exchange Tiffany insists that he partner her in a dance competition requiring long rehearsal sessions in her garage studio. The loveliest of these scenes is set to the melancholy waltz strains of ""Girl From the North Country"" sung by Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash which typifies Russells idiosyncratic music choices. Working with cinematographer Masanobu Takayanagi and editors Jay Cassidy and Crispin Struthers Russell gives the comedy an invigorating messiness. The action is shot and cut with the same nervous energy that hard-wires the two central characters. Its no mystery where their relationship is headed even with all the clashes and mutual disappointments. But the crazy ways the film gets there feel fresh. Russell is working in an absurd comedy-of-awkwardness vein but he captures genuine vulnerability in his characters and their various degrees of imbalance. This pertains in particular to Pats father who shows that the apple doesnt fall far from the tree. Having lost his job and his pension Pat Sr. runs a small betting operation which he hopes will finance a cheesesteak joint. His love for his home football team the Philadelphia Eagles is a consuming passion fueled by distinct OCD traits and governed by superstitions. Given that his father has been banned from the stadium for repeatedly starting fights Pat wonders in therapy why his single violent episode is considered so much worse. VIDEO Behind the Scenes of THRs Bradley Cooper Cover Shoot Pat Sr. is a gem of a role and De Niro hasnt been this alive and emotionally engaged onscreen in years. A scene in which he melts while conceding to Pat that he might not have been the most nurturing parent is an extremely touching moment. Australian actress Weaver (Animal Kingdom) is daffy and warm as Pats salt-of-the-earth mother who frets about her son being able to keep it together. One of the chief pleasures here is the incisive work of actors in even the smallest roles. As Pats best friend Ronnie John Ortiz bristles with the stress of home job baby and controlling wife in Tiffanys sister played with cool command by Julia Stiles. Indian veteran Anupam Kher brings a nice needling manner to Pats therapist whos also a mad Eagles fan. And Chris Tucker drops in now and then as a nutty pal from the clinic who seems quite comfortable with his tics. But while the entire ensemble is sharp their work would be nothing without two such deftly anchoring lead performances to bounce off. Cooper brings enormous heart to a role that easily might have veered toward the abrasive and Lawrence shows off natural comic chops that we havent seen much from her. Theres self-exposure and risk in both these actors work here which makes for rewarding comedy. Venue Toronto Film Festival (Gala; The Weinstein Co.) Production The Weinstein Co.

Never one to shy away from unlikely sources of comedy David O. Russell tackles mental illness marital failure and the curative powers of football with bracingly sharp and satisfying results in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Again bringing an invigorating edge to whip-smart mainstream fare a la ""The Fighter"" the writer-director employs a twitchy visual syntax to match the dazzling verbal acumen of his two screw-loose leads terrifically played by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. Strong reviews and word of mouth should make this boisterous and heartfelt loser love story a year-end winner for the Weinstein Co. In adapting Matthew Quicks 2008 novel Russell doesnt merely aim to tell the story of Pat Solatano (Cooper) a former substitute teacher and cuckolded husband whos just emerged from eight months in a mental institution. From d.p. Tasanobu Takayanagis whooshing zooming handheld camerawork to editor Jay Cassidys jumpy hyper-caffeinated rhythms the intent is clearly to bring the viewer into close identification with Pats troubled but weirdly upbeat mindset. At the same time this ensemble laffer manages to take a longer view of the characters recovery a journey aided in significant and quite unexpected ways by his friends and family. Returning to his familys home in Philly suburbia Pat reassures his warily supportive parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver) that he no longer needs medication hes in the best shape of his life and hes determined to woo back his wife Nikki who left him around the time of his confinement. But despite his persistent belief in silver linings (""Excelsior"" hes fond of repeating to himself) its not long before Pats bipolar disorder already apparent in his delusional tendencies and lack of anything resembling a verbal filter begins to violently reassert itself. Because the films immersive approach has little use for straightforward exposition it takes a while before the reasons for Pats meltdown and Nikkis subsequent restraining order against him become entirely clear. Around the same time Pat strikes up an unusual friendship with abrasive dark-haired widow Tiffany (Lawrence) a self-described ""crazy slut with a dead husband"" and apparently the sole neighborhood resident capable of relating to the local wacko. The films key tension is between Pats refusal to become intimate with a woman besides his wife and Tiffanys determination to open him up to new experiences possibilities and people. Falling into his arms tearfully one minute administering a sharp slap the next Tiffany is a marvelously unstable element daring Pat to judge her for her own past misdeeds though she has no qualms about cutting through his defenses and attacking what she sees or doesnt see in him. In a script that never lapses into mundane or uninteresting language the scenes between Pat and Tiffany are sculpted with an almost David Mamet-like sharpness amplified onscreen by the intimacy and focus of Russells direction and the superbly harmonized lead performances. Exuding his usual cranked-up charisma Cooper has one of his best roles here as a damaged soul whose misconceptions nonetheless hide an unimpeachable core integrity. Yet its Lawrences Tiffany who has the most dynamic effect on the picture always pushing Pat into a defensive position and remarkably making him look like a model of sanity by comparison. The films mildly farcical structure fleetingly recalls Russells ""Flirting With Disaster"" and ""I Heart Huckabees"" just as its fascination with psychologically unbalanced protagonists brings to mind the more squirm-inducing likes of ""Spanking the Monkey."" Yet if ""Silver Linings Playbook"" is a softer gentler thing than the directors previous works following a traditional finding-yourself-and-falling-in-love template in the guise of something moderately darker and more subversive it nonetheless boasts a level of charm heart and formal sophistication increasingly rare among adult-driven studio comedies. While the pics willingness to make light of Pats disorder may give some pause (at one point he and Tiffany bond over which meds they have and havent taken) it doesnt soft-pedal his journey to rock-bottom and Russells technique so bristlingly evokes the characters mental state that one feels sympathetically swept up in his experience rather than positioned outside it. After a somewhat saggy midsection the story takes a surprising and ultimately exhilarating turn as seemingly digressive subplots involving a ""So You Think You Can Dance""-style competition and the Solatanos idolatry of their favorite sports team the Philadelphia Eagles pay off bigtime in the closing reels. Pic sends the viewer out on an unabashed and hard-won high note. Chris Tucker makes a rare and effective appearance as Pats best mental-ward buddy Weaver is a warm delight as his pacifist mother and its hard to remember the last time De Niro was this effortlessly endearing and relaxed onscreen. Danny Elfmans music and the soundtrack supervised by Sue Jacobs (Stevie Wonders ""My Cherie Amour"" has a key plot function) compulsively thread in and out of the action always serving to reflect Pats heightened mental/emotional states. Other tech credits for the Pennsylvania-shot picture are pro. Silver Linings PlaybookProductionA Weinstein Co. release and presentation. Produced by Donna Gigliotti Bruce Cohen Jonathan Gordon.
