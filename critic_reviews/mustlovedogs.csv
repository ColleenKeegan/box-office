Advertising for a man who must love dogs on the internet Sarah must choose between sensitive boat-builder John Cusack sporty dad Dermot Mulroney and a host of comedy losers. We all know who she should plump for but she takes her time getting there busying herself with amiable scrapes and bonding sessions with her sisters. Theres a pleasing amount of dark wit in the screenplay some of it emanating from the fact that Sarah inadvertently makes a blind date with her own father (Christopher Plummer). But Cusacks character is hard to get a handle on and the plot is rambling. This may be better than your average rom-com but a sharper rewrite of Claire Cooks source novel could have made more of the quality cast. Still at least the dogs take a back seat letting the leads entertain without breaking a sweat.

Starring Diane Lane John Cusack and Dermot Mulroney. Directed by Gary David Goldberg. (PG-13. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Even for those who think there are worse ways to spend 100 minutes than to look at Diane Lane ""Must Love Dogs"" pushes it. This is a lackluster romantic comedy that feints in a couple of novel directions but mainly conforms to type the cute meeting the courtship the obligatory misunderstanding the obligatory aimlessness (usually a montage) followed by some ending one way or the other. Of course about 8000 good movies including ""Tootsie"" and ""Annie Hall"" could be described in that way but somehow when a movie is especially good it doesnt seem as though its filling out a pattern. ""Must Love Dogs"" does. The good news is that its not a complete failure -- it builds in the viewer a rooting interest in the lovers. But it doesnt transcend mediocrity because the climax has no impact. The film gets more tepid as it goes along and ultimately just drifts off. In fact the direction of some of the potentially big moments is so indifferent that at times I imagined an outraged screenwriter horrified at what the director had done to his material. It turns out that this isnt likely the case as Gary David Goldberg who directed the film also wrote the screenplay an adaptation of the novel by Claire Cook. Like most contemporary novels ""Must Love Dogs"" is about a newly divorced woman starting life on her own. Lane plays Sarah who seems to be some kind of cipher arriving at around 40 years old without having examined her life in any way. She apparently drifted through an unhappy marriage until her husband left her. Now her family -- big and loving with two sisters a brother and a widowed dad -- want to fix her up with somebody anybody. The title comes from the personal ad that her older sister (Elizabeth Perkins) places on the Internet. Among the men who answer the ad is Jake played by John Cusack. Jake handcrafts boats for a living a sexy job in that he has his hands all over something he calls ""she"" all day. But Jake is a lot more lively than Kevin Costner in ""Message in a Bottle"" who also built boats. Hes intense. He asks rude questions. He spends a lot of time watching ""Doctor Zhivago"" over and over. Hes slightly neurotic. If only he were a little more neurotic more rude and more intense ""Must Love Dogs"" might have been a better movie. As it stands despite a few quirks Jake is made not all that appreciably different from Bob a middle-aged smoothie played by Dermot Mulroney. This becomes a problem The movie suggests that it wants to make a distinction between the two men with one being honest and intense and the other being seductive and devious but the actors arent directed to play anything but average decent guys. Once again a bland choice. Of less consequence but equally odd is the fact that there are three roles in the movie for women in their 20s -- Sarahs co-worker Sarahs younger sister and a woman Jake dates -- and the three actresses cast in those roles look alike. Without numbers on their backs and a scorecard its hard to tell them apart. And what do we make of minor stuff like Sarah using the word ""charming"" three times in 10 minutes? ""Must Love Dogs"" feels slapdash. As for Lane shes lovely and I refuse to let this movie come between us. Her tentative reactions are comical and always fun to watch and she plays well with Cusack to the extent that she gets the chance. Cusack should have been half the picture but the screenplay keeps shoving him offstage for no good reason and its a mistake. One of many. -- Advisory This film contains sexual situations and sex talk.

"Must Love Dogs One Tail-Wagger of a Romance washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Must Love Dogs One Tail-Wagger of a Romance The warp and woof of life As a middle-aged divorcee Diane Lane turns a typical romantic comedy into something more. (By Claudette Barius -- Warner Bros. Pictures) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday July 29 2005 ""Must Love Dogs"" this summers first bona fide romantic comedy stars Diane Lane in a role that is threatening to become her own casting ghetto that of the recent divorcee looking for love with the help of her gay best friends. That was the story line in ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" Lanes last movie; here Italy has been supplanted by the far less visually compelling Southern California and the gay best friends have been moved to the background in favor of a warmly meddling Irish Catholic family. But the basic rules still apply and despite the movies patently outlandish contrivances and too-precious dialogue it works. It works because Lane is one of those actresses who can do just about anything and still earn the audiences undying love. Is it that adorable furrowed brow? That nervous smile? The way she unlike nearly every other actress working today actually once in a while looks as if she might need a little sleep? Whatever it is Lane possesses that ineffable quality that makes her not only sensational but appealing not only drop-dead gorgeous but unthreatening. To paraphrase what they said about James Bond men want her women want to be her. Or more precisely men think that she isnt completely out of their league and women dont look at her and immediately want to give up. And in case weve forgotten since her Oscar-nominated turn in ""Unfaithful"" Lane can act which in ""Must Love Dogs"" means she can make even the most canned ersatz predictable material ring true. Luckily her opposite number John Cusack brings the same warmth and appeal to the enterprise making what might have been a strictly by-the-numbers chick flick into an improbably smart and genial little mental getaway. Whats more these two generate real slow-burning rapport so that youre still pulling for them even during a gratingly preposterous climax. Based on the novel by Claire Cook ""Must Love Dogs"" features Lane as Sarah a 40-year-old preschool teacher whos been dumped by her rotter of a husband and who as the movie opens is the subject of a dating intervention by her sprawling family. Let it be said that Sarah in fact does not own a dog; thats just a flourish her older sister (Elizabeth Perkins) includes when she takes it upon herself to place an ad for Sarah on an Internet dating service. Meanwhile across town boat-builder Jake (Cusack) also recently divorced is the subject of similar lobbying from his best friend. Jake and Sarah meet cute at a local dog park the conversation is something of a disaster and the rest of ""Must Love Dogs"" concerns itself with how these two perfect-for-each-other singletons will cut their way through the chaff to find each other again. ""Must Love Dogs"" has been adapted and directed by Gary David Goldberg best known for creating such television hits as ""Family Ties"" and ""Spin City"" and it has the visual glow and glib repartee of a particularly high-end sitcom; its the kind of middlebrow popcorn-friendly rom-com that we used to depend on Nora Ephron to make. You wont necessarily believe a word of a movie that features a male lead who builds wooden boats in his brick-and-timber loft is a fan of both ""Doctor Zhivago"" and the Ramones and has no discernible means of support but Goldberg and his two leads clearly understand love of a certain age. Like ""As Good as It Gets"" and the uneven ""Somethings Gotta Give"" ""Must Love Dogs"" takes an often mordant look at middle-aged romance and finds a rich vein of humor. (A sequence during which Jake and Sarah try to consummate their attraction is hilariously on-point.) Whats more ""Must Love Dogs"" features an enormously appealing supporting cast including Christopher Plummer as Sarahs single dad (who features in one of the movies funniest gags) Stockard Channing as a blowzy trailer-dwelling divorcee with a heart of gold and a little-known actress named Jordana Spiro who steals every scene shes in as a giggly round-heeled ditz. Reportedly Cusack asked Goldberg to rewrite his dialogue to make it more in keeping with his own brainy rapid-fire cadences and if thats true it was a good idea. His scenes with Lane crackle with all the giddy hopes and anxieties of a man newly smitten and an early monologue he delivers in which Jake expounds on his narrative theory of romantic relationships actually makes much more sense than the usual ""You complete me"" blather. Likewise Lane who undergoes dozens of makeovers in the course of several funny first -- and last -- dates with her Internet correspondents is always rooted and radiant even at her most depressed (is there anyone else alive who makes haggard look this good?). If the audience roots for Jake and Sarah its not because theyre particularly well-written characters but because the actors so skillfully manage to make their authentic selves visible beneath the veneer. In ""Must Love Dogs"" that veneer is usually either prissily manicured or self-consciously goofy; this is a movie after all that features references to Yeats and ""The Partridge Family."" Its all as sunny and super-cute as Sarahs perfect little house and the films Big Scene which is supposedly propelled by the desperation of the main character seems more motivated by the desperation of the director. But despite such occasional stretches and thanks to its splendid lead players ""Must Love Dogs"" has the affable cuddly charm that its title so hopefully invokes. Must Love Dogs (98 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for sexual content.

"No Love for This Dog washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On No Love for This Dog And doggie makes three John Cusack and Diane Lane fall in love in the dismal romantic comedy ""Must Love Dogs."" (By Claudette Barius) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Jen Chaney Special to The Washington Post Friday July 29 2005 Heres a list of the individuals who will absolutely adore ""Must Love Dogs"" A People who dont get out much. A Pet owners who say ""Awww"" every time they see a commercial for Purina Puppy Chow. A Thirty-something women so obsessed with John Cusack they even loved ""Money for Nothing."" A The entire marketing department at Perfectmatch.com. As for the rest of the movie-going public ""Must Love Dogs"" -- a listless cliche-ridden tale of two divorcees who meet through an online dating service -- stands as yet another example of how easy it is for filmmakers to fail at romantic comedy. The usually radiant Diane Lane loses a little of her luster in her role as Sarah Nolan a recently divorced preschool teacher from a large Irish family each member of which is more than willing to suggest prospective men for her to date. Apparently even though Sarah is beautiful works a fulfilling job has great friends loving relatives and a stunning home her life is on the verge of disaster because shes single. Consequently her sister Carol (Elizabeth Perkins) creates a profile for Sarah on -- you guessed it -- Perfectmatch.com. ""Must Love Dogs"" may not succeed as a movie but as a product placement for a Web site it gets two thumbs way up. Sarahs venture into online romance leads to a torrential downpour of mostly disastrous first dates and eventually an encounter at a dog park with Jake (Cusack) a boat builder (yes I said boat builder) who also is attempting to recover from a divorce. Hes quirky and cute and can make his best friends West Highland terrier roll over and play dead. (Thats your cue Purina Puppy Chow people Awww.) Naturally Sarah is interested but shes also intrigued by Bob (Dermot Mulroney) the flirtatious father of one of her students who also has recently become single. Thats about as deep as the conflicts get in ""Must Love Dogs"" which was adapted from the novel by Claire Cook and written and directed by Gary David Goldberg best known for creating TVs ""Family Ties"" and ""Spin City."" Perhaps Goldbergs sitcom pedigree is part of the problem Most of the movie consists of disjointed scenes that end with cutesy punch lines but never connect as part of an affecting narrative. Like most modern romantic comedies -- perhaps Hollywoods most consistently mishandled genre -- ""Must Love Dogs"" is so busy copying from better films that it forgets to present anything approximating real life. And the best romantic comedies are always about life as much as love. Even though theyre portrayed by talented actors -- in addition to Lane Cusack and Mulroney Christopher Plummer and Stockard Channing are part of the cast -- none of these characters seems like a real flesh-and-blood person. Theyre more like dolls forced to do and say the things Goldberg wants to pretend real people say and do when theyre grappling with relationships. Like every single woman in every crummy chick flick ever made Lane bathes in a tub surrounded by scented candles weeps in the shower when shes depressed and eats chicken over the kitchen sink while Sheryl Crows version of ""The First Cut Is the Deepest"" plays on the soundtrack. And Cusack who looks like he just wants to get the heck out of this movie as soon as he can drowns his sorrows while watching ""Doctor Zhivago"" so the audience will know hes a sensitive male. But he also wears a Ramones T-shirt. Because you know that means hes punk and edgy. The most depressing thing of all actually is watching Cusack who may be the Crown Prince of Gen X Romantic Comedies in such a trite and lackluster affair. Lloyd Dobler the character Cusack played in the endearing and enduring ""Say Anything"" would have no patience for a movie like this. Lloyd was always looking for a dare-to-be-great situation. And this is nothing but a dare-to-be-terrible movie. MUST LOVE DOGS (PG-13 88 minutes) -- Contains sexual content. Area theaters.

"HarmlessDogs is just too cute - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW HarmlessDogs is just too cute By Wesley Morris Globe Staff  |  July 29 2005 When a man is dumb enough to neglect or divorce Diane Lane in a movie the upside tends to be more for us.Who else in Hollywood is as believably self-doubting? A Lane picture nowadays involves her rediscovery of what we already know to be true -- that her earthly radiance has no peer. While that can be an invigorating experience she cant entirely make Must Love Dogs"" as pleasurable to watch as she is.The movie is harmless and crowd-pleasing and sometimes uproariously accurate about the debilitating self-consciousness of being newly single. But while Lane is her typical winning self the film is mawkish. The more were cajoled to root for Sarah Nolan the divorced preschool teacher she plays the more Must Love Dogs"" stops resembling a movie and starts feeling like a greeting card.The story gets going after Sarahs shameless sister Carol -- played by Elizabeth Perkins a sharp actress who deserves bigger parts -- creates an online personals ad in Sarahs name. It bills her as voluptuous features her high-school graduation photo and insists that any man who responds must love dogs.Across town Jake Anderson another divorce (John Cusack) has also had his profile thrown online by a friend (Ben Shenkman). Jake likes to sit at home and wallow in idealism preferably under a blanket watching Doctor Zhivago"" his apotheosis of romance. For once in a movie like this the Meg Ryan part is played by a man.In the films best scene Jake and Sarah meet in a dog park. The pets are borrowed. Hers is Mother Teresa a big Newfoundland that belongs to her brother. His is a little West Highland white terrier that belongs to his buddy; its good at playing dead. Jake accidentally insults Sarah asking why she called herself voluptuous when the term is typically deployed as a euphemism for fat. She bristles and insults him back.The encounter has a charming awkwardness Two wary strangers try to disarm each other in public while puzzling over the absurdities of online dating. And Lane and Cusack whos in rare witty form establish a crackling connection that ought to whisk them into a smarter romantic comedy but Im probably getting ahead of myself.Delaying the inevitable between Sarah and John theres a side plot in which Sarah goes out with the father (Dermot Mulroney) of one of her students. Theres also another story line in which her own debonair father (Christopher Plummer) a widower builds himself a harem of middle-age prospects.The most garish of them Dolly (Stockard Channing) lives in a trailer has taste in Southwestern accessories that runs toward the trashy and treats online dating as though it were a role-playing game.Sarah actually heeds the advice Dolly gives her about the joys of false advertising. Yet watching Lane superimpose her face onto a fly-fishers or dress in a dozen uncharacterisic styles on dates (oy that perm) is more sad than funny. It feels like a betrayal of what is so appealingly practical and intelligent both about the character and the star playing her. Chaka Khan was every woman. Diane Lane is not.TV veteran Gary David Goldberg directs Must Love Dogs"" which is adapted from a Claire Cook bestseller and he rarely passes up an opportunity to ladle on cuteness. The audience I saw the movie with went aww"" at all the right moments such as when Mother Teresa rolls over to cuddle with Sarah one night in bed. The movie is part sitcom and part television dramedy. And Goldberg doesnt apologize for relying on the artificial buoyancy of either. He gleefully slaps on a Nolan family sing-along to the Partridge Family"" theme for good measure. Cmon get happy"" has rarely sounded more like a threat.

NoRomantic comedy is a waste of talentBy Paul Clinton For CNN.com Diane Lane and John Cusack in ""Must Love Dogs."" YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Review John Cusack Diane Lane or Create Your Own Manage Alerts | What Is This? (CNN) -- My reaction to the new romantic comedy ""Must Love Dogs"" is simple No I dont.Not dogs the animal. ""Dogs"" the movie. Indeed calling it a dog is an insult to canines.Despite the talented actors involved -- Diane Lane John Cusack Christopher Plummer and Dermot Mulroney among them -- this film never rises above the level of a half-baked situation comedy.The basic premise deals with the perils of Internet dating. Lane plays Sarah Nolan a schoolteacher who has been divorced for eight months when her family forces her back into the shark-filled waters of the dating game.Unbeknownst to Sarah her two busybody sisters -- Carol (a very perky Elizabeth Perkins) and Christine (Ali ""why am I in this movie I have no part"" Hillis) -- have a plan. They post her profile on an Internet dating service with the following message ""Voluptuous sensuous alluring and fun. DWF seeks special man to share starlit nights. Must love dogs.""What follows is painfully predictable. There are endless vignettes involving the total losers Sarah encounters online. Every date is a walking cliche. The only interesting aspect of these scenes is Lanes ever-changing hairstyle.Meanwhile Sarahs dapper widowed father (Plummer) has become an aging lothario dating a bevy of desperate women hes met online. His main squeeze ends up being hippy-dippy Dolly (Stockard Channing) who apparently gets her make-up tips from Tammy Faye Bakker Messner.Sure there are complications. At one point Sarah actually meets her own father for a date arranged through an online setup. Thats rather creepy especially for this movie.Film by numbersDuring her quest through dating hell Sarah becomes attracted to the recently divorced father of one of her students Bob Conner played by Mulroney. With his floppy hair and crooked grin he seems to be too good to be true. Given the lack of creativity in ""Must Love Dogs"" thats exactly what he is. Lanes character is put back into the dating scene by her sisters played by Elizabeth Perkins (center) and Ali Hillis (right). Finally Cusack appears as an idealistic romantic boat builder named Jake Anderson who has an almost unnatural attraction to the film ""Dr. Zhivago."" (Get it? Hes sensitive.) Of course Sarah and Jake arrange to meet in a dog park and -- of course -- the relationship gets off to a very shaky start.Soon however Jake begins to grow on her and she must decide between the handsome Conner and the slightly off-key but appealing Anderson.Written and directed by Gary David Goldberg (based on a book by Claire Cook) ""Must Love Dogs"" is amazingly trite and shallow. Goldberg is best known for his TV sitcom work especially the highly successful ""Family Ties."" With this film his roots are showing. Every joke is telegraphed and every plot point is banged in with a sledgehammer.The picture-perfect town the film is set in makes Disneyland look like a slum. Its all so cute youll want to grind your teeth.""Must Love Dogs"" isnt really a film. Its a series of postcard moments interspersed with some lame comedic moments. You can almost hear a laugh track in the background -- but even a laugh track would strain to find ""Must Love Dogs"" entertaining.

Must Love Dogs John Cusack and Diane Lane fall for each other in a comedy about dating after divorce. Warner Bros. Pictures Much as I hate the term -- and very often the genre itself -- its a bona fide chick flick. But while so many films in that genre try to manipulate audiences to tears Dogs is all about laughs. The sometimes corny story based on a novel by Claire Cook is raised to a higher level by the presence of John Cusack an actor who embodies warmth wit intelligence and low-key charm. (Related video Watch the Must Love Dogs trailer) Director Gary David Goldberg has said he gave the script to Cusack to add his own touches resulting in some clever and engaging repartee with Diane Lane another intelligent and likable actor. Lane plays Sarah a preschool teacher who has been divorced for almost a year. Her Irish-American family keeps needling her about getting back into the dating world. About the movie Must Love Dogs    (out of four) Stars Diane Lane John Cusack Dermot Mulroney Christopher Plummer Elizabeth Perkins Stockard Channing Director Gary David Goldberg Distributor Warner Bros. Running time 1 hour 28 minutes Rated PG-13 for sexual content Opens Friday nationwide To that end her well-meaning but overbearing older sister (Elizabeth Perkins) submits Sarahs profile to an Internet dating service. Meanwhile their widowed dad (Christopher Plummer) is having no problem on the romantic front. Stockard Channing plays a brassy New Age-y woman who is one of several who fall for the wise and winsome father. The movie has a sluggish start but picks up as Sarah slogs through a series of deadbeat dates some funny some pathetic who respond to the provocative cyber-ad and high school photo provided by her sister. But the man she is drawn to is the separated father (Dermot Mulroney) of one of her students. Then she meets Cusack a builder of old-style wooden boats who comes across a little off-kilter and intense yet strangely disarming. They go through the usual cycle of attraction misunderstanding and reuniting that is the mainstay of romantic comedies. Theirs is a match made in cinematic heaven and it feels forced that she even hesitates about being with him. If not for the leads who share chemistry and cheeky banter audiences would feel as if they have seen this movie before. Certainly the premise of returning to dating after divorce is nothing new. And the supporting performances of Mulroney Perkins and Plummer are winning. But a caveat to canine lovers The title is misleading. Dogs dont play a significant part in the film. Lanes character is dog-sitting an adorable black Newfoundland but its used essentially as a comic device. If you want to see Lane co-star with an endearing pooch in a heart-tugging movie try My Dog Skip which is not a chick flick but still a tearjerker.

Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr (Must Love Dogs Claudette Barius) C- Must Love Dogs Genre Comedy Romance; Starring John Cusack Diane Lane Stockard Channing Dermot Mulroney Elizabeth Perkins; Director Gary David Goldberg; Author Gary David Goldberg; Release Date Wide 07/29/2005; Runtime (in minutes) 93; MPAA Rating PG-13; Distributor Warner Bros. Posted July 27 2005 -- 1200 AM EDT Good looks in theory shouldnt limit a movie star but when you see Diane Lane in Must Love Dogs as Sarah a divorced preschool teacher in her late 30s who is so skittish and insecure about men that she dithers with doubt like the young Mary Tyler Moore crossed with somebody out of an old Woody Allen movie...well sorry but I couldnt buy it. Its not simply that Lane is gorgeous; she has the calm direct gaze the beaming ease of flirtation that so frequently comes with beauty. Self-deprecatory neurosis doesnt jibe with her features. But in the world according to writer-director Gary David Goldberg everyone deep down is a good person and that goodness is established by ones ability to carry on like a winsomely nerdish loser. Timid and vulnerable naked in her desperation Sarah lunges at every decent man who looks her way primping in the supermarket aisle making goo-goo eyes at the recently separated father (Dermot Mulroney) of one of her students. Time and again however her amorous instincts are overruled by caution. ""Hes looking for the whole dance"" she says of one of her prospects ""and Im just starting to relearn the steps."" If a line like that is enough to make you cringe then do yourself a favor and steer clear of Must Love Dogs. The people in this movie dont talk exactly. They patter with that hollow cloying rattletrap cleverness common to bad sitcoms at the moment they reveal their ""sincerity."" Sarah a saintly sweetheart is surrounded by relatives who keep telling her to buck up and find a man and never have I seen an Irish family with quite this many yentas in it. One of her sisters (Elizabeth Perkins) places an ad for her on an Internet dating site and before long Sarah is subjecting herself to the anxious semi-charade -- oh those youthful photos -- of digital personal ads. She meets Jake (John Cusack) a guy so sensitive that he carves rowing shells out of wood and weeps during Doctor Zhivago. Cusack whose overfamiliar arch mannerisms once the stuff of hipster tude now mesh all too well with the banter of a film like this is so clearly right for our heroine that Goldberg a director who thinks in episodes has to keep coming up with lame new ways to stall their getting together. (A frantic late-night hunt for condoms is a particular low point.) This is a movie of fake conflict fake heart even fake doggy love.

"Must Love Dogs | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; must-love-dogs ) Must Love Dogs (United States 2005) A movie review by James Berardinelli Must Love Dogs is a product - a pre-packaged easily-digestible motion picture designed with one particular audience in mind. You know the kind of film. You have seen it before usually with names like Nancy Myers or Nora amp; Delia Ephron involved. Those with ovaries have a better chance of appreciating Must Love Dogs than those with testicles. For some members of the latter group sitting through this will be akin to having those organs trodden upon. Must Love Dogs is bland and forgettable - a romantic comedy with affable characters and some funny lines but where love never really takes flight. It fizzles when it should sizzle. Sarah (Diane Lane) is a recently divorced woman who is intimidated by the thought of returning to the dating scene. Before the ink is dry on her divorce decree various members of her family - including her forthright sister Carol (Elizabeth Perkins) and her father Bill (Christopher Plummer) - are urging her to get ""out there."" Carol even goes so far as to put Sarahs profile up at an on-line dating service which results in a number of supposedly hilarious misfires. (One of these is funny; the rest are re-treads of bad blind dates we have seen in dozens of other movies.) Eventually she meets Jake (John Cusack) a guy whos different from the losers she has been hooking up with. Jake has the soul of a poet and the verbiage of a philosopher and like Sarah he is still coming to terms with the breakup of his marriage and no longer knows how to date. Their first encounter doesnt go well but each is willing to try again. A threat to their newly-hatched relationship occurs when Sarah an elementary school teacher falls for Bob (Dermot Mulroney) the father of one of her pupils. The strange thing about Must Love Dogs is that its funnier than the average romantic comedy (most of which lack true laugh-aloud humor) but less romantic. Theres a great scene in which Sarah and her father are matched up for a blind date. Theres a late night quest for an open drug store selling condoms. There are some pointed comments about Dr. Zhivago. And the opening ""interviews"" are on-target. This stuff works. Sadly the love affair between Sarah and Jake does not. There are no sparks. They seem better suited to be best friends than lovers and it shows. Plus while Sarah is at home in this sort of by-the-numbers movie Jake is out of place. Hes a riff on the character John Cusack played in High Fidelity or Say Anything and is out of step with writer/director Gary David Goldbergs screenplay. Thats not a bad thing - I enjoyed watching Jake - but hes more interesting than the material surrounding him. Maybe the relationship between Sarah and Jake would have worked if they had been given more screen time together. Unfortunately Must Love Dogs feels the need to incorporate the age-old contrivance of ""romantic complications."" In this case they are provided by Bob who is supposed to be engaging and charismatic but is instead boring. Dermot Mulroney looks like hes playing the part under duress. Perhaps its a symptom of Sarahs desperation that she is attracted to this personality-deprived individual. We dont like or dislike Bob - hes just sort of there taking up space and screen time and limiting interaction between the protagonists. This prompts me to raise a quibble I have about romantic comedies Whats wrong with a movie that takes its full 90 minutes to develop a living breathing relationship between two people? Why clutter things up with superfluous characters whose only purpose is to keep the lovers apart until the end? Other romantic comedy elements are recycled from the scrap-heap. Both Sarah and Jake have support groups (although Jakes ""support group"" numbers one) who act as a Greek chorus in critiquing potential partners. There are several cute animals and a cuddly gay couple who like most gay couples in movies designed for heterosexuals avoid anything overtly sexual so as to remain unthreatening. Theres a young blond bimbo who has the hots for Jake (just to ensure that the romantic complications arent one-sided). And the climax involves one of the parties chasing the other to make a confession of love before its too late. Its fair to argue that there are not many romantic comedies available featuring middle-aged characters. So why when one is made does it have the same rhythm as what we get with similar movies for twenty-somethings? Neither The Upside of Anger nor Somethings Gotta Give was a perfect motion picture but both took things in more interesting directions. Must Love Dogs reluctance to put a chip in the mold becomes its undoing. Diane Lane and John Cusack are better actors than the material but their presence will function as a chick flick magnet. Sadly only those with minimal expectations will come away satisfied. There are things to like about Must Love Dogs but not enough to earn it more than a half-hearted nod.

Thesps maverick turn steals the show in this otherwise middling romantic comedy which retools standard meet-cute elements for the Web generation in pleasant but uninspired fashion. Fortunately the charming match-up with Diane Lane goes down smoothly enough. Affectionate interest in both leads could generate solid distaff B.O. early on though word-of-mouth wont sizzle. This is the first film in more than 15 years from writer-director Gary David Goldberg a veteran TV scribe (""MASH"" ""Lou Grant"" ""Family Ties"") and some viewers may recognize the Ubu Prods. credit (in this context ""Sit Ubu sit Good dog"" Ubu takes on an entirely new angle). Even when it doesnt entirely succeed Goldbergs literate screenplay has an old-fashioned almost preternaturally classy vibe recalling a time when characters chose their words more carefully and spoke at greater length. Yet the script also betrays a weakness for quaint obvious humor and a habit of striking its notes with too-on-the-nose precision. Viewer is thrown into the premise from the very first frame in a sitcom-like ensemble scene that finds divorced preschool teacher Sarah (Lane) being pressured by her mob-like family -- an intervention they call it -- to return to the dating scene. The most meddlesome of the bunch is Carol (a perky Elizabeth Perkins) who without her sisters permission signs Sarah up for an Internet dating service with a fake online profile that describes her as voluptuous and includes the requirement of the films title. At 40 the stunningly beautiful Lane brings the right twinkle of careworn radiance to her role with a simmering undercurrent of anger that emerges briefly but fiercely. Lane is too lively and bracing a presence however to sell Sarahs occasional moping -- which doesnt seem to fit Sarah anyway. Sarah fields plenty of undesirable bachelors through the dating Web site -- including in a mortifying coincidence her own father (Christopher Plummer). Unfortunately the bachelor vignettes turn out to be notable less for their comic payoffs than for Sarahsfascinating assortment of hairdos (styled by Candy L. Walken).Somewhat more satisfyingly she also starts a flirtation with Bob (""Call me Bobby"") the newly separated dad of one of her young students played by Dermot Mulroney. It takes Sarah a while to finally meet Cusacks Jake (at a dog park naturally) though auds are introduced to him well before that. Philosophical and hyper-articulate a builder of racing boats whose favorite weekend activity is watching ""Doctor Zhivago"" Jake is a hopeless romantic and master of comic introspection. Cusacks offbeat perf is a dazzling display of nonstop verbiage so prodigious its tempting to suspect that the actor who always seems to be sneaking in dialogue ahead of and behind the beat was allowed free rein to improvise. Non-fans however may recoil from what is essentially a mellifluous stream of blarney one not too far removed from the other soulful smart alecks Cusack has played in the past. Indeed Sarah is put off by Jake on their first meeting. Goldbergs script eventually reveals a subtle yet unmistakable strain of moralism largely dictated by which characters are sleeping together and which arent (Sarah and Jake get in the mood only to find themselves on a wild goose chase for contraceptives). Given the frivolity of most mainstream movie sex this selective prudery weighs in as almost refreshing. By contrast the promiscuous Bob(by) is set up rather too tidily as a straw villain though Mulroney plays him with the right combo of sleaze and charm. Pic underlines its point by giving Sarahs father an online companion of his own played with poignancy by Stockard Channing. Supporting is solid especially Brad William Henke in the token role of Sarahs gay best friend and Plummer who adopts a gentle Irish accent as Sarahs father. Craig Armstrongs lilting musical score is noticeably Irish in flavor. Less successful is an embarrassing musical number halfway through in which Sarah and the family bust out in ""Come On Get Happy"" -- a regrettable attempt to match the joie de vivre of the ""I Say a Little Prayer"" sing-along from ""My Best Friends Wedding.""
