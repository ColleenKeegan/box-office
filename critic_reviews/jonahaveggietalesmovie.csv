Photo LIAM DANIEL FILM CLIPS / Also opening today 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Heaven Drama. Starring Cate Blanchett and Giovanni Ribisi. Directed by Tom Tykwer. Written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz. (R. 97 minutes. At the Embarcadero.) It seems the oddest of cinematic matches Tom Tykwer director of the dynamic joyfully kinesthetic ""Run Lola Run"" and Krzysztof Kieslowski the late Polish filmmaker whose somber films (""Red"" ""The Double Life of Veronique"") deal in mystic notions of destiny love and synchronicity. Odd on the surface perhaps but ""Heaven"" the film that Tykwer has made from a Kieslowski script proves how much the two filmmakers have in common. Written before Kieslowskis death in 1996 and intended as the first of a trilogy ""Heaven"" is a mystical tale of two souls joined in love but divided from society seeking redemption and understanding before they pass to another plane. Cate Blanchett one of the great actresses working today is mesmerizing as a British schoolteacher living in Italy who accidentally kills four people while avenging her husbands death. Giovanni Ribisi who looks like an angel in Italian Renaissance paintings plays the Italian police officer who falls in love with her springs her loose and escapes with her into the Tuscan hills. Tykwer directs with long takes spans of silence and a deep sense of celestial awe. He imbues the young lovers significantly named Philippa and Filippo with a spiritual glow and timeless beauty. Theyre creatures of fate - - martyred by purity -- and could easily be transposed to any century. The problem with ""Heaven"" rests in unresolved ethics. Philippa had intended to kill only one man -- the drug pusher she holds responsible for her husbands death -- but the movie lets her off the hook for the four murders she inadvertently committed. Blanchetts character doesnt transcend the mundane world as Tykwers luminous images suggest; she merely abandons her responsibility. Advisory This film contains nudity and brief violence. -- Edward Guthmann ABANDON Drama. Starring Katie Holmes Benjamin Bratt Charlie Hunnam Zooey Deschanel Melanie Lynskey Gabrielle Union Gabriel Mann and Fred Ward. Directed and written by Stephen Gaghan. (PG-13. 99 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Take an interesting subject (the social/academic/job pressures faced by college seniors) center it on a cute compelling actress (Katie Holmes) write a plot that involves a slew of men whove loved and abandoned her and give the film to a successful screenwriter (Stephen Gaghan) for his first directorial effort and what do you get? You get a disjointed movie with uneven acting and too many scenes that defy belief. You also get (and these are the movies strengths) a visually arresting movie set at an Ivy League campus that features a lineup of quirky characters. Many of these characters are under suspicion by a police detective (Benjamin Bratt) investigating the disappearance of a student named Embry (Charlie Hunnam) who was once in love with Holmes character the aptly named Katie. The rich brash and handsome Embry may have sneaked back on campus and may be trying to kill his former paramour. Katie is haunted by visions of him. Shes also haunted by memories of her father who left her when she was a little girl and she is overcome by all the romantic attention she receives. Even her psychotherapist is interested in her and its clear Bratts character would like to sleep with her if he had the chance. A breakdown seems inevitable though outwardly Katie seems to have it all good looks above-average intelligence handsome suitors a group of close- knit friends and a post-graduation job offer that goes only to elite students. Appearances are deceiving. Lets just say the pattern of behavior in ""Abandon"" leads to a jolting climax that seems disingenuous. Gaghan may have won an Academy Award for his screenplay of ""Traffic"" but no one will take home an Oscar for ""Abandon."" Thats OK. Some movies are exercises in escapism and this movie is no more and no less than that. Advisory This film contains violence strong language and sex scenes. -- Jonathan Curiel MERCI POUR LE CHOCOLAT  Drama. Starring Isabelle Huppert. Directed by Claude Chabrol. Written by Caroline Eliacheff and Chabrol. (Not rated. 99 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At the Opera Plaza Shattuck in Berkeley and Rafael Film Center in San Rafael.) Few actresses are better at conveying duplicity than Isabelle Huppert. Effortlessly her face settles into a mask of glacial well-being her delicate bones and ambiguous smile hiding the malice beneath. French director Claude Chabrol Hupperts collaborator on five previous films knows exactly how to use that mask to its best advantage. In ""Merci Pour le Chocolat"" an elegant study in perversity he casts Huppert as Mika Muller a Swiss chocolate-company heiress and wife to a respected concert pianist (Jacques Dutronc). Mikas life is superficially perfect riches brilliant husband splendid estate in Lausanne overlooking Lake Geneva. The movie opens with her second wedding to Andre; the first when Mika was 18 ended in divorce. In between Andre married Louise who died in a car crash but gave him his 18-year-old son Guillaume (Rodolphe Pauly). Huppert sketches Mika in minimalist strokes. ""Im always meddling"" she admits a mild allusion to her wickedness. Did she poison her husbands ex- wife and what does she plan for Jeanne (Anna Mouglalis) the beautiful young pianist who suddenly appears saying she may be Andres daughter. ""Merci Pour le Chocolat"" has a restraint and rigor that we dont see in commercial American films the kind that a director creates when he has no interest in sentimentality or in soliciting the audiences favor. Huppert so breathtakingly evil in this years ""The Piano Teacher"" is Chabrols ideal actress happy to explore the dark and woolly corners of human nature bold enough to be despicable. Advisory This film contains sexual situations and mature themes. -- Edward Guthmann BELOW Thriller. Starring Bruce Greenwood and Olivia Williams. Directed by David Twohy. Written by Darren Aronofsky Lucas Sussman and Twohy. (R. 104 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Its World War II and were patrolling the Atlantic on the Tiger Shark a submarine stalking Nazi U-boats. The captain dies in a freak accident a rigid lieutenant (Bruce Greenwood) assumes command and weird things happen that suggest a haunting. Is there an ""Alien"" on board the sub? Or is the crew merely suffering from claustrophobia and hydrogen narcosis -- a condition induced by breathing too much hydrogen -- and hallucinating those eerie sounds those fleeting visions in the shadows? Director and genre-mixer David Twohy (""Pitch Black"") combines elements from horror supernatural and battle pictures and displays a strong gift for visual dazzle and inventive shots. Case in point The camera looks through a periscope at Greenwoods blue eye and finds the object of his vision -- a huge battleship -- reflected. Twohy captures the fierce mounting tension of men trapped underwater -- and amplifies the tension when a British nurse (Olivia Williams) rescued from a torpedoed hospital ship comes on board. But Twohys overwrought comic-book theatrics work against him as does the hokey script that he Lucas Sussman and director Darren Aronofsky (""Requiem for a Dream"") all fiddled with. The dialogue heavy on sarcasm and puncturing insults never captures the World War II period but sounds ridiculously anachronistic. Williams who has to endure a slug in the jaw and an onslaught of sexist slurs (""Brillo pad"" for starters) holds her own while Greenwood summoning the moral rectitude with which he played JFK in ""Thirteen Days"" clenches his jaw and conjures Robert Stack. Advisory This film contains violence and raw language. -- Edward Guthmann WELCOME TO COLLINWOOD Comedy. Starring Sam Rockwell William H. Macy Jennifer Esposito George Clooney. Directed and written by Anthony and Joe Russo. (R. 86 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). Every time George Clooney appears as a wisecracking safecracker ""Welcome to Collinwood"" becomes the high-spirited goof its supposed to be. Maybe thats because Clooneys presence elicits memories of another better ensemble heist comedy ""Oceans 11."" Clooney and ""Oceans"" director Steven Soderbergh produced ""Collinwood"" a likable but meandering picture about a gang of criminals from a hardscrabble Cleveland neighborhood who plan a pawnshop job. Clooney acts with the exuberance of walk-on in his brief scenes leaving the heavy lifting to a cast of indie stalwarts that includes Sam Rockwell Jennifer Esposito William H. Macy and Luis Guzman. The actors give it a go but filmmakers Anthony and Joe Russo never create a cohesive film. Instead ""Collinwood"" seems like a series of sketches with caricatures instead of characters a washed-up boxer who turns to crime (Rockwell); a prisoner in penguin stripes (Guzman) and a skull-capped photographer (Macy) who totes a baby in some scenes and a plaster cast on his arm in others. The abundant costumery sometimes gives the movie a vibe of a ""Clue"" cast reunion. But ""Collinwood"" also has a sweetness about it. Based on the 1958 Italian film ""Big Deal on Madonna Street"" the movie also resembles those Depression- era tales of decent but down-on-their-luck criminals. Macy wants in on the heist because he cant afford his wifes 1000 bail. Thats desperation. As the failed boxer Rockwell (""Charlies Angels""; ""Box of Moonlight"") shimmies and jives and reinvents every formulaic scene he occupies. Hes got real chemistry with Esposito who plays a maid who could lead him to the pawnbrokers cash. Rockwell and Esposito usually have to steal scenes in other peoples movies but here they get to be romantic leads. Only Guzman seems the slightest bit menacing. As the angry double-crossed brains of the outfit he throws some electrifying fits but doesnt stick around long. Macy as a dead-broke guy with a wife in prison and a baby to feed is the gangs earnest conscience. ""Collinwood"" seems innocent enough to have been made in the 1950s except for its liberal use of the ""F"" word. The picture also throws around plenty of movie-criminalese using terms like ""bellini"" (an easy big-payoff job) and ""mullinsky"" (a fall guy). This conceit will distract much of the audience but might resonate with senior citizens who spent time in the pen. Advisory This film contains raw language. -- Carla Meyer JONAH A VEGGIETALES MOVIE Animation. Co-directed and written by Phil Vischer and Mike Nawrocki. (G. 87 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Why should you keep an eye on a movie about singing vegetables? Because it will be interesting to see what kind of dent this makes in the movie market. In a limited release last weekend ""Jonah"" took in a tidy 6.2 million. Now it is showing on more than 1000 screens with a premiere in Northern California and the Northeast. Pretty impressive for an unabashed primer on what the production company calls ""biblical values and . . . spiritual growth."" Can this kind of overt religious message make waves in todays popular culture? Its possible. Shooting for the post-Barney crowd the studio has concocted as jolly a bunch of veggies as you are likely to encounter. Kids will enjoy the wisecracks and foolishness and the big musical production numbers are toe-tappers -- or would be if the veggies had feet. But it must be said that if you werent expecting it the religious themes are a bit of a surprise. After about 15 minutes of cheery slapstick from Bob the Tomato and Archibald Asparagus we are abruptly thrust into the story of Jonah ""prophet of God."" Sample lyric from one of Jonahs tunes ""Dont eat pigs/ Dont eat bats/ Beetles flies or gnats."" Or what about when the crew of the pirate ship plays ""Go Fish"" to learn which of them has made God so angry that he has called up a terrible storm? Those unfamiliar with Jonahs story from the Bible may find that confusing. On the other hand in a moment that captures the jokey tone Jonah loses at ""Go Fish"" and says he will have to throw himself overboard. ""Oh you dont have to do that"" says a crew member. ""We have a plank."" In short if a big musical number like ""Praise the Lord Hes the God of Second Chances"" doesnt put you off this will be an enjoyable choice for younger kids. Certainly there is nothing wrong with the message of giving people a second chance and forgiving mistakes. -- C.W. Nevius FORMULA 51 Action comedy. Starring Samuel L. Jackson Robert Carlyle Emily Mortimer and Meat Loaf. Directed by Ronny Yu. (R. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Samuel L. Jackson has a work problem -- an overwork problem to be precise. The man makes so many movies that half of them are bound to stink and even that percentage may be generous. That brings us to ""Formula 51"" a raucous violent comedy about a man who invents the ultimate party drug. Jackson wearing a wig of long tight dreads plays Elmo McElroy a kilt- wearing golf-fancying chemist who develops P.O.S. 51 a euphoria-inducing drug he calls ""a personal visit from God."" Having burned his stateside boss (Meat Loaf) Elmo flies to Liverpool for a 20 million score trailed by a professional hitter (Emily Mortimer) with a sniper rifle. Enter Felix (Robert Carlyle) a soccer-crazed expletive-spewing lackey who works for the local crime boss and hates Elmo on sight. Smell the franchise? Its the ""Rush Hour"" formula ludicrously mismatched thug and outsider trade insults jockey for power slam each others country. When Felix buys an order of greasy fish-and-chips for Elmo for example and calls it ""our national dish"" Elmo turns up his nose. ""More like a national disaster"" he spews and tosses the mess out a car window. Americans littering foreign soil is an ugly image but ""Formula 51"" couldnt care less about something as trivial as cultural respect. All the humor is hostile here -- all of it delivered with punched-up fist- in-your-face intensity. A gang of skinheads holds up Elmo calls him ""monkey boy"" and demands his wonder drug. So he feeds them a doctored concoction that makes them double over in agony and soil their pants. Poop jokes? Is that what Jackson one of the best actors around and executive producer of this movie has descended to? It isnt simple bad taste that ""Formula 51"" deals in but a total vacuum of feeling.

Though you can argue that this terrorist drama at least begins well the rest is so slow and murky that you can see why its only now hitting theaters two years after filming. Ratings of the two movies Heaven (out of four) Jonah A VeggieTales Movie As a bomb-wielder with a cause Blanchetts Brit in Italy plants an explosive device in the office of an electronics honcho who deals drugs to children (and did as well to her late husband). Instead of the target it kills four innocents in a tense scene and the rest of the story focuses on this contritely mortified prisoners budding relationship with a sympathetic young police officer (Giovanni Ribisi the overly emotional actor of The Gift The Other Sister). Hes the one who is translating her official statement for superiors who are likely on the take with drug money. Eventually a script co-written by the late Krzystof Kieslowski (The Decalogue) and directed by Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run) turns into a chase movie that willingly ignores suspense or even melodrama as its protagonist internalizes her guilt never an easy emotion to dramatize. Once the two flee to the countryside and sport shaven heads that further link them (as if their names Philippa and Filippo already hadnt) Heaven is saved only by the power of an occasional hypnotic image. At least a restrained Ribisi convinces as an Italian though if ever a movie needed one of the actors whiny jags to pump it up this has to be among the rare ones. (In New York and Los Angeles; R scene of sexuality) --Mike Clark Jonah A VeggieTales Movie With our country on the cusp of war in the Middle East the compassionate message of a bunch of vegetables resonates more than one might suspect. Heres the first big-screen effort to grow from a successful animated video franchise that offers moral and religious lessons from singing and dancing veggies. (The computer animation looks fine but its no Disney or DreamWorks.) The religious component in Jonah is substantial but not excessively didactic. Tunes range from Broadway to gospel and the comedy is funnier than might be expected from art that preaches. The cast of greens is headed by Old Testament prophet Jonah an asparagus who sports a monocle and plays croquet. (The filmmakers conceived the character as an homage to John Cleese.) Speaking of Cleese the Pirates Who Dont Do Anything an off-the-wall-bunch of characters that dont seem exactly biblical are a less amusing CGI version of Monty Pythonand the Holy Grails knights. The under-10 set should enjoy Jonahs characters particularly the main comic relief Khalil a flying-carpet and plush-toy salesman with an inferiority complex. (""My mother was a caterpillar my father was a worm but Im OK with that now"" he says.) The main lessons Jonah attempts to teach are compassion and mercy. Thats an unusual -- and welcome -- message these days.

"FX goes beyond the basics | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeTVNews FX goes beyond the basics Denise Martin 0 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr March 6 2005 | 0500AM PT Despite threat of indecency legislation cabler adds more edgy fare to slate Its not a secret anymore FX is trying to be basic cables HBO. Cabler last week picked up original dramas from Steven Bochco and Gavin Polone. Projects -- a war drama set in modern-day Iraq and a heist skein starring Andre Braugher -- give FX five original hour-longs. Thats more than any other ad-supported cable network. With the threat of indecency legislation looming over cable FX known for its gritty portrayals of contemporary urban life is venturing into dangerous territory. Media buyers call it a double-edged sword ""Theyve got the shows people are buzzing about but they cant get skittish advertisers to buy in"" says Laura Caraccioli-Davis senior VP and director for media buying firm Starcom. But thats OK with entertainment prexy John Landgraf. In the year hes been onboard Landgraf has won the blessing of News Corp. prexy Peter Chernin and Fox Cable Networks topper Tony Vinciquerra to program FX as if it were a premium destination. He says major advertisers long ago warmed up to that positioning. ""The new season of The Shield is sold out. You cant buy time on the show anymore"" he offers proof that FX has found a place for edgier fare. And theyre broadening the palette. Glenn Close embarks on her first series regular gig in ""The Shield"" next week. On tap for the summer are a pair of half-hour comedies -- rarely successful on cable -- aimed squarely at FXs sophisticated adult aud. And queuing up in the pipeline is a provocative doc series from Sundance winner Morgan Spurlock and an ambitious 10-hour interpretation of the Ten Commandments from George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh. With critical recognition and a rep for risk-taking t FX has gotten the big names to forego their usual rates and has everyone else lining up to work with them. Now that theyve invested in dramas comedies and reality Landgraf hopes to levy those originals for broadcast-sized ad rates. ""We want to dominate. We want to be a leader of original programmer in all of television broadcast cable and premium"" he says. Kagan Research estimates that FX spent 275 million on programming last year but received 485 million from advertisers and affiliates. FX shows boast some of the highest 18-49 numbers on basic cable with concentrations not even the larger general entertainment cablers can claim. ""People who watch FX more than likely have a number of desirable attributes. Theyre young. Theyre early adapters. Theyre trend-setters. But theyre also characteristically hard to reach"" a media analyst says. But with its premium cabler tone and positioning comes a price. As it stands now cable nets account for just 30% of TV ad dollars. ""Theyve got all this critical acclaim and the stories theyre telling are fantastic. But in taking up that HBO niche theyve probably closed some advertising categories that bring in major dollars"" she says. ""If they cant generate enough revenue with all this new programming my concern is how they will be able to sustain the business model theyve set up."" But Landgraf says hes taken care to be fiscally prudent. Heist hour ""Thief"" will get just a six-episode run for its first cycle. And both frosh comedies -- one about friends with eating disorders and the other about friends who own a bar -- are low-budget with just seven-seg commitments. ""I knew to pursue all over those challenges and opportunities we had to find a way to do things less expensively"" he says. ""Should we renew these shows itll likely be for longer stretches."" Its risky but Starcoms Caraccioli-Davis says FX could benefit from a large number of shows. Because their concentration of young men is so high ad categories that rely on those men -- movies beer videogames -- cant afford not to buy FX. ""Those advertisers have more leeway and are less sensitive to content"" she says but adds softer categories such as packaged goods eventually become necessary to reach bigger bucks. But FX execs say all in due time. Landgraf claims their originals command some of the highest-priced spots in cable though media buyers say they dont approach shows on the Big Six just yet.
