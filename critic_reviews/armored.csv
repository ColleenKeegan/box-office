What distinguishes this robbery-gone-wrong flick is the authentically blue-collar vibe as well as its stellar ensemble cast (Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne also appear) and terrific direction from Nimrod Antal whose last film Vacancy (2007) was his first in Hollywood after his well-regarded Hungarian debut Kontroll (2003). The film ultimately grants too much of an easy out to Hackett who has a crisis of conscience after things take a bloody turn. But Antal and his performers pure B-movie esprit is undeniable.

"Armored - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMOVIE REVIEW ArmoredA group of security guards plan a bank heist in a well-executed B movie.December 05 2009|By Glenn Whipp From left Jean Reno Matt Dillon and Laurence Fishburne star in this action-thriller. (Lacey Terrell / Screen Gems )""Nobody gets hurt . . . no bad guys just good guys"" Matt Dillons scheming security guard tells a recruit in ""Armored"" a solid heist flick elevated by its ensemble cast and the visual eye of Hungarian-born director Nimrod Antal (""Kontroll""). Naturally in the best B-movie tradition the guards assessment of things doesnt work out quite as planned. People get hurt and some of the good guys arent so good after all when a 42-million payday enters the picture. Youd think more than one of these guys would have the presence to ask Whats a little money between friends? The comrades in question are six stubble-sporting tough guys working for Los Angeles-based Eagle Shield Security. Dillon is Cochrane the man with the plan and godfather to Hackett (Columbus Short) a decorated young vet just back from Iraq and facing foreclosure on his dilapidated home. Cochrane tells Hackett about a bunch of armored car guards who faked a heist and kept the cash. In his mind the only mistake they made was not taking enough. Cochrane and his crew members -- played by Laurence Fishburne Jean Reno Skeet Ulrich and Amaury Nolasco -- dont plan on coming up short but they need Hackett on board. The particulars of their plan are a little fuzzy but first-time screenwriter James V. Simpsons screenplay contains a couple of satisfying surprises as well as a refreshing appreciation for honorable people trying to do the right thing something of a rarity for this genre. (Theres also a nice nod to ""Hill Street Blues"" delivered by Fred Wards security supervisor.) Antal rightly won praise for his creative camera work in his 2005 comic thriller ""Kontroll"" but his disciplined approach works well here too. Antals sophomore effort ""Vacancy"" showed he had a knack for making the most out of tight spaces and since much of ""Armored"" takes place inside its thick-plated trucks hes the right man for the material. ""Armored"" wont win any prizes but it does offer comforting evidence that theres still room for a well-crafted B movie among CG-laden spectacles. Only Robert Zemeckis Scrooge could cry humbug at this movies modest pleasures. calendarlatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESAt The MoviesOctober 29 2009Guard Sought in Armored Car HeistOctober 7 1997A Growing Arsenal Aimed at Stopping the CriminalsApril 25 1993MORE STORIES ABOUTEntertainmentHeistCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-etw-armored4-2009dec05,0,5098231.story",200,armored1,armored,latimes

Comments click to enlarge Armored Video Rated PG-13  2009 Matt Dillon leads an ostensibly close-knit crew of armored truck guards collaborating on an inside job. Their simple plan turns to shit when one conspirator (Columbus Short) develops a conscience mid-heist; after that the movie oscillates between Die Hard-inside-a-locked-truck and Die Hard-in-a-derelict-steel-plant. This unambitious caper flick takes a while to get moving but gradually develops a modest meat-and-potatoes appeal compromised in the third act by a whopping and perfectly avoidable plot hole. Make what you will of the fact that the good guy is an Iraq war vet and his straight-arrow superior (Fred Ward) is named Ashcroft. Nimrod Antal (Kontroll) directed; with Laurence Fishburne Jean Reno and Skeet Ulrich. PG-13 88 min.

For the expanded form theyve crafted a twisting tale of betrayal in which the terms and limits of both friendship and marriage are tested. Julian (Mike Vogel) is sitting in a bathtub when he receives a phone call from his BFF Terry (Danny Pino) whos in a hotel room directly across from the one where Terrys wife June (Brittany Murphy) has checked in presumably to meet another man. Emotionally unhinged and waving a gun Terry agrees to hold tight until Julian can meet him. Things of course go horribly awry. The third act is wonderfully tense although many of the flashback-heavy plot twists are predictable. The bigger problem is that the first act is full of such plodding line readings (everyone seems to have been directed to speak with maddeningly pregnant pauses) and mannered performances -- remember when Brittany Murphy was a delightfully natural screen presence? -- that the effect is to distance viewers from whats happening onscreen. Merkin tries too hard for stylistic flourishes (as the hyper set-designed claustrophobically seedy hotel underscores) and winds up almost sinking the noir-ish tale hes telling. (Music Hall) (Ernest Hardy) A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - ARMORED A crew of working-stiff armored truck personnel decide to lift their own payload with a heist plan that no one would ever attempt outside a first-draft screenplay. Dramatis personae are introduced picking up their ID tag personalities so that you can care when theyre eventually in harms way. (Milo Ventimiglias cop informs you that he has a dad; Amaury Nolascos gets a ribbing for his Bible.) The camaraderie in the Eagle Shield Transport locker room is strained stuff despite a capable ensemble cast that includes Matt Dillon and Larry Fishburne -- and Jean Renos sore-thumb presence as ""Quinn"" an obvious bid for Euros. Director Nimrod Antal shows the same weakness for augmenting action with swaggering beats that marked his debut Kontroll (per Dillons character ""It looks like youre overcompensating"") but he settles in once arrived at the films set-piece destination In a gutted factory to divvy up the money -- Armored gives a good tour of industrial L.A. -- a stand-off results when the new guy on the crew (thats former dancer-choreographer Columbus Short) gets an attack of conscience. Antal is never much beyond serviceable here but he does make a chase-duel between two entirely identical armored cars almost decipherable which is no mean feat. (Citywide) (Nick Pinkerton)BREAKING POINT Youd figure by this point in cinematic history that thered already be a low-rent crime thriller starring Tom Berenger and Armand Assante titled Breaking Point. But no that honor goes to this anonymously gritty New York drama about Steven Luisi (Berenger) a disgraced former assistant district attorney and recovering addict seeking redemption by defending an accused murderer. Luisis path to clearing his clients name leads him to a dangerous thug (rapper Busta Rhymes) and the crimes sole witness (Kirk ""Sticky Fingaz"" Jones) who is also the thugs onetime henchman and latest target. Corrupt public officials ghetto kids dreaming of a better life a flawed hero with a dead daughter on his conscience -- there isnt any cliche that writer Vincent Campanella and director Jeff Celentano dont treat with stoic reverence. From one perspective you could say that Breaking Point never steps wrong since its every movement is perfectly (almost comfortingly) predictable. But between Assantes tough-guy ADA with something to hide and Berengers squinty-eyed inner torment Breaking Point is so dry you may wish it had the good sense to be a campy hoot. The one bright spot is Rhymes convincingly scummy performance -- all of 50 Cents future gangster roles should be reassigned to him. (Sunset 5; Fallbrook 7) (Tim Grierson)BROTHERS Jim Sheridans remake of Danish director Susanne Biers 2005 film about the familial and psychic trauma caused by Operation Enduring Freedom feels like Operation Endurance. Marine captain and stalwart head-of-household Sam (Tobey Maguire) married to his high school sweetheart Grace (Natalie Portman) and proud pop of two adorable daughters returns to Afghanistan for a fourth tour of duty just a few days after Tommy (Jake Gyllenhaal) his no-good kid brother leaves the pokey. Thought dead after his helicopter crashes Sam survives and is held captive by the Taliban (torture by radical Sunni Muslims has become a specialty of screenwriter David Benioff who wrote the adaptation of 2007s The Kite Runner). Tommy mans up ice-skates with his nieces renovates his sister-in-laws kitchen and gives her a smooch. Sam returns home (New Mexico does double duty as Anonymous Small Town USA and Afghanistan) looking and acting more and more like Travis Bickle. Sheridan repeatedly drawn to family sagas including his own (2002s In America which also featured two cutie-pie little girls) aims for Greek tragedy but ends up with a PTSD melodrama with Maguire able to produce slobber almost as effortlessly as Portman can summon up tears -- essentially all her role calls for.

Sep. 13 600pm EVERYBODYS FINE Dont be misled by the cheesy generic poster for Kirk Jones retelling of Giuseppe Tornatores Stanno tutti bene in which a grinning Sam Rockwell Drew Barrymore and Kate Beckinsale pose with Robert De Niro for their characters family photo in front of a Christmas tree. Its a marketing departments feeble feint The four actors appear onscreen together for only a handful of minutes late in the movie and its no more a Christmas movie than Yentl was. De Niro takes on the role originally played by Marcello Mastroianni the father who surprise-visits his grown children who couldnt make it home for a family reunion. But De Niro whose deadpan is intended to signify emptiness and ache looks mostly like a somebody doing nothing; Mastroiannis mustache worked harder than De Niro does here. The visits with his kids are equally inconsequential. So whats the point of all of this road-tripping to nowhere? That parents best intentions often get the better of their children? Sons and daughters keep secrets from their parents? Fathers with blinders on can only pretend to know best? Its awfully hard to remake Tornatore and Alexander Paynes About Schmidt at the same time? Robert De Niros only good at playing a dad in movies starring Ben Stiller? Its all so much raging bull. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky)FIFTY DEAD MEN WALKING Canadian writer-director Kari Skoglands slick soapy procedural -- an unreliable adaptation of former IRA informant Martin McGartlands best-selling memoir -- again proves how easy it is to shamelessly bilk audiences of their empathy with an ""inspired by true events"" credit. McGartland himself still in hiding publicly claimed that the film is ""as near to the truth as Earth is to Pluto."" From off the violent streets of Northern Ireland during the late-80s peak of the Troubles cocky Belfast hoodlum Martin (Jim Sturgess) is recruited by British Special Branch officer Fergus (Sir Ben Kingsley) to infiltrate the IRA. Unable to tell even his trigger-happy mate (Kevin Zegers) or pregnant girlfriend (Natalie Press) of his thorny situation Martin is pulled dangerously under the spell of both his new extremist family and his avuncular handler. The private jousting sessions between Sturgess and Kingsley are easily the most compelling moments though its the younger actors convincing desperation that pretty much carries the film. The unfitting flashiness and clunky segues between thriller and melodrama kill any real sense of tension making this a poor mans Donnie Brasco -- that is if its self-congratulation and failure to contextualize the values on both sides of the ethno-political struggle didnt already make it the poor mans Hunger. (Music Hall) (Aaron Hillis)THE LAST STATION Opening with balalaikas scurrying agrarians in collarless shirts and helpful intertitles announcing that Tolstoy was ""the most celebrated writer in the world"" The Last Station threatens at first to be Tolstoy for Dummies as interpreted by Monty Python. Soon enough though this workmanlike adaptation of Jay Parinis novel about Tolstoys last days adapted and directed by Michael Hoffman settles into a lushly scenic television drama though with dialogue strangely located somewhere in the 1950s. The deal is that old Leo (a suitably grumpy Christopher Plummer) was not nearly as Tolstoyan as his adoring acolytes Neither veggie nor monk he was rich as Croesus and a randy old geezer. Whats more he fought a love-hate war with his bipolar wife Sonya and thank God for that since it allows Helen Mirren basically playing a cross between Ibsen drama queen Hedda Gabler and the little squirrel from A Dolls House to waltz away with the movie. James McAvoy is hopelessly miscast as the naive private secretary who is caught in a war between Sonya Leo and the savvy image-maker Chertkov (Paul Giamatti) over who will get the copyright to Tolstoys work -- his family or Mother Russia. The movie is fine but my heart only stopped for the actual footage at the end with Tolstoy encircled by Sonya and entourage being shown to his deathbed after flying the coop to get a little peace. (The Landmark) (Ella Taylor)SERIOUS MOONLIGHT Timothy Hutton is duct-taped to the potty and Meg Ryan is just plain potty in this posthumously produced Adrienne Shelly script directed by first-timer Cheryl Hines (who starred in Shellys Waitress in between Curb Your Enthusiasm seasons). Born of the grief-fueled determination of Shellys husband Andy Ostroy to carry on the legacy of his late wife who had completed several screenplays by the time of her murder in 2006 Serious Moonlight has a backstory much more intriguingly dramatic than whats onscreen. When alpha attorney Louise (Ryan) discovers that Ian (Hutton) her husband of 13 years is about to leave her for 24-year-old receptionist Sara (Kristen Bell) she trusses him up on the toilet of their country house holding him hostage until he falls in love with her again. Ryan flails and Hutton screams through the powder-room tears and recriminations performing as if theyre doing dinner theater underwritten by Dr. Phil. The tonally weird black comedy throws in some Funny Games -- and creepily echoes the circumstances surrounding Shellys murder by a construction worker who broke into her office to rob her -- when Justin Longs local gardener shows up to burglarize the house roughing up Ian and feeling up Louise. (Sunset 5) (Melissa Anderson) THE STRIP Could Dave Foley prostitute his talent to amuse any further without actually becoming a prostitute? In a plunging step down from emceeing celebrity poker Foley provides a recognizable face to Jameel Khans picked-over Goodwill bin of workplace comedy The Strip. Foleys Glenn is manager of a down-market Radio Shack-type store in a Chicago strip mall (the production design wouldve been truer had the rest of it been left untenanted). Many of the comic episodes are of the ""Okay um awkward whos this guy?"" avoiding-eye-contact reaction-shot variety prevalent in awful NBC sitcoms and television commercials geared toward 18- to 35-year-old white-collar workers as Glenn impresses weird teamwork exercises on his archetype employees Horny Loudmouth (""Shes got a bangability Level 9"") Foreign Guy Stubbly Slacker and Wasted Potential. Indifferently compiled Indie Hitz -- The Blow MGMT Peter Bjorn amp; John Band of Horses -- periodically fill the laughless silence that will prevail in any theater where this screens. The latter band accompanied the one funny scene where the stereotyped emotions reach bathetic boiling point as Wasted Potential and his hideously twee girlfriend run to the beach and throw their shoes in a lake intended to signify either transcendent liberation or extreme impracticality. (Sunset 5) (Nick Pinkerton)TRANSYLMANIA Humping the vampire trend straight-to-DVD director bros David and Scott Hillenbrand get some multiplex action by shoehorning their usual teen-sex farce into a hoary Draxploitation spoof. Wont audiences be confused if they havent followed the antics of these wasted college kids from National Lampoons Dorm Daze 1 and 2? Franchise schmanchise -- were all gonna get laid Spending a semester abroad in a Romanian castle that doubles as a rave-ready campus the usual gaggle of horny losers potheads sluts and ""brainy ones"" get loaded with silicone-enhanced vamps a pint-size dean hiding a diabolical scheme to fix his daughters humpback and all the filthy sleazy locals with ridiculous accents you can stomach. The jokes are mainly of the slamming-your-dick-in-a-laptop variety -- think Porkys with 00s references -- and predictable innuendos about biting and sucking. There is however something surprisingly old-timey about the perfunctory screwball plot points When a demonic music box is opened a reawakened sorceress possesses a busty cheerleader; a fratty blowhard is forced to become a vampire hunter after pretending to be one; and the evil Count is an undead ringer for the lead virgin. With stronger actors and real writers this mightve been a vintage comedy you could sink your...nope not going there.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Theres a funny throwaway gag on The Simpsons in which a theater marquee is emblazoned with the words ""MOVIE WITH AIR CONDITIONING."" Armored is the prototypical movie with air conditioning a 90-minute slot-filler so simple generic and blandly proficient that the reels might as well come delivered in a brown paper sack. Theres nothing wrong with a tight little genre film that efficiently delivers the goods; in fact Nimrod Antals last effort the underrated motel-hell thriller Vacancy did exactly that exploiting a single location to maximum effect. Armored also takes place largely in one place--an abandoned warehouse where duplicitous guards for an armored-truck company hole up after a botched heist--but it lacks that extra layer or two to make it interesting. The script and direction is all bones no flesh. Leading a cast flush with squandered character actors Columbus Short stars as the new guy at an armored-truck company trying to scrape together enough money to keep his home and retain guardianship over his troubled younger brother. His situation is just desperate enough for his veteran co-workers--Matt Dillon Laurence Fishburne Jean Reno Skeet Ulrich and Amaury Nolasco--to rope him into a robbery scheme involving two trucks containing 42 million. When the plan goes kaflooey and things get violent Short locks himself inside one of the trucks and tries to get help for himself and wounded cop Milo Ventimiglia who affirms his reputation as the second most boring hero on Heroes. For nearly half of Armored Short is inside the truck while the others try to break into it by hammering out the hinges with a large hunk of steel. (Pity the poor men who have to hold the thin metal spike to poke the hinge out who get their fingers crushed more than once.) This abandons Fishburne--an actor of considerably higher caliber than this role requires--to spend the majority of his screen time thrusting his arms downward and grunting albeit with the subtle variation of snowflakes. Its a film without twists where everything is what it seems and when the mess has been resolved its even at a loss for a proper denouement. Armored just ends--and with it so does the access to plush chairs and free air conditioning.

(Lacey Terrell) Joe Neumaier Friday December 4 2009 345 PM Title Armored It took a while for someone to finally make a variation on ""Reservoir Dogs"" and as that ""Armored"" actually finds a way to work some nail-biting tension into the proceedings. It isnt bulletproof by a long shot but director Nimrod Antals grungy gang-of-thieves pic is tough and for this genre surprisingly ethical.Matt Dillon is Cochrone the leader of six security guards entrusted with transporting huge amounts of cash from banks. As a new member Hackett (Columbus Short) joins them Cochrone tells tales of hijacking jobs gone bad. The big mistake he seems to think is that the guys doing the hijacking didnt think big enough.So Cochrone comes up with a plan to take the payloads from the trucks during one especially high-dollar-sign transport run. He needs all six guys on board though -- and when Hackett objects to the ruthless measures taken when he was promised thered be no victims he tries to opt out.But his fellow guards stop him and Hackett finds himself locked inside one of the armored trucks with only a short amount of time to go before Cochrone Baines (a weighty Laurence Fishburne) and the others find a way to get inside the impenetrable vehicle and stop Hackett from telling the cops.Antal (whose previous films ""Vacancy"" and ""Kontroll"" earned him a cult following) has a nice sense of the claustrophobic and he and cinematographer Andrzej Sekula (who also shot ""American Psycho"") give industrialized broken-down urban areas a shadowy gun-metal-blue tinge (the places these scruffy guards each of them bearded or five-oclock-shadowed hang is out is nowhere youd want to be). As Hackett is closed in on -- first in an abandoned factory then an armored truck and finally by his former comrades - things get more and more tense. The arrival of a wounded cop (""Heroes"" costar Milo Ventimiglia) only ups the stakes.Unfortunately most of the acting is of the grunt-shrug-and-bark variety (Jean Reno Skeet Ulrich and Amaury Nolasco round out this wild bunch) and theres even a gruff captain (Fred Ward) who gives ""Hill Street Blues""-like admonitions to be careful out there. But the actors drowning in testosterone and adrenaline have themselves a real time and Hackett is a kind of guy not found often in gritty action thrillers. Trying to keep the house he and his younger brother live in Hackett rejects the lure of ill-gotten gains and quietly unassumingly stays true to his own moral compass. And ""Armored"" has the guts to reward the character for it payback essentially for his rejecting the wages of fear.

Simpson; Release Date Wide 12/04/2009 Posted December 2 2009 -- 1200 AM EST In this blue-collar actioner Columbus Short plays an impoverished soldier-turned-security guard worried about losing both his house and custody of his teenage brother (Andre Kinney). So when a colleague (Matt Dillon) suggests that they rip off the 40 million they?re supposed to be protecting with fellow rent-a-cops (Jean Reno Skeet Ulrich Laurence Fishburne and Amaury Nolasco) he reluctantly goes along. Does everything go according to plan? No and Short spends most of the movie scuttling in and out of an armored truck while trying to save the life of Milo Ventimiglia?s cop character. Did writer James V. Simpson have any grand ambitions for the film? Possibly Ulrich?s character shares a name with Humphrey Bogart?s luckless gold prospector in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Alas Armored is one predictable and forgettable movie that should consider itself very lucky not to have gone straight to DVD. On the positive side director Nimrod Antal -- who made the grimly wonderful 2003 Hungarian movie Kontroll and is overseeing the forthcoming Predator reboot -- pushes the bulk of the film along with a muscular efficiency. And this Die Hard-in-a-security-truck movie is at least less ludicrous than Ulrich?s previous Speed-in-an-ice-cream-truck fiasco Chill Factor.

A so-so heist-gone-awry thriller thats light on the thrills ""Armored"" doesnt exactly take its audience captive. As a crew of money-hungry armored truck drivers scheming to snatch a fortune in federal reserve notes a colorful cast including Matt Dillon Jean Reno Laurence Fishburne and Skeet Ulrich is allowed to ham it up in promising early scenes before being made limply subordinate to the tedious cracking-under-pressure narrative. Screen Gems release sans press screenings or strongly bankable stars wont steal much more than a pittance at the holiday season B.O. Relative newcomer Columbus Short capably takes the lead as young Ty Hackett a decorated Iraq war vet and recently hired member of Californias Eagle Shield Security. His parents deceased and his bank account dangerously low Ty lives in a rundown house with his younger brother Jimmy (Andre Jamal Kinney) a graffiti artist who might as well have the word ""hostage"" spray-painted on his forehead. Unable to secure extra shifts from Eagle Shield boss Ashcroft (Fred Ward) Ty is vulnerable to increasingly strong persuasion from tough-guy co-worker Mike Cochrane (Dillon) that the armored transport crew ought to pull an inside job when the time is right. Refreshing at first director Nimrod Antals unfashionably measured pacing begins to grate after too many scenes that travel slowly to familiar destinations. James V. Simpsons verbose screenplay ridiculously overstates Tys temptation to turn criminal particularly in a laughable passage that has an elderly social worker stopping by the house after dark threatening to separate high schooler Jimmy from his older brother. Initially Ty goes along when Mike and four other Eagle Shield workers hijack the transfer of 42 million in crisp bank notes the crew pulling a pair of armored trucks into a dilapidated warehouse where they plan to hide the stash. But Tys conscience nags particularly once things -- surprise -- fail to proceed as planned. An unremarkable car chase notwithstanding ""Armored"" allows Antal to continue his tradition -- begun in ""Kontroll"" and ""Vacancy"" -- of setting action within confined areas. But the directors spatial inventiveness falls short here as the films overextended warehouse business has remorseful Ty taking refuge in one of the vehicles for far too much of the brief running time. The movie especially strains credulity when it comes time for Antal to show that those state-of-the-art trucks arent impenetrable after all. As one-dimensionally ruthless thieves Dillon and Fishburne have too little to do with Ulrich and Reno faring little better. Tech credits are merely adequate with the exception of ""Pulp Fiction"" d.p. Andrzej Sekulas sharp shooting in widescreen.
