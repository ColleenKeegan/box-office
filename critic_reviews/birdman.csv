ATSUSHI NISHIJIMA  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS BY JOCELYN NOVECK / THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF BirdmanStarring Michael Keaton Emma Stone Edward Norton Naomi Watts Andrea Riseborough Zach Galifianakis Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Rated R for language throughout some sexual content and brief violence Running time 1 hour 59 minutesThe quick hitMichael Keaton offers a dark fascinating portrayal of a washed-up Hollywood star known for superhero roles who is pushed to the brink after he puts everything he has into a bid for Broadway success. Grade A- When we first see Michael Keaton in ""Birdman"" Alejandro G. Inarritus bracingly inventive and accomplished new film about fame relevance self-worth and lots of other intense stuff hes sitting in his white undies in the middle of a dressing room. No really in the middle. Like in the air. Hes levitating. Of course you think ""Howd he DO that?"" Turns out thats an apt metaphor intentional or not for Inarritus entire achievement here. Fast forward to films end and well bet the very same words will be on your lips ""Howd they DO that?"" Still its best not to spend too much time thinking about the technical virtuosity of ""Birdman"" most importantly how it creates the impression thanks to master cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki that its all one continuous shot. Keaton in a wonderfully raw dark and vulnerable performance plays aging actor Riggan Thomson who earned fame and wealth decades ago playing a superhero Birdman. His fans want more; hes moved on. (Any parallels here with Keaton star of two ""Batman"" films a quarter-century ago are purely intentional.) In a bid to restore his sense of self-worth and perhaps to exorcise the demon of Birdman Riggan is putting on a show. Its a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver tale which Riggan himself has written is starring in and directing. Your basic movie-star vanity project only you get the sense Riggans very life - or at least his sanity - depends on it. The fodder for industry jokes is endless. When a key actor is suddenly incapacitated Riggan ponders possible replacements with his friend and attorney Jake (Zach Galifianakis exercising admirable comic restraint). Woody Harrelson? Hes doing the next ""Hunger Games."" Robert Downey Jr.? Nah ""Avengers."" That other guy? Hes doing the prequel to the prequel. Luck strikes like a thunderbolt when Mike Shiner (Edward Norton superb) shows up to read for the part. Mike may be an entitled jerk but hes a bankable star. The scenes between Keaton and Norton as they rehearse compete and occasionally brawl like testosterone-fueled youngsters are simply dynamite two actors firing on all cylinders. Then theres Sam Riggans daughter fresh from rehab and working as Dads assistant. Its fun to see Emma Stone play a more troubled unstable character here; her eyeliner-rimmed eyes seem to contain both love and loathing for her father. Looming over everything is opening night when one particular theater critic will with the strike of a pen make or break the show the acid-tongued Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan) who despises Riggan and his movie-star ilk for polluting the theater. ""I will destroy your play"" she hisses to him acknowledging that she doesnt even plan to see it first. ""Birdman"" more than most seems a film that deserves a second viewing not only to admire the work of Keaton and his co-stars but to delve into its many layers.

Its not the last time well see Keaton playing a fallen Hollywood star named Riggan Thompson who is trying to make a comeback in an ambitious Broadway play in his underwear. Riggan becomes a ""viral sensation"" later in ""Birdman"" -- more famous than at any time since his run as the star of the eponymous superhero franchise two decades earlier - thanks to a nightmarish episode where he gets locked out of his own theater and must weave his way through the tourist-packed streets of Times Square similarly attired. Its also not the last time well see him defy the laws of physics which Inarritu sees (Im afraid) as a metaphor for what artists do all the time even those as conflicted and compromised as Riggan.In some ways ""Birdman"" seems like a major departure for Inarritu the immensely talented and too often achingly earnest director of ""Biutiful"" and ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams."" (And of course his blistering debut film ""Amores Perros"" still the best thing hes ever done.) Its an overtly comic film an exaggerated backstage satire made entirely in English and shot on location in New York. Riggans dramatic adaptation of Raymond Carvers ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" - an intentionally dreadful idea - is staged in and around the real St. James Theatre on 44th Street a legendary Broadway house that has hosted major theatrical premieres from ""Oklahoma"" to ""Tommy"" to ""American Idiot."" But beneath its arch farcical and fanciful surface its accelerated dialogue and its amped-up showbiz characters ""Birdman"" is still an Inarritu film. Its a quasi-religious fable about a man haunted by the past and facing a profound moral and existential crisis in the present and its a dazzling display of virtuoso cinematic technique and showboat performances. In structural and moral terms in fact it tells almost exactly the same story as ""Biutiful"" which starred Javier Bardem as a divorced dying Barcelona dad with a terrible secret and wasnt funny at all.What all the crackle and hilarity and daredevil Scorsese-style long takes down corridors around corners up staircases and across rooftops add up to Im honestly not sure. Let me mention Martin Scorsese again just to make sure you get the point. To make this movie it feels like Inarritu and ace cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki cooked ""Taxi Driver"" ""After Hours"" and ""The King of Comedy"" down into crystals of crack cocaine and smoked them up before downing a few shots distilled from Fellinis ""8-1/2."" For most of the way - lets say nearly all the way - the ride in ""Birdman"" is so thrilling youll never wonder what the point is because the ride itself is the point. This movie has Zach Galifianakis totally killing it in a role Zach Galifianakis would never play as Riggans uptight and neatly styled manager. It has Emma Stone and Edward Norton playing ""Truth or Dare"" on a rooftop overlooking Times Square. It features an all-percussion score improvised by drummer Antonio Sanchez - who occasionally appears in the film playing along - and a homeless man offering a distinctive reading of the ""Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"" monologue from ""Macbeth.""No one can watch this movie and not feel the genuine struggle and genuine excitement within it. Of course its no accident that the tormented central character is played by a 63-year-old actor who once eons ago in Hollywood time wore the cape and mask of the most iconic superhero of all. But if Michael Keaton displays a fervent intensity and emotional range here that he never got close to showing before during or after his Batman stardom ""Birdman"" is not Keatons story or his cri de coeur. Written in a group collaboration by Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo ""Birdman"" is both an indictment of the Hollywood production machine and a self-indictment of the vanity and narcissism so often found in those who try to resist it. Inarritu is not kidding even a little bit about the argument that superhero films are fascistic and soul-destroying. At the same time he feels himself being sucked in just as noble warriors of old were corrupted by the One Ring. I half-suspect he made this movie to inoculate himself against their immense commercial and cultural allure and to make studios stop sending him those scripts. (It wont necessarily work.) You Might Also Like From the preening bad-boy method actor hilariously played by Edward Norton to the embittered martini-swilling New York Times critic played by Lindsay Duncan Riggan is surrounded by people eager to tell him hes a worthless hack. Duncan is more like a caricature of a mean-spirited and judgmental critic than the real thing but thats because most theater critics in the real world would be slavishly eager to wash the feet of a slumming Hollywood celeb. Riggan also has his adult daughter Sam (Emma Stone) who is just out of rehab his semi-forgiving ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan) and his younger girlfriend and on-stage co-star Laura (Andrea Riseborough) to remind him that his personal life is a disaster. At the same time Riggan is driven on by the voice of Birdman his onetime alter ego assuring him that his true destiny is greatness far beyond these pretentious theater losers and that billion-dollar worldwide grosses can once again be his. At least at first Birdman is just a voice; if youve seen any promotional material for this movie its no spoiler to say that ultimately he makes a spectacular personal appearance to drive his point home.Most of the fun in ""Birdman"" is basic cinematic pleasure the fun of pinballing around the St. James with Riggan as he bounces off his cast his family members and his support staff without quite registering them as human beings. If Stone Galifianakis and especially Norton - playing precisely the kind of egomaniacal and unpredictable great actor that Ed Norton is presumed to be - make the biggest impression Riseborough Ryan and Naomi Watts (as a character actor finally getting her Broadway break) also get showcase moments. It is never even remotely convincing that the Carver short story in question could be turned into a Broadway show not even by someone with Riggans evident personality disorder and the more we see of this godawful play the more uncomfortable it becomes. Like Are these really the two alternatives left in our culture Michael Keaton in a bad wig doing imitation Eugene ONeill or ever more arcane and pseudo-operatic effluvia of the Marvel and DC universes? If I had to choose between them at gunpoint I might ask for the gun. As for the plot twist or the double reversal or whatever it is that comes toward the end of the film Im dying to debate that but of course I wont except to say that its completely misguided and makes ""Birdman"" feel like an immensely ambitious gimmick that finally crashes to earth. I think the movie is far more interesting more daring and more deeply confused than its dopey magic-realist escape valve. It is a work devoured by its own ambition consumed by the very thing it vilifies. Its obvious Oscar bait - a mid-budget showbiz satire loaded with stars - that decries the Oscar process in the words of Hunters critic character as a bunch of vain and empty people giving each other awards for cartoons and pornography. (Thats not something an actual critic would ever say Oscar movies are often terrible but not in that precise way.) Its a work of sparkling witty entertainment that yearns to soar above all such things even though its hero and its creator both know how the Icarus story ends.""Birdman"" is now playing in New York and Los Angeles with national release to follow.

Its really that fresh. Michael Keaton -- wonderfully wired as always -- stars in this black comedy about celebrity and showbusiness. Hes Riggan Thomson a washed-up actor whose career needle got stuck on Birdman the caped crusader role he played a generation ago. (Sound familiar? Keaton was Batman twice more than 20 years ago.) Hoping to kick-start his career Riggan is starring in a Broadway play based on the vaguely depressing Raymond Carver story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love; Riggan is also directing. Certain things suggest that Riggan is wound very tight and is possibly a tad delusional. We see him levitating for example and he seems to have telekinetic powers. He also seems to have a special relationship with coincidence. Its as if he operates on a slightly different level than everyone else. The core of the tale is his effort to win something back some elusive sense of fame or power or youth and the endless frustration that meets him at every turn recalcitrant actors wardrobe issues ego problems hateful critics. And then theres that Birdman voice in his head that never stops berating him. When his mind takes flight it seems Riggan really can fly and because of the films technical brilliance the movement between reality and fantasy is absolutely seamless. This guy still has some superhero chops to show off. Generally speaking Birdman operates as a sort of cinematic trompe loeil. The first trick involves the meticulous technical work (bravo cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki last seen picking up his Oscar for Gravity) that makes the movie look as if it consists of one continuous take. That is something you really have to see to believe but the overall effect of it for the audience is the sense of being right in the middle of the story. Hand-in-glove with that goes a soundtrack that sounds like a nervous breakdown. Another bit of sleight-of-hand involves the casting which sees most of the main characters playing some heightened version of stock celebrity or their own public persona -- Keaton a former Batman at the height of his career is a past-his-glory-days character trying to make a comeback; Edward Norton is an egotistical pompous thespian who despises Hollywood; Emma Stone is an entitled young Hollywood brat fresh out of rehab with a special talent for cruel truths. The story has something to say about how comic book heroes have undermined whatever should be going on in the world omovies so theres a little inside joke in the fact that Keaton Norton and Stone have all had big roles in blockbuster superhero movies. The impressive cast also includes Naomi Watts Zach Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough. Finally what may be the most impressive bit of magic here is a screenplay that assumes the audience can keep up. Birdman is a great story filled with razor-sharp exchanges inside Hollywood jokes and clever observations. Its so grown up. Its so wound-up. Its so funny. Its so tense and claustrophobic and heartbreaking. Bring a little extra adrenalin along for this one. Birdman opens in Toronto and Vancouver Oct. 24. It will expand to other Canadian cities over the next two weeks. Twitter LizBraunSun liz.braunsunmedia.ca Readers comments >> By adding a comment on the site you accept our terms and conditions.

Us Weeklys film critic Mara Reinstein breaks down the five cant-miss fall movies to see before Katniss hits the big screen. Whiplash Daniel McFadden/Courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics 4 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters) Movies set in a Juilliard-like music school arent supposed to make your heart race in nervous anticipation. Yet thats exactly why this taut drama is one of the years best. Two Oscar-worthy virtuoso performances lead the way Miles Teller as an indefatigable jazz drummer who pounds the sticks until his fingers bleed and J.K. Simmons as his barbaric instructor. (Youll never think of the latter as the caring dad from Juno ever again.) With every syncopated beat the conductor pushes his star pupil to excellence -- and the brink of madness. Their relationship culminates in a staggering crescendo worthy of a standing ovation. The Theory of Everything Liam Daniel / Focus Features 3 1/2 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters) You may already know about the mathematician Stephen Hawkings beautiful mind. This stirring biopic focuses on his loving but bittersweet 25-year marriage. Surefire Oscar nominees Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones share terrific chemistry as the couple who try to overcome unshakable odds. Soon before their wedding Stephen is diagnosed with a neurological disease and is given two years to live. As his physical condition deteriorates he still has the amazing mental capacity to devise scientific theories and author 1988s A Brief History of Time. No doubt his life is extraordinarily inspiring -- and yet the drama rarely goes the sappy and sentimental route. (Heavy burdens are placed on his wife on a daily basis). Though the marriage eventual crumbles what a joy to see a relationship thats anything but formulaic. PHOTOS Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones hit the red carpet Birdman Twentieth Century Fox 3 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters) Twenty years after Michael Keaton last put on his Batman costume the actor gives a fearless nod to his-Caped Crusader career in a brazenly off-kilter comedy. Hes Riggan Thomson a former movie franchise star who tries to Go Serious by staging a dramatic Broadway play. Still despite his most valiant manic efforts -- and this is where Keaton really captivates -- Riggan cant shake his Birdman alter ego. Shot via a handheld camera in what appears to be one singular swooping take the film offers a blistering look at how an industry rat race can decimate a mans self-worth. (Emma Stone is sublime as his judgmental newly rehabbed daughter). As a snarky Hollywood takedown however its message -- art good Blockbusters bad -- is a bit pedestrian. PHOTOS Emma Stones best red carpet moments St. Vincent Atsushi Nishijima/Weinstein 3 stars (out of 4) (out now in theaters) The curmudgeon with at the heart of gold teaches a wide-eyed boy about life The story is more worn out than a pair of bowling shoes. But when Bill Murray is the one doling out the lessons resistance is futile. The actor brings wit and humanity to Vincent a crusty blue-collar Vietnam vet. His stagnancy is upended when a recent divorcee (Melissa McCarthy admirably toned down) and her 12-year-old son Oliver (Jaeden Lieberher) move in next door. She works crazy hours leaving Vince to become the kids babysitter. Soon he takes Oliver on field trips to the horse track the bar -- and aww the nursing home where he cares for his wife. Whats next a colorful Irish priest? A kindly prostitute? Check and check (Theyre played by Chris ODowd and Naomi Watts respectively).

The regression becomes complicated when she starts hooking up with the girls single and lonely dad (Sam Rockwell utterly appealing).

"Birdman (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Birdman (R) Michael Keaton comes back strong in this story about actors and their infinite foibles. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com10/30/2014 Editor rating 3.5 Birdman is a cacophonous daring movie about a washed-up actor who is giving his career one last chance by adapting Raymond Carvers short story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love for Broadway. Riggan (Michael Keaton) was once a famous box office draw for a series of superhero pictures about a character named Birdman. But he decided to stop wasting his time in commercial junk dig deep and become a ""serious"" performer. But much like what happened to Keaton in real life post-Batman the Oscar-caliber roles never came and after a series of box office duds and small supporting roles he fell off the map altogether. Riggan has everything riding on this play which he stars in and is also directing. But the production seems cursed such as a supporting actor (a hilarious Edward Norton) who believes in Method to ridiculous degrees (he refuses to read the script insisting on improvising all his lines and drinks real booze on the set). Riggans ex-wife (Amy Ryan) is furious that he refinanced their home to pay for the play. The plays first preview performance is an utter disaster and Riggan begins to lose his nerve. None of this describes the style and manner in which director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu who is not known for light fare (Babel Biutiful Amores Perros) has shot the film. Working with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who also shot last years Gravity) all of Birdman takes place in one uninterrupted take with hidden edits. Even though the story spans several days Inarritu refuses to let you outside Riggans increasingly jangled head (Keaton is in almost every scene). There is no exit here. The score is made up almost entirely of loud grating percussion (in one shot you can see the drummer playing the music in a room in the background). There are some huge laughs in Birdman although the humor takes a little getting used to and there are moments of great beauty and flights of sudden startling fantasy too. Keaton an actor whose best work has been overlooked by recent history is essentially playing three versions of himself The plays director/star (for which he wears a horrible wig) his dressing-room self (where he takes off the hairpiece and unleashes his anger and frustrations) and quieter moments where he talks to his imaginary comic-book alter-ego who keeps insisting he made a mistake by quitting the franchise. Birdman takes advantage of every facet of Keatons talent from his knack for absurdist comedy to his seemingly effortless ability to tap into graceful profundity without making a big show of it. Riggan is deeply damaged but hes also aware of it which adds to his desperation to make his play a hit. If not he knows he might slip over the edge and lose all hope forever. The movie -- the full title is Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) -- is Inarritus out-of-the-box salute to art creativity and mad genius and although some critics have misinterpreted the film as a self-indulgent mess the movies daring and goofiness lets you know the filmmaker is in on the joke. A scene in which Riggan confronts the New York Times theater critic who promises shes going to kill the show before shes even seen it is not meant to be taken as Inarritu pushing back again his haters; the scene is clearly and specifically only about Riggan not critics in general. What will mainstream audiences make of this odd-duck movie? I have no idea -- I predict equal numbers of walkouts and cheers -- but by taking us inside the nuts and bolts of a stage production showing us not only the main players but also the invisible people behind the scenes Inarritu celebrates the insane amount of work that goes into this profession (the movie could have easily been about a film too but the enclosed location of a play works better). Birdman is strange and original irritating and inspiring and it makes you think twice about writing off art you dont like as garbage just because it doesnt play to your tastes. As for the circulating claims that Inarritu is a pretentious fraud someone should call up Hitchcock Kubrick Spielberg and Scorsese and tell them to stop being so full of themselves and please make more generic movies thank you. When someone pours so much of their heart into such a risky project ""fraud"" is the last word that comes to mind. ""Courageous"" is the first.

Ad Block Plus Ghostery uBlock Other Blockers Back Please follow the steps below Text Size Christopher Orr Oct 24 2014 Culture A movie star who left millions on the table when he declined to reprise his lead role in a 1990s superhero sequel? You might reasonably guess that Im referring to Michael Keaton who turned down 15 million when he bailed on the Batman franchise during its (first) heyday. But no Im referring to Riggan Thomson who quit the role of the flying feather-clad crusader Birdman around the same time. The principal difference between the two is that unlike Keaton Riggan is a fictional character the protagonist in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus new film Birdman. And he is played not at all coincidentally by Michael Keaton.Nor is that the end of the superheroic in-jokes embedded in Inarritus gonzo tour-de-force black comedy. At times Riggan is literally haunted by his old Birdman role which speaks to him in a deep rasp (also performed by Keaton) conspicuously reminiscent of that of his Dark Knight successor Christian Bale. At one point in the film Riggan finds himself obsessing about George Clooney--yet another old Batman--and in particular about the square jaw that his bat-cowl showed off to notable effect.Related Story The Oscar Contenders to Emerge From the New York Film Festival After years of wallowing in post-stardom obscurity Riggan has decided that the best way to reintroduce himself to the world is to write direct and star in a loose arty Broadway adaptation of the Raymond Carver short story What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. But this is no easy task. Riggans most immediate problem is that just a few days before the shows premiere one of his costars is hospitalized after being hit during rehearsal by a  light falling from the rafters. With the help of his lawyer/producer/best friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis) Riggan runs down a list of possible replacements Michael Fassbender? On the hook for another X-Men. Jeremy Renner? Busy being an Avenger. Riggan who had the skies to himself back in his Birdman days quickly discovers that in contemporary Hollywood theres hardly an actor working who isnt working in lycra. So he opts to go in another direction hiring a renowned stage thespian named Mike Shiner. This crown prince of Broadway is naturally played by Edward Norton ... who just a few years back was the star of The Incredible Hulk.Given all these nods what is surprising about Birdman is that it is only peripherally a satire of the current superhero spate. Inarritus odd and ingenious film is far more interested in poking fun at the pretensions of New York theater the brittle actresses (the other costars of Riggans show are played by Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough); the overweening male egos (Riggans own and especially Mikes); the backstage romances; the clap-at-whatever-you-give-them audiences; and the poison-penned New York Times critic (Lindsay Duncan) eager to demonstrate how easily she can ""kill"" Riggans play with one vicious review. On top of these theatrical intrigues Riggan is also trying to be a better father to his recently rehabbed daughter Sam (Emma Stone) and something other than a self-involved jerk to his ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan).If that werent enough on his plate Riggan must contend with the possibility that he might actually be a superhero. When he hears that Birdman voice in his head he turns into a middle-aged-man version of Carrie White telekinetically spinning objects through space or hurling them into walls. Indeed when we first meet Riggan in his dingy dressing room he is levitating lotus-style in his tighty whiteys. Later well see him swoop across entire city blocks and blow up cars with a snap of his fingers. And that actor who needed replacing after being hit by a falling light? He was someone Riggan wanted to get rid of anyway. ""That wasnt an accident"" he confides to Jake. ""I did that.""Is Riggans body the vessel for some powerful extraterrestrial force? Is Riggans body the vessel for some powerful extraterrestrial force? (More than once we see a fiery meteor blazing across the sky.) Did he somehow absorb the energy of a thousand jellyfish stings? (This possibility is a little hard to explain briefly.) Or is Riggan merely losing his mind? That voice in his head the angry Bale-rasp of his former self does seem to carry more than a whiff of grandiose delusion. ""You tower over these other theater douchebags"" it growls. ""Youre a movie star.... You are a god.""Whether or not Riggan is in fact possessed of divine abilities--Inarritu offers contradictory clues along the way--Birdman puts on clear display the indisputable superpowers of its cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki. Forget the legendary Steadicam tracking shot into the nightclub in Goodfellas. Prepare to yawn at the glorious crane work in the opening of Touch of Evil. Even Lubezkis own spectacular sequences in Children of Men and Gravity cant prepare you for what he and Inarritu have cooked up here an entire feature film that appears to consist of one long continuous take. (It doesnt--careful viewers will spot seams here and there--but it is an astonishment nonetheless.) Unlike its clearest antecedent Hitchcocks faux single-take in 1948s Rope Birdman doesnt confine its action to a single studio set. Instead Lubezkis camera veers and swoops as it follows characters through the backstage warrens of Broadways St. James Theater (which resembles a shabbier subterranean version of Barton Finks Hotel Earle) onto the stage into the audience up on the roof out onto the streets of Times Square and upwards into the sky itself. Lubezki won his first Oscar last year for Gravity; with Birdman hes placing a very strong bid for a second.Befitting the errant bravura visuals Birdman is a film in which almost nothing is adequately tethered. Riggan is coming gradually unglued as we watch torn between ambition and exhaustion the potential glory of artistic success and the easier consolations found inside a whiskey bottle. (There are echoes of the fraying realities of the fictional directors played by Steve Buscemi in Living in Oblivion and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Synecdoche New York.) Members of Riggans cast and family pinball off of him--more often than not to restless drum riffs by Antonio Sanchez--but they rarely dent his narcissism. Even the film itself has a vaguely schizoid feel to it part sex farce part Broadway satire part magical-realist fable part rumination on celebrity in the age of social media.In the midst of this madness Keaton delivers a relatively subtle subdued performance. And while he carries the film admirably the role is nonetheless somewhat unsatisfying. Though Riggan is onscreen for the vast majority of the film large holes remain in the character. (Were given very little sense for instance of what hes been doing in the 20 years since his Birdman incarnation.) Its a vagueness that seems deliberately engineered In the climax of his play--of which we witness multiple iterations--Riggan laments that he is vanishing altogether. But however deliberate this hazy quality renders him remote more concept than character.The true stars of the movie are Inarritu and Lubezki who pack their film with dizzying style and verve.The same might be said of Nortons supporting role as Mike I suppose but the actor embodies him with such relish and dynamism that its hard to look away. A ball of furiously compressed Method artistry Mike insists on drinking real gin onstage and attempts to have actual sex with Watts in the midst of one performance. (Without an audience we discover he is rendered impotent.) His devout self-admiration and practiced contempt for Hollywood--""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige"" he lectures Riggan--are among the chief delights of the film. In addition to being the movies most magnetic performance Nortons role also serves as a self-deprecating joke about the actors own widespread reputation for uncompromising perfectionism. (It was this trait that reportedly led Marvel Studios not to invite him back to reprise his Hulkhood in The Avengers.)Galifianakis and Stone (especially) are both strong as Riggans business partner and daughter respectively. Watts Ryan and Riseborough take advantage of the limited opportunities afforded to them by the script (credited to Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo). And Duncan is terrific in the small (and moderately absurd) role of the Times critic Tabitha Dickinson. A giant of the contemporary stage she is an actress it would be nice to see onscreen more often.The true stars of the movie however are Inarritu and Lubezki who pack their film with dizzying (at times literally) style and verve. Whether theres much substance percolating below the surface is an open question--I tend to think not--but after the almost bullying profundities of Inarritus 21 Grams (which I liked nonetheless) and Babel (which I did not) this moral reticence comes almost as a relief. Birdman--I should probably note here that the full title is the punctuationally ridiculous Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)--is a giddy fantasia of themes and genres and if not all of them fully cohere then so be it. As the Birdman voice inside Riggans head reminds us sometimes viewers crave pure entertainment not just ""talky pretentious philosophical bullshit.""

Ive made no secret of why as a Republican I oppose Donald Trump and what he stands for. But Ive also been talking to his supporters and advisors trying to understand how they see and hear the same things that I do and draw such very different conclusions. What follows isnt a transcription--its a synthesis of the conversations Ive had and the insights Ive gleaned presented in the voice of an imagined Trump supporter. ""You people in the Acela corridor arent getting it. Again. You think Donald Trump is screwing up because he keeps saying things that you find offensive or off-the-wall. But hes not talking to you.

Donald Trump cant even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When hes gotten a tough question from a reporter. When hes challenged in a debate. When he sees a protestor at a rally. Emphasis added as it was in her delivery Imagine--if you dare imagine--imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. I cant put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis.

McAdams Narcissism disagreeableness grandiosity--a psychologist investigates how Trumps extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006 Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate near Aberdeen Scotland aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estates owner Tom Griffin sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock amp; Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But as Michael DAntonio writes in his recent biography of Trump Never Enough Griffins most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. ""It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump"" Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it.

Yes yes yes. Chelsea Clinton is not the most charismatic orator--as the Twittersphere was happy to point out during her brief address on Thursday night. She is like her mother that way. Theres something not quite natural about her self-presentation. Shes not stilted exactly. But she can come across as too cautious too reserved too conscious of other peoples eyes upon her. But lets face it as the lead-in to Hillarys big nominating speech a little bit of boring was called for. Unlike some of this conventions high-wattage speakers there was zero chance Chelsea was going to upstage Hillary with a barnburner or tear-jerker. Chelsea wasnt there to pump up the crowd. Her role was to comfort to explain to cajole with an eye toward giving Americans a glimpse of her mothers softer side.

Speaking before the throngs of celebrants who blocked the flow of traffic Taiwans deputy director of the Ministry of the Interior praised the group that funded the renovation and presented them for the 10th year straight with the national ""Excellent Religious Group"" award. ""For years you have dedicated your time and lives to anti-drug work and human- rights dissemination"" said the director echoing praise offered by the mayors office and the presidents national-policy adviser.

Khizr Khan began his speech at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday with words I wish he didnt have to say ""Tonight we are honored to stand here as parents of Captain Humayun Khan and as patriotic American Muslims--as patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country."" I wish he and his wife didnt have to stand there as the parents of a 27-year-old Army captain who was killed by suicide bombers while serving in the Iraq War. And I wish Khizr Khan hadnt felt the need to declare his patriotism and loyalty to the United States of America. Those truths should have been self-evident. The state of the union is not strong when an American feels compelled to clarify such things. In better times Khizr Khan who was born in Pakistan and moved to America from the United Arab Emirates might have begun his speech with what he said next ""Like many immigrants we came to this country empty-handed. We believed in American democracy--that with hard work and [the] goodness of this country we could share in and contribute to its blessings.""

James Fallows None Mark Salter former chief of staff to Sen. John McCain has written an essay for Real Clear Politics on why he cannot vote for Donald Trump. It deserves note for the long-term record because this is not how associates of a partys former nominee usually talk about the current one and because of its insistence on the importance of tax returns. Salter concludes (emphasis added) Could it be that a major party nominee for president is beholden to Russias leader and might compromise the security interests of the U.S. and our allies to maintain that relationship?  We dont know the answer.... We cant begin to answer the question until Trump releases his tax returns for the last several years. The media should make this the focus of every interview with Trump and senior Trump staff. The Republican Party chairman should urge him to release his returns. The Republican leadership in Congress should insist on it. Every American voter should demand it. There are legitimate suspicions about whether Trumps business relationships could compromise his loyalty to our country. Unless and until he puts them to rest not by dismissing them but by disproving them he should be considered unfit to hold the office of president.

Hillary Clinton is out of the frying pan and into the fire. On July 6 Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges against the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee for her use of a private email server at the State Department. But the following day with that criminal investigation closed the State Department reopened its own probe into the emails the AP reported. State Department spokesman John Kirby told the AP that it would be looking at potential mishandling of classified information by Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Former officials could face administrative sanctions including a loss of their security clearances--a step that would be both politically embarrassing for Clinton and complicate efforts to staff a national-security team should she prevail in November.

But there are comparisons that filmmakers bring upon themselves by means of references to other movies. Theyre not always the most enlightening comparisons (the similarities and evocations that a director intends arent always the ones that a viewer experiences) but they do sometimes prove revealing. The biggest surprise of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus new film ""Birdman"" is its opening credits the typography (as seen in the trailer) is borrowed from that of Jean-Luc Godards color films of the mid-sixties and Inarritus credits are animated--with letters filling in onscreen in alphabetical order--exactly as Godards were in ""Pierrot le Fou"" (1965). Id even say that the first shot of clouds in the sky accompanied by ethereal electronica alludes to the first shots of Godards 1980 film ""Every Man for Himself."" To borrow a line from Ernest Hemingway--as quoted by Lillian Ross in her classic 1950 Profile of him in this magazine--its not a good idea for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard. Inarritu doesnt actually do so but there is a Godardian thing about ""Birdman"" the referentiality of the casting which depends on real-world cinematic references. Michael Keaton who formerly played the role of Batman is cast here in the lead role in a quasi-art film. He is playing an actor Riggan Thomson who formerly played the movie role of Birdman and is now playing an earnest arty role in his own adaptation and stage production of a story by Raymond Carver. Inarritu does with Keaton what Godard did with Eddie Constantine in ""Alphaville"" and ""Germany Year 90 Nine Zero"" and with Anna Karina in many films he fuses the viewers knowledge of the performers previous roles (and for that matter life) with the character that the actor plays. Riggan had played the flying superhero Birdman three times and refused ""Birdman 4"" and his career went into free fall; Riggan is played by Keaton who of course played Batman twice and refused to do it a third time and whose career--if not exactly in free fall--hasnt been filled of late with plum roles. In the movie Thomson is heralded by the public as a onetime action hero and he puts on the Carver adaptation (which he writes directs produces and stars in) both to satisfy his untapped artistic drive and to reestablish himself as an actor in the movie business. ""Birdman"" seems to fulfill exactly the same function for Keaton and it seems to be working hes newly endowed with ""Oscar buzz."" The subject of the movie is an actors life and though its great to see that Keaton is back that extra-cinematic fact is unfortunately the best thing about the film. ""Birdman"" is an exercise in cinematic half-assedness it tackles big questions and offers conventional answers. It yokes technical audacity to ordinary drama and complex stagings to simple cinematic compositions. Its devotion to the art of performance exalts an utterly familiar and unchallenging style of performance. Here too Inarritu borrows tropes and tricks from previous films and boils them down to their most common least challenging elements. Inarritu films the story in what seems to be one continuous take (even though there are also transitions achieved digitally that sew together events that occur over gaps in time). The device was perhaps most famously used by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1948 film ""Rope"" (though that film does have several hard cuts between reels) and in Alexander Sokurovs 2002 fantasy ""Russian Ark."" In neither film is the technique essential to the effect. Hitchcock positions his actors and moves the camera so that what seems to result is a series of shot changes complete with close-ups and over-the-shoulder dialogue shots that could also have been achieved with editing. In Sokurovs case the action takes place in the mind of its protagonist. The unbroken image string of ""Russian Ark"" with a floating gliding and drifting camera gaze could be taken as a visualized stream of consciousness although the idea of the ninety-five-minute shot--the film as a work of conceptual art--is of greater power than its experiential impact. Theres a signal moment early in Sokurovs film in which the protagonist wonders ""Could all this be theatre?"" That of course is exactly what it is an extreme long take involves making the action come out on time like making trains run on time. Its an administrative choreography of a most delicate theatrical artifice and the weight of that artifice is a burden and a lure in the viewing of ""Birdman."" The modern cinema is borne of an ingenious critical misunderstanding Andre Bazins praise of the visual figure of long takes. They existed before Bazin was writing even in the silent cinema and sometimes in odd places (as in Harry Langdons silent comedy ""The Chaser"") but in Bazins view they were inherently praiseworthy the continuity of action and relative effacement of directorial intervention through editing seemed to him to be an increase in documentary authenticity a more honest and complete cinematic approach to reality. But soon such filmmakers as Alain Resnais Michelangelo Antonioni and Godard began using long takes not for their dramatic continuity or their directorial self-effacement but as a new form of directorial self-assertion--a passive-aggressive demand of concentration an emphasis on the existential weight of time itself. Following in their path the conspicuous long take has become a trope of the modernist cinema as in films by Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet Chantal Akerman Abbas Kiarostami Tsai Ming-liang Hong Sang-soo Lisandro Alonso Pedro Costa and others. They are distinctive directors whose differences are as important as their similarities but their work fuses both extremes of the long-take technique the theatrical artifice of staging and performance as well as the documentary aspect of continuous recording. The long take is no more inherently praiseworthy though than any other cinematic device; there are films in which the long take seems as conventional and uninspired as quick cutting can seem in weaker action films. In ""Birdman"" the long take converts cinema to theatre--and back. Its the story of a movie actor who renews both his art and his career by means of serious theatre. Inarritu stages the action onstage and off like theatre; the camera is almost always in motion and it follows the actors and their perfectly timed comings and goings and performances which as onstage demand continuity of action and characterization. In lending movie acting the technical difficulty of stage performance Inarritu reinforces the theme of ""Birdman""--the higher artistic dignity of acting in the theatre. What the cinema brings to the story is the idea of wondrous gimmickry--that of the continuous image itself along with the element of fantasy as the erstwhile Birdman seems to float in the air to enjoy telekinetic power (and he does enjoy it) to fly through the streets like Birdman appeared to do onscreen. The movie is certainly a tour de force of planning and coordination a sort of backstage theatre (behind the behind-the-scenes story of Riggans play) that would itself make for worthwhile viewing--it would even be of greater interest than the dramatic result. The cinema and the theatre exist in a dialectical tension. Put an actor onstage its theatre; record the performance with a movie camera its cinema. Film a person at the counter of a drugstore its cinema; take the camera away its not theatre; add a spectator and it is. But what delivers terrifying power in theatre may well play like comical gesticulation onscreen; the sort of infinitesimal gesture that the camera magnifies and the charismatic radiance that the camera discovers and conveys may be nothing at all onstage. Inarritu takes the average. His actors--and theyre good ones (besides Keaton the cast includes Edward Norton Emma Stone Zach Galifianakis Andrea Riseborough Amy Ryan and Naomi Watts)--offer no surprises. They do the same kind of acting onstage as off--the sort of modern naturalism without eccentricity of gesture excess of expression or heightened and formalistic precision that is the business-casual of contemporary cinema. ""Birdman"" a movie about acting celebrates an utterly familiar and unchallenging idea of acting in approach style and theatrical ethic. Its worth comparing it to another movie about actors in a troubled stage production as it speeds toward opening night--namely John Cassavetess ""Opening Night."" There an actress--played by Gena Rowlands--is deeply troubled by her role as an older woman whose age seems written into the role in a new play by a noteworthy playwright whose writing forces the actress to confront her own self-image. Despite agonies up to curtain-time the actress also faces the fact that the show must go on--but what she does onstage when she puts it on is one of the terrors and glories of the modern cinema. As in ""Birdman"" its a movie about an actors art fusing with the actors life a play about an actor who seeks redemption through a performance that she cant bear to give. But with Cassavetes and Rowlands the play is the thing and as strong as the backstage confrontations are the great actress (Rowlands in real life as well as the character she portrays in the film) surpasses herself and surpasses the play itself in an act of potentially self-sacrificing self-revealing public fury. Yes in ""Birdman"" Riggan has a crisis behind the scenes in the run-up to opening night. Yes when he gets onstage he delivers a climactic moment of life-meets-art drama. Its a grand and self-sacrificing gesture that the stage audience sees but which Inarritu doesnt show on camera and for all its tragic potential it plays both like a goof and an exaggeration. Its a desperate moment of the inadequacy of performance and of cinematography; its as if Inarritu were admitting through the character of Riggan his own inability to invent a mode of performance all his own. What Inarritu comes up with instead is a rejection of acting as such a nihilistic blow that he himself failed to depict--because he held it up to his sleeve cagily for dramatic effect. If ""Birdman"" is intended to prove what the actors--and especially Keaton--can do its a success but what has he done? He has done what the movie has Riggan Thomson do he has reestablished himself has shown off his acting chops in a production that calls for his professionalism not his imagination. What he hasnt done here--as he doubtless can do (and its up to a director to inspire him to do it)--is to get outside the story and become a subject in himself one that is opaque adamantine mysterious explosive and irreducible. Thats the essence of movie acting not performance not interpretation but (to borrow the fine idea behind James Harveys recent book) being. Instead ""Birdman"" trades on facile casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce. Its a white elephant of a movie that conceals a mouse of timid wisdom a mighty and churning machine of virtuosity that delivers a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama. Of such things too can Oscar buzz be made. Richard Brody began writing for The New Yorker in 1999 and has contributed articles about the directors Francois Truffaut Jean-Luc Godard and Samuel Fuller.

(Photo Alison Rosa Fox Searchlight )So exhilarating it can be exhausting ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is a film that challenges surprises and dazzles while still working at the edges of a frazzled mind.That mind would belong to Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) a movie star who long ago played a superhero character named Birdman to international acclaim before walking away from the franchise. Now hes written an adaptation of a Raymond Carver story that hes staging on Broadway directing himself as the star trying to reignite his career and validate his work.The idea of casting Keaton in the role is as brilliant as it is obvious Keaton having been the original Batman before he walked away from the franchise. Keaton was never as desperate as Riggan -- he just sort of wandered away from the Hollywood hustle for years -- but theres no denying this is a prime comeback opportunity and he takes full advantage of it delivering a rich performance thats both comic and poignant.Still a meta-casting trick and fine star turn do not necessarily guarantee a good movie. Luckily ""Birdman"" has all its parts going at full speed.A superb supporting cast clicks perfectly and thats lucky because director and co-writer Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Babel"" ""21 Grams"") and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (he won an Oscar for ""Gravity"") have made the film a series of long mesmerizing choreographed tracking shots in which the actors come and go. One missed beat and the shot crumbles and the high anxiety of that pressure seems to have brought out the best in all involved.The result is a cinematic experience that never seems to stop flowing with the viewer giddily caught up in the current. Scenes stretch on and seem to effortlessly blend into one another. Life never stops in this movie.And such a life it is. We first find Riggan in his underwear meditating floating above his dressing room floor setting the stage for the films magical realism dilemma Is Riggan so delusional he thinks he actually has the powers of Birdman (whose voice regularly chastises him) or are these powers actually real?Theres little time to ponder that because Riggan has so many practical concerns. For one his male co-star isnt working out so one of the female stars Lesley (Naomi Watts) suggests her temperamental but brilliant boyfriend Mike (Edward Norton a likely Oscar nominee) a name star wholl sell tickets but whose antagonizing personality threatens to destroy the production.And then theres the plays other actress Laura (Andrea Riseborough) who happens to be Riggans lover and also happens to think shes pregnant. And of course Riggans grounded ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan) drops by for a visit.But Sylvia isnt really there to see Riggan shes there to see their daughter Sam (Emma Stone another likely Oscar nominee) just out of rehab and working as Riggans complaining assistant. And constantly fretting over everything financial and personal is Riggans best friend and manager Jake (Zach Galifianakis).All these characters come together in a lets-put-on-a-play story laced with assorted insecurities self-loathing and delusions. ""Birdman"" pointedly tackles issues of self-worth of legacy of artistic intent and identity with stunning visual flair and imagination while never forgetting to be enjoyable.Can Riggan really fly? Can any of us? ""Birdman"" doesnt offer the answer but revels in the question.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Oct. 24 2014 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Oct. 24 2014 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Alejandro G. Inarritu Written by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris Armando Bo Starring Michael Keaton Edward Norton Emma Stone and Zach Galifianakis Classification 14A Country USA Language English My but the new Alejandro G. Inarritu movie Birdman has some fascinating things going on. Foremost theres a wonderful visual stunt in the tradition of Alfred Hitchcocks 1948 film Rope in which the film unfolds as a long sinewy dance that starts in to jazz drumming (Antonio Sanchez) moves on through Mahler cello moans and back to jazz. The great cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity Children of Men) weaves his roving lens through the corridors of St. James Theater on West 44th Street through the claustrophobic corridors in and out of dressing rooms onstage and from the rafters up noses and under covers and on to rooftops. The technique casts a spell as the actors entrances and exits are choreographed around the cameras movement. Among the living beings who are strung along the cameras moving thread the foremost is Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton in a self-reflexive role) a 60-ish former Hollywood actor still known for his trilogy of Birdman action movies decades before. Now Riggan has staked his money and aspirations of artistic respectability on a vanity project Broadway play and of course this being the theatre everything possible goes farcically wrong.The troubles start with the improbable material. The play that Riggan has adapted is a dramatization of Raymond Carvers chillingly bleak title story to his 1981 collection What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. The story which appears to be an update on Platos Symposium features two couples getting sloshed on gin swapping stories about suicide wife abuse and a horrific car accident. Much of Carvers story makes it into the film along with some additional scenes that return to the theme of death as lifes final scorekeeper a theme that Inarritu (21 Grams Amores Perros Babel) has plumbed with dreamy morbid ardour.The cast of this four-hand play includes Riggan (in the starring role of course) as Mel an alcoholic abyss-treading cardiologist. Theres Lesley (Naomi Watts) another insecure movie star making her Broadway debut as his stage wife. Then theres Laura (Andrea Riseborough) who is Riggans younger unappreciated lover. As a last-minute stand-in is Mike (Edward Norton) Lesleys strutting cock of a movie-star boyfriend who arrives knowing everyones lines and with some rewrites in mind. He proceeds to try to take over the entire production.In the backstage realm we have Sam (Emma Stone) Riggans fresh-from-rehab daughter who is working as his antagonistic personal assistant. Theres Jake (Zach Galifianakis) a fretful lawyer and yes-man producer and Mikes noble disappointed wife (Amy Ryan) who pops in a couple of times to wish him well.Theres one more important figure the title character Birdman Riggans superhero character from decades ago who lives on as a growling negative voice inside the cracked actors head. Nothings necessarily entirely literal here but Birdman is not just the garden variety voice of inner self-loathing and closer to depressive psychosis. Among Riggans fantasies is that he can levitate When we first see him hes sitting in his underwear in mid-air in his apartment-dressing room. Riggan can move and destroy objects with his mind rather than just smash them in a bad temper. His madness is distinctly thespian-centric He believes he can will himself to be someone much greater than he is.Since Birdman had its premiere in Venice in September theres been tremendous buzz about the film. Theres the shooting style of course but especially compelling is Keatons antsy funny physical performance thats as much about Riggans physical deterioration as a mental breakdown. As his opposite the seemingly virile usurper Nortons Mike struts and frets and shows off. And shows how an actor can take a speech and kill it then smirk at his own gift.At the same time theres something about Birdman that makes it while memorable less than brilliant. Theres something inherently mechanical about the Noises Off style the farcical pairing off the jealous triangles the gratuitous lesbian smooch a quickie on the catwalk. Its the sort of familiarity that would be easier to enjoy if the writing had the panache of the visual style and the big performances. When you think about some of the memorable contemporary plays about performance (John Osbornes The Entertainer Ronald Harwoods The Dresser) the language pops with poetic intensity and epigrammatic snap that adds to the intoxication. There are four writers credited (Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris Armando Bo and Inarritu) and often the script feels as if they traded off scenes and punched up dialogue without creating an organic package. Theres lots of vaguely clever name-dropping (from Justin Bieber to Roland Barthes) but also speeches that creak like an unoiled pulley from up in the rafters.Earlier on theres a scene where Sam (Stone) expresses her rage with her father (he was away a lot) with a diatribe about how irrelevant he is in the age of Twitter and Facebook. Never mind that this supposed dichotomy between the turmoil of artistic creation and cheap instant fame (which Riggan eventually achieves with a highly public pants-down flourish) felt tired long before the first tweet was uttered. While Stones visage in close-up is a mesmerizing thing (like an anime character her face is half eyeballs) the monologue has all the fake profundity of an Aaron Sorkin-penned rant.Among the clumsiest of scenes is one in which Riggan having slipped back to drinking runs into a fearsome theatre critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan) who for some peculiar reason handwrites her reviews while drinking at a bar next to the theatre. The imperious Tabitha declares to Riggan that shes going ""to kill his play"" on principle because hes a toxic interloper in the world of serious theatre. That allows him to respond with a blistering takedown on the cowardice and creative deadness of critics. Maybe its also a hallucination. Broadway as an inviolate temple of art? Since when - never.Yes at its best Birdman soars swoops and flutters with life and invention but it parrots more than it speaks. You long for a writer as reliably elegantly witty as Tom Stoppard whose dramas are typically ""backstage"" or if not Stoppard at least a verbal speed-puncher like Armando Iannucci (HBO series Veep) or if not Iannucci someone as relentlessly inventive and obsessive as Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation) to make you feel like somebody is trying to say something rather than a writing team filling in the intelligent-sounding words to support the boisterous performances and the virtuosic camera dance.

Inarritus soaring and dark comedy ""Birdman"" are surely not to everybodys liking. Beginning with protagonist Riggan Thomson they are odd ducks to put it gently. But then thats why this flock is in need of Inarritus generous touch. The director has guided the flawed and the prickly with compassion throughout his career starting with ""Amores Perros"" then on to ""21 Grams"" ""Babel"" and ""Biutiful."" Michael Keaton nakedly embodies the former super-hero franchise star angling for an artistic triumph on Broadway. Ambition need regret resentment arrogance and dire doubt will be on rare and constant display as Thomson tries to mount direct and star in an adaptation -- his own -- of Raymond Carvers short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" In one of his finest turns Edward Norton chews up the scenery with apt relish as Mike Shiner. The critically lauded thespian comes on board after a freak accident brains one of the plays stars (former Coloradan and Tony winner Jeremy Shamos). Naomi Watts is Lesley the lead actress so close to her Broadway debut that when it looks in danger of imploding she offers up the erratic Mike (her boyfriend) as a replacement. Andrea Riseborough plays Riggans younger lover and cast member. Zach Galifianakis does hysterical (in the psychological as well as comedic sense of the word) work as Riggans best friend and producer. ""The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" is the movies subtitle. But ignorance is anything but bliss here. Its torment. The only grounding presence here is Riggans ex-wife played with a kind of no-B.S. clarity and charity by Amy Ryan. The biggest naysayer to Riggans misbegotten endeavor is his alter ego his former superhero self whose very appearance calls into question Riggans grip on reality. Hes a guy in a big black bird suit with a deep cadence that pecks and pecks at the carrion of Riggans rotting sense of accomplishment. (Drummer Antonio Sanchezs percussive score cues us even more to Riggans precarious state of mind.) Yes the movie makes sport of the superhero genre. And many in the cast feel like refugees from superhero franchises. Norton was Banner in the second rebooted ""Hulk."" Emma Stone (""Spider-Man"" reboot two) plays Sam Riggans daughter and resentful assistant fresh out of rehab. Even so Keaton who played the first incarnation of the retooled cape crusader in Tim Burtons ""Batman"" portrays Riggan without a nano-drop of irony. Meant to resemble one continuous shot the film is a triumph of cinematic discipline and rhythm as it moves from dressing rooms to hallways to the stage and back. Theres a reason or two why Mike hops out of a tanning bed (dont ask) with a copy of Jorge Luis Borges ""Labyrinths"" in hand. Not every gesture here is pitch perfect. Very fine British actress Lindsay Duncan portrays Tabitha the cool and contemptuous New York Times theater critic. She hates that movie stars are aiming for theaters special grace and promises Riggan over a martini at a Broadway watering hole shell destroy him and his play. Her power may be apt to some degree. Just this year Alec Baldwin went ape over a critical review by the Times chief theater scribe Ben Brantley. Ditto James Franco. But Tabithas derision rings false. (Not to mention a more vexing problem with the character When was the last time a major theater critic was a woman?) Still theres more right than wrong more humane than fabricated more brilliant than bird-brained. Even when Inarritus ambitious dramas have been narratively uneven they have always been touched by grace and full of melancholy shattering ecstatic moments. ""Birdman"" -- written with Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo -- is his most astonishing work yet. Does it dip? A time or two. Does it take vivid flight? Absolutely.

"Cape Fear The Entertaining Critique of the Superhero Industry in Birdman << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Cape Fear The Entertaining Critique of the Superhero Industry in Birdman Fox Searchlight Movies October 21 2014 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus Birdman is so good so profoundly entertaining so confident that it makes you wonder whether the other Inarritu -- the director of such weighty magazine spreads as 21 Grams Babel and Biutiful -- was a fraud all along. I mean the fraudulence was on parade. The new movie is a parable of breaking out of the prison of artistic fraudulence and into some kind of personal truth. The explicit appearance of that word truth in art makes you nervous especially when writers or directors are sure theyve found it. But Birdman brings Inarritus gifts into alignment with his subject. Ive never left one of his movies persuaded by any social or political argument (in brief globalism crushes the human spirit). Inarritu plays with time space and proportion to assert that the universe is rigged against us whether one happens to be some well-off white American lady her Mexican housekeeper or an increasingly sick increasingly impoverished Javier Bardem. What stands out in his work though is not spiritual death. Its the dazzle of the chalk outline and how many cinematic and narrative devices were required to paint it. More Awards SeasonAll of our Oscar coverageInarritus talent has never been in doubt. Its vertiginous. But until now it hasnt aligned with his moral vision his sense that the world can be a miserable place and that movies have a responsibility to engage with suffering. His big loud deeply seductive style was all wrong for moralized depictions of death tragedy and the underclass. He was putting 400 jeans on a corpse. His movies were never as deep as he was desperate to make them out to be. Whenever he could pump up the volume hed blow out your eardrums with grotesque meaning. He didnt want to break your heart. He wanted to blast it to smithereens. He has instincts for throbbing glamour. The best moments in his movies are kinetic suspenseful surrealist or absurdist the souls of dead Chinese sweatshop workers stuck to a factory ceiling in Biutiful say or anytime Inarritu visits a disco. Working with the masterful cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto for much of his career Inarritu has made movies about the hungry that make you want to eat movies about the poor that make you want to buy movies about sensory deprivation that make you want to dance. You can easily imagine the parody the director saying ""OK show me death Great. Now give me a little deprivation I love it Perfect"" Inarritus style came off as self-importance suggesting a kind of artistic insecurity that hasnt afflicted his good friends and Mexican compatriots Alfonso Cuaron and Guillermo del Toro. It may not be that Inarritu was too proud to make Gravity or Pacific Rim; it may be that he didnt know how. But you really do leave something as brutalizing and emotionally preposterous as Babel thinking the person who directed it should have made a superhero comedy instead. Birdman is as close as Inarritu can bring himself to that -- and he achieves it by inveighing against the superheroing of American mass entertainment. It lowers and turns the globalist stakes of a typical Inarritu film inward. The subject is the self the world is a stage and the presentation -- one long illusory take guided by the rhythm of an all-drum jazz score -- is a dream. Shedding that highly wrought moralizing vision in favor of lightness better suits his style. Birdman is set in and around Broadways St. James Theater home to a production of a play based on Raymond Carvers story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" Hearing one character say the play is a terrible idea is nice but probably unnecessary. From the minute the camera follows Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) from his dressing room to a rehearsal where you hear the earnestness the other actors have poured on the dialogue youre prepared for some kind of satire. The camera paces around Riggan and three other actors -- Lesley (Naomi Watts) Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and Ralph (Jeremy Shamos) -- until a light falls onto Ralphs head and the movie becomes a farce. Before the lamp strikes Ralph the camera settles on Riggan staring up into the rafters. We think hes bored but he has willed the accident (Ralph sucks). The telekinesis is some secret side effect of Riggans years playing a superhero -- the eponymous Birdman -- in a couple of blockbusters. Those years are behind him as are the height of his fame. Hes starring in adapting and directing this play as a way to reestablish himself as someone other than the guy who played the superhero the superhero whose voice -- a commanding horrifically hilariously erotically deep baritone almost a parody of manliness -- continues to taunt him. That Keaton has agreed to subject himself to this particular X-ray of fame and its discontents heightens the extent to which Birdman is also a meta movie about Keatons fame a consideration of the idea that being Batman warped not only his career but his sanity. It works because Inarritu finds the right mix of heft and levity ridiculousness and solemnity so the movie never becomes the joke its trying to tell. Down an actor without much time before opening night Riggan starts hunting for a replacement with his exasperated manager and producer Jake (Zach Galifianakis). ""What about Jeremy Renner?"" says Jake. ""Jeremy who?"" says Riggan. The other names they volley are locked up in Hollywood franchises. ""Hes doing The Hunger Games ... Hes doing the X-Men ... Hes an Avenger."" Lesley suggests Mike a respected pricey stage actor played by Edward Norton (who of course made a notorious outing as the Incredible Hulk and was replaced as though he never existed). Mike comes aboard and infects the production with his libido egotism and pretentiousness. He hits on Riggans daughter and personal assistant Sam (Emma Stone). He insists that every onstage moment be ""real."" During previews he drinks actual gin and wants to have real sex with an appalled Lesley. The character is as much a spoof of Method acting and ego trips as most acting spoofs are. Norton happens to be a smart actor -- one who could be mocking his own integrity. When he stands onstage lecturing Riggan about Geraldine Page and Helen Hayes and Jason Robards he makes it a laugh line but when he sits down at the plays kitchen table and actually acts out a scene Riggan is blown away. The brilliance of Norton here -- of Norton in most of his best work -- is a kind of casual virtuosity. It can veer into arrogance (hes too good for most of the stuff hes done). But Birdman encourages him to veer. Mike is so good and so hard to direct that Riggan suspects that hes going to steal the show. You suspect that Nortons going to do the same to Keaton and this movie.  Every once in a while Ill wonder what happened to certain actors. What sent them south what turned us off who came along and was better at doing what they did? Keatons demise provoked those kinds of questions. He was manically funny intense cracklingly smart and a weird kind of sexy. He made for an idiosyncratic Batman. His rhythms were offbeat (he was working with peak Tim Burton which helped). He seemed to play the part as two different men. That may be what the other guys in masks and capes were also going for but Keaton was the one I believed. In such movies as My Life from 1993 or The Paper from the following year though Keaton was righteous and self-pitying. He was likable yet needed too much to be liked. It was only when he played crazy -- in Beetlejuice and Pacific Heights and Desperate Measures -- that he seemed free of neediness. By the late 1990s hed come to seem secondary showing up in supporting roles often as cops. But in Quentin Tarantinos Jackie Brown or The Other Guys or his self-parodic Ken doll in Toy Story 3 youd get a flash of his old vitality and miss him. Birdman whose script is credited to Inarritu and three other writers is about the idea of a Michael Keaton an actor ossified -- in the minds of some -- as this one character. Its a project different from what Tarantino did for Pam Grier in Jackie Brown or what Mabrouk El Mechri did for Jean-Claude Van Damme in JCVD. Its closer to what Steven Soderbergh had in mind for Terence Stamp in The Limey something neither robustly nostalgic nor backhandedly worshipful. Birdman contains a few microscopic jokes about say Keatons receding hairline but the movie presents Keaton as a great talent who fell between the cracks of the very ground he broke who was the first version of a George Clooney or a Robert Downey Jr. He was a kind of pioneer of Hollywood movie monoculture (youre no one without a franchise now) and a casualty of it (should he have stopped playing Batman?). Youre worried that Birdman wont let Keaton become more than a martyr that he wont be able to stay in on the joke that the comedy will get away from him that Norton really is going to steal this movie. But Riggan gives Keaton enough to play. Hes shallow selfish self-loathing bitter and needy. Hes what Im sure Inarritu thinks is a kind of Fellini hero -- a voluptuous mess of a man in a backstage circus being orbited by exasperated and adoring women. Riggans daughter Sam is a recovering addict who gives him angry lectures and affectionate speeches. Theres the imperiously snooty New York Times theater critic (Lindsay Duncan) who promises to write a review that closes the show. When Riggans ex-wife (Amy Ryan) stops by his dressing room before a preview looking ethereal the movie feels even more like a dream than it already is. But Riggans comic narcissism punctures her moony fondness. What did she ever see in him? And what about Riseboroughs Laura who might be pregnant with Riggans baby? Not that far into things amid the personnel chaos Riseborough backs away from Keaton up a set of stairs and out a door with a look of romantic hunger thats one of the happiest sights in Birdman. As proof of Keatons gravitational pull whenever one of these women usually Stone is alone with Norton the movie ceases to glide. You sometimes wish the movie could rest a little longer on Watts. She and Riseborough have one of the best exchanges in the movie. Theyre sitting in Lesleys dressing room and Watts is covered in fake blood asking ""Why dont I ever have any self-respect?"" Riseboroughs perfectly timed response got a big laugh both times I saw the movie. You wish the camera would spend more time at Wattss back or gazing into her rueful face. Riseborough and especially Stone are given just enough to work with. But Watts is the kind of actress for whom just enough wont cut it. While the camera is following Keaton and Norton you fear that a wonderful performance is going to waste in another corridor or room. In a manner not dissimilar from the way Darren Aronofsky made Black Swan a critique of artistic perfection Inarritu is taking Fellinis full-figured personal comedies and slimming them down to ask modern questions about the nature of culture. Are Mike and that woman from the Times right? Does a beached movie star have any business putting on such an embarrassing-looking play? Why make an 18 million movie when you can go viral for free? Is social media really what gives a person clout? These are not deep questions. They might not even be very interesting questions. And this is not the film to look to for answers -- well for clear answers. ""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige"" says Mike. Its a line thats funnier as poetry than it is sensical as truth. Later Sam says to Riggan ""Believe it or not this is power"" holding up her cell phone thats playing a viral video of her father from earlier in the evening. Its as if shes showing a caveman electricity. Ultimately the only thing this movie is about is Inarritus virtuosity. Birdman is so self-consciously self-reflexively controlled that youre shocked that the roving camerawork doesnt happen upon the source of the soundtracks jazzy kick drum spasms and snare spanks -- and then suddenly sure enough theres a shot of Nate Smith playing Antonio Sanchezs score on a kit in the theater. The pacing of these scenes is perfect following the rhythms of the music. For the first half of the movie the antic motion rarely stops and the maneuvering around corners and up stairs and between actors (there are noticeable tiny parts for Merritt Wever and Benjamin Kanes) gives you a kind of high like youre at an amusement park. After Amores Perros Inarritus first and still his most pungent most raw film the director was presiding over dreary carnivals. But for once the high doesnt make you nauseated. The scenes in Birdman have a new quality breakneck serenity. Some of this -- perhaps a lot of it -- is due to the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki. The camera roves and floats into rooms and down hallways. At some point it rests at an intersection inside the theater staring down a corridor waiting (hoping?) for someone to pass into view. When activity is spied the camera drifts in that direction. It looks skyward as night turns to day and it lowers itself like an elevator from the rafters to the stage from the roof of the St. James to 44th Street below. Lubezki Inarritu and the actors make it all look easy. They manage to do it without it overwhelming you the way too many ""great"" tracking shots do. The darkened trips through doorways are cues to breathe. Borrowing the great Lubezki from Cuaron for whom Lubezki shot Children of Men and Gravity is a signal that Inarritu is changing gears that he wants to compete with his friends to make their kinds of movies fun ones. To that end Birdman builds toward a distinctly surrealist climax in which Riggans alter ego starts to cannibalize his reality. His insecurities feel like Inarritus regarding what kind of director he is versus the kind of director he thinks he ought to be. (He has even changed his name for this movie Its Alejandro G. Inarritu) His sense of morality is saying hes Satyajit Ray. His energy and immense talent for stunt craft are saying hes an even better Michael Bay. That struggle at the finale the struggle between the fraud you perpetrate and the particular kind of artist you truly are gives the movie a lot of its power. Birdman comes with a subtitle -- The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance -- that feels as much about Inarritus delusions as about Riggans. (It also gives the movie its admittedly absurd metaphysical punch line.) Before a tussle with Riggan Mike rises from the tanning bed hes had installed at the theater holding a copy of Jorge Luis Borgess Labyrinths. The Borges allusion is not accidental. It feels more right than the reaching for Fellini and Carver. Borges was a magician fond of repetition and warping time of dreams nesting within dreams of fakery as an expedient path to truth. He liked the ironic outcomes of grim struggles the comedy of accepting what has always been. An undertow of determinism is always apparent in Inarritus work. This is the first of his films since Amores Perros to reconsider the ecstasies (however limited) of some sort of free will. As a satire Birdman isnt as mordant as Robert Altman John Waters or David Cronenbergs mockeries of the film industry. Those are outsider directors who never wanted in. Inarritu has made a big showy Hollywood entertainment thats as much about himself and his ego as about anything else. Now at 51 hes comfortable with the admission that he has always been the superhero of these movies. This article has been updated to reflect that Nate Smith not Brian Blade appears as a drummer in Birdman.

Enter Birdman an inventive surreal backstage drama that wears its virtuosity on its sleeve piles on meta-references and gradually gets a little chilly to the touch.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus barbwire showbiz fable revolves around an actor who cashed in playing a superhero played by Michael Keaton an actor who cashed in playing Batman. Keatons Riggan Thomson once a bankable star is now paunchy self-loathing and apparently losing his marbles. Or maybe he really can make objects move by pointing at them and converse with his former feathered alter ego.In any case hes out to prove his artistic bona fides by mounting an ambitious Broadway adaptation of the Raymond Carver short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" The camera follows Riggan his caustic daughter (Emma Stone) his narcissistic leading man (Edward Norton having a blast) and other theatrical spirits through a labyrinthine backstage area in what looks like one continuous shot as jazz drummer Antonio Sanchez pounds out the score.The camera work led by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (an Oscar winner for Gravity) is a character in itself. Back and forth and round and round Riggan goes through long corridors and in one memorable scene through Times Square in his tighty whities. Hes chasing an idea of what he thinks he should be what he could have been and the camera refuses to let him escape.Keaton has become an infrequent guest at the multiplex and here he reminds us what a shame that is. Hes quick as always shifting from egomania to despondence and back again with alarming instinct. Hes charming and hes a little dangerous. Hes key to the sense that anything can happen in Birdman.Unfortunately it all happens in a long-winded script that too often mistakes excess verbiage for trenchant observation of the artistic imagination. As Birdman does its laps around the theater occasionally stopping for inspired moments of visual free association it also goes in thematic circles.One tin-eared scene finds Riggan confronting a blowsy New York Times theater critic (Lindsay Duncan) who explains shes already decided to destroy the play because of what Riggan represents (washed-up Hollywood player desperate for belated creative approval). Shaky in conception the sequence is even more awkward in execution. Birdman has a habit of wandering about stopping long enough to bend our ears and then continuing through its maze.I want to like Birdman more but I dont have to; its already so pleased with itself. Watching the film is a little like hanging out with the smartest kid in class who knows exactly how smart he is. (Its subtitle is The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance.)I admired its willingness to experiment especially with the perpetually moving camera (this couldnt have been an easy movie to shoot).Keatons re-emergence is a welcome development. Hell be back soon in the newspaper thriller Spotlight. I just wish I had as much fun watching Birdman as they seem to have had making it.BIRDMAN (B)Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.

"Birdmans tale of clipped wings flies high review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBirdmans tale of clipped wings flies high review Michael Keatons superlative performance in Birdman makes you want to latch onto the films scruffy neck and fly wherever it goes. Michael Keaton left and Edward Norton star in Birdman. Keaton plays a fading star famous for a superhero role 20 years in his past.  (Alison Rosa / AP)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Oct. 23 2014Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)Starring Michael Keaton Edward Norton Emma Stone Naomi Watts Zach Galifianakis and Andrea Riseborough. Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. Opens Friday Oct. 24 at the Varsity. 119 minutes. 14AAndy Warhol was wrong. Fame isnt something that lasts a mere 15 minutes no matter whether youre talking about the past or the future. Once it touches a person it clings like blood stains on Lady Macbeths hands. Or at least the memory of it does a corrosive affliction far worse for the ego and noggin than never having tasted fame in the first place. Article Continued BelowWitness the bitter truth of Michael Keatons meta-riff as the clipped-wing title character of Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) the double espresso of a new film by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel).Keaton played Batman twice in Tim Burtons two caped crusader blockbusters before forsaking comic books (and fat paycheques) for a more serious but less buzzed-about career. Hes in much the same position as Birdmans Riggan Thomson 20 years past an avian superhero whom he soared three times to dizzying popcorn heights before shelving his Spandex beak and feathers. He turned down Birdman 4 much to the dismay of his fans and accountants because he harboured serious thespian ambitions (insert hollow laugh here).Riggan has second-guessed that decision ever since. This predicament manifests itself not just in the real worry lines on Keatons weathered face but also in the magic realism of a Beetlejuice-voiced Birdman presence that haunts and taunts him ""You were a movie star remember?""Hes vainly seeking artistic redemption by directing and starring in a Broadway production based on Raymond Carvers short story collection What We Talk About When We Talk About Love the in-joke (of many) being that Carver wrote about characters in various stages of the four Ds drink denial deceit and desperation. Riggan adds a personal touch Carver once sent him kudos in a message scribbled on a cocktail napkin.Riggan has learned to accept the profane Birdman jeers in his head. What he cant quite handle are all the other boo birds hovering about him his nagging junkie daughter (Emma Stone); his stressing friend/manager (Zach Galifianakis); his judging ex-wife (Amy Ryan); his hassling erstwhile girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough); and his needy lead actress (Naomi Watts).Worst of all is Mike Shiner the actor whom Riggan hired to play opposite him and to buff his tarnished star but who instead comes on like a sandpaper facial. Played with maniacal zest by Edward Norton who nurses his own superhero scars (The Incredible Hulk debacle) Mike is one of those actors who likes to challenge his co-stars at every turn even if it kills them.Inarritu and his nimble cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki present all this like a radioactive can of worms the camera observing but not resting as it rips through what seems like one single take in the entire film (there are a few subtle edits).Birdman is never less than entertaining and often archly amusing and Keaton is the right guy for this gig in every sense Oscar aspirations included. Hes smart enough and experienced enough to satirize the artifice of show biz even while still licking his wounds from fames sharp barbs.I couldnt help but feel though that Inarritu and his three co-screenwriters are a little too clever for their own good like that nonsensical and grammar-defying full title for the film. They act as if finding fools gold behind the glitter of Hollywood/Broadway is some kind of revelation as if Birdmans many predecessors -- including Sunset Boulevard and TheSweet Smell of Success -- never happened.And while the single-take conceit succeeds here its hardly an innovation having being tried at one time or another by everyone from Alfred Hitchcock to Robert Altman the latters Short Cuts having dipped into the same Carver omnibus as Birdman.Birdman also has the curiosity of a character we immediately recognize while at the same time rejecting Lindsay Duncans rancid New York Times theatre critic Tabitha Dickinson is the distaff version of George Sanders poisoned-penned Addison DeWitt from All About Eve. Tabitha beggars belief in her lack of humour and her assertion to Riggan that shes going to trash his play sight unseen; DeWitt would have been this dull or unsporting. But Inarritu and his crew are also capable of brainwaves such as their soundtrack choice of a jazz drummer who is so manic he sometimes seems to forget hes supposed to be off camera. Pythonesque touches such as these along with Keatons superlative performance make you want to latch onto Birdmans scruffy neck and fly wherever it goes even if its too close to the sun.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsA lesson learned from the lure of a high-yield return MayersYou can improve investment returns by shopping around but if an investment offers a rate that seems to be good to be true it probably is.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Comments (11) click to enlarge Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) Recommended Rated R  119 minutes  2014 A washed-up Hollywood star (Michael Keaton) famous for playing a winged superhero in a multimillion-dollar action franchise tries to stage a comeback as a serious actor on Broadway writing directing and starring in a stage adaptation of Raymond Carvers story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" Given Keatons identification with the title character in Batman (1989) his role here might seem like the ultimate stunt casting. Yet before playing the Caped Crusader hed already distinguished himself in both comedy (Beetlejuice) and drama (Clean and Sober) and he more than holds his own in a cast that includes Edward Norton Naomi Watts Emma Stone Andrea Riseborough and Zach Galifianakis. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu director of such ethereal dramas as Babel and 21 Grams counterbalances the wicked backstage comedy with surreal flights of fancy pondering the gulf between dubious celebrity and artistic immortality.

Couldnt have been more wrong. Aside from its annoyingly punctuated full title ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" inspires renewed faith in what we used to go to the movies for -- original storytelling enveloping escape heart-stopping camera work and enough ""wait whats going on here?"" to keep us intrigued from beginning to end. Shot in just 30 days at the St. James Theatre off Times Square in New York ""Birdman"" is by turns intimate surreal and darkly funny also boasting the remarkable visual effect of appearing to have been shot in one continuous take. Plus youll get your lifetime-guaranteed fill of eyeballing Michael Keaton in tighty whities (and Edward Norton in a splashier option). Keaton plays Riggan Thompson who recently turned down the chance to play costumed movie superhero Birdman a third time in favor of a riskier less lucrative but more prestigious project directing and starring in a stage version of a Raymond Carver short story. When a co-star gets injured just before previews another boldface name whose talent is exceeded only by his conceit Mike Shiner (a perfectly cast Edward Norton) cruises in as a last-minute replacement. As Mike begins to upset applecarts with his Method acting and unsolicited suggestions Riggan also wrestles with his just-out-of-rehab assistant/daughter Sam (the delightful Emma Stone). Alison Rosa  Fox Searchlight Pictures Michael Keaton left and Edward Norton mix it up in ""Birdman."" Best pal/producer Jake (a newly svelte underused Zach Galifianakis) repeatedly talks panicked depressed Riggan off the ledge. A haughty crabapple of a New York Times critic (Lindsay Duncan) threatens to burn him down before the show has even opened. Naomi Watts and Andrea Riseborough as the plays insecure women stars and Amy Ryan as Riggans compassionate ex all add interesting side drama. Keaton (who played another superhero Batman twice) is a polarizer; people seem to love or hate him. Whatever your view its tough to dispute the new layered depths he brings to Riggan who goes on periodic flights of fancy high above the streets of New York inhabited by his alter ego/cynical conscience Birdman. Writer/director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Babel"" ""21 Grams"" ""Biutiful"") gracefully weaves these magical-realism interludes between the more grounded activity in the dressing rooms and musty halls of the St. James. Another trademark of Inarritu who was once a DJ in Mexico City is his exceptional ear for music that enriches a films sensory impact without distracting from the action. In this case its an almost entirely percussive score composed by Grammy-winning jazz drummer Antonio Sanchez. Daring imaginative and a technical tour de force ""Birdman"" is the cinematic antidote to actual superhero flicks and overblown Broadway shows.

Now hes starring in much artier fare Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus darkly comic backstage drama Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance). Keaton plays Riggan a guy who used to be a box-office superstar in part because he played Birdman in three films. (Art improves on life?) Now Riggan is starring in much artier fare a stage dramatization of Raymond Carvers short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" Birdman  Its a passion project a late-career bid to be taken seriously again or at least to be noticed. For Keaton or for Riggan? Well thats your call though Keaton certainly comes off better as an actor. Riggan is a man on the edge everything absolutely everything is going wrong in his life. Plus hes routinely haunted by his feathery famous alter-ego rumbling about past glories and present humiliations urging him to become the superhero he once was and maybe could be again. Its tough to portray a man like that without slipping into manic mannerism; Keaton is up to the job. The action covers the preview performances running up to the shows premiere and its devotion to showbiz types and cliches is positively wondrous. For a while I tried to write them all down but it got distracting. Besides they didnt bother me much mostly because Innaritu (who also co-wrote) seems so sweetly fond of them. Hes having fun as he winds his camera through the labyrinthine bowels of the theater like a starstruck fly and he wants you to have fun too. Just try not to grin when star actress Naomi Watts talks about still being the little girl who always wanted to be an actress or when troubled daughter Emma Stone lays into Riggan about the folly of his artistic self-importance or when genius actor Ed Norton says that the only time he can be himself is when hes onstage. Or or or... Besides the cliched action isnt the point. The point is the artist and the self he is forever attempting to express the war he is waging on his own brief insignificance his mighty struggle to slip free of historys obliterating grip and soar toward heaven and immortality. Its a hoot. (Mostly anyway. There are some draggy bits that even the thump-a-drum score cannot enliven.)

Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) used to be famous -- very famous. As the superhero Birdman he starred in films that generated big bucks and made him a force in Hollywood. But those days are long gone.Thats fine with Riggan whos looking for the kind of validation that popcorn flicks cant provide but that Broadway can. Hes about to star in a play he adapted from the work of acclaimed short-story writer Raymond Carver -- a play that could be his ticket back to the big time.But Riggan has his skeptics including resentful daughter Sam (Emma Stone) who serves as his assistant and problematic co-star Mike (Ed Norton) who has his own ideas about the production. It doesnt help that Riggan is haunted by an imaginary presence Birdman who keeps reminding him that hed still be a movie star if he hadnt let integrity get in the way.Riggan values his integrity. But part of him fears that Birdman is right -- that he had it all and he blew it. And what if the play flops? Wont that make him an even bigger loser? ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is a marvel -- a film that pulls you in with its fearless artistry. In an age of sequels and remakes director and co-writer Alejandro G. Inarritu (""Babel"") goes for originality and without compromise. And he elicits from Keaton who played Batman in two films directed by Tim Burton a performance thats astonishing in its emotional nakedness. Riggan is perched between redemption and oblivion and Keaton brilliantly captures his angst. This could be his comeback film.But its not just Keatons show. Norton is a blast as a guy with an ego made for showbiz. And in one of her best performances Stone is terrific -- particularly in a scene in which she scathingly brings Riggan down to earth.Lots of films claim to be different.

(Fox Searchlight) By Ann Hornaday October 23 2014 Follow AnnHornaday In ""Birdman or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" Michael Keaton plays an actor named Riggan Thomson who first appears hovering several inches above his dressing room floor deep in meditation. Hes trying to ignore the voice of the title character his alter ego who takes the form of the comic book character he once played and whose superpowers he now seems able to conjure at the drop of a black leather cowl. ""How did we end up here?"" Birdman growls in a sotto-voce whisper. ""This place is horrible."" After a few more profane put-downs ""this place"" is revealed to be backstage at New Yorks St. James Theatre where Thomson is directing and starring in an ambitious -- and no doubt profoundly ill-advised -- adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story. As if that bid for artistic legitimacy isnt freighted enough Thomson also is trying to grapple with the personal life he neglected for years while pursuing fame in Hollywood including his fractured relationship with his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) a new girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) and his ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan) who pops in and out of his preparations for opening night like an even-tempered clear-thinking visitor from another far more self-aware planet. From this setup alone ""Birdman"" has all the trappings of a deliciously tawdry backstage satire on a par with ""All About Eve"" and ""Sweet Smell of Success"" but writer-director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu throws in a delightfully wacky monkey wrench in the form of a pretentious actor named Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) whos cast in the play at the last minute when a member of the ensemble is injured (with or without the help of Thomsons Birdman-esque psychic gifts). The moment Shiner appears on the scene the strutting and fretting are kicked up a notch with Norton gleefully even courageously throwing himself into a performance that showcases the subtleties of acting nuance but also makes him look utterly ridiculous as a performer of surpassing arrogance and overweening vanity. Narcissism ambition insecurity and the wages of celebrity are addressed in one fell swoop in ""Birdman"" which Inarritu and his longtime cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have filmed to resemble one long unbroken take -- a stunt that results in a film of delicate even balletic grace and one that poetically captures Thomsons own state of mind. Tuned in hyper-aware Thomson moves through the world on a different frequency than his peers or so he thinks Through just a few casual gestures -- and in one eyepopping set piece -- the complicated contradictory headspace Thomson occupies becomes palpable and real. Once a superstar now human scale he walks the boards and Broadway streets like a hungry ghost searching for the potency his cartoonish persona once conferred while simultaneously trying to escape the culture of pandering and cynicism he helped to create. As much fun as ""Birdman"" is to watch from a sheer technical and aesthetic standpoint it gains untold layers of meaning from the presence of Keaton whose own career as the big-screen Batman that launched a never-ending franchise is clearly one of Inarritus inspirations. As critical as ""Birdman"" is of the idea of the carefully calculated Hollywood comeback (and Lindsay Duncan as a vinegary critic delivers a soaring aria to that effect in one of the films best scenes) the film manages to be just that. Keatons performance both as Thomson and the eminence grise hovering over his shoulder is nothing short of a triumph -- a quiet un-showy one-man master class in humor pathos physical vulnerability and dimly dawning wisdom that seems always to be disappearing around one of the St. Jamess labyrinthine corners. 1 of 8 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad x Michael Keaton From Batman to Birdman View Photos A look back at some of the films the versatile actor has starred in over the years.

AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Keaton is given ample support from a lively limber consistently alert ensemble including the sly scene-stealing Norton the impressively feisty Stone (who delivers another one of the films best verbal solos) Naomi Watts as the productions idealistic ingenue and Zach Galifianakis here almost unrecognizable as the closest thing to a straight man Thomsons best friend and producer. Urged along by a musical score that consists mostly of percussive drumming and snatches of classical pieces the actors gamely hit their marks in a meticulously choreographed dance that swoops and swirls with brash contagious brio. Then theres the supporting character of Manhattan itself portrayed here as a seductive and indifferent bitch-goddess who may tantalize from afar but who can swallow a man whole in less than a New York minute. Inarritu whose films include ""Amores Perros"" ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams"" has always been prone to his own brand of overworked pretentiousness. At the risk of sounding like Duncans sour-faced reviewer his movies are little more than melodramas burnished with the patina of arty conceits and empty formalism. But the bravura gestures work gorgeously in ""Birdman"" as does the humor which playfully balances the films most mystical contemplative ideas with a steady stream of inside jokes and well-calibrated shifts in tone and dynamics. At another time the preoccupations of ""Birdman"" -- with relevance artifice and the meaning of mass acclaim -- might have been considered merely those of the rich and famous. But as Stones character makes forcefully clear technology and social media have made them germane to anyone with an iPhone and a Twitter account. With grandeur giddiness and a humanistic nod toward transcendence ""Birdman"" vividly evokes a time of equal parts possibility and terrifying uncertainty and makes a persuasive case that when the ground is shifting beneath your feet the best thing to do is to take flight.

Photo Courtesy Of Fox Searchlight Pict Birdman review Inarritus fine showbiz satire of ex-superhero 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Any conversation about ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" must begin with a description of how it was filmed. It was shot in long takes many of which involved following characters down hallways and in and out of tight corners and small dressing rooms. Then it was strung together in such a way that it plays as though the entire movie were done in one unbroken shot. This is a remarkable feat not only of cinematography but of choreography. Just to film Michael Keaton and Edward Norton walking down a Manhattan street everything had to be timed as in a dance -- when the camera swirls ahead when it goes behind when it swoops back around. Its all accomplished so smoothly that it would be worth doing merely as a stunt except this is no stunt. This method carries the mood and soul of one of the best movies of 2014. In a way ""Birdman"" is a departure for director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu best known for the heavy dramas ""Babel"" ""21 Grams"" and ""Biutiful."" ""Birdman"" is a heavy-hearted comedy the story of a former superhero actor (Keaton) seeking redemption on Broadway. No trivial satire of Michael Keatons career as the first and best Batman it concerns the torments of a career in the arts -- the awfulness of contending with other egos hostile critics and a loony public. Worst of all theres the crazy voice in your head that tells you all day long at staggered intervals and with sudden and profound revelation that youre a genius and that youre a bum and that you face doom if you dont do this or that immediately. In his previous movies Inarritu has attempted stories on a grand scale but he has been at his best as in ""Biutiful"" in conveying flights of the spirit the journey of a single consciousness colliding with the world. In ""Birdman"" he gives us this effect in pure form without diluting it with over-plotting and multiple locations. Inarritu allows himself the freedom to follow other characters as he should and yet the overall feeling is that of one persons story. This is where the single-take strategy becomes more than a gimmick and becomes an integral part of the movies effect. The camera is as flowing and nimble as any camera has ever been but it cant leap across the universe in the span of a second as in other movies. In that way its like the mind -- specifically like the hothouse of its lead characters mind It can go any way but it cant escape itself. This weird feeling the movie instills a combination of freedom and suffocation of possibility and limitation of grandiosity and despair puts ""Birdman"" in a different class from other show-business satires. But it is indeed a showbiz satire and succeeds on those terms too. Theres a bit of the old The sheer terror of the Broadway critic -- here played with alarming coldness by Lindsay Duncan -- goes back to ""42nd Street"" and beyond. And the impossible but brilliant actor given complexity in Edward Nortons performance is a creature from the dawn of theater. But we get the crazy new world of celebrity too in which once famous you remain famous even if youre washed up and in which a trending video of yourself running down the street in your underwear -- something that in another era might mean humiliation -- constitutes ""power."" As Keatons sullen daughter Emma Stone has never been more vivid neither as an actress nor as a physical entity. Inarritu does her the service of not falling in love with her of seeing her as a mixed-up kid. At one point in the midst of an angry tirade her eyes and mouth begin to look monstrous. A pretty face becomes something more a great movie face. Naomi Watts is poignant and funny as an actress in her 40s finally making it to Broadway. In an inspired bit of casting Zach Galifianakis plays the fretting business manager -- a mostly dramatic role but one that benefits from Galifianakis abandon and timing. Finally and principally theres Keaton -- weathered and full of doubt someone life has rendered too human for superhero antics and yet at the peak of his real and important power his power as an actor. Am I talking about Keaton or the role he plays? In this case Im talking about both. Mick LaSalle is The San Francisco Chronicles movie critic.

"Birdman movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Review Birdman  Video Birdman chooses style over substance but it works Michael Keaton plays a somewhat fictitious version of himself in director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus latest movie ""Birdman"" which film critic Michael Phillips says is ""just plain fun to watch."" Michael Keaton plays a somewhat fictitious version of himself in director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus latest movie ""Birdman"" which film critic Michael Phillips says is ""just plain fun to watch."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Movies about putting on a play are rarely so kinetic. ""Birdman"" proves that a movie -- the grabbiest most kinetic film ever made about putting on a play -- can soar on the wings of its own technical prowess even as the banality of its ideas threatens to drag it back down to earth.Much of what youve heard is true. The movies just plain fun to watch. Its star Michael Keaton is someone everyone likes and many love an actor who made millions on ""Batman"" and settled for a different level of fame and smaller pieces of smaller pies. Already Keaton has gotten a career reboot out of ""Birdman"" and hes a cinch for an Academy Award nomination. The visual conceit of ""Birdman"" is simple yet striking. It unfolds in long several-minute takes and roving prowling tracking shots stitched together both practically (the way Hitchcocks ""Rope"" was) and digitally to lend the impression of a sustained backstage onstage above-stage and streetscape diary of a movie star in rehearsal and in various stages of panic mode. The story spans several days en route to opening night on Broadway.Co-writer and director Alejandro G. Inarritu and his brilliant cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki are going for a complementary bookend to ""Gravity"" for which Lubezki won an Oscar. This is ""Levity"" at least by the 10-ton gravely pompous standards of the Inarritu who gave us ""Babel"" and ""Biutiful."" For better or worse ""Birdman"" is a movie in which things happen to and around the faded movie star at its center as opposed to a narrative propelled by the character. Keaton plays Riggan Thomson a fictionalized version of Keaton himself right down to the shared number of syllables in both names. Thomson is adapting directing and starring in a stage version of the Raymond Carver short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" thick with the themes of ego suicide love ex-spouses and other regrets.The gods appear to be against his endeavor. A mediocre actor gets conked on the head during a rehearsal Thomson is forced to recast the role. Another cast member played by Naomi Watts has an angle on nabbing a famous Method actor (played by Edward Norton sending up his own difficult reputation with delightful aplomb) on short notice. Hes in and before long hes lecturing Thomson and dropping axioms such as ""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" Video Birdman trailer ""Birdman"" is a comedy starring Michael Keaton Lindsay Duncan Zack Galifianakis Edward Norton and Andrea Riseborough. The film is the story of an actor gearing up for a Broadway play. ""Birdman"" is a comedy starring Michael Keaton Lindsay Duncan Zack Galifianakis Edward Norton and Andrea Riseborough. The film is the story of an actor gearing up for a Broadway play. See more videos As Thomsons final preview performances careen from disaster to disaster ""Birdman"" flies all over the place its place being Broadways St. James Theatre on 44th Street in midtown Manhattan. Scenes are placed in the catwalks above the stage in various dressing rooms and in tentative romantic interludes between Norton and Emma Stone the latter playing Thomsons daughter recently out of rehab and still smarting over how little her dad was around.Against a terrific percussion-based soundtrack from Antonio Sanchez ""Birdman"" sounds a chorus of actorly insecurities populated by lost souls hung up on whom they love or whom they should love and their own fragile yet monstrously scaled egos. None has a more corroded soul than The New York Times drama critic (Lindsay Duncan mean as a snake) who informs Thomson at a bar one evening that come opening night she will be destroying his efforts. Why? Because hes Hollywood not Broadway. Throughout the film the masked and winged superhero Thomson once played in the movies mumbles insults or provocations in his ear and eventually makes an on-screen appearance. A homeless man (Bill Camp) rants his way through the ""tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"" speech from ""Macbeth"" at one point which brings up the question Is ""Birdman"" full of sound and fury signifying much of anything really? Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. Not a great deal I think. Formally bold but thematically timid its selling a familiar line of goods and it goes easy on its main character. Thomson were told cheated on his wife and wasnt much of a father but well whatever. Hes a dreamer a striver. Inarritu has discussed in various interviews how ""Birdman"" grew out of his own egocentric demons and its his attempt to lighten up. Hes clearly striking back at his own critics by way of the pathologically adversarial drama critic played by Duncan. Yet the director who wrote his script with Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo acknowledges in ""Birdman"" that those critics may have been right about the near-fatal levels of self-seriousness in Inarritus earlier work.The viewer can take ""Birdman"" as capital-M Meaningful or else as pleasantly devoid of deep thoughts. Its the same sensory experience either way. The verbal wit cannot possibly compete with the things the cameras doing. The inside jokes include digs at Meg Ryans plastic surgery and Keatons own wobbly fame post-""Batman."" The actor runs through Times Square in his underwear in ""Birdman""; more challengingly he wrestles with some predictable soul-searching dialogue passages in his dressing room or in the wings mixing it up with his skeptical producer (Zach Galifianakis) or gauging his own feelings regarding his actress lover of the moment (Andrea Riseborough).If you crave a black comedy of serious nerve and truly abrasive wit also dealing with an egocentric artist Alex Ross Perrys ""Listen Up Philip"" opens this weekend along with ""Birdman.""

Keaton plays a washed-up actor who tries to reclaim his past glory with a Broadway play. VPC Bill Goodykoontz USA TODAY NETWORK 1139 a.m. MST October 24 2014Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus film about an actor (Michael Keaton) trying to regain credibility by staging a Broadway show is brilliant.""Birdman"" | Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. | Cast Michael Keaton Edward Norton Zach Galifianakis. | Rating R for language throughout some sexual content and brief violence. | An amazing movie that delves into the worlds of theater film and celebrity directed with great skill and passion by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.(Photo Fox Searchlight Pictures)Story HighlightsCritics review 5 starsKeaton and Norton have the difficult task of playing actors acting and pull it off superbly.The film is shot as if in one take.The film demands your attention but its well worth it.""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is an amazing movie that delves into the worlds of theater film and celebrity directed with great skill and passion by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.The acting is also terrific with Michael Keaton giving one of his best performances ever. Edward Norton stands toe-to-toe with him (sometimes literally). Its a film that rewards effort from the audience practically demands it yet its entertaining as hell.So yes if you cant tell already its one of the best movies of the year.Goodykoontz All his 5-star movie reviewsKeaton plays Riggan Thompson who a couple of decades previously had become a big star playing superhero Birdman before leaving the franchise to try to stretch himself as an actor.Of course Keaton who twice played Batman did much the same thing.So is he playing a character loosely based on himself? Keaton says no and it doesnt really matter. Its a complete performance no matter where it comes from.Related azcentral.coms newest movie reviews | Fall movie guideThe first time we see Riggan hes in a dressing room meditating in his underwear -- and floating a few feet above the floor. The film delves occasionally into these instances of magical realism. Or is it merely insanity? Inarritu is not offering easy answers.The reason Riggan is in a dressing room is that he is mounting a Broadway production based on a Raymond Carver story that he has adapted directs and stars in as an attempt to regain credibility in a world that 20 years later still eagerly awaits ""Birdman 3.""The production is not going smoothly and no one doubts its future more than Riggan himself. These doubts are expressed in a disturbing way that begins immediately but is understood only over time.One of the actors is injured in an on-set accident and is replaced by the respected-but-difficult stage actor Mike Shiner (Norton) whose brilliance is matched by his arrogance. He blurts out nuggets like ""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" He drinks real gin onstage; compliments Sam (Emma Stone) Riggans fresh-out-of-rehab daughter on her backside; shows utter disdain for his fellow actors and the audience; and yet unquestionably ups the ante with ability.""Birdman"" is shot as if it were one continuous take and it deftly weaves surreal and magical elements into the action. (Photo Fox Searchlight Pictures)The pressure mounts as opening night nears. Riggans ex-wife (Amy Ryan) shows up to wish him luck. His girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) one of the co-stars has worries of her own that extend beyond the production. His lawyer and self-proclaimed ""best friend"" (Zach Galifianakis) is trying to secure last-minute funding.And those self-doubts are getting louder and more dangerous.The acting is spot-on brilliant in every case. And we havent even mentioned that Inarritu shoots the film as if in a single extended take. Its remarkable yet never draws attention to itself for its own sake. The plot is as intricate as the patterns the actors follow as they careen down the hallways backstage before reaching the stage.Its tricky an actor playing an actor who is acting (even the description is meta enough to cause a headache). Keaton and Norton pull it off superbly and from different angles. Riggan must struggle to gain his stage footing -- there are more doubts afoot than his own -- while Shiner is a brilliant handful. We believe both.Think of the acidic fencing between Riggan and a New York Times critic (Lindsay Duncan) in a bar as well as the special effects (yes) as gravy.""Birdman"" is a treat. But its also more than that. Its a full-fledged wonder.Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)5 starsDirector Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.Cast Michael Keaton Edward Norton Zach Galifianakis.Rating R for language throughout some sexual content and brief violence.Note At Harkins Camelview.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

And it is though thats not intended as a put-down.Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus surreal head-tripper is one of 2014s most innovative movies an energetic and exciting existential black comedy one thats challenging yet accessible and wildly successful in the risks it takes. It also comes from a fearless filmmaker whos passionate about the themes he tackles head on. Case in point ""Babel"" his intense 2005 multinarrative drama about the ripple effect our actions have on an international scale. Other films that have burrowed into audiences psyches include the wrenching ""21 Grams"" the powerful ""Amores Perros"" and the tear-out-your-heart drama ""Biutiful."" The sometimes hilarious ""Birdman"" is a departure for a director known for such bleak material and it is though once again its a very human story about flawed people. Inarritu and co-screenwriters Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo propel us through the experiences of a former superhero star (a brilliant Michael Keaton) as he comes undone while putting the finishing touches on a Broadway production he hopes will revitalize his career. Like the film itself the screenplay is exuberantly daring. Through wicked doses of pathos and humor ""Birdman"" uses the stage as a metaphor to express our quest for identity meaning and love while showing our desire to do something anything of significance during our short span on this planet. Advertisement It achieves all that from the viewpoint of the former ""Birdman"" superhero actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton) as he wrestles his demons and tries to keep the gruff-sounding alter ego hes been chained to at bay. Birdman who appears to Riggan in costume every so often represents his dark side.Through a bold storytelling technique we watch the cast perform ""scenes"" in a series of long-take sequences made possible through the use of Steadicams and hand-held cameras. The duo largely responsible for making this work are Inarritu and director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki who sent into orbit ""Gravitys"" 10-minute-plus jaw-dropping opening shot. But ""Birdman"" also involves actors making the process even more complicated.What could have been a look-at-how-cool-we-are gimmick gives the film an electrified anything-goes vibrancy that makes the audience privy to the up-and-down backstage preparations for a play based on the late Raymond Carvers short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" (Fans of Carver will especially appreciate this since much of what transpires feels emblematic of the writers haunting work.) Michael Keaton and Edward Norton in Birdman. (Alison Rosa/Fox Searchlight) ( Alison Rosa/Fox Searchlight ) To pull this off though you need a great cast and ""Birdman"" has one. Keaton is unforgettable as Riggan the actor hounded and pigeonholed by the Birdman franchise. Its a cheeky casting coup since Keatons probably best known for starring in two Tim Burton ""Batman"" movies in 1989 and 1992. No wonder theres already talk hes the Oscar front-runner.Equally good is Edward Norton as Mike Shiner a Method actor who may be a diva jerk but he has serious problems of his own. Norton is marvelous here hilariously pretentious one moment suddenly vulnerable the next. Mike is a last-minute replacement after an unfortunate accident takes out the lead. His friend Lesley (Naomi Watts) is getting her first break in the play and suggests him for the role. The self-important Mike immediately clashes with Riggan and the two come to fisticuffs in one of the films funniest scenes. Then theres Sam (Emma Stone) Riggans fresh-from-rehab daughter and personal assistant who finds herself strangely attracted to Mike. While all thats going down the plays producer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) tries to keep everything from capsizing but thats a hard task since Riggans girlfriend Laura (Andrea Riseborough) is feeling ignored. Meanwhile surly bitter theater critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan finding venom in every word shes presented with) vows to close the play down from the start. The only one who truly seems to have it all together is Riggans ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan).Every actor is terrific with Stone giving her best performance as well. Her meltdown with her dad is one of the films most agonizing sequences the camera held steady on her wounding explosive rant.""Birdman"" soars in particular thanks to that performance and those by Keaton Norton and Duncan. The greatest contributor though remains Inarritu. He has achieved just as his Oscar-winning contemporary Alfonso Cuaron did with ""Gravity"" a spellbindingly unique experience that will leave you dazed and exhilarated.

"Birdman | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; birdman ) Birdman (United States 2014) October 17 2014 A movie review by James Berardinelli Birdman (subtitled Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is an ensemble film about theater life that occasionally takes time away from its dramatic/comedic narrative to skewer the pop culture sensibilities that have given rise to the so-called ""modern blockbuster."" Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu the film occasionally ventures into Spike Jonze territory making the viewer uncertain whether certain bizarre interludes are depictions of the main characters mental instability or actual events. The movie is punctuated by comedy that at times verges on slapstick but theres an underlying anger in evidence - anger at the popular mindset that allows movies like Transformers to flourish while artistic endeavors fail. At the focal point of Birdman is aging actor Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton). Twenty years ago he was a household name as the star of the mega-successful Birdman superhero franchise. After the second sequel however he turned his attention to other things none of which were successful. Now in an attempt to prove he can do something other than Birdman he has adapted a Raymond Carver short story into a play thats in previews for a Broadway opening. In addition to being the writer Riggan is also the director and star. As opening day approaches he is understandably nervous. His cast consists of Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) a genuine talent with a deserved reputation for upstaging directors; his old friend Lesley (Naomi Watts) who is realizing a lifelong dream of appearing in a Broadway production; and his lover Laura (Andrea Riseborough) who is disappointed about a false pregnancy. His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) recently out of rehab is hanging around backstage and his best friend/manager Brandon (Zach Galifianakis) is trying to hold everything together. Meanwhile the vultures - in the person of the influential New York Times theater critic (Lindsay Duncan) - are circling. One of the most notable aspects of Birdman for good or ill is the manner in which Inarritu a notoriously unconventional director whose previous endeavors include 21 Grams and Babel has chosen to make the movie. With the aid of digital editing to erase the seams Birdman appears to have been filmed in a single unbroken take (excepting a short prologue and epilogue). This is partially illusion but the actors have spoken about having to recite page after page of dialogue while hitting their marks so the stylistic conceit has its roots in reality. Although this is a unique approach (especially in an era when long takes have become increasingly rare replaced by rapid-fire ADD editing) and emphasizes the ""theatrical"" elements of the narrative one could ask the legitimate question of whether it becomes a distraction. Does the style become so cumbersome that it detracts from the narrative? There are instances when I would argue that the answer is ""yes."" Consider for example the visual contortions when the camera has to navigate corridors in order to follow a character or when theres a time lapse to indicate the passage of time. Inarritu unquestionably has an ax to grind and he has honed the edge. By contrasting theater with cinema he is able to posit that the former represents ""art"" while the latter is overcome by crass commercialism. He has a little fun with this concept - theres a scene in which he indulges himself by trying his hand at a little Michael Bay-style mayhem. (This by the way is the movies most logistically challenging sequence - presenting an alien/monster attack without cutting.) He uses the fictional Birdman as a stand-for Batman the role Michael Keaton played until 1992 (the year Riggan quit the Birdman franchise). And in addition to Keaton he employs two actors who have had major roles in superhero franchises (Edward Norton who played the title role in The Incredible Hulk and Emma Stone Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man and its sequel). The performances are uniformly excellent. This is the best work Michael Keaton has done in years. Edward Norton is in fine form in a role that allows him to poke fun at his own reputation while simultaneously creating a new and memorable character. His portrayal of Mike Shiner is riveting. Emma Stone Andrea Riseborough and Naomi Watts all contribute. Lindsay Duncan has a small but memorable part as an acerbic theater critic - its hard to decide based on this portrayal how Inarritu feels about the profession although its clear he believes critics wield too much influence for the effort they put forth. (This may have once been true but especially in the internet era could be disputed today.) There are times when the dialogue in Birdman verges on the pretentious but the quality of acting covers some flaws and the overall storyline is so compelling that its easy to forgive some of the movies excesses. The film also includes its share of laugh-out-loud moments - Michael Keaton navigating Times Square in his underwear comes to mind. The girl/girl kiss seems gratuitous but Im not going to complain. Overall Birdman offers two hours of thought-provoking entertainment. For those who have grown weary of the multiplex blockbuster culture its refreshing to have a filmmaker join the choir. And in an era when far too many directors play it safe Inarritus penchant for the quirky and outrageous offers a welcome change-of-pace even if it doesnt always work. Birdman wont find many adherents among the TransformersA!-loving crowd but for the rest of us it says a lot of things worth hearing.

Atsushi Nishijima/ Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Atsushi Nishijima/ Fox Searchlight In Birdman Michael Keaton (a real-life former Batman) plays a former movie superhero whos trying to get a grasp on his career. Atsushi Nishijima/ Fox Searchlight Birdmans opening shot has a meteor flaring across a twilit sky -- a dying star falling to earth being an apt first image for a movie about a film superhero who has flamed out. The next shot shows whats happened to him ex-Birdman Riggan Thomson (played by ex-Batman Michael Keaton) facing away from the camera in yoga position in his dressing room at Broadways St. James Theater. As Riggan attempts a comeback on stage director Alejandro Inarritus camera will follow him seemingly without a single edit for almost two hours a stunt well come back to. But first lets note one odd thing about the way Riggan is sitting. He is floating in lotus position about 3 feet off the ground. One other oddity In his head he hears his own accusing voice amplified the way it was decades earlier when he was Birdman. ""How did we end up here?"" the voice growls. ""This place is horrible. Smells like balls. You were a movie star remember?"" Now with the last bit of cash from that stardom Riggan is producing his own Broadway adaptation of the Raymond Carver short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" directed by and starring himself. Its whats known in the trade as a vanity production -- his possibly pregnant girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) is in it his stoner daughter (Emma Stone) is his personal assistant his very nervous best friend (Zack Galifianakis) is stage manager. And after a -- um lets go with ""lucky"" backstage accident its a vanity production minus one co-star. Happily a stage star whos just quit/been fired from another gig is almost literally waiting in the wings having helped his girlfriend (Naomi Watts) learn her lines. And while he comes with his own baggage -- where the original co-star couldnt express emotions Mike is constantly exploding -- the play starts previews tomorrow so what the hell. i Mike (Edward Norton) has a tendency to explode on set. Courtesy of Fox Searchlight hide caption toggle caption Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Mike (Edward Norton) has a tendency to explode on set. Courtesy of Fox Searchlight This guy is played by Edward Norton who is also an ex-superhero in real life (his Hulk remember had explosion issues) and the celebrity in-jokes dont end with the casting. Keaton recounts a nightmare in which hes upstaged at his own funeral by (wink wink) George Clooney and there are savagely funny swipes at critics in-the-know observations about the price of fame not to mention a nifty literary riff on that Carver short story Riggan has supposedly adapted for the stage but thats actually taking over his life. Read it before you go and youll marvel at the films intricate plotting. All part of the entertainingly complicated jigsaw puzzle Inarritu has made of Birdman. His full title is Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) but rest assured the more you know the more fun itll be -- all real-life connections fodder for other connections as the film shreds time fame family and the difference between movie acting and stage acting. That one-continuous-tracking shot conceit is designed to split the difference forcing the actors to play through long stretches -- no cuts to protect them -- as the camera zips after them down hallways into theaters empty and full and at one deliriously funny point out into a Times Square mobbed with celebrity-chasers. But its also a stupendously choreographed bit of camerawork demanding not just for actors who mustve been forever ducking into closets and behind furniture but also for cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki the miracle worker who designed those breath-catchingly lengthy tracking shots in Alfonso Cuarons Children of Men and who figured out how to open Gravity with a 14-minute tour-de-force single take in outer space. Doing a whole movie this way isnt unprecedented of course. Hitchcocks Rope did it without digital trickery more than half a century ago. Still its a great cinematic stunt even when you think youve found the hidden edits. And it makes Birdman as exhilarating a flight of fantasy as youre likely to see anytime soon.

As the director adapter financer and star of a show staged at the venerable St. James Theatre and based on a Raymond Carver short story he wants to do something that he at long last can be proud of.Keaton of course was the original movie Batman and gifted as he is his subsequent acting career has been decidedly hit-or-miss (mostly miss). His casting as Riggan inevitably carries thick overtones from his own career. The entire film which is being hailed as a commentary on the perils of fame and ambition is very meta.Expertly filmed by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (""Gravity"") to simulate one sinuously continuous shot the movie wavers tonally in and out of backstage Broadway farce literal flights of fancy and realism both hard-bitten and magical. (A jazz drumbeat courtesy of Antonio Sanchez is the films propulsive obbligato along with snatches of Mahler and Rachmaninoff for that glorioso effect.) Fantasizing he can levitate objects Riggan is shadowed by his Birdman character which he alone can see and who is also played by Keaton who taunts him for his artistic ambitions. Recommended The 50 best movies of all time Along for the ride are the shows lead actress Lesley (Naomi Watts); her celebrated actor boyfriend Mike (Edward Norton); and their costar Laura (Andrea Riseborough). Riggans you-never-had-time-for-me-growing-up daughter Sam (a fine Emma Stone) fresh out of rehab is his caustic personal assistant. Zach Galifianakis is Riggans loyal lawyer and producer. Together they constitute a randy cadre of yammerers whose carnal hookups essentially go nowhere. The 50 best movies of all time Monitor Movie Guide For a movie that is supposed to be about the nature of fame and the perils of artistic ambition ""Birdman"" which Inarritu co-wrote with Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo never makes the case that Riggan had a talent worth redeeming. Are we supposed to think he was a great actor done in by Hollywood which made it impossible for him to do ""meaningful"" work? But as even ""Birdman"" acknowledges there are numerous examples of terrific actors such as Robert Downey Jr. and Michael Fassbender who have been able to straddle that fence. Mainlining glib pathos ""Birdman"" posits a showbiz world where commercial and artistic success must be mutually exclusive.Is Riggan even a good actor? The snippets of him acting onstage in the Carver show (based on his classic story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"") reveal a fidgety ham. Why then should we care about the ambitions of a mediocre actor with delusions of artistic grandeur? We might indeed care with a different kind of movie - more Chekhovian than this meta-muddle that tries to have it every which way. Wised-up as it tries to be ""Birdman"" nevertheless thumps for the hoariest cliches about self-actualization. Riggan must learn to love himself before he can learn to love others. For a movie that in a rooftop scene between Sam and Mike takes a swipe at Oprahs pseudo-profundities this is pretty rich. Keaton doesnt pull out the stops which is probably a good thing but his tightly controlled indrawn performance has its fair share of blahness. He is getting praised in the press for not disguising his thinning hairline or his wrinkles - in other words for being ""truthful."" But this sort of exposure is literally skin-deep (and by the way represents a species of actors vanity - the vanity of no vanity - that is often garlanded with Oscars). Norton is much livelier and his character more complicated Mike is a poseur who is also the real deal. His bullying script suggestions are always spot on.""Birdman"" pretends to be very ""knowing"" about the state of Broadway and of Hollywood and yet its often tone-deaf. Movie stars sell tickets on Broadway all right but not all of them are seeking redemption. Some of them just want to act on Broadway. And Broadway has been the siren call for movie actors ever since movies were invented. What doesnt ring true here is the way the audience oohs and aahs - rightly we are made to feel - at scenes from the Carver play that make us wince. (For this sort of thing I much prefer ""The Producers."") There is also a scene in which the chief New York Times drama critic (Lindsay Duncan) tells Riggan that without having even seen it in preview she will ""kill"" his play because he represents everything she hates about the current celebrity-pandering state of theater.This comes off like a preemptive strike against all those critics who might have the temerity to take aim at ""Birdman"" a movie with ambitions as high-flying as its superhero but a success rate decidedly lower to the ground.

"Review Unlike Icarus this scorching Birdman soars unfettered - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Birdman soars feathered and unfettered A scene from Birdman Atsushi Nishijima / Fox Searchlight Pictures Michael Keaton may never be better than his role in ""Birdman"" which is brilliant on several levels as it presents a scathing look at the cult of celebrity. Michael Keaton may never be better than his role in ""Birdman"" which is brilliant on several levels as it presents a scathing look at the cult of celebrity. (Atsushi Nishijima / Fox Searchlight Pictures) Betsy Sharkey Unlike Icarus our modern-day Birdman sees Michael Keaton soar feathered and unfettered In ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" Michael Keaton is something of a cross between an aging Icarus and the emperor with no clothes -- metaphorical until the tighty-whitey Times Square streak.As a latter-day celluloid superhero come to Broadways proving ground for a rebirth the Burning Man histrionics on stage and off are hysterically on point; makes you laugh makes you cry. Irony lurks in every shadow. Fittingly the film begins with a fiery object -- A bird? A plane? A meteor? -- cutting through cotton-candy clouds above Manhattan where the highly agitated life of the actor Riggan (Keaton) plays out. The city as it happens is the perfect spot for filmmaker Alejandro G. Inarritu to build his pyre. Exactly whose death is being celebrated or mourned -- Hollywood? Theater? Society? A single shooting star? -- well that is the question.Oscars 2015 Full coverage And oh the flames that follow. Delicious.They rise and rise almost as high as Keaton and Inarritu who unlike Icarus know precisely how to calibrate this flight of fancy for maximum effect. Indeed the directors surrealist portrait of modern times and the cult of celebrity is brilliant on so many levels that even the occasional downdraft cant keep ""Birdman"" from soaring. Hollywood Sessions Why Michael Keaton loved watching Birdman Michael Keaton talks about the making of ""Birdman"" with Eddie Redmayne Robert Downey Jr. Benedict Cumberbatch and Steve Carell in ""Hollywood Sessions."" Michael Keaton talks about the making of ""Birdman"" with Eddie Redmayne Robert Downey Jr. Benedict Cumberbatch and Steve Carell in ""Hollywood Sessions."" See more videos But Keaton isnt flying solo. Hes got an incredible troupe of supporting players chief among them Edward Norton burning almost as white-hot as Broadway bad boy Mike and Emma Stone adding her own maelstrom. As Riggans barely post-rehab daughter Sam the actress walks that knifes edge between imploding and exploding with demanding saucer-sized eyes that dwarf Gollums.The director who wrote the screenplay with Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris Jr. and Armando Bo piles on a polyglot of social dynamics filmmaking tropes stage traditions and every type of ego that has ever intersected with the culture of fame Actors from A-list to Z directors fans friends family critics lovers haters social media and film itself. The directors surrealist portrait of modern times and the cult of celebrity is brilliant on so many levels that even the occasional downdraft cant keep ""Birdman"" from soaring. Now to the bird and the man. They are both embodied in Keaton voiced by him. Riggan is an actor of a certain age -- no wrinkle too deep no hairpiece too horrible no indignity too embarrassing to escape this dark lens. Riggan is also in a constant debate with his alter-ego. That would be the Hollywood creation that made his career a.k.a. Birdman all black latex feathers attitude and no doubt a Comic-Con showstopper back in the day. The bird is disgusted with Riggans notion that the theater is the right stage for his comeback especially when movies are all.Their debates are lively to say the least a running tease that Inarritu employs to drift into magically mystifying altered states as he shuffles reality and fantasy like a stacked deck. In fact the very construction of ""Birdman"" down to its bones is a separate work of art.Kevin Thompsons production design is like a living creature. Most of the action takes place in the complex backstage maze of a Broadway theater where hallway passing becomes a feint and turn affair of bodies in tight spaces. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki who won an Oscar last year for sending us out of this world in ""Gravity"" is masterful in taking us down the rabbit hole in takes so long they leave you breathless. The sound and editing teams do not miss a beat. The music alone merits its own review. The film is framed by Antonio Sanchezs evocative drum score and lifted by symphonic swells that milk every melodramatic quote-unquote movie moment with a sly sarcasm that is as loving as it is biting.It is not just Birdmans nagging that is befuddling Riggan. The actor is dealing -- badly -- with tension on all fronts though in truth the plays the thing. Riggan is not only star but playwright adapting from one of Raymond Carvers indelible short stories ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" and director.The plays setup is two couples getting drunk on gin and arguing over what real love is. On stage and backstage Riggan is grappling with his deconstructing cast. In addition to himself -- a battle he seems to be losing -- there is a current lover possibly pregnant Laura (Andrea Riseborough ); fading movie star dreaming of her Broadway debut Lesley (Naomi Watts); and Nortons Mike Lesleys loose cannon of a boyfriend but a highly bankable Broadway commodity.Watching Norton and Keaton as Mike and Riggan run lines for the first time -- feeling each other out pressing each others buttons -- is wicked fun. Their warring bravado brings out the worst in the characters the best in the actors throughout the film.As Inarritu is wont to do hes loaded ""Birdman"" with intricately interconnected subplots. Remember the mosaic of political and social clashes that was ""Babel""? One Oscar six more nominations?Zach Galifianakis as Jake Riggans longtime manager lawyer best friend plays wonderfully against type -- one of the few centered souls in this crazy world. Lindsay Duncan as Tabitha a bitter New York Times theater critic/barfly intent on Riggans public demise is pricelessly scathing while the tenderness between Riggan and his ex Sylvia (Amy Ryan) is exactly what we talk about when we talk about love.The side stories swirling around Stone ring with the anger and impatience of youth with age and are among the best. They play out in Sams fractious relationship with her father and the truth-or-dare rooftop flirtation she takes up with Mike. Truth Both have their distinct charms.But just as the stage belongs to Riggan ""Birdman"" belongs to Keaton. It is one of those performances that is so intensely truthful so eerily in the moment so effortless in making fantasy reality and reality fantasy that it is hard to imagine Keaton will ever be better. But Keaton from ""Batman"" before or beyond is one talent you should never count out.Twitter BetseySharkey--------------------------------Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) MPAA rating R for language throughout some sexual content and brief violence.Running time 1 hour 59 minutes Playing ArcLight Hollywood; Landmark Theatres West Los Angeles Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Entertainment Column Broadway Theater Michael Keaton Birdman Reviews Watch Qamp;As with the Birdman cast and crew Birdman trailer Read more movie reviews gt;gt; In Birdman Alejandro G.

Rated R (profanity sexuality violence). At the Lincoln Square and the Angelika. Michael Keaton goes from ""the answer to a Trivial Pursuit question"" -- as his character puts it -- to serious Best Actor Oscar contender in ""Birdman"" a manic black satire of Broadway in which he triumphs over not only his scene-stealing co-star Edward Norton but a flashy directorial tour de force. This movie is painstakingly staged and edited by director and co-writer Alejandro Inarittu (""Babel"") and his team to resemble a single unbroken scene meant to simulate the tortured psyche of Riggan Thomson a washed-up actor who is (like former-movie-Batman Keaton) haunted by his long-ago film role as a superhero named Birdman. Thomson has decided to restart his moribund career by starring in his own self-financed adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver -- and hes raised the stakes on the risky undertaking by also making his directing debut on Broadway. The film hilariously covers the show from previews through opening night a period during which pretty much everything that can go wrong does go wrong. It doesnt at all help that at the last minute Riggan impulsively replaces his second male lead with Mike (a self-satirizing Edward Norton) a flamboyant uber-Method actor whose relationship with Riggans co-star (Naomi Watts) is badly fraying. Even as Mike is usurping Riggans directorial prerogatives and his press coverage our heros own girlfriend (and second female lead played by Andrea Riseborough) is announcing shes pregnant. Michael Keaton and Edward Norton in ""Birdman.""Photo AP Adding considerably to the offstage drama is Riggans estranged daughter (Emma Stone) whom hes hired as his personal assistant straight off a stint in rehab. Riggans paranoia is further raised by an encounter with a snobbish New York Times drama critic (Lindsay Duncan) who makes no secret of what she thinks of movie stars slumming on Broadway -- and taunts from Riggans winged alter ego that hed be better off accepting an offer for a fourth Birdman movie than risk embarrassment on the stage. Even with the support of his long-suffering manager (an agreeably cast-against-type Zach Galifianakis) and ex-wife (Amy Ryan) its small wonder that former substance abuser Riggan falls off the wagon and lands on social media for his antics in Times Square. Most of the action takes place in Broadways historic St. James Theatre where Oscar-winning director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki (""Gravity"") relentlessly whips his camera around the characters both onstage and through the corridors leading into their dressing rooms even venturing onto the roof for one scene where Mike tries to put the make on Riggans daughter. It takes a towering central performance by Keaton -- who doffs his hairpiece and goes deep as a narcissistic actor desperately in search of himself -- to keep ""Birdman"" from turning into an elaborate stunt like Alfred Hitchcocks single-take ""Rope."" Instead its perhaps the most incisive and funniest Hollywood take on Broadway since Mel Brooks original ""The Producers.""

CAST Michael Keaton Edward Norton Emma Stone Zach Galifianakis LENGTH 159 Michael Keaton is the star of ""Birdman"" but is he in fact Birdman? The actor who last portrayed Batman in 1992 plays Riggan Thomson an actor who last portrayed a superhero named Birdman in 1992. Hmmm. Unlike Riggan however Keaton isnt desperately trying to turn a Raymond Carver story into a Broadway play. Nor does he possess -- as far as we know -- telekinetic powers that may be delusions manufactured by an overstressed mind. That off-kilter combination of fact and fiction runs throughout this dizzyingly clever movie whose full title is ""Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)."" Full of strange references self-reflexive jokes and a cast of actors playing actors its a maze of mirrors that shifts under your feet like a theme park ride. You could spend the whole time trying to maintain your balance but the best approach is to simply enjoy the ride.

Alternately helping and hindering him are his recovering-addict daughter Sam (Emma Stone); his fairly stable lead actress Lesley (Naomi Watts) and volatile co-star Mike Shiner (Edward Norton); and his menschy manager Jake (Zach Galifianakis). Also bouncing between dressing rooms are his ex-wife and new girlfriend played by Amy Ryan and a venomously funny Andrea Riseborough respectively. Alejandro G. Inarritu known for portentous dramas like ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel"" co-wrote ""Birdman"" (with Rockville Centres Alexander Dinelaris Jr. among others) and directs it with turbo-thrust energy. Slapstick and one-liners share space with lines so poetic -- many shared by Stone and Norton in some truly moving scenes -- that you barely have time to react. The score composed and bashed out almost entirely by the jazz drummer Antonio Sanchez provides comic rimshots and jittery energy. Keaton our guide throughout is marvelous funny wounded pathetic and heroic all at once. Like no other movie this year ""Birdman"" is an absolute blast.

Claudia Puig USA TODAY 1009 p.m. EST November 23 2014Michael Keaton as washed-up actor Riggan Thomson in a scene from ""Birdman.""(Photo Atsushi Nishijima Fox Searchlight Pictures)Skip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Birdman features an all-star cast of Michael Keaton Edward Norton Zach Galifianakis Emma Stone and Naomi Watts. Keaton plays a washed-up actor who tries to reclaim his past glory with a Broadway play. VPCBirdman or (The Unexpected Virture of Ignorance) wears its plucky lunacy proudly.One of the years most audacious savagely funny and unpredictable films it features an outstanding performance by Michael Keaton as the has-been star of a superhero franchise desperate to be taken seriously ( 1/2 out of four; rated R opens Friday nationwide).Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus virtuoso filmmaking employs a hand-held camera continuously flowing down hallways nipping on and off stage and bobbing in and out of dressing rooms. Crackling dialogue offers whip-smart observations about human nature -- usually the worst of it. By focusing on the specific problems of a man undergoing a midlife meltdown Birdman delivers an incisive commentary on celebrity culture ambition social media and fractured families.Keaton plays Riggan Thomson famous for having played the lead role in a Hollywood superhero movie called Birdman. But what Riggan seeks now that hes eligible for the AARP is respect. To that end he writes directs and stars in a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story.His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) argues that the play is less about art and more about Riggans need to feel relevant again.""Youre doing this because youre scared to death that you dont matter"" she tells him.Casting Keaton was inspired. Having played the title character in the 1989 Batman and 1992s Batman Returns Keaton brilliantly inhabits the role of a washed-up star cracking under the pressure of a Broadway opening. Hes supremely self-involved vengeful and not as smart as hed like to think. Keaton has been somewhat of a no-show on movie screens in the past decade except for some little-seen independent films. It would not be a stretch to imagine the actor looking to reinvent himself in a fashion similar to Riggans.As Birdman Riggan can fly and use telekinetic powers. As a balding intermittent charmer he seeks to change minds and dazzle audiences with his serious acting skills. But stumbling blocks abound.Prone to tantrums he doesnt exactly inspire confidence. But the show somehow goes on. We meet Riggan just as play previews begin. At the last minute he replaces an overacting performer with Broadway golden boy Mike (a terrific Ed Norton) whose faltering relationship with leading lady Lesley (Naomi Watts) threatens to derail the show. Riggan and Mike lock horns in some of the films most compelling scenes.Keaton is pitch-perfect as a man in the throes of an existential crisis. His performance is disturbing and magnetic.Hes not however just a foolish movie star hellbent on his vanity project. Haunted by his past the masked avian superhero figures prominently into Riggans delusions. USA TODAYA guide to Michael Keatons nuttiest rolesAs Riggan battles demons he imagines that he has Birdmans abilities. Inarritu weaves Riggans surreal wish-fulfillment fantasies so deftly into the films structure that its sometimes hard to tell where reality leaves off and delusion picks up.At its heart Birdman is about creativity.Like Whiplash it focuses on a man teetering on the edge of sanity in his single-minded focus to leave a mark on the world. A sense of creative urgency coupled with anxiety infuses both films.Birdman plunges the audience into a state of riveted heightened apprehension then catapults viewers to bizarre heights. It can be exhausting but supremely exhilarating.Brace yourself for a breathlessly heady flight into the stratosphere as Birdman soars. 150 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1sXT3jG",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2014/10/16/birdman-review/17343667/,200,birdman30,birdman,usatoday

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet For Michael Keaton Birdman is some kind of gift from the movie gods a license to have his cake and messily devour it too. Its the casting coup of the year aging former movie star who once played a winged superhero returns as an aging former movie star who once played a winged superhero. The role custom-fitted to Keatons true Hollywood story allows him to toy with his own faded celebrity and to step back (however briefly) into the vulcanized rubber of a crime-fighting getup. Invisible quotation marks flutter like bats around the actors head fortifying his performance with context and subtext. Cursed/blessed with terrible facial hair and always walking or yelling or arguing with himself Keaton hasnt seemed this alive in years. Maybe ever.Same goes for Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu unlikeliest of directors to tackle a playful self-consciously meta showbiz comedy. Under his stewardship Birdman is less a movie than a kind of grand magic trick designed to dazzle and delight and make the audience feel exceptionally clever but not to hold up to too much scrutiny. Beyond the incredible stunt casting theres a shamelessly impressive formal gimmick Most of the film has been shot to resemble a single unbroken take the great Emmanuel Lubezki (Gravity Children Of Men) masking cuts under cover of backstage darkness. This creates a sense of perpetual urgency and for all the potshots it takes at Hollywoods superhero obsession Birdman has the crowd-pleasing instincts of a studio blockbuster.Keatons ""character"" Riggan Thomson is mounting a Broadway show a Raymond Carver adaptation hes written directed and will star in--mostly as everyone speculates to prove that hes not a talentless has-been. The film takes place over a few weeks in and around New Yorks famous St. James Theatre as Riggan attempts to assuage the worries of a harried assistant (Zach Galifianakis) make nice with his resentful daughter (Emma Stone) and not completely embarrass himself on stage. Instead of jumping around in time as he did with 21 Grams and Babel Inarritu condenses it his ersatz long-take making a fortnight feel like one endless opening night. Its not the only bend in reality When not putting out fires Riggan carries on contentious conversations with his masked alter ego; usually invisible the taunting companion sounds more like Christian Bales gravel-voiced Dark Knight than Keatons whispery caped crusader.Much of the cast seems to have been hired at least partially for the echoes their involvement creates. Naomi Watts for example plays a radiant aspiring star; the Mulholland Drive connection is plain even before she locks lips with a raven-haired costar (Andrea Riseborough)--and imagining what David Lynch could have done with the material does no favors to Birdman. But beyond the intentional baggage brought aboard nearly everyone on-screen is spectacular none more so than Edward Norton. Cast as a famously difficult Method performer the famously difficult Method performer channels all of his asshole reputation into this demanding egotistical figure the worst of Riggans many problems. Hes an extraordinary prick but also unknowable Nortons scenes with Stone on the balcony of the theater reveal new dimensions to the character as though he were reborn in her presence.Speaking of rebirth Inarritu relocates an energy and passion--a sheer verve--thats been missing from his work since Amores Perros. Perpetually gliding through the labyrinthine innards of the theater often to a Punch-Drunk Love beat of percussive anxiety he captures the hustle and bustle of the backstage world--the electricity in the air when a live performance is imminent. There are a few shades of Babelish self-importance The scene where Riggan cuts down the spiteful disingenuous methodology of an icy theater critic (Lindsay Duncan the films very own Anton Ego) swells with righteous defensiveness. But couldnt the mans critique predicated on her use of references as a crutch be applied to the movie itself which name-drops everyone from Roland Barthes to Justin Bieber? Thats the type of hypocrisy that Birdman seems to intentionally indulge deflecting criticism by embracing its contradictions.But is Riggans play any good? Does the actor have hidden reservoirs of talent or is he the hack his detractors assume him to be? The film never deigns to decide on such matters probably because its more interested in process than product Whats going on in the artists mind and bleeding its way into his real world is more important to Inarritu and his three cowriters. As for the war between stage and screen Birdman calls something of a draw. The epic steadicam take(s) mimic the way theater operates with the actors becoming immersed to a degree unobtainable through a standard shot/reverse-shot filming strategy. At the same time Inarritu and Lubezki create moments--like a late literal flight of fancy--that only cinema can accomplish. For all the winks and nods and inside-baseball irony Birdman gets airborne only when its celebrating instead of skewering its heros twin vocations. In those moments the film is a gift to its audience too.

Richard Corliss Aug. 27 2014 SHARE Alison Rosa--Fox Searchlight Michael Keaton and Edward Norton in Birdman. Michael Keaton has superhero issues in director Alejandro G. Inarritus impressive technical accomplishment Riggin Thomson (Michael Keaton) who long ago played the movie superhero Birdman but now is struggling to be taken seriously as a New York stage actor listens to the old comic-book voice in his head and miraculously takes flight on a Broadway side street. ""There you go motherf--er"" the Birdman voice growls triumphantly. ""Gravity doesnt apply to you."" It does apply a little to Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) the odd and oddly punctuated title of Alejandro G. Inarritus new comedy-fantasy that opens the 2014 Venice Film Festival tonight. Last years Venice opener was Gravity directed and co-written by Inarritus Mexican amigo Alfonso Cuaron and photographed by Emmanuel Lubezki in sumptuous long takes including the astounding 13-minute first shot. The director and his cinematographer both earned Oscars for their work but the challenge they set for themselves was almost childs play compared with the game that Inarritu and Lubezki play here to make virtually the whole movie look as if it were realized in one two-hour take. Gravity upped its degree of difficulty with a cast of two (make that one). Birdman which takes place in the week or so leading up to the opening of Riggins Broadway debut in an adaptation of Raymond Carvers story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" has seven major characters running and snarling through the caverns of the St. James Theatre Riggin and his costars Lesley (Naomi Watts) Laura (Andrea Riseborough) and Mike (Edward Norton) plus Riggins daughter Sam (Emma Stone) ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan) and manager Jake (Zach Galifianakis). An eighth the corrosive Times critic Tabitha (Lindsay Duncan) waits for opening night to pounce on Riggin and write a review that would kill his play because its success would underline Hollywoods dark power over immaculate endangered Broadway. In his first bloom when he was known as Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu the director collaborated with screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga on three features --Amores Perros 21 Grams and Babel -- that wove a dozen or more fates interlocking across a city or around the world. In Birdman  written by Inarritu the Argentinians Nicolas Giacobone and Armando Bo and New York playwright Alexander Dinelaris Jr. all the characters are cramped together inside the St. James or wandering a block or two outside united by space but separated by their individual needs. As theater creates an impromptu family of brilliant invalids Birdman brings that theatrical unity to movies which usually have 600 to 1000 shots. No question that Birdman is a breathtaking technical achievement not a stunt. Shot in 30 days after a long rehearsal period with the actors and the cameras movements calibrated to the inch and the millisecond so the action flows smoothly the picture has the jagged energy of a long guerrilla raid choreographed by Bob Fosse. In Gravity Cuaron worked wonders with a solitary Sandra Bullock and the green screen behind her. Birdman has the aspect of naturalism scenes lasting 10 minutes or more (edited together with invisible transitions) demand that a couple dozen performers and technicians all be in perfect synch. Its a precision ballet whose most impressive effect is that it plays out like real theatrical life. That life echoes other backstage dramas. The rivalry of Riggin and Mike suggests a mans-world All About Eve. Charlie Kaufmans insanely ambitious Synecdoche New York investigated the same notion that the agony of putting on a show can seem like a military siege or a fatal sickness. For the movie versions of the creative and personal pressures from actors producers and ex-wives that lead their directors to the brink of suicide look no further than Federico Fellinis 8-1/2 and Fosses All That Jazz. (Albert Wolsky who created the costumes for All That Jazz is on board here; he designed everything but the scaly superb Birdman costume which was the work of Mike Elizalde.) And like any clever inside-showbiz satire Birdman exploits its stars biographies. A quarter-century ago Keaton segued from the title role of the demon in Tim Burtons Beetlejuice to the caped crusader in Burtons two Batman movies before leaving the Caped Crusader for a somewhat diminished career as a character actor. Norton making the most of his gaudy role as a crazy-great stage actor may dismiss popularity as ""the slutty little cousin of prestige"" but he did a turn as Marvels Incredible Hulk; and Stone is fresh off two installments of The Amazing Spider-Man. Riggin has a nightmare in which hes on a flight with George Clooney (a later Batman as well as Bullocks Gravity costar) and after the plane crashes the headlines mention only Clooney. Riggins nagging Birdman alter ego also dismisses the Iron Man work of Robert Downey Jr. saying ""That clown doesnt have half your talent and hes making a fortune in that Tin Man outfit."" That attitude could be Riggins sour grapes -- the snobbery-envy of serious actors who arent in superhero movies toward the serious actors who are. But it fits with his decades-behind-the-curve view of all things digital. His neglected daughter Sam just out of rehab and helping Riggin with the show tells him ""You hate bloggers youre scared of Twitter you dont even have a Facebook page. You Dont Exist."" In Birdmans skewed comic vision Riggin can succeed only by outlandish public embarrassment a walk through Times Square clad only in his underpants which gets him 300000 social-media views in an hour or a more explosive accident onstage. Through Riggins eyes the movie sees journalists as parasites either pompous (quoting Roland Barthes) or gossipy (asking the actor to comment on an online report that he uses baby pig semen as a youthening agent). He agrees with Flauberts comment that ""A man becomes a critic when he cannot be an artist as a man becomes an informant when he cannot be a soldier."" His biases are justified when the Times critic warns him shell be showing up on opening night to eviscerate the production. (Flash Theater critics see plays a day or more before the official premiere so their reviews can appear on opening night. And they would be fired if their bosses learned they had threatened an actor with a pan especially before seeing his play.) When not focusing on Riggin Birdman admits for some cogent backstage alliances and dalliances. Nortons Mike can come to erotic life only when on stage much to the chagrin of his girlfriend Wattss Lesley. (""You cant get it up for six months and now you want to f-- me in front of 800 strangers?"") Later he plays a sexy round of Truth or Dare with Sam on the roof of the St. James. Lesley also gets a brief bond when Laura suddenly kisses her. ""What are you doing?"" she asks and Laura shrugs ""Nothing."" Lesley says ""Do it again."" The movie is full of little nothings that can add up to something special. That something starts with Keaton. Now 62 his face crisscrossed with lifelines the actor uses the weariness of age more than his manic Beetlejuice energy. His Riggin playing a Carver character that he calls ""a deranged deformed version of myself"" (even as Riggin is of Keaton) seems ready to sag into defeat not ascend into madness. Yet the stars performance is the compass that guides all the actors who must play off him in their fiendishly compressed and extended moments. Birdman represents not just Keatons fictional apologia but also his defiant nearly heroic comeback. Finally the Gravity comparison is unfair. The Cuaron film launched audiences into a stratosphere of emotions; Birdman is grounded by everyday worries. Its a comedy after all -- one that takes its ex-heros career and personal anxieties and makes them fly high. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

""Clouds of Sils Maria"" which had an aging Juliette Binoche keeping ambitious acolytes at bay recently hit the festival circuit. So did David Cronenbergs California Gothic ""Maps to the Stars"" with Julianne Moore as an insecure basket case. And now comes ""Birdman"" an even more fantastic tale with Michael Keaton playing Riggan Thomson a former star -- he played the winged superhero of the title -- now trying to make a decades-late comeback and take on Broadway. Yes Keaton who was once a blockbuster Batman. Keaton whose most recent movie jobs have been voicing cartoons or doing quick guest shots in comedies and action pictures. Art imitates life and all that. Get it out of your system. Because ""Birdman"" is far wilder and weirder than that. Directed and co-written by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (who also made the challenging and sometimes maddening jigsaw puzzles ""21 Grams"" and ""Babel"") ""Birdman"" is a movie that starts with a shot of Thomson in his dressing room. In his underwear. Levitating. Thomson it seems -- or at least it seems to him -- still has the superpowers he had on screen. He also still has Birdmans voice in his head -- an insistent gravelly voice constantly telling him where hes gone wrong (and trying to lure him back for a sequel). But Thomson wants prestige -- so badly that he has adapted and is directing and starring in his own adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" It is probably a bad idea -- and gets worse when he casts a pompous actor as his co-star. Birdman may have once flown among the skyscrapers. But its a fair bet that Thomson and his play are soon going to fall to earth. Michael Keaton left and Edward Norton square off in BirdmanALISON ROSA/FOX SEARCHLIGHT In the past Inarritu has been a master of the fractured narrative -- organizing stories thematically rather than temporally starting in the middle skipping to the end then going to another middle. It was eyecatching but Id think frustrating to an actor -- even though he attracted great ones like Sean Penn you never got to watch their performances build. Here though Inarritus done the opposite structuring the film not only in a strictly linear fashion but in what looks like (its not but its cleverly done) a single take. The camera never stops moving never cuts away and so were on top of everybody in the cast as they rush on and off rehearsal stages into bars out in the alley for a smoke. Its a very smart device because it immediately creates the real-life tension right before a theatrical opening; the camera like the characters seems constantly out of breath. Once again too Inarritu has collected a fine cast including Edward Norton (having a grand old time playing the egotistical thespian) Emma Stone (all saucer eyes and jittery nerve endings as Thomsons freshly rehabbed daughter) the great Amy Ryan as his ex-wife and a just-subdued enough Zach Galifianakis as his lawyer. (That Norton and Stone are also both veterans of superhero films -- a genre referenced mockingly more than once here -- only adds to the knowing satirical jabs.) But this is truly Keatons film and not just because of the obvious (if probably superficial) parallels. Hes always been comic or dramatic an intense actor with a mobile face but age has dried and cracked those rubbery features; he looks weathered now weary and worn out. He looks like hed like to quit. But he also looks like he could he needs to muster the energy for one last big run at it. So we cheer him on even as the play begins to fall apart. We root for him even as his own grasp of reality gets more tenuous. We want Thomson and Keaton to soar -- and this time without the superhero costume. With its magic realism (or maybe just straight-out hallucinations) ""Birdman"" is an unashamedly trippy film that doesnt mind slipping the bonds of logic. Thats why it falls a bit to earth itself whenever it grows obvious whether its through its Icarus allusions or monologues (Keaton tells off a critic Stone lambastes Keaton) that seem far more about giving an actor a juicy scene then something rooted in reality. But even those false steps (and a pace which begins to bog down toward the end) ""Birdman"" is still a daring startling piece of work. And not only for what Inarritu manages to show. But for what Keaton is courageous enough to reveal. Ratings note The film contains strong language substance abuse sexual situations and brief violence. Birdman (R) Fox Searchlight (119 min.)

"Birdman starring Michael Keaton reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Amazing Michael Keaton Is Only the Second-Best Thing About Birdman The Amazing Michael Keaton Is Only the Second-Best Thing About Birdman Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Oct. 16 2014 1056 AM Birdman Or the Not-Unexpected Virtues of Michael Keaton and Emmanuel Lubezki. By Dana Stevens Michael Keaton as Riggan in Birdman. Courtesy of Fox Searchlight After youve seen Birdman come back and listen to Slates Dana Stevens David Haglund and Forrest Wickman discuss the movie in our Spoiler Special. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus pitch-dark backstage comedy Birdman opens on an arresting image a man in a dressing room seated in the lotus position in his underwear appearing to hover in midair. Is this a magic being capable of defying the laws of gravity? A regular earthbound man dreaming of flight? Or something in between the two--an illusionist? An actor? The camera too hovers for a long moment behind the mans back giving us time to wonder what kind of world weve been dropped into--then pulls back from this floating figure to investigate his shabby dressing room before eventually zipping off down the narrow theater corridors into the wings and onto the stage. Its the beginning of a movie that while ultimately less satisfying than I hoped features two breathtaking star turns one from its lead actor and another from that camera wielded by the indisputably magical Emmanuel Lubezki. Youve seen Lubezkis bold and technically innovative work in Gravity and The Tree of Life. In Birdman his camera bounds through the movies confined spaces like a curious animal poking its nose wherever it wishes following whomever it likes. Though it wouldnt be accurate to say Birdman was filmed in a single long take--there are several moments when characters pass through a darkened space in order to mask visible cuts the digital-age equivalent of the reel changes in Rope--Inarritu and Lubezki go to great lengths to make sure the film feels to the viewer like one continuous shot. The necessary feats of timing and blocking on the parts of both cast and crew are spectacularly well conceived and executed even if youre not always sure how the illusion serves this specific story. But that roving camera is reliably one of the most intelligent and vibrant presences onscreen. Movies dont have to be perfect to make for exciting viewing and Birdman demands to be seen on the big screen. Advertisement Thats saying something in a movie that contains a lead performance from Michael Keaton. Keaton whose dervishlike energy and sly wit made him one of the revelations of 1980s screen comedy turned down a 15 million offer to make a third Batman movie about 20 years ago and more or less retired to a quiet life on a Montana ranch. (Hes appeared in a few movies here and there and does some voice work.) In interviews he comes off as an essentially happy thoughtful and well-balanced person with neither resentment toward nor nostalgia for show business. That description could not be made of Riggan Thomson the unwillingly retired ex-superhero-actor Keaton plays in Birdman. (Full title by the way per press materials BIRDMAN or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance which cmon.) Keaton has said the part of Riggan wasnt written specifically for him. If thats true its one inspired piece of casting. What we know of the actors own history as an abdicator of the superhero throne gives this role a depth beyond its somewhat thin conception on the page--which is not to discount Keatons phenomenal performance as the embittered showbiz has-been he could have been in another life. But like the play Riggan Thomson is about to preview on Broadway--a stage adaptation of a Raymond Carver story written directed by and starring Riggan himself--Birdmans aesthetic and intellectual ambitions outstrip its actual ideas. For all its brilliant aspects--Emmanuel Lubezkis restless camera and Michael Keatons restless face not to mention Naomi Watts Ed Norton and Emma Stone giving razor-sharp comic performances--Birdman makes you gasp at its formal audacity even as you sigh at its thematic overfamiliarity. Its a high-wire act strung over a void. As Riggans Broadway show goes into previews hes in desperate straits. An injured actor has been replaced at the last minute by Mike Shiner (Norton) a grandstanding thespian whose obsession with onstage ""honesty"" extends to breaking the fourth wall to chew out an unappreciative audience. Shiner is sleeping with the plays leading lady Lesley (Watts) whos a mess of nerves about her long-awaited Broadway debut. The shows producer Jake (Zach Galifianakis) keeps appearing in Riggans dressing room to update him on theater-world rumors of the plays imminent collapse--and of course to remind him that theyre almost out--seriously completely out--of money. Advertisement MeanwhileRiggans daughter Sam (Stone) fresh out of rehab has begun working as her fathers assistant but she cant bring herself to forgive him for years of lackluster self-obsessed parenting. She skulks through the theater in her dads wake mocking him for his vanity and evident neediness tearing his ego down as fast as he can build it back up. Birdman continues to incorporate elements of magical realism after that first levitation scene. In an ongoing conceit Riggan is visited in his dressing room by his superhero-suited alter ego (voiced by Keaton) a forbidding yet faintly comical figure clad in shimmering black feathers and a beaked mask. Birdman is at once Riggans inner critic and his inner enabler able to describe in detail all his creators worst character flaws and then shamelessly exploit them. But this split between the actor and the monstrously successful myth hes created--which could have made for one of the richest relationships in the movie not to mention a great acting challenge for Keaton--never transcends the status of a contrivance. We intermittently glimpse Birdman perched on the arm of a chair (or in one case on a toilet). On and off we hear his disembodied voice (impossibly low like Keatons Batman rumble passed through an electronic gravelizer) as he cruelly torments Riggan with references to his past glory then plies him with whatever empty puffery he needs to hear. But we never get a sense of what playing this character once meant to Riggan much less learn anything about the iconography or fandom of the scowling winged superhero. For a movie that both stars and tells the story of a former cape-wearer Birdman seems notably uninterested in exploring the comic-book movie as a form even if only to satirize or critique it. As the (highly ambiguous) ending approaches the identities of the actor and his avian creation sometimes seems to be merging back into one again--a sign either that Riggan has finally stopped regretting and second-guessing his past or that hes finally gone completely off his rocker. But movies dont have to be perfect to make for exciting viewing and this one in particular with its dazzling formal presentation demands to be seen on the big screen. (In fact watching it feels at times not unlike a ride--a description that was leveled as a criticism at Alfonso Cuarons [and Lubezkis] Gravity last year--but that seems less contemptuous when applied to a film with this much deliberately antic energy.) Keaton rises to the formidable challenge of underacting as an actor who overacts. Norton has one of his funniest roles in years as Mike a self-serious ham whos impotent offstage but priapic the minute the curtain rises. And Galifianakis gets a rare chance to play a straight-man role his earthy presence providing a backdrop for the Keaton characters frequent bouts of hysteria. The female performers get short shrift in comparison to the male ones especially Andrea Riseborough who plays Riggans possibly pregnant mistress in a role so underdeveloped you begin to wonder if shes a figment of his imagination. Late in the film as Riggans seemingly doomed opening night approaches he stumbles into a liquor store to buy a bottle of booze as a homeless man (or is it an auditioning actor?) stands on the street bellowing the famous ""tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow"" speech from Macbeth ""Lifes but a walking shadow a poor player/ Who struts and frets his hour upon the stage ... "" Birdman does its own share of strutting and fretting during its two hours on the screen The camera struts while the dialogue frets. Theres also plenty of sound and fury including a hard-edged percussion score from the drummer Antonio Sanchez. This is no tale told by an idiot--on the contrary its a funny fast-moving parable about fame and ambition laid out for us with care and craft by a gifted filmmaker a long-missed actor and a world-class cinematographer. But Im left with the suspicion the whole thing may signify--well if not nothing at least a good deal less than the filmmakers would have us believe. Correction Oct. 20 2014 This article originally misstated that 21/2 decades had passed since Michael Keaton turned down a 15 million offer to appear in Batman Forever. Keaton refused the role in late 1993 or 1994 making the elapsed time closer to 20 years. (Return.) Update Oct. 16 2014 This review has been updated to reflect that the costumed Birdman is voiced by Michael Keaton but portrayed by an uncredited Benjamin Kanes. (Return.) Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1. Hillary May Have Won the Convention War but She Did Not Win the Ratings War 2.

We go to the movies to make the connection between lives lived off and on screen all the time. Its what turned up the heat between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie in Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith and allowed us to buy Mickey Rourke as a punch-drunk cautionary tale in The Wrestler. To deny that would be dishonest. Keaton was of course the star of Tim Burtons first two Batman films in the late 80s and early 90s before he walked away from the series. It remains a decision we cant help but wonder if he has regretted. Is that fair? Probably not. But its through that same blurry prism that we watch him take flight in Alejandro G. Inarritus twisted and surreal dark comedy. And its what turns a clever movie into a poignant one. Keaton now 63 with a vanishing hairline and a murder of crows-feet framing his still-rascally eyes plays Riggan Thomson the onetime box office megastar of the blockbuster Birdman films. After the third installment in the fictional franchise he gave up the cowl (and the wealth and fame that came with it). All these years later he misses and craves the adulation -- something that the mocking sinister Birdman voice in his head keeps reminding him of. As the movie opens Riggan has staked the remainder of his savings -- and perhaps whats left of his sanity -- on a last-ditch attempt to put himself back on the publics fickle radar. Hes writing directing and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carvers ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" an appropriately highbrow choice of material that lets us in on both Riggans seriousness of purpose and lack of subtlety. Birdman kicks off as a dizzy backstage farce. Still in previews Riggans play is shaping up to be a colossal disaster. He may or may not have gotten his leading lady (Andrea Riseborough) pregnant his estranged daughter (Emma Stone) has signed on as his personal assistant and is a constant reminder of what a bad father he was and his newest cast member (an excellent Edward Norton) is a self-serious loose cannon whos sleeping with his insecure costar (Naomi Watts). Inarritu the Mexican director of puzzle-piece melodramas such as Babel and 21 Grams has a lighter looser tone here taking aim at the needy egos of theater folk and the craven carpetbagger mentality of Broadway today where movie stars without stage training are leveraged to sell tickets. Goosing the satire to life is daredevil cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men) whose camera bobs and weaves amid the chaos in what looks like one long breathless Steadicam shot. As opening night approaches and the pressure on Riggan mounts the taunting voice in his head grows louder until its unclear whats real and whats imaginary. The film breaks with reality too jackknifing into a trippy detour that audiences will either go with or not. For me there was never any question. I was so all-in on Keatons vanity-free go-for-broke metamorphosis I would have followed him or the movie anywhere. Which is pretty much where it asks you to go. Birdman is a scalpel-sharp dissection of Hollywood Broadway and fame in the 21st century. But more than that its a testament to Keatons enduring charisma and power as an actor. He soars.

Dramatic comedy about a former superstar staging his Broadway debut. Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (159). R Language sexuality violence. Angelika. Everyone loves a comeback story. And director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (""Babel"") has given Michael Keaton a beauty. So dont be surprised when the guy you still think of as Beetlejuice -- or is it Batman? -- is everywhere the next few months. ""Birdman (or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" offers us a double rebirth really with a resurgent Keaton playing Riggan Thomson a washed-up actor who once played an iconic superhero but has barely been heard from in years. Sound familiar? Riggan is staging his own comeback as the director and star of an upcoming Broadway drama. Everything about the project an adaptation of a Raymond Carver story suggests disaster. Riggans co-leading man (Edward Norton) is a brilliant lunatic. The leading ladies (Naomi Watts Andrea Riseborough) are in emotional turmoil. Riggans producer (Zach Galifianakis) is neurotic Riggans ex-wife (Amy Ryan) is embittered and his daughter (Emma Stone) resentful. As for Riggan himself he alternates wildly between delirious egomania and crushing insecurity. The movies most compelling scenes suggest he may not have the firmest grasp on reality. Defiantly embracing his own risks Gonzalez Inarritu shoots his backstage farce in what appears to be one long fluid take. His camera is perpetually on the move. Acclaimed cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki (""Gravity"") stalks Riggan through narrow theater hallways and into a packed Times Square streets. Antonio Sanchezs percussive score follows Riggan as well an insistent reminder of the pressure hes under. The films unusual structure is a great asset but does trip up the less experienced actors. Stone and Galifianakis appear intermittently uncomfortable even as Keaton and Norton embrace the challenge to terrific effect. Michael Keaton Naomi Watts and Zach Galifianakis in Birdman (fox searchlight) There are other shaky moments as Inarritu takes sharp but overplayed aim at among other things celebrity egos brainless fandom Hollywood anti-culture and (ahem) petty newspaper critics. The emotionally earnest finale too undermines the movies otherwise daring edge. But its undeniably thrilling to watch Gonzalez Inarritu and Keaton aiming so high. Whenever theyre brave enough to leap into the unknown ""Birdman"" soars. eweitzmannydailynews.com Tags movies movie reviews birdman birdman or the unexpected virtue of ignorance alejandro gonzalez inarritu michael keaton edward norton naomi watts andrea riseborough zach galifianakis amy ryan emma stone Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

An unrecognizable Michael Keaton seems to have aged 40 years since the last time he appeared on the screen but hes still the best (i.e. only) reason to suffer through a miserable load of deranged deluded crap masquerading as a black comedy called Birdman. BIRDMAN  (1/4 stars) Written by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris and Armanda Bo Directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Starring Michael Keaton Zach Galifianakis and Edward Norton Running time 119 min. Mr. Keaton once played Batman so maybe hes perfect for the role of Riggan Thomson an actor whose career in idiotic action movies about Birdman a flying comic book superhero who wears ill-fitting Halloween costumes has tanked. Humiliated and desperate to be taken seriously he turns down Birdman 4 moves to New York and tries to redeem himself by mounting a Broadway play with his own money. The play hes adapted is Raymond Carvers What We Talk About When We Talk About Love which hes also directed and starring in with another Hollywood star seeking respectability (Naomi Watts who is making more movies these days than James Franco and not always the right ones). His comeback is sabotaged by roadblocks from the get-go but the night before the first preview his male co-star drops out after being knocked unconscious by a mysterious flying object and another demented Hollywood refugee from the set of Bates Motel (Edward Norton in the most embarrassing role of his checkered career) takes over the role. This manipulative maniacs stardom is good for the box office but disastrous for the play which is suddenly being lodged in hell by a lunatic quartet from the Hills of Beverly. Enter Riggans daughter Sam fresh from drug rehab (Emma Stone) his off-again on-again lover Laura (Andrea Riseborough who once played the Duchess of Windsor directed by Madonna so as a smart judge of movie properties she rests my case for me) and his ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan). To make the skin crawl Zach Galifianakis is also on hand as his frenzied lawyer-producer. Never have I seen a group of actors who look more collectively like theyve dropped into the middle of the Mojave Desert in the middle of August wearing nothing but their underwear. Losing whats left of his reason Riggan consults the voice of his movie alter ego Birdman who instructs vases to move at will and objects to smash into an actors head. Mr. Nortons character wrecks the first preview by guzzling gin onstage instead of water and doesnt even know what play hes in (""Can we not get hung up on learning lines?"" he sniffs). His girlfriend announces shes pregnant and his daughter deflates his ego further by blaming his downfall on his resistance to Facebook and Twitter (the only intelligent thing in his favor if you ask me). The night before opening in the middle of the final press preview Mr. Keaton gets locked outside the theater before the last act half-naked and is forced to jog through Times Square in his Jockey shorts. Its supposed to be a comedy but Birdman is directed by the usually brilliant Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu (Babel) who knows nothing about the subject. The result is a train wreck without a shred of continuity a hashtag that doesnt even get the geography right. The action takes place inside a real Broadway theater the St. James which is a musical house on West 44th St. But when they leave the stage door the actors are next door to the Edison Hotel which is actually on 47th St. Its a mess unstructured and throwing itself all over the place in one hysterical scene after the next. The silliest character of all is an evil dill pickle of a critic (Lindsay Duncan) from The New York Times (at least they cant blame this one on Ben Brantley) who destroys plays without even seeing them composing her venom in a bar down the street. Mr. Keaton wears himself out trying to bring home the truth that a goose can never be a peacock but everything else eludes me. Some of the critics who embrace this kind of stupidity claim that Birdman pretends to say something witty about the perils of celebrity fame stardom success and failure not necessarily in that order but I can find nothing good to say about any shard of the pretentiousness on view here. In the end Mr. Keaton gives up completely and levitates. Then he dons his Birdman suit and flies through the canyons above the traffic and over the bridges and rivers of Manhattan. At last we know the only way where being Birdman pays off. You dont have to head for JFK to get out of town. You can fly back to Hollywood all by yourself.

Since then Christian Bales somber strutting and muttering as seen in Christopher Nolans Batman movies has -- go figure -- become the gold standard of Batman performances. But theres no vitality in Bales brooding; hes dark in the way wet coffee grounds are. Keaton played Batman as a hero who save for a somber twist of fate might have been mischievous and joyful and confident -- he wanted to be all of those things and just couldnt. Instead of stumbling around in his own self-pitying darkness he kept turning in futility toward the light. His suffering had the keen metallic edge of a migraine. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - In Birdman directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu Keaton pours all of Batmans simmering disquietude into a different form that of Riggan Thomson a has-been actor who hopes to reclaim his reputation by staging an ambitious Broadway show an adaptation -- one hes written himself -- of Raymond Carvers ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" Things arent going so well. The play is about to go into previews and Riggan knows that one of his actors is a dud -- a replacement Edward Nortons Mike Shiner steps in and while hes dazzling he also gives Riggans authority a kick in the pants. Meanwhile the shows producer (Zach Galifianakis) frets with a great deal of justification that hes about to lose his shirt. Riggans two actresses Naomi Wattss Lesley and Andrea Riseboroughs Laura flounce about radiating moonbeams of actressy insecurity. His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) has just been sprung from rehab and spends her days being bitchy at the world and at him.Those are all problems that Riggan perceives and addresses in some fashion but there are even bigger ones that he doesnt The movie character that made him famous a superhero costumed in a breastplate of molded feathers and a beaked mask -- the Birdman of the title -- has been taunting him in a shadowy monotone that actually sounds like Bales Batman pestering Riggan to admit that his theater project not to mention his whole life is a sham. This beastly winged Marleys Ghost urges Riggan to accept that he is Birdman and will never be anything more.Film Details Birdman RatingR GenreComedy Running Time119 More Info Have I mentioned that this psychically distressing apparition may also have vested Riggan with the power to move objects Carrie-like with his mind? Theres a lot going on in Birdman though the somewhat harsh truth is that Riggans agitation and torment are really just an excuse for the pyrotechnics of the filmmaking. Its novelty It was shot (by cinematographer extraordinaire Emmanuel Lubezki) as one continuous sequence. In other words the film appears to consist of a single long take though Inarritu and Lubezki have done some subtle piecing-together. Not that youre likely to notice the seams and not that you should go looking for them Part of the fun is giving in to the illusion allowing yourself to float and swoop with the camera through backstage corridors onto outdoor balconies lit with that faux-daytime Broadway glow and even on a mad dash along a block of Times Square.The script -- by Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo -- doesnt go as deep as it purports to Like so many stories about existential crises Birdman suffers from a kind of generic listlessness. And it whacks a little too obviously at some of its targets -- the noisy emptiness of blockbusters and the obnoxious supremacy of social media for example. But Birdman has humor on its side -- its mischievously darkly funny as when Nortons hotshot loose-cannon scene-stealer literally destroys a stage set after launching into a ""None of this is real"" tirade. Just as his tantrum reaches its climax he throws open the door of a badly assembled kitchen cupboard and the whole thing dishes and all comes crashing to the floor. Its an exhilarating bit of slapstick madness. Stone is wonderful too Shes like a Dickensian waif with serrated edges.Its a relief to see Keaton in a role worthy of him. As it turns out the insecurity of aging actors figures in a number of about-to-be-released movies In Barry Levinsons The Humbling based on Philip Roths novel Al Pacino plays a floundering actor who tries to restore his mojo by kindling an ill-advised romance with a young academic (Greta Gerwig). That movie isnt as technically dazzling as Birdman but maybe its the lack of fancy packaging -- plus Pacinos eternally woebegone eyes -- that makes it more piercing. And in Olivier Assayass upcoming Clouds of Sils Maria Juliette Binoche plays an actress whos haunted by a character she played 20 years earlier. The aging-performer motif takes on a different texture when were talking about a woman who feels less desirable -- or simply feels less and less of something -- with each passing year.Birdman is a marvelously entertaining picture a work of ""look at me"" bravado thats energized every minute. Its proficiency the mechanically fluid kind works against it in some ways. But none of that diminishes what Keaton does. His Riggan is like a grizzled nerve ending frayed and whiskery but alive. Now and then when we stop to take a breath and look into Keatons eyes we can see all the ecstatic anguish there as if the comedy and tragedy masks had been morphed into one. No wonder hes the darkest knight.2 Courtesy of Fox Searchlight Pictures Ellen Page Kidnaps an Infant in Tallulah but She Means Well NEXT Contact Stephanie Zacharek Follow szacharek Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Entertainment ""Birdman"" Will Make You Fall Back In Love With Movies Michael Keaton makes a thrilling comeback in Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritus movie about acting fame and the hilarious messiness of life. Its one of the years best. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Michael Keaton hovers about West 44th Street in Birdman. Fox Searchlight ID 4022224 The first time we see Riggan (Michael Keaton) the conflicted soul at the center of Birdman hes meditating. In his undies. His bared torso is that of a perfectly normal middle-aged man which is to say a little soft and comical in those tighty-whiteys and not the sort thats typically brandished in a Hollywood movie. Its not a big deal to most people but meaningful to Riggan (""I look like a turkey with leukemia"" he howls when looking at himself in the mirror) a fading star who once acted in a superhero franchise about a masked avian-themed vigilante named ""Birdman."" No longer a desired blockbuster lead and anxious to prove himself a serious talent Riggan is directing and starring in a Broadway play that he wrote himself adapted from Raymond Carvers What We Talk About When We Talk About Love. Riggan is also levitating in midair in that scene a bit of yogic flight thats the first of many signs of superpowers he displays over the course of Birdman abilities that the movie realizes in gorgeous fullness while giving us understated but solid reasons to believe theyre all in his head. Its a splashy way to show us Riggans growing delusional side as well as his ego -- what A-lister former or otherwise believes himself bound by something as mundane as gravity? ID 4022214 Fox Searchlight Fox Searchlight ID 4022204 Birdman which opens in New York and L.A. on Oct. 17 and in more markets the weeks after sets out to dazzle and by god does it. Its the fifth film from Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu whose career kicked off with the triptych Amores Perros and continued along a path that while earning him two Academy Award nominations became so gruelingly grim by his last film 2010s Biutiful that it approached arthouse self-parody. Birdman -- which Inarritu wrote with Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo -- feels as broadly ambitious as Babel his most widely watched work to date but without the crushing burden of self-importance. It flies as free as Riggan in that early moment hovering over the Earth before its chaos drags him back down. Its focused on a play but Birdman might as well be a film about filmmaking and about creation in general in all its messy terrifying vulnerable glory. As he goes into previews Riggan is juggling a new co-star (Edward Norton) whos talented but way too ""method"" for his own good a daughter (Emma Stone) fresh out of rehab whos working as his reluctant assistant an ex-wife (Amy Ryan) a girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) an increasingly uneasy producer/bestie (Zach Galifianakis) an insecure leading lady (Naomi Watts) a vicious theater critic (Lindsay Duncan) and Birdman himself a manifestation of Riggans fears and vanity who talks to him in a low growl. Hes broke hes frightened and hes set on a journey from which he cant back out. The cinematography by the great Emmanuel Lubezki (who won an Oscar last year for his work on Gravity) has been devised so that the movie looks like one long seamless take following characters through the warren of hallways and back rooms at the St. James Theatre and out onto the stage or the crowded Times Square street. Its a marvel of technical achievement that along with the jazzy drum score by Antonio Sanchez gives the film the unstoppable momentum of a downhill skier whos committed to reaching the bottom of the mountain whether its on his face or still standing. ID 4019151 Fox Searchlight Alison Rosa/Fox Searchlight ID 4022437 Rather than joining scenes the usual way with cuts Birdman refuses to blink fluidly switching its rapt gaze between characters observing a tete-a-tete between leading ladies Lesley (Watts) and Laura (Riseborough) before theyre interrupted by the unpredictable Mike (Norton) Lesleys current or maybe former lover who it then follows up the stairs to the roof for a chance meeting with Sam (Stone). Theres enough teeming activity going on that it never sags. And into this nonstop action it folds its touches of magical realism which build with Riggans instability until hes summoning explosions with a snap of his fingers and taking flight above an indifferent city. Riggan may be teetering on the edge of a breakdown but the film never loses its sense of humor or playfulness. Its a brilliant portrait of actors in all their dysfunction self-regard fragility and capability never more so than with Mike who arrives blows the roof off an impromptu rehearsal with Riggan then immediately destroys the preview performance by insisting he drink real gin during a scene for the sake of authenticity. ""Why dont I have any self-respect?"" Lesley bemoans of her relationship to him. ""Youre an actress honey"" Laura answers without losing a beat. Riggan may not have that excuse. ""Youre no actor youre a celebrity"" sneers Tabitha (Duncan) the New York Times theater critic (and as the lone character to be left out of the movies bubble of empathy its only real sour note). Shes spotted his weak point one his daughter Sam also prods out in a moment of frustration -- Riggan has retreated to the stage and to a play based on a beloved story by an acclaimed author about real people having real dramas because these are things that announce his artistic relevance. But he has no idea if hell pull it off and Birdman cycles through some hilarious variations on theatrical disaster including a panic dream come to life thats too good to spoil. ID 4022581 Fox Searchlight Fox Searchlight ID 4022944 Birdman fizzles along exuberantly but it also has a precisely layered structure thats in no way accidental. Mentions of Icarus echo the winged superhero Riggan became famous for playing. Keaton himself whos indeed terrific in the role had his own stint in a cape and cowl several decades earlier and his Birdman role is the very career rejuvenating moment his character is trying to create for himself. The movie dives into questions of art and fame and the connection between the two and whether the best art demands destruction but it also punctures its own grandiosity before it can ever get out of control. When a character stands on the edge of a roof as if poised to jump for instance a woman yells with no great concern ""Hey is this for real or are you shooting a film?"" Like a sprawling Robert Altman ensemble film or Federico Fellinis 81/2 with which it could be shelved in some holdout video store some day Birdmans bursting with too much life to be constrained by its themes. It feels big in a way that has nothing to do with fantastical armies in array or giant explosions and thats enough to make you fall back in love with the movies all over again.

The movie centers on the fevered exertions of Riggan Thomson a fading movie star played by Michael Keaton (he made his fortune like Keaton in the role of a superhero) to prove himself on Broadway in a self-penned self-directed adaptation of Raymond Carvers ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."" The camera hurtles after Riggan from his dressing room to the stage (often hes chased by his harried producer played by Zach Galifianakis) and back to his dressing room with glimpses on the way of among others a whiny actress (Naomi Watts) her hot-dog actor boyfriend (Edward Norton) and Riggans mouthy fresh-from-rehab daughter (Emma Stone). In between his clashes with actors Riggan is taunted by the voice of his old character Birdman who reminds him of his sorry state and how much more deserving he is than the rest of the wretched showbiz world. How the superheroic have fallen Related Stories The Real Comeback of the Fake Michael Keaton Scenes From the Birdman Set Birdman is the very definition of a tour de force and Inarritus overheated technique meshes perfectly with the (enjoyable) overacting -- the performers know this is a theatrical exercise and obviously relish the chance to Do It Big. But what comes out of the characters mouths is not so fresh. In the course of the films two hours we learn that Riggan wasnt there for his daughter growing up that he was lousy to his wife (Amy Ryan) that he has an actress girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough) to whom he cant make the ultimate commitment. Mostly Riggan marinates in self-pity -- for all his energy hes a tiresome character. I had to remind myself that good as Keaton is he has been so much freer and more fearless onscreen. Though he got rich as Batman he made his mark as a clown; his Beetlejuice the bio-exorcist remains one of the modern screens most rollicking comic creations. The somber Birdman persona doesnt connect with anything in Riggans or Keatons personality; its just a pretentious literary conceit. How much different this movie would be if Riggan were visited by Beetlejuice -- a reminder of what Keaton was once and could be again. We root for Riggan -- how could we not? -- but Inarritu never bothers to tell us if his Carver adaptation deserves to succeed if its good. The snippets we see are stilted and obvious though the sheeplike audience is shown marveling. (Inarritu doesnt seem to have much respect for the medium of theater.) The films low point is a scene with a smugly corrupt New York Times chief drama critic (Lindsay Duncan) who pens her reviews in a Theater District bar and tells Riggan that sight unseen shell destroy his show because hes a movie star -- as if critics werent (along with everyone else) delighted to see film actors test themselves onstage and fill the houses. (Inarritu should hardly complain about critics most of whom were wowed by the pretend depths of 21 Grams and Babel.) The films bright spot is Norton whose matinee idol exists on a level of jerky entitlement thats positively mythic. Hes a gleeful exhibitionist and Lord of Misrule -- Beetlejuice as a Method actor. Birdman is the sort of film that wins standing ovations from audiences and theyre not unwarranted. How can you not be in awe of the sheer physical achievement of the intricate choreography of the actors and the camera of the gung ho performances? When it ends you go ""Whew"" Its a triumph of vacuous virtuosity.A A A A A A A This article appears in the October 6 2014 issue of New York Magazine.

By Anthony Lane Michael Keaton stars in a new film directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu.   Credit Illustration by Peter Strain Do not go to ""Birdman"" to relax. It stars Michael Keaton who has always behaved onscreen as if he knew that there was a raging mosquito bite somewhere on his person but could not quite locate it. His performance in ""Beetlejuice"" (1988) was halfway between a rush and a rash and what drove his Bruce Wayne to fight crime in ""Batman"" (1989) was not so much civic outrage as a rich mans anxiety and ennui; at supper with Kim Basinger he confessed that he had never been in his own dining-room before and in ""Batman Returns"" (1992) he spat out vichyssoise as if it were chilled hemlock. The Bat-Mantle has rested uneasily on Keatons shoulders ever since and something similar weighs upon his character Riggan Thomson in ""Birdman."" Twenty years ago Riggan too played a superhero with a movie franchise to himself. He was Birdman he could fly destroy his foes with a magic whoosh and use his telekinetic skills to move random objects at will. And look at Riggan now. He can barely summon the energy to remove his own wig. His career path has followed that of Icarus and in a bid to avoid splashdown and to restore his credentials Riggan has chosen to direct and star in a play adapted by himself from a Raymond Carver tale on Broadway. Many folk like the Times theatre critic Tabitha Dickinson (Lindsay Duncan) presume that he is heading for a fall and he certainly surrounds himself with plunging of every sort. His daughter Sam (Emma Stone) who is fresh out of rehab and helping with the production can often be found on the theatre roof perched on a perilous ledge. At rehearsal a member of the cast is felled by a tumbling arc light. A replacement is needed fast and as Riggans long-suffering friend Jake (Zach Galifianakis) explains the choice is narrow Woody Harrelson is doing another ""Hunger Games"" Michael Fassbender is on ""X-Men"" duty and Robert Downey Jr. is soldered tight to ""Iron Man."" Luckily Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) another big name is free. The lurking joke here is that although Mike derides Hollywood for its ""cultural genocide"" Norton himself played the Incredible Hulk in 2008. What ""Birdman"" squawks at though is not just the comic-book cravings that have convulsed the movie industry of late but the more enduring follies of the dramatic profession as it brims with special pleading and quivers at the thought of sagging fame. In one pitiful scene Riggan reminds his ex-wife that ""Farrah Fawcett died on exactly the same day as Michael Jackson"" the implication being that he too will be open to total eclipse. As for Mike Shiner the savior of the hour he soon fulfills the criteria of a dickhead remarking to Sam as she shows him around that ""your ass is great."" Later by way of Method-based veracity he quaffs gin rather than water onstage and proposes replacing a fake pistol with a real one. You can guess how well that turns out. Yet ""Birdman"" is not primarily a satire. The director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu doesnt tell us what to mock--or at any rate he knows how readily we mock what tempts us most. His film is alive to needs that never die. Even as Riggan wrestles with failure something of Birdman sings within him. We find him levitating cross-legged in midair and in fury or frustration he can still cause things to zip across the room. This is a beautiful conceit of a kind that neither Spider-Man nor Thor would dare to countenance the idea of superpowers that linger in the impotent spirit like sudden surges of youth in the middle-aged. At one point Riggan strolls down the street clicking his fingers to make cars explode and balls of flame sizzle from the heavens. There is even a giant black griffin that clings to a skyscraper and screeches down at city life--music to our heros weary ears. You could of course treat this as the merest update on Walter Mitty or as a remembrance of roles past. Riggan is not actually setting New York on fire. But heres the thing ""Birdman"" all two hours of it unrolls--or appears to unroll--in a single take with sequences spliced together so cunningly that we cannot see the joins. This has been tried before notably by Alexander Sokurov in ""Russian Ark"" (2002) where the seamlessness became a parade of a countrys history. Inarritus ambitions are less sweeping but more intense. Thanks to his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki we cannot tell precisely where Riggans daily grouches end and where his imagination starts to take wing. It tends to be cued on the soundtrack by sudden shameless bursts of Tchaikovskys Fifth Rachmaninoffs Second and Mahlers Ninth--all of them absurdly mismatched with the pettifogging wants of our hero. And yet as Riggan soars along the avenues in a shabby old raincoat you do get a kick as you would from a decent blockbuster. It is deep in the nature of moviegoing as Inarritu knows to be wowed by weightlessness and raised aloft by the promise of escape. His previous films like ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams"" slipped down the crack between the anguished and the po-faced. ""Birdman"" though twenty times funnier is a more serious work refusing to stint on the high human comedy of forever falling short. If Mike is such a noble talent why does he insist on his own sun bed at the theatre and then wearing only his underpants get into a childish fight with Riggan? How does Riggan not to be outbriefed wind up in his underpants marching through the throng of Times Square with a defiant strut? And whats the answer to the vicious spiel that Sam rattles off at her father pointing out that to jack up his C.V. by putting on a play of all things based on a story by some dead white guy will hardly rescue him from oblivion in the eyes--and on the phones--of her generation? ""Birdman"" is not without its flaws. Someone could have told Inarritu that critics though often mean are not preemptively so and that anybody who said as Tabitha does ""Im going to destroy your play"" before actually seeing it would not stay long in the job. Also some viewers hustled and bustled by the action may find it all too much. Should I need a fix of backstage shenanigans I will still return to ""All About Eve"" a more feline and less exhausting affair. But Sam for one would sneer at such backwardness and ""Birdman"" right now is on the money. In Riggan and the rest of the cast writhing with the dread of being a nobody but appalled by what it takes to be a somebody we see not just the acting bug but also the New York bug the love bug and if were honest the life bug diagnosed as what they are a seventy-year itch. When ""Birdman"" is not cranking up the symphonies it relies on a brisk percussive score by Antonio Sanchez. Thats a great match for the film but next to the aural assault of ""Whiplash"" its barely more than a muffled thud. ""Whiplash"" written and directed by Damien Chazelle is insane; or rather its about driving yourself to the crumbling brink of insanity and to hell with everyone else. Andrew (Miles Teller) studies drumming at music school in New York. The first thing we see him do in the film and the last is drum. In between he gets a girlfriend (Melissa Benoist) but drops her because he cant both love and drum; hes in a car crash en route to a performance but still gets there in time to drum; and he earns a spot as the principal drummer in the schools top jazz band run by Fletcher (J. K. Simmons) who treats his students like drums--thin-skinned objects to be struck again and again until they make the sound that he wants. Thanks to ""Whiplash"" Simmons will lend comfort to those actors who believe that if they wait long enough the right role--their role--will come along. Fletcher is such a part. He is clad in black like a gravedigger. He likes to cut off the band after a couple of bars not with a swipe of the hand but with a shudder of his clenched fist. He thinks nothing of telling a student to show up at six in the morning although rehearsal starts at nine. And God preserve you if youre off the note or dragging behind the beat. To a pupil struggling not to cry Fletcher says ""Are you one of those single-tear people?"" and later ""You fucking weepy-willow shit sack."" Let us pray that somebody runs that clip at the Oscars when Simmons is up for Best Supporting Actor. Whether ""Whiplash"" tells us much about music despite a fine rendition of Duke Ellingtons ""Caravan"" Im not sure. Its more about power than it is about jazz and the fetishistic closeups--of blood and flying sweat as well as of tears--suggest a blend of boot camp football coaching and pornography. At the climax a grimacing Andrew plays an unstoppable solo which sends you out on a high but also leaves you with a long echo of loneliness and you wonder if in the hunt for excellence he will ever be happy again. Fletcher sworn enemy of the merely O.K. knows the deal ""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job "" he says. Morally thats a disgrace; artistically it is simple common sense; socially its dynamite and ""Whiplash"" could become the first film to be picketed by the soccer moms of America.

""Birdman"" stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thompson a once-upon-a-one-time box office megastar for playing the caped-and-cowled superhero of the title in three huge loud hits. Years later Riggan is throwing his fortune and sanity into his Broadway debut a play based on the works of Raymond Carver where hes writing acting and directing. Any similarity between Thompsons resume and Keatons is purely intentional. The backstage farce as depicted here is a noble tradition stretching back to ""Kiss Me Kate"" and ""Noises Off."" Riggan feeling small even as the pictures got bigger is a clear nod to ""Sunset Boulevard."" Inside the toxic bubble of celebrity culture Inarritu is also using Riggans rise and fall and attempted resurrection as commentary on a society more obsessed with good cheekbones than good work an age that wont endure never mind enjoy any artwork longer than a Vine clip or more complex than a Tumblr GIF. In the chaos leading up to opening night as Riggan scrambles to make the previews go even vaguely well Inarritu has his camera glide bump and cut through events in one continuous cinemagically unbroken shot as Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography creates Riggans world and Antonio Sanchezs drum-based score bumps bangs and bursts out of the speakers. The easy joke is that while many are touting ""Birdman"" for Best Picture its undoubtedly the front-runner for Most Picture. The cameraworks sinuous movements become forced and then tedious not serving the story in any way but instead functioning as a ""Look at Me"" attention-getting device designed to make you notice directorial genius more than it is to help you follow the characters. The score is loud atonal and offered as an all-you-can-eat affair when a small taste or two would have been sufficient. Riggans inner conflicts are shown through special-effects sequences that add nothing beyond proving Inarritu can juggle yet another ball. This is not a film in need of creativity passion or energy; what it needed was restraint consideration and direction. This is not saying that ""Birdman"" is awful or a debacle; there are superb scenes here as well as excellent performance moments but they get drowned out in the flood of Inarritus ambition energy and fantasies. With its mentions of and nods to method acting Marvel Movies ""Mulholland Drive"" ""Macbeth"" and Malibu ""Birdman"" is explicitly designed for people who love show-business as much as they worry about it. But all the cultural cues -- up to and including the ha-ha snigger of ex-Batman Keaton as the ex-Birdman -- dont add up to anything and at times ""Birdman"" feels like a filmed version of a bad New Yorker Cartoon one where the viewers smile doesnt come from any punchline but from the satisfaction they feel at understanding the reference. Keaton is excellent here as he always is even when the direction and script (by Inarritu Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo a too-many-cooks affair smeary with the fingerprints of many hands) arent satisfied with just his talents and squirm about him frantically like over-eager puppies. Zach Galifianakis gives what may be his finest work as Riggans lawyer finally playing a character with spine and strength. Edward Norton is also a highlight as a theater actor whos a God on the boards in front of an audience and a mess everywhere else. Naomi Watts Emma Stone Amy Ryan and Andrea Riseborough are all good with Stones work as Riggans post-rehab daughter making her first among equals of all the supporting actresses. Thematically the film is dedicated to the obvious -- time moves on while we arent looking show business can be awful and venal and glorious wanting is the root of all suffering big studio blockbusters can be bad -- and its final notes which present human tragedy and death as some kind of metaphorical victory lap are utterly tone-deaf and pseudo-spiritual. ""Birdman"" overwhelms you by design and with vigor but when the shouting and steadi-cam shots are over theres both far too much and not nearly enough left behind.

Starring Michael Keaton as an aging actor attempting to reclaim his flagging celebrity (sound familiar?) Inarritus screenplay and restless formalism at once convey aspects of real life and depart from them in dramatic fashion. Predominantly shot in a simulated long-take set at the Broadway theater where Keatons character attempts to stage a new play ""Birdman"" creates the illusion that it takes place in real time. But with its relentless pace and bizarre circumstances it hovers in an off-kilter state leaving open the suggestion that the entire thing may take place within its protagonists head. Considering that hes got a lot on his mind ""Birdman"" is a sensory overload that exists in a class by itself. No Rules Inarritus camera first captures his desperate anti-hero Riggan Thomson (Keaton) floating in a lotus pose in his underpants. Alone in his dressing room the poster of the titular superhero that gave him his fame lurking nearby Riggan is instantly positioned in a world where anything can happen. Whether he actually possesses psychic abilities or has already gone nuts remains an open question that the movie doesnt pause long for us to ponder Zipping onstage to rehearse an adaptation of Raymond Carvers ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" Riggan faces the challenge of finding a new cast member when one of the other leads is abruptly incapacitated. Then were back to watching Riggan in his dressing room moving objects around with his mind and suddenly the gimmick makes sense Its a natural embellishment on his desire to control everything around him even as his universe threatens to collapse. Over the course of the next two hours Riggan attempts to find a new creative outlet in Carvers text even as the greater dramas of his real-life -- a possibly pregnant co-star (Andrea Risborough) and a drug-addled daughter (Emma Stone) chief among them -- loom more prominently. The disconnect from a single focused text is a uniquely modern concept and one that threatens to overwhelm Riggan at every turn. ""This isnt the nineties anymore"" someone tells him. ""Birdman"" makes this point in countless innovative ways though one particularly noteworthy bit finds his daughter brandishing a smartphone in front of her father and displaying a viral video while announcing ""This is power."" In essence civilization has developed beyond his comprehension no matter how hard he tries to grab hold of it. Inarritu explores the surreal nature of Riggans environment with ceaseless motion. As he did with ""Gravity"" cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki forges new ground with his seamless use of Steadicam which frequently performs the impossible The camera wanders from backstage to the city streets and glides to impossible heights in a ballet of constant movement. Days pass by and the story covers a lot of ground but Riggans universe never sits still. The Extremes of Performance Keaton -- wrinkled greying and bubbling with passion at every turn -- rises to the challenge with fascinating determination on par with his character. The role feels heavy and veers dangerously close to becoming heavy-handed but it also acknowledges that very challenge. Riggan meets his match when he casts obnoxious egomaniac Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) in the play regularly coping with the actors freewheeling willingness to screw things up onstage at every moment. Norton in his most enjoyably high-spirited turn since ""Fight Club"" relishes the opportunity to play the smarmy foe to Keatons scowling demeanor. A battle between the two men as Keaton whips Norton with a rolled-up New York Times featuring coverage of the play oscillates between silly and energizing in one fell swoop. It might be the best physical achievement in both of their careers. But Nortons wily temperament is matched by Stone as Riggans cynical daughter who delivers a darker role than anything suggested in her earlier roles. Even Zach Galifianakis as Riggans hyperactive producer and best friend manages to each beyond his goofy standards with a zany performance closer in form to Jeremy Pivens fast-talking agent on ""Entourage."" A Worthy Target Like that show ""Birdman"" puts the entertainment industry in its crosshairs but takes a more incisive trigger-happy approach gleefully thumbing its nose at mainstream American cinema. Within the opening minutes Inarritus script name-drops Michael Fassbender Woody Harrelson and Jeremy Renner in the context of superhero franchise mania; later Keaton glares in the mirror as the gruff voice of the costumed avenger he played decades earlier intones ""Were the real thing. We handed these posers the keys to the kingdom."" His ex-wife assails him for ""that ridiculous comedy you did with Goldie Hawn."" His daughter puts it bluntly ""You arent doing this for the sake of art."" A steely-eyed critic at the local watering hole (Lindsay Duncan) says hes ""a celebrity not an actor."" At every turn Riggan is trapped by industrial forces that have moved on without him. While the number of cheeky references to real-life actors and events pile up to an extreme degree the exaggerated feel fits this canny satire which is firmly rooted in the present. In a frantic monologue Riggans daughter assails her dads old-school sensibilities ""You dont even have a Facebook page"" she exclaims. ""Its like you dont exist."" The looming threat of social media forms a compelling juxtaposition with the free-flowing camerawork Riggan fights to keep track of his life even as everything around him grows increasingly fragmented. With so much spirited dialogue and self-referential qualities ""Birdman"" often reeks of overly fancy screenwriting trickery. During one particularly vicious showdown with the critic committed to taking him down -- a role that Duncan plays with demonic enthusiasm -- Riggan offers a searing riposte to bad reviews (""Youre just labeling everything""); its not hard to imagine Inarritu wrote the bit for his own sneaky shot at catharsis. But the scene works like many others due to the impression that were several steps removed from the reality of Riggans experiences. As the actor battles to uncover artistic integrity the movie functions as a commentary on its own melodramatic excesses. Theres meta and then theres ""Birdman"" which takes meta to a new level. A Better Direction For All ""Birdman"" is especially gratifying in contrast to the humorless mopey dramas that Inarritu has made in the past -- ""Biutiful"" ""Babel"" ""21 Grams"" -- suffer from overwrought gravitas practically begging audiences to experience the emotions they offer up. ""Birdman"" assails that very notion In a cynical age why bother to feel anything? And as a response it offers the rawest performance in Keatons career and puts the last few decades of his projects in a bracing new context. As Birdman whispers in Riggans ear the lure of the commercial realm takes on a demonic presence that eventually erupts in startling CGI mayhem during the closing act. Whether or not Keaton himself experiences the temptations of the blockbuster arena in similar fashion ""Birdman"" suggests the conundrum stems from deep-seated anxieties. Inarritu underscores Riggans paranoid state with a jazzy drum solo sometimes even revealing the drummer in unexpected places which strengthens the likelihood that anything can happen. Moment to moment ""Birdman"" manages to shift gears its roaming camera revealing new surprises as it glides along. That degree of unpredictability provides it with the ultimate response to the sea of formulaic mediocrities at the center of its critique. Above all else ""Birdman"" derives its allure from the tension between fluid camerawork and invented moments. In an age defined by virtual connectivity and splintered communication the mystery of how to obtain meaningful experiences is greater than ever. ""Is this for real or are you filming me?"" Riggan says at one point. The degree of uncertainty in that question is the foundation of the movies unique appeal. Grade A- ""Birdman"" opened the Venice Film Festival and screened over the weekend in Telluride. It screens next month at the New York Film Festival and opens nationwide on October 17.

(For instance Riggan does not say that line at the end of this piece. He is asked a question by an onlooker. Riggans answer is an ironic lie in the context of the movie. And the response from the onlooker is an even more ironic truth.) Reply Warren Spencer May 12 2016 1106 am Like the look of this.

Inarritus blistering showbiz satire. A quarter-century after ""Batman"" ushered in the era of Hollywood mega-tentpoles -- hollow comicbook pictures manufactured to enthrall teens and hustle merch -- a penitent Michael Keaton returns with the comeback of the century ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" a blisteringly hot-blooded defiantly anti-formulaic look at a has-been movie stars attempts to resuscitate his career by mounting a vanity project on Broadway. In a year overloaded with self-aware showbiz satires Alejandro G. Inarritus fifth and best feature provides the delirious coup de grace -- a triumph on every creative level from casting to execution that will electrify the industry captivate arthouse and megaplex crowds alike send awards pundits into orbit and give fresh wings to Keatons career. SEE ALSO Michael Keaton Bursts Into Oscar Race Keaton was a controversial choice to play the Caped Crusader back in 1989 though the role was the best and worst thing that could have happened to the ""Mr. Mom"" star who became world-renowned but never found another role of that stature -- and who didnt get nearly the same boost from working with Tarantino (on ""Jackie Brown"") that John Travolta and Bruce Willis did (from ""Pulp Fiction""). As Riggan Thomson Keaton isnt playing himself so much as an archetype that few other actors could have fit an insecure celebrity whose Faustian decision to embody a superhero called Birdman subsequently made it impossible for critics or audiences to take him seriously in anything else. Riggan is one of those roles like Norma Desmond in ""Sunset Blvd."" that relies heavily on the actors offscreen persona and it works because audiences know so little about Keatons private life though they find him endearing even when hes playing narcissistic characters. Its hardly the first time the movies have cannibalized themselves for subject matter and yet Riggans dilemma seems larger than that of one actor. His crisis is somehow universal possibly even cosmic as suggested by the apocalyptic sight of a dying star flaming comet-like across the screen at the outset of the picture. Cut to Riggan levitating calmly in his dressing room the day before previews begin for his big play. It will be more than half an hour before the next obvious splice -- a trick that d.p. Emmanuel Lubezki learned on ""Children of Men"" and here he extends the illusion of long uninterrupted takes for nearly the duration of the entire feature as the behind-the-scenes tension escalates through to opening night. For his Broadway debut Riggan has selected Raymond Carvers ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" adapting the short story in such a way as to give himself all the glory from the bathetic monologue that comes just before intermission to the ballistic finale (invented for the play) which sees his character blowing his brains out moments before the curtain falls. This is a movie-star approach to theater where truly great stage actors let their co-stars shine. But then Riggan has something to prove surrounding himself with pros -- including a respected old friend (Naomi Watts) and the much younger actress he happens to be shagging (Andrea Riseborough) -- in hopes that they make him look better. And when an accident allows Riggan to replace a weak player with someone better Mike (Edward Norton) he leaps at the chance clearly unprepared for what sharing the spotlight with a real actor entails. If agreeing to play Birdman represented some sort of artistic sellout earlier in Riggans career (a compromise compounded when he agreed to make two sequels) then this Carver play ought to earn back his cred. Or so he figures surrounding himself with a yes-man producer (Zach Galifianakis in masterfully subtle control of his comedic impulses except for one moment where he inexplicably mispronounces ""Martin Scorsees"") and other sycophants. Riggan has even gone so far as to convince himself that he has telekinetic powers using his mind to move objects and taking advice from the disembodied voice of Birdman (Keatons own lowered a register). But his druggie daughter/assistant Sam (Emma Stone) calls his bluff eviscerating his irrelevance in a rant sure to win over a generation too young to have seen Tim Burtons ""Batman."" This is perhaps one of the unexpected virtues of ignorance referred to by the films evocative full title Riggan approaches the Carver play without all the baggage of a traditional Broadway actor but then theatergoers approach it with different expectations as well ranging from the spiteful prejudgment of a jaded New York Times critic (Lindsay Duncan trying to seem her Meryl Streepiest) to the naivete of youth. (Oh to pluck out Sams eyes and see Broadway through them) The film virtually overflows with references to contemporary blips such as Justin Bieber and established minds like Roland Barthes managing to be simultaneously crude and urbane while speaking to different audiences on whatever intellectual level they prefer. As for intent Inarritu and co-writers Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris Jr. Armando Bo are clearly taking a generational stand with this script which mourns a time when Hollywood actors had the chance to play flawed and fascinating men as opposed to one-dimensional supermen. Like last years ""The Great Beauty"" ""Birdman"" finds itself parsing a deep creative and existential crisis never allowing its justifiable cynicism to drown out what idealism remains even as it observes that our finest screen actors -- Michael Fassbender Robert Downey Jr. and Jeremy Renner among them -- are all cashing comicbook paychecks these days (even as it conveniently pretends that Nortons ""Hulk"" never happened). Norton very nearly steals the show from Keaton at one point. Revealing body and soul alike both stars are inviting us to laugh at aspects of their real selves though Norton initially seems the more impressive actor amplifying his own intense commitment to realism to absurd extremes -- with the hilarious result that finding himself in the moment during an early performance proves a rather dramatic cure for his characters offstage impotence. At first Keaton doesnt seem capable of reaching as deep either in reality or as Riggan though thats before the humiliation of wandering through Times Square crowds nearly naked. ""Birdman"" offers by far the most fascinating meta-deconstruction of an actors ego since ""Being John Malkovich"" and one that leaves no room for vanity. From the moment Keaton first removes his wig to the sight of him wrapped in Batman-like facial bandages his performance reveals itself in layers. The role demands that he appear superficial and stiff onstage while behaving anything but as the characters personal troubles mount and his priorities begin to align -- at which point he appears in a dual role donning the ridiculous Birdman costume to hover seen only by Riggan like a cracked-out version of Broadways own ""Harvey."" Judged by Howard Hawks quality standard -- ""three great scenes no bad ones"" -- ""Birdman"" features at least a dozen of the years most electrifying onscreen moments (scrambled so as to avoid spoilers) the levitation the hallucination the accident the fitting the daughter the critic the ex-wife the erection the kiss the shot the end and Times Square. Most films would be lucky to have one scene as indelible as any of these and frankly its a thrill to see Inarritu back from whatever dark dreary place begat ""21 Grams"" ""Babel"" and ""Biutiful"" three phony contrived melodramas engineered to manipulate while posing as gritty commentaries on the harsh world we inhabit. With ""Birdman"" the director has broken from his rut of relying on shaky handheld camerawork to suggest ""realism"" or an invasive Gustavo Santaolalla score to force the desired reactions instead finding fresh ways to delve into the human condition. (He has even altered his onscreen credit condensing ""Gonzalez"" to a mere ""G."" as if to acknowledge this new chapter.) Yes the film is preoccupied with an aging actors psyche but it also addresses fatherhood marriage personal integrity and the enduring question of the legacy we leave behind -- as in an amusing scene in which Riggan imagines being upstaged by ""Batman and Robin"" star George Clooney in his obituary. Above all it is an extremely clever adaptation of Carvers short story simultaneously postmodern (ironically a rather retro label) in its meta self-parody and cutting-edge owing to the dynamism of its style. Circling shark-like around Keaton then darting off to stalk other actors Lubezkis camera is alert and engaged at all times an active participant in the nervous backstage drama. Taking a cue from Alfred Hitchcocks ""Rope"" the meticulously blocked shoot cleverly finds ways to mask cuts using invisible visual effects to stitch together various scenes so it appears that the entire film is one continuous take even though the events take place over several weeks and in various midtown Gotham locations -- primarily Broadways St. James Theater but venturing out anywhere that Riggan can walk or Birdman can fly. In addition to being a virtuoso stunt in its own right this single-shot illusion serves to address the critique that screen acting is somehow less demanding than stage acting since there are no conventional editing tricks in place to shape the performances. The cast has no choice but to ante up which everyone does in spades and the film is built generously enough that everyone gets ample time to impress (although it should be noted that none of the background sexual intrigues amount to anything). Inarritus approach is mind-boggling in its complexity nearly as demanding on Lubezki as ""Gravity"" must have been such that even seemingly minor jokes as when the camera spies the drummer responsible for the pics restless jazz score (by Antonio Sanchez) lurking on the edge of the frame had to be perfectly timed. Its all one big magic trick one designed to remind how much actors give to their art even as it disguises the layers of work that go into it.

OOH SEXY LAYDEEZ CUM FLUFF ME UP yawn Reply Thom says January 25 2015 at 348 am Its a reference to Naomi Watts character in Mulholland Dr. She played a wannabe actress who arrived in Hollywood not that different from her Birdman character where she hoped to make it big in Broadway. She was involved in an erotic lesbian relationship in Mulholland Dr as well so the parallels are there. Reply Cat says November 22 2014 at 215 pm Great review Didnt ""get"" all of the films subtler messages especially in the end but loved the acting and uniqueness of script and soundtrack. Ed Norton stood out immensely in this film ... his performance was brilliant. Its definitely worth seeing. Reply Daryle says November 21 2014 at 738 am To me if there was a really stunning performance here it was Nortons. Thats not to say everyone wasnt good because they were but Norton stands out. Frankly though I think this a movie actors might love - as it seems pretty self-indulgent - but its doubtful that general audiences will be as thrilled with it. At the end of it I felt like ""So what?"" It really didnt move me one way or another and what was the point of it all? I cant say I liked any of these characters either. Finally several reviewers have seen the ""on-and-off-drumming"" as something positive/appropriate in this film. I just found it annoying. But given the utter incomprehensibility of the Oscar musical score voting group it wouldnt shock me if they give this film an Oscar for its score. Reply James M. says September 10 2014 at 104 pm ""...trying to seem her Meryl Streepiest."" Well thats condescending. Reply feingarten says August 27 2014 at 313 pm With all this attendant fuss re  Birdman the reviewer has left me with the impression that the vehicle was designed to specifically allow Keaton to demonstrate his acting prowess in an attempt to legitimatize his career missteps if one were to look upon them that way. Or simply put his life can infuse his art. To have a character stage his comeback by doing theater is an age old concept. There is nothing unique about such an endeavor and here it is a contrived plot point. While he indeed maybe Oscar worthy to call out those 3 actors seems like you Sir are damning them with faint praise as it were. Each of the 3 cited have engaged in other cinematic activities Do you not remember Fassbender in Shame/12 Years a Slave or the satiric performance of Downey in Tropic Thunder? Or would there have been the overblown American Hustle without the quiet affecting performance of Bale/Adam/sCoopers object of desire Jeremy Renner? Reply Anita says August 28 2014 at 1057 am The reviewer didnt call them out the movie called them out. Reply feingarten says August 28 2014 at 1144 am thanks Anita- why the writers chose to single these 3 out is a bit unfair. Yet it only further serves to substantiate my point- this is a vehicle for Keatons comeback. After all how did he come to the forefront- by portraying a superhero whom many feel is still the best Batman on film? Bek says August 27 2014 at 350 am Anything with Sir Robery D Jr is guaranteed to succeed So says my mind anyway xox love your work Reply Cai Cathail says August 27 2014 at 1140 am What an excellent review. One of the best Ive read in a great long time. Thoroughly researched and genuine in its praise. Well done. VERY much looking forward to this one. Ive missed Michael Keaton.

Daily Edition Login to download Birdman Venice Review 200 AM PDT 8/27/2014 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Birdman lives TWITTER Michael Keaton soars in Alejandro G. Inarritus brilliantly directed dark comedy about celebrity and creation Birdman flies very very high. Intense emotional currents and the jagged feelings of volatile actors are turned loose to raucous dramatic and darkly comedic effect in one of the most sustained examples of visually fluid tour de force cinema anyones ever seen all in the service of a story that examines the changing nature of celebrity and the popular regard for fame over creative achievement. An exemplary cast led by Michael Keaton in the highly self-referential title role of a former superhero-film star in desperate need of a legitimizing comeback fully meets the considerable demands placed upon it by director Alejandro G. Inarritu as he now signs his name. The films exhilarating originality black comedy and tone that is at once empathetic and acidic will surely strike a strong chord with audiences looking for something fresh that will take them somewhere they havent been before. Dating back to his international breakthrough with Amores Perros 14 years ago Inarritus films have always coursed with energy and challenges embraced. Here he and his indispensable cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki have gone the extra mile to make a film that like a far more complicated and sophisticated version of what Alfred Hitchcock did in Rope in 1948 tries to create the illusion of having been filmed all in one take. Birdman which bears the rather enigmatic subtitle ""Or the Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance"" is not only centered on the world of the theater but takes place almost entirely within or very near the venerable St. James Theater on West 44th Street. This is where faded big-screen luminary Riggan Thomson (Keaton) is about to begin previews for what he hopes will bring him renewed acclaim and respectability ego boosters that have eluded him in the two decades since he decamped from the Hollywood mountaintop upon saying no to Birdman 4. Of course Riggan knows hes fated to always be Birdman; he still keeps a poster from the franchise on his dressing room wall and the characters voice sometimes squawks at him like a challenging alter ego. But hes now put everything on the line including his own money to mount a stage adaptation of Raymond Carvers What We Talk About When We Talk About Love which hes written is directing and is co-starring in with Lesley (Naomi Watts) another film star making her Broadway debut and Laura (Andrea Riseborough) a sometime lover whos more keen on him than vice versa. When the other male actor in the piece startlingly becomes incapacitated Lesleys boyfriend Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) a major film name immediately volunteers to step into the breach. This is a godsend for the box office but a wild card in terms of the quartets dynamics as the quicksilver Mike is a fiendish manipulator (quite the jerk actually). After unsettling Riggan at his first rehearsal by having already memorized his part and then demanding rewrites Mike detonates the initial public preview by drinking real gin (this is Carver country after all) instead of water onstage. More raw nerves are supplied by Riggans straight-from-rehab daughter Sam (Emma Stone) whom Dad has perhaps misguidedly engaged as his personal assistant. Riggan has to listen to Sams tirades about how his resistance to Twitter and blogging make him even more of a has-been than he was already this on top of Lauras news that shes pregnant and his concerns over what outrage Mike might provoke at the second preview. There are enough awkward predicaments secret liaisons theatrical pranks opened and closed doors and offenses given and taken in Birdman to fill a Feydeau farce. But while Inarritu who wrote the script with his Biutiful co-screenwriter Nicolas Giacobone playwright Alexander Dinelaris and The Last Elvis director and co-writer Armando Bo certainly triggers any number of dark and even catch-in-your-throat laughs hes out for bigger game here on several fronts. Riggans struggle to regain self-respect and a sense of accomplishment is an ambition attacked as sheerest vanity by Sam and Mike who enjoy provoking him further by pursuing a little dalliance. Beyond this central subject the film takes vivid X-rays of such matters as creative egos and insecurities spontaneity versus careful planning what one does or does not do with power and influence the positives and negatives of fame and the contrast between the public impact of a controlled event like a theater performance and an impromptu happening such as Riggans sprint through a jammed Times Square wearing nothing but his underpants (dont ask). Propelled by outbursts of virtuoso jazz drumming by Antonio Sanchez the storys action spans several days but plays out in a visual continuum of time unbroken -- until the very end -- by any evident cuts; its as if the already legendary opening 13-minute take in Gravity had persisted through the entire movie. Its no coincidence that the same cinematographer the incomparable Lubezki shot both films although the effect here is very different; as lucid and controlled as the camerawork may be its also bold propulsive even raw at times and invariably in the right place at the right time to catch the actors as they dart in and out get in each others faces or ponder the effect of what theyve just said or done to someone else. The scene transitions are handled with breathtaking seamlessness and once you realize whats going on and stop watching for signs of cuts as the camera goes through a door or enters a dark space you get into the groove of a film whose rhythms are entirely controlled by the movement of the performers in relation to that of the camera -- without the subtle visual disruption that even the most graceful cut must make. If there is a problem from a dramaturgical point of view its that the roles of the plays other actors to some extent Mike but more so Laura and Lesley recede instead of deepen as opening night approaches. And one scene which feels more like score settling than anything real simply doesnt ring true In a theater district bar Riggan runs into the formidable Tabitha (a withering Lindsay Duncan) the all-powerful drama critic for the towns (once) all-powerful leading newspaper. When he quietly offers her a drink she tells the man to his face that hes an unwelcome Hollywood interloper on her turf and promises that even though she hasnt seen it yet ""Im going to kill your play."" Vendettas of this sort might have been pursued on occasion in the old days but for a critic to announce her intentions like this directly to the artist seems all but impossible even ridiculous today; the victim would likely call the papers arts editor at once. An actor who himself has waited a very long time and perhaps with diminishing hope to make a comeback Keaton soars perhaps higher than ever as a thespian with something to prove when not wearing a funny suit. Casting any sense of vanity out the window -- every vestige of aging skin and thinning hair is revealed by the camera -- the actor catches Riggans ambition and discouragement and everything in between; hes criticized and beaten down even and perhaps especially by those closest to him although he does receive some reassurance and understanding from an unexpected source his ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan). Keaton skillfully conveys how this old bird can let even the most alarming setbacks just slide off his once-feathered back to get on with the show one his whole future rides upon -- unless of course it doesnt. Norton is crackerjack as the bad boy actor whose gigantic ego does constant battle with equally large insecurities while Stone stands out among the women particularly in two nocturnal theater rooftop scenes she shares with Norton (in one they play a nifty little session of Truth or Dare). Zach Galifianakis plays it straight as Riggans exasperated producer and attorney. Shot in 30 days almost entirely at the St. James this is a film that will excite discerning viewers but will likely electrify professionals in the popular arts primarily because its a work that seeks to go beyond the normal destinations for mainstream films -- and manages to make it to quite an exciting place.

Director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and legendary cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki (""Gravity"") have used camera and editing tricks to make the film look like one continuous take and while it sounds gimmicky the constantly moving camera and seeming lack of edits underscore the jitteriness of the proceedings from various characters desperately holding on to their fragile egos to the million catastrophes that beset those panicky final days before a Broadway opening. See video Michael Keatons Life Smells Like Balls in Full Birdman Trailer (Video) Its not a real-time movie -- we jump ahead in time during some of those camera swoops -- but the lack of edits jacks up the tension within scenes especially with Antonio Sanchezs percussive bebop soundtrack underscoring the action. Michael Keaton stars as Riggan Thompson an aging Hollywood star best known as the star of the ""Birdman"" superhero franchise. Desperate to regain the publics good graces -- Riggans compassionate ex-wife Sylvia (Amy Ryan) tells him ""You always confused being admired with being loved"" -- he has sunk his money into a stage adaptation of Raymond Carvers ""What We Talk About When We Talk About Love"" that hes starring in writing and directing. Previews have just begun and everything seems to be a shambles An actor gets hit by a falling light and has to be replaced with arrogant Broadway fave Mike Shiner (Edward Norton) whose girlfriend Lynne (Naomi Watts) is already in the cast; co-star Laura (Andrea Riseborough) tells Riggan shes pregnant and the babys his; Riggans recently-rehabbed-and-possibly-relapsing daughter Sam (Emma Stone) resents her fathers late-in-life attempts to be part of her life; and a toxic theater critic from The New York Times (Lindsay Duncan) has already decided to shut down the show sight unseen because she resents untrained interlopers from Los Angeles. (""You people give each other awards for cartoons and pornography."") Putting aside this baseless and infantile loathing of the critic class ""Birdman"" is an often intelligent and unpredictable look at actors loving their spontaneity and creativity without glossing over their emotional needs and volatility. Riggan is so consumed with self-doubt that he often hears the voice of Birdman in his head telling him to abandon this artsy-fartsy stage business so he can return to the screen for the ""apocalyptic pornography"" that global audiences crave. Inarritu shouldnt be one to throw stones emotional pornography is often his stock in trade with heavy-handed unearned-bummer message-fests like ""21 Grams"" ""Biutiful"" and ""Babel"" on his resume. ""Birdman"" sees a previously untapped sense of humor; his screenplay (written in collaboration with Nicolas Giacobone Alexander Dinelaris and Armando Bo) features a mordant sense of humor full of characters who know how to crack wise even when theyre falling apart. Also read Birdman to Open Venice Film Festival The director has wisely assembled an ensemble of performers who know how to handle a long take; this will certainly rank among Keatons career highlights -- in a role that allows him to completely dump out his paintbox and show a vast range of emotion -- but everyone shines. (Keep an eye peeled for comedy all-stars Merritt Wever and Zach Galifianakis both squeezing every drop out of their smallish roles.) While Lubezkis bravura camerawork (particularly in a segment involving Times Square a packed Broadway theater and a skivvies-clad Keaton) threatens to steal the show these actors all know how to draw focus. The films more fantastical moments courtesy of Riggans imagination -- the conversations with Birdman the actors apparent telekinetic abilities -- often border on the precious but the writers are mostly successful at circling around and making them pay off at the end. Also read Mark Ruffalo Michael Keaton Rachel McAdams in Talks to Star in Catholic Church Sex Scandal Drama (Exclusive) In an early funny scene Riggan complains that Robert Downey Jr. Michael Fassbender and Jeremy Renner all got more out of putting on a superhero costume than he ever did but ""Birdman"" serves as a potent reminder that even if Keaton was comic-book when comic books werent cool the actor still has plenty left in his utility belt.

So said Marlon Brando. But what happens when their 15 minutes are up? Its not like failure suddenly transforms former mega-celebs into humble human beings who can pick up their own coffee from Starbucks. Thats Michael Keatons problem in this savagely funny strangely sweet sad and utterly brilliant New York-set comedy from Mexican writer-director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu better known for his gloomy state-of-the world dramas Babel and 21 Grams.Keaton is Riggan Thomson an actor who raked in the cash in the early 1990s as a lame pre-Avengers superhero in a blockbuster franchise (a clear nod to Keatons own days as Batman). He hasnt made a Birdman film in years - but Birdman is still part of him. Quite literally theres a naff booming comic voice in his head (Youre the real deal) and it gives him superhuman powers. Is Birdman a figment of Riggans imagination? Is this a dig at superstar actors with inflated egos who have trouble telling the difference between real-life and their movie characters? Whatever it is Riggan has problems. Hes trying to reinvent himself for a second act as a Serious Artist remortgaging the house in Malibu to write direct and star in an adaptation of a Raymond Carver short story on Broadway. But Birdman is shitting on the plan telling Riggan to make a reality TV show instead of this piece of shit.Birdman is hilarious simply as a film about putting on a play shot by Inarritu in a jittery handheld style. Emma Stone with ripped tights and bleached hair is brutally funny as Riggans messed-up daughter fresh out of rehab. Theres something a bit Wes Anderson for grown-ups about these people. Edward Norton is a stage actor a couple of decades too old for his bad boy rock-star-of-Broadway routine who joins the troubled play at the eleventh hour. When he gets an erection on stage Stone waspishly points out its getting more Twitter reviews than the play.This isnt the super-cynical snarky piss-take of actors it might sound like. Inarritu feels for these people. Norton hitting on Stone tells her with disarming sincerity that if he could have any part of her it would be her eyes - so he could see New York again as a 20-year-old. Its an extraordinarily touching moment. Best of all Keaton is dream casting and hes fearless never holding back with the rodent-like twitchy facial tics. The films subtitle is The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance. And the brutal truth is even when hes trying to be a good dad Riggan can never get past his own ego. And that same ego (Birdman?) will also protect him from lifes slings and arrows.We know Inarritu has a dark side (just look at his previous films like Amores Perros and Babel) and its not entirely hidden here. Life is disappointing his film is saying (it opens with a Carver quote Did you get what you wanted out of life?). But its also beautiful and at times unexpected. This film does real justice to that idea its dazzling and rambling intimate and sprawling and its carried along by an infectious off-the-cuff jazz score. As soon as it ends youll be dying to fly with it again.

A tedious night at the pictures a few people left and the thought crossed my mind as this film tries too hard. It probably read well on paper but struggled onto the screen.

Yes the tracking shots are cute yes the drummer makes you smile - but it never actually shifts planes into something deeper. The dialogue at times is Hollywood (okay Theatreland) 101. Critics only write because they cant act/direct (like we havent heard that flaccid argument again and again). And theres nothing more un-ironic (okay that may not be a word) than Nortons character delivering the sounds-like-a-greeting-card line after delivering...guess what...yeah exactly. For me the first huge disappointment of 2015.

I really enjoyed this slightly bizarre film and definitely think it was Michael Keaton at his best.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreMar 30 2016O. GordonTastemakerFeaturedI was keen to see Birdman. Oscar winner tick. Received well by the critics but not so well at the box office tick (Im not one for a Hollywood Blockbuster). A film reliant on a script and characters rather than CGI and quick cuts tick. The first hour was pretty much everything I wanted from it. The dialogue is slick the chemistry is great the cinematography and direction is very well thought out and the pace never lets up. Then when you think you have a handle on the direction its heading in it becomes more introspective. I was enjoying the relationships between the key characters and the struggle to produce a hit play not so much the internal battle of the main protagonist. From here it becomes a bit vague and a bit confusing. When the visual effects started to permeate the screen I felt a pang of disappointment not that they are done badly just that they dont add much to the film. Surprised it won the Oscar but definitely worth a watch.Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreFeb 24 2016aerweiseTastemakerFeaturedThis movie is just weird and Im pretty sure I didnt get it...

It draws you into its carefully constructed world full of extraordinary characters and complex backstories and spits you back out after two absorbing hours.

Keaton is good and being a fan of the theatre I liked the set-up and the behind-the-scenes goings-on.
