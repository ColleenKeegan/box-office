The four eponymous siblings were adopted as delinquent kids by tough-talking foster mum Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan). Her time on screen is shortlived; she is gunned down in a grocery store after giving a shoplifting teen a stiff but kind-hearted lecture on social behaviour. Singleton presumably slipped in this brief pre-killing sequence to drum home the reason why her disparate sons - two black two white - have managed to stay so firmly on the straight and narrow. But now shes gone and all four Mercer brothers - irascible ex-boxer Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) womanising dude Angel (South Central rapper Tyrese Gibson) young rockstar wannabe Jack (Garrett Hedlund) and businessman Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin of eccentric pop duo OutKast) - have returned to Detroit armed with a hatful of questions and revenge on their minds.  A quarter way through the film switches from a likeable character-led study on family ties - that sees the boys revisiting their home for the funeral and exchanging enjoyably mundane reminiscences around the Thanksgiving table - to a slice of visceral urban warfare with caricature baddies big guns and loud bangs. Credit to Singleton; he rarely loses sight of the human drama side of things bathing it all in an urban silvery hue and garnishing it with a stimulating soundtrack. A shame then that the films dogged by too many anomalies and loose ends and in the end by a lack of tension. Some select turns though especially from Benjamin who sports a set of teeth like a row of luxury hotels on the Florida coast.

"Vengeful Brothers in Arms washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Vengeful Brothers in Arms ""Four Brothers"" Mark Wahlberg left Tyrese Gibson Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund. (George Kraychyk - George Kraychyk) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Michael OSullivan Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 12 2005 DIRECTOR JOHN Singletons avowed love of John Wayne movies is readily apparent in ""Four Brothers"" a western without cowboy hats. Set in Detroit where the hombres bad and good ride through town on steeds of steel instead of palominos the movie -- whose plot concerns the search by four once-troubled adopted brothers (Mark Wahlberg OutKasts Andre Benjamin Tyrese Gibson and Garrett Hedlund) for the guys who killed the saintly woman who raised them (Fionnula Flanagan) -- isnt just any old western but a revenge western. As such it doesnt have room for such things as nuance of character or moral complexity. The good guys are the good guys even if theyre not above breaking the law (and a few bones) themselves in the pursuit of payback. And the bad guys are well very very bad even if some of them in the end demonstrate a change of heart. If the movie doesnt have room for doubt of any kind thats because it is at heart small. It does what it does which is to satisfy a need to see vengeance exacted (and of a rather base variety) and then it gets out. Quick? Not especially. Not at close to two hours. Clean? Hardly with the high body count in the wake of the boys destruction. But small nonetheless. I mentioned that ""Four Brothers"" was set in Detroit but its really a fantasia of that city in the way that westerns are fantasias of the West. Its a Detroit where everyone plays hockey black and white; where the cops are incompetent corrupt doomed or nonexistent (especially during one protracted bullet-strewn chase scene through deserted snow-covered streets); and where the iced-over lake is merely photogenic set dressing for the climactic showdown between the mobster villain (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the main hero (Wahlberg whose deeply furrowed brow is starting to look like Ice Cubes). My biggest problem with ""Four Brothers"" is not what it is. As a revenge fantasy its fairly satisfying and the twists have just enough torque to maintain interest. My problem is more with how it accomplishes its goals than with what they are. Thats because for all its well-drawn lines between good and evil ""Four Brothers"" is ultimately passive entertainment. As storytelling the script by David Elliot and Paul Lovett doesnt ask the audience to participate -- to share the protagonists emotions such as grief -- so much as it insists that we sit back and enjoy the bloody ride. To the extent that we know the main characters at all we know them as types barely reformed hot-tempered thug Bobby (Wahlberg); ladies man Angel (Gibson); straight-arrow married businessman Jeremiah (Benjamin); and wussy aspiring rock star Jack (Hedlund). As we follow them in their search -- not so much for justice as for brutal retribution -- whats most disturbing is how were made not to care. About anything. Not to care whether theyve got the right perps or whether the perps even deserve the summary execution theyre handed. I wasnt just troubled by the fact that several members of the audience laughed whenever someone got shot in the head but that the movie seemed to actively encourage such a reaction. If ""Four Brothers"" spent half as much energy making us feel something for its heroes as it spent making us feel nothing for their victims it would be a far better and far more engaging film.

"Four Brothers in Mayhem washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Four Brothers in Mayhem In ""Four Brothers"" Andre Benjamin left Garrett Hedlund Mark Wahlberg and Tyrese Gibson start blowing things up when their Ma is slain. (By George Kraychyk -- Paramount Studios Via Reuters) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday August 12 2005 A Russian general once declared that the way his army cleared minefields was to march through them. Its as if he changed his career choice and went to Hollywood and ended up directing ""Four Brothers"" which shows that same crazed relentless march and damn-the-consequences theory of operation. The movie -- directed in fact by John Singleton not Marshal Zhukov -- is loud stupid unrealistic overdone without a thought in its ugly little head and kind of enjoyable. Basically its just an urban revenge melodrama full of heinous murders and righteous vengeance-takings without a thought to plausibility. Its two best performances turn out to be at the edges not the center. As for the nominal heroes played by Mark Wahlberg Tyrese Gibson Andre Benjamin (half of the enormously popular hip-hop duo OutKast) and Garrett Hedlund it could be said that they are serviceable without any danger of distinction. Any four guys picked off a bus between LaBrea and Fairfax (or 13th and Connecticut) could have done just as well. The two stunning performances in ""Four Brothers"" come from Terrence Dashon Howard whos just broken out in ""Hustle amp; Flow"" as a cop; and the great Nigerian actor Chiwetel Ejiofor -- brilliant in ""Dirty Pretty Things"" -- as the really scary villain. The two of them -- ach what are all those losers doing between them? -- are believable without being overbearing commanding without being loud authentic without showing off too much research. Memo to Tinseltown Make a movie starring these guys on opposite sides and baby youd have something special. The movie begins with the murder of Ma. Poor Ma those 12-gauge shotguns do you no good at all. Ma Mercer a kind of community activist/gadfly type represented (""played"" would be too strong a word) by Fionnula Flanagan happens to be in a Detroit convenience market when some bad boys take it down. She goes down with it. Her four adopted sons want justice. I suppose this marks a step forward in civilization in that the foursome are broken down into racially harmonious components showing that white and black can coexist respect and even love one another. It even develops that the villains are racially diverse. Fortunately before the movie becomes an Up With People ad the shooting resumes. And once it does it hardly ever stops except to make a little room for the beatings and explosions. Not exactly what you call your touchy-feely thing. The four guys as I say are okay. The defining characteristic seems to be that all are stupid Wahlbergs Bobby the stupidest of all. If hes not yelling hes barking and if hes not barking hes shooting or punching. A subplot briefly puts one of them -- Benjamins Jeremiah -- under suspicion but if he were the bad guy why would the movie be called ""Four Brothers""? If the guys suspect someone was involved in the killing they just show up and pull a roscoe. They may shoot they may slug they may chase in a car they may just intimidate by general rowdiness and noise but they are never subtle. This is so even at a high school basketball game where they take an entire crowd and all the players hostage. Oddly the police dont seem to mind. Theres a plot not that I understood it. It turns out that Ma wasnt knocked off in random violence but as part of a larger scheme. But more engrossing by far than the story were the endless action sequences. My favorite involved thugs with weapons so advanced the SEAL teams arent using them in the sandbox yet. They turn the Mercer family homestead into a lace doily for about 10 minutes. There is also a very nice car chase through the snow (again the cops dont notice) as well as a kind of mano a mano on frozen reaches of Lake Superior that had an existential grandeur to it. As a background for a story untouched by morality the ruined burg of Motor City is appropriately grotesque. The movie may siphon off at least a dozen IQ points but it does make time fly. Four Brothers (108 minutes at area theaters) is rated R for violence gore and extreme profanity.

On a mission Andre Benjamin left Tyrese Gibson and Mark Wahlberg avenge death of their mother. Paramount Pictures Early observers of the film already have mentioned that this urban revenge piece spins off a 1965 movie John Waynes The Sons of Katie Elder. It too deals with four wayward brothers molded by a strong mother. When shots ring out of one car during the blizzard you almost envision a stagecoach. And the storys pro-vigilante sentiments are out of another century. So its a tad discomforting to watch the brothers with an almost larkish attitude see how many contusions and bullet wounds they can tally as they avenge their late moms ""hit"" in a convenience store stick-up. The movie and at least one cop almost seem to wink at the voluminous violence from the foursome -- who in a fresh story hook are white (Mark Wahlberg Garrett Hedlund) and black (Tyrese Gibson Andre Benjamin; aka Tyrese and Andre 3000). About the movie Four Brothers    (out of four) Stars Mark Wahlberg Tyrese Gibson Andre Benjamin Garrett Hedlund Terrence Howard Chiwetel Ejiofor Director John Singleton Distributor Paramount Running time 1 hour 48 minutes Rated R for strong violence pervasive language and some sexual content Opens Friday nationwide The brotherly bond has come about because the mom (Fionnula Flanagan oozing all the flashback blarney her name portends) took in four boys who were considered such lost causes that every other surrogate parent balked. After Singleton overdoes it with horseplay to show how well the four get along the movie takes off. Helping out a lot are several choice villains including the strikingly versatile Chiwetel Ejiofor as a hood ringleader. (He also played the sympathetic doctor in 2002s Dirty Pretty Things.) Also contributing are alumni from the superb Hustle amp; Flow (which Singleton produced) Terrence Howard as the friendly cop and Taraji P. Henson as Benjamins wife. The half-true rap on Singleton has been that his cinematic passion has seemed diminished since his 1991 Boyz N the Hood debut. Yet 2001s seriously underrated Baby Boy and now this film have shown some heat. The sometimes absurd Brothers works only on a larger-than-life level. But on that level the zest is back.

Starring Mark Wahlberg Andre Benjamin Tyrese Gibson Garrett Hedlund and Terrence Howard. Directed by John Singleton. (R 110 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Like a lot of successful directors John Singleton seems to divide his time equally between personal films and pay-the-bills projects. For every ""Boyz N the Hood"" moviegoers can expect at least one ""Shaft"" or ""2 Fast 2 Furious."" ""Four Brothers"" is definitely in the latter category. Its a solidly built yet forgettable revenge action movie that is notable mostly for its outstanding young cast. Nobodys going to be talking about ""Four Brothers"" four months from now but its nice to see that Mark Wahlberg has finally exorcised the last ghosts of the Funky Bunch from his soul. Wahlberg is enjoyable as Bobby Mercer the wildest of four former juvenile delinquents who were adopted by a tough-love maternal figure in their Detroit neighborhood. Two of the brothers are white (Garrett Hedlund plays the youngest brother) and two are black (rappers Tyrese Gibson and Andre Benjamin) a fact that the screenwriters mine for humor throughout the movie. When tragedy strikes Mama Mercer the brothers reunite in an attempt to solve a complicated criminal plot. Instead of engaging detective work (in most movies like this at least one brother is a cop) they use their powers of thuggery going on a spree of consequence-free violence that will make moviegoers wonder if Michigan even has a 911 call center. The best parts in ""Four Brothers"" come when the Mercer boys arent pointing guns or dousing people in gasoline and threatening to set them on fire -- which happens more than once in the film. Wahlberg and Gibson in particular stand out as complicated men who were saved from an early death by their mother figure but still teeter on the edge of personal destruction. More action directors should include scenes such as the Mercers extended Thanksgiving dinner which fleshes out the bond between the brothers without using too many words. No amount of ""I love you man"" dialogue can equal the impact of the ""Four Brothers"" scene in which three of the siblings carry on a casual conversation in a small bathroom -- with one brother in the shower another on the toilet and a third standing in the hallway with a bathrobe. Singleton establishes early on that his characters are capable of anything and that unpredictability -- along with an R rating -- gives the action more grit. But it quickly becomes apparent that more thought went into the characters than the plot. The twists and turns seem incidental and every scene involving police officers is completely unbelievable. Josh Charles (""Dead Poets Society"") isnt hard enough for his bad cop detective role and unfortunately Terrence Howard shows up in the good cop role -- not the ""Hustle amp; Flow"" Howard whom audiences may be hoping for. Singleton goes for something high-energy and retro -- the score used during chase scenes has a blaxploitation vibe -- and the finished product has enough crowd-pleasing moments to make mainstream audiences happy in the short run. But make no mistake his next film will probably be a lot better. -- Advisory This film contains profanity sexual situations brutal violence and the brain-searing three-minute scene of Mark Wahlberg sitting on a toilet.

(CNN) -- ""Four Brothers"" is a dark and brooding drama about revenge and retribution. Set on the dirty streets of Detroit Michigan and directed by John Singleton (""Boyz N the Hood"") this film plays out like an urban version of an old-fashioned Western.Four adopted brothers -- two white and two black -- are reunited when their mother Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) is murdered during an apparent holdup at a small grocery store.Leading the pack in an effort to bring down the killers is the oldest brother Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) a man who acts first and thinks later. Angel Mercer (Tyrese Gibson) is Mister Cool mainly concerned with his libido and trying to control his hot-headed girlfriend Sofi (Sofia Vergara). Jeremiah Mercer (Andre Benjamin) has become a family man with a business in trouble. The youngest brother Jack (Garrett Hedlund) is a wannabe rock star who is both ridiculed and protected by his older brothers.All four are tough street-smart guys who would probably be dead or in prison if it hadnt been for their mother. It soon becomes apparent that Evelyns death was not just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. She was a target; the robbery was just window dressing.As the brothers start looking for revenge the Detroit police step in led by Lt. Green (played by Terrence Howard who is long overdue for stardom). Green grew up with the brothers and had a deep respect for their mother. His partner however Det. Fowler (Josh Charles) views them with disdain.Various clues come to light and all roads lead to a sinister gangster named Victor Sweet (British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor best known for the movie ""Love Actually"") who rules Detroits underworld. Bodies start dropping and of course the brothers and the police clash as both groups try to solve the murder.The main reason this films works so well is that Singleton has assembled an excellent cast to play the brothers. Wahlberg who grew up in a poor environment gives one of his best performances to date. He clearly knows his character and plays him to a T.Benjamin is remarkably good. Of course hes best known as one-half of the Grammy Award-winning musical duo OutKast.Gibson who delivers a well-balanced performance as Angel is also a well-known musician and has worked with Singleton before in the films ""Baby Boy"" and ""2 Fast 2 Furious.""Rounding out the pack is Hedlund in the role of Jack. He made his feature film debut in ""Troy"" opposite Brad Pitt. His is perhaps the hardest role since he needs to be both tough and vulnerable.The screenplay by David Elliot and Paul Lovett and the direction by Singleton results in a taut character-driven film with plenty of action. And youll find yourself buying into the conceit that these four disparate men two African-American and two Caucasian are actually bonded as brothers.You have to suspend disbelief and go along with the absence of any real police procedure and the fact that after numerous killings the boys all go scot-free. But its not the first film -- and wont be the last -- in which the heroes fail to suffer the consequences of their actions.Overall this gritty melodrama delivers the goods. The wonderful soundtrack -- a collection of Motowns oldies but goodies -- is icing on the cake.

"As revenge thrillers go Brothers is sweet and sour - The Boston Globe Movies    Restaurants    Food    Calendar    Music    Theater/Arts    TV    Books    Celebrity news    Games Home gt; Aamp;E gt; Movies MOVIE REVIEW As revenge thrillers go Brothers is sweet and sour By Ty Burr Globe Staff  |  August 12 2005 If you havent figured out that Four Brothers"" the new John Singleton film is an intentionally scrappy throwback to mid-70s action flicks the scene in which the Mercer brothers childhood home is shot up by gangsters should set you straight. As wood splinters go flying windows shatter and cherished framed photos bite the dust Singleton treats us to a shot of a vintage vinyl record player shuddering in its death throes. Have these villains no shame?On one level Four Brothers"" represents a distinct comedown for the director of the socially conscious Boyz N the Hood"" and Baby Boy"" and producer of the art-house hit Hustle amp; Flow."" Its not even as slick as his 2000 remake of Shaft"" or his perfunctory sequel duties on 2 Fast 2 Furious."" A nominal inner-city rehash of the 1965 John Wayne western The Sons of Katie Elder"" Brothers"" is a faux-low-budget revenge thriller pure and simple. Theres nothing special about it and thats whats refreshing.Set against a snaky ear-tickling backdrop of Motown hits and Philly soul classics Four Brothers"" starts with a little old lady (Fionnula Flanagan of The Others"") getting gunned down during a convenience store holdup in her ratty Detroit neighborhood. It turns out Evelyn Mercer was a social worker with a history of adopting worst-case delinquents no one else would touch; now this multiracial crew is all grown up and ready to settle scores with Moms killer.Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) is the oldest and de facto leader blowing into town with all sorts of ill winds at his back. Angel (model/rapper/Ramp;B balladeer Tyrese Gibson) is ex-Army and ex-prison. Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin a.k.a. Andre 3000 of OutKast) is the good son married with kids and holding a job. Youngest brother Jack (Garrett Hedlund Friday Night Lights"") is a wannabe rock musician and jittery basket case. The four quickly realize Moms death was no random murder but an intentional hit.I could tell you where the plot goes from there but whats the point? Four Brothers"" goes into B-movie lockdown as soon as everyone is assembled and the action spreads out to take in a crooked local councilman (played by the wonderful phlegmatic character actor Barry Shabaka Henley) a sympathetic cop (Hustle amp; Flow"" star Terrence Howard) a less sympathetic cop (nerdy Josh Charles of Sports Night"" snarling with abandon) and a crime kingpin dandy named Victor Sweet (surprise -- its that nice British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor of Dirty Pretty Things"" and Love Actually""). Sweets such a nasty piece of work that not only does he force a henchman (Jernard Burks) to get on the floor and eat like a dog -- he makes the henchmans girlfriend do the same.Well its a mans mans mans mans world to quote the one Ramp;B chestnut not on the films soundtrack. Taraji P. Henson one of the best things in Hustle amp; Flow"" is wasted in the tiny part of Jeremiahs wife while Sofia Vergara does what she can with her crazy-hot-tamale role of Angels girlfriend. To be fair Four Brothers"" is mostly a leading mans world since Hedlund and Benjamin have little to do Gibson preens and Wahlberg wraps whats left of the movie around his pinky and twirls it with bad-boy relish. If anyone still wonders if the kid has star quality trust me -- he has.What Four Brothers"" doesnt have is particularly skilled direction. Grubby to look at and edited with a rusty knife its a bumptious low-rent ride and further proof that Singleton for all his status and acclaim doesnt have impressive filmmaking chops. The movies strengths are in its juicy performances unapologetic mayhem and the few change-ups thrown by David Elliot and Paul Lovetts script (love that showdown on a frozen Lake Michigan by the way) not in the verities of camera placement narrative pacing and so forth. Dont get me wrong -- this is solid meat-and-potatoes stuff. But Singleton may want us to think hes stooping to conquer when it really feels like he has finally found his level.

Paramount release should make some late-summer B.O. noise as crowd-pleasing down-and-dirty melodrama spiked with profanely funny sass. With equal measures of rock-the-house vigor and in-your-face attitude ""Four Brothers"" proves usually potent and consistently enjoyable as an old school approach to what might best be described as the urban-Western genre of slam-bang balls-out action-revenger. The tasty soundtrack of wall-to-wall Motown golden oldies is only the most obvious indication that helmer John Singleton has blaxploitation homage on his mind. Even so pic is refreshingly free of wink-wink allusions and self-referential ironies. Paramount release should make some late-summer B.O. noise as crowd-pleasing down-and-dirty melodrama spiked with profanely funny sass. Homevid biz will be equally muscular. Movie buffs may suspect scripters David Elliot and Paul Lovett are tipping their Stetsons to Henry Hathaways ""The Sons of Katie Elder"" (1965) with a plot that pivots on four disparate and disreputable siblings who reunite to avenge a parents murder. But similarities to the earlier pic are more apparent than real and they are forgotten entirely as soon as tough-loving Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) is fatally shot during what initially seems like a random grocery holdup. Effectively introed to the sound of Marvin Gayes soulfully swaggering ""Trouble Man"" grim-faced ex-con Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) returns to wintry inner-city Detroit for the funeral of his beloved adoptive mother. Sad occasion reunites Bobby with his three brothers -- hunky ex-Marine Angel (Tyrese Gibson) family man and former union activist Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) and punkish hard-rocker Jack (Garrett Hedlund) -- who also were raised by Evelyn. Except for one or two genuinely funny gags Singleton wisely refrains from making a big deal out of the fact that two brothers are African-American (Angel Jeremiah) and two Caucasian (Bobby Jack). Pic places more emphasis on brothers common background as throwaway delinquents who were rescued from foster-care system by Evelyn. (A nice touch Evelyns generosity of spirit is seriocomically credited to her youthful hippiedom.) To be sure the boys didnt exactly grow into untarnished sterling citizens. But according to Lt. Green (Terrence Howard) a childhood buddy turned Detroit cop ""These kids are congressmen compared to what they could have been"" without Evelyn. Determined to answer blood with blood the Mercer brothers rightly figure theyre better equipped than the cops to track their mothers killers. It doesnt take them long to discover the robbery wasnt random and to deduce the robbers were hired killers employed by Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor) a sadistic mobster with dirty cops on his payroll and a personal interest in Jeremiahs business plans. Clocking in at a tight 108 minutes pic feels neither dawdling nor unduly rushed. Singleton is unafraid to slow the tempo for scenes like a character-revealing Thanksgiving dinner (brightened with a bold touch of magical realism). But when Singleton kicks out the jams during the hard-core rough stuff -- especially during a slipping-and-sliding car chase during a snowstorm and a full-out assault on the Mercer home -- helmer delivers the goods with edgy kinetic flair. Editors Bruce Cannon and Billy Fox do standout work and nothing ever gets too hyped too abstract too videogamish. Much like this years ""Assault on Precinct 13"" remake ""Four Brothers"" makes a virtue of blunt brawny 70s-style simplicity. Much of pics appeal stems from terrifically engaging interplay among four well-cast leads. Wahlberg scores as an insolent hothead whos much smarter and more sentimental than he wants to appear. Gibson (of Singletons ""Baby Boy"" and ""2 Fast 2 Furious"") strikes apt balance between smooth moves as lover (with sexy co-star Sofia Vergara) and brute force as avenger. OutKast hip-hopper Benjamin continues to demonstrate strong acting chops while up-and-comer Hedlund (""Troy"" ""Friday Night Lights"") makes a vivid impression as youngest sibling whos still the butt of merciless ribbing. Standout supporting players include two alumni of Singleton-produced ""Hustle amp; Flow"" -- attention-grabbing Howard and vulnerable Taraji P. Henson (as Jeremiahs wife) -- and Brit-born Chiwetel Ejiofor (""Dirty Pretty Things"") totally convincing as a Detroit gangster who rules through intimidation and humiliation. Flanagan makes the most of flashback scenes. Overall tech package suggests mid-range budget was spent smartly to achieve rough-hewn but not slipshod look during location shooting in Detroit and Toronto. Motown hits are used extensively and often expressively. At the very end ""Trouble Man"" is reprised to achieve ineffably melancholy mood.

Still I refuse to believe Im a completely dispensable slice of the projected demographic pie. After all Ive got an abiding affection for the wily chameleon Mark Wahlberg who stars; a building excitement about charismatic Andre Benjamin from OutKast who made such an electrifying acting turn in Be Cool and who costars; and a scholarly interest in the quick rise and stalled artistic development of John Singleton who directs. So I think I have a right to ask Why is Four Brothers so cheesy? Why does it look like junk? Why are the lines so oafish the scenes so sloppily pasted together and the characters so false? Why is the action overrun with ugly gun violence automotive wreckage and death; why is the conversation drenched in casual jokey homophobia and racism? And why does such cut-rate stuff -- a diminution of everything important Singleton achieved 14 years ago with his riveting debut Boyz N the Hood -- get by shrugged off as just another diversion meant for a rowdy summertime crowd who doubtless think Im a twit for raising such dowdy objections? Why is Four Brothers considered good enough -- by John Singletons own standards? (He also produced but didnt direct the more capably made but equally inauthentic Hustle amp; Flow another sentimentalized retreat from the hard honesty of Boyz.) Hold that thought and consider the preposterous premise The Mercer siblings themselves are an artificially constructed Detroit family two white brothers and two black brought together as unwanted foster kids by their feisty saintly adoptive mother Evelyn Mercer (Irish stage stalwart Fionnula Flanagan assuming a stance of theatrical working-class rectitude often played by Lynn Redgrave) who raised her boys in a house of good manners that didnt stop them from getting into trouble. Evelyn is as present and nurturing a parent as Tre Styles mama wasnt in Boyz. And now Evelyn is dead gunned down in an apparent grocery store holdup. But when the grieving orphans -- now men -- reunite in their Detroit boyhood home for her funeral they smell something fishy about the story given by cops Green (Terrence Howard from Hustle amp; Flow in a thanklessly contrived role) and Fowler (Josh Charles in a role even worse) to explain the shooting. So they decide to investigate themselves and dispense a little justice Mercer brothers style. The trail of evidence leads to gang goons drug scum rotten cops crooked politicians whorish women Neanderthal contract killers a wack Detroit gangster in a pouffy fur jacket (fine British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor from Love Actually) and a lot of catchy Motown music thrown in to pump soundtrack sales. Its no accident that it has taken until now in this review to bother mentioning Wahlbergs work as tough-guy big brother Bobby; or Tyrese Gibson (a photogenic fave of the directors who also appeared in Singletons 2 Fast 2 Furious) as Angel a stud with the unslakable hots for girlfriend Sofi (Sofia Vergara) dubbed ""La Vida Loca"" by the rest of the family for her flights of Hispanic hotheadedness; or an undervalued Benjamin as Jeremiah a business-minded husband and father; or Troy pretty boy Garrett Hedlund as Jack a fawn-like rock musician the other sibs enjoy tormenting with tedious slurs questioning his sexuality. Built from a studio kit of ""types"" face-recognition factors and market-penetration charts this fraternal quartet has all the believability of the Village People. And Wahlberg with hair slicked back like a car salesmans and face lined with ennui looks particularly recycled more of a Pops trying to hang on to his glory days than a Number One Son. Because the script riddled with verbal ugliness by David Elliot and Paul Lovett sends the movie to a series of arbitrary nowheres the final showdown for the Mercer boys and their enemies is just as meaningless and sense-deadening. Get past the scene in a fake-swank restaurant where an insubordinate gang lieutenant and a random ho are forced to eat off the floor rumps in the air and you end up at a frozen-over fishing hole where the film pauses to peddle a crackpot message of labor-union solidarity. There is no Hood in Four Brothers and no Boyz either -- just Hollywood Men at Work risking nothing for an audience that isnt supposed to mind.
