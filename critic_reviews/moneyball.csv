If that sounds as thrilling as a Sudoku tournament think again. ""Moneyball"" is a winner one of the freshest and smartest sports movies in years. Based on Michael Lewis nonfiction book ""Moneyball"" only seems to be a classic underdog story. Its sort-of heroes are the 2002 Oakland As a cash-strapped team routinely pummeled by richer franchises. (The film opens with a 2001 trouncing by the Yankees.) ""There are rich teams there are poor teams"" observes general manager Billy Beane played by a rough-edged but vulnerable Brad Pitt. ""Then theres 50 feet of crap. And then theres us."" Billy distrusts the intuition of scouts; hes a former player who was pumped full of dreams but flopped on the field. Enter another not-quite hero Peter Brand (Jonah Hill seriously good) a Yale whiz kid with a different if somewhat soulless philosophy. ""Your goal shouldnt be to buy players"" Peter says ""it should be to buy wins."" Impressed Billy buys Peter.

Aided by spreadsheets and formulas Billy and Peter (a thinly disguised version of Paul DePodesta now the Mets vice president of player development) build an unexciting but winning team despite resistance from old-fashioned field manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The result is a history-making 20-game winning streak but wait -- do we really want the bean counters to be right? Initially planned as a quasidocumentary directed by Steven Soderbergh ""Moneyball"" was scrapped in 2009 and later relaunched with director Bennett Miller (""Capote"") who brings a sleek stylish vibe; co-writer Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") delivers his trademark slam-bang dialogue. Somehow the film reveals deep affection for Americas pastime while also acknowledging its cold bottom-line realities. Thats not the shower-of-sparks magic you normally see in a baseball movie but a magic all its own. Ex-player is more of a hit off the field advertisement | advertise on newsday Brad Pitt smiled when asked if baseball executive Billy Beanes strategy of signing undervalued talent to cheap contracts could work in Hollywood. ""Not if they hired me"" the highly paid star told reporters earlier this month at the Toronto International Film Festival. Pitt was in town to promote ""Moneyball"" based on Michael Lewiss best-seller about the system Beane pioneered with the Oakland Athletics. Pitt stars as Beane a highly touted prospect who had a short disappointing major-league career. He became a much more successful general manager assembling good teams with one of baseballs smallest payrolls. ""This is a guy whose life didnt turn out the way it was supposed to"" director Bennett Miller said. ""He was supposed to be a superstar . . . but it took him more than a decade toiling in failure before he accepted that it wasnt going to happen. So it ends up being much more than a sports story."" Newsday Tweets from Newsday/newsday-staff Even though Oakland has never reached the World Series during Beanes tenure as GM other teams have copied his methods. ""Its about questioning things we accept every day"" Pitt said. ""Just because weve been doing something the same way for so long doesnt mean that its right for today.

Over 55000 fans saw the Athletics blow a huge lead over Kansas City then win on Scott Hattebergs homer. It extended their great winning streak to 20 games and is now the movies sweet spot. But Moneyball is not sweet. Nor is it much about the mystique and glory the fabled field of dreams. It sticks close to Oaklands general manager Billy Beane a former hot prospect (raised in San Diego) who bombed in the major leagues as a player. Brad Pitt is at the top of his own game as Beane. Cocky and often nonchalant he is gnawed by doubts that he tries to cover by grabbing a snack or pitching a grin. When the Yankees use a money pot three times the size of Oaklands and hire away his star talents Beane determines to change the system (his predecessor Sandy Alderson had begun this process). He opts for ""sabermetrics"" a heavily computerized way of analyzing players that overrides gut hunches and conventional wisdom. The resentment of this by agents and coaches in meetings that are bull pens of male ego is personified by skeptical team manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman). The new approach is personified by Peter Brand a young statistician based on metrics guru Bill James and Beane assistant Paul DePodesta. As Brand who has a portrait of Plato above his bed Jonah Hill is virtually a Platonic form of soft fat nerdiness. Hills reach beyond his comedy image rivals that of Albert Brooks in Drive. The crafty Brand sees that his system is much more than a numbers game as Beane hires fires inspires and ramrods his players. Not very articulate his temper often outruns his tact. Baseball can have magic as in Hattebergs homer. Moneyball says it is also a science and ruthlessly a business. Men are traded like well-paid slaves or simply sent away. The storys bits of sugar come in the divorced Beanes connection with his daughter (Kerris Dorsey) but this reveals an essential side of him. The script went through many hands. The tiny appearance of Robin Wright as the girls mother feels like a fragment a leftover. But director Bennett Miller is true to form a wizard of taste and observational nuance. He keeps a close focus on Beane and gives us a keen sense of why ""moneyball"" metrics have spread through baseball. Miller has gone three times to the plate and scored each time The Cruise (1998) a poetic elevation of the portrait documentary starring New York dreamer Tim Levitch; Capote (2005) the most intelligently disturbing treatment of a major American writer which won Hoffman an Oscar; and now Moneyball a terrific brainy sports movie. Not since Cobb the 1994 Ty Cobb drama that could have been called Sourball has baseball had such adulthood on screen. Brad Pitt is so much more complex here than as the iron-butt dad in The Tree of Life. Surely some prime credit must go to Miller. The last shot of Beane while driving feels like a nod to Harry Dean Stantons poignant exit in Wim Wenderss Paris Texas. Given Millers kind of talent such an echo would be understandable. I Dont Know How She Does It  I Dont Know How She Does It A snack tray of zingers and fortune cookies. The obvious but effective tactic of I Dont Know How She Does It is to place Sarah Jessica Parker among younger and (lets be plain) prettier women. Thin as an x-ray she tirelessly outshines the other fems by drive pluck and a smile that could have cheered up Stalingrad during World War II. The SJP model for 2011 is named Kate Reddy which evokes Helen Reddy whose big song hit was ""I Am Woman."" Kate is a supermom and rising star of banking finance a rather slippery hook for comedy in these mad-at-big-money times. While juggling two kids and a nicely accommodating hubby (Greg Kinnear) traveling frequently eradicating lice cooking cell-phoning emailing PowerPointing and teleconferencing she also wows the rich but lonely wiz of biz Jack Abelhammer (Pierce Brosnan) whose virile name leads to a suspensefully delayed penis joke. Kates gal-pals mostly talk about her with awe and praise and chuckling delight. Douglas McGrath directed as if taking brisk notes from Kate who is always making lists. There are perky graphics balloons and parties. On a trip to Cleveland Jack and Kate bond with regular salt-of-life folk by bowling. Once banker Jack nails some strikes they think he is fabulous (one can safely assume that Michael Moore was not a consultant for this picture). The script is a snack tray of zingers and fortune cookies like this one from Kate ""Having a two-year-old boy is like being a movie star in a world without critics."" Which is fairly amusing if you know that Allison Pearson Welsh writer of the source novel is married to New Yorker movie critic Anthony Lane. Her book has been altered into a shrine for SJP as a force of female nature more engaging (if no less commercial) than in Sex and the City 2. Mysteries of Lisbon  Mysteries of Lisbon Old-fashioned succulence. Raul Ruiz who died at 70 on Aug. 19 made over 100 movies. Some are lost many were poorly distributed and I have seen few. The Chilean-born often TV-funded auteur was almost as driven by the muse of narrative abundance as Fernando Pessoa Portugals titan of polyphonic prose. Ruiz was an experimenter who as scholarly critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote was able to ""combine some aspect of the laboratory and the playpen."" Mysteries of Lisbon has sustained power for 266 minutes flowing like spun silk from the classic Portuguese novel by Camilo Castelo Branco (adapted by Ruiz and Carlos Saboga). At first daunting the length becomes absorbing. I would willingly sit through the six-hour TV version subtitles permitting. The trimmer edition is at the Ken Cinema Sept. 23-29. The axis of the plot (measly word) is the joined fate of a sensitive orphan and a supportive priest. In the 19th Century the boys story is the starter for skillfully laced and layered stories and historical events. They revolve (as in Tolstoy Stendhal Flaubert) around the mystery of human character. Confusion is kept minimal by lucid acting by serenely beautiful settings shot deep-focus in long takes and by such blithe touches as a paper puppet theater and paintings that mutate. Old-fashioned succulence feels very freshly alive.

Where The Social Network was a steely satirical study of privilege run amok Moneyball is a colourful old-fashioned sports movie - albeit with darker undertones than your average fist-pumping underdog story. Brad Pitt essays his best loveable rogue as Billy Beane manager of baseballs perennial outsiders the Oakland Athletics who takes a punt on a statistical system of recruiting players devised by ball-obsessed Yale graduate Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). Money-men sneer commentators scoff and fans moan but as the season progresses this odd couple find themselves sitting on an unprecedented winning streak.For viewers unfamiliar with the game the constant discussion of bunts walks and flies coupled with some intentionally impenetrable statistics chat renders chunks of Moneyball incomprehensible. But Sorkins typically prickly epithet-peppered script plus winning turns from the entire cast make for a consistently pleasurable watch.The problem is one of focus there are often too many characters to keep track of (Philip Seymour Hoffman is underused as the teams irascible coach) and while the first two acts deliver one-liners and sporting action in abundance a muted home stretch is bold but unsatisfying undermining much of what went before. Nonetheless as an example of smarter-than-average Hollywood fare - and a sly dig at modern sporting politics - Moneyball has all the key bases covered.

Jones Jr_Jones Moneyball MONEYBALL  Directed by Bennett Miller Moneyball Michael Lewiss best seller about the Oakland Athletics remarkable 2002 season ends with one of those baseball moments that etch themselves into the memory. Jeremy Brown an obese catcher for the University of Alabama had been ridiculed endlessly in the press after the As named him as a first-round draft choice. In a minor-league game that year Brown hit a line drive into center field and began hauling himself around the bases. ""Between first and second base his feet go out from under him and he backflops into the dirt like Charlie Brown"" writes Lewis. ""He picks himself up to scramble back to the safety of first base when he sees his teammates in the dugout. The guys are falling all over each other laughing."" As Brown looks around he realizes the humiliation is all in his head the ball has landed in the stands and hes hit a home run. In the new movie adapted from the book As general manager Billy Beane watches this play on a video screen and asks in voice-over ""How can you not be romantic about baseball?"" The question is ironic to say the least because Beane has been accused of draining all the romance from the game. Faced with a daunting gap between what his team and the richest teams could spend on ballplayers--the As payroll for 2002 was about 40 million whereas the New York Yankees was 126 million--Beane set out to reinvent his club by unloading overvalued players and shopping for bargains. Guided by the radical ideas of baseball statistician Bill James and assisted by Paul DePodesta a young Harvard graduate with a degree in economics Beane served notice to his grizzled scouting staff that they would no longer be judging prospects based on their looks their builds their personalities or any of the other intangibles that scouts mystically invoked when trying to predict a players future performance. From now on players would be reduced to a set of complex statistics that would reveal their ability to do what counted most--score runs. All this makes Moneyball a fascinating business book but an unlikely candidate for a baseball movie. From Pride of the Yankees (1942) to Bang the Drum Slowly (1973) to Bull Durham (1988) to Sugar (2008) dramas about baseball have always been steeped in romance whether they follow a winner on his way up or a loser on his way out. The central tenet of this romance is that a person can defy other peoples estimations of him and accomplish bigger things than he ever imagined. More than any other team sport baseball focuses our attention on individuals trying to realize their true potential which is what makes the grand slams so sweet and the strikeouts so bitter. Moneyball asks us to root for a team whose management saw every player not as a person capable of greatness but as a set of stats to be fed into an algorithm. If youve just lost your job as a result of some digital innovation this is probably not the movie to cheer you up. Screenwriters Steven Zaillian (Schindlers List A Civil Action) and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network Charlie Wilsons War) certainly had their work cut out for them when they hired on to dramatize Lewiss book. Interspersed with the narrative about Oaklands 2002 season are long unfilmable stretches in which Lewis debunks the misleading statistics that have governed baseball since the 19th century and explains the ""sabermetrics"" that Beane and Podesta used in their scheme to neutralize the money factor. For instance players have long been evaluated by RBI--runs batted in--yet that figure involves so many uncontrolled factors (like the number of men who happen to be on base when the player comes to bat) that its almost useless for measuring someones contribution to the game score. Much more accurate according to the sabermetricians is OBP--on-base percentage or the probability that the batter wont cause an out. Its engrossing stuff but the screenplay barely touches on it. Instead Zaillian and Sorkin have mined the text for human stories and hung them like Christmas ornaments on the larger arc of the 2002 season. One of the more affecting subplots centers on Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) a catcher for the Boston Red Sox whose career appeared to be over when he ruptured a nerve in his elbow during the 2001 season. The movie introduces Hatteberg with a partly invented scene where he sits glumly in the family room of his home as the clock strikes midnight marking the contractual end of his career. A moment later the phone rings its Billy Beane whos literally standing outside the house with his infield coach Ron Washington. Invited in they greet Hattebergs wife and little daughter and then get down to business Beane is mightily impressed by Hattebergs OBP and wants to sign him to the As as long as hell take on the challenge of playing first base. After the two men leave Hatteberg and his wife share a lovely moment together rejoicing in their good fortune as his sense of self-worth is unexpectedly renewed.

By Peter Rainer Film critic September 23 2011 Save for later Saved Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill work to make over major league baseball in ""Moneyball."" COLUMBIA PICTURES/Album/Newscom          View Caption About video ads View Caption of ""Moneyball"" is a baseball movie that is of course being promoted as more than just another baseball movie. Why the inferiority complex? As ""Bull Durham"" and ""The Bad News Bears"" and many other films have already demonstrated baseball movies are just fine being about just baseball.Maybe the motivation behind all this ""more than baseball"" stuff is that baseball movies except in Japan and Latin America are not big sellers overseas where Hollywood films often make half their money. Better not to be typecast.On the other hand Brad Pitt who stars in ""Moneyball"" as real-life Oakland As general manager Billy Beane is a global movie star. He is also on occasion an excellent actor and this is one of those occasions. He provides ballast and a swaggering humor to a movie that too often strives to be ""The Social Network"" of baseball movies. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? No surprise there since that films producer Scott Rudin and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin are also on board for this one. (The coscreenwriter is Steven Zaillian.) But the overrated ""The Social Network"" was about a cultural game changer. ""Moneyball"" based on the eponymous nonfiction bestseller by Michael Lewis is about something lesser. Lewiss book is subtitled ""The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" and that aptly describes the film. How did a small-market team like the 2002 Oakland As stay competitive with the lavishly moneyed likes of the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox? Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The answer was to remake the game. Instead of using seasoned scouts and coaches to seek out promising ballplayers using traditional methods and hunches Beane had a ""better"" idea. Utilizing the system of resident spreadsheet nerd and recent Yale economics graduate Peter Brand (a composite character played by Jonah Hill) he single-mindedly went after low-priced overlooked players with a high on-base plus slugging percentage or OPS. These are the players who actually score runs.Director Bennett Miller whose feature debut was the excellent ""Capote"" knows that a tangle of flow charts and on-base statistics isnt going to cut it with audiences even though that tangle is central to Beanes make-over of the game. Miller keeps the wonk factor to a blessed minimum. Some of the films funniest moments play against the wonkiness as when Peter faced with a roomful of leathery cynical scouts calmly cites his stats while managing to look both imperious and mortified.At the same time Miller must also realize that ""Moneyball"" at least superficially deromanticizes the game by reducing its successes to mundane number crunching. This is why he plays up Beane as a maverick a glorious eccentric even though what Beane is doing is by ordinary standards anathema to the spirit of baseball. (Beanes counterpart is the As grizzled manager Art Howe wonderfully played by Philip Seymour Hoffman.) In place of the traditional sentimentalism about the glory of the game Miller substitutes a dubious alternative scenario in which Beanes hard-earned successes are played down. Thats how ""Moneyball"" works ""heart"" into a movie about the inutility of making front office decisions with your heart instead of your head.The 2002 Oakland As may not have won the division pennant or the World Series but they came pretty close. They had a phenomenal run. The filmmakers although they pay lip service to the competition-free values of gamesmanship make it seem as if winning it all and winning nothing are lifes only two options. They buy all too eagerly into Beanes funk at not being champ.They also buy a bit too dearly into the whole OPS methodology. The As after all had only the seventh-highest major league OPS percentage in 2002 and the third highest in their division. (The film neglects to mention this.) Obviously other factors were at work in their success. And you may have noticed heavily bankrolled teams like the Yankees and the Red Sox arent exactly hurting in the wins columns these days.""Moneyball"" presents a misleading story line in order to prop up Billy Beane as some kind of would-be miracle worker antihero. In truth hes just another tobacco-chewing go-getter trying to make sense of a game that thankfully has never quite made sense. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for some strong language.)

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Some famously vexed studio projects stay vexed from start to screen to box office. ""Moneyball"" -- which had a bumpy journey toward completion -- will not be one of them. The chief reason for this good news is Brad Pitt who stayed in the game when it looked unwinnable. He portrays Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane. But Pitt who has a producing credit is not the sole reason this tremendous -- yet intimate -- sports tale soars over the fences. The bench is deep. And the script has a powerful but finessed swing. ""Moneyball"" is based on Michael Lewis 2003 book about moneys influence on major-league baseball and Beanes attempt to build a great team using statistical calculations championed by a guy named Bill James. The books subtitle is ""The Art of Winning an Unfair Game."" The deep-pocketed teams win and poach win and poach. But the low-budget franchises are treated like farm teams with little hope of swinging at the last ball of the postseason. When we first meet Beane its 2001 and the mid-market As are playing George Steinbrenners super-rich Yankees in the league division series. Class warfare? You bet. Jonah Hill the still-young veteran of raunchy comedies like ""Superbad"" and ""Knocked Up"" takes a quieter tone as Peter Brand the economist Beane brings into the clubhouse to help him find some talent he can afford. Pitt and Hill have amusing and surprisingly touching chemistry. Philip Seymour Hoffmans turn as Art Howe the gruff and defiant As manager proves that good chemistry doesnt have to be nice. His sallow tired visage gives a new face to insubordination. Director Bennett Millers gift for understated yet emotionally true rhythms of drama serves this sports saga and its leading man well. Pitt is having a storied year. At summers start he captured the tough-loving failings of a 1950s father in Terrence Malicks ""The Tree of Life."" In ""Moneyball"" some of his finest scenes take place far from the Oakland stadium as the divorced father spends time with his wise but not too-wise daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey). Robin Wright plays his ex. Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkins screenplay has plenty of quiet wit. Pitt seizes the opportunities to smile with rueful awareness. But it is also rife with the emotional spasms that professional athletes feel but for which they have no fast-acting analgesic fix. Chris Pratt and Stephen Bishop are especially good as washed-up players Scott Hatteberg and David Justice. One has nerve damage in his arm. The others legs are just too old. As a young man Beane was the sort of player who comes along rarely but never fulfilled the scouts living-room pitches. Thats a career arc rife with ache and doubt. Pitt moves with physical and psychological agility between the guy who was going to be great and a man still bent on fielding a great team. One of the finest achievements of ""Moneyball"" is that it reconnects fans to the human- scale hopes and sorrows of men trying to stay in a game theyve loved since boyhood. Enter the theater exhausted by the big salaries and outsized egos or just plain heartsick about our beloved Rockies. Or harboring the disappointments of another mediocre summer movie season. No matter which state speaks to you you wont leave ""Moneyball"" feeling that way.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Sep. 23 2011 600AM EDT Last updated Friday Sep. 23 2011 856AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English In baseball circles ""moneyball"" is a new solution to an age-old problem - how to evaluate players to assemble a winning team. In baseball movie circles Moneyball is an equally fresh approach to a different old problem - how to make a sports flick with wide general appeal. As a formula for victory moneyball has enjoyed only mixed success. As a film Moneyball fares much better first by signing a box-office star like Brad Pitt then by turning the stately game into something few can resist - a smart and lively comedy of manners. The source is the Michael Lewis book a superbly researched account of the 2002 Oakland As their general manager Billy Beane and his necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention strategy. Partly the book is a lesson in harsh economics the ""necessity"" that requires small franchises to compete with rich powerhouses like the Yankees on a third of the budget. Partly its a study in sabermetrics the ""invention"" that applies a complex set of computer-generated measurements to assess the true worth of hitherto undervalued players - essentially a tool allowing relatively impoverished GMs to shop for athletic bargains like a shrewd buyer at a garage sale. But mainly most intriguingly the book is a character study of Billy Beane (Pitt) an enigmatic guy of many contradictions. Thats where the film places its focus checking out those contradictions and doing what comedies of manners always do - finding humour in the staid beliefs perpetuated by the class system of a closed society. Of course such comedies are always fuelled by quick banter which is pretty much the specialty of co-writer Aaron Sorkin. Here the social network is located deep in the inner sanctum of the clubhouse where Billy the rebel takes on the old guard. This is his dilemma. The As have just lost their three best players all signed by affluent teams dangling big bucks. Cost-effective replacements must be found but how? Says Beane ""Weve got to think differently."" However sitting around the table like an ancient Greek chorus the grizzled scouts are locked into their conventional wisdom prizing only uber-athletes with expensive price tags. Ironically as a brief flashback tells us they prize the very sort of player Billy Beane used to be. Now comes the final irony. Billy was a ""cant miss prospect"" who missed never amounting to much. In other words in todays talent hunt Beane is in the business of negating himself of seeking out his less gaudy but more productive antithesis. Help arrives in the unlikely shape of Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a pudgy Yale grad with a degree in economics zero baseball experience a well-oiled computer and the strong opinion that ""baseball thinking is medieval."" Well that heresy is music to Beanes desperate ears. So the comedy shifts into odd-couple terrain the ex-jock teaming with the classic nerd to buck the establishment by putting the new math into embodied action. Enter the bodies misshapen ones like Scott Hatteburg a failed catcher cursed with a dumpy frame but blessed with what Brands computer cherishes above all else - a knack for getting on base by any means necessary. From there its one more case of David versus Goliath as the cast-offs overcome a shaky start and their recalcitrant manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to embark on a record-setting 20-game win streak. Exciting? Not really. This aint Miracle on Ice here. The on-field action is muted and the film suffers from a dearth of plot - another old but apparently essential convention. Most baseball movies pursue the romance of the game - the romance of the flawed Adonis ( The Natural) the romance of nostalgia ( Field of Dreams) or simply the romance of the romcom ( Bull Durham). But emphasizing cold statistical logic sabermetrics is anti-romantic - disdaining the excitement of the stolen base or the artistry of the sacrifice bunt it favours productivity over emotion. To make amends director Bennett Miller shifts his gaze from the diamond to his rough protagonist. As he did in Capote another tale of a rebel attacking convention Miller looks to inner conflicts for drama - Beane the calculated logician against Beane the fiercely intense water-cooler-kicking competitor. But the script lacks the substance to mine that personal drama. Wisely then Pitt chooses to mute his own performance and wherever possible head straight for the laughs - like the scene where hes the wily horse-trader hoodwinking his fellow GMs out of their lucrative assets. Still even Beane is obliged to admit ""Its hard not to be romantic about baseball."" Its just as hard not to be romantic about baseball movies. In that sense Moneyball is exactly like moneyball - infused with intelligence amusing in its attacks on false gods but way easier to admire than to love.

Last September it released ""The Social Network"" a story that took a dry numbers-oriented subject filtered it through a script by Aaron Sorkin added wistful music -- and picked up Oscar buzz and in the end some critics prizes. This September it is releasing ""Moneyball"" a story that takes a dry numbers-oriented subject filters it through a script co-written by Aaron Sorkin adds wistful music -- and clearly hopes to pick up some Oscar buzz and eventual prizes. Once again the result is a well-written sharply acted film thats guaranteed to garner attention. But this time the project doesnt have director David Fincher or quite so clear and emotional a theme. And thats the difference between the good movie that ""Moneyball"" is and the great one it could have been. Based on the nonfiction book (and originally slated to be directed by Steven Soderbergh) its the story of last decades Oakland As a team so woefully low-budget they couldnt afford the games top players. So general manager Billy Beane decided if we cant compete with the big boys we wont. Well play another kind of baseball -- one driven not by payrolls but by algorithms. It would be management by mathematics in which the new no-star team might not look like it had the right stuff -- but in the end would have the right stats to win. Director Bennett Miller has a strong star in Brad Pitt as the charismatic Beane and hes prevailed upon the chameleonlike Philip Seymour Hoffman -- who last did ""Capote"" for him -- to play a tough coach. The script (which was co-written by Steve Zaillian) often crackles. Yet the story is a literally ""inside baseball"" one that needs something -- a breathtaking style a huge emotional theme -- to move beyond box scores and the satisfying but unsurprising tale of one teams comeback. And it doesnt quite pull that off. Fincher made the data dance but Miller never manages to make the algorithms look like anything other than numbers. And while last time Sorkin found an emotional albeit debatable hook -- the antisocial kid as social-media genius -- whats the point being made here? Beanes giving out second chances true but hes only interested in the team not its players. (When one man does stammer out a thank you an even-more-embarrassed Beane brushes him off.) And in the end Beanes great breakthrough -- the triumph of the head over the heart facts over feeling -- is an odd thing for any artist to want to celebrate. There are some terrific scenes here (including one in which Beane juggling two phones and a handful of conflicting offers manages to put together a great trade). And if ""Tree of Life"" was Brad Pitt the actor this film has Brad Pitt the movie star -- easy assured charismatic. But I suspect the biggest baseball fans would rather see a real game. And the biggest movie fans might rather see just a little more real drama. Ratings note The film contains strong language. Moneyball (PG-13) Columbia (133 min.) Directed by Bennett Miller. With Brad Pitt Jonah Hill. Now playing in New Jersey.

Starring Brad Pitt Jonah Hill Philip Seymour Hoffman and Royce Clayton. Directed by Bennett Miller. (PG-13. 133 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Moneyball"" the movie is the greatest argument yet for fantasy baseball managers who are convinced they can run the Oakland As. With its pro-statistics themes and backroom-deal plot turns the film provides a well-scripted insider look at baseball. Among other revelations Giants General Manager Brian Sabean is an easy mark baseball scouts use the ""ugly girlfriend factor"" in their player reports and the inside of the Oakland Coliseum actually looks worse than the parts that fans can see. But the big-screen adaptation of Michael Lewis engaging 2003 book is also filled with compromises. Someone crammed ""Major League""-style sports cliches into a more nuanced story about baseball and progress - and then tried to fit a Brad Pitt star vehicle inside of that. The result is an interesting but frustrating near-miss. Pitt stars as As general manager Billy Beane in a movie that uses a surprising number of real names. (The most surreal bit of casting Former Giants shortstop Royce Clayton plays former As shortstop Miguel Tejada.) Faced with a low payroll budget Beane decides to rewrite the rules of baseball eventually recruiting an Ivy League economics major (Jonah Hill) who uses statistical Sabermetrics instead of scouting and intuition to craft a team. An early losing streak tests their faith before their ""island of misfit toys"" ballclub has a chance to make history. Related Stories Moneyball swings at fences and misses Review Moneyball ""Moneyball"" sort of strikes out Chronology and context are mucked with liberally. This happens in almost every sports movie based on real events although As fans will be blown away that Tim Hudson Barry Zito and Mark Mulder and their combined 57 wins in 2002 are scrubbed from existence here. Of the three only Hudson gets a cameo and he blows his start. Instead we spend a lot of time with Scott Hatte-berg David Justice and pitcher Chad Bradford bargain-basement players who helped the As excel. The contributions of Bradford in particular are elevated considerably. He was a good middle reliever who pitched 75 innings in 2002. In ""Moneyball"" hes framed as a ""Major League""/Ricky Vaughn team savior. ""Moneyball"" is too long - what do the Sabermetrics people say about 133-minute running times? - and yet much appears to be cut out. Robin Wright as Beanes ex-wife gets high billing then shows up in one scene. The actress who played Beanes second wife appears to have been removed altogether. The screenplay by Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian is the standout here. The first 25 minutes masquerade as a great movie piling on the wonky-cool details that made ""The West Wing"" seem good even when it wasnt. Mad scientist Beane wears a tracksuit bottom in one scene and the top shows up a couple of days later. He lectures his daughter not to read the papers or listen to sports radio. Much like the Sorkin-scripted ""The Social Network"" this film appeals to our curiosity. Sports fans in particular will enjoy the minutiae surrounding player deals and the antagonistic relationship between Beane and former As manager Art Howe who is portrayed with loping cluelessness by Philip Seymour Hoffman. Pitt opens a window into Beanes psyche with a mannerism-heavy performance. Bay Area moviegoers will appreciate the local touches including broadcasting warhorse Greg Papa playing himself and guitar wizard Joe Satriani performing the national anthem. But the grittier details in the script dont fit with the filmmakers insistence on cliched plot turns. The 2002 As story is arguably more of a moral victory than an actual one but the narrative squeezes in a moment straight from ""The Natural"" anyway. Baseball fans who follow the game closely will question whether the team and its forward-thinking executives have accomplished all that this movie suggests they did. Naysayers have been claiming for years that the ""Moneyball"" book wouldnt work as a movie. But ultimately its the cinematic touches that keep this film version from becoming something exceptional.

Starring Brad Pitt Jonah Hill Robin Wright Philip Seymour Hoffman Chris Pratt Kathryn Morris Tammy Blanchard Erin Pickett Sergio Garcia Stephen Bishop Director Bennett Miller Running time 206 Release Opened Sep 23 2011  Editorial Review Odd couple pitch a perfect gameBy Ann HornadayFriday Sep 23 2011Like a cold beer under a bluebird sky; like a flawless line drive on a warm summers day; like a long languorous seventh-inning stretch - ""Moneyball"" satisfies. A sports-centric come-from-behind drama that harbors profound truths under its self-effacing grin of an exterior ""Moneyball"" is a movie of such loping unforced ease and solid entertainment value that its easy to take its gifts for granted. After all who couldnt make a terrific film out of a book by master narrative journalist Michael Lewis adapted by gold-standard screenwriters Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin? Who couldnt go wrong with a protagonist played by go-to golden boy Brad Pitt and a nerdy comic foil played by Jonah Hill? What kind of idiot could blow one of American sports great come-from-behind moral victories - set within the dreamy fields of baseball so redolent of all-American values and an idealized bucolic past? The answer of course is a filmmaker who would dare to fatten such good bones with unnecessary melodrama or arty flourishes. Luckily ""Moneyball"" - which was briefly under the directorial hand of Steven Soderbergh - landed with another consummate pro Bennett Miller who proved so adroit in bringing Truman Capotes story to the screen in 2005s ""Capote."" Here Miller barely puts a foot wrong in bringing to life the tale of Oakland As general manager Billy Beane who in 2002 - competing against teams with three times his payroll - sought to rebuild the slumping As and revolutionize baseball recruiting using ""Sabermetrics"" a system by which players are chosen based on who gets on base most often. That approach sounds so simple as to be self-evident. But in ""Moneyball"" such logic runs afoul of Beanes old-school scouts who are played in the movie by a colorfully grizzled collection of character actors and some real-life baseball veterans. Their banter in which they refer to players jaw lines and girlfriends while they decide whom to hire lends ""Moneyball"" a thoroughly enjoyable through-line of tough vernacular wit. Whats more that plain-spoken charm couches a far deeper conceptual point that objective truth not only exists but matters even at a time when its continually being trumped by superstition ""feelings"" and irrational belief. But seeing that subtext is purely optional in a film that centers first and foremost on a gaggle of appealingly flawed protagonists chief among them the beer-guzzling Twinkie-gobbling Beane himself. Miller has done a superb job of underplaying Pitts native magnetism which nonetheless peeks out enough to dazzle Yale-educated computer whiz Peter Brand (Hill playing a character based on the real-life Paul DePodesta). When Beane summarily hires Brand away from the Cleveland Indians the sequence plays like a teasing tantalizing seduction; in time the two settle into a joshing giddily off-kilter dynamic with Brand gazing with shy wonderment as Beane populates his ""island of misfit toys."" (Philip Seymour Hoffman his head shaved and in full harumph mode is perfectly cast as As field manager Art Howe who isnt buying any of it.) As for that ragtag team Miller has assembled them mostly from major- and minor-league players who infuse their characters with a combination of verisimilitude and unaffected charisma. Brand and Beane bring on a pitcher who throws funny (Chad Bradford played by Casey Bond) an injured catcher (Scott Hatteberg played by Chris Pratt) and David Justice (Stephen Bishop) the superannuated former All-Star who earns the nickname ""Old Man Justice."" The secret of ""Moneyball"" isnt just that it makes viewers root for Beane and Brand - a classic cinematic odd couple - but for their motley crew of castoffs whose perpetually dumbstruck expressions suggest quiet shock that anyone would notice their flawed but genuine potential. (They take the news that theyve been traded or sent down like obedient hound dogs being called off a hunt.) Like last years ""The Social Network"" also written by Sorkin ""Moneyball"" infuses improbable emotion into what is essentially a number-crunching analytical endeavor; to paraphrase Sorkin himself ""Moneyball"" is no more about statistics and algorithms than ""The Social Network"" was about coding. In this case rationalizing the game actually helped to humanize it opening it up to players whose quirks had made them easy to dismiss. Beane can relate Not only was he a would-be star who didnt live up to his potential but he now seeks to provide for his young daughter (the beguiling Kerris Dorsey) while his ex-wife and her new husband give her a hushed life of privilege in Malibu. As a cry of the heart for the losers left-behinds and let-go who still have something to offer ""Moneyball"" plays like a particularly heart-rending parable of these economic times. And with baseball season ready to wrap up it gives fans some terrific games to watch a miracle of a winning streak to cheer (at least vicariously) and a rumpled humane hero to root for. Its difficult to review ""Moneyball"" without using the term ""home run."" So lets just say that it rounds all the bases with grace modesty and a surfeit of heart. Contains some strong profanity.

Photo Columbia Pictures/courtesy Ever Philip Seymour Hoffman plays Oakland manager Art Howe. (Columbia Pictures/courtesy Ever) No jock schmaltzfest like ""Field of Dreams"" the whip-smart ""Moneyball"" is a crowd-pleasing baseball movie for people -- like me -- who dont like baseball movies. Thanks to sterling work by the odd-couple team of Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill and a razor-sharp script by Oscar winners Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network"") and Steve Zaillian (""Schindlers List"") -- as well as understated direction by Bennett Miller -- this is probably the finest baseball movie since ""Bull Durham"" back in 1988. That was another film where the intensely boring-to-watch sport was largely benched in favor of sharp dialogue and well-drawn characters. Looking more and more like his mentor Robert Redford in middle age Pitt knocks it out of the park. Hes wonderful as the superstitious Billy Beane (he refuses to watch his teams games) who reinvents the hidebound sport in the early part of the 21st century in league with a young statistician out of Harvard Business School. Beane worked his way up the scouting ranks to general manager of the Oakland Athletics after flaming out as a player for the Mets who signed him out of high school. As the film opens Beane watches as his team loses to the Yankees in the 2001 playoffs. Worse the well-heeled Yanks have the money to lure away Beanes three free-agent star players from the Athletics a relative shoestring operation. In this compelling adaptation of Michael Lewis ""Moneyball The Art of Winning an Unfair Game"" Hills number-crunching statistician Peter Brand (a fictionalized version of the real-life Paul DePodesta now assistant general manager of the Mets) uses numbers to show Pitt how he can build a winning team for a relative pittance by employing a controversial system called sabermetrics. By focusing on on-base percentages rather than gold-standard batting averages Beane and Brand sign up misfits injured players and aging stars -- such as former star David Justice (Steven Bishop) acquired from the Yankees at a steep discount -- who have enough juice in them to propel them into the playoff again. (Although the Justice trade didnt exactly happen that way its one of several instances of acceptable dramatic license.) This radical approach to the game is derided by Beanes aging tradition-oriented scouting staff -- Ken Medlock is especially memorable as the most vociferous of these dinosaurs. They cant stop Beane but he hits a major roadblock with his surly manager Art Howe -- wonderfully played by Philip Seymour Hoffman (who Bennett directed to a Best Actor Oscar in Bennetts only other film ""Capote"") in a few strategic scenes. Howe flat-out refuses to use their most unorthodox acquisition Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) a first baseman who literally could not throw a baseball because of an injury. Beane finally gets his way through a labyrinthine series of deals -- the films best sequence and a great example of how a good director and screenwriters can throw a lot of information at the audience and make it stick (as Sorkin did in ""The Social Network""). While there are glimpses of Beanes minimal private life -- he has a daughter (Kathryn Morris) and an ex-wife (cameo-ing Robin Wright) -- most of the movie takes place in locker rooms where Beane and Brand plot together on an unlikely scheme that ultimately resulted a record 20-game winning streak. Pitt and a slimmed-down Hill (very effective in his first non-comic role) have terrific chemistry together. Its a triumphal save for Bennett who was called in as a relief director after Steven Soderbergh left before shooting started because of creative differences. ""Moneyball"" brilliantly proves the old maxim that its not whether you win or lose its how you play the game. In this case though the game isnt necessarily baseball. lou.lumenicknypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next New Dragon Tattoo trailer revealed Read Next New Dragon Tattoo trailer revealed Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 38634 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 20496 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 20190 16 feared dead in Texas hot air balloon crash Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

Brad Pitt in Moneyball Bennett Millers Moneyball (Columbia Pictures) adapted by Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian from the nonfiction book by Michael Lewis is a sports movie for people who dont like sports movies. I know this is true because I enjoyed it. Many classic films about sport hinge on a climactic zero-sum contest--the ""big game""--that leaves this viewer as indifferent as real-life big games do. This is in no way meant as a slight against the dazzlingly gifted athletes who play pro sports or the fine people who follow them. (Theres one on my couch right now watching the Phillies.) But secretly Im always thinking well one side or the other has to win and then the game and/or movie will be over right? Cant you just get back to me with the score? Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. The sports movies I come away remembering--Breaking Away Eight Men Out North Dallas Forty--are about things that happen on the periphery of the big game intrigue romance betrayal or in the case of Moneyball back-room horse-trading. This low-key unassuming yet curiously satisfying movie invites us into the seldom-visited world of the general manager the guy whose job it is to know who to recruit who to trade and who to cut from the team. A few key scenes take place on the baseball diamond but the real playing field here is the cluttered desk of Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) the GM of the Oakland Athletics. In October 2001 Billy a once-promising player who went into management after his career sputtered out has just watched the As lose their shot at the World Series then has three star players sign as free agents to richer teams.  Sitting around with his crusty team of talent scouts Billy mocks their often imprecise criteria for spotting talent Is the player in question good-looking enough to attract local fans? Does he have an ugly girlfriend--a possible sign theorizes one old-timer of low self-esteem? But Billy working with a limited budget doesnt have any better system to offer--until at a meeting with the Cleveland Indians management he runs into Peter Brand (Jonah Hill).  Pete is a young socially inept Yale economics grad whos developed a wonky spreadsheet system for predicting a teams success over time. Beane poaches Brand from the Indians and brings him on board as his assistant to the chagrin of the As old-school manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman). To the amusement of the baseball establishment Peter and Billy develop an unorthodox but cost-effective approach to creating a lineup. They cobble together a Frankenstein of a team in which a players on-base percentage counts for more than his batting average figuring that a mediocre player who consistently hits singles is worth more than an unreliable superstar. They acquire a catcher Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) whose throwing arm is shot promising hell get on-the-job training at first base. (Asked by a fellow player what scares him about his new position Hatteberg replies with dead seriousness ""A ball being hit in my general direction."") Advertisement Like another recent film Steven Soderberghs Contagion Moneyball manages to invest its characters sessions at the whiteboard or computer screen with more drama than you might expect. Its not necessary to know exactly how Billy and Peters number-crunching system works in order to grasp that these are two men enthralled with the possibility of building a great ball club and if they get lucky changing the way a great team is built. Moneyball is a buddy comedy crossed with an office drama At its heart is the relationship between the laconic but hot-tempered Billy and the timid but brillliant Peter. As Billy Beane Pitt gets to dip tobacco engage in manly backroom banter (""If hes a good hitter why dont he hit good?"") and hurl the occasional locker-room water cooler to the floor with rage. But Billy is also a fragile angsty sort who is too invested in his beloved team to actually watch their games--he listens on the radio from his car or has the results texted to him while he works out. Pitt himself is at the top of his game using his leonine good looks to his advantage in building a complex character As he wanders the clubhouse in sweats munching on fast food you can see both the stubbornly proud GM and the disappointed ex-player within. Jonah Hill who was wearing out his welcome as a loudmouth comic actor completely renews his visa in this straight dramatic role (which also gives him the chance to be funny not by wisecracking broadly but by underreacting). One of the films chief pleasures is in watching Hills initially bumbling young nerd slowly acquire the courage of his convictions. A late scene in which Billy and Peter jointly negotiate a sneaky trade playing two rival teams off each other in a series of overlapping phone calls moves forward with propulsive screwball velocity with Hills triumphal fist pump serving as a laugh line in itself. A plot thread in which Peter first resists then reluctantly accepts the grim task of telling players theyve been traded will resonate with any middle manager whos had to wield an axe on their bosss behalf. A back story about Billys ex-wife (Robin Wright) and 12-year-old daughter (Kerris Dorsey) doesnt accomplish as much as it should though Pitts scenes with Dorsey are worth it for the young actresss button-cute face and distinctive voice. And a series of flashbacks to Billys youth featuring an actor (Reed Thompson) who looks uncannily like the young Brad Pitt leaves us a little too much in the dark as to what happened to Billys career--did he have a fatal character flaw of some kind or was he just not a good enough ballplayer? Cinematographer Wally Pfisters deliberately unglamorous presentation of the As dilapidated clubhouse is a long way from the gold-and-sepia tones of Barry Levinsons The Natural. ""You cant help but be romantic about baseball"" Billy observes to Peter even as hes being reviled by his own organization for his supposedly bloodless reliance on the stats. Its to the directors credit and Pitts that Moneyball is anything but bloodless--in its own quiet unspectacular way this movie courses with life. Corrections Sept. 23 2011 This article originally stated that the As star players were traded to other teams when in fact they signed to other teams as free agents.(Return to the corrected sentence.) This article also incorrectly implied that the As ranked near the bottom of the league in wins. In fact they had just come off a season when the team won 102 games.(Return to the corrected sentence.)

The core of Michael Lewis best-seller was occupied by men playing with numbers -- stretching dollars obsessing over statistics trying to squeeze blood from the stone what was the penny-pinching Oakland As of the early 2000s. Theres no love story. Theres no fight scene. There isnt even much baseball.Which makes the success of Moneyball the movie all the more striking. Writers Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin and director Bennett Miller have chiseled a very human narrative out of an imposing granite wall. It helps a little if you like baseball (and a little more if like me youve been an As fan). But an appreciation for culture clashes and for those that thumb their noses at the way things are supposed to be done will do just fine.Of course it never hurts to have a movie star operating at peak performance. Pitt plays As general manager Billy Beane with a comfortable strut and a chip on his shoulder. His breezy exterior masks a guy who isnt always great with other people. Hes pretty sure hes the smartest guy in the room and the movie finds its chief pleasure in proving him right.Sorkin and Miller share the most fruitful partnership here. Sorkin the zingy dialogue master who won an Oscar for The Social Network brings comic timing to the spectacle of old-school baseball scouts (including former Rangers assistant general manager Grady Fuson played by Ken Medlock) butting heads with laptop-wielding new jacks (led by Beane and his Ivy League-educated assistant played by Jonah Hill in a promising semi-dramatic turn). Brent Jennings also has some nice moments as current Texas Rangers manager Ron Washington then an As coach.Miller an Oscar nominee for Capote works in a lower register of tortured souls and muted disappointment. Hes a master of the economical image that says a ton When we see the giant banners of the As departing expensive stars falling from the Oakland Coliseum walls the enormity of Beanes task comes into focus.He also uses well-placed flashbacks to shine light on Beanes backstory. Identified out of high school as a five-tool player (hit hit for power run field throw) he doesnt have the emotional makeup to succeed in the big leagues. The scouts swung and missed with him which helps explain his apathy for scouting. Though Pitts Beane is far more charming than Jesse Eisenbergs Mark Zuckerberg and no one snorts cocaine off an interns ribcage the Social Network comparison works Both films tell articulate wonky stories about motivated men who need to be right.The efforts to make Beane a fully rounded character dont always work. His relationships with ex-wife (Robin Wright) and adolescent daughter (Kerris Dorsey) are a little undercooked though you could argue the peripheral role of those in Beanes life outside work speaks to the characters myopic drive. In any case even when the movie drifts a bit -- its a little too long at 133 minutes -- Pitt is there to steady the ship. Hes never seemed more at home in a role.MoneyballB+ Starring Brad Pitt Jonah Hill Robin Wright Phillip Seymour Hoffman Chris Pratt Stephen Bishop and Brent Jennings. Directed by Bennett Miller.

He upends old-school traditions and tosses aside romantic notions about the national pastime.Moneyball is a fascinating portrait of an iconoclast. Based on a true story as related in Michael Lewis 2003 book Moneyball The Art of Winning an Unfair Game this is a riveting tale of a man defying conventional wisdom -- and winning.STORY Pitt Hill put Moneyball in playWatch the trailerDirector Bennett Miller (Capote) and writers Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin make a potent trio. Pitt gives one of his most nuanced performances as the temperamental and enigmatic Beane.The supporting cast is strong as is the deft sharply witty script. Miller directs elegantly letting the narrative unfold at a deliberate artful pace. The film opens with the 2001 playoff series in which the Oakland As met the New York Yankees. The Yankees win aided by a payroll that was triple that of the smaller-market As is depicted as emblematic of the state of baseball today and its emphasis on huge salaries.About the movieMoneyball   1/2 out of fourStarsBrad Pitt Jonah Hill Philip Seymour Hoffman Robin Wright Chris Pratt Stephen BishopDirector Bennett Miller Distributor Sony Pictures Rating PG-13 for some strong language Running time 2 hours 13 minutes Opens Friday nationwideBeane a former player with vestiges of a jocks swagger appeals to the team owner for more money for the next season but he gets shut down. So he tries a non-conformist tack. On a tight budget he defies tradition in a game that is often bound to it.Aided by Yale grad Peter Brand and his computer-driven statistical analysis Beane lets the numbers be his guide. Eschewing the assessments hunches and prejudices of a cadre of veteran scouts Beane assembles a team of ""bargain"" players whose ability to get on base trumps all.Locking horns with field manager Art Howe (an almost unrecognizable crew-cut Philip Seymour Hoffman) Beane and his controversial methods result in a record-breaking 20-game winning streak.The film is about 15 minutes too long and shoehorns in a father-daughter subplot that doesnt fully jell. But it has a fair amount in common with 1988s Bull Durham-- minus the sex -- in its acerbic humor and memorable dialogue.Baseball fans know this story but Miller puts it all in fascinating context. This is a thinking persons baseball movie a more complex version of the inspirational sports story.Moneyball is as much about one man resisting groupthink as much as it is a classic underdog saga.

"Moneyball Review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Steven ZaillianMovie review MoneyballBrad Pitt stars as Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane in this surprise success with a story that goes beyond baseball.September 23 2011|By Kenneth Turan | Los Angeles Times Film Critic Oakland Athletics General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and Assistant... (Melinda Sue Gordon Columbia...)Winning isnt everything voracious Vince Lombardi used to say its the only thing. But what if Lombardi was wrong? What if other things mean more last longer have more significance than victories not only in life but also in the particular lives of the people who play the games? This is the heretical premise of the thoughtful and entertaining ""Moneyball"" based on the equally iconoclastic bestseller by Michael Lewis. Starring Brad Pitt in top movie star form its a film thats impressive and surprising. Its a surprise because ""Moneyball"" is that rare sports movie that doesnt end with a rousing last-second victory or a come-from-behind celebration. Fittingly for a book its author calls ""a biography of an idea"" it deals not only with wins and losses but also with the quixotic quest of a man who wanted to revolutionize a sport someone who was willing in Lewis words ""to rethink baseball how it is managed how it is played who is best suited to play it and why."" That man was Billy Beane charmingly played by Pitt the provocative general manager of the Oakland Athletics whose unconventional ideas about what a team with limited resources could do to compete with profligate powerhouses like the New York Yankees continue to infuriate the sports traditionalists. Its not for nothing that ""Moneyball"" starts with a quote from Yankees star Mickey Mantle ""Its unbelievable how much you dont know about the game youve been playing all your life."" ""Moneyball"" is also a surprise success because this has been a famously troubled production one on which Sony pulled the plug just before shooting was to begin despite having Steven Soderbergh set to direct from a script by Steven Zaillian. The project should have died right there but Pitt who must have had a sense of how good a role this was for him refused to let it go. With Aaron Sorkin aboard as co-writer and Bennett Miller shrewdly installed as director the film unexpectedly flourished. Miller whose only previous features are the subtle nuanced ""Capote"" and a documentary has a restrained but dead-on storytelling style that is an ideal counterpoint for a tale set in the emotional volatile world of professional sports. Hes a filmmaker who knows how to make stories involving without overstating them and like Billy Beane he sees value in situations others might miss. ""Capote"" won a lead actor Oscar for Philip Seymour Hoffman (who returns here letter-perfect as Oakland Manager Art Howe) and Millers focused style once again creates an atmosphere where actors can flourish. Chief among these is Pitt who does wonders with a role of a good guy in a tough space a man who combines the confidence and charisma of the former professional athlete Beane is with an unexpected questioning nature. This is low-key star power at its best. Pitt of course does not do it alone. Aside from Hoffman he has an ideal foil in an unexpectedly dramatic Jonah Hill who makes the perfect odd couple complement to Pitts Beane as the awkward pudgy Peter Brand a computer geek who studied economics at Yale but eats baseball statistics for breakfast and ends up as Oaklands assistant general manager. The actors and director Miller have the benefit of a strong script that feels seamless despite having had both Zaillian and Sorkin work on it. (Stan Chervin gets story credit.) Though it departs at times from the way things happened -- Brand is a fictional character because Oaklands real assistant general manager Paul DePodesta later with the Dodgers refused to allow his name to be used -- the screenplay has great pungent dialogue and a strong sense of drama that couldnt have been easy to distill from Lewis discursive book. ""Moneyball"" begins on Oct. 15 2001 with Beanes Oakland team in serious trouble Its losing the American League division series to the much wealthier Yankees. The As general manager gets more bad news when he meets with the team owner. Not only are the As relinquishing one of their top players to the Yankees via free agency but there is also no money to replace him. As Beane runs a meeting with his scouts and player development people (several of whom are played by real-life weathered baseball veterans) the general manager is a picture of frustration. Because the As are one of the sports poorer teams they cant buy their way out of trouble. ""We got to think differently"" Beane insists but just what would differently mean? Beane gets a hint when he meets young Brand then working for the Cleveland Indians who introduces the general manager to the world of sabermetrics a statistical analysis of baseball pioneered by Bill James. The notion is that traditional ways of looking at player value have led to individuals being misjudged to some players being overvalued and most important for the As to others being undervalued and thus available for poor but enlightened teams to purchase. ""Moneyball"" sets off this inside baseball stuff with segments about Beanes private life about his failed marriage (Robin Wright plays the ex-wife) and his tenuous relationship with his young daughter (a very fine Kerris Dorsey). Most critically the film takes us back to Beanes own odyssey as a professional player showing how the past was prologue to actions he takes in the here and now. Once Beane a nervy guy who believes in wheeling dealing and rolling the dice gets James system in his blood the great fun of ""Moneyball"" begins as we watch Beane and Brand assemble in classic ""Seven Samurai"" fashion a team of unwanted players. People like Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) a catcher whose overall baseball abilities Beane valued so much that he changed him into a first baseman because Hatteberg could no longer throw well enough to be behind the plate.

The church is desanctified in ""Moneyball"" whose context is runaway commerce and whose subtext is statistics--i.e. a scientific approach to the major-league version of the game that seeks to sweep away nostalgic notions and dry the moist eyes of the faithful. Never before though have statistics added up to such electrifying entertainment. After the mostly minor-league productions of recent months this movie which was directed by Bennett Miller renews your belief in the power of movies. ENLARGE Brad Pitt as the Oakland Athletics Billy Beane in Moneyball. Columbia Pictures Brad Pitt plays--to perfection--Billy Beane the current Oakland Athletics general manager who in 2002 guided his small-market underfunded team to an unprecedented 20 consecutive wins. (He was the subject of the Michael Lewis book from which the script an inventive work of fiction based on fact has been adapted by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin.) In that year as the film has it Billy finds salvation from the As relative poverty--relative most painfully to the filthy-rich Yankees--by putting into practice the theories of Bill James whod been preaching the gospel of so-called sabermetrics. Instead of paying lavish salaries to superstars who sometimes fail to produce needed wins the cash-strapped GM--himself an ex-player who didnt deliver on his shining promise--depends on intricately detailed computer analyses of individual performance. By doing so hes able to buy specific talents embodied by players who might otherwise be unwanted or ignored. His brainiac aide in this abstruse enterprise is his assistant general manager Peter Brand (Jonah Hill). A young Yale-educated economist with a picture of Plato on his bedroom wall Pete knows little about baseball but lots about teasing the meaning out of equations and algorithms. ""Using stats the way we read them"" he tells Billy ""well find value players that no one else can see."" Watch a clip of ""Moneyball"" starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill. Courtesy Columbia Pictures. Theres nothing abstruse about the way ""Moneyball"" dramatizes the enterprise. Thanks to the elegant understatement of Mr. Hills portrayal the unworldly Pete provides a wonderful foil to Mr. Pitts eccentric flamboyant Billy in just about every scene they share. But just about every scene in the film crackles with intelligence brittle humor and edgy conflict; its not to minimize Mr. Zaillians gifts or those of the director to say that the dialogues pace and density evoke Mr. Sorkins screenplay for ""The Social Network."" Movie moments dont get much better than the staff meetings in which Billy takes on the panel of supposedly wise old executives and scouts who pick players for the As to hire (every one of them is wittily delineated) or the machine-gun-rapid succession of phone calls in which Billy negotiates with other teams for players he wants to buy. (The calls come too fast to follow in detail but theyre hugely enjoyable all the same.) Or Billys first encounter with Pete during a negotiating session with the top management of the Cleveland Indians. A relentlessly acute observer Billy senses that Pete an extremely junior member of the Indians staff is playing an almost silent but extremely important role. Confronting him later in a hallway Billy asks ""Who are you? What happened in that room?"" From top to bottom the casting is inspired. Mr. Pitt couples a star presence--theres a singular there there whenever the As general manager is in camera range--to a beautifully measured ensemble performance that makes Billy a minimalist ironist tossing off funny remarks with an abandon that almost conceals his deep anger pain or self-doubt. ""Good meeting"" he says brightly after a horrible meeting with his stern-faced field manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) an implacable foe of anything that smacks of sabermetrics ""Every time we talk Im reinvigorated by your love of the game."" More Baseball After Moneyball The Moneyball Myth Arts character is written rather repetitively--hes implacable and implacable and then implacable--but Mr. Hoffman as ever gives his man a special if ever-glowering cachet. Robin Wright does a brief graceful turn in the role of Billys estranged wife. Chris Pratt is affecting as Scott Hatteberg the washed-up catcher recycled by Billy according to sabermetric precepts into a valuable first-baseman. Billys daughter Casey is played by Kerris Dorsey a young actress in her feature debut whos the essence of sweet simplicity in a couple of crucial scenes. One of them is set in a music shop where Casey to her fathers boundless delight works out chords on a guitar and sings ever so tentatively. All you need know about the other with Casey behind the wheel of a car is that it serves to the films immense benefit as her exquisite loving postscript to the complex subject of her dad. The force that binds all of this fine work is fine direction. Whether Mr. Miller is dealing with the professional actors in his cast or with real-life baseball players standing in for the players and scouts of the Oakland As his touch is unerring and his narrative vision is clear. After only one documentary (""The Cruise"") and one feature (""Capote"" with Mr. Hoffman in the title role) he now takes his place in the first rank of American directors. The cinematographer Wally Pfister has already demonstrated his mastery in a string of Christopher Nolan films and won an Oscar for ""Inception""; this time he works stylishly but unobtrusively and that includes what may amount to an accidental sight gag when someone almost blocks the camera in the process of whispering in someone elses ear. ENLARGE Jonah Hill as Beanes assistant in Moneyball Columbia Pictures ""Moneyball"" was inspired as the familiar phrase goes by a true story. In fact Peter Brand is a dramatic invention and a very good one. In fact Billy Beane was not the first general manager to bring a statistical approach to the Oakland As; he continued the work begun by Sandy Alderson who gets credit in the book but doesnt figure in the film. One might also debate as my sportswriter colleague Allen Barra did in a separate Journal piece Thursday the factual accuracy of the book which may--or may not--have overstated the sabermetric case. As a work of fiction the film suffers from an energy sag toward the end by remaining admirably faithful to the odd nature of its source material. Because the Oakland As didnt get a World Series win in 2002 and because Billy Beanes life has never been blessed by the sort of conventional triumph that makes for great movie endings the films narrative pauses not once but twice while others remind the hero--and the audience--that he really did change major-league baseball and that he really does deserve to think well of himself. On the whole though the film gets many important things exactly right. It isnt about numbers be they player stats or the staggering sums spent by top-tier franchises even though the story seems at first to be asking us to root for the gimlet-eyed statistician rather than the sharp-eyed pitcher or batter; for data rather than intuition; for the cool satisfactions of science rather than the fevered romance of sport. What its really about is the old-fashioned heroism of a traditional hero in a fresh guise--a flawed guy with little to show for his 40-odd years; a smart guy who finds a way to make his smarts matter. ""Moneyball"" is a new manifestation of the old Yankee spirit though hardly in the Steinbrenner sense--a deeply American film about a uniquely American sport in which a principled guy takes on the moneyed titans because he cant stand the unfairness of what theyre doing to the game he still loves. Watch a clip of ""Machine Gun Preacher"" starring Gerard Butler. Courtesy Relativity Media. Machine Gun Preacher Sometimes the phrase ""based on a true story"" signals a failure of imagination. Thats the case in ""Machine Gun Preacher"" a would-be inspirational account of Sam Childers a drug-dealing biker thug who transformed by religious faith became a lay preacher in Pennsylvania and founded an organization to rescue children from the ravages of internecine warfare in East Africa. ENLARGE Gerard Butler as the titular Sam Childers in Machine Gun Preacher. Relativity Media The failure lies not with the films director Marc Forster nor with its impressive star Gerard Butler but with Jason Kellers dreadfully earnest script which charts the heros spiritual journey and his Rambo-esque exploits without offering a scintilla of mature perspective on his state of mind. Is Sam a saint or is he a zealot who ends up killing child soldiers on his own? Has he turned his native intelligence from a life of crime to a life of service or has he been driven mad by the suffering he finds after a casual first visit to embattled Sudan? No reason that it cant be any or all of the above but the films dramatic opacity can be maddening too. DVD FOCUS The Tree of Life (2011) ENLARGE The theatrical window grows ever narrower. On Oct. 11th Terrence Malicks exquisite and exasperating film will be available on DVD and Blu-ray (the latter format being preferable given the grandeur as well as the gorgeous simplicity of Emmanuel Lubezkis cinematography). Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain are a father and mother known only as Mr. and Mrs. OBrien in the 1950s Texas of the filmmakers youth. Mr. Pitt gives equal weight to his characters tyranny and thwarted dreams. Ms. Chastain has few words and doesnt need them to portray a woman struggling to preserve faith in the face of incomprehensible tragedy. Cyrus (2010) Jonah Hill is one side of a triangle in this dulcetly crazy and certifiably hilarious little comedy made by the Duplass brothers Jay and Mark. John C. Reilly is John still a lost soul seven years after his divorce. Marisa Tomei is Molly who comes out of nowhere at a party he has forced himself to attend. She is everything John could have wished for--smart kind pretty and a sex angel in the bargain. The only complication is her tangled relationship with Mr. Hills Cyrus her 21-year-old son who lives at home and is to say the least seriously weird. The Savages (2007) Philip Seymour Hoffman is Jon Savage a lovelorn professor of drama in Buffalo N.Y. Laura Linney is Wendy Savage Jons sister a would-be playwright in Manhattan The catalyst of Tamara Jenkinss charmingly distinctive comedy is Lenny Savage a nasty old reprobate played with pitiless brio by Philip Bosco. By hurtling headlong into dementia Lenny forces his children to take stock of their lives. At every step of the way Ms. Jenkins puts her people through changes as fascinating in their free-form fashion as the lava lamp that holds Lenny in befuddled thrall.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""How can you not be romantic about baseball?"" says Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane in ""Moneyball."" Its a question tinged with sarcasm. Beane (a slyly intelligent Brad Pitt) never watches his team play catching snatches of the game on TV or radio. Insulating himself from the emotional swings of headfirst dives into home plate and heartbreak strikeouts Beane learned to see baseball analytically. He challenged the tradition-bound sport rejecting magical thinking about lucky streaks jinxes weird rituals and overpaid superstars. His data-driven approach took the game out of the realm of voodoo and into predictive data mining. Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a naive Yale economics nerd with an eye for underpriced talent helps Beane draft young inexpensive players and unwanted affordable veterans with high on-base percentages. With a team of ""misfit toys"" they transform the small-market As into a juggernaut. The film marbles together the Athletics record-breaking 2002 season with flashbacks to Billys failure-haunted past including a failed marriage. Director Bennett Miller (""Capote"") and screenwriters Steve Zaillian (""Schindlers List"") and Aaron Sorkin (TVs ""The West Wing"") nimbly sidestep every cliche along the way looking at the game of baseball through the prism of stats and business. Just as Beane changes the game this film creates a new formula for the sports movie. A scene with Pitt and Hill in sublime comic harmony as they coordinate rapid-fire player trades while juggling phones is as exhilarating as a triple play. ""Moneyball"" was adapted from Michael Lewis nonfiction bestseller by some of the talented team that gave us last years ""The Social Network."" It has a similar focus on a misunderstood blunt-spoken visionary and a similar air of cool perceptive brainpower. Its not really a sports movie at all but a tale of outsiders who defy conventional thinking and the institutions that fight them every step of the way (personified by prickly Philip Seymour Hoffman as the Athletics headstrong manager.) Columbia Pictures Melinda Sue Gordon Brad Pitt stars in ""Moneyball."" There are plenty of colorful old-school guys hanging around the As clubhouse and theyre responsible for many of the films laugh-out-loud moments. One veteran scout nixes a prospective player because ""he has an ugly girlfriend"" and therefore no self-confidence -- a wonderfully flawed and subjective pronouncement. Those old shamans are about to be shaken up by Beanes new computerized-evidence-beats-intuition vision of the game. Though not as shocked as the deep-pocketed New York Yankees overrun by the team with the smallest player payroll in the league. Pitts Beane is as original a character as Ive seen in a baseball drama. Hes a driven disappointed athlete his youthful dreams of World Series glory crushed but still smoldering. He passed up a full scholarship at Stanford in favor of a big-money outfielders position for the New York Mets (and later the Minnesota Twins). He never became the top player the recruiters anticipated. He never even learned to give those stirring locker-room speeches that are sports movie staples; his big pep talk is five seconds of silence.

But in real baseball the man with the most information wins a ring.""Moneyball"" based on a best-seller by Michael Lewis makes baseball statistics accessible even sexy. Thats a credit to star Brad Pitt to smart screenwriters Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian and to fleet-footed director Bennett Miller. Although you dont have to be a sports fan to enjoy it ""Moneyball"" is one of the best baseball movies imaginable.Lack of imagination is hindering the Oakland Athletics as management picks up the pieces from another failed season. General manager Billy Beane (Pitt) realizes he cant afford to sign the star players who are defecting to large-market teams like the New York Yankees so he challenges his scouts to think differently for 2002. When they regurgitate baseball bromides about sluggers and strikeouts Beane hires a contrarian as his assistant. Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) is a meek young Yale economics graduate who applies a new statistical analysis that values on-base percentage over glamour stats such as home runs and batting average. In Brands calculations obscure underpaid players like backup catcher Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) are more valuable than a million-dollar player like Jeremy Giambi (who is traded for versatile ex-Cardinal John Mabry).Old-school manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) refuses to play the defensively challenged Hatteberg at first base so Beane trades rising star Carlos Pena.""I can do this all day"" says the equally stubborn Beane. Under Beane and Brands system the lowly As win a record-tying 20 games in a row and make it to the playoffs. Yet baseball buffs already know that the ending doesnt fit into Hollywood or Cooperstown traditions.Although its ostensibly a sports movie ""Moneyball"" is less about on-field conflict than an off-field character. Beane a divorced father and former player who never lived up to his potential rarely watches the games but he pours his competitive zeal into trade negotiations.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Comment Reprints Follow TIME An actor-producer nurturing a dream project needs some of the people skills and the ruthlessness of a major-league general manager. Brad Pitt had resolved to make a movie of Moneyball Michael Lewiss ""nonfiction"" best-seller about Oakland As GM Billy Beane during the teams 2002 season and achieved it with numerous personnel changes. As Beane had traded players and ditched scouts so did Pitt run through at least three writers -- Stan Chervin (story) plus Oscar-winning scribes Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin -- and three directors David Frankel of The Devil Wears Prada and Marley amp; Me then Oceans helmer Steven Soderbergh and finally Capotes Bennett Miller. Yet the film doesnt play like the minutes of a fractious board meeting; it turns out to be smart funny and seemingly seamless. That surely is as much a tribute to the stars administrative strategies as to his on-screen charisma. A solid bustling social comedy at the 130-IQ level Moneyball boasts the zinging stinging repartee of grown men working at a kids game and tired of being handed the prevailing line of bull. Most impatient is Beane a former teen phenom who was all high-school promise no big-league delivery. Decades later as the As GM he built playoff teams on a fraction of the payroll of the Yankees colossus. But in early 2002 he had lost three top players to richer teams and would get no help from his chintzy owner. ""The problem"" he tells his scouting staff ""is that there are the rich teams and the poor teams and then theres 50 feet of crap and then theres us."" Beane has little talent to use as trade bait and few minor-league prospects. He cant win the old way. So hell try another method what Lewis called ""moneyball."" (See Richard Corlisss thrilling but soul-sapping relationship with the Oakland As.) In a confab with the Cleveland Indians Beane notices a young stats cruncher named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill in an owlish watchful turn). An economics major from Yale with no sports background Brand is ready to put the sabermetric logarithms of baseball theoretician Bill James into practice and Beane hires him. Jamess model is anathema to the As scouts parchment-skinned geezers who consider themselves the Supreme Court of baseball wisdom muttering mantras like ""five tools"" and ""good face"" as if they were the Bill of Rights. Beane curt warning to them ""Adapt or die."" He also orders his field manager Art Howe (a wearily agitated Philip Seymour Hoffman) to man first base with a kid who draws plenty of walks but has never played the position. Apparently fearful of an all-talking picture Miller adds shots of Billy driving at night smashing things and working out in the team gym. And presumably for the ladies the movie offers a subplot of Beanes ex-wife (Robin Wright) and early-teens daughter (Kerris Dorsey) that has its sweet spots but whose main function is to pad a 90-minute movie with an additional half-hour of domestic angst and uplift. Theres also a long section in which the As flirt with a record 20 consecutive wins -- something the real Billy Beane would remind you is sabermetrically irrelevant as long as you pile up enough Ws by seasons end. (Read Corliss on baseballs Bill James whose ideas inspired Moneyball.) The central pairing though has championship stuff Beane a jock with a restless intelligence going on a bold adventure with Brand a sedentary soul whose computer brain pinwheels stats that Beane can turn into wins. Its as if the Winklevoss twins of The Social Network -- another script with the high-octane-motormouth Sorkin touch -- had found a way to work with Mark Zuckerberg. When these two start brainstorming Moneyball cruises into the high gear of the savviest old Hollywood comedies. Moneyball bears another similarity to The Social Network its largely fictional. ""Peter Brand"" is in reality Paul DePodesta who while getting his economics degree at Harvard played baseball and football -- unlike the fat doughy Hill who looks as if hed be exhausted by a game of Go Fish and who in the movie fans in his one attempt at a high-five slap. DePodesta later GM for the Dodgers and now the Mets head of player development told Yahoo Sports Tim Brown ""Im not particularly fond of the caricature particularly since its not me. I never was that guy before the book came out and Im not that guy now."" DePodesta asked that his characters name be changed and it was. (Read Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher talk about making The Social Network.) Baseball fans can debate such verses of the Beane gospel as ""a walk is as good as a hit."" (Well not always If theres a man on second base a walk to the next batter doesnt advance him whereas a single to the outfield could drive him in.) But whats crucial is that Beanes team didnt shine at what he preached working out walks getting on base knockin em home. In their Moneyball year the As were 9th in on-base percentage 10th in RBIs 4th in walks; in all these categories the Yankees and Red Sox were first or second. No the reason the As managed four consecutive post-season runs from 2000 to 2003 was their trio of phenomenal young pitchers who are almost completely ignored in the Moneyball movie Tim Hudson Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. In 2001 they Ted Lilly and Corey Lidle became the first starting five in decades who each had an ERA below 4.00. Even more startling that same year the Golden Threes combined salary was less than 1 million. Now that in an era of 100-million teams is the makings of a minor miracle. But probably not the makings of a mass-market movie or a vehicle for Brad Pitt. And he does sensational work. At ease in Beanes skin he exudes pure movie-star authority by walking into a room juggling phone calls from rivals GMs playing Svengali or Caligula or your understanding dad. Earlier this year Pitt was brilliant as the martinet father in Terrence Malicks The Tree of Life -- a man who was as desperate to be a good parent as he was incapable of pulling it off. Here hes equally fine playing the charismatic dude who says ""I hate to lose even more than I want to win"" and who uses that prideful threat as a spur to his teams success. His performance is a canny portrait of leadership -- part genius part crazy guts part dumb luck -- and worthy of moving Pitt up to the playoff round of Oscar finalists for Best Actor.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + In the annals of baseball movies ""Moneyball is a weird one - a Zen comedy set in the front office. Even the story line sounds unsexy In 2002 amid much opposition Oakland As general manager Billy Beane revives his sorry little ball club by using statistical analysis to hire undervalued players - freaks and losers who nevertheless manage to get on base. Slugging percentages and mid-season trades are the stuff of this movies drama. Wheres the 3-2 pitch in the ninth bases loaded and the kids in the bleachers? Where are the peanuts and Cracker Jack?Not necessary it turns out. Based on journalist Michael Lewiss 2003 book about the team ""Moneyball is a hilarious and provocative change-up entertaining without feeling the need to swing for the fences. Its all talk but the best kind of baseball talk funny and wise and alive to the pleasures of saying as much as possible in the fewest words. Like the fresh thinking it celebrates ""Moneyball finds value in the quieter moments and the workaday players. Its an infield single but the one that wins the game.The movie also has what may be Brad Pitts sneakiest acting to date. Youre forgiven if you want to say his only acting; while the Dudacious One has always come alive in supporting roles (""Twelve Monkeys ""Burn After Reading arguably ""Fight Club) in leads he has tended to coast on his slightly vacant geniality. Some of us have always felt Pitt was a stand-in for a Player To Be Named Later.Yet the star seems energized by playing Beane a prodigious high school baseball talent who skipped college only to see a major league career refuse to materialize. Hes one of the thousands who never made it in ""the show and the experience has left him a little bitter but mostly realistic. Hes running a team the As with a 41 million payroll thats dwarfed by the 125 million the Yankees get to play with. Early in the movie the big boys finish off Beanes 2001 season by cherry-picking Johnny Damon for Boston and Jason Giambi for the Yankees. The Oakland scouts - old men with experience and hearing aids - look over the draft picks and act on their instincts. Does a player have an ugly girlfriend? Forget about him; he has no confidence.This old-school thinking drives Beane up the clubhouse wall until he meets Peter Brant (Jonah Hill) a shy numbers wonk working for the Cleveland Indians. Brants a devotee of sabermetrics the field of objective statistical analysis pioneered by writer Bill James in the 1980s and his conclusions fire Beanes imagination. Hills at his most comically froglike here - in no way does he resemble Paul DePodesta the real assistant GM on whom the character is based - and ""Moneyball plays his presence in the holy sanctum of the scouts office for maximum awkwardness. Hes the accountant in the boxing ring. The movie has been directed by Bennett Miller (""Capote) with a dry but deeply sympathetic eye for the players Beane assembles - ""the island of misfit toys as Brant dubs the team. They include pitcher Chad Bradford (Casey Bond) with his absurd underhanded throw party boy Jeremy Giambi (Nick Porrazzo) the aging David Justice (Stephen Bishop) and - most movingly - Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) a burned-out catcher whom Beane installs at first base. In the scenes with these players ""Moneyball gets at the fundamental injustice of professional baseball - the way it looks at a 35-year-old man and decides he no longer has any use.So we root for the underdogs from Beane on down as the rest of Major League Baseball becomes convinced the As have lost their collective marbles. I wont spoil how the season unfolds - if you dont know you deserve to be surprised - but its a rough road and the doubters and hecklers are many. Beane gets so much heat from his own manager Art Howe (a terrific Philip Seymour Hoffman stolid as a tackling dummy) that he trades a star player just to keep Howe in line. The managers response is priceless a long contemptuous look and the observation that Beane is ""outside of his mind.This movie has had a tough journey itself. Stan Chervins original screenplay solved the problem of how to humanize the story by introducing Beanes teenage daughter (Kerris Dorsey) who doesnt get much to do besides strum an acoustic guitar and sing Lenkas ""The Show (a song that didnt come out until 2008 but never mind). Steven Zaillian (""Schindlers List) and Aaron Sorkin (""The Social Network) both had a crack at rewrites as did Steven Soderbergh who was all set to start filming in 2009 when Columbia pulled the plug.So maybe we should be thankful the films here at all and overlook its flaws like excessive length (its 133 minutes) or the players stories that are left hanging or the fact that life doesnt always end like we want it to like movies do. And we should be grateful for Pitts perfectly laconic Beane always looking for an edge and worrying about the jinx but talking - like all baseball people do when reporters come around after the last out - as if its just another game. Seriously for the first time in a movie I feel like theres somebody inside Brad Pitts head looking out.Mostly I guess we should be grateful the As showed what statistical thinking could do for baseball and that the approach was adapted by among other people Red Sox owner John Henry (played in ""Moneyball by Arliss Howard) who among other decisions snapped up a young minor league player named Kevin Youkilis - author Lewis dubbed him ""Euclis the Greek God of walks - and offered Beane a shot at rebuilding the house that Ruth left. Boston didnt need him but we needed what he promised. As the 2002 season ends in a mixture of glory and compromise Pitts Beane finally admits that ""its hard not to be romantic about baseball. ""Moneyball figures out where love of numbers connects with love of the game and two years off you can see the Fates start to tremble.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

(Melinda Sue Gordon/C) Joe Neumaier Thursday September 22 2011 432 PM Title Moneyball With Brad Pitt Jonah Hill. A general manager tries to change baseballs rules of success. Director Bennett Miller. (206) PG-13 Language. At area theaters.To say that ""Moneyball"" is ""inside baseball"" is to undersell the idea of that sentence. This extraordinary hybrid of a movie lives and breathes the game yet its achievement is bigger than that.Theres a touch of old-fashioned romanticism here but more crucially theres strategy going on inside Bennett Millers movie -- adapted by Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian from Michael Lewiss nonfiction book -- that turns it into something cool and special.""Moneyball"" is about the economics of baseball yet its heart is concerned with the way people can out-think failure.Lost in thought is where we find the Oakland As general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) in 2001 as his team has blown an American League elimination game. Beane a onetime Mets draft pick is pondering how to get his cash-strapped club a fair shake when teams like the Yankees who just beat them have bottomless pockets.The answer comes while Beane -- on a trading trip through Cleveland -- he spots Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a doughy Yale grad. Brands analyses make him invaluable to the Indians and after some cajoling from the affable Beane he starts numbers-crunching for the As.The kids stroke of genius is figuring out a team can go all the way not by signing marquee names like Jason Giambi and Johnny Damon - players the As lost - but by signing ""misfits.""Those are guys far from polished or confident but who statistically get base hits more often. It strikes gruff manager Art Howe (a great Philip Seymour Hoffman) as nuts yet Beane plans to take this theory to the World Series.That idea when it strikes Beane is like the crack of the Wonderboy bat in ""The Natural"" but ""Moneyball"" avoids any dreaminess or melodrama. This is a smart patient film and Miller -- a steady hand whose 2005s ""Capote"" nabbed Hoffman an Oscar for Best Actor - is working in Howard Hawks territory watching guys work independently while in unison.The film brings us into a shadow world of decision-makers whose choices become multimillion-dollar entertainment while Pitt and Hill make for an odd couple winning team.Hill (""Superbad"") is endearing as an awkward sideliner learning to love his place in the world. And Pitt works a never-seen long-hoped-for glory into the corners of Beanes often-badgering decisiveness.His textured performance catches the glint of disappointment in Beanes boy-of-summer smile and its clear that his guy isnt going to let a budget or a belief strike him out.Magic Moment Beane breaks his rule of never watching games to see his players bring a theory to life.

"Moneyball | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; moneyball ) Moneyball (United States 2011) September 22 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Moneyball illustrates what can happen when a non-fiction book thats more about ideas and processes is translated into a feature film. Theres a lot of fascinating information in Moneyball (although to be fair its questionable how much interest this will hold for someone who is not a baseball fan) but the drama is fitful and at times inert. Attempts to flesh out the history and personality of the central character Oakland As General Manager Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt) lead us into standard-order bio-pic territory. Its left to secondary characters like Assistant GM Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) and As manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) to inject color and dimension. Moneyball comes to life when elaborating on Beanes unique system of player selection and the on-field baseball action is at times electrifying but it trends toward the generic when tailing him away from the stadium. The difficulty faced by the filmmakers is that Moneyball (the book) is the template for a documentary not a feature. In order to rework the essence of the written version into a film much of what makes the book worth reading is eliminated. We get bits and pieces of the ""Moneyball"" philosophy but it is distilled into snippets and sound bytes. Its a little like the beginning of Casino in which the audience is pelted with fascinating behind-the-scenes information delivered in a rat-a-tat-tat fashion. Here as in the book Beane is the central figure but the movie is more interested in him as a character than as a sabermetrician. In flashbacks we see his failure as a one-time highly regarded prospect. In the main time frame which chronicles the 2002 season we follow his ""adoption"" of Yale Graduate Peter Brand (a fictionalized Paul DePodesta) and we are presented with token snapshots of his relationship with his 12-year old daughter (Kathryn Morris) and ex-wife (Robin Wright). The focus of Moneyball is how Beane used unconventional statistic-oriented methods to identify undervalued players to populate a roster and fit within a limited payroll. Beanes embrace of sabermetrics caused a shift in how front offices around the league evaluated players but there are critics of Beanes overreliance upon it. Oakland has never won (or even participated in) a World Series since Beane took over as GM so its fair to argue that while the ""Moneyball"" philosophy is a good approach to the regular 162-game season its not necessarily a recipe for success in the postseason. The book debates these points in detail. The movie glosses over them. Director Bennett Miller came to the project late after Steven Soderbergh bowed out due to creative differences. Soderberghs intended approach to mix feature film and documentary elements was scrapped in favor of a more traditional narrative structure. The screenplay originally by Steven Zaillian and re-worked by Aaron Sorkin falls short of what Sorkin achieved with The Social Network and lacks the moments of ""punch"" that have defined many of his previous scripts. Its possible to see the director and writers struggling to develop a dramatic arc where one only marginally exists. ""Moneyball"" is a philosophy and without a rigorous explanation of baseball stats its difficult to explore in detail. A major element of the book - examining the 2002 amateur draft - is left out of the movie completely. Ironically in attempting to make Moneyball accessible to those with no affinity for baseball the filmmakers have created a misfit production that relies on the box office appeal of star Brad Pitt. Pitt is effective and charismatic as Beane the fiery one time phenom who puts his job on the line by embracing a method of team-building that is derided by baseball lifers. The actor breathes life into the most difficult kind of on-screen personality an ""ordinary guy."" There are no ""Oscar bait"" tactics here - Beane is not handicapped hes not an idiot savant he was not abused as a child he does not age backward he does not dine on human flesh and hes not Keiser Sose. Hes basically the guy next door albeit one with control over a Major League baseball team. If one wants to consider Pitts 2012 Oscar chances hes being mentioned equally as a Best Actor nominee for Moneyball and a Best Supporting Actor choice for Tree of Life. Neither part is showy but they illustrate something that larger-than-life roles often do not his breadth as a performer. Mention should also be made of Jonah Hill who steps out of his safety zone and away from his stereotyped image to take a stab at a serious role. Philip Seymour Hoffman (who has a close relationship with director Miller) and Robin Wright Penn are famous faces without a lot to do although Hoffman makes the real-life Howe come across as dour and intractable although not unsympathetic. For the baseball fan in particular stretches of Moneyball are more than engaging - seeing how Beane constructed the 2002 out of the ashes of the 2001 edition which was ravaged by free agent departures; watching losing baseball becoming the winning variety; and re-living ""the streak"" - a 20-game odyssey that made ""Moneyball"" a common word in baseball circles. However the As five-game loss to the Twins in the 2002 ALDS is handled perfunctorily and Moneyball meanders toward the end trying to find the right stopping point. Non-baseball lovers may enjoy the proceedings but are likely to be less impressed than their sports-savvy counterparts. It will be interesting to see how much of the early Academy Awards word-of-mouth is transformed into late-innings buzz and ultimately into Oscar gold.

More about Moneyball >> Funny furious and full of front-office drama Bennett Millers savvy adaptation of Michael Lewis best-seller Moneyball The Art of Winning an Unfair Game presents the real story of Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane a tobacco-chewing Twinkie-scarfing strategist who found himself and his team in the throes of crisis. The year was 2001 and after losing to the New York Yankees in the playoffs the As suffered even greater indignity Their three stars - Jason Giambi Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen - were lured away by cash-rich rivals. With an owner who couldnt match the stratospheric salaries Beane was stuck His roster was full of head cases underachievers has-beens. Whats a guy whos spent his whole life in baseball - first as a player then as a scout and manager - to do? He goes to Cleveland meets a nerd kid doing stats for the Indians and sets about building a new team based on new paradigms on a new kind of math. Never mind the grizzled gang of coaches and their recommendations - recommendations based on gut and instinct and the way a player comports himself. Hire the guys with high on-base percentages and low salaries. Hire the guys nobody wants. If this all sounds like well inside baseball it is. But its one of the great accomplishments of the Moneyball screenplay - from Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian - that the story works even if you have no idea what an ERA or Sabermetrics is. Brad Pitt who stars as Beane has a lot to do with this too. Pacing around and banging stuff and trying to balance his professional life with whats left of his personal one (hes divorced and trying to be some kind of dad for his little girl) Pitts Beane goes from gloomy despair to crazy hope. Its a classic trajectory Capra-esque and crowd-pleasing but Pitt adds layers of emotional depth mixing moments of wild rage and frustration with a beautifully quiet inward-reaching performance. Dont be surprised to see Pitt in the best-actor Oscar race come the new year. Jonah Hill as Peter Brand the visibly fidgety statistician is a revelation too. The overweight over-perspiring dork of Superbad and Funny People pushes his twitchy awkwardness in uncharted directions and the interplay between Pitt and Hills characters - as the two embark on their crackpot mission - is something to behold. One great sequence set on trade-deadline day has Beane working the phones playing one general manager off another while Brand mugs mimes and offers counsel. The breathless bidding culminates with Hill delivering a totally dweeby - and exquisitely triumphant - fist pump. Philip Seymour Hoffman his hair in a buzz cut and his girth spilling out of an As uniform is manager Art Howe who doesnt see eye to eye with Beane and his newfangled ideas. The increasingly confrontational encounters between the old-school practitioner and his boss are among Moneyballs most satisfying scenes. Actually I take that back. Moneyball is one satisfying scene after another - smartly written superbly acted realized with an eye for telling detail. Hey its a sports movie right so forgive me Moneyball its a home run.

Baseball Fanatics Wonder Is Moneyball Fair or Foul? Brad Pitt stars in a compelling look behind the scenes of the big leagues that gives the term ""inside baseball"" a good name This is something that American men are never supposed to admit but here goes -- I dont care about sports. I never followed a team Ive never cared who won the Super Bowl or the World Series and I can count on one hand the number of games Ive watched from start to finish on television. So its really saying something that I was riveted by ""Moneyball."" And yes its set in the world of pro baseball exploring how Oakland As general manager Billy Beane subverted the dominant paradigm by assembling a team of inexpensive non-flashy players who could make it to base rather than spend millions on celebrity hot-shot ballers who might or might not deliver on the field. But really ""Moneyball"" is about throwing out the established conventions of doing business and trying something new. So it could be about the iPod or the Obama 2008 campaign or the Fox networks decision to air new episodes of ""Beverly Hills 90210"" during summer rerun season. Also read Can Moneyball Hit a Box-Office Home Run If the As Stink? This isnt a sports story its a tale of bold visionaries so its a perfect follow-up to ""The Social Network"" for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin collaborating here with the equally acclaimed Steven Zaillian (""Schindlers List"" the upcoming ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo""). Baseball fans will presumably enjoy a peek behind the curtain of the 2002 season but you dont need to know a bunt from a sacrifice fly to enjoy the movie any more than you needed to write HTML code to follow ""Social Network."" ""Moneyball"" begins with Beanes disappointment at the end of the 2001 season -- not only do the much-better-funded New York Yankees knock the As out of the playoffs but Oakland is also about to lose its star players (Jason Giambi Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen) to teams that can offer them higher salaries. Also read Baseball Fanatics Wonder Is Moneyball Fair or Foul? Attempting to replace these stars with a minimal budget Beane visits the Cleveland Indians head office and finds some unexpected talent Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a number-cruncher who graduated from Yale with an economics degree and who has formulated an entirely different way of evaluating players. Brand doesnt care about their confidence or their handsomeness or their fielding skills or their throwing arms -- everything boils down to whether or not they can get on base even if its by walking. The more players on base the logic goes the more runs scored and the more games won. The scouts for the As refuse to believe that the process can be boiled down to statistics but Beane believes in Peters theories particularly since Beane himself was a once-promising young player who gave up a full ride at Stanford to play baseball right out of high school only to disappoint once hed made it to the big time. The flashbacks of his lackluster career as a player underscore the older wiser Beanes decision to rely on past performance rather than future potential in choosing players. So when Beane winds up with a roster filled with rejects has-beens old guys and injured players everyone from the front office to sports radio thinks hes lost his mind. But as 2002 moves from spring training to the games of summer to the playoffs the nay-sayers are in for some surprises. ""Moneyball"" is based on Michael Lewis book and while the movie could have been an endless series of phone calls and people staring at screens director Bennett Miller (""Capote"") keeps things percolating mixing in disparate elements like Beanes family life and his conflicts with team manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman all buzz-cut and red-nosed and looking like George Dzundza) and making everything feel organic to the story. Which is not to say the phone calls arent riveting as well -- theres a scene where Beane and Peter juggle three different teams in an attempt to close a trade thats a little masterpiece of managerial chicanery. If ""A River Runs Through It"" was Pitt channeling young golden-boy Robert Redford then this film represents Pitt growing into his predecessors later roles in films like ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Candidate"" where he took a somewhat bemused and cynical look at the world around him. Having come up through major league baseball on both sides of the bench Beane knows how entrenched the sport is with doing business in a certain way but he nonetheless forges ahead with his (and Peters) radical notions. Whether Beane is berating a losing team or spending quality time with his daughter (Kerris Dorsey) Pitt gets every moment just right. Somewhat surprisingly Hill more than holds his own opposite Pitt exercising comedy muscles weve never seen him use on screen before. In movies like ""Accepted"" ""Superbad"" and ""Cyrus"" Hill generates a wonderful brand of manic-nebbish energy but here hes a tamped-down tie-wearing soft-spoken Ivy Leaguer and yet even within those constraints his comic timing is perfect turning the most disposable throw-away lines into nuggets of hilarity. The best of the ""based on a true story"" films manage to make things suspenseful even when youre aware how they turned out in real life. And while I was completely unaware of these events even baseball fans may be surprised at the aftermath of the 2002 season and its ongoing impact on Beanes life.

Moneyball Good Director Bennett Miller. Cast Brad Pitt Jonah Hill Philip Seymour Hoffman. Rating PG for some strong language. This weeks new movie releases Baseball movies Spotlight Brad Pitt Michael Lewis 2003 book - about the experiment conducted by Oakland As general manager Billy Beane to scout and evaluate players not by the tried-and-true method of look and feel that had been in place for a century but by cold computer-crunched data - was a best-seller. It also was divisive in the baseball world a slap in the face of the grand old game to some a necessary dose of modernization to others. Interview Brad Pitt Beane became a magnet of controversy. His obsession was trying to steer a team with a rock-bottom budget toward the playoffs and maybe beyond. The old ways werent working; before the 2002 season he lost his three best players because the As were too cheap to pay them market value so why not try something new? All of that is interesting as far as it goes. But how in the world would you make a movie about it? Ask Bennett Miller because he has made a good one. He has had a lot of help from Brad Pitt who plays Beane and Jonah Hill who plays Peter Brand a low-level executive in the Cleveland Indians organization who espoused the sabermetrics theory as its called. Beane hired him away to bring the theory to the As and the two men executed it ruthlessly despite resistance from all corners. A movie about a couple of guys poring over computer-generated statistics about on-base percentages wouldnt work. Miller wisely makes ""Moneyball"" a kind of buddy movie with Beane the lifelong baseball man (a cant-miss prospect in his youth who did in fact miss) paired with the Yale-educated Brand who loves the game but couldnt play it but who figured out a way to be a part of it. The two actors are outstanding together; really they could be mismatched cops or doctors or whatever other odd-couple characters weve seen in movies a thousand times before. Setting them in the world of baseball gives the trope fresh currency; their performances the way their differences dont cloud their ultimate agreement on how to run the team make it good. Brand learned his theories from Bill James who wrote a book that set the whole sabermetrics concept in motion. (James is not portrayed in the film.) In one of the funniest and best scenes in the movie the dumpy little Brand sits down at a table of old-school scouts for a meeting. Repeatedly Beane passes over the incredulous scouts for Brands opinion. What the scouts demand to know is going on here? They arent the only ones who feel threatened. Manager Art Howe played with a fatalistic grumpiness by Philip Seymour Hoffman (Howe is convinced hes going to be fired after the season because Beane wont extend his contract) not only disagrees with Beanes plans but for a time openly defies them. I wont spoil things by telling you how the 2002 season ended for the As if you dont remember. And you can quibble as much as you like at one of the assertions made at the end of the film (youll know it when you see it). Far too much time is spent on a winning streak the As embark upon. In between the course of the season Miller tells Beanes story in flashback passing up a scholarship to Stanford to sign with the New York Mets out of high school only to have his playing career fizzle. We also meet his ex-wife and daughter establishing him as a solid decent guy who nevertheless thinks nothing of teaching Brand to be ruthlessly efficient when cutting a player (though hes somewhat more tactful when doing the job himself). On some level ""Moneyball"" is about loyalty loyalty to an idea loyalty to a partnership forged by desperation loyalty to the values you believe in. Whether that was Lewis intention in the book or Beanes intention in taking the risk doesnt matter. Its the formula Miller came up with for the film and with the team of Pitt and Hill its a winning one. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Moneyball movie review by Chicago Tribunes Michael Phillips - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies Moneyball The Un-Natural Moneyball Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill star in ""Moneyball."" Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill star in ""Moneyball."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Director Bennett Millers ""Moneyball"" is the perfect sports movie for these cash-strapped times of efficiency maximization. Its also the best sports movie in a long time period as well as honestly inspirational -- even though nobody knocks one into the lights causing showers of sparks to blend in the night sky with the fireworks.This is not that film. Its better than that film. The focus on facts figures sabermetrics and cold hard stats never competes with the human beings batting those stats around in their heads. ""Moneyball"" which took years and several false starts to come to fruition fixes on the story of Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane played by Brad Pitt in a performance sharp enough to match the stealthy marvel of the film supporting that performance.How Beane budgeted and strategized his way to the playoffs with the second-lowest payroll in the majors hinged on buying a motley crew of underdogs who werent pretty or expensive. But they could get on base. Everything in Beanes story and in ""Moneyball"" couldve been rendered dull or sappy or both by a lesser director. It is at heart about a man out to redeem himself. As a middle-class suburban San Diego high schooler Beane was a hotly pursued star athlete fielding among other offers a joint baseball-football Stanford University scholarship. The New York Mets were also interested in his future. Beane signed with the Mets in 1980 scrapping his college plans. Then the phenom in the making never materialized. Beanes volatile temper kept messing with his concentration his results.Years later Beane found himself in Oakland presiding as general manager over the As and knocking around the clubhouse described in Michael Lewiss Oexcellent book (also called ""Moneyball"") as ""the cheapest and least charming real estate in professional baseball."" The team was in pain. The New York Yankees scooped up first baseman Jason Giambi for a seven-year 120 million contract among other holes to fill.Into Beanes life came Harvard graduate Paul DePodesta. To simplify probably in a way that will cause heart murmurs among ""Baseball Abstracts"" fanatics Beanes assistant GM believed in statistical analysis and the importance of a players on-base percentage more so than his batting average. Suddenly at least in Oakland at the start of the 2002 season traditional scouting reports regarding a players viability and personality and appeal were out of favor. Here Beane hoped was a way of spread-sheeting a team to relative glory.The DePodesta equivalent in ""Moneyball"" is a Yale economics whiz named Peter Brand played by Jonah Hill. Much of the script focuses on the odd-couple relationship between Brand and Beane. Hill does very little acting here meaning What he does he does with a canny sense of hesitancy (he seems perpetually afraid of getting tobacco juice  spit into his Ivy League eye) and a pinpoint brand of comic timing. The script by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin with Stan Chervin receiving story credit layers judicious flashbacks to Beanes early professional disappointments inside the rest of the story. Robin Wright plays Beanes ex-wife (the director Spike Jonze appears unbilled as her spacey easygoing new man). More prominently Kerris Dorsey Oplays the Beanes daughter. Pitt is quite wonderful in these scenes of post-divorce parenthood making connections where and how he can with a bright adaptable kid. Zaillians sense of structure dovetails unusually well with Sorkins verbal acuity. Offhanded comments such as ""If hes a good hitter why dont he hit good?"" dont sound writerly; they sound right. Theres a calm and honest tone to ""Moneyball"" so that when Bennett lingers a second on a shot (inside a flashback) of young Beane shaking hands with the Mets recruiter we catch the look of doubt in Beanes fathers eyes. As As manager Art Howe Philip Seymour Hoffman (who won an Oscar for his performance in ""Capote"") keeps his performance even more contained than Hills so that after a tense early meeting with Beane the only distress signal Howe emits is a little shake of his left hand rattling his wristwatch.With ""Capote"" six years ago director Miller made his first non-documentary feature. The film established him as a rare and contemplative talent adept at making interpersonal dynamics and matters of workaday procedure come alive. Hes done it again with ""Moneyball"" and Pitt who executive-produced has reached a point in his stardom where hes rightly concerned with becoming the best actor he can be by working with the most interesting directors out there. The film lacks a few things. Despite some offhanded outbursts we never really see the dangerous side to Beane the demons that messed him up as a player. The codas on the sentimental side. The scripts third act may frustrate sports movie fans conditioned to expect a certain kind of wow. But ""Moneyball"" cant make more of what the As achieved than this. Otherwise itd be phony.I love Millers straight-ahead steady-gaze approach to the subject and to filmmaking. Last years Oscar-winning cinematographer Wally Pfister gives the back offices and clubhouse interiors an evocatively cruddy tone. The images have been astutely assembled by editor Christopher Tellefsen who worked so well with Miller on ""Capote."" The results dont grab; rather they entice. ""Moneyball"" is about shedding past selves and traditions once they become mere conventions and Bennetts sophomore feature is an unconventional winner. mjphillipstribune.com Moneyball -- 4 stars MPAA rating PG-13 (for some strong language) Cast Brad Pitt (Billy Beane); Jonah Hill (Peter Brand); Philip Seymour Hoffman (Art Howe); Robin Wright (Sharon); Kerris Dorsey (Casey) Credits Directed by Bennett Miller; written by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin based on the book by Michael Lewis; produced by Michael De Luca Rachael Horovitz and Brad Pitt.

"Moneyball (PG-13) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Moneyball (PG-13) If you love baseball you will love this movie. If you dont care about baseball you will still love this movie. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com9/21/2011 Editor rating 4 The great American game of baseball has generated more good movies than practically any other sport (boxing is probably a close second). But there has never been a baseball picture quite like Moneyball - a film where most of the action takes place not on the field but inside the offices of general managers and team owners. Adapted from Michael Lewis non-fiction book by the formidable writing team of Steven Zaillian (Schindlers List) and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) and directed with a refreshing maturity and respect for the audiences intelligence by Bennett Miller (Capote) the movie is an absolute triumph of culturally relevant filmmaking - a film that will thrill and fascinate sport junkies and non-fans alike. If you like baseball you will love this movie. If you hate baseball you will still love this movie. Brad Pitt delivering the best and most complex performance of his career stars as Billy Beane the general manager of the Oakland As who watched his team lose to the New York Yankees in 2001 in an elimination game for the World Series. Beane was faced with an impossible situation His operating budget of 39 million simply couldnt compete with the deeper pockets of other teams (the Yankees budget that year was 114 million). Without the cash to lure the best players Beane had no way to remain in the race for the pennant. In an early scene in the film he meets with the As owner explains his dilemma and begs for more money only to be told that the As are a small-market team and that he should forget about competing with the big boys. But Beane who passed up a free ride to Stanford as a teenager in order to play in the major leagues and failed miserably isnt content with settling. There has to be a way to remain viable without paying players outrageous salaries. When he meets Peter Brand (played by Jonah Hill in a revelatory performance) a young economics major who works for the Cleveland Indians with an uncanny talent for crunching numbers and statistics Beane immediately senses hes onto something. ""Baseball thinking is medieval"" Peter tells him calling the sport an epidemic failure of mismanaged teams and misjudged players. Beane hires the numbers whiz away from the Indians and immediately puts him to work building a team of players whose statistics may not be all that impressive but who together could make a formidable squad. Although Moneyball is set ten years in the past the movie could not be more relevant to the present-day. This is an exploration of how to do more with less - how to think outside the box and break established conventions when the money and resources have dried up and a radical new way of doing things is necessary in order to survive. Pitt who has grown from a pretty face to one of the best actors of his generation gives the performance of his career as the pragmatic indefatigable Beane. He refuses to take no for an answer even when everyone around him tells him hes tilting at windmills. He has the physical grace of a former athlete and the realistic outlook of a businessman When he has to fire one of his players he looks him straight in the eye and breaks the news without the slightest bit of emotion or condescension. Hes a realist who knows baseball is a business but he has the heart of a player and he wants to win - or at least be competitive enough to remain in the game - not just for monetary gain but for the thrill of victory. Moneyball is often very funny When the As talent scouts meet to talk about prospective recruits for the upcoming season one of them rules out a potential player because he has an ugly girlfriend which means he lacks self-confidence. Hill (Superbad Funny People) is perfect as the eager-to-please genius who always initially answers questions with what he thinks people want to hear then tells the truth when pushed to cut to the chase. He and Pitt make a wonderful pair They bounce off each other like seasoned comedians. Moneyball makes time to give us glimpses into Beanes personal life Hes a divorced father with a daughter (Kerris Dorsey) who adores him and a scene in which he visits his ex-wife and her new husband (played by Robin Wright Penn and Spike Jonze) perfectly captures the awkwardness and veiled resentment of a former couple who are trying to play nice for the sake of their child. Moneyball works better if you dont know what happened in 2002 when Beane used his computer-generated strategy of taking on players whose statistics were solid but not impressive - a strategy that deeply irritated the teams manager played with hilarious fury by Phillip Seymour Hoffman. But even if youre familiar with how that fateful season turned out Moneyball still makes for utterly absorbing resonant entertainment - the true story of a man who changed the way professional baseball is played and in the process paved the way for an entirely new way of running a business. This resplendent rousing picture - by far the best Ive seen this year - is the kind that only comes along once every few years Its a perfect movie that doesnt strike a single false note.

Tellingly that Kevin Costner classic was a movie as much about talk -- loose low-down purplish inspired -- as it was about baseball. The supersmart and rousing Moneyball which may be the best baseball movie since Bull Durham is also about talk but in a coolly heady and original inside-the-front-office way. Based on Michael Lewis 2003 nonfiction book Moneyball The Art of Winning an Unfair Game the picture was scripted by the powerhouse team of Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin and directed by Capotes Bennett Miller here proving his major-league mettle. It opens with footage of a 2002 playoff series in which the New York Yankees beat the Oakland As a series that is meant to illustrate what the film presents as the essential rigged reality of modern sports The deeper a teams pockets the more probable it is that that team will win. The Yankees who took that series had a budget of 114 million; the As 39 million. The moment that Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) the As general manager walks into the office of the teams owner to plead for a bigger budget Moneyball is drenched in a kind of wise-guy-jock knowingness about what makes professional baseball tick. Yet the dialogue is so light and sharp it just about cuts the air. Billy a former big-money player whose own career didnt pan out is too superstitious to even watch the games. Sitting around arguing with his aging scouts (the scenes have the kind of flavor that lets you smell the locker room) Billy knows his season is doomed. Its during a trading meeting with the Cleveland Indians that he meets and poaches a young assistant -- Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a graduate of Yale -- who has used computer analysis to perfect a statistical vision of the game thats more refined and maybe more humane than the standard drill of big-money-buys-big-talent. Brands insight is that if you ignore a lot of the obvious flaws that damage players in the eyes of professional scouts (bad legs cant field too thick in the middle likes strip clubs and weed too much) and you focus instead on one single telltale metric -- the percentage of times that they get on base -- then tons of players who dont cost very much will turn out to be winners. What would happen if you built an entire team out of these green-diamond misfits? That was Billy Beanes grand desperate experiment. And Moneyball in following how it turned out with a heightened journalistic intricacy may be the first baseball film to tap into the thrill of strategizing -- of manipulated cause and effect -- as entertainingly as youd expect from a movie about chess or a casino heist. (Steven Soderbergh spent a long time developing this project before he and the studio parted ways and you can still feel his fingerprints on it.) As an actor Brad Pitt has aged like a fine wine. In Moneyball hes in classic game-on movie-star mode his hair flopping with boyish insolence over his rugged features but beneath his funny exhilarating tossed-off strut of a performance he gives Billy a deep river of self-doubt as well as a need to prove himself that never quite comes out and shows itself. (Thats its nagging power.) The trading scenes done mostly over the phone are little comedies of brusqueness with the names of players flaunted and abandoned like cards in a poker game. Jonah Hill spouting a gnomic fans mastery of stats brings his whole deadpan-geek thing to a new height of pinpoint timing (hes like a stone-faced rabbi of baseball) and Philip Seymour Hoffman as the team manager Art Howe does a character turn thats as fresh for him as the crew cut that makes him look like a grizzled old-timer. Howe hates Billy and this whole method but the tension between these two is never merely cute. Moneyball takes quite a while to get to anything like a big game but when it does as the As approach the climax of an audacious winning streak youll feel that fist-pump rush. The film is a little long with one too many endings but its a baseball drama about something novel and rich Billys desire not just to win but to change the game -- to take it back from the accountants and rediscover the joy of players who could still triumph by surprising you.

Moneyball is not your grandpas baseball movie. Even if you dont know a fly ball from a snowball and couldnt care less how the great American pastime turned into the great American religion this is a great American movie that will leave you cheering. Sure its the familiar formula about a losing team (the Oakland Athletics) catapulted to glory by a tough idealistic general manager (controversial Billy Beane immortalized in a compelling performance by Brad Pitt at the top of his game). But thanks to the awesome collaboration of two brilliant Oscar-winning screenwriters Steven Zaillian (Schindlers List) and Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) and one polished director Bennett Miller (Capote) expect a vacation from cliches and a home run in the final inning with the bases loaded.  Based on the best-seller by writer Michael Lewis Moneyball details the unconventional strategy devised by Beane shortly after the As lost the American League Division Series to the New York Yankees in 2001. In a sink-or-swim decision he compared the other teams funded by huge budgets with his own team owners and outdated scouts who couldnt afford to recruit champions and weighed his options ""Were the last dog bowl in the room--and you know what happens to the runt of the litter? He dies."" During a strategy meeting to beg favors from the Cleveland Indians he notices a fat nerdy young economics graduate from Yale named Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) who specializes in team management based on player analysis. To everyones amazement and derision he becomes fascinated by such an oddball and actually hires him as his dorky new assistant. Brand hits the computer and comes up with 25 names they can afford. They rebuilt the team with tapped losers traded for damaged players and bargained for defective rejects then switched their positions on the field. Even Art Howe the pessimistic new team coach (startlingly bald Philip Seymour Hoffman) was hired with a one-year contract because its all their budget would allow. Shy almost socially autistic and definitely inept in business Peter nevertheless juggled figures in his head and came up with a scheme that revolutionized major league baseball. ""Adapt or die"" was the new motto. It was a colossal gamble but suddenly the game was blackjack and Billy 44 and his new assistant 25 became the players who changed the casino rules. Treating baseball as science instead of reverence they called their eyebrow-raising experiment ""moneyball"" and the press massacred them for it. But when the Oakland As won 19 games in a row--the longest winning streak in baseball--the team soared to American League stardom. The rest is history. Its a story that holds up beautifully in the re-telling but the best thing about Moneyball is the human element. Billy Beane is not soft-pedaled into a deity and Brad Pitt takes impeccable precautions not to underplay his abrasive personality. Except for caring about his daughters respect and a grudging fondness for his remarried ex-wife (Robin Wright in a one-scene cameo) theres nothing about his personal life. He shows no hidden compassion for his players as human beings trading and cutting them at will with no advance warning and flies into rants and smashes up the furniture at will. You may not admire him but you cant help but like Brad Pitt even when he overdoes his trademark mannerism of saying almost every line with his mouth full of food and drink. (At last weeks Toronto International Film Festival he admitted he doesnt even like baseball.) Chubby Jonah Hill is perfect casting as Peter Brand the computer doofus obsessed with statistics but his own private life is a blank page too. Hoffman is largely wasted in the dugout looking grouchy. Still in the crack pacing smart dialogue and exhilarating camerawork by Wally Pfister any quibbles of mine are minor. This is a subtle elegant and altogether triumphant film about a subject I thought I was tired of told with an artistry and freshness that is positively thrilling. rreedobserver.com MONEYBALL Running Time 133 minutes Written by Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin Directed by Bennett Miller Starring Brad Pitt Robin Wright and Jonah Hill 3.5/4 Comment Filed under Aaron Sorkin baseball Brad Pitt Jonah Hill movie Movie Review Oakland Athletics Robin Wright statistics Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture No Alarms No Surprises Why Buying Concert Tickets Is a Rigged System Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://www.observer.com/2011/09/moneyball-is-a-home-run/,200,moneyball35,moneyball,observer

The As have not had a winning season since making the playoffs in 06 which is to say they are long removed from the summer of 2002 when they were revolutionaries who reinvented baseball by embracing the radical teachings of a pork-and-beans plant security guard who shed the sport of its myths romanticism and pageantry and turned it into a math equation. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Michael Lewiss book Moneyball was published in 2003 in the immediate wake of The Season That Shook Baseball. The story didnt look like much on the surface Beane a former ballplayer-turned-scout-turned-GM and Paul DePodesta an Ivy League wonk took a measly 39 million salary budget crunched the numbers and turned overlooked undervalued statistics into overachieving undervalued ballplayers and ended up . . . losing the American League Division Series to the Minnesota Twins the second of four straight one-and-dones for the As. Yet the book would serve as a bible for every baseball executive and stat-obsessed fan. The As stink now only because all the other teams beat them at their own game.Lewiss account serves solely as inspiration for its engaging big-screen counterpart; director Bennett Miller (Capote) and writers Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian barely touch upon sabermetrics and the influential work of statistician Bill James. The filmmakers wisely boil down Beane and DePodestas complex formulas to a single simple thesis Sign ballplayers who get on base more than anyone else. Then they hand over the movie to Brad Pitt as Beane a former first-round draft pick by the New York Mets who exorcises his dashed-dream demons one trade thrown chair and turned-over watercooler at a time. Play ball.Turns out that translating the numbers-heavy Moneyball for the multiplex was fairly straightforward after all Like every other sports movie ever its the story of The Little Team That Could. The film begins at an ending October 15 2001 when the Yankees with a payroll of 114 million knock the low-budget As out of the ALDS. Beane loses more than that game Three of his best players are leaving their price tags too high for Oakland. He cant afford to replace the brand names only their on-base and slugging percentages so he and Peter Brand (the DePodesta character played by Jonah Hill terrific in his transition out of stoner comedy) stock their dugout with rejects and has-beens whose potential only they can see. Everyone else including manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman looking hangdog and emasculated) and scout Grady Fuson (Ken Medlock a fastball of fury) believes they will destroy their team their sport.Fuson especially thinks Beanes a fool who has taken baseballs betrayal personally. In flashbacks we see a young Billy (played by Reed Thompson) wooed by scouts impressed with his five-tool ability. He could have been great but for whatever reason--too much head not enough heart who really knows--flamed out. Fuson tells Beane he has declared war on baseball just to get even. And he might have a point Pitt stalks the clubhouse spits out his orders and gnaws on whatever tobacco plug or junk food is set before him like hes trying to devour the world. Only when hes with his 12-year-old daughter does he seem at all at peace and at all sympathetic which might be why the filmmakers wedged her into the plot. And thats another difference between Moneyball the movie and Moneyball the book--theres extra warmth radiating onscreen from beneath the cold hard statistics.I keep Lewiss book on a shelf next to North Dallas Forty Peter Gents tome about his playing days under Cowboys coach Tom Landry. The insider Gent and outsider Lewis tell essentially the same story Computers do not lie they do not romanticize they do not judge. ""None of you is as good as that computer""--thats what the coach tells his team in the film adaptation of North Dallas Forty a line that just as easily could have come from Sorkin or Zaillian.But North Dallas Forty on the big screen was mean cold brutal--a tale of betrayal and violence told from the perspective of the abused player left for dead meat. Moneyballs not like that at all. Perhaps thats because its a baseball movie and ""its hard not to be romantic about baseball"" as Beane says during a rare moment of happiness as the As become for a few weeks the greatest team in the history of the American League. Thats thanks to the home-run heroics of a forgotten player given one last chance by Billy Beane. It really happened its really corny and its really great. Who needs Roy Hobbs? Hey Dad?

On one level its a conventional sports-underdog narrative in which Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) hits on a way to make serious contenders out of a small-market team with a fraction of the resources of say the Yankees. But the fortunes of the As arent transformed by the usual formula comebacka slugger regaining his confidence or a wayward pitcher learning to locate his fastball. Moneyball is the first go-for-it sports film to turn on spreadsheets. Its The Bad News Bears for M.B.A.s. See Also Brads Pitch Why Pitt Was Willing to Go to Bat for Moneyball The movie doesnt quite come together but its full of smart cynical talk and its very entertaining. The title itself has a subversive kick since the businessmen who run the game work hard to keep you from connecting our two great American pastimes let alone yoking them together into a myth-deflating new word. Moneyball opens in anti-romantic gloom in 2001 with Beane by himself in the darkened Oakland Coliseum listening to a radio broadcast of his team across the country being beaten in the playoffs by the Yankees. (Beane doesnt watch games in personhe thinks hes jinxed.) A title card informs you that the Yanks have almost four times the players-salary budget of the As and theyre about to flaunt their bankroll again by snatching one of Beanes stars Jason Giambi. (The Red Sox take the other Johnny Damon.) Beane vents to the owner that the As are like a farm system for richer teams (or worse like organ donors) and pleads in vain for more money. Later he mocks a table of scouts for trying to find substitutes at bargain-basement prices for sluggers like Giambi and Damon instead of thinking outside the batters box. It turns out that Beane has another reason to be bitter about old-timer scouts and their gut instincts They once broke his heart. Woven through Moneyball is his sad life story how in high school young Billy (played by Reed Thompson) was persuaded to pass up Stanford by New York Mets scouts who assured him he had everything it took to be a superstar and how he struck outover and overin the majors. His past present and future come together when he meets Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) a painfully wonky young Cleveland Indians employee with an economics degree from Yale who blurts out that theres an epidemic failure to understand what is really happening in the game. Brand is a student of sabermetrics pioneer Bill James who argues that the most important player stat of all isnt a batting average but the far less glamorous on-base percentage. And baseball is full of older or injured or otherwise undervalued players with low BAs and high OBPs who get walked a lot and run up pitch counts and happen to be on base when the slugger hits one out. Two top-flight screenwriters adapted Lewiss book Steven Zaillian who has a knack for digging a narrative out of a thicket of minutiae and Aaron Sorkin who can add the minutiae back and give it a screwball momentum. Miller isnt a screwball director (the funereal Capote proved that) but the scenes in which the odd couple of Beane and Brand build a team out of castoffs (among them David Justice and Jason Giambis party-hearty brother Jeremy) have an old-fashioned comic hum and its a great moment when Beane infuriates his head scout (a delightfully gruff turn by Ken Medlock) to the point where he has to fire him for insubordination. Phone negotiations with other teams G.M.s are dizzying Ping-Pong matches with Brand feeding names to Beane who keeps up an intimidatingly steady patter hangs up and then waits the clock ticking for his adversary to call back. Hill has never been better than against Pitts rapid-fire machismoblinking twitching finally rising to the occasion a beautiful soul liberated in wonderment from a hapless blob of flesh. And Pitt? Hes dazzlingly good. He still channels Robert Redford but its the right part to channel the witty understatement the mastery of the pause-and-stare to suggest the wheels turning in his head. Pitt doesnt play against his movie-star handsomeness He acts like a man who knows hes handsome and also knows its not enough. Miller and cinematographer Wally Pfister light Pitt to bring out the hollows in his eyes so he bears a resemblance to Benicio Del Torosoulful with a hint of dissolution and down the road decrepitude. It helps. So does Pitts tender rapport with Kerris Dorsey as Beanes daughter who tapes a song for him that plays in the final scene like the blessing of an angel. 1 2 Next Share this story...

Youve done something important something weighty and youve done it with panache. Verve even. The degree of difficulty involved in taking a complex theme (the concept of undervalued assets) and molding it into a coherent and entertaining two-hour film is substantial but theyve pulled it off. Though more abstract than most mainstream films Moneyball is still a movie that should appeal to a broad audience. In the film version of Moneyball adapted from the Michael Lewis book Brad Pitt plays Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane. Hes driven to win because he hates losing only he knows he cant simply go out and spend 100 million dollars on high-priced talent. Brad Pitt doesnt do anything particularly noteworthy here but he doesnt take anything off the table either. Jonah Hill (as assistant GM Peter Brand though in real life his name was Paul DePodesta) is as quiet as youve ever seen him a credit to his range and Philip Seymour Hoffman is truculent and stubborn as As manager Art Howe even though hes in only about 10 minutes of the film. But where Moneyball really shines is by humanizing the metrics revolution in baseball. Screenwriters Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin have delivered a script that is wry and humorous offering something entertaining for everyone from fantasy baseball players to soccer moms. The story of the Oakland Athletics in the early 2000s Moneyball is the tale of a management team that did things a little differently. Baseball unlike the three other major sports has no salary cap no guarantee that all the teams are competing with an equal amount of resources. Its inherently unfair a market economy and the small market teams have a tough time competing for the higher priced players due to less revenue. So how does one compete under these conditions? By getting intellectually nimble which is precisely what Beane did. For 100 years there was a school of thought that said you could tell everything you needed to know about a ballplayer from watching him the way he swung the way he carried himself. Results were important sure but where it came to measuring how teams actually won baseball games the methodologies were woefully ignorant. Tradition ruled the day and teams acted illogically because that was simply ""the way things were done."" But out there in the baseball wilderness was a kid named Bill James who thought many of the experts had it all wrong. Like all change agents throughout history his ideas were at first universally rejected and despised. Then a radical few like Billy Beane came on board. Now the idea of utilizing your assets efficiently and looking for value on the cheap holds sway over the majority of decision makers. Sure there are statistical battles still being waged in baseball but the war is pretty much over as most MLB teams now rely on advanced analytical reasoning to build their teams. Billy Beane won the larger war but thats not where the tension of Moneyball is to be found. The day in day out grind of running a major league baseball team where youre being outspent by a factor of five while still trying to be a good dad is what makes Moneyball compelling and it gets stronger as the film flies by. It sounds hyperbolic but I didnt want it to end and Id like to see a sequel. If youre a fan of well-paced adult dramas Moneyball pays in a big way.

How do you make equations into compelling drama? Answer You ignore them and go on with the show. The movie begins with a quote from Mickey Mantle about the impossibility of fully understanding baseball from the inside out. ""Moneyball"" never attempts to explain it swiftly navigating around the details of Beanes scheme. Instead director Bennett Miller has produced a warm and generally agreeable character study about the pratfalls of athletic institutions and the willingness to think outside the box. Played by Brad Pitt (also a producer of the project) Beane comes across as a sad-eyed dreamer facing impossible odds. In 2002 having lost star player Johnny Damon and countless others to richer teams he struggles to come up with a plan that avoids compromise and certain failure. His teams paltry 38 million budget trembles in the Yankees 120 million shadow. Eager to get his old time peers to help him find a breakthrough he borders on utter despair when he finds upstart Yale economics grad Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) whose ability to study players numerical data instead of superficial details opens the door for assembling a better team. ""Baseball thinking is medieval"" Brand tells Beane which makes the veteran certain he has found his answer. Scenes of actual gameplay are sparse because ""Moneyball"" is primarily about the obsessive nature of baseballs inner circle of power players. It follows a fairly obvious arc based around Beanes obsession with competition. Miller (utilizing a screenplay that has passed through a few hands most recently Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin) routinely flashes back to Beanes squashed potential as a major league player. Its a tried-and-true device for drawing obvious parallels with his contemporary need to find a winning solution but sufficiently keeps the drama in flux. Shocking his peers with decisions that threaten to doom an already-suffering team Beane faces opposition from field manager Art Howe (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who refuses to use the team in the unorthodox configuration Beane envisions for it. Howe is the closest thing that ""Moneyball"" has to a bad guy and provides enough of an opposition to push Beane over the edge and see his gamble through to the bitter end. The most remarkable thing about ""Moneyball"" is just how swiftly it moves along. Initially set to be directed by Steven Soderbergh who envisioned the adaptation as a hybrid of fictional scenes and documentary interviews it has since been boiled down to a fairly conventional affair. But Miller maintains a fluid pace and highlights extraordinary naturalistic moments (many of which involve backroom strategy sessions). He creates a fully believable universe not only dominated by baseball but defined by it. The scripts only major flaw involves the exploration of Beanes troubled family life; occasional moments with his supportive 12-year-old daughter belong in a different lesser movie. Pitt however looks right at home as a nearly over-the-hill dreamer scavenging for the best success route. Hill whose role might seem like a dubious casting decision based on his existing goofball image actually works quite well in a noticeably muted (but still comically inspired) role. His deadpan expression is the ideal counterpoint to Pitts bubbling enthusiasm for the moneyball game. Hes also a believable mathematical prodigy which allows the movie to avoid cumbersome explanations. Taking a page from ""A Beautiful Mind"" the screenplay sidesteps extensively outlining the process in favor of an enthusiastic montage of equations and algorithms mostly left up to the viewers imagination (unlike the book which apparently delves into the process at great length). In short ""Moneyball"" translates statistics into the formula for a crowdpleaser by simply glossing over them. Although focused on a reinvention of major league rules as commercial entertainment its still the old ballgame. criticWIRE grade B+ HOW WILL IT PLAY? Brad Pitt and baseball are two major ingredients that should result in a winning formula for ""Moneyball"" at the box office although its awards season potential is still unclear.

Throwing the conventional sports-movie formula a curve ""Moneyball"" defies the logic that auds need a rousing third-act championship to clinch their interest. Instead writers Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin resurrect the old adage ""Its not whether you win or lose but how you play the game"" to drive this uncannily sharp penetrating look at how Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane helped reinvent baseball based on statistics rather than near-superstitious thinking. Sparing auds the technicalities but not the spirit of financial reporter Michael Lewis business-of-baseball bestseller ""Moneyball"" should appeal well beyond -- if not always to -- the games fans. Whether or not Hollywood wants to admit it theres an undeniable parallel between big-studio economics and Major League Baseball in which the big guys in both fields are split when it comes to making decisions Old-timers do it for the art basing their judgments on gut instincts and years of tradition while a new class of business-school grads crunch the numbers using statistics to make smart bets. Surely the irony isnt lost on Steven Soderbergh who developed Zaillians script in a more avant-garde direction which would have blended documentary-like interviews with dramatic re-creations. And yet the result -- which puts the focus back on Beane (Brad Pitt) and the Ivy League-educated wunderkind (Jonah Hill) who helped him rewrite the rules -- is plenty artistic with ""Capotes"" Bennett Miller at the helm. Without comparing drafts of the screenplay it would be tricky to say where Zaillians contributions end and Sorkins begin and yet theres no mistaking the latters touch for electric dialogue. As in ""The Social Network"" he takes conversations that have no business being entertaining and leaves us hanging on every word. What ""Moneyball"" doesnt do is waste a lot of time on the field. Its nearly all talk as Beane copes with losing to the New York Yankees in the 2001 playoffs and seeing rich teams poach the As three most valuable players -- Jason Giambi Johnny Damon and Jason Isringhausen. The problem becomes how to assemble a winning team on an impossibly small budget; the solution involves rethinking how baseball scouts evaluate players. In reality that makes for a lot of math. On film Miller manages to explain it by flashing equations and spreadsheets beneath dialogue anyone can grasp. The veteran scouts -- depicted as crusty chaw-spitting geezers -- talk the ""same old good-body crap"" judging players by how they look who they date and how they behave off the field. Beane and Peter Brand (Hill) focus on just one thing OPS or ""on-base plus slugging"" percentage the sabermetric statistic that best describes a players ability to score runs. Depicting more than just the clash of old vs. new the film captures the moment nerds took over what had always been a jocks domain -- all the more fascinating when you consider that Beane who passed on a Stanford scholarship to sign with the New York Mets right out of high school had been a prize athletic specimen back in his day. Strategically timed flashbacks offer glimpses of that talented young hopeful (played by Reed Thompson) meeting with recruiters before striking out in the big leagues. But Sorkin likes to present the theme and then zing it with a line of dialogue as when Athletics scouting director Grady Fuson (Ken Medlock) berates Beane ""Twenty years ago a scout got it wrong and now youre going to declare war on the whole system."" A big enough name to get the movie greenlit (the way Sony chief Amy Pascal not Soderbergh saw it) Pitt sheds any trace of movie-star vanity by allowing himself to be seen as a has-been with a bad haircut. Beane knows hes sticking his neck out by backing Brands numbers-based strategy (the kid based on Paul DePodesta had never even played the game) and yet Beanes job is to give the theory a chance against the objections of manager Art Howe (a surly and skeptical Philip Seymour Hoffman) fully aware that everyone would dismiss their logic if the team were to lose. While a hopelessly awkward-looking Hill provides fish-out-of-water laughs Pitt gives a genuinely soul-searching performance. He reaches for junk food when nervous and questions himself in solitary but his best scenes are those featuring his daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey). During family moments including those featuring his ex-wife (Robin Wright) and her new beau (an uncredited Spike Jonze) Pitt reveals that Beanes swagger is mostly for show and his true nature is far more sensitive than anyone whos seen him cut a player would guess. Of all the scripts ingenious ways to translate the character at the heart of Lewis book none is more inspired than having Casey sing Lenkas ""The Show."" Another approach might have treated the source material as exposition for a more conventional baseball story but ""Moneyball"" is content to draw back the curtain and find drama in the dealings. Millers low-key style suits that strategy nicely breaking up shop-talk scenes with artful quiet moments in which Beane steps away from the action nicely captured by d.p. Wally Pfister. Though Soderberghs talking-heads idea fell by the wayside theresult does employ a fair number of documentary techniques cutting to MLB footage to illustrate the teams on-field performance and featuring a score by Mychael Danna that echoes Philip Glass work on several Errol Morris pics.

Daily Edition Login to download Moneyball Toronto Review 210 PM PDT 9/8/2011 by Kirk Honeycutt FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Sony Pictures A baseball movie for people who dislike the sport as a desperate general manager and an economics grad turn baseball on its head. TWITTER Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill make an unlikely comedy team as they play real-life characters who revolutionized the way big-league baseball people look at their sport. The comparisons to The Social Network arent hard to miss -- the same producers the films writer Aaron Sorkin (along with the estimable Steven Zaillian) and a book about a revolutionary concept that became a game-changer. And yet Moneyball is a different sort of movie. The focus gets split between two male protagonists and the story isnt as electrifying. The Social Network was about a highly unusual alpha dog; Moneyball is the story of a highly unusual underdog. No one remakes the world here. But someone does remake the grand old American game of baseball. And the movie does achieve something nearly impossible Someone who doesnt even like the sport may care about Billy Beane and the 2002 Oakland Athletics. With Brad Pitt playing Billy and Jonah Hill as a Yale economics grad whose analysis of players helps that small-market team reach the playoffs when everyone else writes them off for dead Columbia Pictures looks good perhaps not for a home run but certainly a long double or even an exciting scoot around the bases for a head-first triple. Overseas markets are probably a wash however except in baseball countries such as Japan or certain Latin American nations. PHOTOS 13 Films to Know at the Toronto Film Festival The movie is based on the Michael Lewis book Moneyball The Art of Winning an Unfair Game which explained how Beane an ex-big leaguer and GM of the As put together a playoff team despite having three of his star players lured away by teams brandishing big bucks. He did this not by watching men swing bats or run bases but by looking at reams of statistics that told him which players could produce the most runs while forcing opponents to score the fewest. Its safe to say that few if any GMs today ignore such data. Sorkin and Zaillian however cut through all those equations and mathematical formulas to tell a relatively simple story How a guy with almost no chance of winning develops a secret weapon. This would be a terribly young and highly unathletic Yale grad Peter Brand (Hill) who sees an entirely different game than scouts and coaches do. Where an old-timer sees a guy with a beautiful swing or an ugly girlfriend -- the latter means the player lacks confidence you understand -- Peter looks for a guy with a great on-base percentage. After all more guys on base mean more opportunities to score. Coming off a highly successful 2001 season the As are in Billys words ""organ donors."" The Yankees and the Red Sox teams flush with money flash the cash and scoop up all of Oaklands best players making off with what seems like the heart and brains of the team. But in a rival teams office Billy happens to meet Peter. Having really nothing to lose other than games hes bound to lose anyway he buys into Peters approach to player evaluations. This happens in the movie rather too abruptly but Billy is quite rightly portrayed as an unusual GM. First of all he played the game which few usually have. Then hes a maverick and loner without much relationship skills -- hes divorced and lives only for the game -- or reliance on anyone but himself. He chews tobacco constantly a really filthy habit and pays little attention to opinions unless they coincide with his own. The movie proceeds through the improbable 2002 season with continual flashbacks to Billys own story -- how he was a cant-miss player (played by Reed Thompson who looks uncannily like a young Pitt) who signed for big money rather than accept a Stanford scholarship. But this never works as intended. Since Beane wound up working longer in the game than many of its stars this was hardly a bad decision. There also are attempts to drag in his personal life a wife (Robin Wright) now remarried and a daughter (Kerris Dorsey). These would be superfluous scenes were it not for a winning performance by young Dorsey. The heart of the movie lies in the vindication of Billys big gamble. This gets personified in two characters the teams manager Art Howe played by the magical Philip Seymour Hoffman as a grumpy old man looking out for his own self-interest and Scott Hatteberg (Chris Pratt) a lame-armed catcher transformed into a first baseman to get his terrific on-base percentage into the lineup. Scott is at least as doubtful as his manager but the movie gives you the sense that Beane willed this player -- and this team -- to success. You keep looking for the devil who bought Billys soul but here truly the only devil is in the statistical details. Dont like to see too much baseball you say? Well join Beane. He never watches a game. He stays in the clubhouse catching moments on radio or TV or gets text messages from Peter. So the movie is about a master working behind the scenes like a political strategist or boxing trainer not about the game itself. The scenes between Pitt and Hill are all delights as they struggle to find a working language and then a means to impose their newfound will on the most tradition-minded of sports. Its a great comedy act with Pitt insisting that Hill complete his thoughts or amplify their concepts to the slack-jawed baseball scouts. So the film fits nicely into the realm of The Bad News Bears or Major League of underdogs who shock the world. Director Bennett Miller who coaxed a satisfying movie out of unlikely material with Capote puts Moneyball through a workman-like pace. If the movie fails to achieve the knockout punch of Social Network this may be because another film altogether was originally imagined. Steven Soderbergh was set to direct Zaillians script when Columbia pulled the plug due to concerns with the budget and changes in the original screenplay. One can only wonder what that version would look like as Soderbergh like Beane is not one to do things according to old formulas. Nevertheless this Moneyball stands on its own as a strong rewarding effort to pull unusual personalities and a timeless story from a welter of Inside Baseball.
