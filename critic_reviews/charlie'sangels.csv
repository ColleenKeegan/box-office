"Charlies Angels three bodacious babes one awful director. Slate Sign In Sign Up Charlies Angels three bodacious babes one awful director. Charlies Angels three bodacious babes one awful director. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.June 27 2003 119 PM Fallen Angels Babes? Yes. Director? No. By David Edelstein Full camp It was an ominous sign when star and co-producer Drew Barrymore told the press that the first Charlies Angels picture (2000) was a seat-of-the-pants affair and that this time--in Charlies Angels Full Throttle (Columbia)--the filmmakers really knew what they were doing. I thought ""Oh shit."" I liked the first Charlies Angels --a wittily self-aware Hong Kong-style riff on the old brain-dead TV series. The movie was reportedly a shambles that needed to be thoroughly overhauled in post-production but I didnt mind its slapdash editing which seemed giddily in synch with its leading lady. Barrymore is a gifted comic actress but part of her charm comes from her amateurishness--from her slightly clumsy unsculpted body and her sibilant ""s."" The subtext of the film was Barrymores pipe dream ""Wouldnt it be a blast if someone like me could be a Charlies Angel?"" Advertisement The subtext of Charlies Angels Full Throttle is the punishing megalomania of its director who goes by the name of ""McG""--which could be short for ""Mecha-Godzilla."" McG is a lot more confident this time He wants to make sure you know hes in on the joke even if that means upstaging his own movie. So Full Throttle is full-throttle camp Its like a third-rate AustinPowers picture cut to the whacking attention-deficit-disorder tempo of Moulin Rouge (2001). McG turns every costume change into a rib-cracking nudge and he loves to zoom in on his actresses thighs and cleavage and butt cheeks. But he doesnt trust them to carry any scenes. He chops up their performances and throws in low-comic sound effects and jokey music cues. (When the Angels are drenched by a lawn sprinkler we get B.J. Thomas singing ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head."") The script has a fair amount of funny lines (including an in-joke in which an actor boasts that his latest big-budget action movie must be good--""It had 13 screenwriters"") but McG gives the gags no room to breathe. His jokes are like left hooks to the skull. You dont talk about actors in a movie like this you talk about victims. Chief among them alas is Barrymore who tries too frantically to signal that shes having a great time and who doesnt look so good either. (Shes acted off the screen by Jaclyn Smith whose face is so tight that its a wonder she can even open her mouth.) Hot on Barrymores tail is the new Bosley Bernie Mac who does an all-out minstrel-show turn I cant even bring myself to describe the performance--its in a different sphere of consciousness than his work on television and in movies like Oceans Eleven (2001). Lucy Liu is lucky to get the best lines and to play a handful of scenes with John Cleese as her father whos under the mistaken impression that Charlie is her pimp. If Cleese didnt script these bits himself they were written by someone who studied FawltyTowers and got the rhythms down cold The double-entendres are right on the button. Cameron Diaz is the movies thoroughbred Shes impossible for the camera to violate and her timing shines through in even millisecond bursts. One of the happiest things to happen to movies in the new millennium has been the absence of Demi Moore. Shes baa-ack. You have to admire Moore for going bod-to-bod with Diaz in a string bikini--and her bod looks fine more lithe than it did when she was a teenager. But her face is faintly wizened and her acting cheerless. The last time Moore looked like she was having any fun onscreen was St. Elmos Fire (1985) when she was still a throaty comedian with a touch of baby fat before she developed a steely obsession with selling herself as the Body Beautiful Featuring Hollywoods Most Capacious Tear Ducts. I figured at least she wouldnt cry in a Charlies Angels movie. But her character an ex-Angel has much pent-up resentment toward Charlie and the sound of John Forsythe over the speakerphone is simply too painful to bear. ... Next up for Moore Tosca on Gilligans Island. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

As the brutes advance and as her tied-up hands secretly fiddle with a cigarette lighter she stalls them -- by sticking her legs clad in long black pants right into the air cocking them open like a V (presumably for victory rather than virgin). Holy PG-13 flash The men stop and gawk instinctively halted by the vision of a weapon far superior to their own. After taunting them a bit more Drew stands up in her chair and proceeds to bash twirl and leap demolishing her foes then adding as the coup de grace a sweetly gung-ho ""And thats kickin your ass"" It is indeed. Anyone in pursuit of foxy low-down fun at the movies used to have a choice between good trash and bad trash. Now theres good trash bad trash and snazzy postmodern trash -- high-octane turbo-piffle that acknowledges and winks at its ""sophisticated"" superficiality seducing you with its MTV-age assault merge of eye candy action attitude. If you want humanity go to a video store and rent one of those movies from like the 20th century. If you want synthetically merry James Bond-meets-girl-power kicks go to see Charlies Angels a fizzy fashion-deep tongue-in-cheek thriller thats perhaps the first motion picture to make beating the unholy crap out of bad guys as adorable as it is exciting. The movie reconstitutes the bare bones of the tacky yet revolutionary Aaron Spelling TV series which ran from 1976-81. Like the characters on the show bubblicious Natalie (Cameron Diaz) poker-faced Alex (Lucy Liu) and elfin Dylan (Barrymore) are a luscious trio of hothouse-chicklet undercover agents who work for Charlie a daddy/deity mystery boss who communicates entirely by speaker phone -- a radical concept for the age of Jimmy Carter. Back then the notion of scantily clad pinup crime fighters parading their hot bods feathered locks and perfect teeth through the glare of prime time carried such a blatant cheesecake charge that the show even as it celebrated its heroines weekly victories seemed to be ridiculing the pretense that they were anything more than glassy-eyed human dress-up dolls. In a strange way the entire thrust of Charlies Angels as a pop phenomenon came down to Farrah Fawcett-Majors hair. Long tawny and iron-curled with each strand utterly done the legendary mane which appeared to be as luscious and creamy as sex itself gave her the image of a hippie porn star who had suddenly been made untouchably expensive. It was the first seismic meeting of the sexual revolution and the consumer culture -- the true birth years ahead of its time of the InStyle era. In the movie all that faintly exploitative strut and jiggle has been turned on its head. Natalie Alex and Dylan are boy-crazy girly-girls who go through more costume/identity changes than Barbie and RuPaul combined but the outfit hopping doesnt demean them; it fulfills them. Its now a triumphant gag that when theyre receiving orders from Charlie or playfully ribbing Bosley (Bill Murray) his acerbic lieutenant and go-between their banal enthusiastic chitchat has almost no personality but when they pose as a yodeling-telegram trio of jailbait German maidens in lederhosen all to get a global hotshots retinal impression theyre so knowing in the lustrous self-mockery of their disguise that the joke isnt on them. Its on the entire world of men who can instantly be brought to their knees by the grand mirage of a pretty girl striking a pose. The three Angels are hired to investigate the kidnapping of a wealthy computer techno-nerd played by Sam Rockwell (showing sexy new force as an actor) who turns out to be not quite the puppy he seems. The post-Bondian twists and turns make MI-2 look like Aeschylus yet Charlies Angels as directed by the veteran music-video wizard who bills himself as McG (hows that for a new-millennium fast-food-entertainment moniker?) has been cleverly mapped out so that nearly every encounter -- and some whiz by as quickly as sports-car commercials -- hinges on a different use-your-illusion ruse. The film is a glittering junk pile of disguises high-flying stunts and low-camp romantic ""episodes"" and what holds it all together is the irresistible moxie of its three stars who appear even in the most precarious of circumstances to be having the time of their lives. Barrymore has become a true comedienne-flirt as innocently knowing as Monroe and Lucy Liu as the sternest of the three has a great moment in which she parades through an office like a CEO dominatrix making grateful slaves of her corporate drones. But Charlies Angels is finally Cameron Diazs movie. Her Natalie has a heart as insecure as her body is smokin and the splendor of Diaz is the way those two sides meet in her sun-dappled smile; it says ""Ill melt for you -- if you can handle me"" The films highlight has nothing to do with defeating criminals. Its when Natalie out with a doting bartender (Luke Wilson) takes the stage at Soul Train and starts to gyrate with go-go exuberance to the music. Shes a white girl trying to be ""funky"" utterly failing at it and then when you look again succeeding because her radiance has made her as funky asshe thinks she is. Thats not just an Angel -- thats a star.

"Charlies Angels | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; charlie-s-angels ) Charlies Angels (United States 2000) A movie review by James Berardinelli When Charlies Angels first hit the TV airwaves in the 1976-77 season it was a national phenomenon. Every Wednesday night millions of household sets would be tuned into ABC for the further adventures of the three ""legs"" of millionaire private investigator Charles Townsend. Although the TV program was popular across-the-board it drew its greatest interest from two demographics prepubescent females who saw the Angels as strong role models and post-pubescent males whose interest lay in the Angels other... ahem... assets. For five seasons Charlies Angels flourished before being consigned forever to rerun limbo. The original Angels - the three best remembered by TV viewers old enough to have watched the show during its initial run - were Farrah Fawcett Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith. Of them only Smith stayed with the show through its entire run. Fawcett despite being inextricably linked to the program was only on for one season. After a public salary dispute she was replaced by Cheryl Ladd. Jackson departed after three seasons first to be replaced by Shelly Hack for season 4 then by Tanya Roberts for season 5 when Hack failed to capture the publics interest. To date Roberts is the only actress to have the dubious distinction of being both an Angel and a Bond girl. With all of the changes that went on during the series five-year run its no surprise that 20 years later Charlie has a new group of Angels doing his bidding. (Plans for cameos by the original trio were scratched when Fawcett wanted a bigger role than the other two and Jackson refused to appear.) Charlies Angels approaches its subject matter in much the same way that The Brady Bunch Movie did. With tongue planted firmly in cheek for the entire 98-minute running length the film simultaneously pays homage to and makes fun of the first television show to have gotten dads and daughters to bond in front of the set. Charlies Angels is designed camp - a movie that openly acknowledges its dubious appeal and revels in it. However unlike The Brady Bunch Movie Charlies Angels doesnt outstay its welcome. Theres something delightfully refreshing about a brainless movie that teases audiences with jiggle and cleavage blows up every combustible object on the screen and gleefully overuses Matrix-style martial arts combat sequences. Youd have to be a hopeless curmudgeon not to be entertained on some juvenile level by this motion picture. It works precisely because it has no illusions about what it is or the audience whose attention its trying to arrest. There is a plot - not that the specifics matter much. The current group of Angels - blond Natalie (Cameron Diaz) busty Dylan (Drew Barrymore) and leather-loving Alex (Lucy Liu) - are summoned to the Townsend Detective Agency building by Bosley (Billy Murray in the role originated by the late David Doyle). There speaking from a remote location the disembodied Charlie (voice of John Forsythe - the only returning participant from the TV series) informs his employees about their new assignment. Their client Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch) has suffered a catastrophic loss - her best friend and boss the genius behind Knox Electronics has been kidnapped presumably by his chief rival the dastardly Roger Corwin (Tim Curry). The Angels are to save Knox (Sam Rockwell) and recover the stolen technology Corwin has hidden deep in an ultra-secret vault. There are of course obstacles (too numerous to mention) the most dangerous of which is a silent unbalanced killer played with single-minded determination by the always-loopy Crispin Glover. Its hard to say whether Charlies Angels contains more action scenes or flashes of flesh. Regardless both are present in abundance. For the latter there are numerous shots of Barrymore and Diaz with plunging necklines and undone buttons. We see the three stripping off wetsuits but only from the back and only to a point (this is after all a PG-13 movie). Finally in a scene that will have teenage boys everywhere using the stop-motion control on the DVD player when the movie arrives on disc Barrymore takes a nude tumble down a hillside - although shes moving a little too fast and the light is a little too dim for us to make out anything clearly. As for the fight scenes of which there are nearly a dozen all borrow heavily from The Matrix (with an occasional nod to more traditional martial arts moves). The Angels leap incredible distances into the air landing with spine-crushing force on their opponents chests then dodge the occasional speeding bullet. This sort of overblown combat is fun to watch although it pales in comparison with the breathtaking lengths to which director Ang Lee takes it in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Still this visceral fun makes for edible eye candy. The films director making his feature debut goes by the moniker of ""McG"" (short for Joseph McGinty Mitchell). He pumps up the visual and audio volume making Charlies Angels a kinetic experience even during the few ""slow"" sequences. His approach arguably perfect for music videos works with this material because of its nature. Fast cuts and visual jokes (such as the ""hair flip"") work in a movie like this; they might be distracting in something of a more serious nature. His choice of music is intriguing mixing 70s songs (most with the word ""angel"" in the title ""Angel of the Morning"" ""Heaven Must Be Missing an Angel"" ""Undercover Angel"") and 00 heavy metal into a soundtrack that never gears down. Fortunately the actors are all in synch with the material. None of them tries to play things too seriously or too broadly. Barrymore in addition to being one of the driving forces behind getting the movie made is arguably the most luminous of the stars. Diaz borrows liberally from her Theres Something About Mary character although she appears (for lack of a better term) a little washed out. Liu who reportedly was the cause of on-set tension is at her best when playing the part of a dominatrix disciplining a room full of sun-deprived engineers. As Bosley Bill Murrays talents are underused but this isnt Bosley and the Angels. Tim Curry and Crispin Glover fit perfectly into this kind of cast with Kelly Lynch Luke Wilson Sam Rockwell and Tom Green (a.k.a. Mr. Drew Barrymore) filling out the roster. Feminists have always debated the merits of Charlies Angels - whether it deals in female exploitation or empowerment. This movie certainly isnt going to resolve the issue since theres plenty of both going on. It is enjoyable however to encounter an action movie where the heroes are all female (a rare breed indeed). Ultimately however Charlies Angels is far too light to promote any sort of serious or introspective discussion - and rightfully so. Anything else would have been a disappointment and a waste. The movie is exactly what it needs to be to succeed trashy dumb and flashy - in short one of the guiltiest pleasures to reach multiplexes this year.

Publicity photo FALLEN `ANGELS / Crime-fighting women play it goofy in disastrous updating of TV show 1 / 2 Back to Gallery CHARLIES ANGELS Action. Starring Cameron Diaz Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. Directed by McG. (PG-13. 92 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) It says something that 20 years after the series ""Charlies Angels"" went to TV heaven a new movie can come along that makes the show look like the height of creativity imagination and restraint. Thats exactly what has happened with ""Charlies Angels"" an utter debacle starring Cameron Diaz Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu. How could they screw this up? Take three pretty women. Knock out a decent detective story. Give them a chance to show off their looks and personality . . . it doesnt take much more than that. Sure to make a great film out of this material would be difficult. But to make a repellent film out of ""Charlies Angels"" would require a lack of talent as rare in its way as genius. Unfortunately the producers found a genius. He goes by the name McG. Hes a video and commercial director making his disas trous feature debut with this film. From the evidence on screen it would seem he prepared for the picture by watching the movie version of ""The Avengers"" over and over. ""Charlies Angels"" is a film that never seems to start. It plays like a coming-attractions trailer or a rock video. Its done in quick takes flashes bits of scenes that are intended to register as arch or snappy. But they dont register at all except as overly stylized and self-conscious. The first casualty of this strategy is the individuality of the three women. Their disparate appeal should have been the main kick of the movie. Twenty years ago after all everyone had a favorite Angel just as in the 60s everyone had a favorite Beatle. But in the film it was the directors deliberate strategy according to publicity to make the women ""very similar."" Well he succeeded. Theyre a trio of ciphers. Lucy Liu survives because she has an appealing gravity on screen. She also has the least to do. Drew Barrymore survives because shes Drew Barrymore and can do no wrong in front of a camera. But Cameron Diaz who has the most screen time is demolished. Someone must have told Diaz that she looks really adorable when she smiles in close-up. That person was not her friend. Bill Murray appears as Bosley who coordinates the Angels activities and deals directly with Charlie (voice of John Forsythe). Here as elsewhere whenever Murray appears on screen the audience gets ready to laugh. ""Ready"" is as close as it gets. The film gives Murray nothing to do and nothing to play off of. It could be anybody up there. The story such as it is involves the theft of voice-tracing equipment by an international corporation run by Corwin played by Tim Curry (another flashy talent the movie inexplicably fails to exploit). The Angels are hired by one of the inventors of the technology (Kelly Lynch) who wants to find her kidnapped partner (Sam Rockwell). Lynch blows the Angels off the screen something that could not have been the filmmakers intent. She comes off as the only attractive intelligent and interesting woman in the picture. The Angels look like goofy girls. The Angels goofiness is a big disappointment second only to the shocking ineptitude of McG. Once upon a time ""Charlies Angels"" was considered a sexist show -- a form of ""jiggle"" TV -- that looked for ways to get the women into bathing suits every week. It says something about the past two decades that the TV Angels now look like feminist paragons next to the new trio. True the TV Angels may have had to show off their bodies but they seemed like adult women who could speak in complete sentences and hold their own at a dinner party. The new Angels represent the worst of both worlds Theyre not at all sexy and yet the film exploits them. The endless repeated shots of Diazs spiderlike rear end for exam ple starts off as tiresome graduates into embarrassing and eventually borders on painful. Why is this woman smiling? ""Charlies Angels"" is clearly intended as the beginning of a female action franchise. The only good news is that the franchise has nowhere to go but up. -- Advisory This film contains violence and sexual situations. ..

Packed with action attitude skin-tight costumes and enough dazzling white smiles and slo-mo hair flips for a seasons worth of toothpaste and shampoo commercials this entertaining confection possesses the substance of the TV show the pacing of a Hong Kong actioner and the production values of a James Bond thriller. And it is the somewhat younger equivalent of the vast audience that Bond films reliably draw upon that Sony will capture with this broadly appealing romp with extra potential repped by teenage girls and boys who may keep coming back for more in theaters and at home until a sequel is ready. As it was with Farrah Fawcett Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson (and later Cheryl Ladd Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts) on TV from 1976-81 the babes are the thing here and it will be the rare viewer male and female who wont enjoy the sheer visual and visceral pleasure of watching Cameron Diaz Drew Barrymore and Lucy Liu strut slink kick dance and vamp their way through this splashy femme empowerment fantasy. What with this and Ang Lees similarly female-slanted ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" poised to dominate the action market through the holidays slighted-feeling boys may start wanting to get some of their own back. In the meantime however few will complain that they arent getting their jollies from the outlandish mayhem served up in both pictures. ""Charlies Angels"" presents its bigscreen credentials in the opening seconds zeroing in unconventionally on the clouds in the Columbia Pictures logo to reveal a jet endangered by an on-board bomber. This breezy very Bond-like teaser which begins at 35000 feet and ends with the three Angels zooming along the Pacific coastline in a speedboat establishes the films energetic physicality as well as its cheerful mildly self-referential tone (one character complains when the in-flight attraction is revealed to be ""another movie based on an old TV show""-""T.J. Hooker The Movie""). Nor does it take long for the first-time feature director known as McG (a commercials and music video whiz kid) to announce that he has no intention of presenting a single shot that doesnt provoke some kind of special surface stimulation. In this he is greatly aided by Diaz Barrymore and Liu who appear respectively as Natalie Dylan and Alex three young ladies who are not only gorgeous sexy and fun but can do just about anything except find men who are anywhere near their level. Working for the reclusive millionaire Charlie (voiced as ever by John Forsythe) the gals team with their immediate supervisor Bosley (Bill Murray) in taking on the case of Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell) a young high-tech genius who has been kidnapped. Falling immediately under suspicion is Roger Corwin (Tim Curry) a satellite communications kingpin who could conceivably use Knoxs invention -- voice-identification software thats more reliable than fingerprinting -- for his own nefarious ends. Its the usual potential-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it action thriller format this time featuring bad guys brandishing guns and swords being regularly bested by babes blessed with gravity-defying martial arts skills. Latter abilities come into play about a half-hour in as the Angels take on Corwins skinny silent blade-wielding henchman (Crispin Glover) en route to locating Knox. While the spectacle of the three women executing wire-enabled leaps jumps flips kicks and other maneuvers -- under the supervision of Cheung-Yan Yuen the ""Master"" of ""The Matrix"" and innumerable Hong Kong actioners -- is enjoyable its nothing thats not been seen before and has not been shot and particularly edited for maximum effectiveness; there are too many cuts in these sequences giving the impression of something thats been stitched together rather than of fluid motion thats all of a piece. All the same it still beats Tom Cruise trying to be a kung fu star in ""Mission Impossible 2."" Script by Ryan Rowe (""Tapeheads"") Ed Solomon (""Men in Black"" the ""Bill amp; Ted"" duo) and John August (""Go"") is divided into three half-hour segments each with its own climax which gives the picture the feel of three TV episodes played back-to-back-to-back not a bad thing under the circumstances. With Knox rescued to conclude the first seg second round is kicked off by a Formula One car race between Natalie and Glovers baddie that quickly leaves the track and continues on public roads. Pics literally high-flying initial nature then becomes more earthbound as the girls employ a variety of disguises and technological tricks to enter the massively protected mainframe of Corwins master computer in the hopes of discovering whether or not hes actually taken possession of Knoxs software. Middle section also provides some downtime for a little Ramp;R Dylan enjoys a little sack action with the initially nerdy Knox Alex hangs out with her earnest actor b.f. Jason (Matt LeBlanc) and the ever-enthusiastic Natalie does a feature dance at a retro Soul Trail club while on a first date with puppyish waiter Pete (Luke Wilson). Even the reticent Bosley is romanced by Knoxs aggressive business partner Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch). But neither of the high-tech entrepreneurs is what they appear to be and final half-hour is devoted to the Angels urgent rescue of Bosley from a cliffside tower which involves some pretty good mano a mano between Natalie and Vivian and the exciting thwarting of the villains airborne attempt to take out the reclusive Charlie at his secret oceanside retreat. Pics buoyant style is set and sustained in equal measure by the leading players and by the production team. Of the three women Diaz is indisputably the dazzler; with her long limbs beach-blond hair lagoon-blue eyes milewide smile and shimmying booty she all but pops off the screen as if in 3-D and rarely has a performer conveyed the impression of being so happy to be in a particular movie. Co-producer Barrymore attractively plays the most sexual of the threesome in a way thats both teasing and demure and is also the only one supplied with anything resembling a psychological dimension -- she never knew her father hence her job working for a man shes never met. Lius approach is more serious and conventional and therefore makes less of a distinctive impression. Murray applies his usual sardonic edge to the demands of some straightforward clowning to make something out of his limited opportunities while Rockwell Lynch Curry and Glover make well-defined evildoers. Above all McG supplies the action with endless juice. But he also knows how to frame and move the camera and the pedal-to-the-metal approach is whats called for given that the material is as substantial as Perrier bubbles. It was also wise to keep the running time of the film proper down to scarcely more than 90 minutes. As resplendently lensed by Russell Carpenter pic has a rich studio look even though much of it was shot on location. J. Michael Rivas production design and Joseph G. Aulisis costumes combine modest elements of 70s kitsch without relying on retro recognition for laughs and the combination of Edward Shearmurs score and snippets of 39 pop tunes keeps the soundtrack popping.

"Review Angels amp; Demons has its blessings - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Angels amp; Demons has its blessingsStory Highlights""Angels amp; Demons"" is full of hooey but its slickly done hooeyStar Tom Hanks director Ron Howard lead way to put Dan Browns book on screenFilm makes little sense but enjoyable nonethelessNext Article in Entertainment >> Read VIDEO By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- Critics and Catholics were quick to denounce Ron Howards faithfully irreligious film of Dan Browns ""The Da Vinci Code"" when it was released almost exactly three years ago. Tom Hanks and Ayelet Zurer wonder what in heaven is going on in a scene from ""Angels amp; Demons."" The public went anyway It made three-quarters of a billion dollars worldwide. Now we get the movie of Browns previous page-turner ""Angels amp; Demons"" again from the slightly fusty Howard-Tom Hanks combination. This time church members should be mollified by the films more tempered line on ecclesiastical affairs. But moviegoers may be less forgiving of its implausible plotting and tendency to pontificate on arcane -- and likely specious -- historical footnotes. Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have taken some liberties with the source beginning with the time frame which is set a year or so after the momentous revelations about Marys bloodline. (Face it Toms not getting any younger.) Apparently the Catholic Church withstood that bombshell only to stumble into a more urgent crisis with the unexpected death of a progressive pope and the subsequent kidnapping of four cardinals on the eve of the conclave to elect his successor. Not only that the kidnappers claim to belong to a secret sect the ""Illuminati"" and promise to kill their captives at hourly intervals before the day is done a bloody countdown to the midnight destruction of the church itself. Watch Tom Hanks address the films controversy >> As Ray Parker Jr. put it ""Who you gonna call?"" With the clock ticking and a missing canister of antimatter () to further concentrate wavering minds Vatican emissaries show up at Professor Robert Langdons door. The symbologist immediately embarks on what looks like a wild goose chase criss-crossing Rome Italy with willing physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer) and a dwindling cadre of suspicious Vatican guards in tow. Dont Miss Angels amp; Demons actors What controversy? In better shape than he was in ""The Da Vinci Code"" -- hes introduced with a lengthy swimming workout to prove it -- and evidently no longer troubled with claustrophobia Langdon is still a more cerebral scholar-hero than his peers Indiana Jones and ""National Treasures"" Ben Gates. Its telling that he passes out right in the middle of his biggest action scene and hes a bystander when it comes time to defuse a deadly time bomb ceding the spotlight to Ewan McGregors dashing Camerlengo McKenna a flying padre. Weird then that Langdon also seems wanting when it comes to his academic credentials. Despite his professional interest in history religion and code-breaking he struggles with Latin and hasnt mastered Italian. Standards are obviously slipping at Harvard. He is quick on the uptake though and navigates Romes famously stagnant traffic at lightning speed -- albeit invariably arriving fractionally too late to save the kidnapped clerics from grisly ""Seven""-like deaths each opportunistically themed to one of the four classical elements. The race-against-time scenario is preposterous and not only in retrospect but the movie is crisp and compelling if you let it gloss over your own powers of deduction. The pictures real star is the production design. The Catholic Church barred the filmmakers from several key locations (not unreasonably in the circumstances) but you would never know it. Its impossible to tell which were shot on site and which were recreated digitally. The encroaching darkness is carefully developed in Salvatore Totinos atmospheric cinematography and the climactic son et lumiere show is genuinely impressive to behold. iReport.com A- for ""Angels amp; Demons"" Efficiently acted by pros such as Armin Mueller Stahl and Stellan Skarsgaard ""Angels amp; Demons"" smacks of a macabre mystery tour of Roman art and architecture with Tom Hanks as our informative but paranoid guide. Its not great cinema but high hokum. The melodramatic climax is more hysterical than historical. Still Howard brings us home on blind faith and sheer nerve which may prompt a few moviegoers to utter hosannas. ""Angels amp; Demons"" is rated PG-13 and runs 138 minutes.
