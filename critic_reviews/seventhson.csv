Comments click to enlarge Seventh Son An IMAX 3D Experience Video Rated PG-13  102 minutes  2015 This Lord of the Rings knockoff is superior to any of Peter Jacksons Tolkein adaptations in that its over in less than two hours; otherwise its a loud joyless mess. In a mythical land an aging witch hunter (Jeff Bridges) trains a new apprentice to help him battle a powerful demon (Julianne Moore) who wants to rule the world. Moore has never looked so uncomfortable onscreen though no one else in the impressive cast--which features Olivia Williams Djimon Hounsou and Alicia Vikander (A Royal Affair)--fares much better. Director Sergey Bodrov never establishes a clear tone; the dramatic scenes carry little emotional charge and the attempts at comic relief fall flat.

"Seventh Son | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; seventh-son ) Seventh Son (USA/UK/Canada 2014) February 06 2015 A movie review by James Berardinelli Had Seventh Son been released in the 1980s it would have been deemed an adequate - perhaps even good - fantasy adventure. However in the three decades since Conan the Barbarian and Dragonslayer defined the genres best big screen attempts there have been significant changes. Fantasy fans demand complexity - something they have gotten from Harry Potter The Lord of the Rings and (on TV) Game of Thrones. By-the-numbers generic plots no longer work and that unfortunately is what Seventh Son delivers. Impressive set design and visuals excessive CGI and a loud score from Marco Beltrami cant fully compensate for bland character development and a predictable narrative that rushes along on a linear trajectory. Ben Barnes whos no stranger to fantasy due to his role as Prince Caspian in a couple of the Narnia films takes the lead. Hes the ""seventh son of a seventh son"" which makes him destinys child to fill the role of the ""Spooks apprentice."" Said Spook is Master Gregory (Jeff Bridges) the last of a warrior profession dedicated to the eradication of witches. When he takes Tom Ward (Barnes) away from his dear mother (Olivia Williams) the situation is dire wicked witch Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore) has returned from a long span in captivity and is set upon fulfilling certain megalomaniacal desires. Her power will reach its apex with the arrival of the full blood moon and Master Gregory and Tom have that long to stop her. Complicating matters is the arrival into Toms world of Alice (Alicia Vikander) the fated love of his life - who happens to be both a witch and Mother Malkins niece. Seventh Son feels a little like Clash of the Titans (without the mythological backstory or character names) in that it introduces a lot of big ugly CGI monsters for Gregory and Tom to fight. There are dragons giants ghasts and a variety of other things culled from the Dungeons amp; Dragons Monster Manual. The plot is essentially a standard-order quest to eliminate the Big Bad Boss before she becomes unstoppable. Along the way Tom evolves from being a pig keeper (a nod to The Book of Three?) into someone with Real Purpose. Call it the Luke Skywalker arc although it was a lot more entertaining in 1977 when it happened a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. Barnes performance is suitably bland - hes handsome but there isnt much of a character for him to inhabit so hes forced to get by on good looks and limited charm. Alicia Vikander is equally photogenic but like Barnes the script doesnt demand much from her. Julianne Moore manages to go over-the-top without being completely ridiculous. Shes about to win an Oscar but definitely not for roles like this. Then theres the strange case of Jeff Bridges who seems to be cannibalizing the ""work"" he did in R.I.P.D. Thats not a good thing; its as if he got lost on the way to an audition for a remake of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. His interpretation of Master Gregory is what one might expect for a Drunk Gandalf or Drunk Dumbledore. Very strange indeed. Seventh Son based on the novel The Spooks Apprentice by Joseph Delaney probably achieves what director Sergei Bodrov intended. The problem is that Bodrovs ambition extends no further than providing audiences with snacks of visual awe. The cities of this medieval land are impressive the monsters are menacing and the magical displays are eye-catching but it all feels rather hollow in the end. The movie didnt bore me but neither did it draw me in the way good fantasy should. The films failings seem to be rooted in commonly held misperceptions about what a mainstream fantasy film should be like. The genre is at its best when it excites the imagination; it would be hard to qualify Seventh Son as either ""exciting"" or ""imaginative.""

Photo Warner Bros and Legendary Pictures Why is it so hard to make a satisfying medieval fantasy adventure? We look down on movies likeA Seventh SonA Season of the WitchA Outcast and any number of other films for their descent into high camp but sometimes one wonders if its the genre. With its overt appeals to such childlike (or childish depending on your point of view) things like dragons and witches and spells maybe its just hard to take this stuff at face value anymore unless it was written by J.R.R. Tolkien (and even then sometimes its hard). Has it really been more than three decades since Ladyhawke and Dragonslayer? Was it just a more innocent time back then? Even soA Seventh Son doesnt appear to have had much of a chance. A strange movie that manages to be both ridiculous and bland its chief point of interest is the spectacle of a great actor caught in career decline. As Gregory a former knight and witch-hunter who wanders the countryside fighting and exorcising demons of all stripes Jeff Bridges is pure growly silliness giving a performance that is somehow both debased and yet above it all. Gregory enlists restless Skywalker-y village kid Tom (Ben Barnes) as his apprentice. Not just anyone can be an apprentice mind; it must be a seventh son of a seventh son. (Or as Gregory puts it a ""sheventh shaun of a sheventh shaun."") Being an apprentice isnt easy either. You have to muster up the courage to kill your prisoners; a wrong move or the slightest hesitation can get you incinerated as happened to Gregorys last apprentice. And whats with these visions Toms been having? ""You live in a world now where legends and nightmares are real"" Gregory tells him. Anyway despite the promise of wonders beyond our wildest dreams thoroughly generic life lessons and much CGI-inflected action follow as Tom Gregory and their beastly Hulk-like sidekick Tusk (John DeSantis) hunt Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore) a queen witch who is about to destroy the world and who clearly has some sort of past with Gregory. Meanwhile Tom falls for Alice (Alicia Vikander) a half-witch whose heart is good but whos divided in her loyalties. Along the way there are some nice creature effects -- not realistic mind you but just imaginative enough to make us occasionally snap to attention. Director Sergei Bodrov has actually made some good films the Oscar-nominated Prisoner of the Mountains being one; he keeps the action clean but lifeless. Theres a hint of an idea here with all the crossed allegiances going on; I havent read Joseph Delaneys young-adult novel The Spooks Apprentice in which Tom is apparently an impressionable 12-year-old and not a strapping 20-something hunk of nothing but I wouldnt be surprised if it does more with Gregory and Malkins background or with Alice and Toms divided identities.A At one point Tom wonders what monsters have nightmares about. ""Humans probably"" comes the reply. The film keeps wanting to go in interesting directions but it has neither the guts nor the imagination nor the energy to do so. Seventh Son not only offers no new spin on its bland by-the-numbers story it also fails to deliver any generic pleasures; Im not sure this movie could even keep a young child engaged. Its hard to pinpoint exactly where the problems began. Bridges and Moore ham it up but each in conflicting ways Shes clearly enjoying the chance to play a sneering shrieking villain while he seems on a whole other plain of cant-be-bothered goofiness. I have no idea where Bridgess ridiculous accent comes from; my best guess is that hes so embarrassed by this movie that hes trying to convince us thats really Sean Connery behind all that facial hair. Maybe he cared once. The Seventh Son has reportedly been in production and post- for five years so maybe it has just been nitpicked and second-guessed and tested and retested and revised into oblivion. It sure feels like the demons have gotten to this movie. Theyve drained it of life and then theyve drained it some more.

"Star Wreck The Noble Badness of the Wachowskis Jupiter Ascending Trumps the Abominable Seventh Son << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Star Wreck The Noble Badness of the Wachowskis Jupiter Ascending Trumps the Abominable Seventh Son Warner Bros. Movies February 6 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print We consumers of American popular culture have accepted the virtues of certain kinds of badness. We know camp and kitsch and trash. Empire on Fox is currently medaling in all three events. The badness on that show or any soap opera sublimates the gutter into glamour. Thats easy. Earnest honest-to-goodness this-is-who-I-really-am badness is of a different order of magnitude in which the artist (its an art by the way) risks eternal embarrassment -- or least permanent skepticism -- in order to say something personal. Think of the so-called Kimye marriage project or Robin Thicke on his album Paula last summer earnestly nakedly bad. So when two filmmakers decide to send an assimilated Russian immigrant who scrubs toilets in Chicago into an outer-space action-adventure pay attention. Why? Because her name is Jupiter Jones and shes played by Mila Kunis instead of I dont know Pam Grier. Because Caine Wise the bleach-blond goat-eared leather-clad tracker whos surfing her there -- via rockets in his boots -- appears to be part man part farm animal part West Hollywood rent boy. Because these two have fallen in love and cant get up. Because love is the only navigable emotion in a swampy epic production that not only destroys downtown Chicago but is considerate enough -- unlike say the average Michael Bay movie -- to rebuild it instantly. The two filmmakers are Lana and Andy Wachowski. Their new movie Jupiter Ascending mixes sleepiness and excitement Channing Tatum and Eddie Redmayne emotional clarity and narrative confusion too much and not enough. The universe is endless Earth is but a coveted pebble and Jupiter Jones is we eventually learn a ""recurrence."" Her genetic profile has caught the attention of three millennia-old siblings in some other galaxy Balem (Redmayne) Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) and Titus (Douglas Booth). After their mothers scandal-shrouded death they now lead the House of Abrasax a name that conjures images of the warring factions from the masterpiece documentary Paris Is Burning in which the House of LaBeija could be counted on to do battle against the House of Chanel. What the movie lacks in drag balls it makes up for in chaotic shootouts chase sequences and Redmaynes impersonation of a deathbed Andy Warhol sniping with Booths seemingly ambisexual boy-bitch. Balem is enough of a high-maintenance individualist to make you think the dead mother is actually Ayn Rand. The recurrence in question is that of Mother Abrasax who has bequeathed our solar system to these three. Jupiter appears to share her genes making her royal too -- and therefore powerful and as entitled to dynastic spoils. So Titus has dispatched Caine (Tatum) to bring her to him. But a gang of Balem-affiliated bounty hunters is also on the scene which is how you wind up with action sequences set amid alleyway fire escapes and in a cornfield. Upon exiting my wearied delight with Jupiter Ascending coexisted with pure bafflement. (Did a black woman in the form of a chariot truly transport Redmayne to an event? I believe a black woman did do that.) But I exited knowing that Id seen a movie no other filmmaker could have made. Jupiter Ascending is about heeding cosmic and genetic destiny and it is of a piece with what the Wachowskis believe is their artistic destiny the fight against human vacuousness and their belief in the fight to become who you know you are rather than who youve been programmed to be. Jupiter Ascending and their previous film Cloud Atlas are the first since Lana Wachowski came out as transgender and now their ponderousness has a loose sloshing crazy quality. Their filmmaking seems in its way free. In the pursuit of some higher truth the Wachowskis have perfected earnest badness. The plot here rehashes the ideas of human exploitation in the three increasingly overwrought Matrix films and the belief in reincarnation from Cloud Atlas but with less surprise. Ideas fuel the plot but the movie is incoherent from set piece to set piece. Its not arguing as passionately as the other four movies especially Cloud Atlas which is as absurdly optimistic a vision of race and identity in the movies as youll ever see. The Wachowskis are committed to questioning the complacency of identity like that Henry Louis Gates discover-your-roots show or TLCs Who Do You Think You Are? -- which really should be called How Black Is This Very Famous Person? The Matrix trilogy and Cloud Atlas made space-time odysseys out of struggle against a kind of predeterminism. There is no struggle in Jupiter Ascending just a lot of handsome pomp and noise and makeup and costumes and production. (Here the actors of color -- like Gugu Mbatha-Raw Nikki Amuka-Bird and Bae Doona -- show up ornamentally for two or three short scenes as help and hindrance then vanish.) Its fabulousness is ultimately in the service of itself. Also Lana and Andy lack the contrasting coconspirator they had on Cloud Atlas in Tom Tykwer a director who brings different heat and speed and navigability to his movies. It must be said as well that Jupiter Ascending falls under so many influences -- Terry Gilliam George Lucas Luc Besson The Wizard of Oz Carl Sagan 2001 A Space Odyssey Tom Hulce in Amadeus Bjork on the cover of Homogenic -- that all the visions blur and compete. After a while youre watching a malfunctioning kaleidoscope as much as a movie. Theres no outside source material to push back against the way there was with David Mitchells novel in Cloud Atlas. Thats probably why you wind up with sulking transparent dialogue like ""The more you care the more the world tries to find ways to punish you for it."" But there are moments of loveliness along the way such as when Caine and Jupiter show up at the farm of an earthbound fellow tracker (Sean Bean) whose farmhouse is infested with bees that seem to defer to Jupiter. Theres another in which Balem in his space palace has paused a replay of Caines rescue of Jupiter from his hunters and you cant take your eyes off of Tatum floating in an amniotic state up toward the right-hand corner of the screen. Weve now been trained to watch a Wachowski movie looking for state-of-the-art technology to achieve a milestone in the way the first two Matrix movies did. A moment like that doesnt seem like much. But with a movie thats available in 3-D that slowest-motion shot provides a reason to want to touch the screen. The scenes of Tatum power-skating and surfing across the sky and away from the films many infernos are oddly magical. Getting around that way looks hard and Tatum doesnt look embarrassed to be pretending to do it. He looks soulfully committed to the exertion of all that energy. Hes better here than he is in something like Foxcatcher which needs an actor who can tell you whats going on even when his lips arent moving. Hes one of those stars whos better in motion with physical work to do. He almost never stops moving here. Kunis is a different story. Shes the coolest least urgent actor Ive ever seen running from explosions and raining debris. Its as if she wants you to know its all make-believe to see the green screen. In the action sequences shes working against the siblings humanity mission. She wants you to know shes a prop. As for the Wachowskis what youre looking for in all of these crashing styles and amid all the grand earnestness is some sense theyre moving too -- forward toward something new to do. Here its outright comedy. The sequence in which Jupiters royal credentials have to be confirmed is a brief excursion into bureaucratic farce. Its a marvelous sequence in which the editing acting and camera placement just make you laugh as does Gilliam who shows up for a self-tributing cameo. More of that sort of filmmaking please Lana and Andy. Still it remains odd watching them work with the loose caricatured reality of everyday people without the immediate coating of science fiction as they do in the dining-table sequences with Jupiter and her big Russian family. Its as if to them normal folks are from outer space. Jupiter mentions that shes got a date and the table erupts with excitement. ""Is he Russian?"" ""Is he rich?"" ""Whats his sign?"" Its like the foreplay not for a space opera but for a movie genre on a faraway planet the Wachowskis should consider exploring the musical.  Sometimes you get halfway through a movie and you cant believe that what youre seeing made its way from Los Angeles or someones Los Angeles computer to where youre sitting. Its so dreary dumb and brutally dull. You cant believe that no one thought to ask whether itd be fun to watch Jeff Bridges and his apprentice Ben Barnes defeat a parade of villains played by women and people of color who can turn into killer beasts. This isnt the worst thing about Seventh Son. The worst thing is that it exists at all. But it says a lot that no one thought to give Julianne Moore and Djimon Hounsou for starters more to do than vamp and growl. The plot requires Barnes led by the sorcerer a ""spook"" played by Bridges to track down a powerful gemstone that has fallen into the hands of Moores dark witch. Theres an enchanted girl (Alicia Vikander) for Barnes to fall in love with. Yes its one of those medieval-ish romance-fantasy plots. It wouldnt be such a chore to sit through if the movie were made with any sense of pacing or care. Its designed to get a franchise going. Actual entertainment tends to feel very much beside the point. These are grim times for staging action sequences. The barnyard finale for instance of The Boy Next Door looks as if its been staged by the animals. As directed by Sergei Bodrov the combat in Seventh Son is quick and indecipherable and indifferent. You get better stuntmanship in two or three hours of a professional wrestling broadcast. For all that doesnt work about the Wachowskis movie you never get the sense the siblings dont believe in what theyre doing. Bridges Moore and Hounsou for his couple of scenes at least proceed with little concern for embarrassment. They are professionals. Bridges no longer seems to care what an audience will think. Even when hes just lazily doing Sean Connery in Highlander and Richard Harris in almost everything he is really just doing The Dude. The fun of Redmayne in Jupiter Ascending is that his hammy villainy can be played against the prevailing nobility of the larger exercise. Seventh Son leans hard on its stars shamelessness but after a while you wish they had a little more shame.

BOTTOM LINE No masterpiece but a welcome February surprise with a lively cast and rugged action. CAST Jeff Bridges Ben Barnes Julianne Moore LENGTH 142 You may not be expecting much from the supernatural action-adventure film ""Seventh Son"" and clearly neither is Universal Pictures which has consigned the movie to the wintry graveyard of February. The movie is rather familiar-looking with its dragons demons come-hither witches and Jeff Bridges playing a bearded guru. It will surprise no one to learn that ""Seventh Son"" is based on a young-adult novel ""The Last Apprentice"" by Joseph Delaney. As it happens ""Seventh Son"" is a good example of what can happen when you assemble enough talent under one roof. The cast is strong and includes Julianne Moore clearly enjoying herself as Mother Malkin a dark queen who swans around like Joan Crawford in feathered shoulder pads. The Russian director Sergei Bodrov (1997s Oscar-nominated Tolstoy adaptation ""Prisoner of the Mountains"") breathes life into the action even when his screen is covered with computer-animated beasties. The screenwriting team includes Steven Knight whose dialogue-driven drama ""Locke"" was a critical smash last year. advertisement | advertise on newsday Does all this add up to excellence? No but ""Seventh Son"" is not bad and sometimes even reaches good. Its hero is Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) whose mystical birth order makes him the ideal apprentice for Master Gregory (Bridges) a witch-hunter known as The Spook. Barnes Tom is appealingly smart and has a stiff spine and even though Bridges is basically playing a Zen surfer in medieval garb the two actors develop an easy comfortable rapport. Theres also a youthful romance between Tom and a mysterious girl Alice (Alicia Vikander) that feels convincingly sweet and urgent. Olivia Williams adds a note of tenderness as Toms mother. What ""Seventh Son"" lacks is a new angle on an old world. Weve already seen just about everything here from the ancient amulet to the grunting monsters. Helping compensate though are the rough action scenes a few dark emotional shadows and an overall intelligence that shines through the special effects. ""Seventh Son"" may not become the franchise it hopes to be but the movie at least put its heart into the effort.

I know the answer to that one (its me and faster) but still the man seems to have thrown all caution -- and moisturizer -- to the winds. As little as 10 years ago he was still a sleek-as-a-seal leading man; one of the reasons ""The Big Lebowski"" worked so well was because it was so against type. But since he won the Oscar for playing a stubbly drunk in ""Crazy Heart"" hes not only turned to character parts but shambled through every movie -- ""True Grit"" ""The Giver"" ""R.I.P.D."" -- as if somebody stole his comb and filled his mouth full of crackers. Bridges I love you but when and why did you start channelling Walter Brennan? Hes back doing the grumpy grampa act again in ""Seventh Son"" but as always he seems to be having fun. And for the first time in a while the films kind of fun too. Its all set in some dark ages era in some Byzantine corner of the world -- and Bridges is Master Gregory a ""spook"" (or what wed call a witchhunter). And business is good although -- like Dirty Harry -- Gregory has a habit of losing his partners. Hes just gotten himself a new one as the film starts and just in time -- Julianne Moore the queen of the witches just escaped from the desert dungeon where Gregory not-very-securely locked her up a few decades ago. And shes ticked off. Shes also -- as the villainnesses in these things always are -- looking fabulous with mesmerizing smokey eyes and long fluttering gowns. Really Julianne do think about this look for Oscar night -- although the black talons might be a bit much for the Mani Cam. So anyway its up to Gregory and his new apprentice to catch her again -- although now she has an entire army of shape-shifting creatures on her side and is gaining in power every day. Obviously this is not a particularly serious movie -- theres one scene of happy villagers leading a witch off to execution that feels remarkably like a ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" outtake -- but neither is it sloppy. The action scenes are well-staged. The witches -- who seem to like changing into dragons occasionally -- are formidable creatures. Moore is deliciously evil as the witch queen allowing herself just a few campy lines; Bridges isnt nearly as restrained. But thats all right. A film like this needs some melodrama -- and Ben Barnes is so forgettable as the apprentice (and Alicia Vikander so drippy as a young villager he falls for) that the old stars need to work overtime. But they do and the veteran director Sergei Bodrov (who has made some far more serious films in Russia and shown a feel for harsh landscapes) gets some terrific shots (particularly since he went no further than British Columbia to get them). It all ends in Moores very Turkish-looking castle with Gregory and company facing down the witch and her various African and Asian allies and although theres an ugly flicker of prejudice there -- of course its the West that represents the forces of good -- its all over with a kiddie-matinee climax of swordfights and feuding dragons. The film ends with Jeff Bridges riding off in search of further adventures. I hope he finds them. I may miss the twinkling leading man of the 90s. But whoever this grizzled old character actor is hes having a hell of a time. Seventh Son (PG-13) Universal (102 min.) Directed by Sergei Bodrov. With Ben Barnes Julianne Moore Jeff Bridges.

VPCJeff Bridges goes hunting for witches in a paint-by-numbers action fantasy.Jeff Bridges (right) plays ""spook"" John Gregory and Ben Barnes plays his apprentice in ""Seventh Son.""(Photo Legendary Pictures)Story Highlights2 stars (out of 5)Fantasy flick is based on the novel ""The Spooks Apprentice"" by Joseph Delaney.It has a lot of action and decent special effects but not much else going for it.You cant judge a book by its cover were told. But movie trailers on the other hand often are remarkably accurate predictors. And thus it is that ""Seventh Son"" delivers exactly what it promises Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore slumming in a laughably generic sword-and-sorcery almost-epic.Bridges at least seems to be having a little fun while doing it. Affecting an obscure (but at least consistent) accent he plays John Gregory a grizzled booze-swilling ""spook"" whose job is supernatural pest control. As the seventh son of a seventh son he has been gifted with extraordinary strength and agility which he uses to battle his chief enemy shape-shifting witches. (Yes he burns them.)When his latest apprentice (Kit Harrington of ""Game of Thrones"") puts in for an unexpected early retirement so to speak Gregory finds a replacement seventh son a starry-eyed farm boy named Tom Ward (Ben Barnes who played Prince Caspian in the Narnia movies). Unfortunately the new recruit doesnt look very promising. Whats more theres only a week to train him up. After that the ""blood moon"" will be full and the witch queen Mother Malkin (Moore) will unleash hell on earth.Based on the novel ""The Spooks Apprentice"" by Joseph Delaney ""Seventh Son"" doesnt offer anything like the richly realized world of ""The Lord of the Rings."" Mostly our heroes wander around in empty wilderness filled with craggy peaks and unexpected chasms and then a palace or walled city will pop up out of the blue.Russian director Sergei Bodrov (""Mongol"") does manage to deliver some entertaining fight scenes and special effects involving the witches each of whom transforms into some sort of monster. Some including characters played by Moore and Djimon Hounsou change into dragons but theres also a giant bear and a saber-toothed cat. (One of the witches insultingly looks like a Hindu deity complete with extra arms.)The story is a simple kill-the-monsters quest with an obligatory romance between Tom and a pretty young half-witch (Alicia Vikander) tacked on. Despite a few amusing one-liners by old Gregory the writing is abysmal filled with such ponderous pronouncements as ""You live in a world now where legend and nightmare are real"" and ""Remember all you need is inside you. Just dont be afraid to look.""This advice from Toms mother actually turns out to be a lie because he also needs -- this being a generic sword-and-sorcery almost-epic -- a magical talisman to be all that he can be. But this isnt the kind of story that pays attention to such details. And because only Bridges character comes even close to being interesting there isnt a single moment when you fear (or root) for anyone.In short ""Seventh Son"" is recommended only for the most far-gone of fantasy addicts for whom it will serve as a sort of methadone. It wont exactly satisfy but it will tide you over until the next season of ""Game of Thrones.""Ah now thats the stuff.Seventh Son2 stars (out of 5) Director Sergei Bodrov.Cast Jeff Bridges Ben Barnes Julianne Moore.Rating PG-13 for intense fantasy violence and action throughout frightening images and brief strong language.Reach the reviewer at kerry.lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//azc.cc/1D30NUE More Stories Roberts Pence working to overturn Trumps media ban July 29 2016 1201 p.m. Montini Pence decries name-calling.

A man of foresight and mysterious powers and in the Willie Dixon blues song Seventh Son a lover extraordinaire ""I can take you baby hold you in my arms/ And make the flesh quiver on your lovely bones.""Seventh Son the movie sounds promising. The story is based on the first of a series of popular young adult fantasy novels called The Wardstone Chronicles by English writer Joseph Delaney. Russias Sergei Bodrov directed the Oscar-nominated movie Prisoner of the Mountains. The screenwriters include Charles Leavitt behind the Leonardo DiCaprio thriller Blood Diamond and Steven Knight (Eastern Promises Locke). The front-of-camera talent includes Julianne Moore as a superwitch and her Big Lebowski co-star Jeff Bridges as a witch fighter or ""Spook."" Director Richard Starzak and animator Andy Symanowski discuss making a movie with stop-motion star Shaun the Sheep. (Feb. 4) AP Video Video Video Shaun the Sheep makes the leap to the big screen Video Video Mila Kunis shows off post-baby body at Jupiter Ascending premiere The younger couple aimed at the intended young target audience include the sensitively handsome Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia) as Thomas Gregorys apprentice a young man whose occasional epileptic-type seizures cause him to have visions of the future. His romantic interest is rising Swedish star Alicia Vikander (A Royal Affair Anna Karenina) as a winsome young half-witch Alice.Yet even in 3-D and shot in the mountains of British Columbia the film is a flat experience with an incongruity between its big-budget ambitions and ho-hum impact. After a series of throat-clearing establishing scenes we eventually learn that Master Gregory (Bridges) is a hard-boozing knight (Bridgess accent suggests a British Yoda talking through a mouthful of marshmallows) who has imprisoned the witch Mother Malkin many years ago.Now Malkin has escaped and as a woman Gregory previously scorned for another has apocalyptic revenge in mind. With a ""blood moon"" approaching Malkin (Moore in her natural auburn hair and a Lone Ranger band of eye makeup) has summoned an army of too many creatures including warlocks ninja warriors and one really big bear to make the common folk even more miserable than they already are. Failing to establish either focus or rhythm the movie attempts to use abrupt transitions to create a succession of scares and surprises. The two middle-aged Oscar-calibre stars go eyeball-to-eyeball as they utter threats and curses but the mixture of generic green-screen dangers and voice-altering technology mutes any scary impact.The common folk who form the backdrop in a few scenes look medieval (bodices jerkins swords) though there are enough broken columns and big-headed statues to suggest a sort of mash-up of Roman Empire and Easter Island while Marco Beltramis orchestral score is at full blast throughout attempting to import a seriousness of purpose the script repeatedly betrays.What were left with is a story about women with special powers who must be burned alive to be defeated. Torching ""witches"" is the one part of the story that has some historical basis and adds an uncomfortable edge of misogyny to this otherwise empty fantasy.

(Courtesy photo) Article Tweet Change text size for the story Print this story Report an error Seventh Son 1.5 stars Starring Jeff Bridges Julianne Moore Ben Barnes Kit Harington Alicia Vikander Directed by Sergei Bodrov Written by Charles Leavitt Steven Knight Duration 120 minutes Teeming with warlocks witches and wicked humans Seventh Son is a hilariously bad movie. Set in a fractured fantasy version of the Middle Ages this is an overpriced Hollywood production that has gone wildly off the tracks. As it spins its wheels in mediocrity and stupidity this movies fate is certain box office catastrophe after years of delays caused by studio shenanigans and the wait for a cash infusion from China. Incredibly Seventh Son is headlined by two notable American stars -- wily veteran Jeff Bridges Oscar winner for Crazy Heart and Julianne Moore current frontrunner as best actress for Still Alice -- in the worst performances of their careers. Past and future. Ditto for support players such as Djimon Hounsou Kit Harington Antje Traue and Olivia Williams. Meanwhile I pity the young male lead and his ingenue Ben Barnes (as the Spooks new apprentice) and Alicia Vikander (as his witchy love interest). In what passes as plot in this overcooked cauldron of familiar fantasy ingredients Bridges plays a Spook a medieval witch hunter who wields axes knives swords chains torches bags of silver dust and a magic staff to do his dirty work. Moore decked out in black leather spikes and a scorpion-like tail that is strangely fetching for the 54-year-old hottie plays the queen of the witches. Mobile users click this link Moore is bitter that Bridges her former lover locked her up inside a mountain for decades just because she went to the dark side with her witchcraft. Bridges is annoyed that she finally escaped and is now ""burninating the countryside"" like Trogdor. An epic smackdown is inevitable after plenty of peasants are incinerated in their thatched-roofed cottages. The mayhem is mostly bloodless. Seventh Son is not gory. It is extremely loud and relentless especially because Marco Beltramis score is played at Megadeath levels. Seventh Son is available to see in IMAX 3D. In this case the up-conversion is a gimmick to distract viewers. But it does make the transformations -- especially Moore from humanoid witch to supernatural smoke and dragon -- impressive for a few seconds. On first viewing. Ditto for the queen witchs interior decorating skills. She whips her dreary castle into a luxurious witch lair in a matter of seconds. Seventh Son which was shot on location in British Columbia and directed by Russian-born filmmaker Sergei Bodrov is based on British sci-fi and fantasy writer Joseph Delaneys novel The Spooks Apprentice (a.k.a. The Last Apprentice Revenge of the Witch). Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) and Steven Knight (Dirty Pretty Things Eastern Promises) adapted the book to the screen. I am incredulous that Knight in particular could write something this awful given his past work. The dialogue in Seventh Son is dismal. The plotting is awkward. Nothing much works as storytelling. But even those problems are overshadowed by the accents -- the source of much of the hilarity. Bridges is the chief culprit perhaps because he knew just what kind of movie he was in. Forcing out the words through his Don Quixote facial hair Bridges uses some of his Rooster Cogburn bark from True Grit and sound-mixes it with Bela Lugosis lugubrious Transylvanian thing from the 1931 Dracula. The result is pitch-perfect for Seventh Son -- if you want a good laugh during a very bad movie.

Meanwhile I pity the young male lead and his ingenue Ben Barnes (as the Spooks new apprentice) and Alicia Vikander (as his witchy love interest).

"Seventh Son a first-class dud review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMovies Seventh Son a first-class dud review CGI-heavy fantasy Seventh Son relies on stars Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore to try to engage an audience but fails.By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Feb. 5 2015Seventh SonStarring Julianne Moore Jeff Bridges and Ben Barnes. Directed by Sergei Bodrov. 102 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. PGA messy melding of various fantasy themes that relies on CGI dazzle star power and stunning Canadian scenery to detract from a half-baked story Seventh Son emerges as a strong contender for worst movie of 2015.It wouldnt be worth more than a passing glance arriving after a years delay in getting to theatres except for the gold-plated cast including Oscar winner Jeff Bridges and nominees Julianne Moore and Djimon Hounsou.Article Continued BelowBridges who has let his career go to seed with great efficiency since Crazy Heart (2009) and True Grit (2010) plays mercenary knight Master Gregory with a wildly fluctuating accent that swings between faux British wheeze and crazy mush-mouthed Appalachian mountain man.Gregory loves hunting witches only slightly more than the bottle. Even when hammered hes the most nimble fighter in this sort-of medieval-looking land.Prone to tossing out occasional wisecracks and appearing to be bothered by ill-fitting dentures Gregory has a personal reason for wanting to deal with witch queen Mother Malkin (Moore) who stalks her mountaintop palace lair spitting threatening lines about making people pay.Shes ramping up her powers and getting her minions together for a final battle with the good guys -- and looking darn fine doing it decked out in back corsets and feathers. Moore plays her with campy glee even when morphing into a flying (red-headed) dragon with a lethal metal tail.Malkin also eats maggoty blood cakes ""for energy"" and pauses amid her evilness to compliment a fellow witch on her shoes.Gregorys previous apprentices havent survived to carry on the witch-dispatching work as Game of Thrones Kit Harington proves. Gregory takes on Tom Ward (Narnias Ben Barnes) whom he believes has inherited mystical powers strength and bravery by being the seventh son of a seventh son just like in the Johnny Rivers song.Tom has to earn the right to commandeer the masters magical flame-thrower but hes distracted by pretty fortune teller Alice (A Royal Affairs Alicia Vikander) who is working both sides of the witch game.Taken from Joseph Delaneys Wardstone Chronicles fantasy series of Spooks titles Seventh Sons filmmakers throw every digital trick in the book onscreen. Wispy ghosts shape-shifters waterfall escapes its all in there including a four-armed sword-wielding demon that will stir memories of Ray Harryhausen. Hounsou gets some screen-time as a baddie with swinging axe-blade hands.But the whiz-bang cant distract from horrible dialogue and a confusing patchwork story. Even among the characters who seem to have clear goals at the outset its not always easy to figure out just what the heck is going on. Or in Bridges case occasionally understand what hes mumbling.Director Sergei Bodrov (Prisoner of the Mountains Mongol) cant seem to get enough big effects-filled fight scenes but has much less success with conversations and connections making sitting through Seventh Son a battle on its own.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Seventh Sons medieval fantasy falls flat on every level - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Seventh Sons medieval fantasy falls flat on every level Betsy Sharkey .BetsySharkey says Seventh Son may be the worst movie of the year (and she knows its only February) I know its early but ""Seventh Son"" may actually be the worst movie of the year. It will most certainly be a contender. The medieval/fantasy/action/drama/romance hits pretty close to a perfect 10 on the egregious scale.Lets start with the beginning and work our way down from there. Scene a windy mountain top. A heavy metal disk -- latticed not solid -- pounded shut by a lone man. An antsy horse nearby. A womans desperate ""have mercy"" rises. Man and horse speed away. Cue effects Time-lapse of sky above mountain below -- many weather patterns zoom by for a very long time. Must be years.It is -- in the sense that it feels as if the effect will never end. Next we see a medieval tavern where formal character introductions begin. Its a great cast. Seriously. Actors who are loved respected some even Oscar-nominated and/or awarded. Its perhaps best to assume the ""yes"" from Julianne Moore Jeff Bridges and Djimon Hounsou to ""Seventh Son"" was made on little sleep or under the influence. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link They play respectively a dragon-witch named Mother Malkin a spook-grand master of the supernatural called Master Gregory and a shape-shifting evil something or other who goes by Radu.For rising stars such as Ben Barnes (dashing Prince Caspian in the ""Narnia"" films) Kit Harington (dishy Jon Snow of the Nights Watch in ""Game of Thrones"") and the Swedish actress Alicia Vikander (the lovely opposite Mads Mikkelsen in ""A Royal Affair"") its early enough in their careers that all will be either forgotten or forgiven.Barnes plays the films anointed one Tom Ward Master Gregorys new apprentice the seventh son of a seventh son. Harington as Billy Bradley was Master Gregorys apprentice sob all too briefly. Vikander is Alice the very fetching half-witch who soon steals Toms heart. Seventh Son Ben Stiller no match for Granny at Chinese box office Julie Makinen Taiwanese director Cheng Zhengdaos comedy ""Miss Granny"" outpaced the Hollywood competition at the mainland China box office last week knocking Ben Stillers ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" from the No. 1 spot and outperforming the Jeff Bridges-Ben Barnes fantasy epic ""Seventh Son""... Taiwanese director Cheng Zhengdaos comedy ""Miss Granny"" outpaced the Hollywood competition at the mainland China box office last week knocking Ben Stillers ""Night at the Museum Secret of the Tomb"" from the No. 1 spot and outperforming the Jeff Bridges-Ben Barnes fantasy epic ""Seventh Son""... (Julie Makinen) Lets pause for a word for (yes for) our sponsors. To those who signed off on the reportedly 90-plus-million budget. Next time just say ""no."" To those who kept delaying ""Seventh Sons"" release -- you were right.For acclaimed Russian director Sergei Bodrov this foray into English-language filmmaking is a rare fail. Bodrov certainly knows his way around epics as his excellent Oscar-nominated films ""Mongol"" and ""Prisoner of the Mountains"" attest. ""Seventh"" comes as a shock. Virtually every performance falls flat aided no doubt by the vapid dialogue. And Bridges is saddled with an awful accent he never masters.The movie is based on John Delaneys popular young adult novels published in the U.S. as ""The Last Apprentice."" There are 13 and the bits and pieces pulled to patch together this sketchy script by Charles Leavitt (""Blood Diamond"") and Steven Knight (with an Oscar nod for ""Dirty Pretty Things"") do not do the series justice.Any hopes that the film like the books would produce a string of successes were probably dashed when Moore in her dragon incarnation breaks free. It comes early and is unfortunately not the thrilling terrifying moment its meant to be.With time on her hands Mother intends to A) rule the world B) punish Master Gregory for her imprisonment and C) fix up her mountain kingdom. C) she can manage with the wave of her hand. A) and B) will take the rest of the movie to resolve.Back to the tavern. Master Gregory is drunk. The bells are ringing to signal danger. Bradley comes rushing in. As do some soldiers who apparently know nothing of Master Gregorys prowess. A fight ensues with Bridges doing a lot of fast-moving sword fighting and extensively choreographed pummeling though to think of it there might have been a stunt double mentioned somewhere.Toms soon recruited to help Master master Mother. Their journey is treacherous. Tom will be tested. Possibly tattooed. Meanwhile Mothers fire-breathing mad -- but then apparently she always is and she didnt even have to pay the price of admission.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com------------Seventh SonMPAA rating PG-13 for intense fantasy violence and action throughout frightening images and brief strong languageRunning time 2 hoursPlaying In general release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Movies Reviews Entertainment SpongeBob to soak up box office push American Sniper out of top spot Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-seventh-son-review-20150206-column.html#navtype=outfit,200,seventhson12,seventhson,latimes

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Seventh Son is brisk and unpretentious though the fact that these two qualities can be considered remarkable probably says more about the state of modern genre filmmaking than it does about the movie itself. Directed by the reliably competent Sergei Bodrov (Prisoner Of The Mountains Mongol The Rise Of Genghis Khan) and set in a prefab medieval world of millwheels and CGI fire the long-shelved fantasy flick stars Jeff Bridges as Master Gregory a gruff witch-hunter trying to take down a stylish witch queen (Julianne Moore) and her band of shape-shifting sorcerers with the help of his bland apprentice Tom (Ben Barnes).As Gregory Bridges inflates his cheeks pushes out his lower jaw into a severe Habsburg underbite and keeps his lips pursed at all times as though his handlebar mustache and chin puff beard were drawstrings pulled tight. He cuts an imposing off-putting medieval figure alternately barking and mushing his dialogue. In short hes the single oddest most interesting thing about Seventh Son which features one of those generic fate-of-the-world battles of good vs. evil that seem to happen whenever wizards and amulets are involved. Theres something about a once-a-century red moon and a fallen order of knights--all seventh sons of seventh sons as are Master Gregory and Tom--but frankly the movie could be about anything.Big-budget effects-driven fantasies have the resources to get as strange and surprising as they like yet so few of them ever do. Seventh Son traffics in baseline generic gratification quests journeys training montages and lots of talk about fate and destiny. The evildoers our heroes find themselves vanquishing all change size and shape--one (Jason Scott Lee) turns into a giant bear another (Djimon Hounsou) into a lizard-like dragon--but even the potential thrill of a battle of continually changing scale is sucked out by Bodrovs stolid staging. Bodrov knows the ins and outs of framing a fight between differently sized figures--placing his heroes alongside columns doorways and tunnels for scale--but has no real knack for the kind of non-realistic size-changing effects that can make CGI so fun to watch. (One can only imagine what a field day a genuinely loopy stylist--say someone like Tsui Hark--would have had with material.)There are little flashes of life all courtesy of Bridges Master Gregory many involving his tendency to rattle off information about the assorted supernatural dangers that inhabit his universe. (Ghasts are fragments of ghosts for instance and will go away if ignored.) If theres a reason why these little tidbits feel so tantalizing its because theyre the only moments in the film that actively engage the viewers imagination asking them to accept or visualize the workings of an unseen world.

The witch Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore) is a wanted woman in the fantasy movie ""Seventh Son."" Photo Associated Press Jeff Bridges flawed hero shtick wears thin in ""Seventh Son"" 1 / 6 Back to Gallery Im really starting to worry about Jeff Bridges. Ever since Bridges won an Oscar in 2010 for his performance as a drunken musician who mumbles a lot in ""Crazy Heart"" he has played a drunken U.S. marshal who mumbles a lot in ""True Grit"" a U.S. marshal who mumbles a lot in ""R.I.P.D"" and now a drunken knight who mumbles a lot in ""Seventh Son."" Starting to sense a theme here? ""Seventh Son"" directed by Sergei Bodrov is a competently made yet flat fantasy adventure. But such mediocrity is hardly worthy of Bridges whose prodigious talent was most evident in ""The Fabulous Baker Boys"" and ""Seabiscuit."" Yet for some reason Bridges has been content to parody himself with characters like Gregory a knight who enlists the help of a young man Tom (Ben Barnes) to defeat the evil witch Mother Malkin (the age-defying Julianne Moore). ""Seventh Son"" is based on the novel ""The Spooks Apprentice"" by Joseph Delaney. I never read the book but something tells me that the source material is superior to the film. For example amid the usual swords spells and monsters you expect from a movie of this genre there is some interesting parallelism between Gregory and Tom. As it turns out Gregory and Malkin were once in love before the witch got really jealous and murdered Gregorys wife. Tom himself has fallen in love with a witch Alice (Alicia Vikander) a spy for Malkin. There are some interesting themes to be explored here good versus evil head versus heart duty versus desire. Unfortunately ""Seventh Son"" tries to commit to everything and does nothing particularly well. Even the action scenes are labored and boring. The result is a movie that serves as little more than an excuse for Moore and Bridges to camp it up. At least Moore has not played a character like Malkin in recent memory. The same cannot be said for Bridges whose flawed alcoholic hero shtick is starting to wear thin. Thomas Lee is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.

Jeff Bridgess abysmally campy performance may be the worst thing about disposable sword-and-sorcery fantasy Seventh Son but its also the only memorable thing. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - Bridges struggles to enliven a rote heros-quest plot -- skeptical apprentice Tom (Ben Barnes) trains with hard-hearted magician Gregory (Bridges) to fulfill a prophecy and stop evil witch Malkin (Julianne Moore) -- by mumbling declaratively through pursed lips until he sounds like he has a ruinous case of denture-lisp.When Bridges isnt too prominent Seventh Son feels like an easily distracted dungeonmasters Damp;D campaign. Tom and Gregory spend most of the film banishing Malkins expensive-looking but forgettable CGI monster allies including a shapeshifting man-bear and a giant blind troll called a ""boggart"" and then exchanging tough-guy quips that would only sound cool if they were improvised while rolling a twelve-sided die.Film Details Seventh Son RatingPG-13 GenreSciFi/Fantasy Running Time120 More Info Trailer Gregory snaps ""You fight me as a dragon not as a man. Have you no honor?"" That line is lousy but Bridgess heinous performance -- he speaks as if he has a mouthful of chewing tobacco he refuses to spit out -- proves that trying too hard can be so much worse than not trying hard enough.

VPCJulianne Moore co-stars in Seventh Son.(Photo  AP)With the big show looming this month its not an ideal time for thudding turns by a couple of current Oscar nominees.In the intergalactic mess that is Jupiter Ascending best-actor hopeful Eddie Redmayne (The Theory of Everything) delivers a ridiculously over-the-top performance. And in Seventh Son Julianne Moore (Still Alice) the favorite for this years best-actress Oscar takes on a silly part in a dismal medieval fantasy ( 1/2 out of four; rated PG-13; opens Friday nationwide).Its not surprising that both epic-fail fantasies are opening this week since this time of year is often a dumping ground for the worst fare. Whats surprising is that either movie was ever made.Moore goes into operatic mode as Mother Malkin a nasty witch who morphs into a menacing winged dragon. The worst performance however belongs to Jeff Bridges as a marble-mouthed curmudgeonly knight named Master Gregory. The artist formerly known as the Dude is mystifyingly referred to here as a ""spook"" which should not be confused with a ghost or a ""ghast. Ghosts are just what we think they are and ghasts are parts of ghosts that have already moved on. Confused yet?Master Gregory is the last of an elite corps of spooks whose job is to rid the world of evil. Hes constantly imbibing a ""fermented drink"" but he never seems impaired. Hes no spring chicken but he can still slay dragons raging beasts that resemble grizzlies and legions of rampaging soldiers. Oh and he can administer a badass tattoo. There isnt much Master Gregory cant do -- except answer simple questions make himself intelligible or keep his apprentices alive and kicking.How he has managed to draw assistants over the years given his awful track record is perhaps a more intriguing story than the plot of this plodding movie based on a fantasy book series by Joseph Delaney. His previous aides have all perished under his tutelage including Mr. Bradley (Game of Thrones Kit Harington).But when the crusty knight meets farm boy Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) the seventh son of a seventh son were supposed to root for all that to change.That double-seven business comes with superhuman strength and premonitory visions but when we first see Tom having a revelation it seems to incapacitate him as if hes having a seizure.Master Gregory is a lackadaisical mentor. Still their relationship -- bland as it is -- seems positively compelling compared to the lackluster chemistry-free romance Tom strikes up with a young ghoul named Alice (Alicia Vikander). They are the storys star-crossed lovers Hes a reluctant spook whose mission is to rid the world of witches -- and shes a witch whose mother is a handmaiden to malicious Mother Malkin.If Mother Malkin is so relentlessly malevolent why does her name sound as though she spends her time knitting in a rocking chair?The 3-D effects are off-putting Smoke spills out at the audience and the camera swooshes high and careens over cliffs. Its more dizzying than dazzling.Further mucking up the attempts at magical fantasy is a distracting bombastic musical score and feeble attempts at humor.Seventh Son is thoroughly ill-conceived a pale imitation of its more adventurous and breathtaking brethren. 4 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/1D2V29C",http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2015/02/05/seventh-son-review/22920679/,200,seventhson17,seventhson,usatoday

She then transforms into a dragon and flies at the camera roaring and bellowing. In 3D. Like the other pushed-back pumped-up would-be blockbuster opening this week ""Jupiter Ascending"" ""Seventh Son"" feels like the cinematic equivalent of cheese-stuffed pizza crust or a sandwich in which fried chicken serves as the bun concerned that our palates have become numbed by excess in the past these films offer us an excess of excess as the antidote alternating between exposition and explosion as required and interrupted by CGI-heavy action scenes every 10 minutes to jolt our bored nerves into something like attention. Its not a tactic that works especially well in either case. See Video Jeff Bridges May Put You to Sleep With His Squarespace Super Bowl Ad (Video) Directed by Sergei Bodrov (""Mongol the Rise of Genghis Khan"") ""Seventh Son"" is a chosen-one-is-mentored-to-fight-evil story so off-the-rack that it still has the tags on it. Based on Joseph Delaneys novel ""The Spooks Apprentice"" with screenplay credit to Stephen Knight (""Locke"") and Charles Leavitt (""In the Heart of the Sea"") its set in a fantasy kingdom where Jeff Bridges plays Master Gregory an aging knight of the order known as the Falcons (informally known as ""Spooks"") dedicated to wiping out the evil supernatural beings that plague the land as a combination of exorcist game warden and cop. Bridges plays the part with such a mumbled grumbled vocal tone it makes it nigh-impossible to hear half his dialogue and the half you can hear is transformed into unintentional comedy as it dribbles out of his lips like cold gravy. Gregory finds his latest apprentice in Tom Ward (Ben Barnes ""Sons of Liberty"") a seventh son of a seventh son. Gregory needs an apprentice because his old nemesis Mother Malkin (Moore providing a level of ham so cultured its really more like jamon iberico) has escaped the prison he put her in and -- as noted in the pre-credit sequence -- the coming of the blood moon is making her a threat yet again. Also Read OscarWrap Julianne Moore Still a Contender Still Brilliant in Still Alice Look at the production team for ""Seventh Son"" and you stand slack-jawed in awe the cinematographer is Newton Thomas Sigel of ""Drive"" and ""The Usual Suspects."" The music is by Marco Beltrami of ""Snowpiercer"" and ""The Hurt Locker."" The production design is by Dante Ferretti of ""The Aviator"" and ""Shutter Island."" John Dykstra of ""Star Wars"" ""Silent Running"" ""Godzilla"" and ""Caddyshack"" is credited as the visual effects designer. But the film those luminaries have made is all slack and no awe; many of the scenes feel like theyre being shot through a foot-thick protective layer of Vaseline with outside shots bathed in a murky dirty-dishwater light that isnt helped by the films 3D. The music is just noise. And the sets look as if the Max Fischer Players decided to pay tribute to ""Game of Thrones"" while the effects are competently adequate in service of a bland and busy script. The plots familiar menu of betrayals and bonding combat and confessions mystical whatsits and long-standing prophecies is also a problem up to and including Toms romance with part-time witch Alice (Alicia Vikander) which leaves Tom torn between Gregorys imperatives of duty and her big brown eyes. When Tom notes that he couldnt bring himself to kill a sorcerer by burning him alive Alice explains ""To be no good ... at something bad ... is good"" a howler of a line that sits alongside dull discussions of destiny boring interpretations of visions and three films worth of villainous shapeshifters spellcasters and swordsmen being hurled at us in the hopes well care about any of them. Also Read Why Thomas Tulls China Deal Strengthens His Hand With Warner Bros. (Video) ""Seventh Son"" aspires to the same majesty -- and box office -- as the ""Lord of the Rings"" films but its so clumsily made and creakily written its hard to imagine that happening. I know that its an easy joke to suggest that a film should have gone straight to video but ""Seventh Son"" feels like it was made to go straight to ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" where its unintentional comedy could be properly celebrated in the appropriate context. ""Seventh Son"" tells a story of dragons witches ghosts and ogres but the most fantastic thing about it is the idea that someone thought this lumpy bumpy and swollen sack of tired tropes and cluttered CGI would attract audiences.

The Giver and now this schlocky bit of medieval Young Adult adventure. At this point its tempting to wonder if Jeff Bridges accepts roles chiefly on the basis of whether or not hell get to sport grizzly facial hair and talk funny. Here he plays a spook a merciless mercenary who specializes in the supernatural particularly witches. When his old nemesis (Julianne Moore not even trying) escapes and kills his apprentice hes got to find a new one the generically handsome accent-free seventh son of a seventh son (Ben Barnes). But wait Witch-lady Moore has an apprentice of her own a generically beautiful accent-free half witch (Alicia Vikander). Will they meet? And if they do...? Whatever sparks of interest the story can offer are quickly extinguished by the silly CGI action washed-out image and laughable dialogue (""All you ever need is inside you; just dont be afraid to look."").

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint SEVENTH SON [?][?][?] out of four stars Rated PG-13 for intense fantasy violence and action throughout. ""Seventh Son"" is a bona fide hoot not because of its swords-and-sorcery subject matter -- thats pretty common -- but its tone. Based on Joseph Delaneys popular young adult ""Spook"" series its a nifty saga of dragons and witches and ghosts and spells packing plenty of sly humor in among its lethal skirmishes. Top among the good things herein is the ever-delightful Jeff Bridges reprising his iconic Rooster Cogburn from ""True Grit"" with even more grit. He plays Gregory a cantankerous old exorcist who battles evil with snap kicks as much as holy script. Hes the sort of hard-drinking mystical warrior who when food supplies are needed for a long quest goes to the tavern. He allows his young protege Tom (Ben Barnes) a farmhand heir to supernatural powers as a Seventh Son to take only one reviving sip from his flask after battle since ""It belongs to me."" Bridges raspy growl creates a vocal performance thats ticklishly funny regardless of thedialogue. The pair set off to challenge wicked queen Malkin who doubles as a flying fire-breathing serpent (Julianne Moore giving Meryl Streeps ""Into the Woods"" witch a run for her money). Determined to destroy their Kingdom she commands a team of shape-shifting evildoers including Djimon Hounsou straight from his slick bad guy riffing in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon 2."" Malkin and Gregory have an added complication to their combat as they were once true loves. Tom and a fetching damsel from Malkins team develop a sort of similar fling giving the story an additional pitch of Romeo and Juliet nonsense. Nothing here is particularly fresh but watching it is like seeing a slice of familiar art reworked with a colorful new swatch of Crayolas. Deep? No. Thoughtful? No. A thigh-slapping good time? Oh yes. Colin Covert Universal Pictures Ben Barnes and Jeff Bridges in ""Seventh Son."" LOVE ROSIE [?][?] out of four stars Rated R for language and some sexual content Theater Eden Prairie Lily Collins plays the title character from Cecelia Aherns novel a narrator we meet on a wedding day where she advises herself ""Tell them that this is that this has to be one of the happiest days of my life."" Shes convincing herself because she isnt convincing us. Alex (Sam Claflin) was the first boy she held hands with practically her intended since they were in elementary school. ""Love Rosie"" tracks them over a star-crossed dozen years of bad timing failed outside relationships hard feelings and wedding toasts. Collins (""Mirror Mirror"") and Claflin of the last ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie do well by the mooning-over-each-other-across-a-crowded-dance-floor stuff. But they have to keep us believing in ""the dream"" and hoping for their romance. They dont. The watery chemistry the on-the-nose choice of pop tunes to illustrate moments (an infamous Lily Allen hit and ""Alone Again Naturally"" turn up naturally) keep ""Love Rosie"" in the ""Maybe wed be better off as friends"" zone.

Photo Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures MOVIE REVIEW Seventh Son Running time 103 minutes. Rated PG-13 (action violence). ""Seventh Son"" harks back to ancient times the early 1960s when kiddie matinees featured pirate skeletons sword-fighting sea serpents and all was right with the world. Its a medieval fantasy in which the local knight and demon hunter known as the Spook (Jeff Bridges doing a crazy-coot mumble) enlists the aid of a sturdy seventh son (Ben Barnes) to aid him to battle local sorceress Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore in let-er-rip mode). Some scripts seem like they were written with a bottle of whiskey and a loaded .45 close at hand. ""Seventh Son"" seems to have been dreamed up in close proximity to juice boxes and fluffernutters. Nothing needs to make sense; it just needs to sound wicked to your average 10-year-old. Hence ""Lets have the lady dress up in a black thing with feathers like a witch or a demon"" ""Yeah Or Cher"" ""She turns into a dragon"" ""Skeleton dragon"" "". . . made of metal"" ""Of course And she eats bloodcakes"" "". . . with live worms"" The boyish senselessness is the point The movie doesnt get bogged down in explaining how it all works or what exactly it will take to bring the witch down. All you need to know is that if it looks cool to have someone explode into a fireball when poked with a wooden spear thats what well get. If things threaten to get a little dull when our young hero falls for the witchy niece (Alicia Vikander) therell be a tree-monster or a man-bear along shortly. Toward the end someone randomly turns into a jaguar and who can argue with that? Julianne Moore in ""Seventh Son.""Photo Legendary Pictures and Universal Pictures In addition to featuring Oscar-brand actors (Djimon Hounsou is also on hand as an assassin-dragon) the visuals are more than serviceable. Oscar winners toiled behind the scenes too -- there are Dante Ferretti sets and John Dykstra special effects each of them slumming it in style. Perhaps no achievement is more impressive than that of Bridges who manages to keep a straight face throughout even in the inevitable training montage. After giving his young protege a sip from an enchanted-looking flask he warns gravely ""You must never take more than one sip of this a day."" Why? ""Because its mine"" he snaps. ""Seventh Son"" is not a good movie but its also not a pretentious one and I call that a fair trade. I was disappointed that there were no fire-breathing mummy ninjas from space but you have to save something for the sequel.

Please remember that I am battle-hardened from many years of snark and superiority and semi-comfortable theater seating; please dont try this at home. Other than a moderate brain-worm headache a sense of time-space dissociation that may not be permanent and an urgent need to drink four glasses of wine rapidly (it may have been five) I suffered no ill effects. I am ready to answer the important questions Between ""Seventh Son"" and ""Jupiter Ascending"" the twin unloved CGI monstrosities of February which one more closely resembles a Wachowski siblings film and which is more like a mid-90s World Wrestling Federation pay-per-view event?Appealing as it is to do a compare-and-contrast on these two movies which are forever welded into one magnificent whole in my mind they both hypothetically deserve individual attention and anyway I dont want to violate the Seventh Commandment of the Internet Thou shalt spread the fanboy clickbait across the field like unto flaxseed and coriander. So we begin with ""Seventh Son"" which is not a Wachowski film but quite likely could have been or should have been. Its directed far more strangely by Sergei Bodrov a veteran of the Soviet and Russian film industry who has twice made Oscar-nominated foreign-language epics (""Prisoner of the Mountains"" in 1996 and ""Mongol"" in 2007.)Bodrov undeniably brings a sense of space scale and historical depth to this warmed-over fantasy and his key collaborators are top-flight Hollywood technicians including cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and production designer Dante Ferretti. There are a few early scenes where ""Seventh Son"" feels like Tarkovskys ""Andrei Rublev"" remade with giant lizards and loud noises. In fact its loosely based on a YA novel by Joseph Delaney called ""The Spooks Apprentice"" (very loosely according to Delaneys fans) and its a thoroughly incoherent generally inane and surprisingly entertaining tale of witches and monsters and what legendary film critic Joe Bob Briggs calls ""beast fu"" all set in a sub-Tolkien sub-""Game of Thrones"" pseudo-medieval universe.That description may make ""Seventh Son"" sound totally pointless. Which essentially it is But there are reasons why you might consider seeing it anyway. Those primarily comprise Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore the former as a bearded boozy witchfinder or exorcist named Master Gregory who splits the difference between Jeff ""The Dude"" Lebowski and Rooster Cogburn of ""True Grit"" and the latter as Gregorys sexy evil reptilian nemesis an ancient witch called Mother Malkin. When in human form Mother Malkin resembles an aging East Village Goth-princess type who eyes Gregorys hunky new apprentice Tom Ward (Ben Barnes) with Ur-cougar hunger. ""A boy"" she purrs slithering across the digital ruined-castle backdrop like a cobra turned fashion model. ""I like boys."" You Might Also Like The only truly interesting direction ""Seventh Son"" could have gone from there is for Tom to abandon his irritating virginal girlfriend Alice (Alicia Vikander) who is Mother Malkins granddaughter or something and swear to be Moores scale-polishing slave for all eternity if shell just say stuff like that once in a while. I seriously think Moore gives a better performance in this stupid movie than she does in ""Still Alice"" which is going to win her an Oscar for playing a smart woman who has Alzheimers. The stakes are lower I guess and theres no reason to aspire to naturalism but shes having a much better time. Mother Malkin is nothing more than an exceptionally literal-minded illustration of the maxim that hell hath no fury etc. but Moore owns every second of it making us feel the characters destructive anger and self-hatred and also the fact that she still loves the man who turned out to be not that into her several millennia earlier. (He locked her in an underground cistern sealed with silver and dirt from the Holy Land or something. And not in a fun frolicky ""50 Shades"" way either.)As for Bridges I cant quite decide whether hes pulling everybodys leg - like he has no idea what this movies about or what Master Gregory is supposed to be doing - or delivering a classic work of Jeff Bridges laconic weirdness. Which leads to the intractable philosophical question of whether there is any difference. Again hes having much more fun in this ludicrous spectacle than he did in the desiccated spinach of ""The Giver"" so Ill take it. There are scenes when Master Gregory mumbles his lines in a somewhat-Russian or ""Old World"" accent and others when Bridges appears to be auditioning for the role of King Lear in Central Park next summer. Im going with the theory that since ""Seventh Son"" has no core identity and no reason for existing Bridges took that on his shoulders What inexplicable new personality will Master Gregory reveal in the next scene? So why does this movie exist? And what the hell are A-list actors like Moore and Bridges doing in something that seems so clearly destined to perplex insomniac Starz viewers several weeks from now? I have two words for you or at least two proper nouns China and Jennifer Lawrence. The ""Hunger Games"" star was originally going to play the boring role of Alice and good for her for figuring out it was a dud. Lawrence didnt take the part and neither did a lot of other actresses (according to gossipy reports) and somewhere along the way Chinas state-owned film company poured a bunch of money into this project either because no one told them that Lawrence was no longer on board or because they didnt understand that swapping her out for Alicia Vikander (who is Swedish and pretty and Im sure a perfectly nice young lady) was the ""Andrei Rublev"" tolling bell of doom. So Bridges and Moore got paid and tried to make something out of nothing because theyre professional actors. There are dumber reasons why movies get made though not a lot dumber.

Director Sergei Bodrov (142). PG-13 Violence. Area theaters. In 3-D and Imax where available. Saints be praised for whatever strange magic brought Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore together for their own little mini-""Big Lebowski"" reunion whether it was playfulness paychecks or an open spot on their calendars. Because they save this mediocre medieval fantasy adventure from the ash heap. Somewhere Nicolas Cage is fuming since his piddly medieval knight film ""Outcast"" also opens Friday. As for ""Son"" the stars shine but the special effects are strictly fantasy-film assembly line with hardly a spark of inspiration. In a plague-free Middle Ages Master John Gregory (Bridges) is a ""spook"" a knight who does exorcisms rids the countryside of ""ghasts"" (ghosts) and battles shape-shifting witches. Gregory is the last of his ancient order once 1000 strong. He takes on an apprentice Tom (Ben Barnes) the obligatory seventh son of a seventh son. Together they hunt down Mother Malkin (Moore) a witch recently freed from the trap Gregory put her in decades before. Tom has secrets that make him a liability and an asset. Gregory has mysteries of his own which will be unearthed as the two fight giant monsters six-armed swordsmen and witches who turn into dragons. Then Tom falls for a pretty ""half-witch"" Alice (Alicia Vikander) -- her father was mortal -- a hurdle since she is set to follow Malkin when the rare ""blood moon"" turns full. Director Sergei Bodrovs movie is based on a kids book in which Tom was a 12-year-old and the actors wisely pitch their performances to a young crowd. Barnes (""The Chronicles of Narnia Prince Caspian"") looks dewy and eager despite a back story that might allow for a glint of mischief. Wearing long black talons and a feathery dress Cher might have sported in 1985 Moore takes campy delight in lip-curling lines like ""Help yourself to the blood cakes little one"" Shes fun in the same way Charlize Theron was in ""Snow White and the Huntsman"" and Moore pops up just infrequently enough to avoiding wearing out her welcome. Bridges is always welcome despite how his growly old-coot voice seems to be coming from inside his pointy Don Quixote-style beard. Since winning a well-deserved Oscar for ""Crazy Heart"" Bridges has grumbled his way through ""True Grit"" ""R.I.P.D."" and ""The Giver."" ""Grit"" was great but the others run the risk of making this beloved actor just a caricature of gentle-souled humanity. Not to mention that the once-and-forever Dude is only 65.

TWITTER Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore topline Legendaryas latest heroic fantasy epic out in France a few months ahead of its long-delayed U.S. release ""I paid good money for you"" claims Jeff Bridges boozing seemingly British witch hunter to his latest apprentice in Seventh Son an effects-laden heroic fantasy tale produced by Legendary Pictures and directed by Russian cineaste Sergei Bodrov (Prisoner of the Mountains). The same can be said for this long delayed and rather benign mash-up of The Lord of the Rings and Jack the Giant Slayer (with a bit of Game of Thrones tossed in) which takes an A-list crew and cast -- including Julianne Moore sporting a black feather dress and matching eyeliner -- and goes nowhere new with it investing lots in VFX and locations but not enough in an original story anyone cares about. Distributed in France in late December where its likely to be wiped from the screen by The Hobbit the Universal release should see moderate numbers when it hits U.S. theatres next February. Box office in Asia and Eastern territories could help pay off some of the bounty. Based on the first book in Joseph Delaneys The Wardstone Chronicles series -- released as The Spooks Apprentice in the U.K. and as the more politically correct The Last Apprentice Revenge of the Witch in the States -- the film also features an impressive writing team with Matt Greenberg (1408) handling story and Charles Leavitt (Blood Diamond) and Steven Knight (Locke) sharing screenplay duties. Read more Legendary Universal Sign 15-Picture Release Deal With Imax But even these pros can go only so far with this deja-vu dragon where two knights battle witches ogres and other shape-shifting creatures for control of a forested kingdom that looks a lot like British Columbia (confirmed in the end credits). The good guys are led by war-torn wino Master Gregory -- played by Bridges with a gobbled-up foreign accent as if Sean Connery had stuffed his face with mashed potatoes and tried to say things like ""You live in a world where legend and nightmare are real."" Gregory is assisted in his duties by a ""seventh son of a seventh son"" accomplice -- a young man born with prophetic visions of doom. The first trainee is portrayed by Kit Harington who looks like he wandered off the HBO set in his Jon Snow garb and somehow landed here. When hes quickly disposed of Gregory finds his next sidekick in Tom Ward (Ben Barnes of The Chronicles of Narnia) a naive farmhand with much to learn about the dark forces especially when he falls for a gorgeous enchantress (Swedish beauty Alicia Vikander A Royal Affair) doubling as a spy for the bad girls. Its not hard to see where this is leading with master and apprentice joining hands after the usual mishaps eventually making their way to the mountaintop lair of evil queen Mother Malkin (Moore) who has decided to unleash havoc for no other clear reason than that Bridges character dumped her for his wife a while back. Talk about motivation. Otherwise the film bears some kind of subtext about powerful women being scorned in a world of men but that idea is never fully exploited by the filmmakers who ask special effects maestro John Dykstra (the original Star Wars) to carry much of the narrative weight as he dishes out dragons warlocks and digital creatures galore. Read more Still Alice Trailer Julianne Moore Grapples With Alzheimers Diagnosis Bodrov is best known for his Oscar-nominated drama Prisoner of the Mountains which he followed with international action flicks including Mongol The Rise of Genghis Kahn. His style here is serviceable though hardly distinguishing and nothing in the Seventh Son really pops off the screen with three credited editors cramming everything into a neat 100 minutes. Its as if the film had entered Legendarys assembly line with some promise but then started clogging up the machine its release delayed for nearly two years due to postproduction woes and issues with then-partner Warner Bros. Whats left is certainly watchable but far from memorable and though a closing scene leaves things open for a sequel business realities may decide otherwise. If anything the movie offers up the guilty pleasure of seeing Bridges and Moore duel it out in front of countless green screens and a few stunning Canadian backdrops -- two great actors clawing at each other with magic staffs and fake fire trying to survive in the netherworld of heroic kitsch.

Legend has is that the seventh son of a seventh son is born with certain special powers which in Joseph Delaneys ""Wardstone Chronicles"" fantasy-lit series include the ability to see supernatural beings and potentially to kill witches. But given the unusually long gestation period for Universals film adaptation ""Seventh Son"" -- which opens in the U.S. on Feb. 6 nearly a year later than originally planned -- one shouldnt be all that surprised to discover some pretty significant birth defects among them a tired plot some very unspecial effects and a pair of grotesquely uneven performances from Jeff Bridges and Julianne Moore. Considering that Universal was still licking its wounds from the pricey Keanu Reeves debacle ""47 Ronin"" (like this project an extravagant vfx-driven tentpole from a Russian director ill suited for Hollywood) when ""Seventh Son"" was supposed to open last February it makes sense that the distributor opted to delay the film (which opened today in France) and fix what it could giving Imax 3D treatment to what already feels rickety on a standard-sized screen. It also makes sense to have put as much distance as possible between this film directed by two-time Oscar nominee Sergei Bodrov (""Prisoner of the Mountains"" ""Mongol"") and ""Season of the Witch"" -- a comparably campy tale of medieval sorcery in which Nicolas Cage threw down the scenery-chewing gauntlet. What emerges is distressingly typical from Universal of late another example of how the studio once responsible for the towns finest monster movies (""Dracula"" ""The Wolf Man"") now churns out ugly cumbersome monstrosities (""Dracula Untold"" ""The Wolfman""). In what appears to be medieval British Columbia Bridges plays Gregory a witch-hunting ""spook"" who once belonged to an elite group of knights all of whom have either died or yielded to the darkness. His apprentices dont fare much better as evidenced by an opening scene that doesnt work out so great for ""Game of Thrones"" star Kit Harington; nor does it bode well for future apprentice Tom Ward (Ben Barnes). For decades Gregory has grappled with a witch queen named Mother Malkin -- sort of a poor mans Maleficent made potentially interesting by the casting of Moore whose performance is then rendered too difficult to appreciate by a thick cloud of CGI noise as she constantly shape-shifts to and from dragon form. Mother Malkin derives power from the once-a-century Blood Moon whose return is a mere week away -- just enough time for Gregory to find and train a replacement assistant. The movie opens with Marco Beltramis orchestra at full blare swiftly yet clumsily setting up the scale of its widescreen world which alternates between ""Lord of the Rings""-like vistas and second-rate Sergio Leone-style compositions where characters who appear to have been shot against greenscreens are restaged against more dramatic backdrops. We meet Gregory drunk in a saloon -- a recycled version of the half-soused shootout that serves as Doc Hollidays introduction in ""Tombstone"" revealing a bit too much ""True Grit"" still stuck in his woolly billy-goat beard. Bridges is on his own weird wavelength here his L.A.-surfer-dude accent half buried beneath a pronounced underbite and a deep indistinct growl. It takes Bodrov and editors Jim Page and Paul Rubell nearly an hour to find the films rhythm. Fully 10 minutes pass before we meet Tom toiling away on his pig farm dreaming of bigger things. Older and far blander than we might expect the lad has strange almost epileptic visions of things to come conveyed through odd bleary montages that feel awkwardly inserted at first before disappearing entirely at the point in the story where wed expect them to become more important. Mostly he sees witches including a young one Alice (fittingly beguiling Swedish actress Alicia Vikander) who will play a vital role in the films final showdown. ""Seventh Sons"" producers have played it safe by employing top-class pros for nearly all the key below-the-line positions and yet the project crucially lacks an overarching vision. Maybe it had one that was elbowed out of the way by multiple writers (Charles Leavitt and Steven Knight working from ""Reign of Fire"" co-writer Matt Greenbergs screen story) test screenings or anxious execs. On the pictorial front production designer Dante Ferretti and costume queen Jacqueline West seem to be cribbing ideas from Tarsems discard pile while visual effects maestro John Dykstra takes Mother Malkins witch cronies (of which there are too many to keep track) through a series of too-quick transformations seldom lingering long enough for us to get a good look at the creatures they become. Ultimately ""Seventh Son"" has the cluttered feel of an over-designed under-conceived fantasy epic. As even the genre-spanning categorys most ardent admirers know its a rare alchemy by which these would-be franchises actually work. For every ""The Princess Bride"" there are countless misfires in which the ingredients seem to be there but the chemistry never sparks (e.g. ""Stardust"" ""The Mortal Instruments"" ""The Golden Compass""). Here its downright uncomfortable to watch an actor as good as Bridges fumbling lame one-liners while Barnes and Vikander struggle to generate the sort of heat required to accept them as star-crossed lovers from incompatible lines. Given the fine past work of its many parents there was clearly potential here but as delivered ""Seventh Son"" amounts to nothing short of a creative miscarriage.

Barbara says April 23 2015 at 257 am Dreadful - Over acted over produced - over everything I fell asleep before the end - overtired with it Reply Sean McBizzle says February 4 2015 at 321 pm THATS EXACTLY what i was gonna say.. STARDUST is amazing compared to the other two. A sweet movie by my standards MORE PRINCESS BRIDE than the Golden Compass for sure. Reply goodterling (goodterling) says January 27 2015 at 655 pm I cant believe you lumped Stardust in with Mortal Instruments and Golden Compass. That was a great self-aware flick that succeeded at nearly everything it attempted. Its not Princess Bride but what is? Reply Cleo says January 12 2015 at 828 am I watched this movie. Came out in south africa on the 10th of January. It was insanely predictable and overall pretty boring . Save yourself some money and skip out on it. Reply loco73 says December 20 2014 at 1159 pm Now as to the movie...yeah I saw the trailer almost a year ago and well lets just say that it lost me at the title...""Seventh Son""...oh boy Never a good sign when the title induces epileptic seizures And if you are still not covinced at how much this movie will suck...well just take a good long close luck at the picture above Hmm...that picture brings back horrible memories of ""RIPD"" The difference being that in this one Jeff Bridges wears a Jedi outfit and has a staff (or rod) instead of a cowboy hat and a Colt six-shooter PS Can anyone remind me why is Ryan Reynolds still employed? Reply jhs39 says December 17 2014 at 737 pm Seventh Son was completed and originally supposed to be released by Warner Brothers who didnt have much faith in it and wouldnt commit to a release date-it ended up going to Universal when Legendary severed its relationship with Warner Brothers-Warners wouldnt let the Godzilla movie go but they let Legendary take this one with them. Im surprised a reviewer from Variety wouldnt have more accurate information at his disposal for his review-apparently he doesnt read Variety. Reply loco73 says December 20 2014 at 1151 pm That was meant by the way to the moron above with the spam comment... LOL Reply Jane says December 17 2014 at 643 pm Please proofread and fix the typos. Reply Mjkbk says December 17 2014 at 639 pm Wait. The film takes place in ""medieval British Columbia""? WTF? Reply J.E. Vizzusi says December 17 2014 at 623 pm There was that time when Universal several attempts to recover from money woes could always count on their ""Monsters"". Maybe not so much anymore. I also thought Bridges awful attempt of the character Rooster Codburn was well behind him but maybe not either The word EPIC needs to be redined.
