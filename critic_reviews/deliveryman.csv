Especially compared to a lot of the crap that has been churning out lately. Not particularly fond of Vince Vaughns goofiness sometimes but thought he fit pretty well for this. You Mr Roeper sounded as if you didnt care much it. I saw Starbuck and dont remember barely anything about it. I would normally never write this and before I felt compelled to I clicked on over to see that you had rated the newly released ""Gravity"" an ""A+"". Felt I had no choice now. Think it tells much more of you than the films and would bet that all those people with an apparent above average ability of thought ones who are not caught in awe when their starfield screensaver pops up because they struggle with why their pen wont write on the notepad will remember Mr. Roeper said it was the ""best of the year."" imi designosaid on Friday December 06 2013 11156 PMHaving seen director Ken Scotts original French Canadian film ""Starbuck"" last year it was jarring watching this (almost shot for shot) remake of his own film. I wish someone pulled old clips of Siskel and Ebert and Ebert amp; Roeper critiquing filmmakers on unnecessary remakes of good films for Mr Scott. In this case none of the benefits of having a bigger budget well known actors or greater New York locations showed up on screen. Sadly Mr Scott cut a crucial fertility clinic prologue scene from the original (which Stern fans would appreciate) but he added a sappy (unnecessary) final hospital scene to the remake. The original film was better acted more intricate in terms of shot selection and transitions pacing was better it was touching and perhaps less funny and the color pallette was perfect for Montreal and to represent the ""feeling"" of what a man in that situation would be. I suspect if these two movies appeared on Netflix together at some point the original film would kick the view count ass of the remake. kathy braxtonsaid on Saturday November 30 2013 102613 AMgreat feel good movie .....4 stars DCWhatthesaid on Monday November 25 2013 82511 PMIntellectually maybe Roeper is right about this film. But I loved it. I thought this was Vinces best of his recent films. Cried several times. My wife also enjoyed it though not as much. Justin Hamakersaid on Friday November 22 2013 105019 PMI found Delivery Man to a pleasant movie but nothing substantial. I would have liked to see the movie go deeper into the relationships he develops with his children. The small number who we are introduced to are never really developed beyond the basic sketch of a character and the story never revisits the conflicts that brought them together with David. I also think the movie missed an opportunity by not exploring some of the sibling relationships. POST A COMMENT indicates required fieldName Email Website YouTubeResponse URL  ?

"Delivery Man | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; delivery-man ) Delivery Man (United States 2013) November 22 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli Calling Delivery Man a ""comedy"" is a bit of a stretch because its rarely funny. Dumb yes but not in a way thats worthy of more than a half-hearted chuckle. Then again it functions even worse as a ""drama"" because the production insults the viewer at regular intervals with inept manipulation. French Canadian director Ken Scott remaking his own foreign-language film (which was called Starbuck when released into art houses in 2011) exhibits little aptitude for making viewers laugh or cry although hes pretty good when it comes to stimulating the gag reflex. Vince Vaughns performance is confusing. I cant decide whether he was simply disinterested or whether he thought using this kind of a low-key approach was the appropriate way to breathe life into his loser of a character Dave. Whatever the case Vaughn spends the entire film seeming tired. The energy that normally invigorates even his worst efforts is entirely lacking. Although one can debate the reasons why Vaughn acts the way he does the end result is that Dave comes across as beaten down - a condition that persists after the supposed ""uplifting"" scenes. The real problem isnt Vaughns portrayal; its the script which is so loaded down with artifice that it never has a chance to stay afloat let alone soar. The premise is pregnant with possibilities none of which are effectively realized. The backstory decrees that some 20 years in the past a cash-strapped Dave made money by donating more than 600 semen samples to a fertility clinic. Something went wrong (or maybe that should be ""right"") and Dave ended up as the biological father of more than 500 children 140+ of whom have filed a lawsuit to overturn a confidentiality agreement and learn Daves identity. Meanwhile Daves personal life is in turmoil. His girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) is pregnant but doesnt want to see him until he ""finds a life."" He owes 80000 to loan sharks who are eager to collect. And the only lawyer he can afford is his sadsack friend Brett (Chris Pratt) who has never argued a big case. However intrigued by the situation Dave obtains personality profiles for some of his kids and begins visiting them in secret stalking them and revealing himself only as a helpful stranger as circumstances dictate. Aside from the failed humor (as when Dave pretends not to be able to speak English when a lawyer visits him in his apartment) Delivery Mans most notable failing is the clumsy way in which Daves ""encounters"" with his children are orchestrated. The contrivances infecting these scenes are impossible to camouflage so the filmmakers dont make much of an attempt to try. Scott insists on following up one hard-to-swallow scene with another and this doesnt help development of The Big Emotional Payoff. The moment of catharsis is haphazard and in addition to being predictable doesnt deliver in the way a sappy saccharine-laden scene of this sort should. Significant portions of Delivery Man seem designed to irritate viewers rather than entertain them. Theyre the cinematic equivalent of poison ivy. The loan shark subplot is an unwanted intrusion that serves no obvious purpose beyond establishing a plot point (why Dave would sue the fertility clinic). Viggo (Adam Chanler-Berat) the guy who learns about Daves identity via one of the many coincidences is so aggravating that his inclusion makes scenes borderline-watchable. Is he supposed to be funny? Delivery Man stands accused of getting the least imaginable mileage out of an idea that could be spun into an intriguing emotionally satisfying narrative. It also misuses its lead actor by putting him in a role that focuses on his on-camera weaknesses rather than his strengths. The studio probably doesnt have much hope for Delivery Man - opening it opposite Catching Fire is not a vote of confidence. It doesnt deserve one either. As a feel-good audience pleaser this is tepid. As anything else its rancid.

Adam Nayman Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 22 2013 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 22 2013 1200AM EST Comments AA Directed by Ken Scott Written by Ken Scott Martin Petit Starring Vince Vaughn Cobie Smulders Chris Pratt Classification PG Year 2013 Country USA Language English By now too obviously middle-aged to convincingly play a Swinger or a Wedding Crasher Vince Vaughn tries fatherhood on for size in Delivery Man.Quebec director Ken Scotts glossy yet mediocre redux of his own 2011 French-language hit Starbuck - a film that was not crying out for a remake - casts Vaughn as David Wozniak a cash-strapped fortysomething loser who drives a meat truck for his fathers delicatessen. His unsettled life gets thrown even further out of whack when hes informed that because of a fertility-clinic mix-up hes the biological father of 533 children. Whats more his heirs who are all in their early 20s have banded together to file a class-action paternity suit in the hopes of uncovering the secret of their shared heritage. Handout Video Video Weekend movie pick Short Term 12 will change your view on millennials Handout Video Video Weekend movie pick Blue is the Warmest Colour is raw beautiful There is a relatable theme couched in this comically outlandish premise that of self-improvement. Davids panic over the legal ramifications of a discovery that makes him the worlds most infamous - while for the moment still anonymous - deadbeat dad gives way to a sense of responsibility toward his progeny. With this in mind Delivery Man can be pegged as yet another in a seemingly endless series of Apatow-era man-child redemption stories as David lurches toward self-improvement by acting as a self-styled self-effacing ""guardian angel"" to his children most of whom seem to conveniently live around the block from him in New York. (Except for a couple of extra-gawky geek types all of Davids kids look like models; perhaps the organizers of the Miss World pageant got their contestants a group rate back in the days when David was making regular deposits at the sperm bank.)Decked out in a slovenly array of sweatshirts and sports jerseys Vaughn tweaks his usual overgrown-frat-boy-act slightly; this time out his sleazy charm is accompanied by anxious strains of self-deprecation which he gamely attempts to underact. Vaughn also generously cedes most of the funniest lines to Chris Pratt as his best pal/lawyer - a pudgy divorcee whose hangdog resignation in the presence of his four shrieking children is consistently good for a laugh. Pratt one of the MVPs of NBCs Parks and Recreation provides the sort of confident relaxed comic performance that gives an otherwise mediocre movie a lift. Unfortunately the casts other prime-time player How I Met Your Mothers Cobie Smulders is wasted in a perfunctory girlfriend role; her only job plot-wise is to get knocked up so David can agonize over the best way to do right by his illegitimate children without losing his shot at a more conventional kind of fatherhood.Pratt and Smulders both fit seamlessly into Delivery Mans small-screen style At times it feels as if were watching a Very Special (and very long) episode of a mediocre sitcom. The directors avoidance of anything resembling innovative framing or editing will probably pay off when Delivery Man eventually airs on television where the flimsiness of its jokes and ""serious"" moments alike should feel less conspicuous. Perhaps the broadcaster will be kind enough to add a laugh track in all the places where the gags fall flat.

Youre all set Sign up Invalid email address Got it Got it David Wozniak (Vince Vaughn) has a big family including from left Kristen (Britt Robertson) Taylor (Amos VanderPoel) and Josh (Jack Reynor) in ""Delivery Man."" (Jessica Miglio) By Michael OSullivan November 21 2013 To paraphrase Yogi Berra ""Delivery Man"" is deja vu all over again. It seems like only eight months ago I was reviewing ""Starbuck"" a charming little feel-good film by Ken Scott based on the true story of a sperm donor who wakes up to discover he has fathered 533 adorable kids. And now here I am again a mere 238 days later (but whos counting?) reviewing ""Delivery Man"" a charming little feel-good film by Ken Scott based on the true story of a sperm donor who wakes up to discover he has fathered 533 adorable kids. The plot is set in motion when the sperm donor learns that 142 of his offspring have filed a class-action lawsuit seeking to lift his veil of anonymity. Whats the difference between the two films? Other than that Scott -- yes remaking his own perfectly good French- Canadian movie in English -- has replaced actor Patrick Huard with Vince Vaughn not much. ""Starbuck"" was a funny and warm-hearted trifle. So is ""Delivery Man."" If anything ""Delivery Man"" boasts a more clever and less confusing title. ""Starbuck"" took its name not from the coffee company but from the pseudonym used by sperm donor David Wozniak (Huard/Vaughn) -- an obscure inside joke referencing the name of a famously fertile Holstein bull. There are some other minor changes. All of the soccer references in the first movie which is set in Quebec have been changed to basketball references in the new film which is set in Brooklyn. And Chris Pratt who plays Davids genially incompetent lawyer Brett is actually a bit funnier than Antoine Bertrand who played the part in the first film. Thats nice because Vaughn is actually a teensy bit less lovable than Huard. Lets call it a draw. Not that Vaughn is miscast or that his reading of the character is too misanthropic by any means. He nails Davids Peter Pan syndrome for one thing but is equally fine at evoking the characters unexpected paternalism. David becomes surprisingly protective after he starts stalking some of the kids all of whom are in their late teens and early 20s (and who apparently were cast from a cattle call audition seeking the most wholesome young actors and actresses in the known universe). Adam Chanler-Berat is particularly good as Viggo a ""Starbuck"" progeny who discovers his biological fathers identity early on but protects Davids anonymity so he can have him all to himself. In the process David also discovers that it takes more than sperm to be a dad. And that after all is what ""Delivery Man"" is about not just children searching for a father but a father searching for the meaning of the term itself. Its especially lovely to see David interact silently with his profoundly disabled son. The wordless performance by Sebastien Rene who played that character in both movies is a guaranteed tearjerker. One other weird thing hasnt changed The only major female characters are Davids pregnant girlfriend (Cobie Smulders) and one of his daughters (Britt Robertson). Davids mother? Deceased. The wives of Brett and Davids two brothers (Bobby Moynihan and Simon Delaney)? Theyre never seen or heard from. And the 533 women who actually used Davids sperm and who presumably conceived carried gave birth to and raised his children? Its as if they were all killed in a freak ferry accident. For Scott motherhood seems to be a less critical component of parenting than fatherhood at least from a narrative standpoint. I get it. Turnabout is fair play. So many movies treat fathers as invisible expendable or irrelevant. Its only to be expected for a movie to come along every now and again that does the same thing with mothers. Yet all this does is to place ""Delivery Man"" despite its roots in a true story squarely in the realm of male fantasy.   1/2 PG-13. At area theaters.

Slowly. He has a low-level job purely out of charity with the family business. He has a girlfriend whos sick of him with good reason. Hes in debt to loan sharks and his loft isnt just filled with pot plants but dead pot plants. He cant it seems do anything right. Well he can do one thing. One basic primal thing. Davids got very very hardy sperm. And thanks to his busy days 20 years ago donating -- OK selling -- it hes suddenly discovered he has a kid. Actually a few kids. OK actually -- over 500 kids. Who all want to get to know who their mystery dad was. This is the setup for ""Delivery Man"" a movie you might remember as the 2011 Canadian film ""Starbuck."" Not enough people remember it though -- or at least so hopes the studio - because they hired the original filmmaker to Americanize it. The new film has a few things going for it. For once -- and this is funny given the nationality of the director -- this is not a film trying to pass off Toronto as NYC. The locations are real (even if the real estate the characters have is unreal) and that gives the film some charm and reality. Theres also been a determined effort to clean up what could be a pretty sleazy story -- even if some vestiges of dirty jokes remain. (Wozniaks workaday job is -- um -- delivering meat.) For example our heros debts are put down to bad business investments (instead of say sports gambling which fits his character much better). His pot-dealing is treated as a joke and other situations -- a teens heroin addiction - are given easy-fix solutions. Its nice that the film ends on an upbeat note. But the heartwarming thermostat is frequently jacked up to 90 and the big court case the story ends with is a tired comedy cliche. That said Vince Vaughn is fine as Wozniak although it would have been smarter if the film had given him more chance to do the sort of seat-of-his-pants prevaricating hes so good at. Even better is Chris Pratt as his lawyer; a stealthy supporting player Pratts a slightly saner-looking Seann William Scott making every comedy hes in better. Good too is Britt Robertson as one of Wozniaks most vulnerable progeny -- shes all furtive energy and huge eyes -- and the small gang of young children who play Pratts calmly out-of-control kids. What they cant do though is turn this promising if porn-y situation into an honestly touching film. Vaughn never quite convinces as the perpetual slacker in this blue-collar family (he doesnt even look like hes from the same gene pool) and too many of the characters feel puppeteered into place; you can see all the strings. As a big New York comedy ""Delivery Man"" brings some nice shots of the city and provides a couple of good performances and a few smiles. But like its heros claim to fame the performance and the smiles are forced and fleeting and afterwards all you want to do is slink home. Ratings note The film contains drug and sexual references strong language and brief violence. Delivery Man (PG-13) Touchstone (103 min.) Directed by Ken Scott. With Vince Vaughn Chris Pratt.

Not five good jokes or five edgy jokes or five memorable jokes. Just five jokes. (And for the record two of them are okay.) But we probably shouldnt even call it a comedy. Its more a sentimental fable albeit one with an absurdist and absurdly high concept What happens if an aimless irresponsible fortysomething who made hundreds of donations to a sperm bank in his youth learns one day that he has 533 kids? You may have images dancing in your head of wacky interactions between our hero and his hundreds of offspring catastrophic misunderstandings and hilarious lies stacked high like pancakes but no. Delivery Man is simple but serious sensitive but ridiculous. Because of some legal shenanigans David Wozniak (Vaughn) has to maintain his anonymity but he starts going through the list of his kids trying to secretly connect with them. The first child Dave uncovers turns out to be an NBA star. The next turns out to be a struggling actor and jerky bartender. Then theres the beautiful junkie. The street musician. The African-American manicurist. We get a few minutes with each of these kids and then its on to the next one. At one point one of Daves more intellectual kids (he wears black and quotes Tolstoy see?) uncovers the secret but wants this father figure all to himself so he moves in; you think the movies about to settle into a more standard getting-to-know-you and/or odd-couple plot but this thread is eventually discarded as well. Even Daves pregnant girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) supposedly a motivating factor in his decision to become a responsible father just pops in whenever its convenient for the story. (If you said this character had been belatedly written into the film Id believe you.) At least Emma gets more screen time than the loan sharks to whom Dave allegedly owes money. The movie cant be bothered with the story its set itself up to tell. The above descriptions do no justice to how strange a movie Delivery Man is. An example After Dave brings one daughter (Britt Robertson) a junkie to the hospital following an overdose he has to decide between signing her out (which is what she wants) and signing her up for rehab (which is what a kindly doctor wants). Its a tense serious little scene as Dave walks back and forth between the doctor and the daughter torn about the first actual parental decision of his life -- except that director Ken Scott overlays some jaunty dunk-dunk-dunkdunkdunk music over the scene which throws us. Wait you find yourself asking is this supposed to be funny? Still there are sweet moments amid the atonal chaos. Id be lying if I said I didnt tear up at Daves interactions with one particular child a severely disabled man who seems to have been abandoned in a nursing home. Daves own father (played by Andrzej Blumenfeld) a Polish immigrant gets some touching scenes as well. The couple of decent laughs in the film come from Chris Pratt playing Daves schlubby lawyer friend Brett who agrees to help him in the class-action lawsuit that 142 of his kids have filed demanding to know his identity. But even the jokes in this alleged comedy feel like theyve been airlifted in from somewhere else. Vaughn has done this kind of genre bait-and-switch before to varying results The Break-Up was marketed as a wacky romantic comedy only to turn out to be a (not entirely unwelcome) comedy-drama about the difficulty of moving on after the end of a relationship. Delivery Man is a lot less certain about what it wants to be. Nothing quite seems to fit as if the movies been assembled from bits and pieces of other movies. That could describe a lot of movies today but Delivery Man feels more unformed as if nobodys bothered to give it that extra coat of slick Hollywood paint to cover up the patchwork beneath. One final word on Vince Vaughn I like the guy I really do. And in Delivery Man he maintains his usual veneer of sluggish charm throughout. But how odd that an actor who once had such boundless chatty energy - back in the days of Swingers and Made - is today known for playing slobby slothful slackers? Hes not particularly animated here either. He doesnt need to be but I sure do miss the fast-talking dynamo that exploded onto movie screens so many years ago. Watching him now I just feel old.

Cobie Smulders stars as Emma in DreamWorks Pictures heartfelt comedy ""Delivery Man."" Photo Jessica Miglio Walt Disney Pictures Delivery Man review Infertile array of cliches 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Delivery Man Comedy. Starring Vince Vaughn Chris Pratt Cobie Smulders and Andrzej Blumenfeld. Directed by Ken Scott. (PG-13. 103 minutes.) ""Delivery Man"" is nowhere near the worst film of 2013 but it is definitely the most exhausting. The main character seems to exist in 36-hour days without any sleep. There appear to be montages within the montages. The sperm-donor-acting-as-guardian-angel plot is like watching six seasons of ""Highway to Heaven"" crammed into one 103-minute sitting. The biggest problem is a punishing script piling on so many cliches that reality begins to feel warped. Meanwhile the actors do little to mask the deficiencies. This is a film that a 2000s Will Ferrell or early 1980s Eddie Murphy might have willed into being funny. Present-day Vince Vaughn doesnt stand a chance. Vaughn is David a meat delivery guy who is terrible at his job but still beloved in the family business because hes such a nice guy. It says something about the predictability of the screenplay that David owes 80000 to the mob and has a girlfriend who announces shes pregnant at his lowest moment. David donated sperm 18-plus years ago under the pseudonym Starbuck and now more than 100 of his 533 children want to know who he is. ""Delivery Man"" is a copy of the 2011 French-Canadian film ""Starbuck"" which had the same writer/director but benefited from an ""R"" rating and indie sensibility. (""Delivery Man"" just barely grazes the lower edges of PG-13 with mild masturbation and drug references. Watching this family-friendly film its hard to imagine that ""Jaws"" was once a PG movie.) The screenplay repeatedly relies on logical gymnastics to move the action forward. ""Delivery Man"" is the type of movie where a character decides to file a lawsuit and in the next scene his lawyer is working out his closing arguments - which end up being three sentences long. Worst of all is the unfounded decision to make Starbuck a national pariah. At a time when a celebrity known for a sex tape can end up with her own clothing line the guy who fathered 533 children would be more beloved than Mr. Rogers. Vaughn is strangely subdued in the role which would normally be a blessing. But with very little scripted humor a force-of-nature performance was the best chance to save the film. Most of the humor is based on Davids constant stress. The jokes often miss and all we have left is that harried tension. There are other times when the comic and dramatic momentum is left to the musical score a blend of pianos and strings seemingly mixed extra loud so audiences never forget how theyre supposed to feel. Two of the smaller performances help to make the film tolerable Chris Pratt is well used as Brett Davids sad-sack best friend and incompetent lawyer. (His four humorously blunt children turn out to be a nice Greek chorus.) Andrzej Blumenfeld is wonderful as Davids father Mikolaj. The actor whose career was built overseas steals every scene hes in with a gruff-but-loving paternal understanding that he can convey with a gesture. This must be Polands Paul Dooley.

"Review In Delivery Man Vince Vaughn grows up with the help of 533 kids - LA Times Movies Now ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Movies Now Review In Delivery Man Vince Vaughn grows up with the help of 533 kids Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Vince Vaughn and his new movie ""Delivery Man"" have me rethinking my vow to avoid using the description ""feel-good"" before the word ""movie"" at all costs.This is Vaughn at his most vulnerable. As much as the wisecracking actor at a different point in his career might have bristled at the description ""Delivery Man"" a heart-tugging new comedy about fatherhood and family is warm as well as wry. Yes this is a slight film. But theres a very likable ensemble around Vaughn led by ""Parks and Recreations"" Chris Pratt as his best friend Brett along with wonderful Polish actor Andrzej Blumenfeld as his father Mikolaj. And Vaughns more emotional side put to such fine angry use in ""The Break-Up"" opposite Jennifer Aniston in 2006 is much more in play.On the set movies and TV So lets just say whatever your mood going in you will likely feel a good deal better coming out.The movie turns on the identity confusion spawned by new-age reproductive technology. In this case 142 of the 533 kids sired by a single anonymous sperm donor want to find out who their daddy is. Years ago the guy gave extensively -- and effectively -- under the name ""Starbuck."" His real name is David Wozniak (Vaughn).An endearing underachiever who drives the delivery van for his familys Brooklyn butchering business David is cut from the same cloth as many of Vaughns characters. After 1996s ""Swingers"" his breakout the actor became one of Hollywoods go-to guys for edgy loser-types made lovable by dead-pan comic riffs -- a Vaughn specialty. ""Old School"" in 2003 and the ""Wedding Crashers"" smash in 2005 were high points followed by a growing number of lows.PHOTOS Billion-dollar movie club At first glance David seems like all the rest. But writer-director Ken Scott builds a more complex character with a series of emotional arcs designed to force the quintessential Vaughn man-child to grow up. For fans of the 2011 French Canadian ""Starbuck"" on which ""Delivery Man"" is based Scott has refined the story without losing the baby or the bath water. Indeed some of the slapstick is exactly the same. (Scott directed and co-wrote ""Starbuck"" with Martin Petit.)As the film opens David is a man under siege -- a huge debt is owed to some questionable characters. Hes the familys favorite whipping boy disappointing dad and his two younger brothers Victor (Simon Delaney) and Aleksy (""SNLs"" Bobby Moynihan) on a daily basis. Still they adore him.Girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) announces shes pregnant when he shows up at her front door after being missing in action for a while. A by-the-book New York City cop she essentially puts him on fatherhood probation.PHOTOS Celebrities by The TimesAnd then there is the matter of the 533 kids hes just found out he fathered.When Davids served with a class-action suit to unmask Starbucks identity it comes with a packet filled with 142 pages -- the faces and profiles of the progeny who want to meet him. Brett an overwhelmed single father of four and an underqualified attorney takes his friends case and issues a warning to never look inside. But like Pandoras box the urge is impossible to resist the result impossible to contain.As so often happens in the real world having kids forces even the most reluctant to grow up David included. When he starts showing up in a few of the kids lives -- still anonymous -- so does a sense of responsibility. They come in all colors. Some are gay. One is disabled. All have issues. Stereotypes abound.PHOTOS Greatest box office flopsA few of them are singled out for the purpose of putting David through the parenting ringer. The most skillfully drawn are Britt Robertsons young woman on the edge Dave Pattens struggling street musician Sebastien Renes silent wheelchair-using teen and Adam Chanler-Berats needy goth the one who actually moves in and proceeds to drive David crazy with existential debates.The film shifts frequently between Davids very traditional tight-knit Polish family headed by Mikolajs benevolent patriarch the nontraditional one that is forming around the donor kids and his future family with Emma. The life lessons are nearly as numerous as the offspring which puts Vaughn in almost every scene and keeps the ideas from being explored very deeply.Still it works to get the actor out of his post-""Old School"" and ""Wedding Crashers"" rut. While Scotts light touch makes Davids maturing entertaining whats more fun is watching Vaughn the actor come into his own.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com ----------------------------Delivery ManMPAA rating PG-13 for thematic elements sexual content some drug material brief violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 43 minutesPlaying In general release PHOTOS AND MORE PHOTOS Faces to watch 2014 | Movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz DOCUMENTARIES 10 best of 2013 and a new crop in 2014 Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Entertainment Movies Vince Vaughn Ridley Scott Reviews Starbuck (movie) Human Interest Vince Vaughn I havent gone soft The Internship now starring ...

Its not his fault the movie isnt funny; hes affable enough in this remake of the 2011 French Canadian film Starbuck. Both comedies were written and directed by Ken Scott but the first films charm seems lost in translation.Vaughn plays David Wozniak a meat truck driver (insert off-color joke here) who made an inordinate amount of anonymous donations to a fertility clinic two decades before the film opens. Unbeknownst to him his sperm was of the highest grade and the clinic offered it up repeatedly resulting in those 500-plus offspring.REVIEWS The latest movie reviews from USA TODAYTRAILERS Coming soon to theatersHOLIDAY MOVIE CALENDAR NovemberHis progeny are in their early 20s now and 142 of them have filed a class-action lawsuit requesting the identity of their anonymous father be revealed. He called himself ""Starbuck"" for the clinics purposes.Though David is a delivery man by profession he doesnt deliver much of a stable presence for his police officer girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders). And he disappoints his brothers and father all too often with his irresponsibility. He operates a small marijuana-growing business on the side in order to pay off debts he somehow incurred with some nebulous mobsters.He does however manage to do OK by several of his spawn. Once he finds out who they are through his buddy and lawyer Brett (Chris Pratt) he makes a point to visit them incognito and try to improve their lives.That nary a mother of these twentysomethings pops up seems a glaring omission. In fact moms are AWOL in the entire movie. David and his brothers dont have one and while Brett has four children their mother is conspicuously absent. The story is essentially Two Men and 500 Babies.The concepts execution is sloppy full of inconsistencies and plot holes. The situations teeter on funny but never achieve it. And sections meant to be heartwarming feel lukewarm far-fetched or inappropriately comical.One of Davids children is a young woman who suffers a drug overdose. Her addiction is played for laughs in one scene. Though a doctor recommends rehab for her heroin use David signs her out simply because she promises to show up for a new job. Poof Shes all better.One gag in which he tries to hide his identity by speaking Spanish (repeating ""Yo no soy David Wozniak"") is worth a smile initially but grows grating with repetition.If anyone would be capable of wringing laughs out of this conceit Vaughn would seem a likely candidate at least given his hilarious performance in Wedding Crashers.Yet the forced narrative doesnt match the caliber of the casting. The movie veers between broad farce and sappy melodrama detouring early and often into unlikely coincidence territory. In one sequence David follows one of the kids into a hotel conference room where the Starbuck descendants just happen to be holding a meeting about him. How convenient.As conceived Delivery Man works way too hard to be the feel-good movie of the year. If only it had just focused on being funny. 14 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//usat.ly/I6nUVZHoliday Movies Calendar NovemberTake a look at the films heading to the box office this November complete with trailers reviews previews and more.

Photo Credit AP advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An overgrown underachiever discovers his sperm bank donations have produced 533 children. Rated PG-13 (thematic elements sexual content some drug material brief violence and language) BOTTOM LINE An awfully cutesy-wutesy comedy but its familial sentiments feel genuine and Vaughns charm is still potent. CAST Vince Vaughn Chris Pratt Cobie Smulders LENGTH 143 There are big happy families and then there is the humongous joyous family of David Wozniak the hero of ""Delivery Man."" Its the story of an amiable underachiever who discovers his anonymous sperm-bank donations have resulted in 533 children 142 of whom are now suing to learn his identity. If your first horrified thought is ""child support"" then youre probably too cynical to enjoy this overly sweet but heart-tugging comedy. ""Delivery Man"" is writer-director Ken Scotts remake of his French Canadian comedy ""Starbuck"" (named after a famously studly Ontario bull) which sneaked into U.S. theaters earlier this year. The Hollywood version features tweaks big and small -- lead actor Vince Vaughn replaces Patrick Huard while Brooklyn replaces Montreal -- but the story and subplots remain the same. David still drives a truck for the family meatpacking business (his Polish dad is played by a delightful Andrzej Blumenfeld) and he still has a pregnant girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) who doesnt consider him father material. Ah if only she knew. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Determined to prove her wrong David begins devoting time to his offspring but without revealing his identity. This seems unwise to Davids lawyer friend Brett (Chris Pratt) who barks out the unusual advice ""Stop seeing your kids"" David however cant resist touching the lives of aspiring actor Josh (Jack Reynor) emotionally needy Viggo (Adam Chanler-Berat) and drug-addicted Kristen (Britt Robertson). David also has a well-adjusted gay son whom the film treats rather gingerly Hes a montage never a character. One drop of dramatic rain in all the sunshine is Ryan (Sebastien Rene reprising his role) who is in a wheelchair and unable to communicate. Upon seeing him David nearly flees -- a base instinct but a believable one. As it turns out this particular father-son relationship though only briefly explored says more about David than any other. Its all very slick and predictable but Vaughns charm is still potent and the overall surplus of heart is hard to resist. Essentially ""Delivery Man"" is one very very large group hug. 231 MoviesDelivery Man trailer PLOT An overgrown underachiever discovers his sperm bank donations have produced 533 children. advertisement | advertise on newsday RATING PG-13 (thematic elements sexual content some drug material brief violence and language) CAST Vince Vaughn Chris Pratt Cobie Smulders LENGTH 143 BOTTOM LINE An awfully cutesy-wutesy comedy but its familial sentiments feel genuine and Vaughns charm is still potent. 142 MoviesHoliday movie trailers Sign up for Newsdays Entertainment newsletter Get the latest on celebs TV and more. submit Click here to read or post comments Comments Newsday.com now uses Facebook for our comment boards.

To read the whole story subscribe to BostonGlobe.com Delivery Man Share Comment ""Delivery Man"" offers a kinder gentler Vince Vaughn in a pleasantly ramshackle comedy several rungs below his usual fare in both budget and high-concept assault tactics. A remake of the 2011 French-Canadian film ""Starbuck"" -- with co-writer/director Ken Scott photocopying his own movie -- it casts the star as a kind-hearted loser who learns he has 533 grown children sired from sperm he donated two decades earlier. And 142 are suing to learn his identity. What does he do? Stalks them and sets about secretly improving their lives of course. The movie is predictable but likeable schmaltzy but sweet and Vaughn in low-voltage mode wins you over. Like his character the film is kind of a dog -- but a nice one that licks your face.

November 21 2013 -- 247pm Jessica Miglio DreamWorks Vince Vaughn in a scene from ""Delivery Man."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Colin Covert colincovert Is there a statute of limitations on being a man-child? Vince Vaughn now 43 his brow wrinkled and his torso thickened with age has his ""Swingers"" days far behind him. Yet in ""Delivery Man"" he plays an eternal adolescent unprepared for adult responsibilities shocked to learn that a long-ago stint as a sperm donor has made him the unwitting father of some 500 full-grown offspring. The introductory shot of his slob apartment littered with toy soldiers overdue bills and paper airplanes could be amusing if it belonged to a younger man. But for a man in middle age whose hairline is in full retreat its just sad. ""Delivery Man"" a comedy in theory is a remake of a sweet French-Canadian feature titled ""Starbuck"" with the charm lost in translation. The low-key appeal of the original is replaced here by aggressive mugging a rinky-dink ""funny"" score fake uplift and an overall air of feeble banality. Vaughns character Dave Wozniak is a truck driver for his familys wholesale meat company. But hes really the same immature bachelor he played in ""The Internship"" and ""The Watch"" and pretty much all the rest of his films. I think he actually wears the identical wardrobe of old T-shirts and zip-up hoodies in every role. Cobie Smulders plays Vaughns love interest whom he has impregnated the old-fashioned way. She rightly sees little potential in this schlub and wants to raise the child solo. Dave promises to become a worthy parent. He learns the basics of the job through fly-by interactions with some of his many kids. Hes able to do this unrecognized because confidentiality agreements keep his identity as a fertility clinic contributor under wraps a secret status many of his children are challenging in a class-action suit. DELIVERY MAN 1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for thematic elements sexual content some drug material brief violence and language. His best friend and semi-competent attorney Chris Pratt defends his anonymity practicing his big summation speech at home in suit coat and undershorts. By the standards of ""Delivery Man"" this is a knee-slapping laugh. Overnight Dave becomes an inspiring father figure -- the broods self-proclaimed ""guardian angel"" -- with advice and hugs for every kid he encounters. So healing is his influence that he turns one daughter from a heroin addict to a clean perky career gal in a blink. Those are some powerful hugs. Cue the montage of bonding breakthroughs. Writer/director Ken Scott is responsible for both the agreeable original ""Starbuck"" and this watered-down do-over. One can only wonder what loss of creative control was imposed on him for this opportunity to play in the big leagues. Lets hope it was worth dishonoring the memory of his own film. Theres a lot more artificial here than the insemination. Colin Covert has covered films for the Star Tribune for 20 years interviewing Peter Jackson Kate Winslet Steven Spielberg Cate Blanchett Quentin Tarantino Neil Gaiman and John Travolta to name a few. Colins job as a film critic consists mostly of thinking up synonyms for ""mediocre."" He still gets a thrill when the lights dim and all too often a bigger thrill when they come on again.

In other words it looks like a film you dont have to think too hard about one offering a few laughs and wrapping up with some facile ""message"" about work or relationships. A film that happens to star a veritable giant. Amazingly ""Delivery Man"" is not this style of movie not even remotely. In Vince Vaughns latest work comedy isnt the goal even though our main character David (Vaughn) is a guy who is biologically responsible for 533 children 142 of whom have filed a lawsuit to ascertain his identity. I repeat none of this idea is played for yucks. Instead its played for... not yucks. Indeed the surprisingly serious ""Delivery Man"" which finds French-Canadian director Ken Scott remaking / dubbing his previous film ""Starbuck"" is a film that strives to make you think and even tug at your heart. But the central foundation of the entire enterprise is so shaky that the walls and plaster are falling down all around you even as youre trying to make sense of it all. So why and when do things get so severe? Right after the initial idea is presented really. 533 times over Davids sperm was successfully used to inseminate a woman. A lawyer from the clinic has come to deliver this sobering news mostly so David can say over and over ""Yo no soy David"". And truly David has been asked to emotionally handle something that no one in the world would be equipped to deal with and because of this ""Delivery Man"" attempts to pull of a magic trick only after each attempt it then sways back for some prat falls just in case you like that sort of thing. Ill run you through a few examples. This David is a swell guy for wanting to do right by his biological children But he owes money to mobsters. Why this is a movie about privacy law Only Davids lawyer friend Brett (Chris Pratt) isnt any good at lawyering. David is going to improve the lives of his newly discovered children Only the sheer logistics of that would preclude any sort of existence that involved a job or any other relationships. Lets take a dive into sperm donor rights Nope we cant because we need to have something in there about Brians love life instead. With each pivot from comedy to drama and back again ""Delivery Man"" gets lost in this murky middle ground never quite nailing any genre in particular. That said the actual central problem at the core of ""Delivery Man"" is the great big question mark hanging over the whole affair the giant teddy bear in the room that everyone is willfully ignoring. It goes something like this Why in the world would David feel anything other than horrified hurt and angry that a negligent sperm bank had used his erm materials to make over 500 babies? At what point would anyone in the uinverse say ""You know I realize that the people who had these children used an anonymous donor on purpose but they probably really meant for me to be the dad to their son or daughter decades after the fact."" This only makes sense in a little place I like to call ""Bonkersville"". Biology is not parenting at least not in the case where youve never met the offspring the parents or really had anything to do with their lives right up until the point the movie started. ""Delivery Man"" takes pains to show that well some of these children want to know who their real dad is. Sounds reasonable enough  Theres a good film in the idea of donor rights privacy and nature vs. nurture but that film would be intimate and heartfelt not broad and bawdy. And yes theres also a solid comedy motion picture where a guy has 500 kids but that film wouldnt bother going into the courtroom or into various sob stories or have its main character being leaned on by loan sharks. ""Delivery Man"" is the sort of film youd get if pen pals were switching off writing a film with each new letter only both of them wanted to go a different direction an exquisite corpse thats all left feet and elbows. The film routinely comes apart at the seams which is a shame because at very specific moments it was funny and at other times it did deliver on thought-provoking drama (hey Im as surprised as you are). Overall if ""Delivery Man"" were a real estate transaction youd be tempted to call it a ""total tear down"". Youd sort of eyeball the den and think maybe it was worth salvaging or the garage or the swing set out back. But everything would have just a little too much wear too little modern thought put into the build or perhaps not quite be up to code. Its a film with a lot of promise even with its bad premise only it never quite figures out what its trying to say lost in the din of 142 voices all clamoring for attention. SCORE 5.0 / 10 Laremy wrote the book on film criticism and thinks even one child would be pretty overwhelming.

Lost in translation Delivery Man review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesLost in translation Delivery Man reviewIn theory the Starbuck remake Delivery Man should be at least as funny as the Quebec original it follows so closely. Except its not. Vince Vaughn stars in Delivery Man a remake of Quebec comedy Starbuck.  (Jessica Miglio / Disney/Dreamworks)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 21 2013Delivery ManStarring Vince Vaughn Colbie Smulders and Chris Pratt. Directed by Ken Scott. Opens Nov. 22. See Star listings for theatres and show times. 105 minutes. PGLightning fails to strike twice with Delivery Man a rough Quebec comedy run through the Hollywood mill and thats the really funny thing about it.Not funny ha-ha. More like funny hmmm ...Article Continued BelowIts the English-language remake of Starbuck the Genie-winning 2011 francophone laugher about an overachieving sperm donor and his underachieving life. The movie was co-written by Ken Scott and also directed by him.Scott wangled a deal with Steven Spielberg Disney and other Hollywood concerns to essentially do a beat-for-beat shot-for-shot anglophone makeover moving the action from Montreal to Brooklyn. In theory it should be at least as funny Starbuck right? Maybe even more so for les anglais because they wont have to struggle with subtitles. Except its not and for a couple of reasons. The main one being Vince Vaughn who is no Patrick Huard.Vaughn assumes Huards role of David Wozniak alias Starbuck an aging slacker who discovers hes the father of 533 children all now in their 20s.His need for fast cash in his youth and his abundant supply of semen led David to repeatedly sell his manly fluid to a fertility clinic that was good at making babies but maybe not so good at managing secrets.Now 142 of the kids David sired want to know who their biological father is. The clinic is feeling legal heat. The kids havent picked a great time to go looking because dad hasnt exactly excelled at his own life quest. He drives a truck not well for his family business the Wozniak Meat Company. Perpetually late and unreliable hed be fired if not for the blood ties.Hes also perpetually broke a phrase that may soon also apply to his body since he owes a pile of dough to impatient mobsters.David gets no comfort from his erstwhile girlfriend Emma gamely played by Vancouvers Cobie Smulders a policewoman who has had it with Davids shiftless ways. Shes pregnant with his child the only one she knows about and shes preparing for life as a single mom because she doesnt believe in miracles. Its time for David to grow up or shut up but first he needs to satisfy his curiosity about the children he helped create. Using a pack of photos and bios obtained from the fertility clinic he begins stalking his grown offspring discovering that theyre experiencing both highs (new jobs fun gigs) and lows (addiction depression).The movie has been prettified and Disneyfied so that all the rough edges are sanded off. Jokes about masturbation and stud bulls a big part of Starbuck have been dialed way down. So has Vaughn. Hes usually a mile-a-minute talker but not here. This is both a good and bad thing. Its good to see him trying a different tempo but his more laconic demeanour robs the film of energy.Unlike Huard who will do anything for a laugh Vaughn seems reluctant to play David as the unshaven schlub he really is. Google the posters for Starbuck and Delivery Man;its like looking at Oscar and Felix from The Odd Couple. Compare too the scenes where Huard and Vaughn meet a severely disabled son in a nursing home played in both films by Sebastien Rene (the only onscreen Starbuck alumnus). In Starbuck Huard seems genuinely affected; in Delivery Man Vaughn seems like hes choosing the best camera angle for a feel-good moment. Its not all Vaughns fault that Delivery Man fails to fully deliver. His comic co-stars Bobby Moynihan and Chris Pratt give it their best but they cant beat the films other big impediment Its built around a funny story thats already been told not that not ago. Its hard to tell the same joke twice. Theres really just one too many offspring in this scenario and its Delivery Man.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

What if 18 years ago instead of rehearsing Swingers during the day and sampling Los Angeles starlets at night he had channeled his sexual energy into masturbating for cash at a sperm bank? He could have become Delivery Mans David Wozniak father of 533 children of whom 142 -- about a quarter -- want to meet the mystery donor who artificially inseminated their moms. A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - The mothers are invisible. Sure they bought the juice carried the fetuses and raised the infants to adulthood. But this comedy is strictly XY. Wozniak (Vaughn) against the advice of his lawyer (Chris Pratt) Brett decides to stalk the scions who have filed a lawsuit demanding the identity of the man behind his pseudonym Starbuck. Doing so he meets all sorts of kids -- lifeguards historical re-enactors buskers drunks -- each of whom seems motherless and alone in the world with a 6-foot-5 hole in their lives which only he can fill. Hes not just an onanistic slacker or a minimum-wage butcher facing a stack of parking tickets and gambling debts Hes their guardian angel.Hollywood hails men like David Wozniak as wastrel kings. Seth Rogen Jason Segel and Vaughn descend from an ignoble line that traces back to The Dude and Jeff Spicoli. But Delivery Man hails from Quebec where writer-director Ken Scott originally shot it with French-speaking comedian Patrick Huard which means America has successfully exported the slacker and now is getting him bounced back to us like crabs. Scott has even dumbed it down a notch. Merde.Film Details Delivery Man RatingPG-13 GenreComedy Running Time105 min. More Info Trailer Im being a little cruel to poor dumb Delivery Man. Its no better or worse than the rest of its kin -- unless youre a woman who believes in the existence of moms. But Im also not sure why Delivery Man exists except to appeal to a narrow Venn diagram of dude-bros who also change diapers. Upcoming Events Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On Abc Tickets Sat.

Sep. 13 600pm Many sociologists with fancier degrees than mine have speculated about a generational collapse in masculinity. They point to the growing segment of guys sleeping in their parents rec rooms while the percentage of college-educated males shrinks -- for the last several years six women have earned bachelors degrees for every four men.What will those sociologists make of this film which suggests that grown men should mimic their kids? When he discovers that one of his ilk is a pro basketball player David takes to the court like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. When another risks a job to follow his dreams you realize that David has no dreams of his own unless you count his ambition to grow weed. The flip side is that some of the kids reflect Davids worst traits Theyre egotistical needy manipulative. In one scene he frets over whether to check a heroin-addicted daughter into rehab. The doctor says shell relapse and die. The girl promises she wont. Its a tough moment not that youd know it from the sitcom music. The oboist seems to think overdoses are hilarious.This all takes place in a Disneyland version of Brooklyn which celebrates deer heads and Hall amp; Oates and flocks of rosy-cheeked children. (Er maybe its just everyday Brooklyn.) Davids brother has a newborn. Brett seems to have at least four. And they both seem to be miserable. Even David is expecting a baby of his own with his off-again on-again girlfriend (Cobie Smulders) to whom even the film cant seem to commit as she and the unborn child disappear for reels at a time.Scott doesnt dare ask the impossible asshole question Perhaps David is lucky that he got to skip out on diaper changing and orthodontist bills? The movie cant help but pit Davids friends actual fatherly grunt work against the pleasures of only having to deal with grown-up kids on whatever casual terms you want -- it seems far better to spend elective time with 142 cool hip good-looking young adults than to have to deal as Brett does with a houseful of screaming toddlers who wont go to sleep.As for those seven score and two good-looking young adults the films saccharine stretches include a bucolic family ""reunion"" -- really an introduction. I couldnt help but think about how confusing it would be for these lonely same-age half-siblings nearly all of whom look like Abercrombie amp; Fitch models to RSVP to an overnight mixer where every hot stranger is hands-off. But thats another movie one that wouldnt ever be remade for American audiences.Lets not blame Vaughn for this stale cupcake. Hes halfway through his Alec Baldwin-like transition from underbaked hunk to charismatic character actor. Hes barely trying to act here but we see him trying to learn how to operate his changing body especially a barrel chest thats straight out of a cartoon. Ive always liked him despite his frequently disastrous role choices -- hell he even braved Gus Van Sants shot-for-shot remake of Psycho.Vince lets paraphrase the one intelligent thing your character says in Delivery Man hopefully one of your last romantic comedies for a long long time. Quoth David ""Nobody but the father can decide if he is the father or not.""Replace ""father"" with ""actor.""

Comments click to enlarge Delivery Man Video Rated PG-13  105 minutes  2013 A lovable Brooklyn truck driver (Vince Vaughn) learns that his copious donations to a sperm bank decades earlier have produced a whopping 533 offspring a large portion of whom have banded together in a lawsuit to discover his identity. Remaking his earlier feature Starbuck (2011) writer-director Ken Scott follows through on this novel idea with some funny and unexpectedly melancholy scenes in which the hero spies on and gets to know his biological children. In fact the possibilities of the premise are so rich--what happens when these 20-somethings all start asking for money?--you wonder why Scott squanders so much screen time on more routine plot concerns (the hero owes money to a loan shark his girlfriend is pregnant and wants him to grow up his father is disappointed in him etc). This must be the sweetest comedy Vaughn has ever made and hes in top form throughout especially trading barbs with Chris Pratt as his friend and overmatched attorney. By J.R.

Area theaters. Theres always room for disaster when Hollywood reimagines a modest independent film. The cringe potential here only grew once it was announced that wed be seeing a big-budget version of Ken Scotts Canadian comedy ""Starbuck"" about a sperm donor who unwittingly becomes the father of hundreds of children. And yet the producers of ""Delivery Man"" made some smart decisions that have saved everyone a great deal of embarrassment. First and most surprisingly they took a risk and allowed the little-known Scott to remake his own movie. And second they cast Vince Vaughn in the lead. In place of the blundering Montreal slacker in ""Starbuck"" U.S. audiences get Vaughns affable Brooklyn underachiever Dave. He drives the truck for his familys meat-packing company but has no great ambitions much to the frustration of his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders). Dave is stunned when Emma announces her pregnancy but that news is nothing compared to the revelation that hits soon after. His long-forgotten donations to an artificial insemination clinic have resulted in 533 children -- now in their twenties -- who can technically call him Dad. And theyre trying to track him down. His lawyer (an amusing Chris Pratt) advises a low profile but Dave is intrigued. Without revealing his identity he gets to know the kids -- his kids -- and realizes he loves them all. But in hiding this huge secret from Emma he may be endangering his relationship with the 534th child hes about to have. Though its nearly identical in structure Scotts screenplay is oddly less fluid than the one he co-wrote for ""Starbuck."" Characters barely connect exposition is jammed awkwardly into conversation and major plot holes are regularly ignored. Chris Pratt (l.) and Vince Vaughn in Delivery Man (Jessica Miglio) Even so he keeps the action moving at a jaunty pace and has a genuine feel for the emotional undertow of Daves dilemma. Most important hes got Vaughn whose mix of silliness and sincerity is an ideal anchor for the broad premise. Vaughn is one of those actors who tends to autopilot his way through too many mediocre projects. When he goes all in though its impossible to resist his charm. Like Dave Vaughn could be a little more discerning when it comes to earning a living. But once in a while even a quick paycheck can develop into something more. On a mobile device?

Photo Jessica Miglio/AP MOVIE REVIEW Delivery Man Delivers the laughs. Running time 105 minutes. Rated PG-13 (sexuality brief violence). At the E-Walk the Kips Bay others. Basically a kinder gentler Vince Vaughn movie for people who dont like Vince Vaughn movies ""Delivery Man trades the abrasive comedians trademark snark for schmaltz -- an experiment that actually works better than youd guess. Vaughn plays a former sperm donor who learns hes sired 533 children in this close remake of the French-Canadian comedy ""Starbuck"" (which had a brief US release earlier this year) directed with a great deal more heart than usual for a Vaughn movie by the original writer-helmer Ken Scott. The setting has been moved from Montreal to Brooklyn where Vaughns David Wozniak is an irresponsible middle-aged boy who manages to hold onto his job as a deliveryman for a pork store only because its a family business. At first David is only mildly annoyed when he discovers that the very potent sperm he sold to raise money in the 1990s was overused -- and that 142 of his offspring are suing the fertility clinic to reveal his identity. But Davids curiosity is piqued when his cop girlfriend (the charming but under-used Cobie Smulders from ""Marvels the Avengers) announces shes pregnant with his child -- not that our hero bothers letting her know that its his 534th. When Davids bumbling attorney pal (a very funny Chris Pratt from ""Moneyball) obtains names and bios of the now-grown progeny who brought suit David cant resist checking out what sort of children hes already produced. David effectively stalks them while raising remarkably little suspicion -- except for one hyper-intellectual son (Adam Chanler-Berat) who blackmails David into letting him move into our heros apartment. The others he gets to know and sometimes help (without spilling his secret) include an aspiring actor (David Reynor) a lifeguard (Amos VanderPoel) and an African-American spa technician (Jessica Williams). More problematically for the movie David bonds with a heroin-addict daughter (Britt Robertson) whom he instantly cures -- and a severely disabled institutionalized son (Sebastian Rene the sole holdover from the original ""Starbuck cast). A subplot about Russian gangsters to whom David owes a gambling debt is nothing to write home about either. Vaughn is probably the Hollywood actor youd least expect to end up in a group hug or manning the grill at a mass outing  but hes surprisingly effective showing his softer side after a string of crass comedies like ""The Watch and ""The Internship. And noted Polish actor Andrzej Blumenfield is a standout as Davids immigrant dad in one of the years best-cast movies. ""Delivery Man which features some nice location shooting in New York sometimes goes overboard with the sentiment (""Youre all brothers and sisters And youve found each other David exhorts the 142 at one point). There are too many montages a Jay Leno montage (a cliche decades ago) and plot holes you could drive a truck through. But there are a lot of talented young faces and its heart is basically in the right place. You could do far worse for holiday entertainment.

For many people sausage is a guilty pleasure but they dont want to see how its made. The same goes for cheesy movies.If youre one of the few Americans who happened to see the French-Canadian comedy ""Starbuck"" you might have been charmed by the unfamiliar lead actor (Patrick Huard) and the premise of a Montreal sperm donor who is confronted by his hundreds of biological children. Now just a few months after that movies strategic Stateside release we get ""Delivery Man"" which is not only based on the same story it is directed by the same fellow and even features some of the same actors. But along with the language and location its got a different star Vince Vaughn. And like a sausage hes been squeezed into a tube.Ever since ""Swingers"" Vaughn has been improvising riffs on the same melody the blowhard bachelor who drags his buddies into the gutter. But Vaughn is 43 now married with two kids and people are starting to talk. One of them must have been the agent who handed him the warm-and-fuzzy script for ""Delivery Man."" Vaughn plays David Wozniak a chronically broke and bumbling New Yorker who delivers meat for his fathers butcher shop. After hes pummeled by loan sharks and dazed by the news that his fed-up girlfriend (Cobie Smulders) is pregnant David gets hit with a haymaker. A lawyer informs him that he is the biological father of 535 children spawned when he was a sperm donor 20 years earlier. Now more than a hundred of those children are suing the fertility clinic to learn his identity.Davids discombobulated friend (Chris Pratt) who is sort of a lawyer and sort of a dad warns him to dodge the whole mess. Instead David dips into the dossiers to learn the whereabouts of the now-grown kids. It turns out they are a genetic smorgasbord of actors athletes street musicians and even a few lost sheep with little in common except the need for a father figure. It requires a mild suspension of disbelief to accept that slacker David would suddenly intervene in so many lives pretending to be a good Samaritan. It requires a severe suspension of intelligence to accept that not one of these kids has a biological mom or adoptive dad to help with their problems and advise them about their improbable lawsuit.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Vince Vaughn has been leaning on the same shtick for so long--endlessly recycling the motormouthed dickishness he perfected in Old School--that its tempting to applaud the actor for any attempt at a departure. Tempting but impossible as doing so would require digesting the sitcom mush of Delivery Man and calling it an improvement. In this contrived fairy-tale farce Vaughn plays a well meaning but unreliable meat-truck driver who discovers that--thanks to regular visits to a sperm bank two decades earlier--hes fathered a whopping 533 children. Were this one of the stars bawdier vehicles that scenario would probably have birthed some off-color masturbation jokes or maybe a scene in which the hero mistakenly hits on (or is hit on by) one of his progeny. Instead the setup provides Vaughn never the most sweet natured of comic performers an unlikely opportunity to explore his sensitive side. The effort shows and not flatteringly More accustomed to slinging insults than beaming with paternal pride he makes sincerity look as uncomfortable as constipation. ""Feel-good"" does not come easily for the guy. Delivery Man may be a change of pace for Vaughn but its the exact opposite for its creator the Quebecois filmmaker Ken Scott. Belonging to the Funny Games school of carbon-copy remakes the film is an identical Hollywood retread of Scotts 2011 festival favorite Starbuck. Every scene every joke nearly every shot of the movie is straight out of the original. (Does the fact that Starbuck was no masterpiece itself make it more or less forgivable that Scott has basically traced over his own work?) The plot faithfully reproduced still finds David (Vaughn) ignoring the advice of his unlicensed lawyer (Chris Pratt scoring a few laughs) and tracking down the fruit of his labor all of whom are in their twenties and about a third of whom have entered a class-action lawsuit to discover the secret identity of their donor-dad. David whose on-again/off-again girlfriend (Cobie Smulders) is pregnant with his child wants to try his hand at parenting. And so he anonymously intervenes in the bastards lives--helping one kid score an acting role getting another into rehab and paying weekend visits to a son whos hospitalized and mentally disabled. The whole thing plays like some sort of Apatovian man-child version of Touched By An Angel. Given the outlandish premise--inspired by the true tale of a bull whose spunk spawned thousands of Holstein cattle--its probably foolish to expect any degree of plausibility from Delivery Man. But by the time David stumbles accidentally into a gathering of his brood and ends up struggling to explain how he knows so many of them its hard not to wonder why these young men and women havent figured out the identity of their mysterious benefactor. (Perhaps theyve inherited their fathers wits.) Devolving into a tiresome series of courtroom showdowns big speeches heartfelt confessions and declarations of affection--plus one groan-worthy group hug--Delivery Man suggests that there are worse things Vaughn could do than continue being Vince Vaughn. Like say turn into Robin Williams.

"Delivery Man 2.5 stars Article Comments () Things to do >> Movies >> Article Delivery Man 2.5 stars Chris Pratt (left) and Vince Vaughn in a scene from the film ""Delivery Man.""DreamWorks Pictures. SHARE URL EMAIL Tweet FONT A A A Photo URL To From Add a brief message (optional) Comments RELATED VIDEO ""Delivery Man"" trailer By Barbara VanDenburgh The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Nov 21 2013 823 AM It would appear some Hollywood studio exec saw French-Canadian director Ken Scotts 2011 film ""Starbuck"" and said ""Thats a nice movie you got there. Its a shame about all the subtitles."" Scott hopped back in the directors chair to remake the film -- this time in English and with the broad comic stylings of Vince Vaughn. The result is more or less an exact replica of the original same story same director practically the same script. Nevertheless something got lost in translation in the films passage through the Hollywood machine. With its edges sandpapered smooth the story about an affable loser discovering he has fathered 533 children is rendered ludicrously feel-good and nonsensical. Vaughn stars as David an irresponsible layabout and incompetent delivery-truck driver for his familys meat shop. Hes plagued by a bevy of problems the most pressing of which is a shadowy 80000 debt he owes (which is shockingly ill-explained given the amount of narrative space the subplot occupies). He cant seem to get it together from growing pot in his apartment to getting his delivery truck towed to failing to commit to his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) -- who he is shocked to discover is pregnant with his child. An unexpected pregnancy would floor just about any man. But Davids world is turned further upside down when a lawyer informs him that thanks to a clinic error all that sperm he donated under the pseudonym Starbuck back in his glory days has resulted in him being the biological father of 533 kids -- 142 of whom have filed a lawsuit to reveal the identity of the anonymous donor. He enlists the help of his lawyer friend Brett (played by the wholly likable Chris Pratt the source of the films every laugh) who provides David with a packet containing the profiles of his litigious wards. Because hes incapable of acting in his own self interest David starts going through the profiles and decides to tackle each child one by one swooping in like a schlubby guardian angel to dispense gifts and wisdom. Because its a film painted in the broadest possible strokes each kid functions as a hurdle in some sensitivity-training obstacle course. Theres a drug addict a gay kid an interracial kid and in a particularly emotionally manipulative coup de grace a special-needs kid in a wheelchair whos incapable of speech and living in a care facility. Theyre not people so much as convenient little life lessons to usher David into adulthood. There is some kernel of sweetness to all these vastly different people forming a meaningful bond over shared heritage a celebration of the beautiful variety of the human race but its too smothered in ""Kumbaya"" sentiment to savor. And what sweetness remains is hard to swallow thanks to Vaughn whose David is a manic man-child of wearying proportions coddled by the adults in his life into a cocoon of extended adolescence. All the while standing patiently by and none the wiser of his predicament is his long-suffering girlfriend who has all the charisma and self-reliance of a houseplant as she waits for her man to grow up. ""Delivery Man"" means well but its innocuous to the point of non-existence. In trying to please everyone the film runs the risk of pleasing no one.

Vince Vaughns latest offering fails to deliver on its premise. (Jessica Miglio) C Delivery Man Genre Comedy; Starring Chris Pratt Cobie Smulders Vince Vaughn; Director Ken Scott; Release Date Wide 11/22/2013; Runtime (in minutes) 105; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted December 4 2013 -- 1200 AM EST In Vince Vaughns latest lowbrow high-concept comedy the fast-talking firecracker from Swingers and Wedding Crashers looks exhausted. You get the sense from his red-rimmed eyes and lifeless patter that even hes tired of the junk hes been cranking out lately. An uninspired remake of the recent -- and far better -- Canadian import Starbuck Delivery Man is the story of a Brooklyn screwup named David Wozniak who years ago donated his sperm to a fertility clinic for money. It wasnt just a one-time lark. During a 33-month period in the 90s David was paid to ""wrestle the dragon"" 633 times (no wonder Vaughn looks so worn-out) resulting in 533 children. Now some of those kids are suing to find out the identity of their donor dad. Oh yeah and Davids in-the-dark girlfriend (How I Met Your Mothers Cobie Smulders) tells him that shes pregnant too. Honestly the setup sounds more promising than the hash that Vaughn and writer-director Ken Scott make of it. The lazy script jerks back and forth between masturbation-joke slapstick and gloppy sentimentality as David seeks out his offspring and tries to help them like a creepy guardian angel. The only saving grace is Chris Pratt as Vaughns deadpan best friend. Otherwise Delivery Man is a limp-noodle story about an unlikable guy who manages to grow up and become a marginally less unlikable guy.

"Delivery Man - Christy Lemire  Christy Lemire Home What the Flick? RogerEbert.com About Christy Christy Lemire Delivery Man Posted by Christy Lemire on November 20 2013 3 Comments DreamWorks Pictures Rated PG-13 for thematic elements sexual content some drug material brief violence and language. Running time 103 minutes. Two stars out of four. Vince Vaughn tries to escape his inherent Vince Vaughnishness -- with mixed results -- in ""Delivery Man."" Only the very slightest traces of his well-worn on-screen persona -- the fast-talking wise-cracking schemer he first played 17 years ago in ""Swingers"" -- are evident in this feel-good comedy about a middle-aged underachiever who discovers he has fathered hundreds of children through his anonymous sperm donations. Its as high-concept a premise as you can imagine one that would seem to find room for both playful laughs and reaffirming sentimentality. And indeed writer-director Ken Scott adapts ""Delivery Man"" from his own 2011 French-Canadian hit ""Starbuck"" without deviating vastly or losing much in the translation. Vaughn adeptly navigates the comedic part comfortably playing a lovable loser whos scrambling to keep all the plates spinning at once his finances his familys business his soon-to-be family with pregnant girlfriend Emma (an underused Cobie Smulders) and the family of hundreds hes just learned he has. His perpetual T-shirt-and-hoodie combo is such a reflection of his stunted inner self it may as well be his second skin. Its the earnestness that still fits him a bit awkwardly even if the softer approach is a welcome respite from the same-old shtick we saw earlier this year in ""The Internship."" At the films start Vaughns David Wozniak is quite literally a delivery man who drives around New York carrying meat to customers from his familys Brooklyn-based butcher shop. (Veteran Polish actor Andrzej Blumenfeld brings some grace and class to the film as the patriarch who built the store from nothing decades earlier.) When David himself was struggling for cash in the early 90s he became a sperm donor and a prolific one. It turns out that through an administrative error the clinic repeatedly gave his sperm to hopeful mothers making him the biological father of 533 children -- 142 of whom are suing to learn his identity. So David does what any lead character in a movie would do He seeks these people out one by one and performs good deeds in their lives against he advice of his longtime friend and lawyer Brett (Chris Pratt whose performance as a beaten-down father of four himself is probably the best part of the movie). He drops a tip for the guitar player busking in Central Park. He covers a bar shift for the aspiring actor who hopes to make an important audition. He gets his nails done from a manicurist at a local salon (a young woman whos half black in a clever bit of casting). The randomness of these undercover meetings is good for scattered laughs. But it also brings up an important question one of many that nagged at me as ""Delivery Man"" went along How is it possible that every single one of these kids who are all around 20 years old stayed in New York this entire time? Didnt any of them go off to college in a different state? Didnt any of them pack up for California with dreams of stardom? Just wondering. Sometimes though shit gets real -- as in the persistent and increasingly clingy presence of one of his sons an intense young man named Viggo (Adam Chanler-Berat). Theres also a fragile girl named Kristen (Britt Robertson) who nearly suffers a heroin overdose when David arrives pretending to be a pizza delivery man. The most shamelessly mawkish example of all though is the severely disabled Ryan (Sebastien Rene reprising his role from ""Starbuck"") a character who -- theoretically -- is meant to demonstrate the depth of Davids capacity for love but instead feels like a prop. At the same time David hopes that by improving these peoples lives hell learn to become a father to the baby hes expecting with his mistrustful girlfriend. Smulders plays a police officer which is an unexpected career choice but one that Scott never explores beyond placing her in a uniform and having her stand outside the station chatting with other cops. The character -- and the actress -- deserve more development than this. Ultimately though ""Delivery Man"" is more concerned with big heart-tugging moments than specific details that provide texture and ring true. Will all these people naturally feel angry and deceived when they learn that their newfound guardian angel is actually secretly their dad? Or will they embrace him in a massive group hug? The schlubby aw-shucks look on Vaughns face in the omnipresent ""Delivery Man"" ads tells you everything you need to know about the ooey-gooey direction in which the film is headed. Tweet Category Reviews Tags Chris Pratt Cobie Smulders comedy Vince Vaughn 3 Comments on ""Delivery Man"" November 20 2013  by  JozieLee     Saw the previews for this film and the subject made me laugh out loud. Your review intenifies my desire to see a sincere Vince Vaughn. I love him in almost anything he does . . . I especially enjoyed the quick trash talking character he played in Be Cool. A quieter gentler Vaughn? Gotta see this. OMG 20+years ago a dear friend graduated from college. A science major hed been approached about participating in sperm donation. He chatted very nonchalantly about donation. I was appalled and told him so that he could so callously consider scattering such a significant a part of himself to the wind. I asked what hed do when those children sought his identity. He doubted theyd care enough or that hed care enough to want to know them. It was just sperm; nothing significant. Boy was he wrong. Both his parents were medical professionals whod raised their children in a rather protected environment. I doubt he talked it over with them. He planned to further his career into medical research. To him at the time this would be his first step toward that goal. LOL. Hell see this movie advertised. I wonder if hell recognize a bit of himself in the storyline. Will he be appalled or amused or indifferent. I guess it depends on what choice he made back then. LOL Reply November 22 2013  by  Ted     Interesting review. One question So is it that its TOO sentimental or that the sentimentality is overdone? Reply March 28 2014  by  darren     wow I was just watching this and said to my wife how the disabled kid to me seemed like a prop and thought id google reviews to see who felt the same.

Mr. Emotional Immaturity suddenly finds out hes a father--142 times over to be precise--thanks to sperm he donated two decades previously. With a legion of artificially inseminated offspring suing to learn his identity and his fed-up girlfriend (Cobie Smulders) newly preggers David finds adult responsibilities looming everywhere he turns. So he does what every guy in his situation would do tracks down his children one at a time giving each of their lives a push (or sometimes a brusque shove) in the right direction. Does he learn something from each of them? You dont need 142 guesses to get that one right. Growing up isnt easy--for men or movie stars. Vaughn seems to be struggling to shed the amiable dude-bro mantle hes worn to diminishing returns since 2005s Wedding Crashers; even he seems tired of his shtick especially when he feigns not speaking English to avoid a difficult conversation. (No need to revise those famous-movie-quotes lists to make room for ""Yo no soy David Wozniak."") But if this remake of 2011s French-Canadian hit Starbuck feels as if its just going through the motions Vaughn himself radiates sincerity and good intention. The actor doesnt get it right this time but hes earned himself another chance.

Daily Edition Login to download Delivery Man Film Review 900 AM PST 11/12/2013 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME YOUTUBE PRINT COMMENTS Vince Vaughn gives his all as a prolific sperm donor in this fluffy innocuous comedy. TWITTER Vince Vaughn plays a chronic sperm donor whose progeny come back to haunt him in this American remake of 2011s ""Starbuck."" Warmth and fuzziness abounds in Delivery Man a feel-good yarn about the lovable-loser driver of a meat delivery truck whose old side gig as a fertility clinic donor has resulted in his being the dad of hundreds of biological children of whom 142 have filed a lawsuit to reveal his identity. An extremely faithful re-telling of Starbuck a popular 2011 French-Canadian comedy directed and co-written by Ken Scott (who duplicates his services here) the fictional film politely abstains from tapping the storylines ripe satirical potential in favor of a softer-around-the-edges approach. Thanks to some potent performances led by Vince Vaughn in a decidedly change-of-pace reflective turn this Disney release proves lightly entertaining in spite of its more heartfelt tendencies. It should perform modestly with the older-skewing audiences who wont be clamoring to catch Katniss and Peeta in The Hunger Games Catching Fire on their shared opening weekend. PHOTOS Hollywoods Most Notable Remakes Fonzy another Starbuck remake was released in France last month. Switching the setting from Quebec to New York for Delivery Man but leaving the bulk of the characters and scenes intact Scott and his co-writer Martin Petit adhere to the formulaic in their Everyman portrait of David Wozniak (Vaughn) the charming but immature deliveryman for the Wozniak amp; Sons family business. A career underachiever David is determined to finally clean up his act when his girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) tells him hes going to be a father. Turns out it wont be the first time -- a snafu at the now-shuttered fertility clinic where perpetually cash-strapped David would make regular deposits has resulted in 533 Wozniak descendants many of whom have sued to reveal the name of the man only identified as Starbuck. Refusing to heed the professional advice of his appointed attorney and best bud Brett (a very amusing pudgy Chris Pratt) whos barely coping raising four kids of his own David surreptitiously tracks down some of the plaintiffs in the class action paternity suit. His search results in anonymous interactions with a disparate group of late teens and 20-somethings -- including an aspiring actor a drug addict a YMCA lifeguard and a special needs young man confined to a wheelchair and unable to speak among others -- each of whom unwittingly help David along his path to becoming a better man. Its also a path that makes some ill-advised detours away from the agreeably buoyant comedic tone and toward soggier emotional terrain. The way one sequence in particular is staged -- involving an outing attended by dozens of his fresh-faced progeny -- youd swear David had sired an Up With People reunion. But its still nice to see Vaughn moving out of his fast-talking comfort zone in a role that requires him to be more quietly reactive; while Parks and Recreations Pratt comically raises the second-banana bar as a put-upon dad itching to get back into the courtroom. While Smulders unfortunately isnt given the same opportunity to show off her comedic chops regularly on display on How I Met Your Mother acclaimed Polish actor Andrzej Blumenfeld (in his American debut) makes a more empathetic impression as the warm Wozniak family patriarch.

In the 17 years since ""Swingers"" Vince Vaughn has cultivated the comedic persona of an obnoxious and insensitive boor so it may come as a surprise to learn that ""Delivery Man"" reveals a softer side entirely. As David Wozniak the worlds most fertile sperm donor the star plays someone whos overwhelmed as opposed to merely overwhelming. Its a welcome change though a significant marketing challenge as well considering DreamWorks has almost no way of letting audiences know that ""Delivery Man"" is virtually nothing like a Vince Vaughn movie but rather a heartfelt celebration of the act of parenthood presented under radically exaggerated circumstances.This story first appeared in the November 19 2013 issue of Variety. Subscribe today.See more. Such sincerity comes easy for Canadian writer-director Ken Scott whos already told this story once before in the charming French-language hit ""Starbuck."" Now working in Hollywood he demonstrates the good sense not to mess with success engineering what amounts to a scene-for-scene remake of that earlier feel-good outing -- with the notable addition of Chris Pratt in his funniest supporting performance yet. Transplanted from Montreal to Manhattan for the benefit of this new version Wozniak drives a deli-meat truck but even that task proves too much responsibility for his stunted abilities. Vaughns character may not be the sharpest blade in the family butchery but he has a good soul which comes through the instant he receives news that would send any normal man into panic mode. Nearly 20 years earlier he donated dozens of times to a fertility clinic which through an administrative fluke used his sperm to foster 533 children 142 of whom are demanding to know the identity of their biological father. More shocking for Wozniak is the revelation that his policewoman g.f. (Cobie Smulders) is pregnant though neither revelation is particularly easy to process for a man who grows marijuana in his apartment and has more parking tickets than dollars to his name. Presented with a packet of information about his children Wozniak draws one page at random and decides to pay the kid a visit eavesdropping on a professional basketball game where his son scores the winning shot. For a split second the film allows audiences to think that perhaps this sub-average shlub could be responsible for fathering 533 exceptional offspring a mix of athletes stars and world leaders. Thats the beauty of Scotts script which supplies precisely the emotional uplift moviegoers want while still managing to surprise at every turn. The circumstances may be contrived but the characters feel refreshingly genuine. Its a testament to the directors talent that the chemistry works equally well with two entirely different ensembles while casting director Jeanne McCarthy has uncovered such talented young thesps as Britt Robertson and Jack Reynor for the English-language version. ""Delivery Man"" skips over all the diaper changes and sleepless nights and gets to the essence of parenthood when fathers must learn to put aside their preconceived expectations and accept their children for who they are. Life is well under way for most of them when Wozniak enters into the picture and the movie celebrates the diversity of possibility presenting him with offspring of all colors and personalities. The film observes tenderly as he goes to visit one son in a home for the severely disabled (Sebastien Rene represents the pics the lone case of repeat casting) and provides an unexpected chuckle when he discovers that another is gay. That scene leads to the films biggest surprise -- a perfectly conceived moment set at a conference that steers what could have settled for farce into far deeper territory. Where so many laffers rush to dismiss raw emotion with an ironic wink Scott isnt afraid to get sentimental. In fact he embraces the possibility serving up a film that overflows with touching moments between a father and the children he never knew. Each and every subplot either supplies its own life lesson or serves to reinforce the pics upbeat view of fatherhood from the sacrifices Wozniaks immigrant dad (gifted Polish actor Andrzej Blumenfeld who has worked with such greats as Polanski and Kieslowski) made for his family to the way his kid brother (Bobby Moynihan) boasts about his newborns bowel movements. None can compete with Pratt however who plays Wozniaks best friend a buffoon of a lawyer who can barely manage his four young kids -- tiny terrors who he recklessly insists ""know theyre too old to get an abortion."" It would be no stretch at all to interpret ""Delivery Man"" as a pro-life movie illustrating as it does the miraculous range of individual personalities that can result from the same set of paternal genes each one special in its own way. But Scotts warm-hearted humanism extends further than family as if to remind that we are all brothers and sisters with more in common than could possibly separate us. Even if your soul cant stand the thought of Vince Vaughn at the center of a 143-person group hug theres no denying this marks a turning point for the star. With Scotts help he has delivered a rare and special package indeed. Film Review Delivery ManReviewed at Walt Disney Studios Burbank Calif. Oct. 29 2013. MPAA Rating PG-13. Running time 105 MIN.

He hasnt been physically absent from the movies by any means but the fast-talking hustler of ""Swingers"" has become over the years a lazy and uninspired leading man emptily vamping his way through forgettable vehicles like ""The Watch"" and ""The Internship"" and ""The Dilemma"" and ""Four Christmases"" and ""Fred Claus"" to name just a few. Granted Vaughn probably couldnt single-handedly rescue his latest ""Delivery Man"" but hes certainly not helping. A remake of the Canadian comedy ""Starbuck"" (released in the U.S. earlier this year) ""Delivery Man"" offers comedy and sentimentality in equal doses and unfortunately equal efficacy -- the jokes the characters and the situations arent very funny and the would-be heart-tuggery is mostly embarrassing. See video Vince Vaughns Sperm Can Really Swim in Delivery Man Trailer Vaughn stars as David Wozniak a neer-do-well manchild whos unreliable and constantly in trouble; hes currently deeply in debt to some thugs because of a bad investment and his wages as a delivery-truck driver for his fathers butcher shop isnt helping him make ends meet. Davids cop girlfriend Emma (Cobie Smulders) announces shes pregnant but that she doesnt want David involved until he can get his act together. Soon thereafter David learns that Emma isnt the first woman to carry his child; back in the 1990s he earned money as a frequent sperm donor and it turns out that he has biologically fathered nearly 600 children more than 100 of whom are suing the fertility clinic to learn Davids identity. Davids best pal less-than-competent lawyer Brett (Chris Pratt) urges David to keep his paternity secret -- he used the code name ""Starbuck"" when making donations -- but when David gets his hands on letters from his children he cant resist the urge to start snooping. Also read James Marsden Nick Frost in Negotiations to Join Vince Vaughn in Business Trip (Exclusive) Before long David is peeking in on the lives of several of his kids taking over a sons barista shift so he can make an audition watching to make sure a daughter doesnt backslide into heroin addiction cheering various offspring on at their jobs as lifeguards and historical reenactors. Doing good deeds for these young adults he thinks will prove to Emma that hes got the right stuff for fatherhood. This synopsis probably makes ""Delivery Man"" sound more fun than it is -- the movie lacks wit and energy and its attempts to be quippy fall flat defying the comic talents of Pratt and Smulders and Bobby Moynihan (who plays one of Davids more settled brothers). Also read Dave Franco Joins Vince Vaughn in Comedy Business Trip The films portrayal of Davids involvement with his spawn starts out creepy -- theres something weirdly stalker-ish about the way he suddenly insinuates himself into the lives of these people who dont know who he is -- before becoming insulting and offensive. David discovers that he has an institutionalized son who uses a wheelchair and is unable to communicate. ""Delivery Man"" gleefully turns this character into a trophy for Davids decency hoping to score points by dragging him out as a magical prop and its utterly condescending. Writer-director Ken Scott who also made the original film writes himself in circles to keep the whole plot deception going to the point where it seems Davids only reason to remain anonymous is that now that news of the lawsuit has hit the media theres public ridicule of ""Starbuck"" as a chronic masturbator. And the whole owing-money-to-mobsters subplot which only rarely even comes up gets settled so lickety-split you might miss the resolution during a popcorn run. Corn is all youre getting from ""Delivery Man"" unfortunately and its a particularly stale batch. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
