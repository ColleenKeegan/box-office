"Appaloosa (R)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies Appaloosa (R)  Lawmen form bond in Wild West. Ed Harris Renee ZellwegerViggo Mortesen and Jeremy Irons in New Line Cinemas Western ""Appaloosa."" The film is distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle The Miami Herald Essentially a buddy movie in which the cops tote shotguns and travel on four legs instead of four wheels Appaloosa takes the traditional notion of a lone lawman fighting injustice and turns it successfully on its head. Based on a spritely western by detective novelist Robert B. Parker creator of the Spenser series the film follows the exploits of Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) gunslinging partners in a peacekeeping business who are hired by town officials to keep villains in check. But when the partners take on a job in Appaloosa a ragtag settlement in the New Mexico territory the job tests not only their friendship but also their mettle. Rogue rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons not entirely adept at swallowing that plummy accent) has shot up an Appaloosa marshal and the city elders want him stopped. Cole and Hitch eventually capture him but a distraction in the form of the widowed piano player Mrs. French (Renee Zellweger) flits into town and pretty soon all sorts of chaos follows. The film doesnt carry the narrative or philosophical weight of last years excellent remake of 310 to Yuma but it turns out to be a satisfying if occasionally wandering adventure. The screenplay lifts lines wholesale from Parkers pithy dialogue and director Harris who also directed and starred in 2000s biopic Pollack brings a dusty realism to the setting. Alternately tough and amusing hes the perfect actor to play this gruff but secretly vulnerable character who transforms engagingly from man-of-few-words to nervous suitor whenever Mrs. French arrives on the scene. Sadly the audience will feel a lot less affection for the flighty widow. Zellweger seems miscast too modern for the 1882 setting and supremely unworthy of the attention lavished on her although Cole points out that he like most of the men of Appaloosa are accustomed to far less genteel womenfolk. Shes very clean he tells Hitch and she chews her food nice. Such is romance before the advent of indoor plumbing. The real love story here though -- no Brokeback jokes please -- is between Cole and the laconic West Point-educated Hitch whose genuine affection for the older man turns out to be the films heart. Watching him casually supply words while Cole struggles for them is a treat -- the two actors play off each other with a delightful understated comic timing. Theirs is a partnership for the ages and the crafty creators of Appaloosa make great use of it.

""Appaloosa"" is a decent Western made in an era when a Western has to be pretty darn good to rope people into a theater to see it. With genial performances from Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen as good guys and a snakey Jeremy Irons as the chief baddie Harris first directorial outing since his impressive and entirely different ""Pollock"" biopic bears echoes of many genre predecessors especially Howard Hawks ""Rio Bravo"" -- but echoes they remain. With a sometimes goofy sense of humor as its main distinguishing mark this New Line title fed into the Warner Bros. distribution mill looks poised for modest fall biz. Having nothing to do with a horse or Sidney J. Furies 1966 Universal release ""The Appaloosa"" starring Marlon Brando this very faithful adaptation of Robert B. Parkers novel instead focuses on two dapper roving lawmen -- they probably wouldnt like being called mercenaries -- who turn up in the eponymous New Mexico town after the local marshal and two of his men are gunned down by Irons Randall Bragg a gang leader bent on controlling a good deal of New Mexico territory. Script by Robert Knott and Harris slips into semi-comic mode almost at once as Virgil Cole (Harris) clad in a well-tailored black outfit and more taciturn right-hand man Everett Hitch (Mortensen) lay out their terms to local civic leaders (led by Timothy Spall trying to maintain English propriety in an unlikely setting) for restoring order What they say goes. The men prove their worth by taking down three of Braggs boys who come to test them after which Bragg himself turns up for a chat with Virgil. ""Maybe you arent good enough"" Bragg threatens with a John Huston-like growl in a classic Hawksian line and you know theres a showdown waiting at the end of the road. But there are many high noons in between. Newly arrived widow Allison French (Renee Zellweger) presents herself as a proper lady and intrigues Virgil as such but subsequently provides plenty of reasons to believe she is anything but. Harris as actor and director milks for all its worth Virgils surprise at his sudden bent for domesticity with this piano-playing rose given that his previous history with women has been limited to ""whores and squaws."" For his part Everett observes his pals courtship with incredulous bemusement although he soon gets an insight into Allisons true character hes not about to share with his friend. When one of Braggs gang slips into town to say hell testify in court against his boss Virgil and Everett manage to arrest the slippery villain. Its here that the story hews closely to ""Rio Bravo"" as the two lawmen stand vigilant guard at their small jail until a judge can arrive to try their prisoner knowing that at some point the captives men will try to spring him and kill the witness in the bargain. But by the midway point there are still plenty of surprises and the track takes many turns before anyone can get a good nights sleep. Dialogue much of it lifted straight from Parkers novel proves mostly engaging especially as it relates to Virgils dedication to improving his vocabulary. He tries to drop impressive polysyllabic words into his speech whenever he thinks of them; some attempts are more successful than others but are invariably comic. When the well-spoken Bragg inhabits the cell right next to his desk hes put at a distinct linguistic disadvantage. Pics most disappointing aspect stems from the visuals. Direction especially in the interiors consists of standard master shots and cut-ins while outdoors stuff mostly shot in New Mexico looks oddly thin and washed-out. Compositions lack boldness and the action could have generated more visceral excitement. Interest is mainly sustained by the plot and repartee between Harris and Mortensen with Irons reliably injecting menace whenever hes on. Gradual revelation of Allisons true nature offers mild surprise. But given that Virgil credits his long survival in his risky line of work to a reserve born of his belief that ""feelings get you killed"" one wonders exactly what it is about her that makes him drop his heart-of-stone resolve for this particular woman; Zellweger doesnt exactly clarify the matter.

Photo Matt Lankes MATT LANKES/The Kobal Collectio Movie review Appaloosa 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Appaloosa Western. Starring Ed Harris Viggo Mortensen Jeremy Irons and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Ed Harris. (Rated R. 114 minutes. At Bay Area theaters. Its easy to imagine Ed Harris sitting in a bar during the ""National Treasure Book of Secrets"" shoot after one too many drinks griping that they dont make movies the way they used to when Paul Newman was a star. ""Appaloosa"" is so close in tone to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" that it couldnt be an accident. But it also goes its own way enough so that it doesnt seem like a cheap knockoff. Harris co-wrote directed and stars in the film which is filled with humor action and clever turns. Based on a novel by ""Spenser"" crime novelist Robert B. Parker its not a particularly challenging movie featuring two tough-guy lawmen an evil rancher a scared township and a comely and refined lady who breezes into town on a steam train. The plot has all the tough talk double crosses and showdowns that one would expect from the genre. In terms of tone it falls somewhere between ""Silverado"" and the original ""310 to Yuma."" Fans of last years artsy and cerebral Jesse James movie will consider this a setback for the genre. But it offers two things that you dont see in most Westerns exploration of the relationship between the hero and his sidekick and a very smart script that never seems secondary to the action. Add a discussion about Partridge Family lunch boxes and this could have been written by Quentin Tarantino. Harris is Virgil Cole a town marshal for hire whose gunplay is surpassed only by his ability to come up with good one-liners in tense situations. ""Put your little contraption away"" he says upon discovering two ranch hands urinating in the town saloon. ""I want to walk you down to the jailhouse and I dont want to spook the horses."" Cole has a little bit of Clint Eastwood in him so its good his partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) is a little more tempered although no less lethal. Its a shortcoming of the movie that rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) and his oafish mob never seem like much of a match for our heroes. Other characters come and go with motivations that always seem to be shifting including Renee Zellweger as a saucy love interest and Lance Henriksen as a gun for hire. Only Cole and Hitch stay the same guided by their cruel but consistent Old West code. Zellweger who has never looked more like Edith from ""All in the Family"" doesnt quite sell her complicated character. But Mortensen looking as malnourished as Dennis Quaids Doc Holliday in ""Wyatt Earp"" is all brooding feral charm and steals the movie from the protagonist. Harris an able if unimaginative filmmaker who makes this his second directing effort after ""Pollock"" is smart enough to get out of the way. If Mortensen can pull off the survivalist father in the post-apocalyptic drama ""The Road"" (another role that requires weight loss and facial hair) this could be an even better year for the actor than 2007. The ending is a bit of a letdown and there are other small distractions such as the way the buildings look a bit too structurally sound. ""Appaloosa"" also lacks the feeling that diseases are being spread in every corner of town which was never a problem while watching ""Deadwood."" Most of the time though the movie is appropriately gritty and plenty engaging. We can forgive Harris slumming performances in movies such as ""Stepmom"" and ""Radio"" if it means well get a movie like this every few years. -- Advisory This film contains violence and strong language.

"Appaloosa | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; appaloosa ) Appaloosa (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli One of the most evident signs of the shift in movie-goers tastes over the years has been the decline of the Western. Once among the most popular of film genres it now ranks near the bottom. If theres a benefit to this downturn its that modern Westerns rarely go into production unless they possess a complex or challenging quality. In many ways Ed Harris Appaloosa is one of the most traditional examples we have seen since the genre underwent a shift during the early 1990s with Oscar wins by Dances with Wolves and Unforgiven. It is not as compelling as three recent Westerns a The Proposition Open Range and 310 to Yuma - but theres enough quality material to be found bookended between the opening and closing credits to make this compulsory viewing for those who retain a fondness for what the Western can bring to the screen. Appaloosa is more of a character-based Western than a shoot-em-up although thats not to say there arent gunfights. Instead the films action-based set pieces are relegated to short staccato bursts widely separated by lengthy segments that are heavy on dialogue and dramatic interaction. One of the most important aspect of any Western - the ability of the filmmakers to re-create a world that has been blown away by modernism like a tumbleweed by a high wind - has not proven to be an insurmountable obstacle to Harris. His vision of 1882 New Mexico is rich in period detail and atmosphere. Appaloosa does not feel like a town that has sprung up on a studio backlot (as was the case with many 50s and 60s Westerns). Instead its as if the cast and crew have stepped into a time machine to get their shots. Appaloosa like many Old West towns is as light on law and order as it is on population. This makes it ripe for abuse by a rich powerful outlaw like Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) whose ""boys"" are allowed to drink the whiskey use the whores and take the livestock without consideration of recompense. Eventually the town leaders become so fed-up with Bragg that they call in renowned gunman Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) to be their marshal. Cole is accompanied by Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) his constant companion for many years. Cole drives a hard bargain but the men who run Appaloosa are eager to rid themselves of Bragg and his gang. The standoff begins with three of Braggs men dead followed by a cat-and-mouse game between the lawman and the gangster that leads to but does not culminate in Bragg being arrested and spirited away from his ranch in the middle of the night. Meanwhile theres a new woman in town. Allie French (RenA(c)e Zellweger) who declares herself to be widowed and not a whore has her eye on Virgil but that doesnt stop her from showing interest in Everett. In fact she seems more attracted to power than men as becomes apparent whenever she comes in contact with a new top dog. The motivations of the characters are never straightforward and no one in Appaloosa fits neatly into a clean stereotype. Virgil is a straight-shooter but despite his ability with a gun hes not the most intelligent marshal in the Old West and hes not the most confident of men when away from his job. He also has a strict code about not breaking the law and will not circumvent it. Everett has his own set of rules but they arent as rigid. Virgil might only view Everett as a companion; Everett considers the older man more than that - perhaps a mentor or even a friend. Allie isnt a traditional damsel in distress. One gets the opinion that regardless of the situation shell land on her feet. With her there are no double-standards and Virgil understands what she represents when he promises to be there for her for as long as she needs him. The film is well cast with all of the actors being chosen for their ability to fit into the period costumes and settings without seeming out of place. One has no difficulty accepting Harris as the square-jawed marshal. Mortensen is his usual low-key self providing an individual who is at once both heroic and humble. Zellweger impresses not only because shes feisty but because the actress doesnt mind getting a little dirty (literally). In the dusty town of Appaloosa she doesnt always look like shes fresh from a bath and a visit to a hairdresser. Jeremy Irons recalls Richard Harris from Unforgiven albeit without the accent. Ariadna Gil has a nice secondary role as a barmaid who hooks up with Everett; the character is brimming with unrealized potential but Gil brings her to our attention. Westerns often take themselves seriously and while Appaloosa is no Blazing Saddles theres a refreshing vein of understated humor running throughout the production. Its neither forced nor unnatural and it keeps things from becoming too somber even when the bullets start flying. There are some pacing problems associated with the structure. One could argue that the movies climax comes too early and the last half hour requires a little too much retrenching and meandering before the conclusion is reached. I found Appaloosa to be gripping and dramatically satisfying for its first 90 minutes but I wasnt as pleased with the final act which feels more tacked-on than organic. Flaws aside Appaloosa remains a valid reason to be thankful that while Westerns may no longer be as victorious at the box office as their gunslinger protagonists they are not dead.

Photo Lorey Sebastian Warner Bros. Appaloosa 1 / 1 Back to Gallery THE familiar trappings of Western movies are also their greatest pleasures boots crunching on rubble a bell tolling before a duel a wide-brimmed hat throwing shadows on a hard mans face. Small details all of them but they echo over decades of filmmaking -- dusty windswept cowpoke stories about men with guns who make their own law or die trying. From its first mournful brass theme Ed Harriss Appaloosa nails the look and feel of a classic Western. This is an old-style laconically macho six-shooting horse opera made with an obvious and unapologetic love of the genre. Theres nothing neo about it; nothing ironic; nothing deconstructionist or precious. It doesnt unpack the genres psychological laundry (like Unforgiven) or ravish it with 21st-century graphic violence (like 310 to Yuma). It just hits every conceivable button that a Western can hit putting two tough-minded gunmen in a lonely outpost terrorized by a pack of lawless killers -- then tossing in a shapely widow sniveling town officials a railroad hold-up a bit of Camptown Races at the pye-an-uh and lots of tough epigrammatic dialogue spat out like hunks of chaw. It even has Indians for crying out loud. For a while the whole thing comes across as so much cornpone. But then the indefinable magic of genre storytelling takes hold and all those oat-eating cliches start adding up to a terse and enjoyable story. Some credit goes to Harris pithy screenplay (co-written with Robert Knott from a Robert B. Parker novel) some to his manful direction -- his first effort in that capacity since 2000s fascinating Pollock. But most of it goes to his chemistry with Viggo Mortensen who plays the younger shrewder barely more talkative half of a taciturn gun-fighting duo who ride into a lonesome town called Appaloosa. Its 1882 in the New Mexico Territory. An uppity thug named Bragg (Jeremy Irons) has just killed the town marshal and two deputies. He and his gang of hairy malefactors now have the run of the place. Desperate for help officials hire Virgil Cole (Harris) and Everett Hitch (Mortensen) to take over the marshals duties and rule with an iron hand. Their first task ""Button up the town tighter than a nuns corset"" Everett says. How so? ""Whatever Mr. Cole says is law."" Right away Virgil and Everett catch a couple of Braggs boys peeing wantonly in a saloon then kill em when they resist arrest. Shortly thereafter the fetching Mrs. Allison French (Renee Zellweger) arrives in town and with her trouble. To say she softens the leathery old Virgil -- or awakens in him something that passes for love -- misses the point of the films sinewy masculine drama which cares about the silk-ruffled Allie only so far as she throws these two rugged gunslingers off their game. Theirs is the (entirely platonic) tale of love and sacrifice that drives the story. As Allie Zellweger is meant to be an irritant. And so she is. I have to hand it to her between this and her Constance Bennett screwballing in Leatherheads she has now cornered the market on cloying roles in genre throwbacks. Her part like Timothy Spalls as an officious priss in a bowler is more of a plot device than a character. Irons does better as the underwritten Bragg mincing around in tidy waistcoats. But Mortensen and Harris are the main attraction in Appaloosa and they wear their characters like a couple of low-slung gats. Mortensen pointy of beard and wiry of profile looks like a sepia image come to life. As the clean-shaven Virgil Harris (who also sings in the credits) is harder to get a bead on -- but Mortensens steady blue eyes take him in and tell us everything. One rough man understands the other and his job In a Western thats enough. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals NFL Caps at Lids for 10 + free shipping w/ 50 Mini Bluetooth 4.0 In-Ear Headset for 4 + free shipping Banana Republic Final Cut Sale Up to 75% off + free shipping...

Along with deputy Everett Hitch he arrives in Appaloosa N.M in the 1880s. The towns anxious aldermen require the duos gunslinging services to bring brutally law-resistent rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) to justice for a killing. Ed Harris is Cole. The equally square-jawed Viggo Mortensen is Hitch. Theyve traveled the territories for 12 years and as Hitch says by way of introduction ""Id no reason to doubt that wed be doing just that for the foreseeable future. But life has a way of making the foreseeable that which never happens. . . ."" Yup. Throw a filly into the mix and things are bound to get complicated. Though were pleased to report not in the ways youd necessarily expect. Renee Zellweger purses her lips a little too much when her character Allie sashays into town and turns Coles head. She is not a whore a common occupation. Nor is she a virgin. And this not-quite-black-or- white quality to life in general gives ""Appaloosa"" gritty appeal. Harris directs with a steady hand and sharp eye for the best in his fellow actors. Still the surest chemistry and the movies leisurely pleasures come from Cole and Hitchs long association and the laconic joy Mortensen and Harris take in the deep wells and amusing dry spells of their cowboy conversation. Directed by Ed Harris; written by Harris and Robert Knott; from the book by Robert B. Parker; photography by Dean Semler; starring Ed Harris Viggo Mortensen Renee Zellweger Jeremy Irons.

Comments Appaloosa Recommended Ed Harriss performance as Jackson Pollock was probably the best thing about his directorial debut Pollock (2000) and its largely the performances that linger in his second feature (2008) a solidly constructed traditional western that he and Robert Knott adapted from a Robert Parker novella. Harris and Viggo Mortensen star as hired guns Jeremy Irons is the ruthless rancher theyre tangling with and Renee Zellweger is a mannerist standout as the promiscuous and unpredictable widow who wins Harriss heart. This isnt a visionary western like The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada (2005) but in its own quiet way it delivers the goods. R 114 min.

"Appaloosa covers western territory - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Appaloosa covers western territory By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / October 3 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Appaloosa"" is a warmly made slightly offbeat movie about friendly devotion. It also happens to be a western and every man in it is grizzled or wizened or both. They could all be in contention for a Civil War postage stamp. The exception is Virgil Cole the marshal-for-hire played by Ed Harris who co-wrote and directed ""Appaloosa."" Virgil has almost no hair. His beady eyes smolder beneath a hat whose brim could double as one of Saturns rings.Virgil is lonely. For years he and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) have been dropping into places enforcing the law and leaving. The individual roots they put down keep getting ripped up for an itinerant life in each others company. What are these two best friends? Life partners? Brothers? Some combination of all three. Then a widow named Allison French (Renee Zellweger) arrives in the New Mexico town theyre protecting from a corrupt rancher Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons). This woman allows Virgil and Everett to consider that each man is not enough for the other. Allison and Virgil move quickly toward settling down together but hes never known domesticity. Hes married to work and to some extent to Everett.Harris and actor Robert Knott adapted ""Appaloosa"" from a Robert B. Parker novel and theyve held onto the dialogue which conjures images of tumbleweed blowing through a Dashiell Hammett book. One of the townsmen who hire Virgil and Everett describes Bragg and his mens freeloading ""They been living off us like coyotes living off a dead buffalos carcass.""In so many ways the film is a slim traditional western. Even if Virgils hat is black the law is good and Bragg is not. In the middle of the picture Virgil and Everett escort Bragg out of town to be hung for murder. The genre does undergo the occasional sexual adjustment particularly in matters involving Allison who is very much the prudent wifely woman she appears to be. But her primness isnt the whole story. She likes a mans attention regardless of whose it is.""Appaloosa"" is a traditional western in that it tolerates certain character flaws. Vicious killing is a crime; promiscuity is not. And so Harris affectionately mines the characters relationships for comedy. Virgils enumeration of Allisons finer points to Everett is hilariously basic. ""Chews her food good"" is one dubious endorsement. Even Bragg is a source of amusement although with Irons in the part how could he be otherwise? Irons sounds as if hes talking with marbles in his mouth again but he pumps the performance with enough dastardly charm and exasperation that even Virgil and Everett seem to be having second thoughts about supervising his death march.Zellweger manages to overcome costumes that look as if theyre wearing her. All she has to do is smush up her face and people forgive her everything. In silence Mortensen has become a truly soulful actor. Standing back and watching a scene unfold around him can be a far more entertaining experience than having him explain what he thinks or how he feels. In other words the western suits him although not quite as well as it does Harris who as an actor is on his best behavior here. He lets his body language do all the talking. More than once we get a nifty shot of the actor in stern repose. His feet are up a rifle rests in his lap his eyes have drifted off yonder. Its a window into a character that also doubles as a handsome self-portrait. Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. For more on movies go to www.boston.com/ae/movienation.

The time 1882. The Man Virgil Cole hired gun.Ed Harris directs himself as Virgil in Appaloosa a western quarried from the same glowing block of sandstone as its filmmaker/star. Viggo Mortensen offers solid support as Virgils lieutenant Everett Hitch who sees much says little and shoots straight - both with guns and words. The men are devoted to each other and to the task of protecting the townspeople of Appaloosa from a terrorizing rancher named Bragg (Jeremy Irons). But their bond is tested by the arrival of Mrs. French (RenA(c)e Zellweger) a citified widow of unknown origin who snares Virgil in the crook of her dimple. As adapted by Harris and Robert Knott from the novel by Robert Parker Appaloosa is an archetypal western with touches of the modern buddy comedy. Though it falls short of these classics it is a little bit Destry Rides Again and a little bit more Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. To his films peril Harris who made his directorial debut with Pollock is more attentive to his actors than to his tempo. Although beautifully shot by cinematographer Dean Semler with every sequence so lovingly framed and composed that it would make a fantastic still the unhurried film proceeds at the pace of Virgils stiff-legged stride. Sometimes a western just needs to gallop. Harris plays Virgil as a professional prone to stutters of the mouth and flutters of the heart. Inevitably it is Everett who helps him complete his sentences and his comprehension of how the world works. On paper Zellwegers Allie French is a fascinating creature - flirty and romantic yet realistic. But on screen the woman who comes between the two friends - and also between them and their job - is a flibbertigibbet whose weathervane personality must be patiently explained by Everett to Virgil. Would but her character was less written and more realized. The supporting players are uniformly strong particularly Timothy Spall as the rabbity townie who hires Virgil and Irons as the tyrannical rancher. (Like Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood Irons does an uncanny vocal impersonation of John Huston.) First and last Appaloosa is the slow-but-sure story of the friendship between Virgil and Everett one a man of action surprised by emotion the other a man of emotion surprised by action. Their friendship is one that thrives in long passages of silence short bursts of violence and a most considered act of empathy.

The film which Ed Harris co-wrote directs and stars in is old-school from its 10-gallon hat to its spurs - and all the better for it. Its as if Harris defied convention by being conventional. Based on the novel by Robert Parker Appaloosa is perfectly content to let the good guys be good the bad guys be bad and leave it at that. Harris plays Virgil Cole - even the name screams movie-star cowboy. Hes a legendary hired gun a straight shooter in just about every sense possible. His partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) is perhaps equally adept at gunplay. But as Cole notes he suffers from a potentially debilitating malady He has feelings. Thats not a problem for Cole. At least not until Allison French (Rene Zellweger) pulls into town. Distractions of that sort - the complicated Allison is nothing if not a distraction - might not be such a serious matter in some cases. But things in Appaloosa have become serious indeed. Thats because Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) and his gang have basically taken over Appaloosa killing the sheriff and scaring the town fathers enough that they give Cole unlimited authority to regain control. Its power that Cole does not hesitate to exercise whether with his warnings or if need be his gun. That a showdown between Cole and Bragg is looming is of course no surprise. But the path to it is somewhat unexpected and complicated considerably by Allison which prevents the film from falling into a cookie-cutter trap. Allisons presence ensures that Cole will have to make uncomfortable decisions; Coles demeanor and sense of honor ensure that he will do what he thinks is right at the expense of everything else. Almost no traditional facet of the Western is left unexplored. A vintage courtroom scene with a crusty old hanging judge (Bob Harris) a daring escape trouble with Native Americans and a double-cross or two all make their way into the story. As does of course a shootout. (More than one actually.) The film looks great with lots of wide-open spaces surrounding a dusty little town. And although theres plenty of violence Harris wisely remembers that the actual business of a shootout doesnt take long (especially when as he notes to Hitch everyone can shoot). Thus much of the film takes place between duels and such. What keeps that from becoming a boring meditation on watching tumbleweeds tumble by is the relationship between Cole and Hitch who often muse about their lives and where theyre leading and more specifically the performances by Harris and Mortensen. Cole is cold distant - cant allow feelings to get in the way remember - and utterly devoted to the task at hand which is settling down Appaloosa. Hitch meanwhile is more naturally curious more willing to let his mind wander as he ponders his place in the universe. He sees shades of gray where Cole sees only black and white. Not many shades mind you but Cole is so single-minded of purpose that over time the difference proves striking. Harris is quite good as Cole - if you want the steely-eyed man of few words hes your man - but Mortensen is outstanding as Hitch. For one thing with his thick goatee and sharp features he looks fascinating. Thats important because his use of expressions and reactions are essential to understanding him. Zellweger is less effective as Allison though its not entirely her fault. In such a deliberately paced film things move too fast with her making her characters relationship to the goings-on somewhat off-kilter (and shes not an interesting-enough actress to make up for it). Meanwhile Irons has a ball overplaying Bragg as a gentrified killer. Why he doesnt have a long mustache to twirl is anyones guess. Ambition is a great quality in a filmmaker especially when its realized. Yet there is something to be said for just telling a story and with Appaloosa Harris does a fine job of it.

Ed Harris working from a Robert Parker novel has crafted a meticulously detailed newfangled old-fashioned morality tale of hard men who go soft when a woman comes between them.And if its not particularly surprising ask yourself how often John Wayne Alan Ladd or Jimmy Stewart surprised us. Its not the novelty that sells this. Its the familiarity. In the New Mexico of 1882 a rich rancher ( Jeremy Irons a great villain) has put himself and his hired hands above the law. He has murdered the marshal and his deputies. The townsfolk want him reigned in. So they bring in hired guns (Harris and Viggo Mortsensen) men who take control change the laws and bring order by force of personality and the speed of their draw.Virgil Cole (Harris) always dressed in black has been doing this lawman-for-hire bit for a while. Is he fast? ""So far I been fast enough.""Everett Hitch (Mortensen) is the sensitive one as sensitive as a man who totes an 8-ga. shotgun can be.They confront the bad guy confront him again and when the breaks come their way arrest him and wait for the judge to show up for the trial. Theres the rub -- waiting for justice waiting for the henchmen to make their move.A pretty widow woman ( Renee Zellweger) has flounced into town and Virgil is instantly smitten. He has feelings. Thats not good. ""Feelings gitcha killed.""Everett clothed in shades of brown narrates our tale and corrects his partners grammar whenever Virgil stammers ""What word am I lookin for?""Heres one portentous. As in ""evil ominous."" Not to be confused with pretentious which Appaloosa most certainly is not. You just know Virgils new weakness will be on display loyalties tested and skills displayed when the good bad men and the bad guys gather for a showdown.""It happened quick.""""Everbody could shoot.""There isnt a false note in the script or a false step by this Oscar-coated cast. Lance Henriksen an old Harris acquaintance (The Right Stuff) rides in as a competing gunman and delivers Timothy Spall O makes a properly British town councilman. Harris stages a couple of nice shoot-outs a dandy stand-off on a train and made sure he cast friends compadres folks he has worked with who know how to look good on a horse. He keeps his story so simple that its easy to freight this with meaning modern metaphor about the freedoms you may or may not give up to stay safe and the different rules the rich play by.The boys talk a lot which works against the picture. But the familiar story-beats of Rio Bravo Rio Lobo The Rare Breed Ride the High Country Winchester 73 and every good Western that came before it work their magic.Too many recent installments in this genre have felt cut-rate cluttered overlong with a payoff that doesnt follow ""the code of the West."" Not Appaloosa. Harris immerses us in the sagebrush and reminds us of the old rules before he dares to bend them. Sometimes good guys wear black. Or brown.

For starters Bragg just shot three deputies who tried to arrest him and his lackeys have a tendency to test your quick-draw skills after a few whiskeys. And of course the inevitable pretty lady (Zellweger) will attempt to domesticate you asking you to pick out curtain patterns and such. Luckily sheriff Virgil Cole (Harris) and his longtime partner Everett (Mortensen) are watching each others backs and supplying plenty of flinty masculine banter. The Wild West should be tamed in no time. Ed Harriss oater doesnt try to reinvent the wagon wheel so much as build a sturdy carriage from old parts. Despite nods toward dispelling the genres mythology--gunshots are muted pops instead of reverbed Howitzer ka-pows--the actor director and cowriter opts to work intimately within a meat-and-potatoes formula. The model isnt Fords mournful epics or Manns psychological potboilers but the sagebrush case studies of Delmer Daves who treated the open range less as a character than as a backdrop for character development.But apart from the pleasure of hearing Harris and Mortensen trade old-married-couple quips (like so many Westerns its really a love story between two men) theres little to distinguish Appaloosa from its legion of ancestors. Only a brief showdown in a Mexican square suggests that Harris can use space to create tension and the dragging pace has sucked the air out by the time the climax rolls around. These are horse-opera fundamentals; having given them short shrift the film just shuffles down its lonesome trail into the horizon and out of your memory.

By David Denby Viggo Mortensen in a Western directed by Ed Harris.   Credit MARY ELLEN MARK/COURTESY WARNER BROS. Viggo Mortensen square-jawed dimpled and fit is a reserved man but hes very present in the here and now (women tend to find him irresistible). Ed Harris can be spiritually intense and as remote as an Antarctic explorer. As actors they have different kinds of appeal but theyre touching and funny together in ""Appaloosa"" as two men who share a gift for silence. Virgil Cole (Harris) and his ""deputy"" Everett Hitch (Mortensen) are guns for hire in the Old West--longtime partners who communicate mainly by glances nods a few gnomic words and a deepening stillness that can suddenly explode into violence. In 1882 they ride into Appaloosa a New Mexico frontier town and offer their services to the inhabitants who are terrorized by a rapacious landowner and gang leader (Jeremy Irons). They may be for hire but they fight on the weaker side because it pleases them to do so. Noblesse oblige. Harris who directed wrote the screenplay with Robert Knott from Robert B. Parkers 2005 novel and they have structured the picture as a traditional Western. (There are echoes of John Ford Howard Hawks Fred Zinnemann and many others.) The men are divided into protectors and predators and the movie features a series of confrontations in which the moral issues are clearly settled. ""Appaloosa"" is not as ambitious as last years ""310 to Yuma"" which provided an expansive social portrait of the Arizona territory after the Civil War but it has a distinctive humor and a fresh character in Allie French (Renee Zellweger). At first Allie seems to be the usual refined lady from the East she wears silk dresses pours coffee smiles and plays the piano (a little). But she shifts her loyalties among a group of men some of them unsavory. A ""bad"" woman in town the prostitute Katie (Ariadna Gil) understands her well enough. ""Mostly the men worry about love"" Katie says meaning that women in the West have to worry about staying alive. Allie looking for a protector claims Virgil breaking up the mens chaste straightback-mountain love story. But the relation between man and woman the movie suggests will never be as pure as the male bond. The Western has been stirring to life in recent years not only because it offers an escape from the modern world but also because it offers an escape from modern movie technology. From the opening scenes we know that ""Appaloosa"" wont be a fantasia in which the performers get tossed around by digital salad forks. Harris and his cinematographer Dean Semler shot the film near Santa Fe and they calmly lay out a vast terrain of gray-brown buttes and valleys with endless blue sky above. Harris respects the genres pictorial grandeur its regard for honor its solemn conventions; this movie is grounded. Fear has sucked the life out of the sun-bleached town with its adobe and wood buildings its drab bar its underemployed prostitute. (Hitch changes that last situation.) Theres no law no newspaper and when a trial has to be mounted a judge brought in from out of town turns the affair into farce. The Old West melancholy and lonely comes off as a bleak and scary place. There may be no law but Virgil Cole certainly embodies authority. ""Appaloosa"" is in part a story about hero worship. Hitch who narrates tells us that hes been to West Point and fought in the Civil War and against the Indians but he got out of soldiering because it didnt allow for much ""expansion of the soul."" Its not clear how working for a gunslinger expands the soul but Hitch is convincingly obsessed with his boss. Mortensen his eyes partly hidden under a round-brimmed hat has a dandys wide mustache and spadelike beard and he cocks his head at odd angles and stares at Ed Harriss character as if he were a god in boots. Virgil is fearless violent indomitable; hes also a bit crazy and Hitch takes care of him reining him in now and then. Harris has an unreachable-American-hero quality; hes still the blue-eyed icon of resolve that he first revealed in his performance as John Glenn in ""The Right Stuff"" (1983). The planes of his face seem lengthened under his black hat. Hes clean-shaven a sign of fanaticism in a country of scraggly beards. Of all the cinematic genres the Western has stayed closest to its silent-movie roots. Gary Cooper never said much in his cowboy roles though as he got older his aura of tragic stoicism became better than speech. Clint Eastwood in his spaghetti-Western days spoke so slowly that he could just as easily have etched his sentiments in stone. ""Appaloosa"" turns the inarticulateness of the Western hero into an elaborate joke. Virgil a self-made man carries a small volume of Emerson around with him and puzzles out ""Self-Reliance"" but at work in the middle of some tense moment he depends on Hitch to help out when the words dont come to him. ""Commiserate"" Hitch says filling in the blank when Virgil offers mock sympathy to a mean cowboy. Even Jeremy Ironss gangster pitches in. ""Sequestered?"" he asks with annoyance naming his own situation when Virgil holds him in jail for trial. Harriss view is that the small-town Old West is struggling to realize itself its a civilization that hasnt been articulated yet; it has values but no words no goods. In a strange and wonderful scene local Indians after a raiding party on Allie and some friends exchange her captured corset for a horse on the assumption that such an oddity must be a thing of great value. Virgil is pleased by Allies refinement though Hitch of course is discomforted by the way she pulls Virgil away from him. When it turns out that she takes her corset off more than she should the two men are baffled; to them women are either wives or whores and Allie is a little of both. Harris conveys the confusion of the two with considerable delicacy. As a woman of mixed morals Zellweger has a touchingly desperate quality as if a smile would make all her betrayals go away but her part is thinly written--there isnt enough script for her to create a full character. In all ""Appaloosa"" is good as far as it goes--everything in it feels true--but I wish that Harris had pushed his ideas further. At the end the movie reverts to traditional Western themes loyalty obligation the defining duel. During that last gunfight you can feel the air going out of your response though the formal closure of the movie--the ritual push on to a new frontier new challenges--offers its own kind of happiness. Al Pacino and Robert De Niro acting together as aging N.Y.P.D. detectives in ""Righteous Kill"" are anything but quiet. Indeed they send up a howling wind of boasts profane stories lewd jokes denunciations of criminals mutual expressions of admiration and reassurances of their own virtue as cops. Ive heard more enlightening dialogue in an Upper Broadway bar at closing time but the two go at it furiously as if raw humor and mawkishness were somehow the soul of humanity. The movie written by Russell Gewirtz and directed by Jon Avnet sends the men racing around town (though parts were shot in New York theres not much feel for the place) in one of those plots about a serial killer who leaves clues behind. This killer eliminates bad guys--pimps child murderers--and deposits poems at the scene of his crime. Suspicion is thrown on one character but it turns out that an elaborate trick has been played on us. This ruse however brings us not the elation of seeing a mystery solved but the chagrin of having been cheaply taken in. Trying to cover the holes in the story Avnet who also made the execrable ""88 Minutes"" also starring Pacino (how could he have worked with this director twice?) chops the episodes up into fragments runs dialogue over unconnected visual material and ends sequences before their meaning is made clear and through it all the stars keep banging away at their lines like two subway cars that dont quite fit on the tracks. The movie is hectic exhausting and baffling. Its an embarrassment and not just because Pacino with his pouchy eyes looks much too worn to be chasing killers and De Niro is patently too heavy-spirited for the lovely teasing Carla Gugino with whom his character is having some sort of ""hot"" sadomasochistic affair. (They stage mock rapes in her apartment.) Its an embarrassment because the two greats carry enormous amounts of movie lore around with them and we keep waiting for the moods to settle down enough for some of the old associations to resonate and it never happens. Pacino the cutup lets his voice go high and throws his arms up while De Niro scowling and pulling down the corners of his mouth seems permanently disgusted. It should be a sign of life that they havent turned into softies but if theyre going to keep playing tough guys they have to work with better material than this.

So yes this smallish fantasy is a comic riff on ""The Sixth Sense"" which has gone from thriller to cliche in nine years. And yes the new film which David Koepp directed from a script he wrote with John Kamps is inevitably deadened by contrivance. But its enlivened by the performance of Ricky Gervais as Bertram Pincus a latter-day Scrooge for whom the living are no less annoying than the dead. ENLARGE From left Ricky Gervais Tea Leoni and Greg Kinnear in ""Ghost Town"" Everett Collection Mr. Gervais is the British comedian who played the smug office manager in the original BBC version of ""The Office."" At first his performance here is a model of unyielding almost plaintive misanthropy in the face of Mr. Koepps otherwise broad comic style. A Manhattan dentist who uses the appliances of his trade to silence garrulous patients Pincus genuinely dislikes people and Mr. Gervais only intensifies his characters acidity when the dentist finds himself bedeviled by a group of needy nudgy ghosts. (Since the trailer will tell you exactly how and why this happens I wont.) Chief among the spectral nuisances is Greg Kinnears Frank Herlihy a dead man walking the sidewalks of New York in the dinner jacket he was wearing when he died. He wants Pincus to break up the impending re-marriage of his widow Gwen an archaeologist played by Tea Leoni. As the fable wears on Franks beseechments get to be repetitive and Pincuss flintiness runs low on verve. For all the brilliance of his success in TV Mr. Gervais doesnt have extensive experience as an actor in feature films and Mr. Koepp isnt the director to help him. Courtesy of Paramount Pictures. His performance grows more appealing -- the genuine animus gives way to some sweetness -- once the relationship between Pincus and Gwen moves beyond some elaborately unfunny antics involving a mummy and the script starts to give its Scrooge a new appreciation of life. (Id almost forgotten what a fine comedienne Ms. Leoni can be until a scene with her entering an elevator.) Eventually though ""Ghost Town"" buckles beneath the weight of contrivance -- so many ghosts to dispel so many lessons to learn. And the films physical aspects raise questions about population density. For a while we seem to be watching a for-ghosts-only version of Manhattan where the sidewalks are uncrowded and traffic moves freely in the streets. But no this is not the case. The living live there too though in such small numbers as to enjoy plenty of lebensraum. Thats the ultimate fantasy. The Duchess During one moment of excitement in ""The Duchess"" an 18th-century costume drama starring Keira Knightley as the Duchess of Devonshire Georgiana Spencer the unhappy heroine gets tipsy at a big party and has a frightening encounter with a candelabras flames. ""Please put out her graces hair"" her dour husband commands and the deed is done in the nick of time. The production is lavish the star is lovely and her character occupies a special place in English history as a great beauty a great wit a great model of proto-feminism and the great-great-great-great-aunt of Princess Diana. Whats missing is dramatic fire. Also in Weekend JournalActress Keira Knightley on big wigs the Di debate and the new movie The Duchess. Adviser Knightleys Noble Again You might not know that if you watched with the sound turned off. All the pieces of a powerful drama look to be in place -- a passionate young woman who for all her celebrity and star power might just as well be the late princess; Georgianas implacably dispassionate husband William the 5th Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes); Georgianas best friend Bess (Hayley Atwell) who turns their marriage into a menage a trois; and a backdrop of reform politics in a time of tumultuous change. With the sound turned on the campaign oratory could pass for proto-McCain/Obama but thats a minor distraction or amusement. The major deficits lie in the script which was adapted from the scintillating biography by Amanda Foreman and in what the director Saul Dibb has made of it. Instead of scintillation the movie gives us a succession of discrete set pieces as if the action takes place in rooms but not in the halls connecting them; dialogue that plays on the surface of Georgianas brilliance without getting under her skin let alone into her soul and a resolutely glum portrayal by Mr. Fiennes that may be true to Williams character but leaves us yearning for less. Princess Di deserves livelier revisionism. Appaloosa As for the woman in ""Appaloosa"" a Western directed and co-written by Ed Harris no one can accuse her of being a proto-feminist. Allison French a young widow played by Renee Zellweger wants nothing more or less than to get her hooks into the top hand in town whoever he may be. (Were also told that shes attracted to the boss stallion but he is not by way of keeping things clear a horse.) Mr. Harris plays Appaloosas city marshal Virgil Cole a rigid moralist who falls for Allie as he has never fallen before. Viggo Mortensen -- the two men appeared together in ""A History of Violence"" -- is Virgils deputy and steadfast friend Everett Hitch and Jeremy Irons is the bad-guy rancher Randall Bragg who runs the town until the two lawmen challenge his ruthless reign. Given Allies obviously unpleasant proclivities its hard to understand why Virgil loves her so ardently. But its equally hard to understand why Allie doesnt see that Virgils moral code masks a violent psychopathic streak or why that streak comes and goes without anyone ever discussing it. Or why for that matter ""Appaloosa"" is so mannered episodic and slow though it can be a danger sign when a movie is directed by one of its stars and carries credits for eight producers. Lakeview Terrace ""Lakeview Terrace"" occupies the bottom of the weeks barrel. This joyless and airless suspense thriller stars Samuel L. Jackson as Abel Turner a veteran LAPD cop whose smoldering racism explodes into assaultive fascism when a young interracial couple moves into the house next door. (Theyre played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington.) The model for this genre is Sam Peckinpahs surpassingly bleak and superviolent ""Straw Dogs"" but Abel has been written as a straw man and Mr. Jackson an actor of formidable gifts plays him with the subtlety of a robot stuck in destruct mode. The question posed by the vulgar script is whether the earnestly liberal couple -- he drives a Prius -- will withstand the tensions that Abels bigotry foments and stand up to their neighbors tyranny. The answer is yes on both counts and they cope with raging brushfires in the bargain. The movies only mark of restraint is the absence of an earthquake. DVD TIP Ive recommended ""Truly Madly Deeply"" before. Nows a perfect time to recommend it again. The late Anthony Minghellas first feature made in 1991 is a witty gorgeously lyrical and infinitely superior alternative to ""Ghost"" which came out the previous year. Juliet Stevenson is Nina drowning in grief since the death of her musician lover. Alan Rickman is the musician Jamie who unfazed by his death hangs out at Ninas house and invites dead friends to keep him company.

"Spottiness undermines entertaining Appaloosa - USATODAY.com Cars  Auto Financing  Event Tickets  Jobs  Real Estate  Online Degrees Shopping SearchHow do I find it?Subscribe to paper Home News Travel Money Sports Life Tech Weather Life >> Movies Box Office Report Movie Listings Awards Central Shop for Movies/DVDs Spottiness undermines entertaining Appaloosa Updated  | Comment  | Recommend E-mail | Print | Enlarge Warner Bros. Pictures Viggo Mortensen plays a lawman for hire. ABOUT THE MOVIE Appaloosa  1/2 (out of four)Stars Ed Harris Viggo Mortensen Jeremy Irons Renee Zellweger Timothy SpallDirector Ed HarrisDistributor New Line CinemaRating R for some violence and languageRunning time 1 hour 55 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Appaloosa is an old-fashioned-style Western that vaunts the classic values of the genre but has a modern sensibility. The dialogue based on Robert B. Parkers novel and co-written by director and star Ed Harris is a major asset in a film that is entertaining but somewhat unfocused and occasionally badly cast. CLIP Catch a preview of Appaloosa The movies undeniable highlight is the chemistry and camaraderie between Harris and Viggo Mortensen who are lawmen for hire called in to clean up a lawless town being run by a ruthless well-spoken outlaw played by Jeremy Irons. If that casting sounds odd it is. Its hard to see Irons with his lean almost effete grace as an intimidating villain and trigger-happy hothead. He doesnt seem to have the rough-hewn charisma or overbearing quality that would inspire the fierce loyalty of his band of rough characters. Also his character may be well connected (hes believed to be friendly with President Chester Arthur) but there is no indication he is supposed to be British. His English accent creeps into his Western-speak creating an unusual patois. Another questionable casting choice was Renee Zellweger as a piano-playing widow who comes into town parses who the powerbroker is and makes a play for Harris. Then she makes an advance toward Mortensen. And on it goes. But we dont have any idea of her motivations. She doesnt do much to fill in the blanks in the script and comes across as a cipher in a petticoat. The films funniest line though unprintable is one in which Harris character puzzles over her free-loving ways while judiciously complimenting her cleanliness and ability to ""chew her food nice."" Appaloosas greatest appeal is as a buddy picture. Harris and Mortensen seem like Butch Cassidy and his pal the Sundance Kid fused with a good-natured long-married couple. They understand each other without speaking though Mortensen often provides the right word for Harris when hes at a loss. Its a pleasure to watch such gifted actors interact in a classic genre.

"Pair of wild westerns shows renewed interest in the genre | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsPair of wild westerns shows renewed interest in the genreIs that a western revival on the horizon or is the genre headed for the last roundup? The enthusiasm of the makers of two oaters opening today suggests genuine renewal.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Sept. 19 2008 Appaloosa (out of 4)Starring Ed Harris Viggo Mortensen Renee Zellweger and Jeremy Irons. Directed by Ed Harris. 114 minutes. At the Varsity. 14A Sukiyaki Western Django (out of 4)Starring Hideaki Ito Kaori Momoi Yoshino Kimura and Quentin Tarantino. Directed by Takashi Miike. 121 minutes. At AMC Yonge-Dundas. 18A Is that a western revival on the horizon or is the genre headed for the last roundup?The enthusiasm of filmmakers suggests genuine renewal and two oaters opening today span the vast breadth of interest. Whether filmgoers will respond with more than their usual indifference is harder to call than a midnight gunfight.Appaloosa by actor/director Ed Harris pays tribute to tradition saluting the likes of John Ford Howard Hawks and Sam Peckinpah in its unhurried appreciation of hat horse and heroics. Sukiyaki Western Django by contrast is Takashi Miikes frantic swirl of a spaghetti western marrying eastern and western elements in what could be taken as either homage or parody - or both.Its 1882 and the dust clouds swirl like the wrath of God in the New Mexico hamlet big-saddled enough to call itself the City of Appaloosa but hired guns Virgil (Ed Harris) and Everett (Viggo Mortensen) dont pay them any mind. Theyve come to restore order and bring justice to the murderer Bragg (Jeremy Irons) a vile rancher who considers himself above the law and who treats Appaloosa like his private preserve. When two lawmen show up to arrest him for a heinous crime Bragg barely sets down his cup of coffee before cocking his rifle for some summary justice. Virgil and Everett arent afraid of Bragg. Theyve dealt with worse than him. They call what they do ""gun work"" and theyve been at it for so long together they dont even have to speak to know what the other is thinking. Its almost as if theyre married.Theyre like Butch and Sundance or maybe Joel McCrea and Randolph Scotts characters from Ride the High Country. Its fascinating to see Harris and Mortensen working and bantering as allies after watching them at lethal odds in David Cronenbergs A History of Violence.Cleaning up dirty towns is a career for Virgil and Everett and all they require is absolute control to get the job done. Appaloosa official grant it reluctantly and Virgil and Everett get right to it. But the arrival of flirtatious newcomer Allison (Renee Zellweger) sets ""the bees amongst the butter"" to use one of the many vivid phrases in the screenplay by Harris and Robert Knott working from the novel by Robert B. Parker.Virgil immediately sets his eye on the piano-playing Allison who swears shes no whore. ""She very clean"" Virgil tells Hitch. ""Chews her food nice.""It seems that Virgil may be about to violate his own tough oath ""Feelings get you killed."" And that could happen sooner than later since Bragg isnt planning to send flowers to any wedding only a funeral.Harris follows his strong helming debut Pollock with a contribution to the western movie revival that looks and sounds like a classic. His cast picks are offbeat - whod have figured Zellweger for a love interest and Irons for a thug? - but theyve been made with intelligence and an eye for inner depth.A fascination for the details and dress of daily life gives Appaloosa the feel of a real town where genuine people live and die.Japans Takashi Miike approaches the western from an entirely different direction but with less no passion. Sukiyaki Western Django crosses the plains from East to West by way of Sergio Corbuccis Django Sergio Leones A Fistful of Dollars and Akira Kurosawas Yojimbo.Its the old story of the mysterious stranger who comes to a town thats in the midst of a battle between two warring factions.The stranger in this case is played by Hideaki Ito the town is a fantasy Asia redoubt in Nevada and the war is being fought between rival gangs called the ""whites"" and the ""reds.""A visual stylist Miike never fusses much with logic even though it makes perfect sense to show how westerns often have a lot of eastern in them. His sets look garishly fake and painted (which they are) the weapons range from arrows to machine guns and the characters speak a form of English so weird and stilted you still need subtitles. (This is Miikes first English-language film and fluency obviously wasnt a major requirement.)Sukiyaki opens with a cameo appearance by Quentin Tarantino a kindred spirit and fellow genre shaker. He shoots a rattlesnake for a snack while dispatching threatening gunslingers and dispensing his own brand of mystic philosophy.Its a lot of nonsense as is much of the picture which has just a couple of decent fight scenes. Its hard to get too caught up in the struggles between the combatants since only the women - Kaori Momoi and Yoshino Kimura - display any sense of humanity and thats only because theyre getting even for terrible things men have done to them.""Paybacks a bitch"" a character says and so is making much of this Sukiyaki which is a few degrees shy of a hot dish. It almost seems that Miike is too reverential to the western reluctant to stray too far from the ranch.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsDundas St. W.s Fugo Desserts serves up a smores coneIf you cant make it to a campfire this summer this treats for youNewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Appaloosa. (R) New Line/Warner Bros. (107 min.) Directed by Ed Harris. With Harris Viggo Mortensen Renee Zellweger Jeremy Irons. Opens Friday at theaters in New York. THREE STARS Like any genre film a Westerns got to decide whether its going to embrace the myth or shun it. ""Appaloosa"" a carefully crafted new film from Ed Harris does one. And then it does the other. That change in approach doesnt quite work -- it comes late in the film and ends up sucking some of the air out of the third act -- but it doesnt detract from many of the movies pleasures. And those include a quiet attention to detail some careful camerawork and several remarkable faces. From the beginning the movie announces its interest in classic storytelling. This isnt a revisionist bit of mythbusting (like last years ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") Nor is it a modern neo-Western like ""No Country for Old Men"" or even ""There Will Be Blood."" Instead right from the titles the music and the unnecessary narration we know where we are -- in a land of stalwart sheriffs of few words powerfully devoted deputies and shady ladies who are nonetheless awful purty. ""Appaloosa New Mexico 1882"" the titles tell us but Id put it closer to ""Rio Bravo"" circa 1959. Nothing wrong with that territory. Nothing wrong with these actors either. Ed Harris has the kind of head that would look great on a coin but it looks even better on a movie screen as he turns his chiseled features this way and that. He is Virgil Cole here and he is a lawman for hire with a reputation. Viggo Mortensen Harris nemesis from ""A History of Violence"" is here too and he is period perfect (and ""Eastern Promises"" fans will be sorry to hear completely clothed). He is Coles man and that is all he or you need to know. And then there is Jeremy Irons as the silky-mannered big rancher who has a lot of ugly guns for hire at his disposal. And Renee Zellweger as the mysterious widow who arrives in town with a dollar and a past she wont discuss. And once you combine all four add some lust and anger and bring to a boil -- well out come the peacemakers. Forget the extended Sergio Leone action sequences too. If Harris looks to Howard Hawks for the honor he gives male friendship its old samurai films that inspire his split-second dead-before-you-hit-the-ground duels. But then as Virgil himself observes when men know what theyre doing these things tend to be quick. Quick too though is a third-act shift as one of the characters suddenly loses some of their signature drive. Psychologically it makes perfect sense. But the change from classic horse opera to sensitive psychological study is abrupt; the new passivity of one character leaves a hole and other characters hurrying to wrap things up. But third acts are often troublesome and ""Appaloosa"" isnt the first Western to face it. (Last years ""310 to Yuma"" had a similar -- and opposite -- problem when it tried in its final scenes to lurch from gritty 70s auteur picture to pre-fab studio entertainment). And Harris film can weather it better than most. After all it has those first 60 or so mythic minutes. It has that fine supporting cast including the reliable Irons and Zellweger -- whose charms remain elusive but still deserves credit for playing one of the genres more flawed heroines. It has the rangy Mortensen who looks so right he seems to have stepped out of a Daguerreotype. And it has the flinty Harris -- who like true flint has the remarkable ability to stand still in this moving world and allow the most remarkable sparks to be struck from him. Rating note The film contains violence strong language and sensuality. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Last years crop were either pretentious (""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") or ramped up the violence to absurd excess (the remake of ""310 to Yuma""). Ed Harris though directs the old-school Western ""Appaloosa"" in a refreshingly straightforward style. Its as no-nonsense as his lead performance as Virgil Cole a leathery gunfighter with nerves of steel. He is hired by the city of Appaloosa in the New Mexico Territory. Click here for photos of Appaloosa Its 1882 and city fathers (led by Timothy Spall) want the streets made safe for business after rancher Randall Brigg (Jeremy Irons in an intriguing bit of casting) has killed the marshal. So they hire Virgil who arrives with his longtime deputy Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) and suspends the citys laws in favor of his own much stricter ones. Given that Harris bears more than a passing resemblance to a certain Republican presidential candidate it looks for a spell like Harris and his co-screenwriter Robert Knott might be fixing to offer up a political allegory in this reverse twist on ""High Noon."" Fortunately Harris heads off in a more interesting direction in an adaptation that sticks close to a novel by Robert B. Parker including much witty dialogue taken directly from the printed page. Virgil and Everett are two of the more talkative Western heroes weve seen in a while and their exact relationship is intriguing. Everett tells us in narration that Virgils contact with women has been limited to ""whores and squaws."" Indeed the new marshals motto is ""feelings get you killed."" So Everett is possibly jealous certainly bemused and finally concerned when a piano-playing widow named Allison French (Renee Zellweger in her first tolerable performance since ""Cold Mountain"") arrives in Appaloosa and his smitten pal begins building a house for her. Things come to a head as Virgil puts Randall on trial for murder and the widow is abducted. Harris whose only previous directorial effort was the vastly different ""Pollock"" has an abiding affection and affinity for the Western paying homage to ""Rio Bravo"" among more obvious sources. Beautifully photographed by Dean Semler ""Appaloosa"" is the best Western since ""Open Range"" (2003) and shows theres still life in this most unfashionable of genres. APPALOOSA Best Western. Running time 115 minutes. Rated R (violence profanity).

At area theaters (154). R Violence language. Theres little to dislike about this relatively straightforward Western directed by Ed Harris. But theres not much to indicate why Harris felt it needed to be made either. He and Viggo Mortensen play 19th-century lawmen who hire themselves out to towns overrun by bad guys. Their job is never easy but its rarely been more difficult. For one thing their latest target (Jeremy Irons) fights mean. And for another a flirtatious widow (Renee Zellweger) is fast becoming a dangerous distraction. Though the leads do fine work their efforts often feel slightly futile. Despite a few flashes of the darker tone percolating under the surface the movie remains too well-mannered to truly pull us in. - Elizabeth Weitzman IGOR 2 1/2 stars A hunchback lab assistant wants to be an evil scientist. With voices of John Cusack Steve Buscemi Molly Shannon. At area theaters (126). PG Comic action. Sparky voice performances and heart make up for this family films theft of Tim Burtons sensibility. In a spooky land familiar from horror films Igor (John Cusack) is a hunchbacked lackey who yearning to become a mad scientist builds a girl monster (Molly Shannon) for a contest. Eddie Izzard and Steve Buscemi give fun turns as a master builder and an unkillable cat respectively but the movie likely wont come alive for younger kids despite the creature sharing the name of WALL-Es robot love. - Joe Neumaier BATTLE IN SEATTLE 1 star Drama about the clashes at the 1999 WTO conference. With Charlize Theron Woody Harrelson Michelle Rodriguez. At area theaters (138). R Violence language. Well-intentioned but as earnest as a college freshman discovering campus politics actor Stuart Townsend in his directing debut would have been better off making a documentary about the disastrous clash at the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting. Trying to blend fiction and starring a willing ensemble (Ray Liotta as the conflicted mayor comes off best) its like a class play by the Students for a Democratic Society. Noble as their intentions were the peaceful combatants blamed for the citys descent into chaos were as naive in their long view as this movies storytelling is cliched.  Joe Neumaier HOUNDDOG 1 star A child in 1950s Alabama tries to escape her violent life through music. At the Village 7 (133). R Violence rape. Rarely has there been a movie as misguided as ""Hounddog"" which self-righteously indulges in exploitation while loudly decrying it. There are problems with every aspect of this Southern Gothic nightmare from Deborah Kampmeier. We could complain about the swampy symbolism the hackneyed story lines and the odious racial cliches. But worst of all is the sight of 12-year-old Dakota Fanning in little more than her underwear as a young victim of all kinds of abuse including rape. Shes excellent in an awful role but she should never have been asked to embody it. There are ways to handle such serious subject matter. This sure isnt one of them. - Elizabeth Weitzman A THOUSAND YEARS OF GOOD PRAYERS 3 stars An aging Chinese man tries to understand his modern daughter. At the Lincoln Plaza (123). Not rated. In English Mandarin and Farsi with subtitles. In Wayne Wangs quietly moving drama an elderly Chinese father approaches his daughter as if she were a stranger. Visiting Yilan (Faye Yu) for the first time in years Mr. Shi (Henry O) is baffled by her modern ways. Shes divorced she stays out late and she refuses to give him a grandchild. Worst of all none of this Westernized behavior seems to be making her happy. Very little actually happens since most of the time Mr. Shi sits alone in Yilans empty apartment wondering how to help her.

You think we do this kinda work cause we scared to die?"" So speaks Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) about his sidekick Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) as the two stare down a posse of bad guys in Appaloosa New Mexico circa 1882. Cole and Hitch who are good at killing but try to ply that skill for the right side of the law are the new marshal and deputy and that posses determined to spring its boss Randall Bragg from jail. A rancher with no cattle but nefarious plans for taking over the town Bragg (Jeremy Irons king of suave menace) is also an itchy-fingered killer having shot the last town marshal right off his horse. Hell surely hang but only if Cole and Hitch can hold on to him until the trial -- and we all know what slowpokes those traveling judges can be.While they wait Cole falls hard for Allie (Renee Zellweger) a widow who wears her hair in a schoolmarms bun but is about as faithful as a dance-hall working girl. She even puts the moves on Hitch who kisses her back (as any cowboy would) and then pushes her away declaring ""Im with Virgil. And so are you.""If most of the dialogue in the pleasantly old-fashioned Appaloosa has a zingy precision thats because Ed Harris who directs from a screenplay he co-authored is smart enough to quote -- almost scene by scene and word by word -- from Robert B. Parkers 2005 novel (to which a sequel Resolution has just been published). It could be said that Harris and his co-writer Robert Knott havent done a whole lot of writing but as Cole himself might say theres no need to get all fancy with whats plain and true.Appaloosa has the shifting boundaries of friendship and love on its mind but this isnt a movie likely to raise comparisons to the tortured revisionism of Unforgiven or even to last years hyperactive shoot-em-up 310 to Yuma -- and thats surely fine by Harris. He and his collaborators are playing it straight with a timeless male fantasy -- horse hat six-shooter -- a traditional approach that will please moviegoers like my dad and yours men who walked out of No Country for Old Men puzzled feeling like theyd been cheated out of a climactic gun battle between lawman and villain.

Sep. 12 600pm Paleyfest Previews Fall TV On NBC Tickets Tue. Sep. 13 600pm Harris keeps the shootouts coming -- theres even a run-in with some canny Indians -- but in this efficient Western there are no close-ups of shifting eyes and nervous trigger fingers just sudden over-in-a-blink violence. Truth be told it probably wouldnt have killed the director to belabor the tension a little more but hey real men dont drag things out.A four-time Oscar nominee including a Best Actor nod for Pollock which he also directed Harris specializes in portraying men whose excess machismo hasnt turned them mean who watch and carefully measure the world before making their move. So Virgil Cole who is slow and deliberate and also the fastest draw in the West should be the perfect role for him; and yet oddly Harris often appears to be not quite centered within himself as if Harris the director hadnt found a way to help Harris the actor be as still as Cole needs to be.Holding ones body still in front of a movie camera while also giving the sense of a mind in motion is a specialized art one with few masters. Paul Newman comes to mind notably in his later career as does Robert Duvall a perennial movie cowboy who will surely wish that Appaloosa had come his way. And now it would seem there is Viggo Mortensen who steals this film by doing nothing much more than lean against doorways and bar counters. Like Harris Mortensen is a great listener and good listeners -- in life and in movies -- barely move. That quality is just right for the role of Hitch whose life hangs on Coles next word and slightest gesture. Its an old truth and not just about Westerns When the talking stops the dying begins.

Maybe its no surprise that the results are mixed. Ed Harris who directed the film ?(its his first time behind the camera since Pollock eight years ago) also stars as Virgil Cole a roving freelance law enforcer of? the 1800s who shows up in the town of ?Appaloosa along with his taciturn sidekick Everett (Viggo Mortensen). For a price they offer to rid the town of Randall Bragg? a sneering bully and killer played by Jeremy Irons in what could almost be a grungier? impersonation of Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood. Irons is enjoyably nasty enough to make you wonder why no one thought to cast him in a Western before. Harris for his part comes off as a classic sure-shot protector -- that is until he beats up a loser in a bar with so much more violence than is necessary that the film seems to be saying this lawman is a bit of a sociopath too. (The actors icy gleam certainly suggests it.) The movie though pulls back on this idea and after that scene Virgil is never as interesting. Appaloosa is a pleasingly spacious piece of work but for all of its little tangles it never musters the kick of a psychological duel. Renee Zellweger as the peach-blossom-fresh Allison is the most amoral character here -- a woman who loves whomevers around -- but except ?for her Appaloosa is a throwback to the age when Westerns were quaint.
