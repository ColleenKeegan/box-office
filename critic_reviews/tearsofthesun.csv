More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

"Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters Story of My Life Hair Today Gone Tomorrow By Ralph Gardner Jr.  05/26/03 1200am I was sorry when I learned that Michaels the well-known childrens hair-cutting salon at Madison Avenue and 90th Street went out of business recently. But not that sorry. Michaels was famous for cutting the hair of generations of preppies allegedly including John F. Kennedy Jr. I say allegedly because I never saw him there. And God knows I spent enough of my childhood in the barbers chair at Michaels that Id have run into him if hed been a regular. I got my first haircut at Michaels and every haircut after that until at the ripe old age of 16 I finally rebelled. Haircuts in my family were traumatic psychologically scarring events. The fault lay not with Mr. Michael as the salons owner was called or with his No. 2 man Mr. Gay both of whom gave a competent haircut. The problem was my mother. First there was the hair style shed invented for us. It was like nothing that existed in nature or even in science fiction. Well maybe science fiction It sprung from her fertile imagination like that creature in Alien . The easiest way to describe it is as a crewcut a Marine buzz cut-except that my mother God forbid would never let anything as proletarian as a razor near her four sons tender heads. Instead she insisted that we be trimmed to a state of virtual baldness-except in the front where we all sported Tom Sawyer-like cowlicks-with a scissors. To keep our hair just so required that we visit Michaels religiously every two weeks. And since my parents were apparently under the impression that the only way to cope with four boys was to treat them like military cadets or rather prisoners of war we all had our hair cut on the same afternoon every other week. And by the same barber. At first it was Mr. Gay a pleasant man with a business-like mustache-until he crossed my mom. From the age of 3 until I was 8 or 9 no one but Mr. Gay was allowed near my hair. Until suddenly one day without explanation my mother dropped him for Mr. Michael. It was disorienting for a child to say the least. So much importance did my mother attach to our appearance (and to our hair in particular) and so completely were we Mr. Gays customers that it was hardly less significant than if shed just filed for divorce from my father. I recently asked her why we abruptly switched from Mr. Gay to Mr. Michael a sweet-natured opera buff with the worlds bushiest eyebrows who ran the salon from Chair No. 1. At first my mother denied wed ever patronized Mr. Gay so utterly had she banished him from her memory. Eventually she admitted there must have been some falling out over hair. Its coming back to me now almost as if retrieved by hypnosis. Mr. Gay who seemed like a decent enough guy eventually balked at clipping our heads with a scissors. Since the final result was hairlessness he didnt see why he couldnt save lots of time-not to mention his mental health-by simply plugging in a razor. I was on his side. I cant exaggerate the exhaustion for all involved in going to Michaels. It was like getting your own hair cut four times on the same day. After I was through Id have to wait while my brothers got their hair cut my mother standing over the barber the whole time. The comic books and lollipops helped. But by the time my youngest brother Jamie slipped out of the barbers chair with his crewcut I was crawling the walls. We spent so much time at Michaels that historic events transpired while we were there. The great blackout of 1965 occurred during one of our biweekly visits. Unfortunately the lights didnt go out until our haircuts were finished and we were leaving. Not that that wouldve made any difference My mother wouldve simply insisted that Mr. Michael complete the job to her specifications by flashlight. This form of child abuse went on until June 1969 when Id just turned 16 and my mother sent me off on one of those eight-week cross-country ""teen tours."" She didnt realize the far-reaching consequences it would have for both my hair and our relationship. If shed known Im certain shed have forbidden me to go. Suffice it to say that I wasnt popular with the young ladies on the trip at least not at first. When its the Age of Aquarius and youre a 6-foot-2 125-pound hairless geek you arent going to attract women whose idea of handsome is Paul McCartney. I was stuck sharing hotel rooms with all the other losers on the bus because nobody not even my cousin would room with me. But something miraculous happened during the journey. My hair started to grow. And since I was on a bus crossing the country there was nothing my mother could do about it. The longer my hair got the more socially acceptable I became. Halfway through the trip the coolest guy on the bus-a rock musician who attended an alternative high school in Newton Mass.-decided I was hip or at least unconventional and became my roommate bless his heart. He remains a friend to this day. By the end of the vacation my hair was almost normal length and under his tutelage I was considered cool too. I even started having girlfriends. But I knew full well that this fantasy would soon end and I would be delivered back into the clutches of my mother and her evil scissors. So I had everybody on the bus sign a petition pleading with her to leave my hair alone. I delivered the document to her in Italy where I joined my family after the teen tour ended. Predictably she almost dropped dead when she saw my hair and insisted that I get it cut immediately. I agreed-on the condition that it remain a reasonable length. She concurred. But I should have known that when it came to hair my mother had no scruples. She was ruthless As soon as I was seated in the barbers chair she kept instructing the barber "" Piu corto  piu corto ""-shorter shorter. I didnt catch on until it was too late. When my haircut was finished it looked exactly as it had before Id departed on the trip. No longer a cool teen I was a heartbroken pinhead once more. To punish her I wore a hat everywhere even to dinner at fancy restaurants in the sweltering heat of the Italian summer and I never again let her near my hair. I also never went back to Michaels. The tragic thing is that by the time I finally got to wear my hair the way I wanted in college it was already starting to fall out. Now Michaels is a Face Stockholm makeup boutique. I suppose theres some poetic justice there. Its one of my daughters favorite stores a place where they love to try on lip balms and blushes and where theyre free to experiment with their appearance. If Id had that chance at 14-I dont mean being allowed to wear makeup but sporting the same bowl cut as J.F.K. Jr. and all the other guys-who knows how nicely I might have turned out? I guess its never too late to consider a hairpiece. Comment Filed under John F. Kennedy John F.

"Tears of the Sun is patriotic mush. Slate Sign In Sign Up Tears of the Sun is patriotic mush. Tears of the Sun is patriotic mush. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 7 2003 957 AM Shafted in Africa Bruce Willis wants out of Nigeria in Tears of the Sun. By David Edelstein Willis and Bellucci baldly manipulative Bruce Willis is a baldy in his new war film Tears of the Sun (Columbia) and the camera revolves around his dome like a helicopter around Mount Rushmore. As veteran Navy SEAL Lt. A.K. Waters hes supposed to be an emblem of modern war a stoic with the profile of an eagle whos battered past caring and follows orders without question. But Willis still has a trace of his characteristic 80s-TV-idol smirk. Its not really right for the role but it probably helps the movie seem less like a crock when he suddenly starts to gulp care--when he cocks his head quizzically and stares at the people he had previously regarded as ""packages"" like a Star Trek android feeling his first twinge of empathy. At times you could actually mistake Tears of the Sun for a blunt modern parable instead of an opportunistic mixture of up-to-the-minute atrocities and old-fashioned corn. Advertisement The movie directed by Antoine Fuqua (Training Day [2001]) begins off the coast of Africa where Waters is ordered to lead his elite squadron into the Nigerian countryside after a fictional--but not entirely far-fetched--coup by a military dictator and a protracted spasm of ""ethnic cleansing."" His task is to retrieve a Doctors Without Borders physician Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) from a Catholic mission in a remote village--in all likelihood soon to be overrun by guerrilla troops with a mandate to terminate with extreme prejudice. But the Italian-born doctor mulish do-gooder that she is wont leave without the villagers She wants Waters to get them to the Cameroon border which is against the lieutenants orders. And this lieutenant is an orders machine. If Waters says ""Sure these people would die otherwise lets get some more choppers"" and the Navy says ""Hey why not?"" then theres no movie. So Waters doesnt and the Navy doesnt--and then it becomes a battle of wills between the tempestuous Italian and the grimly efficient warrior. But its not much of a contest really at least in a Sony/Columbia entertainment. Those ragtag Nigerians theyre so sweet and helpless ... and theyll all die if left in the jungle ... and those guerrillas are such animals ... and Monica Bellucci ... que bella donna ... Heres the money scene The Navy SEALs and the 50 or so Nigerians pass by a village where a squadron of guerrillas is in the process of raping torturing and murdering men women and children. One of Waters men reports they have a ""ringside seat to an ethnic cleansing."" The lieutenant has orders not to engage the enemy. But can they walk away from these atrocities--and these blood-freezing cries? Down the embankment a guerrilla pours gasoline over a man on his knees then takes a lighter out of his pocket and holds it aloft. Waters turns to his teams ace sniper whos already in position. ""Zippo first"" says Bruce and the sniper says ""Yeah""--and Zippo after an agonizing couple of beats takes three in the chest. The SEALs are too late to save most of the villagers but when one American soldier pulls a guerrilla off a horribly mutilated woman with a dead baby he forces the killer to regard his handiwork--then he guts him. My own gut reaction--and I bet yours too--is easily stated Onward Christian soldiers Cleanse those ethnic cleansers I wonder if ""Zippo first"" will enter the lexicon along with Die Hards ""Yippie-ki-yay motherf---er."" When Waters discovers that among his refugees is the future leader of a democratic Nigeria and that hes being pursued by a relentless platoon commanded by icy Col. Idriss Sadique (Malick Bowens) and his superior a grinning human jackal he calls together his men and gives them a chance to sound off He wants to know what they think of his unprecedented show of humanitarian disobedience. Then he makes an amazing declaration. He says hes saving the villagers ""for all the years weve been told to stand down or stand by ... for our sins."" Advertisement Theres something about Tears of the Sun that rips me right down the middle. On one hand its an inspiring story of American valor and self-sacrifice. On the other it seems so far removed from the real world--from any action by any soldier at any recent time--that it amounts to a sort of opium dream of heroism a collective fantasy to make us feel better about ourselves on the eve of a controversial military action. This is how wed like Americans to be seen by the rest of the world as both great soldiers and great moral individualists--policing the planet and rescuing helpless civilians from barbarous regimes. Has any American platoon ever moved in to stop an ethnic cleansing? I dont know. But even U.N. troops charged with protecting civilians have a spotty record in Africa and the Balkans when it comes to engaging an exterminating enemy. This vision of a sensitive humanistic morally engaged (and enraged) American military is extremely appealing. But is it grounded in anything other than Hollywood opportunism and a national ego that seems given the record hugely inflated? Thats not a rhetorical question Id really like to believe that Tears of the Sun is more than self-deluding mush. As it stands it doesnt approach the serious political context the acid ironies the dizzying lack of moral gravity that David O. Russell brought to Three Kings (1999) another brutal war movie about soldiers moved to defy their superiors and do the right thing. Fuqua a music-video hotshot doesnt overmilk the primitive scenario by Alex Lasker and Patrick Cirillo. There are no fussy effects in the battle scenes just good scary passages of quiet before the storm then fast and fluid action. The director doesnt stint on the gore but he doesnt wallow in it either; the movie is horrifying without being sadistic. (Its too bad that Fuqua resorts to a war-movie cliche the ""Adagio for Strings"" type music that begins a few seconds before people we care about get shot.) But the opening which features actual footage of a civilian being shot many times by a Nigerian army officer at close range in the course of a melee is creepily exploitive even obscene You dont use a real-life atrocity as a prelude to a Hollywood fantasy of macho humanism co-starring this years international sex goddess. Dont misunderstand--Monica Bellucci is a brave and surprisingly down-to-earth actress. But when the Navy shows Waters and his squad her picture--she has big dark eyes and huge pillowy cover-girl lips--and they dont explode in whoops you know youre in a never-never land where warriors are chivalrous and African peasants give thanks in song to their Great American Saviors. This seems about as likely to me as rubbing Bruce Willis bald head and getting three wishes. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air.

Bruce Willis is a NAVY Seal who is sent to Nigeria to rescue a doctor (Monica Bellucci) in Tears of the Sun. Last years Harts War was set in a POW camp in Germany nearly 60 years ago. Sun is almost strictly outdoors except when Willis and his fellow Navy SEALs interrupt a doctors surgery and when Catholic mission locals are slaughtered in a church in Nigeria. Yet both movies are non-starters and neither shows Willis to good advantage. He begins to vaporize off the screen from underplaying. The most interesting thing about Sun is the timing of its release. This is a major Hollywood production that gives full-fledged approval to a story line that involves American soldiers wiping out Nigerian rebels at a time when the real-life debate over war in a faraway land grows more heated every day. Theres plenty of screen room to explore the intervention issue as long as a movie dramatizes specifics. But the characters here are strictly standard-issue which is the key reason the only powerful moment is an overhead shot of a slaughtered village. Review of the movie Tears of the Sun ( out of four) Stars Bruce Willis Monica Bellucci Tom Skerritt Cole Hauser Eamonn Walker Director Antoine Fuqua Distributor Columbia Rating R for violence some brutality and language Opens Friday nationwide Monica Bellucci plays the doctor and whatever else you want to say about Irreversible  she is an arresting screen presence. (Related item Read a review of Irreversible.) Here shes just one more good-looking actress losing her temper with a heavy accent though youd still think she could wake Lt. Willis just by standing next to him. The script keeps telling us that Willis is moved enough by the plight of the locals to turn a rescue mission into combat over the wishes of his captain (Tom Skerritt). But this is not exactly a movie that wills you to believe anything beyond the fact that its principals are in combat. As in Black Hawk Down which is also from Sony the sound of bullets seems to come at you from all directions including two blocks from your multiplex. The movie might have gotten a dramatic boost from its topical theme indirect as it is. Unfortunately its not one-tenth as interesting as what you can see at home during a nightly cable surf as U.S. war policy is debated.

Starring Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci. Directed by Antoine Fuqua. (R. 121 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""Tears of the Sun"" set in the midst of a Nigerian revolution is a rough slog through the jungle but it builds in intensity and takes on a certain grandeur as it goes along. Its a military action movie with scenes of blood slaughter and combat that look authentic. At its best its a little hard to sit through. At its worst its like every other picture about soldiers on a tough mission. What pushes it above mediocrity is that it ends better than it begins. Bruce Willis stars as a hardened Navy SEAL a lieutenant who starts with a shaved head and then as the mission wears on acquires a little more stubble every day as his hair grows in. Growing hair is about the flashiest thing Willis does in ""Tears of the Sun."" His acting has become so minimalist that its hard to imagine him doing anything less while retaining consciousness. Yet the impassive mask is not inappropriate for this veteran officer who has seen absolutely everything and none of it good. His mission He and his men must enter revolutionary Nigeria and rescue an Italian American doctor before the rebels come and slaughter her and everyone in her mission hospital. Dr. Kendricks an American by marriage is played by Italian actress Monica Bellucci (""Malena"") an international beauty though this is hardly a glamour role. Bellucci gets as dirty and grimy as Willis over the course of the film and at no point does anyone find a jungle pond where everyone can take off their clothes and get clean again. Its by disappointing audiences in this way that movies acquire an aura of integrity. Being a surgeon Dr. Kendricks is arrogant and headstrong. She insists on not abandoning her patients and so the lieutenant agrees to rescue them too. But soon we realize that Belluccis entire function in the film is to argue with Willis and miss the point of every situation. ""These people have been going for 30 hours"" the doctor yells insisting they be given a rest. Yes but rebels are chasing them. With machine guns and machetes. Maybe a nice long nap once they cross the border? That might be a better idea. Theres a monotony about the first hour of ""Tears of the Sun."" The doctor and the lieutenant keep clashing. They walk they rest they walk some more. But even here director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") throws in touches that assure us of a committed hand guiding the action. He persuades us for example to see the African patients through the eyes of the soldiers as people slowing down the mission and increasing the danger to them all. And then he shows us a man climbing an incline with an artificial leg. He takes us out of our selfishness and makes us feel the humanity of the situation. We make that inner journey and watch as the soldiers do too. Still I lost count of how many times the lieutenant tells the doctor to get her people together that theyre moving out. But as the movie starts cutting deeper becoming more harrowing more urgent it somehow also becomes more important. At one point the soldiers look down into a village and witness a massacre in progress. The soldiers can risk themselves by intervening or steer a path around it. ""Tears of the Sun"" begins with the Edmund Burke epigram ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" Though it has been in the pipeline for years it will be interpreted as a statement endorsing a vigorous American presence internationally whether in Iraq Kosovo or Africa. Agree or not ""Tears of the Sun"" emerges as a restrained and sober presentation of that viewpoint. . This film contains harrowing scenes of violence carnage and sexual assault.

Assigned to extract an American volunteer (Monica Bellucci) from the crisis zone Willis leads a ragtag group of African refugees in an escape from Marxist rebels. Director Antoine Fuqua mimics the tangled forest mayhem of Vietnam films like ""Platoon"" but theres not much distinction here between terror and kinesis - between the hell of war and the kick of war.

Uninvolving due to stick-figure characters and off-putting in its images of technology-enhanced Yanks striding like benevolent giants among helpless Third World victims this is one of those pictures that unavoidably becomes part of the zeitgeist due to its coincidental arrival at a precise moment in history when its themes play into current events. ""Tears of the Sun"" is Bruce Willis ""The Green Berets"" a film that weighs the merits of the United States acting as the worlds policeman and renders a judgment emphatically in the affirmative. Uninvolving due to stick-figure characters and off-putting in its images of technology-enhanced Yanks striding like benevolent giants among helpless Third World victims this is one of those pictures that unavoidably becomes part of the zeitgeist due to its coincidental arrival at a precise moment in history when its themes play into current events. All the same commercial prospects look to fall well short of the most recent major effort in this war film sub-genre ""Black Hawk Down"" due to soft title scripts reduction of complex issues into cliched platitudes and likely critical derision. In the present context this Sony release from Revolution Studios which is being promoted heavily on the rep of ""Training Day"" helmer Antoine Fuqua as well as on Willis star value is the anti-""The Quiet American"" the closest dramatic representation of ""compassionate conservatism"" Hollywood has produced. If the White House screening room is still in use ""Tears"" will no doubt move quickly to the top of the priority list and audience there will take the sort of inspiration it wants from the fadeout tagline provided by 18th century British politician Edmund Burke ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."" Scenarists Alex Lasker and Patrick Cirillo wrote their first draft in 1995 inspired by Robert Wises 1966 epic ""The Sand Pebbles"" in which a sailor played by Steve McQueen was among those charged with protecting a mission-based group during civil unrest in 1920s China. You can almost see Willis consciously aspiring to tough McQueen-style minimalism in his portrayal of Navy SEAL squadron leader Lt. A.K. Waters but all he achieves is emotional blankness as the reasons for this veterans sudden conversion from combat-hardened stoic to determined humanitarian are internalized to the point of invisibility. Waters orders from aircraft carrier-based Capt. Bill Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) are to rescue a Doctors Without Borders medic Lena Kendricks (Monica Bellucci) whos American by marriage from a Catholic mission in a small Nigerian village. Area is imminently threatened by hostile troops under the control of a rebel leader whos just deposed and killed the democratically-elected president in a military coup. But the impassioned Lena whose husband was murdered by the rebels wont depart without the locals who depend on her and who will certainly be killed if left behind. Waters tricks Lena into getting on the helicopter back to safety but as they pass over the village they witness the hideous slaughter thats taken place in their brief absence. After searching deep into his soul by staring out into space Waters orders the chopper to turn around whereupon he sends a dozen children and infirm ""indigenous personnel"" by air to a safe haven in nearby Cameroon and takes responsibility for leading Lena and the remaining 28 Africans through the jungle to the border. Despite the extreme situation and combustible possibilities drama never comes to life because its far more about the problem than the characters. Not a line of exposition or psychological profiling is devoted to fleshing Waters out; hes just a guy who believes in doing his job. Although as a lifer hes undoubtedly been exposed to similar tragedies in Vietnam Kuwait Somalia Bosnia or wherever what he sees in Africa gets to him in a way nothing ever has before. Why? Because he says ""I started to give a f--."" With a disapproving Capt. Rhodes informing Waters hes on his own since Yank aircraft is now prohibited from entering Nigerian airspace the lieutenant and his group shortly come across another small village where they witness ethnic cleansing. Unable to stand by as rebel soldiers rape and murder the citizens the Americans engage the marauders picking many of them off from a distance before entering the fray to finish the job. Although theyre now ""committed"" Waters asks all of his men what they think of their rescue mission. While one initially demurs to the effect that ""This isnt our f--ing war"" Waters is ultimately assured by one and all hes doing the right thing a sentiment reinforced by the effusive thanks and admiration extended to them by the natives who owe their lives to the bloodied-and-battered Yanks after the climactic battle with the ruthless red-capped rebels. In its own way pic points up the no-win situation when it comes to big-power intervention in Third World strife; at the time the script was conceived the Clinton Administration and the West in general was criticized in many quarters for ignoring the butchery in Rwanda and elsewhere in Africa whereas now the U.S. is under international siege for threatening to intrude where many believe it should not. The problem with the picture is that issues are presented in the crudest and most simplistic of terms without nuance irony or historical context. The men in Waters squadron are barely differentiated except for the black (Eamonn Walker) whose personal connection to the plight of the Africans is visually underlined. A deglamorized Bellucci channels scarcely modulated degrees of burning intensity into her role as the deeply caring but psychologically wounded physician. Lushly backdropped film was shot in Hawaii and often looks it although authenticity is strengthened by the large group of Africans (including many refugees from the Sudan and elsewhere) recruited for secondary parts and as extras. Fuquas direction stresses the somber a mood increased by the frequent overcast and rain and lacks the electricity he brought to ""Training Day."" Hans Zimmers generally low-key score incorporates African motifs to OK effect and other behind-the-scenes contributions are pro.
