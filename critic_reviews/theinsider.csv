More often than not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about. Describing music is never easy which is why most journalistic shorthand to describe an artist or sound resorts to cheap genre descriptor pastiches and made-up meaningless new codifications. Once in a while those labels catch on but more often than not those descriptors are but the rare moment where that journalist can flex their creativity to take a chance describing something fresh and new allowing us some insight into what informs the associations that they make. All of which is to say sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? More often that not the music thats sent to me is difficult to write about because theres just no story there. And sometimes the music is good like really good which makes me feel as if the act of refusing to write about it does a disservice to the readers who trust my judgement. But heres the thing--very few people in journalism give arts journalists a fair shake and even fewer show love for music journalists. I have to at least entertain the idea that people who dont take music journalists seriously are responding to stories that get published for the wrong reasons--either the journalist just really likes the band and their enthusiasm gets the pitch approved despite the fact that they dont have much to say beyond ""its good"" and ""you should listen to it"" or the story has been thrust upon them by the publication for some other reason (either the editor loves it the artist or their crew have some sort of relationship with the publication or theyre just super-fucking popular.) Sounds are hard to put into words. But it helps when theres a good story there doesnt it? A faculty member at my alma mater CUNYs Graduate School of Journalism confirmed my suspicion that admissions was reluctant to accept prospective students who showed an interest in focusing on the Arts amp; Culture concentration over other beats--Health amp; Science Business International and Urban reporting. They just see too many arts journalists floundering after school he said and the commonly held belief by other faculty members was that in a field where finding work is already difficult arts journalists have an even harder time because the jobs just arent there. Whats more the powers that be often feel that the majority of young journalists attracted to arts reporting never evolve into anything more than armchair critics fans with half-baked opinions who favor feelings over facts. Our fearless Observer editor in chief Ken Kurson said something similar to me on my first day in his office. As much as he loved music journalism Ken felt that the majority of journalists who focused on music were just failed musicians themselves less concerned with producing good writing and reporting and instead ultimately looking for a spot on the tour bus. He didnt know at the time that Im a classically trained violinist whos been playing since I was four or that I have several solo records under my belt (Google at your own peril). Nor did I know at the time that he once played bass in the revered Chicago jangle-pop band Green. Either way I suddenly had something to prove and was up for it. My plan with writing if I ever had one was to unpack the ""why"" that informed the work of every artist I wrote about and looking for a raison detre quickly narrowed the pool of who had a good story I could tell. It was really still just a matter of those eternal news values--proximity timeliness prominence impact conflict and nostalgia. A shitty band is pushed upon me as either pure nostalgia or timeliness--theyre either ""progenitors of the new trance-metal"" or they ""long for the days when the sounds of disco..."" The other values are often pushed on me by a publicist. Theres conflict in a record that almost didnt happen after the singers crippling addiction to all-you-can-eat buffets; theres impact in dogmatically-worshiped statistics of chart performance or Soundcloud plays; and theres prominence ascribed to the band that once played Shia Labeoufs Bar Mitzvah or Sofia Vergaras Quinceanera too. But youve got to not only check off several of those news values to have a story--youve got to understand how they inform that artists life to tell their story. In arts journalism with its private parties and branded-content ""exclusive"" premieres maybe that yearning to say something larger gets diluted by the enticing visceral realities of the entertainment industry. Maybe too many publicists focus on writing the story or at least the storys nut graph containing the thesis ahead of time for most arts journalists to just lap up. To that end any stigma that arts features are less serious and more ephemeral than ""hard news"" falls on the shoulders of the editors and their writers who take press releases as scripture and conduct the extent of their reporting as only an amplification of a perspective that has already been shaped and subsequently fed to them. Your disco grind-metal band just released an album of Maroon 5 covers on MiniDisc? Please go on... Thats really a shame because the whole cosmic haw-haw of it all is that the arts for all the seeming short-lived ephemera of listening to a catchy song or watching an entertaining film are eternal. At its most haughty the act of creating something is a grasp at immortality the forging of a work that should last long after the creator is worm food. Hard neighborhood news meanwhile is service journalism--absolutely necessary information timely local and inherently valuable. You want to know when a man is stabbed in your neighborhood or when your favorite gelato chain is coming to your borough. But for all the hallowed seriousness of a local papers breaking-news desk the often palpable shade that reporters on the grind throw at arts journalists is straight-up unfair. Once the mime who kept exposing himself to old ladies on the B52 bus in Brooklyn has been apprehended the story is over. Meanwhile theres a whole world of people creating making shit with their hands and crafting their own legacy for no other reward than maybe a small taste of immortality. Perhaps one day the systematically disrespected and undervalued arts journalist will fade into myth. But its going to come from realizing that in the same way we marginalize our citys creative class by outsourcing creative works and art to freelancers and hired guns we treat our arts journalists with a similar arms-length disdain. Thats a shame because a good song or a good picture is far from ephemera. Like hard news arts journalism tells the story of our shared now. But unlike hard news the creative work that lasts also tells our story to the future.

(Touchstone) Mike Wallace fearlessly faces down a burly Hezbollah henchman over seating arrangements at an interview but crumples like an empty soft pack when Big Tobacco blows smoke up his microphone. At least thats how the elder statesman of television journalists comes off in Michael Manns tube-bashing altogether absorbing news drama ""The Insider."" Christopher Plummer deliciously puffed up with self-importance clearly relishes the role of the blustering ""60 Minutes"" regular but Wallace (already irked over how he was portrayed in an earlier version of the script) will be tick-tick-tick-ticked off. And hes sure to have lots of company once colleagues get a look at Manns damning re-creation of the events that led up to CBSs decision to censor a tobacco company expose by the newsmagazine. Inspired by real events the picture centers on Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) the head of research and development at Brown amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. Troubled by what he learns in the companys labs Wigand becomes increasingly vocal and is soon fired for his ""poor communication skills."" To obtain his severance and retain his health benefits hes forced to sign a confidentiality agreement with his bullying bosses. Wigand wrestles with a guilty conscience but might well have gone on to live a comfortably uneventful life had ""60 Minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) not hired him to make sense of some highly technical industry documents. At their clandestine initial meeting Wigand makes it clear to Bergman that hell decipher the documents but that he wont breathe a word of what he knows about Brown amp; Williamson. He does after all have an acquisitive trophy wife and a sick kid to support. Bergman charismatic persuasive indefatigable could talk the Marlboro Man into trying NicoDerm but Wigands venal former bosses do much of the work for the producer when they begin to harass and threaten Wigand and his family. They have woefully underestimated the extent of Wigands rage and mistaken his dour guarded manner for wimpishness when its clear hes about to go postal. Bergman recognizes Wigands distress befriends the troubled soul and with the care of a soldier defusing a bomb talks him into exposing tobaccos dirtiest little secret in an interview with Wallace Cigarettes are routinely treated with chemicals to enhance the nicotines effects. In other words the stuffs addictive and the Burley Boys know it. So does the rest of the world but Mann and co-writer Eric Roth (""Forrest Gump"") dont belabor the point. Theyre much more interested in examining the Draconian tactics of the tobacco barons and what it costs the whistle-blowers of the world to go up against corporate Goliaths. Its the kind of story ""60 Minutes"" tells so well. Wallace quivering with moral outrage and banging on closed doors soldiers on for the little guy. Only in this case nobody comes to the rescue. Wallace and the shows executive producer Don Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall) knuckle under when the network executives insist that they kill the interview lest Brown amp; Williamson slap CBS with a multi-billion-dollar lawsuit. Bergman is shocked and outraged by this affront to the integrity of the Fourth Estate not to mention himself but Wigand who loses his family his face and a small fortune is deprived of the only thing that still matters He wants his two little girls to know why their daddy so disrupted their lives. Bergman who promised to provide Wigand with a bully pulpit for his message responds the only way he can. He takes out a whistle of his own and calls his contacts at the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times. Though the movie deals with the machinations of reporters and is being touted as the best journalism movie since ""All the Presidents Men"" it actually has far more in common with 1979s ""The China Syndrome"" (an executive at a nuclear facility publicizes dangerous practices with the help of a sympathetic TV journalist). And when it comes to scathing indictments of the television industry Mann and company have already been bested by 1976s ""Network."" ""The Insider"" isnt exactly what youd call a scoop. Few viewers will be half as surprised by CBSs humbling retreat as is Bergman a supposedly savvy news hound who has somehow made it to the top without so much as sniffing a corporate weasel. Wigand on the other hand doubts the sanctity of ""60 Minutes"" from the start and has no more faith in Big Medias altruism than Big Tobaccos A corporation is a corporation is a corporation and protecting the shareholders interests is just big business as usual. The good guys are pitted against stereotypically drawn villains--icy lawyers and smug fat cats--but the filmmakers and actors have given their heroes clay fingers and toes and they are all the more fascinating for their flaws. Wigand is a real pill cold and uncommunicative with his wife inclined to temperamental outbursts and appearing to be as motivated by vengeance as moral duty. Crowe the 33-year-old Australian who played the volatile cop in ""L.A. Confidential"" virtually disappears inside the 53-year-old Wigands thick stiff body. Theres no trace of youth or hope in the weariness with which he drinks his Scotch no discernible difference in the way he kisses the wife or pulls on his socks. Yet Crowes minimalist performance gives us clear insight into this opaque being. Pacino at his pop-eyed spittle-flying best supplies energy and a welcome counterpoint to Crowes downcast character. And lets not forget Plummers gleefully snooty take on Wallace whom the writers provide with a mouthful of quotable lines ""I dont plan to spend the last of my days wandering in the wilderness of National Public Radio"" he says of his betrayal of Wigand and Bergman. Wallace who thinks of himself as heir to Edward R. Murrows hard-hitting style is particularly upset when a newspaper editorial denounces the incident as an insult to the memory of Murrow a chain-smoking muckraker who couldnt get through his half-hour show without his tobacco. Smoke gets in his eyes. But Murrow never lost sight of his scruples. Mann who mastered style in his TV series ""Miami Vice"" and previous films like ""Heat"" adds substance to the formula with the intensely dramatic fiercely principled ""Insider."" We all know how to whistle dont we? There just arent that many of us steamed enough (or is it heroic enough?) to blow. The Insider (155 minutes) is rated R for language.

Hes about to sit down in a Middle Eastern hideaway to interview the leader of the Hezbollah and hes pissed off. The sheikhs men are making demands -- demands about how close Wallace can sit during the interview -- and the great white journalist will have none of it. Boldly he throws a tantrum screaming into the face of a burly scowling henchman. The courage The chutzpah Moments later the matter is resolved and the segments producer Lowell Berg-man (Al Pacino) wanders over to ask Wallace if hes properly warmed up. Wallace replies that yes hes gotten his heart started. The entire tantrum you see was a charade a TV-diva exercise in throat clearing. Plummer flaunting a smile that looks like it could out-smarm Liberaces is the juicy quintessence of ham -- smug righteous law-yerly infantile and vain. He seems to be playing Wallace Morley Safer Ed Bradley etc. rolled into one. With exquisite timing the scene makes its point 60 Minutes may be a journalistic enterprise but it is also showbiz. That epiphany however is one that the movie soon forgets. Back in the States Bergman stumbles onto a land mine of a story. He makes contact with an obscure scientist named Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) a dour family man with distressed grayish blond hair who was fired from one of the major tobacco companies. Wigand is sitting on something hes scared to talk about and Bergman a journalist who says that he cares about people (hes described as a former radical who worked for Ramparts) quietly convinces him that its his moral duty to go public with the story. Wigand decides to come clean -- to reveal that tobacco companies chemically enhance the nicotine content of cigarettes upping their addictive properties. Wigand who has already been asked by his former company under duress to sign an Orwellian confidentiality pact now finds his family terrorized by the powers of Big Tobacco. He is trailed by stalkers and death threats appear on his computer screen. Yet he goes on fearful but unfazed convinced that hes doing the right thing.

But director and co-writer Michael Mann has succumbed to the idea that such a big subject needs ""big"" treatment resulting in a borderline pretentious overly inflated picture. Topical subject matter Russell Crowes outstanding performance and plenty of grist for off-showbiz-page media coverage should give Disney more than enough fuel to launch this prestige release to good if limited B.O. results which could conceivably be boosted by critical plaudits and connection to the zeitgeist in the wake of its Nov. 6 release. The story of the unheroic scientific researcher who exposed the tobacco companies official lies about the unhealthful nature of its product leading to legal decisions that for the first time began going against firms in ""the nicotine delivery business"" was a fairly unlikely one for an expensive major studio feature and might have found its ideal form as the sort of tight no-flab corporate thriller at which HBO has come to excel. History has provided Mann with the opportunity for a dual investigation of corporate duplicity courtesy of CBS initial decision not to air its explosive ""60 Minutes"" interview with the whistle-blower which caused deep wounds that the picture will no doubt reopen. The interwoven structure generates tension and creates a larger portrait of the way big business works and relates to those in its ""family."" But the downside to this approach is a measure of sprawl and sag that continually retards the sought-after narrative charge and sense of accumulating anxiety. In a prologue that provides a taste of the power of ""60 Minutes"" and some pure movie razzle-dazzle show producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) gutsily sets up an interview in Iran with an alleged Islamic terrorist that is ultimately conducted by Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). Colorful and amusing episode is intercut with the firing of Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe) from his position as head of research and development at Brown amp; Williamson the third-largest U.S. tobacco company. A devoted family man who must sign a confidentiality agreement in order to receive a settlement and continued benefits the unprepossessing Wigand initially resists Bergmans request to help him decipher some tobacco-related documents. But Wigand has a strong stubborn streak and a sense of whats right that springs out of him at unexpected moments; despite his need to support his wife (Diane Venora) and two school-age daughters he initially tells his former boss (Michael Gambon marvelously malevolent) to shove it when asked to agree to an expanded confidentiality pact only to backtrack later on. But by then the cats out of the bag and Bergman a scarcely reformed radical and Ramparts journalist keeps after the man he knows can blow the lid off the deceptions of ""the seven dwarfs"" the heads of the seven major tobacco companies who with their most sincere poker faces have denied to a congressional committee that smoking poses any health risks. Mann and co-scenarist Eric Roth proceed to describe every movement of every gear in the process that leads Wigand to spill the beans his taking of a teaching job and move to a smaller house; his preliminary ""60 Minutes"" interview in which he directly accuses the tobacco companies of lying; his agreement to the legal ploy of giving a deposition in a Mississippi tobacco case thereby freeing him of the constraints of his confidentiality agreement; the posting of security men in his house in the wake of death threats; and his abandonment by his wife who simply cant take the pressure anymore. Although the relationship between Wigand by nature a private man with a tendency to internalize things and Bergman a demonstrative New Yorker who thrives on confrontation is often testy and on the verge of unraveling Wigand takes the enormous risks he does with the full confidence that Bergman -- and by implication ""60 Minutes"" -- will be there to back him up and make it all worthwhile in the end. That this confidence is misplaced represents the storys biggest shock one that naturally devastates Wigand but ultimately has a more profound impact on Bergman and the reputation of the most respected show on U.S. television. Just as Bergman is pulling together his bombshell broadcast CBS corporate reps (personified by Gina Gershon) quash it due to a legal technicality (one that Bergman suspects is a cover for the threat the controversial segment may pose to a sale of the web to Westinghouse). Bergman naturally assumes that he will have Mike Wallaces support in this battle but when the crusty old pro concedes to the preparation of a watered-down version of the story the darkest hour arrives for Wigand the witness who has been betrayed and Bergman the righteous crusader who has been hung out to dry. But of course it doesnt end there. In the wake of CBS cop-out Bergman must battle against a smear campaign launched against Wigand who goes into a suicidal funk in a hotel room from which he can peer directly into his former employers offices. As the yarn unravels further Wallace realizes his mistake and goes back on the air with the full story. All the same the extensive damage prompts the disenchanted Bergman to lament ""What got broken here doesnt go back together again."" Despite the always interesting behind-the-scenes look at the legwork and politics necessary to produce ""60 Minutes"" the heart of the story here is Wigand and it is upon him that the film should have more squarely concentrated. A man of integrity who can nonetheless be unreliable and short-tempered a thick-bodied fellow who moves with a strangely contradictory quick waddle a nondescript member of the middle class with particular gifts (hes a brilliant scientist and is fluent in Japanese) Wigand snugly fits the description of an ordinary person caught up in extraordinary circumstances. Refusing to make him dashing or attractive in any conventional movie way Crowe topped off with thinning and lightened hair and sporting glasses that he habitually pushes up to the bridge of his nose with his middle finger makes him a fascinating and unpredictable enigma a figure of complicated motives. Pacino invests Bergman with boundless energy and passion for his job but its a one-note character for whom the audience needs no further layering. Bergman spends most of his screen time badgering cajoling and shouting much of it over the phone and its easy to imagine the film scoring nearly all its points with Bergman as a supporting character not as a star part; little is gained by seeing him with his wife (Lindsay Crouse) or so relentlessly pursuing dramatically secondary issues. On the other hand the benefits of less-is-more are readily seen in the case of Plummers Wallace. In his handful of judiciously chosen and sharply written scenes Plummer delivers enormous satisfaction in an authoritative portrait of the celebrated newsman who is gruff shrewd arrogant when he needs to be and always extremely smart -- except for one crucial moment. A host of talented thesps contributes vivid portraits for a large gallery of supporting parts. Mann extended his superb last feature ""Heat"" to the outer limits and got away with it but its not the same here; at 157 minutes pic feels at least 20 minutes too long. As high-powered and inventive as the direction is ""The Insider"" much of which is confined to offices homes and hotels simply doesnt provide much potential for the sort of physical cinema that allows Mann to flex his muscles. Any number of sequences are over-elaborated in an attempt to pump them up visually which has the cumulative effect of attaching unnecessary weight to a story that is already sufficiently interesting. Despite the limited scenic opportunities of Middle America and the mundane interiors pic has the customary flair associated with Mann and lenser Dante Spinotti. Musical choices which include numerous exotic foreign-sounding themes are odd with some working and others not.

"Insider The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; insider-the ) Insider The (United States 1999) A movie review by James Berardinelli It has been four years since the events depicted in Michael Manns The Insider occurred. Actually to be precise it has been four years since some of them occurred. In the interests of drama a certain amount of ""fictionalization"" has taken place. The incidents related here represent CBS News blackest hour - a time when greed and bad judgment overcame journalistic integrity. A story for 60 Minutes compiled by correspondent Mike Wallace (played in the film by Christopher Plummer) and producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) was killed when a potential lawsuit by tobacco giant Brown amp; Williamson threatened a buyout of CBS that would make a number of high-placed corporate executives very rich. The story an interview with Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) a fired Bamp;W corporate V.P. who had decided to blow the whistle on his former boss lies to congress created such a behind-the-scenes furor at the newsmagazine that the segment was ordered shelved. When The New York Times printed an exposA(c) about what had happened CBS News had egg on its face and was forced to re-consider the decision. Wigand was removed from the Bamp;W payroll in March 1993 because in his words ""When I get angry I have difficulty censoring myself and I dont like being pushed around."" As a scientist Wigand was deeply disturbed by the results of a study he ran which showed that cigarettes are nothing more than ""a delivery device for nicotine"" and that the tobacco companies deliberately manipulate the levels of the drug in their product to promote addiction. He first met Bergman when the 60 Minutes producer was looking for an expert to translate industry-specific technical jargon. As the two spent time together Bergman realized that Wigand knew an explosive secret but was constrained from talking by a confidentiality agreement he had signed upon leaving Bamp;W (the terms of which guaranteed his severance pay and continued medical coverage). Bergman believing he knew a way around a breach of contract offered Wigand the opportunity to be subpoenaed to testify in a Mississippi wrongful death class action lawsuit against the tobacco companies. Once his testimony was a part of the public record he could go on 60 Minutes to state his case. Even before Wigand agreed he and his family became the targets of terroristic threats from anonymous sources. Eventually Wigands day to give a deposition arrived but after risking everything (including his marriage and the possibility of going to jail) he learned that 60 Minutes had decided to cut the interview rendering his sacrifices moot. Wigand had been betrayed Bergman had been hung out to dry and the Court of Public Opinion would not hear the truth about the tobacco giants. The Insider is like a play in two acts. The first half of the film centers on Wigand - his struggles with his conscience his conflict with his former employers his difficulty convincing his wife to understand and accept the sacrifices she was being forced to make and his decision to damn the consequences and go forward. During this part of the movie Bergman is clearly a supporting character. At just past the midway point this changes with Bergman moving into the spotlight and Wigand fading into the background. Bergman becomes Wigands crusader - a fireball of righteous indignation screaming about violations of trust and journalistic integrity. Dividing the film in this manner results in a second half that feels fractionally off-center. Certainly theres a great deal of intensity (and Pacinos not the only one to supply it - both Bruce McGill and Christopher Plummer have powerhouse scenes) but the shift of the focus from Wigand to Bergman leaves a small vacuum that all of the great 60 Minutes behind-the-scenes machinations cant completely fill. During the films first 80 minutes when Wigand is in nearly every scene Mann fashions a connection between the character and the audience. When Bergman later takes center stage and Wigand is relegated to the wings The Insiders emotional core becomes blurred. We never feel for Bergman the way we do for Wigand who has more on the line. The Insider is arguably a little too long with a few too many minor subplots thrown in (such as one about the Unibomber). However when the movie is on-target which is most of the time it is riveting. Mann generates tension without resorting to the boring stand-bys of shootouts and chase scenes. The actors play their roles as if theres something tangible on the line and those performances heighten the level of suspense. The camerawork by veteran cinematographer Dante Spinotti uses frequent hand-held shots to help establish an edgy uncertain tone. On one hand the movie is about the corruption of a National Institution - how 60 Minutes the paragon of newsworthiness was pressured by financial considerations to cut a story. On the other hand The Insider is about Wigands courage - how the man took a stand and was betrayed by the people he expected to protect him. Those are the two faces of the movies powerful and compelling drama and both are handled expertly. Pacino is at his intense best. This isnt a new kind of role for him - hes basically resurrecting Arthur Kirkland from ...And Justice for All - but the familiarity of the part doesnt limit his effectiveness. Russell Crowe who typically plays a young vital character essays a weary man who is prematurely aging under the burden of integrity. With thinning white hair and spectacles Crowe looks far less imposing than he did in his most recent film Mystery Alaska or in his U.S. breakthrough L.A. Confidential. He presents Wigand as a nervous uncommunicative character who gives his testimony almost timidly but can be driven to brief passionate outbursts. He and Pacino complement each other well. Physically Christopher Plummer bears only a passing resemblance to Mike Wallace but the veteran actor manages a credibly mimicry of the newsmans mannerisms and vocal patterns. Plummer plays Wallace somewhat unsympathetically. He is shown to be afflicted with a large ego and is opportunistic yet in the end he clearly views the phrase ""journalistic integrity"" as more than a buzzword. Plummer has a single standout scene - Wallace goes into a towering rage after some of his on-air comments have been excised from a broadcast. (""You think you can edit me?"") Other credible supporting performances are given by Diane Verona (as Wigands wife) Bruce McGill (who has a small but powerful part as an attorney in the tobacco suit) and Colm Feore (as another lawyer). Unlike Manns previous outing Heat where the first on-screen meeting between Pacino and Robert DeNiro overshadowed everything and gave the proceedings a ponderous portentous air The Insider remains well grounded. To be sure the film tackles some big issues but Mann never permits any of these ""shock"" revelations (which really arent all that shocking) to eclipse the fact that the characters not the concepts hold our interest; everything else is of secondary importance. The result is a compelling and engaging motion picture that weds the tautness of a thriller with the depth and impact of a drama.

Starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Directed by Michael Mann. (R. 160 minutes.) ""The Insider"" is a truth- based drama about the former tobacco industry scientist who blew the whistle on his bosses. Its about how ""60 Minutes"" had the story but caved in to pressure not to run it. Russell Crowe plays Jeffrey Wigand the insider as a distant character with a hair-trigger temper. That capacity for anger plus an ingrained sense of right and wrong gets Wigand fired from his 300000-a-year research job at Brown amp; Williamson tobacco. It also leads him to tell his story to ""60 Minutes"" -- with the encouragement of the shows segment producer Lowell Bergman. In the early encounters between Wigand and Bergman played by Al Pacino one can almost feel the reporters excitement at having such a big fish on the line. Wigand knows that his company made its cigarettes more addictive. In ""The Insider"" if America is not a country completely run by monied interests it is close. ""60 Minutes"" is about to air its interview with Wigand when CBS higher-ups make it pull back. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace emerges as a sympathetic character but one with clay feet. He is a tough guy on easy targets but when the opponent is powerful his tent folds. We come away seeing him as more entertainer than journalist. ..

(Touchstone) It has been a long time since weve had an enjoyable paranoid thriller in the tradition of such 1970s movies as ""The Parallax View"" and ""All the Presidents Men."" The key ingredient in those movies a sort of refreshingly naive surprise that society is controlled by secret star chambers whose evil work is too subtle or concealed to be detected and who have the organizational might to terminate any whistle-blowers foolish enough to take them on. This is good stuff. ""The Insider"" a fictionally reordered accounting of the three-way battle that included the TV news show ""60 Minutes"" the CBS network and the tobacco industry hits that hungry spot. Michael Manns thriller starring Al Pacino (as producer Lowell Bergman) Russell Crowe (as tobacco company whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand) and Christopher Plummer (Mike Wallace) is a well-orchestrated nightmare that keeps you on edge until the very end. The facts based on Marie Brenners Vanity Fair article ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" are these Wigand who was a central witness in lawsuits filed against the tobacco industry by Mississippi and 49 other states spoke with the ""60 Minutes"" team against the desire of his former employers. Hounded by death threats and a smear campaign for speaking out he was shocked to learn that the TV show would not air his interview because of pressure from CBS. The network seeking to avoid litigation asked ""60 Minutes"" to do a different version of the news piece sans Wigand. This prompted in-house squabbling between producer Don Hewitt and Mike Wallace (both of whom agreed to air the non-Wigand version) and Bergman who fought the idea vigorously. The movie which Mann wrote with Eric (""Forrest Gump"") Roth follows this story closely but adds the appropriate atmospherics. By Hollywoods limbo-pole standards ""The Insider"" is a well-executed thriller which examines the shifting interface between high-minded principle and job security between corporate agenda and moral code. Under Manns direction the movie becomes a man-to-man contentious friendship between Pacinos Bergman and Crowes Wigand echoing a similar relationship between Pacino and Robert De Niro in Manns ""Heat."" Although Crowes portrayal of Wigand is ""warts and all"" Brenners article paints a more damning picture of Wigands irascible behavioral marital and drinking problems. Conversely Plummers Wallace shows a newsman a little too enamored of his legendary status whose professional integrity is only as strong as his desire for job security. How close is this to the truth? The real Wallace has publicly expressed his displeasure with the movies depiction of events particularly concerning the circumstances that led to his capitulation to CBS. Is ""The Insider"" a hagiography of CBS News producer Bergman at the cost of his colleague Wallace and CBS management? How far from the truth does the movie wander? Suffice it to say theres a patina of truth here enough for a good night at the movies. ""I dont burn people"" Bergman tells Wigand who fears that the ""60 Minutes"" producer will betray him. We dont know until the end whether Bergman will honor his word. But as we wait to find out we are moviegoers not Beltway pundits. What were dealing with here is sheer drama the waning trust between two men forced together under extraordinary circumstances. Were also appreciating strong performances. As a tubby increasingly paranoid (but with good reason) company man who becomes a dangerous catalyst in one of the nations most pressing public health matters Crowe is fantastic to watch. Pacino lends the right balance of heroic and antiheroic qualities as Bergman to keep us rooting for him to the last. And whether Plummers on the mark or not his interpretation - like this movie - has a powerful ring of believability. THE INSIDER (R 158 minutes) Contains obscenity and emotional intensity.
