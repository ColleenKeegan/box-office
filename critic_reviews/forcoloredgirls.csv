By Peter Rainer Film critic November 12 2010 Save for later Saved Kimberly Elise plays Crystal in Tyler Perrys acrid adaptation of For Colored Girls. Quantrelle Colbert/Lionsgate           View Caption About video ads View Caption of Tyler Perry the most commercially successful African-American filmmaker (""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"" ""Madea Goes to Jail"") has been criticized mostly by white critics for promoting howlingly over-the-top racial stereotypes.For his new film he has improbably adapted Ntozake Shanges 1975 stage show ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf"" - shortened here into the more marquee-friendly ""For Colored Girls.""Like ""Precious"" it centers on the rage and sorrows of black women and also like that film its a lumpy gumbo of high drama and low melodrama. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Shanges play a feminist anthem is a series of linked monologues featuring seven African-American dancers each identified only by the color of her garb. In the movie Perry who adapted the play in addition to directing provides an overarching narrative to link the women who with one exception now all occupy a Harlem tenement. Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The connective material isnt nearly as ""poetic"" as the Shange monologues that periodically interpose. Perry makes no effort to disguise the poetics. He treats them in the same manner as a movie-musical character suddenly breaking into song. Its not an entirely satisfactory approach but Im not sure how else he could have made a movie out of this play and retained anything of Shanges flavor.That flavor is most often acrid brackish and bitter not surprising since the film is focused on heartbreak rape disease religious fanaticism infertility and incest - for starters. Perry has assembled a formidable ensemble including Loretta Devine Kimberly Elise Thandie Newton Anika Noni Rose Tessa Thompson Kerry Washington Whoopi Goldberg Janet Jackson Phylicia Rashad and in the most searing cameo Macy Gray as a strung-out abortionist.The men in this world played by among others Michael Ealy Omari Hardwick Khalil Kain and Hill Harper are almost uniformly untrustworthy or despicable or both. The women almost uniformly are sanctified by their rage - their victimhood.As skewed and prejudicial as this is I dont have a big problem with it Plenty of male-dominated movies are female-phobic so the payback here seems understandable if not altogether justified. Shange to her credit doesnt temper her rage in the service of political correctness. Its just that she overcorrected. ""For Colored Girls"" is a long wallow in misery and after a while the pain morphs into polemic.

By David Edelstein Published Nov 7 2010 ShareThis (Photo Courtesy of Lionsgate) In Precious the African-American lesbian couple who give the heroine a glimpse of domestic happiness have a poster for Ntozake Shanges choreopoem For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf. It was such a cliched accessory that I rolled my eyes but Tyler Perrywho lent his name to Precious as an executive producermust have licked his lips. He has taken Shanges landmark poem cycle for seven African-American actresses cut it up and sewn its bloody entrails into a tawdry masochistic soap opera that exponentially ups the Precious ante. For Colored Girls is so shamelessly terrible it would make a great midnight hoot-fest if you had the stomach to laugh at Shange or some of the best (and most underused) actresses of their generation Kimberly Elise Kerry Washington Anika Noni Rose Phylicia Rashad and as a cartoon sexpot Thandie Newton who gets by on her killer timing. At various mundane junctures each woman begins to speak high-flown verse while other characters gaze on like extras in Oklahoma They are all victimized by menfigures left abstract onstage but here embodied by one stereotypical dog after another. The women are plenty stereotyped too with Janet Jackson getting the worst of it as an Anna Wintourlike magazine diva who doesnt know that her assistant (Elise) is being abused by an alcoholic Iraq-vet husband. The most ludicrous sequence is a rape thats crosscut with an abortion (by a chain-smoking vodka-swilling back-alley abortionist) and a scene at the opera in which Jackson realizes her husband is gay. Grand opera what a touch. The cameras are shoved in the actresses faces to catch their inevitable teardrops which for Tyler are his climaxesthe money shots. For Colored Girls Lionsgate.

And its hard not to applaud his determination and grade for ambition. Perrys adaptation of Ntozake Shanges shattering 1975 theater piece ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" is loaded with potent powerfully acted moments worth the price of the ticket. The ensemble piece includes beautiful turns by Phylicia Rashad as a nosy apartment building manager Anika Noni Rose as a dance instructor and Kimberly Elise as a capable office assistant whose war-veteran husband suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. ""For Colored Girls"" also has more than a few blemishes. Macy Gray is cast as a back-alley abortionist. And as Alice a religious zealot and oppressive mother Whoopi Goldberg has never been so out of her depth. Perry is known for comic dramas about black women surviving that feature a rough-and-tumble gun- toting aunt named Madea (played by Perry in outlandish drag). ""For Colored Girls"" is a somber departure. Author Shange has called her fiercely wrought work a ""choreo- poem."" It consists of more than 20 poems performed by seven characters identified by a prism of colors ""lady in orange"" ""lady in blue"" ""lady in yellow"" etc. They hail from different parts of the U.S. but share on stage their overlapping stories about neglect abuse rape. Perry has added two new protagonists to the cast -- Janet Jacksons magazine editor Jo and Goldbergs nutjob -- given them all names and situated most of the films action in Harlem. Initially few of the women know one another. Crystal (Elise) works for Jo. Jackson channels Prada-clad devil Miranda Priestly but without a smidge of humanity. One story line touches on black gay men living straight lives or living on the ""down low."" Crystal lives with her two beautiful children and disturbed husband (Michael Ealy in a anguished turn) on the same floor of a walk-up as Gilda (Rashad) and Tangie (Thandie Newton). Kerry Washington plays child-welfare caseworker Kelly whos married to a detective. All cross paths when tragedy draws them together. If I dont mention the casts menfolk its because as gloriously handsome as they are with the exception of actor Hill Harpers police detective they are inglorious bastards. Like most of Perrys films ""For Colored Girls"" invites audiences to ponder not just the meaning of the film but the cultural significance of the filmmaker himself. Last month the movie mogul appeared on Oprah Winfreys show to share a history of being abused -- both physically and sexually. Hes a survivor of violence and betrayal at the hands of his father but also other black men. Might this explain his attraction to a brilliant play that nevertheless has little to offer black males looking for their own liberating tale? Of course whoever undertook the challenges of bringing Shanges tour de force to the big screen had his or her work cut out. Bless Perry for weaving Shanges rich words into his characters dialog. As the dance teacher Yasmine Rose delivers an incandescent and pained monologue about date rape. And Loretta Devine who plays Juanita a nurse who runs a womens clinic but cant find a trustworthy love has rare fun with a sharp poem. ""Somone almost walked off wid alla my stuff"" she says with huff and awareness. ""FOR COLORED GIRLS."" R for some disturbing violence including a rape sexual content and language. 2 hours 14 minutes. Written and directed by Tyler Perry; from the choreopoem ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicice/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" by Ntozake Shange; photography by Alexander Gruszynski; starring Janet Jackson Loretta Devine Michael Ealy Kimberly Elise Omari Hardwick Hill Harper Thandie Newton Phylicia Rashad Anika Noni Rose Tessa Thompson Kerry Washington Whoopi Goldberg Macy Gray Khalil Kain and Richard Lawson.

"For Colored Girls review Directors prosaic style sinks poetry of colored girls |       NJ.com comments For Colored Girls review Directors prosaic style sinks poetry of colored girls Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 05 2010 at 816 AM View/Post Comments AP Photo/Lionsgate Quantrell ColbertThandie Newton is a sarcastic self-loathing bartender and Whoopi Goldberg is her abusive mother in ""For Colored Girls."" Often the director you want to make a film is not the director who can get the film made. Martin Scorsese was once interested in doing ""Schindlers List."" Billy Wilder took a pass at it too. But it was only Steven Spielberg -- then Hollywoods feel-good filmmaker -- who had the power to get it going. And he rose to the occasion. Similarly there are other directors you might have wanted to see adapting the play ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf."" Maybe Kasi Lemmons who made the haunting ""Eves Bayou."" Or Spike Lee who would at least embrace the materials deliberate theatricality. But Lemmons and Lee dont have real power in Hollywood. Tyler Perry does. Movie Review For Colored Girls (R) Lionsgate (125 min.) Directed by Tyler Perry. With Kimberly Elise Thandie Newton Loretta Devine. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains scenes of child abuse and sexual violence sexual situations brief nudity strong language and substance abuse. Stephen Whittys review TWO STARS And Perry has not risen to the occasion here. Admittedly it was a difficult assignment. Ntozake Shanges ""choreopoem"" is a literally poetic thematically impressionistic cry from the heart detailing the resilience of urban black women in the face of violence -- much of it in their own homes. First performed in bars and coffeehouses it flouted every convention -- from its appropriation of demeaning phrases like ""colored girls"" to its deliberate street-poetry use of language. It was a radical redefinition of acceptable theater. It needed a similarly radical filmmaker. Instead it got Perry who cant decide between reverence and rewrites. So yes every so often things slow down long enough for one of the many fine actresses here to deliver some of Shanges incantatory free verse. But those moments are separated by Perrys own writing full of obvious dialogue and simplified characters. Its like a handful of sparkling jewels mounted in a clumsy costume-jewelry necklace. Give Perry credit -- he doesnt find a way to drag in Madea. But he cant resist his own beloved (and reactionary) cliches where every bad woman is a sleek cold success who drives away men and every good woman is old oversized and struggling. Still Shanges poetry survives in patches and not surprisingly Perry has found some wonderful actresses to declaim it. True I never believed Janet Jacksons freezing fashion editor; hard as Jackson works her performance seems like outtakes from ""Ugly Betty."" But Phylicia Rashad and Loretta Devine play two different incarnations of Perrys favorite heroine the truth-talking earth mother and do it with fire and steel. LionsGate From left Kerry Washington Phylicia Rashad and Anika Noni Rose in director Tyler Perrys ""For Colored Girls."" Also given some fine moments is the terrific Kimberly Elise as a woman in an abusive relationship. And Thandie Newton owns the film as Tangie a sarcastic bartender whose liberated sex life springs from her own self-loathing (as in the simpler world of Tyler Perry it must). They are just a few of the great underused black actresses who make up this films rainbow. But the irony remains that the one filmmaker able to get this film made didnt know how to make it. Perry gets points for persistence yes and for ambition. But thats not enuf.

Tyler Perrys ninth film as a writer-director ""For Colored Girls"" represents something of an improvement over his last opus screened for critics 2006s ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman."" And not just because the cross-dressing auteurs signature character the raving granny Madea is mercifully absent. Perry is adapting someone elses work for once Ntozake Shanges landmark ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" a 1974 ""choreo-poem"" about the woes in black womens lives that has been frequently performed on stage since winning Obie and Tony awards. Shanges words retain their power despite the melodramatic incidents Perry has woven to fill in the spaces between poems his flat TV-style direction and the highly variable performances of an all-star cast. Their stories crisscross until almost all of them meet for a literal group hug that could almost have doubled as the films wrap party. Kimberly Elise whose fine performance in ""Mad Black Woman"" was upstaged by Madeas antics has the only fully developed character -- Crystal the abused girlfriend of an alcoholic war veteran (Michael Ealy) who also poses a clear and present danger to their two young children. Crystal lives in a Harlem apartment building with several of the other women including a promiscuous bartender (Thandie Newton) with a younger sister (Tessa Thompson). The latter is a dancer who loses her virginity and is forced to seek the services of an abortionist (though the story is ostensibly set in the present) scarily played by Macy Gray. A scenery-chewing Whoopi Goldberg goes way over the top as the sisters religious fanatic mother. Even worse is the campy Janet Jackson as Crystals boss an icy magazine editor whose hunky hubby (Omari Hardwick) is sleeping with men on the down low -- because its implied shes so emasculating. Somewhere in the middle are Phylicia Rashad as the buildings manager and resident Greek chorus Loretta Devine as a bubbly relationship counselor with an on/off lover Anika Noni Rose as a date-raped dance instructor and Kerry Washington as a child welfare worker with fertility problems. ""For Colored Girls"" begs the inevitable comparison with ""Precious"" a vastly superior Harlem-set tale of misery that Perry and his sister-in-victimhood Oprah Winfrey attached their names to. ""Precious"" worked partly because it did not wrap its sordid tale in Christian uplift and dime-store psychology -- elements that have made Tyler Perry a rich filmmaker but have turned ""For Colored Girls"" shrill and manipulative.

Starring Janet Jackson Loretta Devine Michael Ealy Kimberly Elise Omari Hardwick Hill Harper Thandie Newton Phylicia Rashad Anika Noni Rose Tessa Thompson Director Tyler Perry Running time 200 Release Opened Nov 5 2010  Editorial Review More than enuf man-bashingBy Michael OSullivanFriday November 5 2010Who exactly is ""For Colored Girls"" for? Its hard to imagine that any self-respecting man would want to sit through two hours - let alone two minutes - of such caustic man-bashing. With the exception of a single minor character the men in Tyler Perrys adaptation of Ntozake Shanges stage play ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" include a rapist (Khalil Kain) a child murderer/wife beater (Michael Ealy) a serial cheater (Richard Lawson) and a closeted gay man who has been dipping into his wifes bank account without permission (Omari Hardwick). And thats not even counting the minor jerks and misogynists who populate the fringes of this dated relic of the womens empowerment movement written in 1975 as a series of free-verse monologues with dance but rewritten by Perry to fit a more traditional narrative structure. All told it paints a bleak picture of masculinity as the domain of liars and thieves paranoid alcoholics unemployed moochers adulterers batterers sex addicts and pedophiles. So its a womans film then? That at least is the obvious assumption. At first glance ""For Colored Girls"" seems aimed squarely at the audience for what a friend calls the ""woman good man bad"" melodramas that are the staple of the Lifetime cable network. But even by those sour standards its a long hard slog. Rather than portraying strong successful women overcoming adversity the film presents its central female characters primarily as helpless victims and dupes or worse yet harpies. Janet Jacksons Jo may have been betrayed by a husband on the down-low but shes also a singularly unpleasant shrew. Her fashion-magazine editor is cut from the same abrasive cloth as Meryl Streeps Miranda from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" but without the comedy. Thandie Newtons Tangie is a foul-mouthed and even more foul-tempered tramp; her pregnant teenage sister Nyla (Tessa Thompson) is the victim of a back-alley abortionist (Macy Gray). Its no wonder Their mother (Whoopi Goldberg) is an emotionally withholding religious fanatic. For her part Kimberly Elise does a great impersonation of a doormat sticking by her man through beatings fits of jealousy and worse. There are of course a few quasi-heroic women but even they have tribulations. Social worker Kerry Washington is coping with infertility. Nurse Loretta Devine keeps getting screwed over by the same philandering lout. And apartment manager Phylicia Rashad though a pillar of emotional strength and decency is alone in the world. Then theres the dancer Yasmine (Anika Noni Rose). Perry shoots her date rape in such lurid histrionic fashion that it goes beyond tragedy eliciting titters of uncomfortable - not to mention wildly inappropriate - laughter at a screening as did other scenes of near-Shakespearean wailing and gnashing of teeth. Its such an unrelentingly downer ""For Colored Girls"" makes ""Precious"" (which Perry produced but did not direct) look like ""Pollyanna."" Making matters worse the language of Shanges original ""choreopoem"" hasnt aged well. Whenever one of the women breaks out of Tylers naturalistic dialogue into Shanges jazzy I-am-woman-hear-me-roar lingo the storys connection to the real world is severed utterly. It feels corny recycled and hopelessly artificial. As vitally important as the feminist movement of the 1970s was - and still is - havent we outgrown its cheesy stylistic affectations? The film is not however without its bright spots. Given the at-times-ridiculous poetry the cast must utter - ""My love is too Saturday night to have thrown back on my face"" - the actresses all acquit themselves well enough. That includes Jackson whose surgically enhanced face though largely frozen suits her imperious character. ""For Colored Girls"" may in fact be Perrys best film (not saying a lot I know). Its certainly his first bid as a director for art-house respectability. The real question however isnt whether the movie is any good. Its why - and for what theoretical audience - did he he make it?Contains violence obscenity sensuality drug use partial nudity and smoking.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 05 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Nov. 04 2010 402PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English WHAT IS IT? Ntozake Shanges 1975 play For Colored Girls Who Have Contemplated Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf is a collection of 20 prose poems with dance and music performed by a cast of seven women identified only by the colours of their dresses on a spare stage. Shanges play focuses on trials and triumphs of varied black womens lives including domestic abuse rape and abortion as well as the pleasures of friendship sex music poetry and dance. The winner of an Obie Award and a Tony nominee it has also been produced for television and in numerous stage versions including an Appalachian one with a white cast. Now here is the film adapted for the screen by Tyler Perry. Perry who has made nine films since 2005 is an entertainment powerhouse rated by Forbes as the sixth-most-powerful man in Hollywood. He has the clout to get For Colored Girls made but his name also rouses doubts. Shanges play was about revealing authentic black womens voices. Perrys forte is melodrama mixed with slapstick in a series of plays adapted into films starring himself in drag as the wise and sassy grandmother Madea. Madea doesnt appear in For Colored Girls. Maybe she could have helped. HOW DOES IT WORK? It doesnt. The film is a mawkish mess only occasionally alleviated by the performances or Shanges poetry. Perrys script arranges for most of his characters to find their way to one Harlem walk-up where the ugliest in an orgy of third-act tragedies takes place. The other place where most of the characters end up is in the hospital. The actresses include a one-note Kimberly Elise as an abused common-law wife and mother of young children; a stiffly unconvincing Janet Jackson as a diva magazine editor with a husband on the down low (The Devil Wears Prada-inspired plot is Perrys invention); a breathy Loretta Devine as a community nurse who is a fool for love; a too-good-for-this Anika Noni Rose as a dance instructor who learns that Mr. Right is the opposite; a really-too-good-for-this Kerry Washington as a child-welfare worker who cant have children; an underwritten Phylicia Rashad as the all-seeing apartment manager; a miscast Thandie Newton as a cynical promiscuous bartender; Tessa Thompson as her sweet younger sister who gets both the virginity-losing and abortion monologues; Whoopi Goldberg in an embarrassing performance as their religious fundamentalist mother. The highlight singer Macy Grays creepy hypnotic monologue as a back-alley abortionist. DOES IT MATTER? Yes in a negative sense. In a year when there have been predictions about a probable ""all-white"" Oscars again the dearth of good scripts for actors of colour is a dilemma. Though African-American stars (Samuel L. Jackson Morgan Freeman and Zoe Saldana) have been in some of the top-grossing blockbusters of all time they are not currently doing roles that earn awards and confer artistic credibility. A Broadway adaptation from a literary writer with a black cast is a rare opportunity. This production represents a missed chance for actresses of the calibre of Anika Noni Rose and Kerry Washington. For Perry his most ambitious film to date exposes his limitations as a director and an uncanny instinct for the grotesquely inappropriate A cutaway to dinner burning on the stovetop during a rape scene suggests an homage to Precious which Perry helped to produce. In another scene Janet Jacksons character drives to her assistants apartment where she sees a man dangling his children out of the window. Yes the incident is described in Shanges play but putting Jackson in the scene was Perrys idea. Instead of evoking terror it feels like the worst tribute ever to the memory of Michael Jackson.

Photo Quantrell Colbert AP For Colored Girls review Poetry in emotion 1 / 3 Back to Gallery For Colored Girls Drama. Starring Kerry Washington Janet Jackson Anika Noni Rose Kimberly Elise Loretta Devine and Thandie Newton. Directed by Tyler Perry. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""For Colored Girls"" is a serious achievement. It takes the 1975 play by Ntozake Shange which consisted entirely of poetry and transforms it into a heartfelt narrative feature about a handful of black women in various walks of life facing a crisis. The dialogue consists mainly of normal spoken conversation but then in moments of acute emotion the dialogue shifts into Shanges poetry and the women open up their souls with brutal eloquence. The effect is like watching an opera without music. Or a musical drama in which no one sings. These departures from a realistic convention never feel like static set pieces - thats the great success of the film and of the poems themselves which are too strong and too inherently dramatic to slow things down. They have their own energy building and arriving and deepening as they go on. As such these poetic interludes become privileged moments of contact where you get to look right into someone and hear her truest voice. Like a long close-up in a Bergman movie the effect is intimate and profound and it satisfies a couple of basic audience yearnings - to experience life at its most intense and to come away with some kind of clue as to what its like to be someone else. Tyler Perry the cross-dressing comedian-filmmaker best known for his ""Madea"" movies adapted and directed ""For Colored Girls"" and its a real departure. That Perry is funny and skilled has never been a secret. But this new film shows a mastery of tone a capacity to elicit strong performances and also to bring out different colors within those performances so that when it all comes together its not the same note sounding over and over. This is smart lovely work. The characters are loosely related and all going through hell which means that everyone has big emotions to play. Thandie Newton is Tangie who uses promiscuity as a drug to ward off pain. She lives next door in an old apartment building to Phylicia Rashad as Gilda a combination busybody/wise woman and across the hall from Crystal - played by the remarkable Kimberly Elise - who has the biggest cross to bear. Her lover a veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress and alcoholism is a danger to her and her two kids. Most of the dilemmas that the women confront might be faced by women of any race or color. Janet Jackson with the authority of someone who knows how to give orders plays a business executive whose boyfriend keeps staring at men on the street. Anika Noni Rose is Yasmine a radiant confident woman who turns out to be too trusting. Loretta Devine is a social worker coping with loneliness and a go-nowhere romance. The men in ""For Colored Girls"" even when theyre benign are infantile and some are infinitely worse. Yet even as it transcends the African American experience ""For Colored Girls"" communicates something specific and valuable about being black in America. Tammy Wynette said ""Sometimes its hard to be a woman."" ""For Colored Girls"" is saying ""Sometimes its even harder to be a black woman."" Id prefer to think its more a product of the plays original period (the 1970s) than an ongoing condition but the women here convey a sense of being very much on their own left to fend for themselves with neither help nor hope of ever really being understood. Its as if theyre all under some extra measure of pressure. This pressure can manifest in all kinds of ways including religious fanaticism - Whoopi Goldberg is excellent (and entirely not funny) as a white-robed member of a bizarre cult religion. The beauty of ""For Colored Girls"" is that characters who fear never being understood get to speak and express themselves with crystalline grace. And so somehow what might have been a sad story feels exalted. -- Advisory This film contains violence against women violence against children drug use sexual situations and strong language.

"Somebody took all their stuff | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesSomebody took all their stuffTyler Perrys take on Ntozake Shanges 1970s play about black female enlightenment gets the medium right but not the message.Janet Jackson plays the rainbow character Jo (Red) in For Colored Girls.  (QUANTRELL COLBERT / LIONSGATE)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 4 2010For Colored Girls (out of 4)Starring Thandie Newton Janet Jackson Whoopi Goldberg Phylicia Rashad Anika Noni Rose Loretta Devine Kimberly Elise and Kerry Washington. Directed by Tyler Perry. At Scotiabank and Silver City Yorkdale theatres. 134 minutes. STC""Being coloured is a metaphysical dilemma"" a character says in For Colored Girls and the thought follows that maybe Tyler Perry got this difficult stage-to-screen adaptation half right.The writer/director behind the exceedingly broad comedy of the Madea franchise approaches the hit 1970s Ntozake Shange play with a pragmatism that succeeds in form but not in function. Article Continued BelowA playwright himself Perry has solved the metaphysical dilemma of what to do with a unique performance piece originally titled For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf that debuted in 1974 in a California coffee house.The play was 20 narrative poems (a collective ""choreopoem"") declaimed by seven actresses each of them assigned a rainbow colour (it was the Seventies after all). Observations and agitations were made about abortion infidelity promiscuity date rape and self identity.This wouldnt work in a movie -- not a mainstream one at any rate -- so admirer Perry sensibly provides the structure of a Harlem tenement house which is presided over by watchful new character Gilda (Phylicia Rashad superb). Flowing into and around this building are those seven rainbow characters played by a strong cast Thandie Newton (Tangie/Orange); Janet Jackson (Jo/Red); Whoopi Goldberg (Alice/White); Anika Noni Rose (Yasmine/Yellow); Loretta Devine (Juanita/Green); Kimberly Elise (Crystal/Brown) and Kerry Washington (Kelly/Blue).Perry adds a few more characters notably male ones and he handles the plays poetry like the slams of the 1990s allowing figures to simply throw down rhymes as the mood strikes and the narrative allows.So far so smart and we can forgive the outdated ""coloured"" reference on the grounds of historical accuracy.But Perrys house comes tumbling down when the winds of misguided political correctness blow through. His vision of black women -- and remember that he plays one in his Madea role -- is almost entirely negative. As Marshall McLuhan might have observed Perry gets the medium right but not the message.To be black and female in For Colored Girls is to be a victim of unending misery and the cause of that misery is invariably black males. One unhappy lady is promiscuous because her daddy abused her and her lovers arent much better. Another is threatened by her psychotic ex-soldier boyfriend and so are her children. An unwanted pregnancy (and botched abortion) threatens the life of one woman; anothers cheating husband results in a terrifying doctors report. And so it goes.In his obviously sincere desire to identify with and support black women Perry neglects the equally urgent need to celebrate them and their achievements. A hokey ""Kumbaya""-style gathering on a rooftop doesnt cut it.Is it really necessary to depict black men in such uniformly awful terms? In Perrys skewed view theyre all cheaters rapists murderers and general losers and even the dead dont escape his wrath. One woman blames her lousy mothering skills on the lack of a proper inheritance from her late grandfather. The one remotely decent guy in the film is insinuated to be lacking in something because he cant get his woman pregnant. Shanges play was never this downbeat. By the time Devines social worker character Juanita wails the famous line ""Somebody took all my stuff"" you begin to think the same about what Perry did to Shange.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

(Lionsgate) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday November 4 2010 432 PM Title For Colored Girls Nine women bond over shared tragedies. With Janet Jackson Kerry Washington. Director Tyler Perry (159). R Violence sexuality language. At area theaters.""This is a womans trip"" it is announced in Tyler Perrys ""For Colored Girls"" and how you respond to those words will likely determine how you respond to the film itself.Perry has built a contemporary narrative around the poems in Ntozake Shanges now-classic 1974 theater piece ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf.""Fans of the original may be dismayed by his often-awkward adaptation which turns too many of Shanges survivors into victims. But its equally likely that his blunt emotional approach -- using her words to create his own melodrama -- will connect with a new audience.Audiences will recognize many themes (and actors) from Perrys other works. ""Diary of a Mad Black Womans"" Kimberly Elise is Crystal a mother desperate to protect her children from their alcoholic father (Michael Ealy). Loretta Devine and Kerry Washington are the social workers hoping to help her while Janet Jackson is her successful unhappy boss.Thandie Newton and Tessa Thompson play her neighbors sisters bound by the madness of their mother (Whoopi Goldberg). And Phylicia Rashads apartment manager watches it all unfold in their Harlem building.Rarely does so much talent and beauty collect in one place and Perry takes full advantage. Granted the original material often feels stagy and Perrys script is far from subtle. But all the actresses including Anika Noni Rose as a naive dancer make an impact with veterans Rashad and Devine leading the way.These characters grapple with dark stuff and Perry enthusiastically sharpens the edges. There are times in fact when the movie threatens to become a litany of unrelenting tragedy rape incest illness abortion abuse and deepest heartbreak.That wasnt Shanges aim. But Perry seems intent on acknowledging that these are still real issues faced by real viewers every day.And when was the last time you saw a film built entirely around so many women of color -- or so many women at all?Some will accuse him of pandering but as his popularity attests others watch his films and feel heard.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Their stories are two of nine woven together in an adaptation of the 1974 play. ABOUT THE MOVIEFor Colored Girls 1/2 (out of four)Stars Whoopi Goldberg Janet Jackson Kimberly Elise Loretta Devine Thandie Newton Phylicia Rashad Michael Ealy Kerry Washington Director Tyler PerryDistributor LionsgateRating R for some disturbing violence including a rape sexual content and languageRunning time 2 hoursOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Monologues and melodrama rarely work in contemporary movies exploring social ills. In For Colored Girls director Tyler Perry (Madea Goes to Jail) takes a tone-deaf approach in his adaptation of Ntozake Shanges 1974 Obie-winning play for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf. Where Shange melded poetry drama and dance to explore black female identity Perry opts for strained soap opera. Nearly all his creative decisions go wrong. Shanges ""choreo-poem"" is not easy to translate to the screen and Perrys earnest ambition is admirable. As the most financially successful African-American filmmaker he could have simply made another sitcom-style comedy and raked in the millions. TRAILER Get to know For Colored Girls But none of that changes the fact that Perry has wrung the beauty and truth out of the original in almost every way possible. For Colored Girls weaves together the stories of nine women all coping with varying degrees of torment. Casting is not the problem. Perry assembled talented actors some of whom manage to eke out an honest moment or two. But its as if he encouraged them to overdo it. Any inclination toward subtlety is replaced by overwrought emotion. Particularly wince-inducing is Whoopi Goldbergs unintentionally comic portrayal of a religious zealot mother. And Thandie Newton is strangely mannered as her promiscuous daughter. Perry alternately flattens the drama into episodic conventionality and pumps it up to histrionic levels. As if to illustrate his love of melodrama he awkwardly intersperses a woman being brutally date-raped with the climactic aria in a staged opera. Perry has updated the narrative to present day creating new scenarios and incorporating the original lyrical language. But what felt timely and even radical 30-plus years ago seems false and sentimental under Perrys clumsy direction. And the time frame is strangely jumbled. If its set in current day why would a character have to submit to a gritty back-room abortion? Perry repeatedly employs tight soap-opera-style camera angles that are awkwardly edited and distracting blends of sharp and soft focus that serve only to take the viewer out of the movie. And speaking of distractions Janet Jackson in a leaden performance sounds and looks eerily like her late brother Michael. Her overly made-up appearance might as well be a Devil Wears Prada mannequin. Kimberly Elise gives the best performance as a beleaguered woman with an abusive boyfriend (Michael Ealy). The women come together in the end to provide support for one another. But Perry dilutes the power of their original archetypal roles having drained almost all authenticity out of this tale of womanhood and hardship.

"Movie review For Colored Girls - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Richard LawsonMovie review For Colored GirlsTyler Perry breathes new life into Ntozake Shanges unforgettable study of the struggles of black women. With an ensemble that includes Whoopi Goldberg Janet Jackson and Loretta Devine the emotions are raw often brutally so and transcendent.November 05 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic ""For Colored Girls"" is not easy. Its poetry is hot and searing its story an unbroken current of rage and pain and sex and abuse and solidarity and self and empowerment. Nine women a in screams whispers and weeping a demand that you listen that you dont look away that you deal with the discomfort as they did. It is a film destined to polarize. Many will hate it. Hopefully more will love it or at least allow room for it for its raw brutality its extremes its difficult truths. Filmmaker Tyler Perry takes us into this heart of darkness with his remarkable adaptation of Ntozake Shanges series of poems ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" first published in 1975. Designed for the stage it was a sort of dance of life a feminist and racial polemic with the women a draped in blue yellow red brown green purple or orange a moving across the stage each pausing to tell her story moving on. It made its way from San Francisco to Broadway to much acclaim but confounded those who thought about it as a movie. Perry has found the answer. With a surgical precision the writer-director cut it apart and reassembled it using various pieces to create characters and storylines keeping much of the poetry writing the connective tissue himself so that it finds a new life a somewhat different life on screen. A high-profile ensemble of black actresses a Janet Jackson Loretta Devine Kimberly Elise Thandie Newton Phylicia Rashad Anika Noni Rose Tessa Thompson Kerry Washington Whoopi Goldberg and Macy Gray a shrug themselves into these lives. The men a Michael Ealy Omari Hardwick Hill Harper Khalil Kain Richard Lawson a are varying degrees of monstrous (with the exception of Harpers character) and the film is not all that concerned with understanding them deeply or forgiving them whatever their scars. ""For Colored Girls"" is the most mature work yet for Perry whose emotional nakedness is as visible in this piece as that of his cast. He coaxes standout performances from Elise (""Beloved"" ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman"") as Crystal an abused wife and mother facing crushing loss; Thompson (""When a Stranger Calls"") as Nyla a teenager discovering sex and paying for it with pregnancy; Rose (""Dreamgirls"") as Yasmine a single woman trying to survive a rape; and veteran stage and screen actress Devine (""Waiting to Exhale"" ""The Preachers Wife"") uncomfortable with middle age brilliant in lacing her pain at betrayal with irony bringing the production its few light notes. There is no sign of Madea the towering African American grandmother that Perry has turned into an icon and an empire with her sharp tongue lashed around laughter spitting out judgment on gales of whoops and hollers in countless productions for stage and film for more than a decade. He is helped in setting the tone with beautiful cinematography from Alexander Gruszynski who has been bringing an increasing polish to Perrys films since they began collaborating on 2009s ""Madea Goes to Jail"" and especially later that year with ""I Can Do Bad All by Myself."" The look of the film reflects the drama of the piece through simplicity and space a ghetto grime and ground-down women shot as portraiture. Earthy tones warm until they go into Jacksons world where her Jo a rich magazine editor is all fire and ice in red and white. Though not much is made of the specifics most of the story unfolds in a six-block area of Harlem pulled from one of the 20 poems that make up Shanges original work which begins ""I usedta live in the world/then I moved to HARLEM/amp; my universe is now six blocksa|"" As stark as the words are the visuals underscore just how much of a climb we have ahead of us. One of the early scenes unfolds in the interior of the apartment house where many of the women live a a walkup with a staircase that seems to wind up endlessly. The narrative begins with the womens voices making a choral round of the first poem ""dark phases."" For the rest of the film Perry manages a near seamless integration of poetry and traditional dialogue that turns out to feel more natural than you might expect. Its themes are reflective of the dark reality for many a Yasmine explains that though she knew the man who raped her ""if youve been seen in public wit him/danced one dance a| pressin charges will be as hard/as keepin yr legs closed/while five fools try to run a train on youa|"" There are so many sharp edges to these characters and some cut the wrong way or not at all. In a piece like this that is so operatic in nature its hard to hide the weak spots Newtons Tangie swings too wildly; Goldbergs Alice clad in white and rage never finds traction; and Rashad as the apartment manager Gilda the central link between many of the characters never quite connects so it often feels as if shes walked onto the wrong stage. Whatever stumbles there may be they are offset by moments when ""For Colored Girls"" soars. One of the most powerful comes deep in the film when Jo (Jackson) and her husband Carl (Hardwick) have taken their broken marriage to an opera. As the concert hall fills up with the rich sounds of ""La Donna in Viola"" an aria written by the films composer Aaron Zigman for the scene and performed by opera singer Karen Slack and soul singer Andrea Jones-Sojola the camera cuts between images of the women individuals alone. But the ultimate strength of the piece that Shange first envisioned and Perry understands is found whenever the women come together never more movingly than in the final scene. It is a moment stripped down to its essence understated emotional and one the director handles with exquisite care. It is not easy. It is unforgettable. betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESMovie Review Sucker PunchMarch 25 2011Capsule movie reviewsNovember 19 2010Tyler Perry takes on For Colored GirlsNovember 3 2010The Wearing and Tearing of Richard TylerFebruary 26 2006MORE STORIES ABOUTRichard LawsonCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-for-colored-girls-20101105,0,258800.story",200,forcoloredgirls13,forcoloredgirls,latimes

Case in point Tyler Perrys all-star adaptation of Ntozake Shanges acclaimed 1975 play.Here are some differences between Shanges theater milestone For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf and Perrys rest stop of a movie For Colored Girls.In Shanges play women share their stories of having left a dangerous place for a safe one. They use poetry and movement to purge themselves of the pain ultimately drawing lessons and support from one another. Though Perrys adaptation retains several of Shanges ""choreopoems"" it focuses as much on the abusive men as on the women recovering their dignity. It is one thing to hear narratives of abuse. It is entirely another to see the rapist and the rape which turns abuse into spectacle.At its best Shanges work is a lyric journey through the storm to the rainbow. At its worst Perrys movie is a relentless dance between the victimizer and his victim. Shanges poetic flow gets choked by Perrys stilted prose.The takeaway of Shanges work is a hallelujah chorus of female self-respect; that of the dirgelike movie is ""Nobody Knows the Man Troubles Ive Seen Tyler Perry Knows My Sorrow."" Perry molds the source material into another variation on his theme of the good woman deceived and/or abused by her no-good tomcattin loverman.Shange gives us archetypes; Perry trades in stereotypes.For the most part Ive enjoyed Perrys seriocomic melodramas. And while I applaud him for venturing outside his comfort zone he defaults to it here veering from the back-alley toxicity of Precious to the penthouse sterility of The Devil Wears Prada. It could give a girl emotional whiplash.This said many of the individual performances in Perrys film are moving beyond words. Kimberly Elise Thandie Newton Phylicia Rashad Anika Noni Rose and Kerry Washington exalt the poetry in Shange and find the same in Perrys new dialogue. They shake you to the core. Reliable Loretta Devine dispenses laughter as a palliative for pain.About the Kabuki theatrics of Janet Jackson and the actorly histrionics of Whoopi Goldberg and Macy Gray the less said the better.Shanges Everywomen are individual colors who collectively make a rainbow. Perry forces their proximity (and specificity) by situating four of them in the same Harlem tenement.As Gilda the building manager Rashad stands like a great-rooted tree whose branches protect the others. To the left of her apartment lives Crystal (Elise hollow of eye and heart) with her psychologically disturbed husband (Michael Ealy) and their two little ones. To the right lives Tangie (Newton) a promiscuous bartender engaged in serial power struggles with her pickups reenactments of her own abuse. Downstairs lives Juanita (Devine) a nurse who counsels young women at a clinic but cant help loving that man.Entering their lives is Kelly (Washington) a social worker with the only healthy relationship in the film but likewise a victim of past male perfidy.With the exceptions the other performances are near faultless including that of Tessa Thompson as Newtons kid sister an aspiring dancer at the studio of Yasmine (Rose).Applaud Perry for getting the best from most of his actresses. Boo him for not building to a climax as deeply felt as the movies individual components. For Colored Girls is a textbook case of the whole being considerably less than the sum of its parts.Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Tyler Perry is no stranger to kitchen-sink melodrama. But ""For Colored Girls is the kitchen sink the washing machine the curling iron the sofa and the ironing board. Its Oscar Emmy Grammy Tony and Razzie. Its astounding. Its terrible. Its astounding. Then terrible again. Its too much -- too much screaming too much crying too much preaching too much reaching too much healing too much feeling and by the time a man dangles two small black children from an apartment window its too much too-much. The audience I saw it with didnt seem to know whether to clap when it was over or start taking Lipitor.Perry has written and directed eight movies in four years. ""For Colored Girls makes nine and he goes at it like a fat person the night before a new diet. Its binge directing. Most of his movies -- including ""Madea Goes to Jail and ""Tyler Perrys Why Did I Get Married Too -- are based on his own stage work. This time hes turned to the work of a more esteemed playwright. ""For Colored Girls is based on Ntozake Shanges ""for colored girls who have considered suicide/ when the rainbow is enuf which since its premiere in the mid-1970s has been as common as ""Our Town on black stages. Shange had written a lyrical 20-poem bulletin -- she called it a ""choreopoem -- of black womens state of mind. Seven unnamed characters -- theyre identified by the color of their costumes -- from different American cities share a stage and a vacillating psyche.Perry has dispersed her words to nine central characters whom hes situated in and around an apartment building in Harlem. The women now have names and embody distinct types. Monologues that Shange wrote for one character are whittled down and spread among several women then trumped up with generous helpings of Perrys own ideas which include conversational dialogue and gasp men. Hes plucked Shange out of the poetical ether and dragged her down to earth.A social worker named Kelly (Kerry Washington) checks in on Crystal (Kimberly Elise) whose jobless war-veteran husband (Michael Ealy) beats on her and her kids. Crystal endures violent tirades at home and aggravation downtown at her job working for Jo (Janet Jackson) an imperious magazine editor -- its ""The Devil Wears Titanium. Across the hall from Crystal are Tangie (Thandie Newton) a sniping sex-aholic bartender and Gilda (Phylicia Rashad) the nosy building manager. Once a day Tangies mother Alice (Whoopi Goldberg) wanders up from downstairs robed and turbaned in white to ask for money that could be going to her religious cult; her younger daughter Nyla (Tessa Thompson); or something new to shove in their cramped apartment. Nyla is a dancer who in her first scene ecstatically describes the recent loss of her virginity. Her instructor Yasmine (Anika Noni Rose) is wary of physical intimacy but eager to get to know the executive (Kalil Kain) who woos her every morning on their way to work. Juanita (Loretta Devine) is a nurse with a second job at a community clinic. She also has a useless man residing in Gildas building.In the opening sequence there they all are these ""half-notes scattered without rhythm trudging down the stairwell slamming doors shouting at each other sucking their teeth. How did a seminal work of the stage become an extra-strength episode of ""227?Perry truly wants to speak to a moment. In doing so the movie rests somewhere between sermon and lurid public service announcement. Devine demonstrates to her patients how to use a condom. Theres a trip to a back-alley abortionist (Macy Gray) whose rusty tools (more gasps) wouldnt be out of place in ""Saw IV. Somebodys man is on the down-low. Someone else is headed for a showdown with her mother. One of these somebodies will contract a telltale cough that makes sense only in Victorian England.One night Jo takes her husband (Omari Hardwick) to box seats at the opera. While tears leak from her eyes she misses what her husband is up to. Across town a different character is being raped. Perry moves to and fro -- the assault the husband the tears the opera the dinner burning on a stove -- until the movie threatens to blow a gasket.Shange provides the spiritual inspiration for ""For Colored Girls -- so do Tennessee Williams and Agnes Nixon and Gloria Naylor -- but Perry is clearly under a competing influence. In nearly every scene what comes to mind is Lee Danielss ""Precious which Perry executive produced. Danielss exposed-nerve filmmaking -- his movies success -- might have affected Perry. Could he make a movie that was as raw perceptive emotionally vivid and real? Ha Hes made nine.""For Colored Girls is ""Precious on steroids a kind of mutant issue movie. Its powerfully ridiculous and ridiculously powerful. Perrys conceit is that within every ordinary woman resides this beautiful language that can lilt out of her or erupt. When she finds it shes invincible.Each actor has her moment or two particularly the older actors -- Rashad Goldberg and Devine. Rashad does nosy-neighbor with shocking integrity but she infuses her speeches with August Wilson and Shakespeare. When Devine recites the opening lines of the most famous passage -- ""somebody took all my stuff -- her voice is music.""For Colored Girls often wants to create an earthquake that swallows us up whole. Part of this is a matter of over-identification. Perry has been playing a black woman for so long -- hes starred as the armed-and-dangerous Madea in at least five movies -- that he practically is one. But black men in Perrys movie are a source of visceral physical ache. Its as if a brother has broken his heart too. For peace and redemption hes turned as many a woman has to Shange. How cathartic this has been for him is unclear. His movie is caught between wallow and triumph. Shange wasnt interested in victims regardless of how special they were. But you get the sense that ""Tyler Perrys SVU would suit him fine.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Nina Simone contributed only one original song to her 1966 album Wild Is The Wind but it isnt easily forgotten. ""Four Women"" offers four verses of concise moving portraits that get beneath the surfaces of four stereotypes of African-American womanhood with such attention to psychological detail that by each verses end its impossible to see them as stereotypes anymore. Playwright and poet Ntozake Shange might have had Simones song in mind when she penned her 1975 theater piece For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When The Rainbow Is Enuf a collection of 20 choreographed poems--""choreopoems"" to use Shanges term--voiced by seven performers. Each is identified only by the color of her clothing and each offers a vivid lyrical expression of different experiences of what it was like to be a black woman in America at a time when such expressions were rarely heard onstage much less on TV or in movies. A version of Simones song joining her voice to contemporary singers plays over the closing credits of For Colored Girls Tyler Perrys adaptation of Shanges play. Its an unnecessary update of the song but a respectful one. The same cant be said of the film. Theres no right way to do an adaptation particularly a difficult-to-adapt work like this but there are plenty of wrong ways and Perrys film offers a casebook of things-not-to-do. For starters he tries to join all those disparate voices into a story one mostly centered around a five-story walk-up home to many of the films characters. These include Crystal (Kimberly Elise; yes the women have names here) the assistant to a high-powered magazine editor (Janet Jackson) and mother of two children by an abusive psychologically damaged military vet. She lives next door to a wise knowing older woman (Phylicia Rashad) and across the hall from Tangie (Thandie Newton) a sexually aggressive emotionally unsatisfied cocktail waitress. Tangie in turn lives above her mother (Whoopi Goldberg) a hoarder cult member and mother to a bright college-bound girl (Tessa Thompson) who isnt sure what to do about her unplanned pregnancy. Theres more all of it as soapy in its presentation as it sounds by bare description and little of it allowing enough room for Shanges source material which is largely shoehorned with little grace between plot developments. The upside is that much of the cast does right by the source material which makes it to the screen especially Loretta Devine and Anika Noni Rose who get to deliver some memorable monologues with little interruption. Others arent so lucky and nobody gets spared the expected Perry moralizing that removes any ambiguity from Shanges work and makes every development a matter of right and wrong. Thats to say nothing of some tasteless staging choices--including a rape scene cut against an opera aria--and an update thats only half there. Incorporating talk of HIV makes sense in 2010; a warning against the perils of back-alley abortions less sense. But being caught between eras isnt the films real problem its the way the film keeps muffling voices that want to sing.

Comments (1) For Colored Girls Recommended Video Rated R  120 minutes  2010 Tyler Perry is occasionally undone by his penchant for melodrama but it serves him well in this searing adaptation of Ntozake Shanges landmark 1974 play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf. Perry benefits from the fire heft velocity and lyricism of the language but he also updates the material and makes it work onscreen eliciting powerhouse performances from an ensemble of actresses. Especially fine are Kimberly Elise as an abused mother Thandie Newton as a promiscuous bartender Phylicia Rashad as a building manager whos seen it all and in a vivid cameo Macy Gray as a back-alley abortionist. Male characters dont come off well in this volcanically feminist tale but the subtext is that men crippled by racism and neglect turn their rage on women.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME In its first pages Ntozake Shanges passionate 1975 play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf posed a question about its seven main characters all black women who have survived abuse or trauma. ""Are we ghouls? children of horror? the joke?"" Those seven ladies identified only by colors were fierce in their pain and powerful in both their rage and healing. Thirty-five years later Shanges prose still begs to be read aloud; you want to feel those words in your mouth. Her eloquent women were no joke. (See the 25 most important films on race.) But Tyler Perrys movie version of Shanges play its title shortened to For Colored Girls does feel like a ghoulish joke a dated horror show bordering on parody. Its both operatic and tone deaf with explosions of hysteria that include a drunken Macy Gray performing a back-alley abortion and the conversion of a poem spoken by Shanges Lady in Purple into an actual opera by Perrys regular composer Aaron Zigman (called La Donna In Viola). During the opera the film cuts back and forth between a doomed couple silently watching the performance (the husband is on the down low unbeknownst to the wife) and another character being savagely date-raped. It is an agony of melodrama. (See Tyler Perry on the TIME 100.) This is a shame because there are some fine actresses in this large ensemble cast and when each gets her chance -- in tight close-up -- to deliver monologues constructed from Shanges poetry youre temporarily jolted out of your conviction that this is the most astonishingly hammy and misguided production of the year. From this bad movie someone could make a great if odd short film. The seven colored girls in the title of Shanges play addressed us from the outskirts of cities like Chicago Detroit Houston and Baltimore but most of Tylers characters speak to us from Harlem. Perry has built a narrative that revolves around an apartment building which is home to a cranky nymphomaniac named Tangie (Thandie Newton) a sanctimonious building manager named Gilda (Phylicia Rashad) a fellow named Frank (Richard Lawson) whose oft-dumped girlfriend Juanita (Loretta Devine) drops by to shriek at his locked door and Crystal (Kimberly Elise who starred in Perrys Diary of a Mad Black Woman). Crystal spends her days working as an editorial assistant at a fashion magazine run by chilly bitchy Jo (Janet Jackson) and then comes home to physical abuse at the hands of Beau Willie (Michael Ealy) the father of her two insanely adorable children. Elises performance is the only restrained one in the film and her Crystal is For Colored Girls most compelling character despite being subjected to a dramatic scenario so blatantly manipulative that even Jodi Picoult might have refused to go there. Others featured in the cast include Tessa Thompson as Nyla Tangies teenage sister and a disappointing Whoopi Goldberg as Alice their lunatic cult member mother. (Perrys directors notes to Goldberg must have been along the lines of ""mean zombie."") Even more peripheral are Kerry Washington as an infertile social worker desperate for a baby (in the recent Mother and Child she was an infertile baker desperate for a child) and Nylas dance teacher (Anika Noni Rose) who is introduced as annoyingly chipper and then -- bring on the audience guilt for wanting her to shut up about the joys of Salsa -- brutally abused before our eyes. It goes without saying that nearly every male character here is a stock negative stereotype; the closest thing to a nice guy in this cast is an insensitive police officer. This is to the best of my knowledge the first Tyler Perry movie to be screened in advance for the press an indication presumably of his excitement over the film which is certainly a departure from his customary boisterous comedies. (Its a boisterous bummer.) Perry doesnt need critical acclaim -- hes the most successful black filmmaker of all time with an audience that shows up no matter what -- but I would have enjoying giving him some for For Colored Girls. There is no question that he loves the material as much as anyone. Hell introduce Shanges play to a new generation and there is absolute value in that. But For Colored Girls feels like the cinematic equivalent to putting a garish reproduction of the Sistine Chapel on the ceiling of your McMansion and calling it art.

"""For Colored Girls"" a 1 1/2 stars - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs ""For Colored Girls"" a 1 1/2 starsNovember 04 2010|By Michael Phillips | Tribune movie criticSomebody almost ran off with all of Ntozake Shanges stuff to paraphrase one of the most vibrant poems in Shanges ""For Colored Girls."" Its a sad situation because that somebody is Tyler Perry whose broadly popular tastes and talents far exceed the Madea franchise for which he became famous. He loved Shanges powerhouse of a play (full title ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf"") enough to champion and then personally implement its unlikely transfer from the stage to the multiplex. So what happens when a stage phenomenons ardent admirer becomes its undoing on screen? Youd have to go back to Sidney Lumets version of ""Equus"" a generation ago to find such highly stylized material brought to the screen with a heavier hand. It is one thing to hear unforgettably in Shanges original a woman describing her boyfriend dangling their two young children out an apartment window and then letting go. It is quite another to see this visualized with the music and the melodrama pumping up the emotion to the point of grim parody. First staged in 1974 in a Berkeley Calif. coffeehouse Shanges stage piece consists of 20 narrative poems performed by seven actresses. Understandably Perry felt a film version needed more narrative machinery. Several of the women now live in the same Harlem apartment building managed by a newly created earth-mother character played (very well) by Phylicia Rashad. Bloodline and neighborhood connections are made among various people and Perry has invented several new characters female and male to flesh out the ensemble and give it a ""Crash""-like vibe of colliding destinies. Here and there the mixture of poetry and realism catches hold. A character named Juanita played by Loretta Devine runs a community center health clinic and writing workshop; Devine gets the ""stuff"" poem a wonderful joyous creation that in part goes like this ""somebody almost run off wit alla my stuff/ amp; i waz standin there/ lookin at myself/ the whole time...waz a man faster n my innocence."" To this richness Perry adds social-service axioms from a different planet entirely (""HIV is not the death sentence it used to be"" someone says at one point). Janet Jackson recycles the icy career monster she played in Perrys ""Why Did I Get Married"" pictures and her characters dilemma (mysterious Mr. Perfect husband might be stepping out) and personality traits simply dont jibe with Shanges creations. By the time Thandie Newton (as a trollop in need of enlightenment) and Whoopi Goldberg (as her unfeeling mother) get into a literal smackdown near the end youre reminded that even good performers need modulation and that maximum volume does not always equal maximum effectiveness. The key issues of the original -- abortion date rape infidelity a yearning for a fuller self -- are all here but the actresses treat each moment like a strenuous Oscar bid. The appeal of the original went far beyond the specifics of being black or female in the 70s or any time. The adaptations limitations make the play seem quaint out of date. ""Give me something with some sort of style"" Jacksons character seethes at one point dismissing some magazine page proofs like an African-American Miranda Priestley. Perry shouldve listened to her. Aiming for a piece with the raw impact of ""Precious"" on which he served as executive producer he ends up with 134 minutes of misjudged intensity. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for some disturbing violence including a rape sexual content and language) Cast Janet Jackson (Jo/Red); Thandie Newton (Tangie/Orange); Whoopi Goldberg (Alice/White); Phylicia Rashad (Gilda); Anika Noni Rose (Yasmine/Yellow); Loretta Devine (Juanita/Green); Kimberly Elise (Crystal/Brown); Kerry Washington (Kelly/Blue) Credits Written and directed by Tyler Perry; based on the play ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf"" by Ntozake Shange; produced by Tyler Perry Paul Hall and Roger M.

For Colored Girls (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review For Colored Girls (R) Tyler Perry stumbles with this melodramatic adaptation Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald11/3/2010 Editor rating 1 There are so many gifted African-American actresses packed into For Colored Girls and the movies source material is so rich with potential (Ntozake Shanges Obie-winning play For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf) that the films utter failure as a piece of engaging vibrant drama feels especially disappointing. Writer-director Tyler Perry setting aside all the comedic and satirical slants of his previous works (Diary of a Mad Black Woman Why Did I Get Married?) to opt for morose drama has respectfully kept large chunks of Shanges choreopoem intact giving each of his seven female protagonists lengthy monologues about their plights. Among them A woman married to an abusive alcoholic husband; a social worker who longs to have children but was left barren by an STD and a party girl who sleeps with a different guy each night to overcome the memory of her fathers abuse. Perry has built a lucrative and beloved niche from films aimed specifically at black women but none of those pictures bore the painfully theatrical artifice of For Colored Girls which tries to insert Shanges lyrical poetry into a realistic Harlem tenement where most of the characters live. Of the large cast Janet Jackson is a standout as a high-powered magazine editor whose husband is leading a double life and Thandie Newton cuts a tragic figure for using sex to quell her inner demons. But with such a large cast none of the actors is able to turn her character into a fully realized person. The women are just symbols of pain. Whoopi Goldbergs portrayal of a religious fanatic oblivious to the world around her or Phylicia Rashad as the tenements manager (and the films Greek chorus) are even shakier performances ... showy star turns that detract from the film. For Colored Girls is so relentlessly focused on the cruel and evil things men do to women that the movie never feels anchored to any sort of reality Its a work of relentless suffocating melodrama. What might have worked on the stage as transcendent and moving feels plodding and repetitive onscreen - an example of a filmmakers tackling tricky complex material that is way over his head.

For Colored Girls Bad to fair Director Tyler Perry. Cast Kimberly Elise Janet Jackson Thandie Newton. Rating Rated R for some disturbing violence including a rape sexual content and language. Qamp;A Janet Jackson | Qamp;A Thandie Newton Kimberly Elise From Mad to sad in Colored Girls Spotlight Tyler Perry Theres also no question that when they get a chance to perform they deserve a better movie than ""For Colored Girls."" Tyler Perrys film is a dramatization of Ntozake Shanges play ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" and it gathers a large group of talented Black women most of whom are good in individual performances. The movie as a whole however doesnt do their work justice struggling as it does to find a credible balance between the poetry of the stage play and the melodrama Perry creates when choosing bits and pieces of it to tell the story; the film comes off as one long litany of lament and tragedy that never fits together. Thus when Tessa Thompsons Nyla is asked about yet another tragedy she first responds by saying she has nothing to say before launching into a lengthy soliloquy. Shes good the part of the poem is good but the context in which its placed is just . . . bad. Theres no other word for it. Perry repeatedly breaks into the narrative for poetic recitations which takes the audience out of the scene. The film revolves around a group of women in Harlem friends relatives acquaintances whose paths cross at various times. They include Jo (Janet Jackson) a stereotypically tough editor at a magazine who rose from the ghetto to a position of power and Crystal (Kimberly Elise) Jos long-suffering assistant whose boyfriend (Michael Ealy) returns from war an abusive alcoholic. Across the hall from Crystal is Tangie (Thandie Newton) whose sexuality masks a secret. Her mother (Whoopi Goldberg) is lost in a religious fog; her sister (Thompson) cant understand why Tangie doesnt like her but seems to be starting to mirror Tangies behavior. Kelly (Kerry Washington) is a social worker who will have dealings with some of the women. Yasmine (Anika Noni Rose) Nylas dance teacher will suffer horribly like almost everyone else. At the center of both the hallway of Tangie and Crystals building and the story is Gilda (Phylicia Rashad) who provides advice and wisdom and whatnot. Her areas of expertise are limitless evidently and her talents range from demands for simple politeness to dispensing genuine empathy. Rashad works hard at the role but cant overcome its limitations. ""For Colored Girls"" is relentless in its sorrow with little relief. Taken separately the stories might have had resonance. And while its easy to admire the acting - Elise whose characters life goes from bad to worse (whose doesnt?) is especially effective - too often Perry mistakes overwrought melodrama for effective drama. Its not an acceptable substitute. You dont watch the film so much as endure it admiring the individual efforts applauding the chance for so many talented women of color to work together and hoping that the next time it happens the movie theyre in doesnt let them down.

Perrys movies tend to lurch from scene to scene; the visual composition is characteristically sloppy; and the storytelling shaped by Perrys early successes with road-show theatrical productions is maddeningly choppy and artificially inflated by overheated dialogue. And yet the approach works for the man -- at least when hes making a Tyler Perry Movie. For Colored Girls however is definitely not a Tyler Perry Movie at least not by origin Its the first film adaptation of For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf. A blazing choreo-poetic-theatrical creation by the New Jersey-born poet Ntozake Shange Colored Girls rocked the American stage in the 1970s. Nearly four decades later Perry has taken Shanges feminist word-and-movement portraits of disenfranchised African-American women and turned those howls into...a maddeningly choppy mess of a Tyler Perry movie. Here women (crossing paths in a faux run-down stage-set Harlem apartment building) are in trouble or wronged or hurting yet by God theyre strong. The female cast is great with especially fierce performances from Loretta Devine Kimberly Elise Phylicia Rashad and Anika Noni Rose. But stuck in a flailing production that might just as well invite Perrys signature drag creation Madea to the block party the actors earnest work isnt enuf.

Though striving for artistic legitimacy in bringing Shanges incomparable play to the screen Perry indulges his worst instincts for melodrama in For Colored Girls shoehorning her text into his own tawdry narrative--a process similar to watching Madea squeeze into a size 8 dress.Hilton Als in his critical essay on Perry in The New Yorker presciently sounded the alarm back in April ""[H]e will likely emphasize Shanges sentimentality rather than her force or her feminist radicalism."" Perry the most financially successful black filmmaker ever has shown interest in moving beyond shopworn suffering-and-redemption tales only twice before in Why Did I Get Married? (2007) which succeeded as an honest attempt to examine real adult problems and in the treatment of Kathy Bates and Alfre Woodards interracial friendship in the otherwise awful The Family That Preys (2008). Translating Shanges work to the screen Perry--whose films nearly all began as plays--is tone-deaf to its passion and courage. Her play touted at the time as ""a celebration of being black and being woman"" is a collection of 20 prose-poems punctuated by dance and music and performed by a cast of seven women on a spare stage each identified only by the color of her dress. Recounting rites of passage (losing ones virginity) horrors (rape domestic violence) and pleasures (intellectual and carnal) Shanges text whether seen live or read silently soars with the power and precision of her language. Her women suffer and mourn but they are never victims.In Perrys version almost all of them end up in the hospital. Expanding the number of central characters to nine--whose abject storylines frequently intersect in the walk-up where Thandie Newtons sex addict lives on the same floor as Kimberly Elises battered common-law wife--and writing roles for the men only referred to in Shanges work he re-creates the template found in many of his nine previous films the martyred woman abused and/or deceived by her pathological mate.For Colored Girls opens with Perrys women all but one of them living or working in Harlem starting their day each reciting in voiceover a line or two from ""Dark Phrases"" the poem that begins Shanges play (and culminates in ""Let her be born/Let her be born/amp; handled warmly""). Its the only instance of her words flowing naturally and organically. Using 14 of the originals poems he either weaves snippets of her language into his plot-propelled dialogue--so that lines from the originals ""Pyramid"" are repurposed as the teary explanation Kerry Washingtons social worker gives to her husband about how she got an STD in college--or lifts entire passages outright with no transition from his own meager dialogue.With the exception of some of Madeas more inspired outbursts Perry has rarely done much with language beyond rehashing the emptiest pop-psych self-help speak. ""I know I have issues with trust"" says Janet Jacksons icy magazine editrix Jo--a complete Perry invention and one clearly modeled on Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada--to her husband who helpfully responds ""You dont just have trust issues. You have issues.""Jos man in another Perry contrivance is on the down-low; she confronts him about his extramarital activities (""I see the way you look at other men the pool boy in the Hamptons my driver . . ."") after she gets the results of an HIV test--her positive status ludicrously hinted at twice in the film by a Camille-like cough. Shange updated her play by including a reference to safe sex and HIV during its 20th anniversary production but Perry is incapable of staging a contemporary subject without resorting to broad maudlin soap opera.The greatest frustration--not just in For Colored Girls but in Perrys entire oeuvre--is witnessing talented (and often criminally underemployed) actresses struggle with the material theyve been given. Anika Noni Rose takes off when reciting Shanges words only to be brought down into the abyss of Perrys melodrama after she is date-raped (a scene that further reveals the directors wrong moves when it comes to showing versus telling). Loretta Devine playing a nurse makes the awkwardly introduced Shange poem ""Somebody Almost Walked Off Wid Alla My Stuff"" sing. Everything else is too much--or not enuf.

TWITTER For once Tyler Perry doesnt put his name above the title but perhaps he should with ""For Colored Girls"" to distinguish this train wreck of a movie from the stunning theater piece of 36 years ago by Ntozake Shange. Hers was a tragic and sensuous hybrid of poetry dance drama and feminist theology -- it even has been called the most important work about black female identity ever. Perry might be very much in touch with his feminine side when he dons a dress and padding to play his larger-than-life character Madea but his style is too crude and stagy for Shanges transformative evocation of black female life and his moralizing strikes exactly the wrong notes to express the pain and longing that cries out from her heated poetry. ""Girls"" certainly will turn off those who know Shanges play but what will Perrys usual audience make of his foray into date rape domestic violence homosexuality back-room abortion and promiscuity? One should never gainsay Perrys ability to attract large opening-weekend crowds but word-of- mouth could be toxic. ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" -- to give the full title of the theater piece -- never was going to make an easy transition to the screen. The ""choreopoem"" as Shange dubbed it has no conventional plot or characters. Performers give life to the poetry as characters are described merely as ""lady in red"" or ""lady in white."" In so doing they speak to the issues of sexuality violence spirituality and the discovery of ones identity. No it never was going to be easy but someone needed to put creative sweat into this one to reach for cinematic solutions to the theatrical challenge. All Perry does is force conventional plots and characters -- utter cliches without lives or souls -- into the fabric of Shanges literary work. The hackneyed melodramas get him from one poem to the next but run roughshod over the collective sense of who these women are. Then when Perry arrives at the next poetic passage the switch in writing between him and Shange is jarringly pronounced. The words belong to different worlds. Perry situates his nine female protagonists in Harlem supposedly in the modern day but then how does a backroom abortion figure into this contemporary scene? Most of his women live in a crummy walk-up tenement though not Janet Jacksons Jo a high-powered magazine executive with a corner office and an East Side penthouse. Perry gives his frequent star no favors here with hairdo makeup and clothes that make her look like a mannequin. However Jos beleaguered assistant Crystal (Kimberly Elise) -- Perrys commercial instincts insist that he lifts from ""The Devil Wears Prada"" -- does live in that walk-up where an abusive alcoholic husband (Michael Ealy) is a constant threat to her and their two children. Building manager Gilda (Phylicia Rashad) has her eye on the situation as well as the one across the hall where Tangie (Thandie Newton) entertains a different man every night. Tangies Bible-toting mother Alice (Whoopi Goldberg) and a younger sister Nyla (Tessa Thompson) occupy an apartment downstairs which keeps a kind of demilitarized zone between members of the warring family. Meanwhile Juanita (Loretta Devine) down the hall fails to listen to her own advice as a nurse who runs a womens clinic at a community center when she continually lets a two-timing guy back into her life. Others who get connected to the building include Kelly (Kerry Washington) a social worker who responds to Gildas call about child abuse and inexplicably does nothing about it and Yasmine (Anika Noni Rose) who teaches dance to Nyla. The male characters other than Hill Harpers police detective are all sick cartoons existing only to perpetuate horrors on the women. In Perrys peculiar view though the women often collaborate in their victimhood. They invite the stranger into the home or let men stay when they clearly should go. They all fall from grace. When reciting Shanges words the actresses often achieve moments of splendor. Some even achieve dignity within the hoary melodrama. This is especially true of Rashad who acts as a kind of Greek chorus; Elise whose character must cope with unspeakable tragedy; and Rose who must search for an outlet for her rage and humiliation. All technical aspects of the production are solid though the sets never fail to look like sets.

Its not ""Precious"" but ""For Colored Girls"" marks an advance for Tyler Perry as well as a big step back. In adapting Ntozake Shanges Tony-nominated play -- a cycle of poetic monologues about abuse abortion and other issues facing modern black women rather than a traditional narrative -- the do-it-all auteur demonstrates an ambition beyond any of his previous work. And yet the result falls squarely in familiar territory better acted and better lit perhaps but more inauthentically melodramatic than ever. Perrys faithful should ensure a healthy berth for his 10th feature while cast and pedigree will give ""Girls"" longer legs. Perry was considered a controversial choice to direct Shanges celebrated ""choreopoem"" and understandably so. Though the text of the playwrights most affecting poems is virtually intact Perry has unmistakably wrestled ""Girls"" into the same soap-opera mold of his earlier pics connecting the passionate testimonials with cliched characterizations and two-bit psychoanalysis. In Shanges original 1975 show seven African-American dancers each dressed in a different color and identified not by name but by their place in the spectrum alternate time in the spotlight while serving as a form of support network for the others. Each represents specific individual challenges facing black women even as the group presents the communitys collective experience. But if the intention as suggested by Shanges original title (""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"") was to offer universal easily identifiable experiences then Perrys handling has regrettably diluted the effect into a series of interconnected stock stories. The mere act of translating ""For Colored Girls"" to film forces fundamental and unfortunate changes on the material softening and reducing the archetypes to specific characters. Perhaps the most fully formed of the ensemble is Crystal inspired by ""Lady in Reds"" abused-lover tale and played by Kimberly Elise star of Perrys 2005 bigscreen debut ""Diary of a Mad Black Woman."" Where the show used mere words to paint the long-suffering mothers unhappy existence here we see the sad confines of her life and meet the broken war veteran (Michael Ealy) who crosses the line trying to convince her to marry him. It all seems small by comparison the performers so obviously play-acting the situation so transparently false. While those color-coded ladies once hailed from all over --  outside Houston Chicago Detroit and so on -- theyve now been crammed under the roof of a single Harlem apartment building the exception being Crystals employer Jo (Janet Jackson) a high-powered magazine editor who shares a sleek Gotham pad with her emasculated husband (Omari Hardwick) who leads a double life on the down-low. Jos story feels the most patently Perry-fied thing about the film reflecting the directors tendency to tackle key issues through pat gently preachy examples (he similarly inserts lessons on contraception venereal disease and religious fanaticism into other subplots). ""Girls"" never feels more like daytime television than in the scene where the couple have it out back-to-back in an awkwardly blocked argument. The overcrowded ensemble also includes Thandie Newton as a liberated bartender who uses sex to address a personal shortcoming; Tessa Thompson as the kid sister whom Perry curiously saddles with both the virginity-losing and abortion-suffering poems; Whoopi Goldberg as a woman too consumed in her beliefs to tend to earthly concerns; Kerry Washington as a child welfare worker who too-ironically cant conceive; Loretta Devine as a relationship counselor with equally on-the-nose troubles in her own love life; and Anika Noni Rose as a dance instructor whose infectiously upbeat attitude cant last long. Stoically observing it all is a neighbor played by Phylicia Rashad who withholds her own secrets and consequently feels like the films weakest link (she might have been a better vessel for the ""somebody almost walked off wid alla my stuff"" piece). Theres some great acting being done here (including a chilling cameo from Macy Gray as a back-alley abortionist) but the cameras arent where they need to be to capture it and the editing isnt properly calibrated to shape what the performers are dishing out. Even the poetry feels flat delivered in a lower key than the dialogue Perry penned himself. Though the helmer films partly in New York for the first time he relies once again on his usual stable of collaborators including d.p. Alexander Gruszynski editor Maysie Hoy production designer Ina Mayhew (with her sitcom-style sets) and composer Aaron Zigman (offering a minimalist Clint Eastwood-style score) which suggests the team may be holding him back. While Perrys craft has slowly but surely improved with each successive film this latest project seems to fall beyond his reach. Just as the director was finding the organic quality that eluded him in ""Diary"" and other early efforts hes confronted with a conceptual piece that calls for an entirely different approach. Yet he cant resist turning ""For Colored Girls"" into a Tyler Perry Movie which means imposing diva worship where nuance is called for and a pleasure-punishing Christian worldview where a certain moral ambiguity might have been more appropriate.
