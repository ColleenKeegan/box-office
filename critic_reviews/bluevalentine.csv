Photo Credit AP Photo advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT An intimate look at a crumbling marriage. BOTTOM LINE Almost bruisingly powerful with intense performances from Gosling and Williams. CAST Ryan Gosling Michelle Williams Faith Wladyka WHEN/WHERE Showtimes and tickets LENGTH 154 Briefly stamped with an NC-17 rating ""Blue Valentine"" features more than one intimate scene between a husband and wife in a tawdry love motel. By the time their night is over however the ""blue"" in the title takes on a less prurient more traditional meaning. This is one of the saddest movies you will ever see. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams play Dean and Cindy a youngish couple with a daughter Frankie (6-year-old Faith Wladyka of Malverne). The film introduces them in the middle of a workday morning rush - a perfect time to observe any familys trouble spots - when Cindy is cranky and Dean is happily entertaining their daughter. He only dimly picks up his wifes signals. advertisement | advertise on newsday His solution Drop the kid at her grandparents and book a night in the ""Future Room"" decorated like a pornographic version of ""Star Wars."" This does not turn Cindys frown upside down. As the relationship worsens by the minute the film also looks backward in time - a shy first date a happy wedding - to underscore the increasing sorrow. Gosling and Williams are utterly painfully convincing as a couple driving itself apart but writer-director Derek Cianfrance unfairly chooses a side. Dean is a devoted father and loving husband whose worst crime is cluelessness; Cindy is a sullen grouch. At times the film feels like one mans long list of grievances. Still ""Blue Valentine"" has a rare emotional intensity. There is no way to prepare for its final frames inevitable as they are.

Blue Valentine Good to great Director Derek Cianfrance. Cast Ryan Gosling Michelle Williams Faith Wladyka. Rating R for graphic sexual content language and a beating. Note At Harkins Camelview. Guide to this weeks new movie releases Michelle Williams keeps an open heart Ryan Gosling has instinct for the eclectic Entertainment? Escape? Catharsis? All three in varying combinations? The question comes to mind in ""Blue Valentine"" a searing portrait of the disintegration of not just a marriage but more importantly the love that once fueled it. Guide to this weeks new releases Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are so genuine as the doomed couple in Derek Cianfrances film (he directed and co-wrote the script) that it often is painful to watch. Yes thats something said of many movies but here its almost visceral; once its done you feel terrible for these people for their lives for their daughter especially. Is that entertainment? To each his own but it is compelling and yes rewarding. When we meet Dean (Gosling) and Cindy (Williams) hes a housepainter who considers the ability to drink at 8 a.m. one of the perks of his job; she works to exhaustion in a doctors office. To the dismay of their daughter Frankie (Faith Wladyka) the family dog has gone missing and despite Frankies best efforts at calling him he doesnt come back. This sets the scene for tragedies large and small throughout. Dean and Cindy have an overnight getaway planned at a tacky motel (they go for the ""Futureworld""-themed room). But like most of their interactions things turn sour. And then Dean is working for a moving company with more hair more verve. He runs into Cindy at a nursing home where her grandmother lives. Its five years earlier and theres an energy between the two that is palpable especially compared with the version of them that we had been watching. Cianfrance is going back in time retracing the steps to investigate where things went wrong where their love started to wane. The transformation is remarkable not in a showy way but in subtle ones. Williams is extraordinary imparting the emotional and physical exhaustion of the older Cindy. But the younger Cindy is prickly curious willing to take a chance which is what dating Dean qualifies as and then some. He meanwhile is head over heels completely in love willing even to play the ukulele (and play it well) to prove it. His goal is to win her and by sheer force of will he does. For Dean thats enough. Hes perfectly happy being married to Cindy being a father to Frankie (though thats a little more complicated than we realize at first). As soon as Cindy says ""I do"" his dreams are realized. Thats sufficient for him which is the problem. Dean has no ambition beyond being Cindys husband and Frankies dad. But Cindy longs for more. What exactly we dont know. The doctor she works for values her but thats fraught with trouble as well. The scenes between the younger Dean and Cindy are joyous with giddy love. The scenes when theyre older are uncomfortable off-kilter at times ugly. Theres no blame to assign here. There are just two people in different places in their lives their differences developing into an open wound in their relationship until healing seems out of the question. Gosling and Williams are outstanding giving Dean and Cindy a genuineness that makes their happiness delightful and their unhappiness almost unbearable. Cianfrance deftly moves back and forth in time weaving a tapestry of heartbreak. ""Blue Valentine"" may be difficult to watch at times but its absolutely worth the effort.

"Blue Valentine | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; blue-valentine ) Blue Valentine (United States 2010) January 15 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Despite the fact that 50% of all marriages end in divorce no one walks to the altar with considerations other than a lifetime of shared happiness. Its a pleasant fantasy since even the best unions are fraught with bad times and difficulties. Hollywood with its insistent selling of idealized romance is an accomplice in the development of the unreasonable expectations of some from the institution of marriage. Motion picture love stories are great entertainment as long as they are seen for what they represent fairy tale simplifications of complex situations. Blue Valentine offers a refreshingly honest perspective of a situation in which ""happily ever after"" does not apply. An autopsy of a failed marriage it contrasts the giddy honeymoon beginning with the sad denouement after dysfunction has devastated the groundwork of hope and newness. When we first meet Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) they are approaching middle age. Actually with his balding head and the cigarette dangling from his lips he looks like hes already there. Better dressed and with a greater care for her appearance she still shows the fading bloom of youth. They share a young daughter who loves them both and isnt aware of the tension between Mommy and Daddy. As the film progresses the already strained relationship begins to come apart at the edges as a one-night getaway for Dean and Cindy turns into anything but a romantic vacation. With their marriage approaching its breaking point they remember how it all began - their first meeting the heat of early sexual encounters Deans introduction to Cindys family and the courthouse wedding. What happens in between and how the couple detours from promising beginning to wistful end is not explicitly detailed but there are enough clues to provide a sense of what the deterioration entailed. Annie Hall despite being a lighthearted love story is disliked by some romantics because it lacks the one element to make the fantasy complete the happy ending. Such a caveat applies here although under no circumstances could Blue Valentine be categorized as a comedy. Its a drama and one of a particularly challenging sort. Like all good dramas it makes one consider how aspects of the characters lives and relationship might be like (or unlike) the viewers. Director Derek Cianfrance working from a screenplay he co-wrote with Cami Delavigne and Joey Curtis allows us to appreciate the cute moments of the early relationship but only after their joy has been filtered through the knowledge of what is to come. Blue Valentine is not a complete downer but it glares unflinchingly at the reasons underlying the collapse of Dean and Cindys union. Blue Valentine is driven by dialogue and fueled by performances. Theres a great deal of intensity in the acting and some of the confrontations between Dean and Cindy are difficult because of the amount of feeling brought to their roles by Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Both characters although flawed are sympathetic and there is no physical abuse in the relationship to stack the deck one way or another. We can see both sides and theres pain and blame to go around. Gosling and Williams play well off one another. They are strong respected thespians with Gosling having earned a deserved Oscar nomination for Half Nelson and Williams having given one of the best under-the-radar portrayals in recent years for Wendy and Lucy. Here they are in top form. Most importantly they provide the personality continuity necessary because of the non-linear and fragmented structure of the narrative. The Dean and Cindy at the chronological beginning of their story are the same people as at the end even though both have fundamentally changed in the ways in which they relate to one another. To an extent Blue Valentine has fallen victim to its distributors financial difficulties. Unable to give it the kind of backing they once lavished upon less deserving productions the Weinsteins have pushed it into a limited number of theaters with minimum marketing. Its not out of the question that Gosling and Williams will be accorded Oscar nominations - their performances linger in the minds of anyone who sees the movie - but Harvey lacks the deep pockets to properly support his film. Blue Valentine received a little free publicity from the MPAAs initial decision (reversed on appeal) to award an NC-17 rating even though theres nothing in the movie deserving of such a restrictive certification (the sex scenes are no more racy than those in dozens of R-rated mainstream features). If nothing else that may have generated some prurient curiosity about the movie. Whatever the motivation for seeing it however Blue Valentine deserves to be seen. The cumulative experience leaves an aftertaste that although not bitter is too strong to be easily washed away. Thats the mark of a worthwhile motion picture.

While the opening of exquisite dramas ""Blue Valentine"" and ""Rabbit Hole"" in Denver today is a function of the way indie distributors roll out movies (starting on the coasts then moving into other markets in hopes of good critical buzz) it also says something about the good the sad and the ugly of contemporary movie culture. For instance what are the studios opening this weekend ostensibly the start of the new movie year? The superhero buddy flick ""The Green Hornet"" and the marital buddy comedy ""The Dilemma."" The first is awful. ""The Dilemma"" I have hopes for. Or maybe its a soft spot I love Vince Vaughn and Kevin James and trust director Ron Howard. But like so much of the fare outside of awards season these films seem like evidence that studios are content to abandon adult moviegoers the rest of the year. ""Blue Valentine"" and ""Rabbit Hole"" have emotionally brave performances especially by their heavily tasked leads -- Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams; Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart. Both display telling writing and a love of craft. A month before Valentines Day ""Blue Valentine"" comes on like a bittersweet cautionary tale. A dog goes missing near a well-traveled road in Queens N.Y. The resulting loss becomes the catalyst to a greater one in Derek Cianfrances slow-burn of an out-of-love story. Gosling and Williams are Dean and Cindy. Shes a nurse who once wanted to be a doctor. Hes a house painter who seemed never to have had a career ambition. He smokes. He drinks a bit too much too early. But hes a loving dad to Frankie (Faith Wladyka) and in his way a dedicated husband. But his way may not work for Cindy any longer. ""Blue Valentine"" moves back and forth between the couples increasingly frustrated present and their lovely if complicated beginning six years earlier. Dean is the romantic in this tale. He falls for Cindy when he sees her in her grandmothers room at an assisted-living facility. Hes there not because he has family. Hes visiting a man whom he moved into the apartment across the way. Dean may be aimless but his heart is true. Gosling makes him decent and sympathetic. Written by Cianfrance and longtime collaborator Joey Curtis ""Blue Valentine"" grasps Deans soul better than it does Cindys. Scenes with her grandmother and her parents provide hints about why she may be suspicious of love. Not all of her decisions and moods ring authentic yet Williams is such an attentive performer that she makes them compelling. Dean insists they take a trip to a motel. Its a bright idea born of desperation. Rife with yearning and rejection graphic intimacy and furious ache the motel scenes offer wrenching images of a train derailing. The Ramp;B find ""You and Me"" by Penny amp; the Quarters adds yet another layer to the couples anguished hope and broken promises. ""Rabbit Hole"" directed with grace and surprising humor by John Cameron Mitchell is a delicate tale that shares a great deal of the hurt of Robert Redfords ""Ordinary People."" It takes us down into the dim purgatory of two still-grieving parents. Its been eight months since Becca and Howie Corbett lost their 4-year-old son. They are beginning to take different routes to what may or may not be recovery. And as often happens they are being gently left to their mourning by the world that must go on. Beccas sister Izzy (Tammy Blanchard) announces sheepishly that shes pregnant. A family friend has never summoned the courage to call Becca though it is clear that she and her husband once visited frequently and have children similar in age. Its as if a friends grief could plunge you into your own dark place. David Lindsay-Abaire adapted his Pulitzer Prize-winning play for the screen. And ""Rabbit Hole"" is a more evocative piece for getting out of a one-room setting. A neighborhood takes shape. The leafy road the Corbetts live on is upscale but not ostentatious. At night their house -- a big handsome Victorian -- takes on an amber glow the hue of nostalgia. Frank G. DeMarcos cinematography captures space and place with elegance. Miles Teller plays Jason a quiet teen whom Becca begins to stalk then befriend. The reasons become clear over time. Becca is not the only one who establishes a complicated relationship outside the couples sphere of sorrow. Howie and Becca attend a support group for grieving parents. Sandra Oh portrays Gabby who along with her tight-lipped husband is a group veteran. Becca hates the group. Howie and Gabby become compatriots. The often incomparable Dianne Wiest portrays Becca and Izzys mother Nat. She too knows much about the loss of a child. But lessons come hard and slow -- the better to grow -- in this elegiac work. ""BLUE VALENTINE"" R for strong graphic sexual content language and a beating. 1 hour 54 minutes.

Comments click to enlarge Blue Valentine Recommended Rated R  114 minutes  2010 Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling tear up the screen as mismatched lovers shown in alternating sequences as a giddy young couple forging a much-compromised emotional bond on their earliest dates and then years later as bitterly divided spouses with a young daughter. Theyre just getting by on his wages as a boozy house painter and hers as a nurse and his close intuitive relationship with the little girl seems to be the only glue holding it all together. In a desperate move husband and wife retreat for a romantic evening alone in a crummy hotel with theme rooms; theirs is the ""future room"" a garish space-age pad and--wouldnt you know it?--the future arrives. The performances are so gripping that the movie works despite its diagrammatic structure which focuses on ironic rhymes between past and present and omits the entirety of the couples marriage.

The Weinstein Company Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in ""Blue Valentine"" (The Weinstein Company) You always hurt the one you love."" So goes the oldest song in the world. A timeless refrain gets a new verse in ""Blue Valentine"" an almost unbearably bittersweet love story starring two of todays best actors and orchestrated by a director whos attuned to past masters.Its no disservice to say that Derek Cianfrance has taken some cues from the improvisational style of John Cassavetes. The handmade aesthetic underscores the voyeuristic intensity of the emotions. But much of the honor here belongs to the virtuoso soloists Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Individually they strike the grace notes of fully rounded characters; together they interact with the contrapuntal complexity of a real couple. They meet when furniture mover Dean shepherds an old gent from Brooklyn to a retirement home in Scranton Pa. where Cindy is visiting her grandmother. Like the rebel that his name invokes Dean is a loner with a secret reserve of tenderness which we see in a street-corner serenade that is my favorite movie moment of the past year. The sometimes confusing chronology shifts between that swooningly romantic first date and a final day of reckoning long after Cindy has surrendered her dream of med school to raise a daughter and dog with her unambitious alcoholic husband. A chance encounter with Cindys long-ago boyfriend a former wrestler with whom she shared a pivotal tryst precipitates a drunken feud in a fantasy hotel that Ingmar Bergman could only have imagined on morphine.Although its set in sooty present-day Pennsylvania the film invokes both the look and the spirit of 70s cinema when shoestring psychodramas like ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Last Tango in Paris"" were sometimes branded with an X rating. And its true that the movie is both emotionally violent and sexually explicit. Yet these scenes from a marriage are crafted with such attention to detail and overarching honesty that ""Blue Valentine"" touches the heart. Entertainment If you go Blue Valentine Jan 10 2011 (...)

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jan. 07 2011 800AM EST Last updated Thursday Apr. 11 2013 1130AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Country USA Language English Fully embracing its title Blue Valentine opens with a lost dog before moving on to the lost marriage. En route along lifes bumpy road a dissatisfied woman vies with her contented man love eroded duels with love sustained happier moments in the past contend with suffocating hours in the present and two superb actors etch an unflinching portrait of a young marriage doomed never to grow old. The portrait is painful to watch because it refuses to do what fiction (including the fiction we all concoct) typically does to fact create a soap opera and assign blame. Here everyone is flawed but no one is culpable; here chaotic drama never makes that reassuring leap into instructive melodrama.So if life is not a lesson to be learned what is it? In this version the answer is harrowingly simple Its the passage of time amid a swirl of changing circumstances. To an essential romantic like Dean (Ryan Gosling) that answer is impossible to accept a pill far too bitter to swallow.Not that he looks like your stock movie romantic not with his tattooed arms and perpetual cigarette and fondness for a wake-up beer. Still this high-school dropout doesnt lack intelligence or sensitivity or a steady job. Dean is a good father to a daughter he adores and a devoted husband whose feelings for his wife are the same as the instant six years ago when his eyes lit up. He loved Cindy at first sight; he loves her still. His is the ""ever-fixed"" love of the sonnet that does not ""alter when it alteration finds.""Hers isnt. The love that Cindy (Michelle Williams) felt for him was just as real but not as deep. It was a product of circumstance and circumstances change. The film is structured to measure that change repeatedly flashing back and forth from the past to the present from romances bloom to its current state.During that interval Cindy has grown out of her teenage confusion away from her abusive father and into a successful career as a nurse. That meaningful work allows her for the first time to define herself as something other than a pretty face and a pert body. By contrast Dean still toils at a menial job that is just a means to the days blissful end - when he comes home to that pretty face and pert body. For him theyre a large part of who she is and what he loves.For her his love once felt comforting and childlike in its purity; now it seems childish and limited and blind to ambition. Consequently the scenes in the past filmed by director Derek Cianfrance in expansive medium shots drip into the present through a pair of vastly different filters. The couple share the same fond memories - his wooing her with a ukulele her tap-dancing in delight - but to Dean they are a hopeful continuation and to Cindy a sad study in contrasts.These differing perspectives collide dramatically when he invites her on that most desperate of marriage-saving forays - a nights getaway at a motel. As Cianfrance works his camera in claustrophobic close-up they gather in the tacky ""Future Room"" (yes the symbolism creaks a bit) where a reluctant Cindy infuriates Dean not by depriving him of sex but by separating it so mechanically from love. This sequence is electric in its emotional charge and rare in film the explicit nudity is crucial - it speaks powerfully to the naked divide between them.The performances are as raw as the characters. As the figure of constancy Gosling has the more sympathetic role and takes full advantage underscoring everything thats likeable about Dean - his loopy humour his kind heart his failed but sincere efforts to understand his wifes discontent. Yet Gosling refuses to play the guy as a simple victim; instead he lets us see how constancy can also be a case of stunted growth of an inability to explore or evolve.Of course its Cindy whos the force of transformation here which gives Williams the much harder task of depicting a good woman who does right by herself by doing wrong to a good man. Thats quite a challenge but she rises to it brilliantly especially in the segments set in the troubled present where Williams keeps two antithetical emotions in precarious balance - a tender empathy and a steely resolve.But that inner balance is bound to topple - the heart cant maintain it. In this marriage as in so many others its the internal battle the struggle with ones own warring emotions that exacts the greatest toll and prompts those famously resigned words that leave victory indistinguishable from defeat ""I cant do this. I cant do this any more.""Blue ValentineDirected by Derek CianfranceWritten by Derek Cianfrance Joey Curtis Cami DelavigneStarring Ryan Gosling and Michelle WilliamsClassification 18A Report Typo/Error Follow us on Twitter GlobeArts Comments Print /License AA In the know Report on Business In tough job market highly educated feel the squeeze Obituary Robert-Ralph Carmichael created the art on Canadas loonie News How a Dudes Club in Vancouver is helping homeless men feel human again Report on Pokemon Canadians love it a Pokemaster is crowned Werner Herzog is puzzled Life How do I keep peace in the family when money comes up?

It can wear a mountain down to a pebble. And what it can do to two people in love is a theme as eternal as mankind. The heart-wrenching ""Blue Valentine"" examines a failing marriage by folding the demise of the couples dreams into their heady days of tenderness passion and promise. Bright-eyed youth and bedraggled adulthood alternate in a sad spectacle beautifully and sensitively portrayed. Cindy (Michelle Williams) is a careworn nurse and the reluctant authority figure in a home that is verging on slovenly. Dean (Ryan Gosling) is a house painter who loves his low-responsibility job because it gives him time to play with their daughter Frankie (Faith Wladyke). Cindy would prefer it if he didnt leave all the responsibility for discipline on her shoulders. And if he didnt start drinking early in the morning one of the perks of his career according to Dean. The cold space between them (dynamically sculpted by ace cinematographer Andrij Parekh) is charged with tension. When their eyes meet they carom away like billiard balls. In a bid to relive the good old days he books a night in a fantasy motel in the spirit-killing tellingly named Future Room which resembles the set for a soft-porn sci-fi movie. Their bad day which began with the family dog vanishing does not end on a note of triumph. How did this unhappy couple ever get together? The film slips into reverse to show the couple as vibrant twentysomethings and the twists of fate that enabled them to meet. Younger Dean is a kind romantic mover living in Brooklyn. Cindy is a college student hoping to attend medical school. Their paths cross in a nursing home where she visits her grandmother as he helps a new arrival settle in arranging the old mans tattered memorabilia with compassion and care. Dean is bowled over by bright elfin Cindy. The more practical of the two she is dubious until his persistence warmth and willingness to clown for her batters down her reserve. Their flashback scenes feature warm-hued intimately composed frames where the camera holds them close as a hug. But even their blissful moments foreshadow trouble. On their first date Cindy soft-shoes for Dean while he strums the ukulele and warbles ""You Always Hurt the One You Love."" The moment when he proposes protectively cradling Cindy after a troubling hospital visit the couple are visibly on two different wavelengths their understated nonverbal cues belying what they say to each other. Director Derek Cianfrance gets maximum value out of his stars two of the very best actors under 40. Goslings Dean is a three-dimensional creation a fun-loving young man who never reaches full maturity. As Cindy Williams is a more sharp-edged character but one whose impatience and disappointment are entirely understandable. These are people who could have made great partners. But probably not for each other. BLUE VALENTINE  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating Rated R for graphic sexual content language and a beating.

Blue Valentine (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Blue Valentine (R) Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams give knockout performances in this heartrending love story. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez The Miami Herald1/12/2011 Editor rating 3.5 Love hurts -- on the way up when youre in the throes of a new romance and the ache is delirious and exciting and filled with anticipation and on the way down when the feeling simply isnt there anymore when the pain is corrosive and searing and you just want it to end. Blue Valentine director Derek Cianfrances insightful heartrending exploration of the beginning and end of a relationship shows us the rapturous start and bitter hurtful fizzle of the relationship of a married couple Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams). The middle portion -- six years worth of living -- is left for you to imagine. Cianfrance who also wrote the screenplay with Cami Delavigne and Joey Curtis doesnt take sides in this portrayal of a crumbled marriage. Alternating without warning between the past and present (you can tell the time lines apart by Goslings hair line) the movie opens as the couples young daughter (Faith Wladyka) frets about the family dogs having run away. Immediately the disconnected way in which Dean and Cindy relate to each other hints at impending doom Hes oblivious to her dissatisfaction; she tries to pretend everything is all right. Gosling turns Dean into a most curious creature -- a tender loving father who seems to harbor a potential for great violence You fear what could happen if he were to lose his temper. Williams keys into Cindys emotional and physical exhaustion through sheer body language This is a woman weary of her life but fighting to find a way to remain engaged. Shes not quite ready to walk away but shes oh so close. In hopes of saving their marriage Dean comes up with the idea of spending a romantic night at a tacky motel. The hail-Mary desperation of the plan doesnt become clear until halfway through the date when the couple has already drunk way too much and started to say too much. The mood in the room becomes suffocating unnerving You are witnessing the implosion of a marriage and its a sad discomfiting thing to behold. In startling contrast Blue Valentine periodically cuts away to the past beginning with the moment Dean and Cindy met. For him the love came at first sight. She needed some courting and time. But not much. On their first date when Dean serenades her with an Elvis tune and she dances for him the movie captures a beautiful thing The precise moment when two people connect romantically - the moment when two souls bond as one. Such flashbacks make Dean and Cindys current situation all the sadder. Hes still madly in love with her and doesnt understand what happened. Shes baffled that he cant recognize her dissatisfaction and unhappiness. The more fervently they argue their cases the worse the situation becomes. There are no bad guys in Blue Valentine no possible solutions to an untenable standoff. Dean and Cindy share the fault for allowing their flame to flicker out then lashing out with anger and blame. With the exception of one brief clunky scene (an unnecessary flashback in which we meet Cindys boorish dad) there isnt a moment in the entire film that doesnt feel genuine -- that doesnt show compassion and empathy for a devoted husband and father who is too easily contented and for a wife and mother who finally decides her disillusionment is too heavy to bear.

While Cindy has blossomed into a woman with opportunities and options David is still the same person he was when they met and he is unable to accept either Cindys growth or his lack of it. Innovatively structured the narrative unfolds in two distinct time frames juxtaposing scenes of first love and youthful sexuality with those of disenchantment and discord. Director Derek Cianfrance Running time 200 Release Opened Jan 7 2011  Editorial Review Love from start to finish and back againBy Ann HornadayFriday January 7 2010Theres a moment in ""Blue Valentine"" when its searing drama and spontaneous vagrant beauty come into devastating focus. Michelle Williams who plays a wife mother and medical assistant named Cindy sits alone in a Poconos hotel room while her husband Dean (Ryan Gosling) knocks on the door to get in. The camera remains motionless but the audiences attention zooms in as Cindys agony plays across her face Worn down by a claustrophobic marriage and too many dreams deferred shes a woman shocked to find herself at this particular place at this particular time wondering how the hell shes going to get out. Williams expresses all of that without saying a word which testifies to the artistry of writer-director Derek Cianfrance who with ""Blue Valentine"" makes an astonishing debut. On paper the film sounds like a downer a portrait of a marriage unraveling even as the couple revisits the happier days of their courtship. But Cianfrance is a filmmaker alive to the rough beauty of even the deepest pain. Like John Cassavetes before him Cianfrance is a director willing to take his actors - and by extension the audience - to emotional and even physical extremes allowing them to create a world on screen that possesses all the volatility and ragged ends of real life. The results can be almost unbearably harrowing but also deeply cathartic as viewers create their own meanings within Dean and Cindys singular downward spiral. It wasnt always this way for the young couple. Although early scenes in which a tense Cindy prepares breakfast for Dean and their young daughter Frankie (Faith Wladyka) suggest that life at home hasnt been happy for a while soon we see Deans flashback to when he first laid eyes on Cindy - at a nursing home where she was visiting her grandmother and he was working for a company moving in a resident. Cianfrance uses subtle visual cues to toggle between the promising past and the dead-end present filming the flashbacks on warm 16-millimeter film and photographing present-day scenes on chilly digital video. What was once Deans charming footloose approach to life has now paled for Cindy who harbored bigger ambitions for both of them. At one point she suggests he try to find a job where he doesnt have to drink a beer every morning before going to work; he retorts that hes lucky to have a job where he gets to drink a beer every morning before going work. Can this marriage be saved? Thats the operative question throughout ""Blue Valentine"" and its a tribute to Gosling and Williams that they create such recognizable sympathetic characters that the audience actually cares. Neither emerges as demon nor angel in this story - in fact filmgoers will want to make sure they save time after the movie to engage in their own armchair therapy session where Cindys abusive home life and Deans self-sabotaging can be plumbed for their myriad implications. ""Blue Valentine"" possesses just one awkwardly staged over-the-top moment when a character arrives unexpectedly at the others workplace with explosive results. But thats the only scene that doesnt ring wincingly true in a film that otherwise unfolds with unforced observant ease whether in capturing the tremulous giddy moments of first love or its grim death rattle. For a movie dedicated to lifes most melancholy moments of loss and self-deception ""Blue Valentine"" is an oddly exhilarating experience if only to witness two of the screens finest actors working at the top of their game to the depth of their souls.Contains strong sexual content profanity and a beating.

"Color this dying marriage Blue - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Color this dying marriage BlueBlue Valentine a 3 starsJanuary 07 2011|By Michael Phillips | Movie criticSet in Scranton Pa. and Brooklyn N.Y. ""Blue Valentine"" depicts a working-class marriage hanging by threads of resentment contempt and love a very tricky braid to unravel. At its best the drama captures little bits and pieces of a relationship the telltale signs and clues to its undoing. In the end it sympathizes more with the wronged childlike husband than with the numbly exasperated wife. At least thats the way its written; as performed thankfully it turns out more intriguingly. None of its limitations has to do with Michelle Williams who brought such straight-shooting truth to everything from ""Brokeback Mountain"" to ""Wendy and Lucy."" Here she plays Cindy a nurse who harbored dreams of becoming a doctor. Shes married to Dean a heavy-drinking sweetheart who makes a living painting houses. Deans by far the showier role played by Ryan Gosling an actor of considerable emotional resources and a nagging showboaters instinct to dazzle his way through a partially or largely improvised scene. But its Williams you never question who makes every detail and close-up and impulse natural. Shes spectacularly good. The movie directed and co-written by Derek Cianfrance begins with a search for a lost dog. Cindy apparently is at fault for not locking the gate. Its Dean who reassures the couples preteen daughter (Faith Wladyka) that their pet has ""moved out to Hollywood to become a movie dog."" We sense the daughter has become in effect neutral territory in her parents cold war. Early on in ""Blue Valentine"" just when many in the audience may begin wondering about how these people got here we slide into our first flashback to six years earlier in Brooklyn (Cianfrance and his excellent cinematographer Andrij Parekh shot the present-day scenes on high-def digital video contrasted with the flashbacks shot on softer warmer 16-mm film.) The director has characterized the film as a love story in the flashbacks and a tragedy in the present and the way the two halves are spliced together intentionally answers some questions and leaves others dangling. In the present Dean and Cindy leave their daughter for a night with Cindys father (an emotionally abusive screamer played well by John Doman) and head off for a night at a ""theme"" motel. There in the eerily blue-soaked ""Jetsons""-style room they drink despair try to reignite what they once had. In the flashbacks some of which are nicely observant and indirect and others heavily underlined ""Blue Valentine"" gives us the story of how they met how Cindy got pregnant how amiable directionless Dean always felt outclassed by the love of his life. The movie caused a fuss late last year when it caught an NC-17 rating for sexual content in particular for one brief scene of implied oral sex. ""Blue Valentine"" was later re-rated sensibly down to an R. The movie also has gained some notoriety for the intense rehearsal period the actors underwent and for Gosling (at one point during a scene shot on the Brooklyn Bridge) apparently taking some major-league chances at a great height working without a net. During Cindy and Deans first date Williams and Gosling perform an impromptu duet (she tap-dances he plays the ukulele and sings) to ""You Always Hurt the One You Love."" In this scene everything good and less good about ""Blue Valentine"" comes together. Its charming. Yet Deans strangulated falsetto (he has to ""sing goofy"" he says if hes going to sing at all) feels like an audition piece. Did they have to pick a song freighted with quite so much ironically heavy-handed meaning? And yet Watch the way Williams watches Gosling and the way she makes you believe shes falling hard for someone sneaking up on her affections. ""Blue Valentine"" will strike some people as no less directionless than Dean though it struck me as most affecting precisely when it chooses to hang out in a fly-on-the-wall way with these ordinary people. The best of it plays like an acting exercise that serves the intimate often bruising relationship at the core. Gosling seems to be pulling from an impressive bag of performance tricks Williams from a deeper well drawn from life. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating R (for strong graphic sexual content language and a beating) Cast Ryan Gosling (Dean); Michelle Williams (Cindy); Faith Wladyka (Frankie); Mike Vogel (Bobby); Jen Jones (Gramma); John Doman (Jerry); Ben Shenkman (Dr. Feinberg) Credits Directed by Derek Cianfrance; written by Derek Cianfrance Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne; produced by Jamie Patricof Lynette Howell and Alex Orlovsky.

Blue Valentine review Sad but among the best 1 / 5 Back to Gallery Blue Valentine Drama. Starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. Directed by Derek Cianfrance. (R. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Americans puritan or libertine conservative or liberal tend to look at the world in moral terms. When we hear a news story or are confronted with an issue and especially when we make a movie our reflex is not to think ""Here is something interesting"" but rather ""This is right and this is wrong and heres why."" This tendency is so ingrained in us that we dont even notice it Youre sitting on your front porch and someone jogs by. You dont think ""Theres a person jogging"" but rather ""Thats what I should do."" Or ""Look at her showing off."" This American predilection which is neither good nor bad has resulted in movies that are grand social documents (""Schindlers List"" ""No Country for Old Men"") and also in lots of dumb action movies. But its certainly a rare thing when an American film escapes the moral-lesson pattern ... which leads us to the extraordinary and beautiful ""Blue Valentine."" One of the saddest and best films of the past year it tells the story of a collapsing marriage interspersing it with episodes from the couples courtship. Making movies about marriage is difficult - the alchemy of marriage is so elusive that even the mechanics of our friends marriages are mysterious. Thus the reflex to approach a marital story in easy moral terms is especially pronounced. But when you leave ""Blue Valentine"" you dont walk out thinking Ryan Gosling was right or that Michelle Williams was right. Rather you think about life and what happens to people. Related Stories Blue Valentine The movie shows a woman who has fallen out of love with her husband even though he is a loving man and even though he is worthy of love. At the same time we see why she would fall out of love with him - and why if we were her we wouldnt want to be married to him either. What do we expect of a spouse? ""Blue Valentine"" makes us ask that question. When we meet Dean (Ryan Gosling) he is a man about 30 with a receding hairline and a clueless mustache. He is in his housepainter clothes and smokes constantly but when we see him interact with his adorable daughter we know that he has a lot of warmth and kindness. This impression is confirmed when we meet him years earlier working for a moving company. He is spontaneous full of fun and wit but he also has a rare empathy in someone young When he moves an old man into a nursing home he takes pains to arrange the room in a personal way. Spontaneously without any fuss or sense of his own virtue he sees this sick old man as a human being with a life and a history. Meanwhile Cindy (Michelle Williams) as she approaches 30 has the more demanding job as a registered nurse specializing in womens health. When Cindy looks at Dean she sees a man who is not growing just growing older. When he takes her out his hands arent washed and the destination is a seedy hotel. He wants nothing but what he has to be a husband and father. He has no struggle with the world no visions of conquest and no ego pushing him forward. And because of these traits which some might see as virtues he is boring to live with and an embarrassment to his wife. Perhaps its just not manly to want nothing - and not sexy to have ones identity so completely defined by ones relationships even with family. Derek Cianfrance directed and co-wrote the film in a way that allows for a variety of interpretations. In any case we see both sides and feel equally for both characters. The sex scene which almost earned the film an NC-17 rating is both necessary and agonizing - pained rejection on one side visceral revulsion on the other. If the film has a flaw its that it flashes back once too often upsetting the rhythm at the finish and making it feel a trifle too long. But in a film of this depth and sensitivity thats a minor concern. The acting is exemplary. Gosling brings a preternatural understanding of people to his performance and Williams is amazing in the way she keeps trying to deny emotion and conceal emotion even as shes showing us. Theres a moment in which they dance together and its clear even as shes pretending otherwise that she has to get over her disgust just to go through the motions. Incidentally both actors went the extra mile and gained 15 pounds for the contemporary scenes. This was not enough to make them fat but enough to make them lose their youthful glow which was important. The loss of that glow is so much of what ""Blue Valentine"" is about. -- Advisory Sexual interludes strong language drug and alcohol use.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + ""Blue Valentine is a time-bomb marriage movie. You know from the third scene. Cindy (Michelle Williams) is getting herself ready for work and her daughter Frankie whos 3 or 4 ready for school. Her husband Dean (Ryan Gosling) insults the instant oatmeal shes made. Then along with Frankie he proceeds to pick out the raisins and slurp them off the table.In another movie something with Adam Sandler or a Wilson brother maybe Cindy might find this charming. But ""Blue Valentine aspires to high solemnity. Cindy is close to being through. She wanted a man. She married an aardvark. How long until she leaves? And as the film which Derek Cianfrance directed and co-wrote makes its way to the end of its second hour it becomes an acutely stylized slow-motion marital accident. You either want to call AAA or roll your eyes.That largely depends on whether you believe the filmmakers know what theyre up to. Cianfrance has a capacious hungry eye. The camera treats every possible shot as a wide canvas. Most of the film is set in parts of Queens Brooklyn and small-town Pennsylvania where Cindy works as a nurse and Dean does a little of this and a little of that; right now its house painting. The visual high point is a motel suite tinted in a lunar blue and done up as a space station. In one of the movies many cumbersome approaches to irony its called ""the future room.Cianfrance (its pronounced ""SEE-in-france "") shoots in a realist style meaning the camera spends a lot of time waiting for Williams and Gosling to behave until the negative chafing produces a fire. The problem is that there isnt enough material to do them many favors which is odd since three people including the director are credited with writing the script. The story of this relationship alternates in time between bristling courtship and weary demise. We see the couple come together and watch them fall apart. The collapse is part of an exercise whose spiritual instructor is John Cassavetes. Gosling makes Dean a casual alcoholic. Young adulthood turns Cindy humorless. As a couple they stammer and shout and push into each other just as Ben Gazzara and Gena Rowlands did for Cassavetes and Albert Finney and Diane Keaton did with ferocity in Alan Parkers ""Shoot the Moon.The relationship here doesnt ever seem real. Williams appears too together to find herself married to such a mess of a man. Goslings screw-up is a cute weird troubled guy. You date him for a year then throw him back in. Guilt and desperation are what bind these two and the movie knows that thats a shoddy recipe for love. In giving us the beginning and the end the film omits the crucial middle. Cindys face has gone hard and Deans hairline has ebbed. And we can speculate that these years were just as full of raisins being slurped from the table. But speculation does not an argument make. Dean and Cindy have lasted this long because his one heroic act makes her feel like she has to stay. Women make this mistake in life but life is what this movie lacks. ""Blue Valentine feels young (Cianfrance is only 35) but has none of the ideas or risks of youth. It wants an old soul without spending much time in church.All the movies good style goes to waste on a not terribly compelling conceit and loosely sketched characters. Some of the acting feels improvised. But given the number of scenes that culminate in obscenities and the volleyed repetition of lines (Williams says something; Gosling says it back as a question) the limits of improvisation are reached early and often. Otherwise the spontaneity feels whittled away by too many workshops.Williams whos a marvelous interior performer has a few startlingly true moments here like when Cindy furtively wipes her mouth in the motel shower after Dean kisses her. But she doesnt appear as comfortable with the realism assignment as she has in say Kelly Reichardts ""Wendy and Lucy. Sharp or singeing might be Williamss best mode. Her work as a smoldering apparition in ""Shutter Island stuck with me more than what shes done here. What I remember most about ""Blue Valentine is the back of her head.Gosling steps right into the Cassavetes idea. He can be bluesy. But here that crypto-Queens drawl the Methody deliberateness the all-purpose angst trendy accoutrements of handsomeness (mustache biceps expensive-looking shades) can also suggest membership in an all-barista Marlon Brando tribute band. Theres something of that in this performance -- hipsterism misdirected. Cianfrance is so helpless to stop his star he could be the drummer. At some point Dean begs Cindy for guidance ""Tell me what to do. Please sir take off your sunglasses.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com. Follow him at www.twitter.com/wesley_morris.

"Movie Review Hearts break in Blue Valentine | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMovie Review Hearts break in Blue ValentineA marital breakdown is brought heartbreakingly to the screen with Oscar- worthy performances by Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling.Michelle Williams left and Ryan Gosling in a scene from Blue Valentine.  (AP PHOTO / THE WEINSTEIN COMPANY)  By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Jan. 6 2011 Blue Valentine (out of 4) Starring Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling. Directed by Derek Cianfrance. 113 minutes. At the Scotiabank. 18A We say that a marriage ""breaks"" when couples are no longer united but often its not as decisive as that. More commonly dissolution is a process of erosion of love of trust of patience. One or both partners finally decides they can no longer tolerate the other perhaps repelled by the very things that so attracted them at the start. I had a friend once who described her divorce as ""putting down the suitcases"" shed been symbolically carrying for her child-man husband. Its this slow marital wearing down that Derek Cianfrance brings so heartbreakingly to the screen in Blue Valentine aided by rich performances from Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling that have deservedly attracted Oscar buzz. Titled for an old Tom Waits tune one whose lyrics lament ""half forgotten dreams / Like a pebble in my shoe"" the film proceeds in what feels like real time but with no obvious beginning or end. Its a latticework of moments happy and sad. Mostly sad. Cianfrance shows us enough of the good times to infer what brought Williams Cindy and Goslings Dean together even though it was immediately evident that their personalities didnt mesh. Cindy is a practical woman with a full-time job in medical care serious ambitions for the future -- maybe shell become a doctor? -- and no time for frivolous things or silly people in her dull suburban neighbourhood. Dean is a dreamer satisfied with unskilled jobs and his ever-present bottle of beer and pack of smokes. When he plays with his young daughter its hard to tell which one is the real child. Dean vows hell never grow up ""Im not getting old . . . its for suckers."" So what brought Cindy and Dean together? Its hard to say -- the movie only hints at it -- but likely it was his heart-on-sleeve sincerity a welcome change from the bullying jocks Cindy was used to. Her violent father made home a place she was anxious to leave. How could she not fall for someone who serenaded her with his ukulele warbling ""You Always Hurt The One You Love"" like a foreshadowing Tiny Tim? And it was love between Cindy and Dean at least for a time. The sex was obviously good (although not as ""blue"" as that ridiculous recent U.S. censor battle implied) but more than that they shared a common purpose. You could see it in their eyes and in the way they held each other. Something happened but not suddenly. Cindy and Dean added a few years and pounds and gained a beautiful daughter named Frankie (Faith Wladyka) but they also lost a few dreams. Perhaps just Cindy did. She tired of Deans immaturity lack of direction and addictions. She began wondering if she was ever really in love with him ""What does it feel like when you feel in love?"" she asked her grandmother (Jen Jones) who replied that she wasnt sure about romance herself. Dean just kept on believing. He tried to rekindle old fire by booking a room in a motel with a sci-fi theme and the cheesy name of ""The Future"" ""Pack your bags baby were going to the future"" But there was to be no forward motion for Cindy and Dean only memories scattered like a box of faded valentines. Working from a script he co-wrote with Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne with major input from Williams and Gosling Cianfrance lays out the rise and fall of Cindy and Dean as if it were found footage. Flashbacks of the happier past were shot on forgiving 16mm film. The harsh present was recorded digitally making the deepening frowns razor sharp. Williams and Gosling work shopped their roles moving in together for a spell to feel like a real couple. They paradoxically are a great pair which makes the attrition of their attraction all the more painful to watch. They dont know what really happened any more than we could or should. Neither of them are saints. Dean needs to smarten up but Cindy could stand to loosen up. Hes too hot. Shes too cold. Theyre just people in other words. Theyre like those sad blue valentines in that Tom Waits tune sent by a woman to her former flame ""Theyre insisting that our love / Must have a eulogy."" ww The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsSquadGoals Will Smith Margot Robbie on Suicide Squad red carpet in TorontoToronto mayor John Tory showed up to thank the stars for shooting the summer tent-pole movie in the city.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Blue Valentine with Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Dec. 31 2010 130 PM Blue Valentine Not safe for first dates. By Dana Stevens Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in Blue Valentine Within the first 15 minutes of Derek Cianfrances wrenching romantic drama Blue Valentine (the Weinstein Co.) you know more about the intimate day-to-day details of its characters lives than you do by the end of most movies. Cindy and Dean (Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling) are a married couple in their late 20s or early 30s. They live in rural Pennsylvania with a daughter of about 5 (Faith Wladyka). Cindy an obstetrics nurse loves her job and is good at it but at home shes snappish discontented and perpetually overworked. Dean is a house painter ambitionless but reasonably content in his work a volatile husband and a goofy but besotted father. Cindy and Deans marriage is in trouble--not because of an affair or abuse or addiction (though both drink more than they probably should) but just because of the passage of time and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. They dont laugh at each others jokes; they dont respect each others parenting decisions; they dont have sex. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. At the end of one particularly miserable day Dean decides that what he and his wife need is a night in what Cindy ungraciously but accurately describes as a ""cheesy sex motel."" They leave their daughter with her grandfather (a dour John Doman) and check into the ironically named Future Room a windowless dump wallpapered in reflective foil where they spend a night drinking dancing and having epically bad marital relations. Intercut with these painfully naturalistic present-day scenes are flashbacks to a more hopeful time five or six years earlier when the two first met fell in love and after a series of split-second decisions that were either romantic or stupid or both wound up at the altar. Advertisement Blue Valentines ingenious temporal structure is one of the best things about it. The nested time frames complement and explicate one another without any obvious signposting; there are no legends at the bottom of the screen reading ""six years earlier"" no chunks of expository dialogue setting up the couples circumstances. In fact until you get used to the back-and-forth structure its hard to keep track of whether a scene takes place in the past or the present. But thats not a flaw; the viewers sense of slippage between timeframes echoes the couples experience of being doomed to repeat patterns established long ago. From the beginning the fault lines in this relationship are discernible Cindys rigidity and secretiveness Deans hypersensitivity and refusal to accept loss or change. Yet neither partner emerges as the villain; theres no abusive Ike Turner here no abandoning mother a la Kramer vs. Kramer. Watching as these two well-meaning and decent people try and fail to stop treating each other horribly was one of the most painful experiences Ive had at the movies this year. Dean and Cindys climactic (and in part physical) confrontation at her workplace is as hard to sit through as the arm-sawing scene in 127 Hours. Blue Valentine isnt perfect There are a few narrative details that feel contrived a little pat. A subplot that establishes Cindy as the child of an emotionally abusive father makes its point too neatly. The pretty plaintive score by the Brooklyn indie band Grizzly Bear at times panders to our emotions especially in the flashback scenes--we would understand that these two were falling in love without acoustic-guitar reinforcement. But the movie gets so much else right from the careful hand-held camerawork by Andrij Parekh (who uses different film stock and color palettes for the two time periods the past in warm golden 16-millimeter the present in icy blue digital video) to the sensational performances by both leads. There are so many things to love about Michelle Williams face. I dearly hope that on that still far-off day when shes no longer a young woman she never does anything to it. Its a beautiful face but beautiful in a normal non-movie-star way and so wonderfully expressive and unguarded. She plays this tired disillusioned chronically angry woman without a trace of actorly vanity. Its a performance noteworthy not just for its intensity but for Williams ability to communicate inner experience at a micro-level of detail. You can pinpoint the precise moments when Cindy realizing that no one is watching lets her face slacken into its default expression of despair. Goslings performance if I had to compare them is just a shade less subtle than Williams but hes also superb as the thin-skinned loudmouthed heartbreakingly loyal Dean. More impressive than either performance is the space the two actors create between themselves. We wouldnt feel we knew them so well by the end unless we believed they knew each other. In an unorthodox rehearsal process that resembles John Cassavetes or Mike Leighs Cianfrance co-habited with his leads for a month sharing chores in the Pennsylvania house where they would shoot the present-day scenes. He also reportedly filmed them in takes up to 40 minutes long often with the actors improvising dialogue from a template Cianfrance provided. (The director has mentioned his plans to leak some of this cutting-room-floor footage on the Internet; heres hoping it ends up as an extra on the DVD.) Before its release the MPAA threatened to slap Blue Valentine with a box-office-killing NC-17 rating but producer and distributor Harvey Weinstein threw a tantrum and got it reversed to an R. For once Weinsteins drama-queen behavior seems justifiable. (I particularly loved Weinsteins defense of a flashback scene in which Dean performs oral sex on an ecstatic Cindy ""That was good acting. Maybe too good."") My suspicion is that the MPAA was uncomfortable with Blue Valentines depiction of sex not because it was too graphic but because it was too frank and dark and sad. Were used to (non-pornographic) movie sex signifying only one thing ""Then they had sex and it was awesome."" Dean and Cindys drunken coupling in the Future Room is decidedly not awesome--its shot through with open hostility and even moments of questionable consensuality (though when Dean comprehends the degree of his wifes revulsion he desists). Maybe a new MPAA rating should be invented for Blue Valentine NSFFD ""not safe for first dates."" This is a marvel of a movie but in the interest of perpetuating the human race Id counsel dewy young couples embarking on lifes journey to check into a sex motel instead.

By Peter Rainer Film critic December 29 2010 Save for later Saved Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Watching two of our best young actors go at it for almost two hours ought to be more rewarding than ""Blue Valentine"" starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams as Dean and Cindy a couple falling out and in and in and out of love. Director and coscreenwriter Derek Cianfrance traces the rocky terrain of their relationship from coy courtship to marriage a daughter and nothingness. Dean is a charming working-class lout while Cindy a college grad works in a doctors office and pines for a better life. The films time structure is splintered into shards of past and present which is probably just as well - a strictly narrative chronology would make this wallow seem even sloggier.

Thats why...2011-01-06The Weinstein Company Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr TENDER MOMENTS Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling play a couple in Blue Valentine (Davi Russo) Blue Valentine Genre Romance Drama; Starring Ryan Gosling Michelle Williams; Director Derek Cianfrance; Release Date Wide 12/31/2010; Runtime (in minutes) 112; MPAA Rating R; Distributor The Weinstein Company Posted January 6 2011 -- 1200 AM EST Blue Valentine is about a marriage thats slowly if not quite surely falling apart yet the movie is every inch a love story. Thats why it stings so exquisitely. Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) have been together for six years with a daughter theyre devoted to but their lives are a mess. Dean a softhearted blustery screwup with a youthfully receding hairline is a freelance house- painter who likes the work because he can enjoy a beer at eight in the morning. He says so with a boastful grin. In other words hes trouble. Cindy a kindly beleaguered nurse who is looking to move up in the medical world is sick of his slovenly pursuit of pleasure his slipshod career options and his refusal to be an adult. At the same time we can see what shes drawn to Dean is sexy with a slightly saddened little-boy charm and hes forever working his way back into her good graces. Theyve turned the addict/enabler two-step into an elegant rehearsed dance. In one memorable sequence they take a romantic night off and go to a tacky theme motel where theyre booked into a room with lunar wallpaper and a sci-fi spaceship motif. In this dingy kitsch palace the two guzzle vodka and mess around (she asks him to get rough -- less out of nastiness than nostalgia) fumbling toward the moment when they can feel those old feelings they used to have. Trying to set the mood Dean puts on a scratchy old soul song. Its ""You and Me"" a curio from the 70s by Penny amp; the Quarters and all we have to hear is a few bars of its warbling sweet plea (""You and me/You and me/Nobody baby but you and me"") to know that its their song and that its a heartbreaker because the two probably havent felt that way in a very long time. As the tune goes on it sounds more and more achingly beautiful. It becomes the wistful ""our song"" of everyone in the audience. The young co-writer and director Derek Cianfrance works in leisurely long takes letting the sweet nothings the bitter battles the dying embers of romance play out before our eyes. From the start we may wonder How did a gentle sane woman like Cindy end up with a mate so ardently troubled? But Cianfrance has built that complication right into the movie. He cuts back in time to reveal how the two met folding the past right into the present. Dean wasnt always so addled and with his full hairline he was ruggedly attractive. Cianfrance stages each scene as another desperate piece in the puzzle of how a couple could find each other this innocently and then get this lost. At moments watching Blue Valentine is like being at the scene of an accident yet the power of the movie rests in how easy it is for almost anyone to glimpse them- selves in the elemental passions of these two. Blue Valentine is lushly touching and gorgeously told. By the time the film is over you may feel that you know every inch of these lives. Thats because Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams act without a net. The two have moments that make you melt like one where Gosling on what is basically the couples first date stops at a storefront to do an awful/endearing Elvis impersonation singing ""You Always Hurt the One You Love"" as he accompanies himself on the ukulele while Williams dances a happy little jig. You can see them spontaneously locking hearts. And both actors have moments that tear you apart like one set in the doctors office where Cindy works with Dean busting into the place to fight with her and everyone looking at him like hes crazy and us realizing that hes not crazy but that he may now be a prisoner of his rage too far gone to stop hurting the one he loves. Gosling plays Dean as a snarky working-class hipster but when his anger is unleashed the performance turns powerful. It becomes a scary study in the woundedness of defensive manhood -- Raging Bull meets COPS. Williams has the quieter role and maybe the trickier one Her Cindy has to make choices about how much her feelings for Dean are seriously worth and the choices keep changing. There are real demons here -- in him and in her too. Yet Blue Valentine wrenches us with its painful and tender understanding of how people with even this tattered a connection can lunge for love as if it were air.

The broken-love movie has to be as intricately conceived as the heist flick. ""Blue Valentine"" a small but shattering film that marks its writer-director Derek Cianfrance as an artist of real depth observes relationship dynamics at a molecular level welling with as much understanding as Ingmar Bergmans ""Scenes from a Marriage."" Dean (Ryan Gosling) a janitors son and career laborer has all he wants out of life a lovely wife Cindy (Michelle Williams) who to him can do no wrong and a little daughter to play with. Its immediately obvious though that something isnt right. When Dean and the girl Frankie sneak up on the sleeping Cindy as though re-enacting a breakfast cereal commercial she isnt even a little amused. Even as the story flashes back from the principals poisoned exhaustion to their sweetly tantalizing flirtation years ago it becomes clear that this marriage couldnt have worked and shouldnt have been attempted. It turns out that Cindy is a nurse who could have been a doctor that Frankie wasnt planned that Dean has wit and talent but no ambition. The film is an investigative report on everyones unhappiness. Even the dog has gone missing. On the surface then ""Blue Valentine"" is fairly routine indie drama -- depressive tightly constrained almost without brightness or levity. Yet it rises far above the expected on all levels as Cianfrances unforced acuity invests every detail with importance. And Williams and Gosling are exceptionally moving. Both of them probably have Oscars in their future though not for this melancholy work. His character -- outfitted within an inch of being a supporting player on ""My Name Is Earl""-- could easily have turned into a stereotype of a working stiff. Yet if Gosling chooses speech patterns that seem a little emphatically unlettered -- Dean failed to complete high school -- he works beautifully with the penetrating script (by Cianfrance Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne) to create a man of sudden talents unexpected acts of kindness and delightful surprises. He simply fatally doesnt want very much. When Cindy urges him to find a job that isnt so depressing he needs a drink in the morning he turns it back on her ""I have a job that I can drink at 8 oclock in the morning . . . this is the dream."" He likes who he is. She doesnt. She would like him to be someone else quickly. Cindy is prickly and at times a little cruel but its devastatingly clear that Dean is not the man for her and perhaps never was. She married him because of practicality and because he was sweet with a ukelele one dappled and perfect night. Without ever saying so ""Blue Valentine"" is centrally about class and class in America anyway is centrally about much more than income -- its about tastes and values as we see when Deans idea of a healing getaway means a cheesy lovers motel. It seems obvious that if Dean had arranged such a trip with cool irony instead of urgent eagerness Cindy would have accepted it in a larky spirit. And if Dean painted canvases instead of houses his lack of accomplishment wouldnt be an issue. American filmmakers largely avoid class which is fine because virtually all of them were well-born and tend to portray their inferiors as piteous comical or (especially when theyre minorities) as sprites whose magical simplicity can be used to cure the angst of therapy-needing professionals. ""Blue Valentine"" resists such glibness and makes us look deeper. Its not an easy film but the force of its compassion is equal to the strain of its sorrows. kyle.smithnypost.com Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next Boardwalk Empire star teen actors cast in final ...

When the rating was reversed this month--downgraded to an R without a single cut to the film--after Weinstein himself reportedly appeared in front of the appeals board armed with a ""200-page dossier of letters and arguments as well as 3000 tweets"" it didnt seem so cynical to cite the controversy as a work of genius. Back when Weinstein bought the film shortly after its Sundance premiere it was just another tough-sell film festival indie. Now on the eve of its release Blue Valentine is the movie that was both hot enough to rankle the censors and beloved enough to make them change their mind.To be sure anyone looking for porn here will be disappointed Blue Valentines stars only partially disrobe and though their couplings are frank theyre not explicit or gratuitous. In keeping with the rest of Cianfrances picture Blue Valentines sex is both unimaginatively blunt and frustratingly obscured.The story of how a couple travels from too-cute introduction to irreconcilable differences in just more than half a decade this divorce movie begins with a childs scream. Frankie the kindergarten-age daughter of Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams) discovers her dog is missing while mom and dad are still asleep (she in bed he slumped in last nights clothes in the living room). When Cindy later comes across the dogs corpse along the side of the road the parents decide to ship Frankie to her granddads house for the night so they can bury the family pet and figure out how to break the news to their kid. With a rare night off from parenthood Dean decides the time is right to cash in a gift certificate for a future-themed room at a pleasure hotel. ""Cmon lets get drunk and make love"" husband coaxes reluctant wife then unsubtly announces the evenings make-or-break potential for their marriage. ""Pack your bags babe--were going to the future.""They get drunk all right but it becomes clear that theres a scant supply of love left between them. There was once a surplus Cindys chance run-in with an ex-boyfriend at a liquor store on the way to ""the future"" touches off the first of many long flashbacks to Dean and Cindys early days which Cianfrance weaves through the film to the end ultimately dovetailing the couples wedding day with the last moments of their marriage. Dean was a working-class Brooklyn boy who caught a glimpse of Cindy a pre-med student in the process of disentangling herself from a long-term boyfriend and fell in love at first sight. Seen in halcyonic highly saturated flashback (as opposed to the generally low-contrast shades-of-blue present) Cindy and Deans relationship moves quickly from cloyingly quirky courtship ritual to a deep bond rushed by literal life-or-death drama and blinkered by lust. As past and present weave together the deeper Cindy falls under Deans spell in the past the more cruelly her present-day version rejects her husbands sexual advances.As is the case with other non-linear romances (the musicals Merrily We Roll Along and The Last Five Years come to mind as does Gaspar Noes Irreversible) the emotional depth produced by the juxtaposition of the naive idyllic beginning and the post-knowing crushing end is Blue Valentines raison detre. Its a gimmick but not necessarily a bad one In the films final act as the parallel tracks veer in wildly different tonal directions Cianfrances montage increases in fluidity and the crescendo it all comes to is effective if over-reliant on Grizzly Bears ethereal score. Its an improvement over early scenes when Cianfrances thesis on the evanescence of mutual adoration is too often spelled out in literal language.Even when transparently plumbing for depth Cianfrances film is frustratingly surface-bound in ways that reflect if not out-and-out misogyny then at least a lack of interest in imbuing his female character with the rich interior life and complicated morality he gives his male lead. Cindy is written as a cipher inexplicably veering from indifferent to Dean to purringly hot for him (and not just him--in an infuriating scene set in a womens clinic Cianfrance gives us just enough information about Cindys past to be able to write her off as a tempestuous slut) and then back to uninterested. Williams performs Cindys enigmatic hot-and-cold routine as blankness. At the films emotional peaks Cianfrances camera assumes Deans point of view getting extremely close to the actress as if thats the way to capture the inner life thats invisible to the eyes of both husband and lens.Do ""feelings just disappear"" as Cindy puts it at one point without a visible trace? If so Blue Valentine may be an accurate naturalistic portrait of what its like to be locked out of your lovers heart and head but in contrast to Goslings hyper-expressive Dean Cindys poker face reads as an imbalance. Its one thing that Dean has no clue who his wife really is but in a film that purports to study intimacy the filmmaker could give us more of a glimpse. Without it Cindy isnt just a heartbreaker--shes a villain.

(Weinstein Co.) Joe Neumaier Wednesday December 29 2010 400 AM Title Blue Valentine A married couples relationship is seen in flashback. With Michelle Williams Ryan Gosling. Director Derek Cianfrance (152). R Sexuality nudity language. At the Angelika; at Lincoln Plaza starting Friday.Halfway into ""Blue Valentine"" a work so beautifully acted and emotionally honest it is my choice for best movie of the year theres an amazing flashback scene you hope never ends.In it Cindy (Michelle Williams) a student at a community medical college is on a date with Dean (Ryan Gosling) a blue-collar guy who has just moved to Brooklyn from Florida.They ask each other if they have any talents. She can sing every Presidents name in order; he can play the ukelele. Then she dances as he strums and croons off-key -- and in a dimly lit doorway of a formalwear shop in the middle of the night they laugh and goof and fall in love.But it does end -- beginnings have to -- and were back to where this tough-minded yet melancholy film began in the present where Cindy and Dean are almost a decade into their marriage. Everyday stresses have worn them down. Theyre raising a 6-year-old daughter. Cindy is working all the time and frazzled. Dean is dedicated but burnt out from trying to keep them together.These moments -- some of which take place in a blue-tinted motel room theyve rented to get away from things -- are heavy with the recognition that somethings over.Director Derek Cianfrance who crafted the film over a 12-year period with co-writers Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne understands the rhythms of life of arguments and affection and reconciliation. As we see Cindy and Dean before they meet and during their courtship we like who they might become which makes what they are heartbreaking.Comparable to the films of John Cassavetes -- except Cianfrance adds an ethereal musical score by a Brooklyn band called Grizzly Bear -- ""Blue Valentine"" could be seen as the perfect antidote to Hollywoods usual empty-souled assembly-line romances. But that puts this tender intense perceptive film in company that doesnt deserve it.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

"Movie review Blue Valentine - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-EntertainmentMovie review Blue ValentineThe white-hot and the chilly gray of love are poignantly explored in a film that gives Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling room to behave like the rest of us.December 29 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling star in ""Blue Valentine."" (Associated Press )Derek Cianfrances ""Blue Valentine"" starring Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling is a beginning and an ending an intensely intimate rendering of love that limits itself to that first falling in and that last falling out. Without a middle the writers a Cianfrance Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne a have still put in everything we need to know about a relationship that is fraying faster than either Cindy (Williams) or Dean (Gosling) grasps. It is painful and moving to watch as they lose hold of the few threads still connecting them including 5-year-old daughter Frankie (a soulful young Faith Wladyka). That the specifics of the hows and whys of things are so unnecessary is perhaps what gives the film such a feeling of reality. In establishing the narrative like bookends the filmmakers have reflected the way most of us tend to remember failed relationships a the intensity of the first flame the darkness when it goes out. The ordinary nicks and cuts that actually wear things down to the bone fade into the background. Though the film sometimes frays around the edges too in Williams and Gosling Cianfrance has what he needs to keep us invested. The actors who have been doing their best work in personal films for a while now (""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Wendy and Lucy"" among those for Williams ""Half Nelson"" and ""Lars and the Real Girl"" for Gosling) give an almost sleepy languor to those early moments when breath catches often want is hot and heavy and laughter comes easily. But it is in the final days when things turn ugly and love dies scene by scene that Gosling and Williams prove what emotional heft they give their characters. The result is an unsettling portrait of marriage as failed enterprise and broken dreams the tears over the scattered shards hard-earned. What the filmmaker has understood best is that the conflict is as much about social class as love and in doing so has made a film that is more penetrating and salient than it probably set out to be. With cinematographer Andrij Parekh the filmmakers have given a gritty authenticity to life on the lower rungs of middle class where moneys always tight. A wide shot of an overgrown front yard a beloved dog that has gone missing a child wandering in the weeds calling her name is one of those classic opening scenes that uses both its simplicity and complexity to set the stage for all that is to come. Cianfrance keeps the story moving along shifting often between the couples early romance which is spun out of serendipity and five or so years later when everything including marriage has become predictable. All that back-and-forthing is less confusing than it might sound. Clarity comes not just because of changes in the look of things although the production team has done a good job of creating two distinct worlds. Its more the way the reality of the life Cindy and Dean have built together has settled into their bones a shes the nurse who wanted to be a doctor trying to make the best of it hes the house painter content with a day that starts with a beer and ends with some cash. There is a playfulness and hope that infuses their early days from that first meeting at a retirement home a hes one of the crew moving someone in shes visiting her grandmother a to the unplanned pregnancy that changes everything. Its a small encounter that sketches in a lot about the sort of people were dealing with here a basically good decent and with the best of intentions. The end stage is heavier. Everything shot tight rooms feel airless the booze slowing things down during a hotel getaway spent in the aptly named Future Room with its dark walls neon lights and rotating bed depression everywhere in their foundering try at rekindling the fire that once burned between them. Though much has been made of the sex scene that initially got the film an NC-17 rating (after a fight its now an R) the truth is The emotional bond the actors have forged throughout is what gives the film its intimacy. Williams Cindy doing a shuffling tap dance late one night on a city sidewalk accompanied by Goslings ukulele rendition of ""You Always Hurt the One You Love"" as Dean is as nakedly honest as any moment youll see in ""Blue Valentine"" and there are many of them. Cianfrances documentary background a dominated by his ""Battlegrounds"" TV series on basketball both street and world class a can be felt in the way he gives the actors room to move within the scenes. An instinct that if you keep the camera rolling you will not only get what you want but something far better than you expected. He stacked the cards in that regard by asking his actors to live in Cindy and Deans world for a while before shooting began a their house their budget. By using a sort of reality TV approach to Method acting the director found a different way to smudge the line between complete fiction and conceived reality. That meandering dialogue can be difficult to control and at times the film feels as if the director has stepped away from the vehicle leaving it to veer off the path. Still its an experiment that works more than it fails by giving Gosling and Williams both the motive and the means to create something extraordinary a valentine that actually says something true about being in love.

ABOUT THE MOVIEBlue Valentine    (out of four)Stars Ryan Gosling Michelle Williams Faith Wladyka Mike Vogel John DornanDirector Derek CianfranceDistributor The Weinstein Company Rating R for strong graphic sexual content language and a beatingRunning time 2 hoursOpens Wednesday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY ""Its no Cupids Cove"" says Ryan Gosling who plays Blue Valentines Dean an unambitious charmer. Hes referring to a cheesy motel room rented for a romantic getaway with his wife Cindy played by Michelle Williams. But he also could be talking about their marriage. Dean and Cindy are undeniably struck by Cupids arrow but it tears a painful gash in both of them. Gosling and Williams have the most palpable chemistry of any screen couple this year never striking a false note in this achingly tender tale of a love that implodes before our eyes. Dean is a sweet man who didnt finish high school but he has far more intelligence than that fact would imply. Cindy wants to be a doctor but her romantic life derails her ambition. TRAILER Get a peek at Blue Valentine INTERVIEW Michelle Williams keeps an open heart VIDEO Five questions for Michelle Williams PHOTOS See more pictures of Michelle Williams When Dean says to Cindy ""Lets be a family"" Williams eyes convey a complicated expression that is at once terrified hopeful and relieved. Barely 30 these are consummate actors giving masterful performances. Director Derek Cianfrance brilliantly charts the trajectory of their relationship by cross-cutting over a half-dozen years chronicling intimate details prosaic moments and devastating epiphanies. In a just world this bracingly honest exploration will not be overshadowed by the NC-17 rating originally given before it was changed to an R by the Motion Picture Association of America. To diminish this poignant film by focusing on a few graphic scenes -- all contextual and never gratuitous -- would be glaringly unfair. ""I never want to be like my parents"" Cindy tells her grandmother (a pitch-perfect Jen Jones) whom she regularly visits. ""I know they must have loved each other at one time. Did they just get it all out of the way before they had me?"" Cianfrance shoots with a naturalism that intensifies the storys authenticity blending blurry images and sharp details. As each scene juxtaposes or blends with the one before a simple story reveals its complexity. A despairing stab at lovemaking segues into the first joyous one; a passionate kiss at the height of their relationship switches to a bittersweet embrace at its depths. The screenplay is almost like a short story. Symbolism appears in song lyrics hotel names and incidental visuals. In a key scene Dean spots Cindy riding on his bus approaches her and ignites their romance. The camera pulls back to reveal a thin rainbow in the background. Ambient sounds like a rumbling train and an insistently ringing phone lend almost a documentary realism. Time shifts are accomplished by modifying the characters appearances. The younger Dean is bearded with a hopeful expression. Just a few years into their marriage he looks markedly different. Its not merely his physical transformation -- receding hairline mustache and glasses -- that stand out. He looks worn out by unhappiness. His playful antics with their preschool-age daughter Frankie (a wonderful Faith Wladyka) have a forced exuberance. Cindys physical evolution is more subtle. She goes from dreamy and open-faced to scowling. Dean and Cindy fell in love with a natural ease. The alienation of their affections happens less smoothly. Dean has developed a volatile temper and Cindy once lighthearted is a scold. Their marriage has become a heartbreaking dance of reaching out occasionally connecting but more often feeling rebuffed. Affection and anger vie for dominance. Its one step forward three steps back. During one of the sweetest scenes in their courtship Dean plays a ukulele and sings in a goofy voice You Always Hurt the One You Love while Cindy half dances. The choice of tunes was not left to chance. They first spot each other at a convalescent home. Cindy is visiting her grandmother and Dean is helping to relocate an elderly man. Dean scrawls a tersely romantic message on the back of his business card ""Give me a chance."" The heart of this beautifully mesmerizing film comes down to that simple entreaty. Love is all about chance. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

Discord Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams are a couple coming apart in the raw relationship drama Blue Valentine. Davi Russo/The Weinstein Co. Blue Valentine Director Derek Cianfrance Genre Drama Running Time 120 minutes Rated R for sex language and physical violence With Ryan Gosling Michelle Williams (Recommended) Going back and forth in time crossing strand over agonizing strand Derek Cianfrances Blue Valentine follows a volatile relationship as it flowers in the past and wilts in the present looking for clues about what went wrong. It sounds like the cruelest sort of dissection like pulling a butterfly apart by its wings but Cianfrance and his actors Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling have not made a cold or schematic film. They aim instead for raw emotional experience one thats full of insight into the ways a relationship can go astray but mostly feels like a slow-motion punch to the gut. Taking a page or maybe a full novella from John Cassavetes kitchen-sink melodramas Blue Valentine amplifies the intensity a notch or two above the expected; it leaves the actors looking bruised and exhausted like Peter Falk and Gena Rowlands at the end of Cassavetes A Woman Under The Influence. Sometimes the effect is too mannered -- Gosling in particular has a weakness for repeating phrases like Brando or De Niro at their most Method-ic -- but in an independent landscape blighted by Sundance quirk Blue Valentine unfolds with a directness thats bracing even shocking. As it opens the marriage between Cindy (Williams) and Dean (Gosling) is essentially over but Dean either doesnt know it yet or perhaps just isnt ready to acknowledge it. In a last-ditch effort to save their relationship the couple checks into one of those tacky theme hotels for the weekend hoping to rekindle a flame long since extinguished. Their room is space-themed with a circular rotating bed affixed to a frame alight like an old Enterprise control panel but the dark windowless place is more suffocating than playful. Their attempts at intimacy are worse than obligatory; theyre forced and joyless a reminder that the body isnt detached from the heart. The Fresh Air Interview Ryan Gosling Fully Immersed In Blue Valentine The structure allows Cianfrance to contrast Cindy and Deans tortured present-day lovemaking sessions with those of better times when they shared ecstasies freely and openly. (And with a zeal that originally earned the film an NC-17 until the ratings board wisely reversed itself.) The passion between these young lovers is incandescent but even in the best of times Cianfrance finds the seeds of their destruction. Though Dean grows into a devoted husband and father to their 4-year-old daughter his chronic immaturity and lack of ambition is apparent from the beginning of the relationship. Cindy just chooses to look past it just as she does the marital discord within her own family. Because Blue Valentine announces itself as a breakup movie from the start the most tender and happy moments between Cindy and Dean tend to be among the most devastating too. Breakups naturally bring a couples romantic history rushing to the fore -- the mind plays back the ugly fights and missteps to say nothing of the sweetest memories -- but in showing us that history as it accumulates Cianfrance gives the film a heartbreaking resonance. Blue Valentine sets past and present on course for a collision and measures the full weight of its impact.

Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams give two of the most explosive and emotionally naked performances you will see anywhere. Just know youre in for a workout. Derek Cianfrance (Brother Tied) directs in a storm of feeling as if the movie was ripped from his insides. Maybe it was. It took the Brooklyn-based filmmaker a dozen years to get his film made.

Share Tweet Derek Cianfrances relationship drama Blue Valentine conducts a harsh unblinking autopsy on the doomed marriage of Ryan Gosling a heavy-drinking slacker much too comfortable with his complete lack of ambition and Michelle Williams a practical wife who comes to the bitter realization that she needs to grow old with a man not a boy no matter how impishly charming the boy might be. Its an emotionally claustrophobic drama played with frayed nerves and raw emotions and it serves as an unrelenting glimpse into relationship hell. It could easily have devolved into sweaty pretentious melodrama or ersatz John Cassavetes if Cianfrance and his actors didnt maintain perfect control over the material. In the latest of a long string of astonishing frighteningly committed performances Williams stars as a nurse who falls for amiable loser Gosling in spite of herself. Shes initially able to look past his rudderless existence but ultimately tires of waiting for the man-child she married to grow up. For Gosling Williams is his soulmate his everything; for Williams Gosling is good enough until he isnt. That imbalance proves fatal. As the couples relationship reaches a debilitating end game Cianfrance cuts back and forth between the agonizing finale and the dreamy romantic beginning to devastating emotional effect. Blue Valentine plays like a warped reverse-highlight reel of the most painful moments in a dying relationship It has the sting and sadness of real life. The effect is powerful yet strangely not overwhelming. Even at its most intense Blue Valentine never lapses into melodrama. The film made headlines when it was rather ridiculously saddled with a now-rescinded NC-17 for an ""emotionally intense sex scene."" Though it wasnt designed as such the NC-17 is still considered a mark of shame to many but Blue Valentines fearless candor and extreme emotional intensity should be a source of pride for everyone involved in this remarkable utterly wrenching film.

By Anthony Lane Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams in a love story for grownups.   Credit Illustration by PHILIP BURKE The first thing we see in ""Blue Valentine"" is a small girl standing alone in the grass crying out a name. Its a simple sight yet fraught with alarming possibility and that goes for the rest of the movie. Here is the tale of a man and a woman falling in and out of love something that happens every day to millions of people as if that were any consolation. "" Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all"" Tennyson wrote and instinct tells us to agree. But he was writing of bereavement--of a love cut off in its glory through nobodys fault. What if the love wizens and sours through everyones fault making the loss too bitter to endure? Who wouldnt wonder in a low moment whether the whole damn thing was worth it after all? The girl is Frankie (Faith Wladyka) aged about five the only child of Dean (Ryan Gosling) and Cindy (Michelle Williams). Frankie is calling for their dog which has run off and Cindys search for the wanderer strikes the first note of desperation in the film though hardly the last. When she arrives late for a school concert her eyes are wet; the news is not good and you want to know how Dean will break it to their daughter. ""Maybe she moved out to Hollywood and became a movie dog"" he says to her which is as good a working metaphor for death as I have heard. Its also a hint of how closely Dean is tuned to Frankie--more closely sometimes than her mother is. Together father and daughter lick the raisins from her oatmeal off the kitchen table (""Were eating like leopards"" he explains) which shows what a kid he is himself and what sort of laceration would result if they were parted. As if in response to this worry the movie then parts company with itself. One moment were watching Frankie being dropped off with Cindys father (John Doman) for a sleepover. The next we see Dean looking spry and chipper applying for a job with a firm of house movers. Whats happening? It takes a while to realize that this is a flashback to the period before he and Cindy met--the era in which like all lovers they feel in retrospect that they were arrowing toward each other. But notice what Derek Cianfrance the director and co-writer does not do. He supplies no title saying ""Five years earlier"" or whatever and arranges no major shift in tone aside from a slight cranking up of the colors. In other words the past is not so different from the present and what should be horribly confusing about ""Blue Valentine"" becomes its most rending aspect; namely that as we swipe backward and forward through the rest of the film we cant always tell the now from the then. Given that one means rage silence and failed sex and the other meant a flurry of eagerness and lust you would imagine the gulf to be unbridgeable; but it doesnt look that way and the bridging is the saddest thing of all. Nothing out of the ordinary happens in ""Blue Valentine"" and that together with the vital untrammelled performances of the two leading actors is the root of its power. Dean and Cindy try to mend their marriage by taking a short child-free romantic break--a sure sign that the damage is now beyond repair. They go to a motel with a choice of fancy suites Cupids Cove or the Future Room. They pick the latter which with its revolving bed and planetary decor is a tacky dated vision of a future that will never be. ""Dont lets ask for the moon. We have the stars"" Bette Davis said at the end of ""Now Voyager""; but she was eons away from the cratered desolation of these two and she didnt have a guy with smoke on his breath arms covered in tattoos and a head full of vodka trying to muscle her into submission on the floor. Not that the past was a paradise; when Cindy runs into an old boyfriend (Mike Vogel) we are spirited further back to the time when she got pregnant by him with harrowing results. If you want to see an entire abortion debate dramatized in a few minutes every angle is represented here from the brutishness of the conception to the delicate courtesy of the doctor and the sudden terrified realization of the woman that she cannot and must not withdraw her child from existence. All of this demonstrates that ""Blue Valentine"" is that rare creation a love story that doesnt shy away from sex ignore its consequences or droop into pointless fantasy. The result is adult entertainment as it should be in other words right down to the laugh that Cindy lets out in her leaping delight when Dean goes down on her. Needless to say the M.P.A.A. which cannot bear very much reality took fright at all this and hobbled the movie with an NC-17 rating which was overturned only after a concerted challenge. It is now an R-rated picture and rightly so although you have to ask In what circumstances would you take a teen-ager let alone a child to see it? Who on the verge of growing up would wish to learn that the first heady bloom of rapture is doomed to rot and fall and that even someone as devoted as Dean will wind up pleading to his paramour with a kind of bullish grovel ""Tell me how I should be""? And yet we have the ukulele--a dumb little strummer that Dean holds high on his chest as he serenades his twin soul. This is long ago in the springtime of their relationship but the night is dark and chilly and Cindy in a sloppy red sweater dances in the doorway of a shop with a garlanded heart hanging behind her. ""I have to sing goofy in order to sing"" Dean says and then he starts ""You always hurt / The ones you love / The one you shouldnt hurt at all."" His voice as promised is a strangulated tenor like Roy Orbison with a bad cold and her dancing is no prettier. But somehow from this silliness Cianfrance strikes a deep chord of longing and the sequence slips into place beside other foolish trifling moments that last forever like Audrey Hepburn giving us ""Moon River"" in ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" and noodling away on her guitar. The director clearly knows what he has here; the tune is repeated over the closing credits and the films first trailer was composed of little else. We can forgive him such excess I think because his whole story dances to the tune and the pain of the song. ""Blue Valentine"" true to its title is overwhelming proof that hurt is the bedfellow of love. For anybody who already knows that or has been the cause of it the film may be very hard to take. I saw it months ago and I cant forget it but Im not sure that Ill be seeing it again. Just to ramp up the festivity ""Rabbit Hole"" introduces another couple trying to claw their way out of despair. In ""Blue Valentine"" we never actually saw the hinge--the instant or the indefinable period at which the lovers lives swivelled from a pleasure to a grind. They probably didnt notice it themselves. For Howie (Aaron Eckhart) and Becca (Nicole Kidman) the husband and wife in ""Rabbit Hole"" there is no such mystery; everything broke when their four-year-old son was killed. We meet them not in the midst of the horror but in its frozen aftermath eight months later and the smartest thing about the script--adapted by David Lindsay-Abaire from his own play--is the patient difficult drip of information. Not for a while can we work out exactly how the child died or even what his name was. Its as though the world around the survivors with its flow of helpful conversation had seized up altogether. Against all expectations you approach ""Rabbit Hole"" with a heavy heart and leave with a lighter one. This is not because the director John Cameron Mitchell reaches for some sappy smiling-through-tears brand of closure but precisely because he refuses to tread the path laid out by dozens of TV movies on a similar theme. I feared the worst as the opening sequence showed Becca bedding a tiny plant in her herbaceous border only to have it trampled on and snapped by a clumsy neighbor. Emotional symbol alert New life in peril From then on however more subtle tensions come into play with scenes that could have been merely morose swerving into unhappy slapstick Becca nearly spun off her feet by a revolving door or slapping another mother in the supermarket for not treating her kid to some candy. Over the years Kidmans watchful self-calibration as a performer has grown so controlled that she often skitters toward mannerism but her role here is a good fit because Becca is herself defined by a brittle (and finally fruitless) urge to control--to tamp down an eruptive grief. Better still Kidman is paired with Dianne Wiest who plays Nat Beccas mother and who has yet to enter a movie without donating her warmth and her cracked sweetness. The sight of Nat getting tipsy in a bowling alley is at once endearing and awful because it makes you wonder about the sorrows that she too has been required to drown. Does Mitchells movie ever fly with the furious velocity of ""Blue Valentine""? Not quite. Its hard to fault the ensemble work in ""Rabbit Hole"" but the film bears lingering traces of its grounding onstage whereas Michelle Williams and Ryan Gosling simply climb into their characters and take off--I for one was far too consumed by their dramatic destination to stop and assess how great the acting was. One glance at the cast list of ""How Do You Know"" the new James L. Brooks comedy and you might well be hoping for something similar. The film boasts Reese Witherspoon as a national softball player at the dusk of her career Owen Wilson as a baseball pro with busy loins Paul Rudd as a klutz and Jack Nicholson as his expansive father. Everything looks primed for civilized amusement but somewhere along the way the laughs dropped off together with the question mark in the title. The cinematographer is Janusz Kaminski whose appointed task is to creep in close to Reese Witherspoon the better to gloat over her caramel tan and the azure shine of her eyes. (When she played opposite Paul Newman in ""Twilight"" twelve years ago it was like an intergenerational blue-off.) She also has to wear twirling girly dresses in red white and blue as if planning to downsize from softball to cheerleading. All of this has an infantilizing effect which seems cruel for a character who is thirty-one--although to be fair nobody in the film not even Nicholson behaves as a grownup should. People keep gulping their lines snatching up their cell phones like high-school gabblers and trotting in and out of rooms to announce a change of mind. They swim into one anothers ken and then veer off again into the solo arc of their itchy ditherings pausing only to pass weird superfluous judgment on what has occurred. ""Good phone call"" says one. ""Nice visit"" says another. Bad movie  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review Love Among the Ruins Its the dense high-wire performances of Williams and Gosling that power Blue Valentine. By David Edelstein Published Dec 23 2010 ShareThis (Photo Davi Russo/Courtesy of the Weinstein Company) Derek Cianfrances Blue Valentine opens as ominously as any horror film. The chitter of insects is loud. The family dog has gone missing. The father Dean (Ryan Gosling) directs his daughter Frankie (Faith Wladyka) to check inside the doghouse and as the little girl gets down on her knees and puts her head into the darkness you might fear that gnarled claws will spring out and yank her in. (Chitter chitter chitter ) The camera hovers anxiously over Dean as he gazes down the hill on which his house is perched at the road vanishing into the distance. In the kitchen Frankie yelps with displeasure at an unwelcome change in her oatmeal. Her grim-faced mother Cindy (Michelle Williams) has made the mushy quick kind and used water instead of milk. The camera shivers as if picking up on Cindys angry vibe. Something bad is obviously coming the death of the child in a car crash; the return of the dog now hungry for human flesh; a nuclear holocaust. After a start so unnerving its almost a relief to learn that Blue Valentine is merely about a couple with issues. They are to be fair big issues perhaps insurmountable and its a measure of the actors power that Cianfrances neurotically in-their-face camera is an annoyance instead of a deal-breaker. The film is a very rough ride with the shock absorbers removed. That dog has symbolic weight. So does an overnight stay in a gimmicky theme motel in which Dean intends to rekindle the relationship. They are ensconced in the blue-lit Future Room which seems suitable only for android mating. Too much cheap vodka adds to the non-fun. When Cindy locks herself in the bathroom the drunken Dean calls out Open the door and then Open the door He keeps it up until youre almost yelling in unison. The film is not an arms-length experience. Cianfrance has a temporal gimmick that prevents Blue Valentine from becoming a long variation on Open the door He cuts back and forth between what might be the couples dissolution and its charged but charming inception. Those flashbacks in context elicit marvelously complex emotions suggesting that whats right and liberating at one point in a persons life can be wrong and constricting down the road. John Doman who played a self-serving police officer on The Wire needs only a few lines to make Cindys dad a nasty suffocating presence. No better is her crude jock boyfriend (Mike Vogel) and his oops-I-meant-to-pull-out callousness. Cindy who is prepping herself for medical school is suddenly pregnant in enemy territory. Its no wonder that Dean the blue-eyed musician who loved her at first sight and is kind and makes her laugh and dreams of a family seems heaven-sent. It is only in hindsightand hindsight is our vantagethat his lack of ambition (and a high-school degree) makes him less than ideal for a young woman who wants to be a doctor that his jokiness has a compulsive aspect that his pursuit of Cindy carries a whiff of obsession that those baby blues can turn scary. Gosling is a hot-dog actor of unlimited potential who has clearly watched Taxi Driver too many times. His Dean is more evolved than Robert De Niros Travis Bickle with the sense not to take his Cybill Shepherd to a porn house. But when he snaps he has the same wiriness the same jabbering vocal patterns. For many reasons Dean loses stature and recedes while Cindy a killjoy in the early scenes becomes the movies true protagonist. Blue Valentine was scheduled to film shortly after Heath Ledgers sudden death and Cianfrance opted not to recast but to wait for Williams to recover. I found it hard to watch her without thinking about the couples breakup and the impact of his death on Williams and their child. For this movie though that isnt a problem. It might be the opposite of a problem. Always an actress with see-through defenses she is here under the handheld cameras tight scrutiny a study in fear in the strain that comes with endless self-protection. Williams is holding it inand holding it inso when her Cindy cant anymore the effect is momentous. In three scenes her performance is seismic. The first is a flashback and perhaps the films high point in which she and Gosling duck into the doorway of a closed store and he induces her with much prodding to tap-dance while he plays a ukulele and warbles like Tiny Tim. Her surrender is infectious and enchanting. The second is when she goes for an abortion but halts the procedure. Its then in an astonishing shot through venetian blinds that Cindy hurries to Dean and he rises to the occasion and makes her feel for once in her life safe. The last is the moment when she realizes definitively that she isnt. 1 2 Next Share this story...

We meet Dean (Ryan Gosling) a house painter and morning drinker and his wife a nurse named Cindy (Michelle Williams) as their relationship is unraveling; the end seems near. But as so often is true in life coming to terms with an end means revisiting the beginning and that is what this solemn beautifully acted film does cutting back and forth in time to allow Cindy and Dan -- and us -- to take the true measure of what is being lost. (See TIMEs Top 10 movies of 2010.) We begin with their young daughter Frankie (Faith Wladyka) looking for their missing dog who apparently got out a gate Dean assumes Cindy didnt shut. The scene in which Cindy later spots the dog dead by the side of the road is a demonstration of just how miraculously talented an actress Williams is (and what a good director shes working with here in Derek Cianfrance). We notice the dog just as she does through her windshield. Then our perspective shifts to the passengers seat and we see Williams in profile; her expression barely changes but her features nonetheless register the pain over losing the pet her guilt and her resentment over Deans accusation all in one fell swoop. Cianfrance uses the dogs death to draw a line in the relationship sand narratively -- not at all as clunky as it sounds -- and then goes back in time. (See TIMEs 2010 Holiday Movie Preview.) Their first meeting can be directly attributed to the kindnesses they show to older people. In Cindys case its a deep devotion to her grandmother (Jen Jones) who she frequently visits in a rest home in Pennsylvania. Her Grandma speaks honestly and openly particularly about the dead husband she did not really love -- ""he didnt really have any regard for me as a person"" -- and through her directness gives her granddaughter the gift (and curse) of high standards. Dean is part of a New York area moving crew installing Walter a wizened old man and all his possessions in the same rest home. Dean crushed by the old mans lonliness decorates the new room with Walters photographs and souvenirs. On the way out he catches a glimpse of Cindy. Walter is the excuse for Dean to return to the rest home but the goal is to find this girl again. Dean firmly believes that his sex is the more romantic one. Women go off looking for Prince Charming he tells his buddies at the moving company and then settle for the guy with the best job who can take care of them. Whereas men he says resist and resist ""Until we meet one girl and we think Id be an idiot if I didnt marry this girl."" Cindy meanwhile is emerging from a complicated relationship -- to say any more would spoil the movies quiet slow revelations -- and the ways in which Dean is good to her carry more import than they might have at another point her in life. The couple are not brought together under false pretenses but they are rushed -- and in that rush see only each others good qualities. Whats particularly special about the screenplay which Cianfrance co-wrote with Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne is that the flashbacks carry a subtle point of view with them not immediately apparent that alternates between the two -- Dean and Cindy arent just remembering what once was but how they were at that time what was shaping the connection they forged. They are charming and passionate together in their early days but watching their beginnings we come to see why that love found so quickly might have run out. Rejected by Cindy in a present-day shower lovemaking scene Dean is cast back to time when she did want him in just that particular intimate way. His flashback if you want to call it that includes a recollection of the day he smitten told one of his work buddies ""Maybe I seen too many movies you know? Love at first sight."" We imagine his mind searching for the weaknesses in the fabric that formed their relationship the holes he knows are there now. Speaking of intimacies these would be the scenes that originally earned the film an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of Americas ratings board -- a rating revised on appeal to a much more suitable R. But lifted or not that NC-17 hangs over the movie like a lascivious promise; it might be good to know if thats what youre looking for that we dont actually see that much. A woman and a man having sex a few brief times mostly with at least some clothes on providing some peeks of flesh -- nothing frontal or scandalous. We see less skin than we did in say Love amp; Other Drugs but what we do see is the raw emotion of a couple having sex in very different states of mind. The scenes cut so close to the emotional bone that you can understand why they might cause a panic amongst MPAA boardmembers although of course its nothing to be afraid of just the realism of love in its varied forms.

He plays a working-class underachiever she a college student.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted October 15 2010Michelle Williams needs to make a movie that doesnt have a dog tragedy in it and she needs to make a movie where she doesnt look like the weight of the world is crushing her soul.Blue Valentine an overwrought American indie from writer/director Derek Cianfrance is not that movie.Opening with the cries of a little girl and ending with strangely out-of-place fireworks and a boppy Grizzly Bear tune Blue Valentine - shot in and around Scranton with a side trip or two to Brooklyn - offers a fractured portrait of a couples relationship the meet-cute; the shaggy charming courtship; the big problems and small grievances on the way to marriage a daughter and then what?Ryan Gosling whose twitchy enervated acting style worked to his benefit as a crackhead teacher in Half Nelson is Dean a working-class underachiever who meets Williams college student Cindy when hes moving a mans belongings into a retirement home. Her grandmas room is across the hall. Dean and Cindy exchange words. He asks to see her again.And as fate (and Cianfrances script) would have it he does. Wearing a hoodie and a cocky grin Dean woos Cindy on a bus.Blue Valentine jumps around flashing back to Cindy and Deans early days together then up to the present then back to some other time the other boyfriend the fight at the doctors office where Cindy works the drunken night of sex at a motel. (Blue Valentine was slapped with an NC-17 for those scenes; if you want to see the film before the MPAA appeals and the inevitable trims nows your chance.)Theres a loose vA(c)ritA(c) vibe here and times when both Williams and Gosling root down deep to deliver something resonant and true. But this modern-day kitchen sink drama (theres even an ""Im so out of love with you"" scene right by a kitchen sink) is ultimately too painful too labored to care much about at all.Contact movie critic Steven Reaat 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

Sept. 15 Tracy Wright Ryan Gosling and more Add to ... The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday Sep. 15 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Aug. 23 2012 423PM EDT Comments Print /License AA The following short reviews of films opening on Wednesday Sept. 15 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival are by James Adams James Bradshaw Guy Dixon Rick Groen Liam Lacey Gayle MacDonald Dave McGinn J. Kelly Nestruck Johanna Schneller and Brad Wheeler. The star ratings are out of four. You Are Here Daniel Cockburn (Canada) 3 STARS ""Have you heard about the dictionary for masochists?"" asks a character in You Are Here. ""It has all the words in it. Theyre just not in any particular order."" That maddening notion roughly speaking sums up Canadian filmmaker and visual artist Daniel Cockburns first feature film. Less a narrative than a series of interlocking thought experiments You Are Here is thoughtful clever confusing unsettling and perhaps just a little bit frustrating. Cockburn is a devotee of Jorge Luis Borges whose mind-bending metaphysical leanings are apparent in the films various threads such as a laborious experiment showing how the mind understands language or an archivist (played masterfully by the late Tracy Wright) desperately trying to make sense of a breadcrumb trail of found objects. It all feels as though a dash of the surreal has been woven into moments of banal human experience to see how far reality bends before it snaps. J.B. Sept. 15 5 p.m. AMC 10; Sept. 17 745 p.m. AMC 2; Sept. 19 415 p.m. AMC 10 Blue Valentine Derek Cianfrance. (USA) 3 STARS The ghost of John Cassavetes hovers over this tough-minded portrait of a working-class couples marriage starring Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. The film cuts back and forth over several years marking the dissolution of their relationship. Gosling plays Dean a housepainter and Williams is Cindy a medical aid. The scenes in the present (shot in intense close-ups) show us an immature husband and a wife who has retreated into a shell struggling through the rituals of a marriage while the past scenes - shot with more perspective and coherent focus - show the affection and tenderness that brought them together. Dean and Cindy can be frustratingly obtuse but Gosling and Williams bring a painful authenticity to this portrait of intimacy turned to alienation. L.L. Sept. 15 615 p.m. Ryerson; Sept. 15 12 p.m. Varsity 8 Modra Ingrid Veniger (Canada) 3 STARS Modest and appealing this Before Sunset-style drama follows 17-year-old Lina (Hallie Switzer) and a male school friend Leco (Alexander Gammal) who accompanies her on a trip to her familys hometown of Modra Slovakia. Both teenagers are nursing emotional wounds - shes just been dumped by her boyfriend his mother has recently died. Old World scenery and music and a non-professional cast give the Slovakian interlude the quality of a breezy travelogue (marred by the precious inclusion of an enigmatic mute magician). The easy natural performances from the young actors are refreshingly realistic They come across as awkward curious empathetic and mostly a pleasure to hang out with. L.L. Sept. 15 830 p.m. AMC 3; Sept. 17 215 p.m. AMC 2; Sept. 18 515 p.m. AMC 2 The Bang Bang Club Steven Silver (Canada/South Africa) 3 STARS It is 1994 South Africa. Nelson Mandela has just been released from prison and all hell is breaking loose on the streets in the months leading to the end of Apartheid. Based on the true story of a group of photojournalists known as the Bang Bang Club for being in the thick of the gunfire its the story of four men who risked life and limb to show the world the wretchedness of a civil war that was ripping apart a country. Ryan Phillippe Taylor Kitsch and South Africans Neels Van Jaarsveld and Frank Rautenbach play the heroic foursome (two of whom won Pulitzers for their riveting photos) whose images shocked the world awake. G.M. Sept. 15 930 p.m. Roy Thomson; Sept. 16 9 a.m. Varsity 8 I Wish I Knew (Hai Shang Chuan Qi) Jia Zhang-ke (China/Netherlands) 3 STARS Jia Zhang-kes documentary on Shanghai commissioned for this years World Expo there employs interviews and painterly location shooting to tell a story of how Chinas most populous city was shaped over the past 70 years by a series of historical traumas including the Sino-Japanese War the Chinese Civil War and the Cultural Revolution. Similar in its use of oral history to Jias last film 24 City it gains momentum and its appeal to film buffs in the second half during a detour that deals with films set in Shanghai and takes us to exile communities in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Throughout actress Zhao Tao wanders through the urban landscape as a representative of the citys meandering soul. L.L. Sept. 15 945 p.m. Scotiabank 4; Sept. 17 5 p.m. Jackman A Screaming Man (Un homme qui cri) Mahamat-Saleh Haroun (France/Belgium/Chad) 3 STARS Modest but quietly powerful A Screaming Man (which took a jury prize at Cannes) begins with a middle-aged pool attendant named Adam a former swimming champion now a proud employee in a tourist hotel in Chads capital. When new owners decide to promote Adams assistant his adult son to his job hes left with the humiliating job of gate-keeper. As the army pushes the citizen to contribute either money or sons to the war effort against rebel insurgencies Adam chooses to send his son. The initial calm of the film builds gradually until reports of war on the radio suddenly become an immediate reality. Throughout characters are artfully framed against their environment with the hotel pool as a kind of centre of calm and the desert outside the city as its war-torn opposite. L.L. Sept. 15 615 p.m. Bell Lightbox 2; Sept. 16 445 p.m. Isabel Bader; Sept. 19 6 p.m. AMC 6 Route Irish Ken Loach (U.K./France/Belgium/Italy/Spain) TWO STARS Veteran British social-realist director Ken Loachs new conspiracy thriller focuses on private security companies and the struggle of former guard-for-hire Fergus (Mark Womack) back in his hometown of Liverpool trying to find out the truth about the death of his friend Frankie killed on Route Irish between the Baghdad Airport and the Green Zone. When he is given a cellphone with incriminating evidence on it at the funeral Fergus begins to find out about the company they both worked for and finds his own life in danger. Full of fury and good intentions Route Irish is a disappointment unconvincing as a thriller and heavy-handed in depicting the dehumanizing effects of war. L.L.

The beguiling beginning and dismaying deterioration of a relationship are charted simultaneously in ""Blue Valentine"" an intensely acted minutely observed attempt to convey the arc of a romantic involvement. Onscreen continuously for two hours in various states of emotional extremity Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams dive into the deep end of commitment to their roles as young working-class parents and bring them fully alive. Director Derek Cianfrance whose ""Brother Tied"" played at Sundance in 1998 employs a close-up impressionistic style that has its pros and cons but on balance this is a meaty strongly realized dramatic work of considerable accomplishment. Name actors provide the film a serious profile but it will take a dedicated distributor to muscle this very far into the theatrical market. Shooting in intense closeups with long lenses and the Red digital camera system in the contemporary breakup scenes Cianfrance immediately conveys the impression of eavesdropping on real life. Dean (Gosling) a good-looking regular Joe rarely without a cigarette and a beer horses around at home with young daughter Frankie (Faith Wladyka) in a modest wooded Eastern neighborhood. Wife Cindy (Williams) whos naturally attractive but letting herself go seems sulky; life seems limited there is a cloud concerning their missing dog and Grandpa (John Doman) is on oxygen. On a quick grocery stop Cindy bumps into Bobby (Mike Vogel) an ex she hasnt seen in a long time who impudently asks if shes been faithful to her husband. Disgusted she later mentions the encounter to Dean who goes into a petulant snit. No matter what they discuss Dean and Cindy end up arguing; their dynamic is uniformly negative and destructive. Flashing back a few years earlier in material shot for greater depth of field and visual detail with a shorter lens and on Super 16mm a younger Dean (defined mostly by a fuller head of hair) happily takes a job with a moving company in Brooklyn while Cindy is a student with an eye on the medical profession with wrestler Bobby as her b.f. Dean and Cindy meet while helping people at an old folks home and Dean is genuinely funny and charming in courting a girl he quickly comes to love and desire as his lifelong mate. The film swings back and forth between the rising feelings of a developing relationship one complicated by an unplanned pregnancy and the downward spiral of its fracture. In the contemporary timeframe the couple go to a ""romantic"" hotel and while there is some upside to their night together Cindy is ultimately called upon to cut it short for work which leads to a giant blow-up. Cianfrance working with co-screenwriters Joey Curtis and Cami Delavigne and undoubted input from the actors has succeeded in creating a precise mosaic of a relationship from innumerable small details; moment to moment the film lives and breathes with emotional truth. The looming question however is whether or not it gets to the bottom of what went wrong between Dean and Cindy. Its clear that Cindy comes to feel that Dean will always love and be there for her and he is; hes also a good father. However he never matures displays no ambition and seems oblivious to the issue of how they might improve their lot in life which is terribly mundane. While all this is no doubt disappointing to Cindy she hasnt helped matters by retreating into a cocoon and despite a decent job she hardly seems more capable than her husband of helping to raise the family out of the doldrums. The film is so focused on charting the couples emotional fluctuations that even a slightly bigger perspective is never suggested; its difficult to pinpoint what went wrong or if there were roads not taken that could have prevented the sorry outcome. Scruffy-looking but handsome Dean reaches his full potential when he marries Cindy; he apparently assumes life can just go on from there without any particular planning or strategy. Cindy is similar in this respect but unlike her husband is dissatisfied with the stasis. Gosling and Williams interact beautifully and without a false note their deep immersion in their roles resulting in nothing but behavioral truths. Its also a muscular highly controlled piece of filmmaking with its photographic style carefully judged and the editing balancing both dual narrative tracks and quicksilver mood changes. Craft contributions are uniformly strong. Lensing was done in Pennsylvania with some location work in New York.
