Innocuous in the extreme and very poorly written even on the teen trauma-lite level on which it operates this latest Paramount/MTV Films co-venture is with its PG-13 rating a tad ""mature"" for the singers pre-teen fan base. Well its not ""Glitter"" but ""Crossroads"" is still an awfully lame bigscreen debut for pop diva Britney Spears. Innocuous in the extreme and very poorly written even on the teen trauma-lite level on which it operates this latest Paramount/MTV Films co-venture is with its PG-13 rating a tad ""mature"" for the singers pre-teen fan base and far too tame and pat to fulfill the more excitable expectations of the stars contemporaries. With Spears currently all over the place public awareness is high but whatever biz the film does will have to be over the opening weekend as subsequent falloff will be steep. Given her squeaky-clean-but-sexy image well-scrubbed looks and infallibly upbeat demeanor Spears ideal moment for screen stardom would seem to lie in the past -- 43 years ago to be exact She would have been perfect in the ""Gidget"" movies that made Sandra Dee a teen idol for a short time. And if the aspiring actress cared to expand her ambitions which no one could doubt she would there is a scene early in ""Crossroads"" in which she primly and sensibly informs her dweeby science lab partner that shes changed her mind about losing her virginity with him that suggests she could assume the mantle of Doris Day if she wanted to. All this nice-girl stuff undoubtedly will be a moot point a year from now or whenever Spears decides to jettison the image that brought her to fame in favor of an edgier more daring persona. But here shes Lucy daughter of hovering single dad (Dan Aykroyd not on solid ground as an auto mechanic) and a girl so wholesome that she complains upon graduating from high school in small-town Georgia that she missed out on partying and hanging out because Dad made her study all the time. Weird dislocations between the script and the casting rear their heads right out of the gate; Britney Spears is supposed to be a nerd the class valedictorian no less and an unfashionable social outcast to boot. Then on an impulse to visit the mother shes never seen she hops in a car headed west with girlhood friends Mimi (Taryn Manning) a pregnant trailer-trash burnout who plans to audition for a Hollywood singing gig and Kit (Zoe Saldana) a snooty black socialite who claims she has a fiance waiting for her in Los Angeles. The old Buick convertible is driven by Ben (Anson Mount) a taciturn musician friend of Mimis who is soon sneaking plenty of looks at Lucy while feigning indifference. Remarkably uneventful cross-country trip marked by little disputes about which music to listen to and where theyre going to sleep moves into second gear when Mimi gets stage fright at a karaoke competition and is replaced by Lucy. Voila a star is born and guess who ends up as lead singer at the Hollywood audition? Pic overall is constrained by an intense need to gloss over and cut away from Moments of Truth such as Lucys confrontation with her mother (Kim Cattrall in haughtily elegant Linda Evans mode) and her long-postponed bedding down with Ben which is presented almost as an afterthought and with no insight into Lucys subsequent feelings. In Shondra Rhimes inane screenplay everything is kept superficial and bland despite the ostensible heavy issues the girls have to deal with -- childhood abuse and abandonment betrayal pregnancy and the realization that life sometimes departs from your childhood dreams. Tamra Davis direction evinces no sense of style but rather smacks of ""coverage"" cut together in almost random fashion. Performances are utterly routine with Spears coming off as blandly appealing at best but exhibiting no special luminosity under admittedly adverse circumstances. Unusually pic will have no soundtrack album as the three major tunes Spears sings herein -- ""Im Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman"" ""Overprotected"" and ""I Love Rock n Roll"" -- are on her latest album. End credits outtakes strongly suggest that nothing of value was left on the editing room floor.

"Oops Britneys Done a Movie washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Weekend >> Follow The Post On D.C.-area nightlife events and dining Home Restaurants Bars Movies Events Music Museums Theater Kids Oops Britneys Done a Movie Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Desson Howe Washington Post Staff Writer Friday February 15 2002 OH THANK you Britney. You gave me such a spectacularly memorable movie ? ""Crossroads"" your screen debut ? that I am left in a state of near-bliss. It does wonders to a critic to know that you could be a continuing font of teen and post-teen kitsch for years to come. If you work hard enough you could even achieve the legendary status of a Kathie Lee Gifford ? I mean when you get really older. But lets not get ahead of ourselves. I do have faith in you in the immediate future because you have such towering confidence in your abilities as actor singer sex symbol and Americas Sweetheart. For that bubbly confidence I salute you. Speaking of bubbles nice work on the product placement too. I refer to that famous soda that you often advertise and which is prominently placed in a motel-room scene. In the interests of fairness however let me take this occasion to point out that Coca-Cola also makes a fine line of products including regular Coke Diet Coke and Cherry Coke. Lets talk about the movie though. After all there are certainly snatches of story between the product placement and shots of you in your underwear or other striking garments de fashion. You play ? and I think ""play"" is the right word ? Lucy the valedictorian daughter of a car mechanic and single father (your near-lookalike Dan Aykroyd). Your great pals are Kit (Zoe Saldana) and Mimi (Taryn Manning) who made a pact with you eight years earlier that each would follow her dream. Mimi wants to be a singer. Kit wants to be a bride. And you want to find your mother who left you when you were very young (who in her right mind would leave Baby Britney?). Upon graduation you and your friends take that opportunity. Mimi and Kit are headed to L.A. Mimi to sing in a record company audition and Kit to see her fiance. You join them because your mother lives in Arizona. Driving the slick 73 Buick convertible is Ben (Anson Mount) a mysterious Older Guy who played in the band during the graduation dance. Can I say this? Ben is a hottie I think it would be taxing for myself and all the readers out there to sum up the highs lows and other feelings I experienced watching your movie. Perhaps I should just say its a road movie for three girlfriends who follow their dreams find themselves and do a lot of joyful singing with certain sodas in their hands. Of course we know what the real high point is fess up Brit. Were gonna hear you singing arent we? During a karaoke contest you get to fill in for Mimi who (after an entire life spent hoping for this moment) suddenly loses her nerve. Lucky that And then you do what you do best You show that tummy Were yearning too for you and Ben to get together. That opportunity arises when he asks to read your poetry. When he sets it to music and then you start singing side by side with Ben at the piano. ""It feels like Im caught in the middle/ Thats when I realize/ Im not a girl/ Im not yet a woman . . ."" Brit when I heard that song I felt like that Mike Myers character Linda Richman on ""Saturday Night Live"" who gets all verklempt or overemotional at the mere mention of another phenomenon Barbra Streisand. Im feeling verklempt about you right now. Readers please talk among yourselves I need a moment. Britney Spears is neither girl nor woman ? discuss. CROSSROADS (PG-13 94 minutes) ? Contains sexual content teen drinking and a cavalier attitude toward the wearing of seat belts. Area theaters.

"Crossroads Britneys Fizzy Serving of Hot Pepsi washingtonpost.com gt; Print Edition gt; Style >> Follow Style On Movies Crossroads Britneys Fizzy Serving of Hot Pepsi Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Special to The Washington Post Friday February 15 2002 Oops she did it. It was only a matter of time before Britney Spears the diabetic-shock-inducing pop tart whose audience seems composed chiefly of 10-year-old girls and 50-year-old men would make her cinematic debut. Following hard on the Jimmy Chooed heels of such songstresses turned uhm actresses as Janet Jackson Mariah Carey and (Her Nibs) Madonna Spears has crossed that line between Madison Square Garden and the multiplex marquee to stake her claim as a fully developed artist one who needs desperately to explore yet one more of the many colors that are Britney in order to express herself more fully to the fans. Oh and make just a leeetle bit more money. Because really after all the platinum albums and Super Bowl commercials and HBO specials have come and gone every girl knows that its all about ancillary markets. But lets cut to the chase. Is ""Crossroads"" worse than ""Desperately Seeking Susan""? Yes. Is it better than ""Glitter""? You bet your baby-blue rhinestone-encrusted thong. Can Britney act her way out of a Kate Spade bag? Not really although she cannot be accused of overreaching. She hits her marks in ""Crossroads"" acquitting herself if not admirably at least not shamefully. But lets be real Streisand she aint. ""Crossroads"" finds Spears in a classic road movie one in which issues are faced demons slain virginity lost and the day saved by - wait for it - a crucially timed karaoke contest. After graduating from high school Lucy (Spears) who ""worked really hard"" to be valedictorian decides to find the mother who abandoned her 15 years earlier. She lights out for Arizona joining her two estranged best friends (Zoe Saldana and Taryn Manning) and a mysterious hottie (Anson Mount) who is chauffeuring the other two girls to Los Angeles where one will compete in - wait for it - a talent competition sponsored by a record company. Will the three girls reconcile? Will the strait-laced Lucy undergo a startling makeover into a babelicious sexpot who gets the guy nabs the record contract and sneaks in a heartfelt performance of Britneys new hit single ""Im Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman""? Ya think? It turns out that ""Crossroads"" is not a music video not yet a movie but more like an extended-play advertisement for the Product that is Britney. Withal it features competent direction from Tamra Davis who coaxes life into what could have been a thoroughly moribund enterprise. Spearss co-stars all bring surprising dimension to unsurprisingly flat characters and Davis and screenwriter Shonda Rhimes (""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"") use the car radio as a clever excuse for their star to burst out in her signature helium-propelled whimper. Although teen sexuality is the driving force theme and raison detre for the movie the filmmakers can be commended for portraying some of the real-life consequences of early sex and other reckless behavior - consequences that include pregnancy date rape and all-around yuckiness. (Less realistic is the sight of a bunch of girls from Georgia - where the faucets run hot cold and Coca-Cola - swigging nothing but Pepsi. But the corporate beast even Britneys must be fed.) Still its that very sexual candor that makes ""Crossroads"" so problematic straddling as it does the fine line that Spears has made a career of crossing as she tiptoes ever so coyly between Mouseketeer and jailbait. Britney Spearss live show is missing only the two-drink minimum to qualify as a gentlemens smoker but throughout her performances the singer seeks to defuse the aggressive sexuality of her persona with occasional wrinkle-nosed gee-whiz grins. She wants to have it both ways in ""Crossroads"" too eagerly stripping down to her skivvies (usually pink) and exposing her navel (always pink) then swaddling herself in fuzzy sweaters (mostly pink) that here seem to have mysterious re-virginizing powers. Whether the act is naive or cynical is up to Britneys audience to decide. But when that audience is composed of the aforementioned 10-year-olds the fine line shes playing with becomes more problematic. What are tweens to make of a bubble gum idol who is giggling with her girlfriends one minute and swinging lasciviously from a pole the next? Its not for nothing that ""Crossroads"" has been rated PG-13 meaning that parents are ""strongly cautioned."" Put more simply be afraid. Be very afraid. CROSSROADS (PG-13 94 minutes) - contains sexual content and brief teen drinking. At area theaters.

"USATODAY.com - Spears one-note acting sends Crossroads astray Home News Money Sports Life Inside Movies Movies home Now playing Home theater Tech Weather Site Web Click here to get the Daily Briefing in your inbox 02/15/2002 - Updated 0811 AM ET Spears one-note acting sends Crossroads astray By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Oops shes really done it this time. That chirpy songbird Britney Spears has popped up with more mindless drivel. The diva-in-training stars in Crossroads which is less a movie than a mind-numbingly dull road trip that offers plenty of opportunity for girlish high jinks radio duets and adorable mugging. Read more below Related Story Britney steps onto big screen in Crossover Anson Mount stars next to Britney Pop princesses leap to big screen Video Watch the trailer for Crossroads Photo Gallery Britney Spears A role model (sigh) for young girls and a sex symbol for young boys Spears is ever-mindful of looking her cutest. OK were covered there but acting is another thing. Sure she tries to emote (she cries pouts bursts into fits of giggles) but its all one note. Crossroads (out of four) Stars Britney Spears Anson Mount Zoe Saldana Taryn Manning Dan Aykroyd Kim Cattrall Director Tamra Davis Distributor Paramount Pictures Rating PG-13 for sexual content and brief teen drinking As a good girl who graduates from high school with stellar grades Spears tragically has never gone to a football game party or ""just hung out."" Shes named valedictorian -- mercifully were spared her words of wisdom -- and laments to her father (Dan Aykroyd in a thankless role) that she missed out on all the fun. Enter the girl power. Theyre no Thelma and Louises but Britney and her two Georgia gal pals (Zoe Saldana Taryn Manning) take to the road and set their sights on California. Rekindling the friendship they had as 10-year-olds the three find a way to parlay their singing into an act while transforming their clothes into glamorously skimpy costumes. Britney proves shes not that innocent when she wows the locals in a Louisiana bar by suggestively crooning Joan Jetts I Love Rock-n-Roll. Along the way Britney falls for a hunk (Anson Mount) and loses that pesky virginal stigma. Not since That Thing You Do have we been subjected so repeatedly to a movie tune. Not only must we hear her warble ""Im not a girl not yet a woman"" several times we must also endure her intone the lyrics as ""poetry."" Such foolishness proves Britneys still a girl not yet an actress.

Starring Britney Spears . Directed by Tamra Davis . (PG-13. 105 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres no point in pretending ""Crossroads"" is worse than it is. As pop- singing actresses go Britney Spears is not an embarrassment (like Madonna) and not yet an actress (like Mandy Moore ). And the movie is fascinating in its own strange way not as entertainment but as a cultural document. Go into any supermarket and theres Britney smiling from the cover of at least two magazines. Adults might forget her between TV commercials but she has been for years whispering nonstop into preteen and pubescent ears. ""Crossroads"" is a chance to eavesdrop on what shes been saying. She plays Lucy a virginal high school valedictorian who loves to sing. Her father (Dan Aykroyd) wants her to become a doctor but shes conflicted. She feels shes just not a doctor and not yet a singer either. There has always been a disconnect between Spears offstage and onstage personae. When not singing she cultivates the image of a scantily clad but chaste young lady. But onstage she acts like every sailors pal when the fleets in. At a pop concert this disparity can work. Music blurs edges elevates personality and pushes everything into the dimension of fantasy. But a movie makes everything literal. So in ""Crossroads"" we home in on a wholesome young thing then see her bumping grinding and groaning as though in a state of arousal. What is this about? Lucy and two of her old friends hook up with a young man and drive cross- country to Hollywood. Their driver (Anson Mount) has a prison record for violating the Mann Act. So now hes taking three underage girls over multiple state lines. Give the man credit. He finds a crime he likes and he sticks with it. Throughout ""Crossroads"" director Tamra Davis finds ways to show Spears off. She appears in her underwear twice in the first 15 minutes and carts out her trademark zany look -- eyes crossed tongue out. She sings ""I Love Rock and Roll"" in a karaoke bar and never stops giving us renditions of ""Im Not a Girl Not Yet a Woman"" which is the worst kind of bad song. Bad and catchy. In the end ""Crossroads"" is a lot like Spears herself. It cultivates not the illusion of wholesomeness since no ones buying it but the pretense of it. Yet examine the movies message and its pretty insidious. We see Britney taking off on a cross-country trip without her fathers permission hanging up on Dad when he tells her to come home and sharing her bed with an ex-con who looks as if hes 30. And the movie doesnt present this as naughty or even adventurous. Rather it presents this as the behavior of a nice girl whos a little on the nerdy conservative side. If this is a nice girl this is not good news though not yet a disaster. Advisory This film contains sexual situations and coarse language. -- Mick LaSalle SUPER TROOPERS Comedy. Starring Jay Chandrasekhar  Brian Cox . Directed by Chandrasekhar. (R. 100 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). . The members of the comedy troupe Broken Lizard are frat guys whove matured but only slightly. Their comedy ""Super Troopers"" is more sophisticated than say ""American Pie 2"" but theyve still got the good sense to know you cant have a romp without a little raunch. The dirty jokes provide the funniest moments in this oddly sweet comedy about jokester highway patrolmen. Thats right ""Super Troopers"" makes those officers in the mustaches and aviator shades -- the ones who pull you over and say ""Did you know how fast you were going?"" as if you didnt -- into comic and even sympathetic characters. Broken Lizard founder Jay Chandrasekhar the movies director plays the lead patrolman with the reassuring comic presence of Ray Romano. Hes the most levelheaded of the Vermont state troopers who toy with stoned teenagers and play dumb word games to ease their boredom. What little plot exists concerns the troopers rivalry with local police encroaching on their strip of highway. The first part of the picture is so tame that you wonder about the ""R"" rating with innocent tomfoolery like a rookie trooper being doused with whipped cream. Then the sexual high jinks begin. A running gag involves a German couple in a hot Porsche who show theres more than one way to be fast. Theres also a bit about bestiality thats beautifully done -- and bestiality is hard to do well. Mostly ""Super Troopers"" is plain goofy. When a trooper joins a local policewoman on a drug case he says ""We can be like Cagney and Lacey."" When she points out that those were two women he says ""OK Ill be Lacey."" Brian Cox the great Scottish actor revels in the role of the chief who knows when to reprimand his charges and when to join them in an old-fashioned sirens-blaring drunk. ""Super Troopers"" miscalculates with jokes about Afghanistan and the Taliban. Since the movie played Sundance more than a year ago the references obviously predate Sept. 11 which also means there was plenty of time to edit them out. . This film contains raw language drug and sexual humor. -- Carla Meyer RETURN TO NEVER LAND Animation. Directed by Robin Budd . Written by Carter Crocker and Temple Mathews. (G. 72 minutes. At Bay Area theaters). . Peter Pan is still a Lost Boy. Captain Hook still wants his hide. And Wendy Darling is grown up with two kids of her own. ""Return to Never Land"" the Walt Disney Pictures sequel to ""Peter Pan"" picks up the threads of the 1953 Disney animated feature -- based on the James M. Barrie classic -- and jumps forward to World War II when Wendy and family are living through bombings blackouts and evacuations. Her son Daniel roughly 5 is adorable and frisky. Daughter Jane about 12 is a gloomy spoilsport who dismisses her mothers tales of Peter Pan and Tinker Bell as ""childish nonsense."" Only when shes kidnapped by Captain Hook and taken to Never Land does Jane learn the power of faith and enchantment. This is pleasant safe entertainment that ought to appeal to kids younger than 10 especially to girls with its female-empowerment fantasy. Its got a good heart and a buoyant spirit familiar characters and a nice message about keeping ones heart open to experience and magic. Compared with such computer-animated features as ""Toy Story"" ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters Inc."" however ""Return to Never Land"" seems dated and ordinary. The standard for animation was raised significantly by those recent films from Pixar and Pacific Data Images in technical terms but also in humor hipness and character definition. Going back to ""Never Land"" then feels a bit like taking a ride in an old bumpy Studebaker. The plot is predictable and formulaic the colors muted the music forgettable and the action pokey. Since the focus is on skeptical Jane the Peter character remains sketchy and undeveloped. Foppish Capt. Hook is played for laughs crying ""Cast off you mangy dogs"" with theatrical elan then quivering like custard when a giant octopus occupies the deck of the Jolly Roger. For children theres something irresistible in seeing a stern authority figure like Hook exposed and humiliated. What better fun than ripping off the big mans pants literally in this case and subverting his silly facade of control and superiority? Veteran voice actor Corey Burton doesnt have quite as much fun with the part as Hans Conreid did in the 1953 cartoon or Australian actor Cyril Ritchard in the 1950s musical ""Peter Pan"" with Mary Martin. He doesnt quite pull off that absurd campy pomposity. But with so little else to distract us in ""Return to Neverland"" hes a blessing. -- Edward Guthmann SCOTLAND PA. (Dark comedy. Starring James LeGros  Maura Tierney  Christopher Walken . Directed and written by Billy Morrissette . (R. 102 minutes. At the Lumiere). . In ""Scotland Pa."" former actor and novice filmmaker Billy Morrissette transplants ""Macbeth"" to a 1970s burger joint populated by losers in their 30s who booze it up and race Camaros when not plotting coups. It all sounds way too cute and sometimes it is. The film works more as a concept than as a collection of funny lines and some comic premises bomb outright like the ""three hippies"" standing in for the three witches. But ""Scotland Pa."" succeeds because of the casts communal vibe of arrogant stupidity. Pat McBeth the counter girl at Duncans restaurant is the sharpest tack among the mouth breathers. Shes played by Maura Tierney Morrissettes wife and the fine TV actress from ""ER"" and ""NewsRadio."" Tierney has always been sexy in a sensible-shoes matching-401(k) kind of way but here she really lets loose. Her Lady Macbeth is a libidinous puppet master who prods her dullard fry cook husband ""Mac"" (James LeGros) into murder so they can install a drive-through. Nobody said progress came without sacrifice. When Mac gets passed over for the managers job his wife sees red and the restaurant owner lands in the deep fryer. You probably have some idea of what happens next The McBeths turn the restaurant into a gleaming fast-food palace but their respective psychoses and a detective named McDuff impede their rise to town pillars. Christopher Walken a master at genial evil makes McDuff as inscrutable as Tierneys Pat is transparent. When the scheming Pat flirts with the lawman he appears to respond shyly. Its hard to tell whos scamming whom but the smart moneys on McDuff. LeGros slowly transforms his character from dunderhead to calculating killer and he makes a good comic foil for Walken. As Macs pal Banco Kevin Corrigan wears his ""ugly guy"" glasses from ""Walking and Talking"" and reeks of squandered potential. The picture gets an enormous boost from music by 70s working-class heroes like Bad Company and Three Dog Night. The songs evoke a very specific era -- after Vietnam and before disco -- and move along but never overwhelm the story. Having a sensitive young football player intently listen to Janis Ians ""At Seventeen"" near a poster from ""Cabaret"" says more than any dialogue ever could. Advisory This film contains violence raw language sexuality. -- Carla Meyer THE TOWN IS QUIET Drama. Starring Ariane Ascaride  Jean-Pierre Darroussin Julie-Marie Parmentier and Gerard Meylan. Directed by Robert Guediguian . (Not rated. 132 minutes. In French with English subtitles. At Bay Area theaters.) . ""The Town Is Quiet"" is an audacious film set in contemporary Marseille. Writer-director Robert Guediguian has created a strange mosaic of a plot most of it surrounding a middle-aged woman with an unemployed alcoholic husband and a desperate junkie daughter. There isnt the usual story. Rather there are incidents occurring over a small period of time to a handful of characters. Only later perhaps does one realize that these events have one point of similarity They are emblematic of some fundamental decay at the heart of urban life. Something isnt rotten in Marseille. Everything is rotten in Marseille. Ariane Ascaride plays Michele who works every night in a fish market only to come home to a miserable household in which she has to listen to the bitter recriminations of her wastrel husband and care for her daughters illegitimate infant. Anything bad that can happen in ""The Town Is Quiet"" happens. In one scene Michele walks in to find the daughter (Julie-Marie Parmentier) turning tricks in the living room. Michele is appalled but as her daughters dependence on heroin becomes more acute and the need for money more desperate she herself decides to try prostitution. At 300 francs a pop she starts seeing a hapless cabdriver. At times Guediguians film seems almost as if its about to slide into utter absurdity. He keeps upping the stakes and piling on shocks until it borders on the ridiculous. Yet his strategy keeps him one step ahead of his audience throughout and the shocks never quite seem gratuitous. Always one gets the sense that this film is coming from some place real and terrible. . Advisory This film contains violence nudity sexual situations and harsh language. -- Mick LaSalle Most Popular 1 Dear Abby I want to contact mistress from 45 years ago 2 Cops Son of billionaire former supermodel arrested after... 3 Ann Coulter Hammered by Conservatives for Smearing US War... 4 Iceland man says Donald Trumps son left white powder at... 5 Dear Abby I dont want anyone to know that Ive retired 6 Bikini-clad Swedish cop makes arrest while sunbathing 7 Oakland-bound medical plane crashes -- 4 killed 8 Police Girl 14 slits teens throat in hope of first kill 9 Inmate charged in 2015 quadruple slaying in S.F. 10 Parilia Ball - San Francisco orgiastic event from almost a...

The question isnt frivolous. Britney Spears internationally famous pop star sells not only Pepsi these days the 20-year-old also sells a potent fantasy of American not-a-girl-not-yet-a-womanhood so loaded with message and subtext it practically ka-chings with marketing tie-in opportunities. Heres a spokesgirl of confident virginal virtue who playfully loves to gyrate like a salesmens-bar stripper - a cheerful disciplined and hard-working young lady who sings in the pretend-sexy style of a sweet sixteener lip-synching to Marilyn Monroe. Britney dresses dirty but she wants us to know shes Christian clean so look but dont paw. She wants us to know that shes approachable and always up for fun - a spoofy ""SNL"" skit a photo op with N Sync boyfriend Justin Timberlake a sock hop a clambake - but shell have to check with her manager first. In form content and packaging shes a made-in-the-USA dream right down to her Spalding-ball breasts Crest-sparkling smile and Bordens-calf wide-set eyes. The millions of preteens and their parents who love her for her Scotchgarded girl-woman perfection arent going to be disappointed by Crossroads. Heck and gosh neither was I so impressed and even charmed am I by the expertise with which Britney has been gently launched as a movie star. This girl-dream road trip a kid sister to ""Boys on the Side"" with a friendly jiggle or two of ""Coyote Ugly"" thrown in not only makes excellent use of the singers sweetly coltish acting abilities but it also promotes a standardized set of sturdy values with none of Mariah Careys desperate ""Glitter"" or any of Mandy Moores gummy pap in ""A Walk to Remember."" Family is important but good friends can make things better for those with imperfect families. Drinking alcohol is icky. No one worth knowing smokes. As always an American girl should follow her bliss - but she should also phone home. Above all look to Britney Spears; shell do the right thing. Why from her very opening shot in ""Crossroads"" she does things right bouncing in her undies in her girlish bedroom holding a spoon for a microphone (no hairbrush available?) and lip-synching to Madonnas ""Open Your Heart."" Here Britneys called Lucy and we quickly know this (1) Shes not just a dish shes also valedictorian of her small-town Georgia high school class; (2) she wants to find the mother in Tucson who ditched her when she was 3 leaving her to be raised by her overprotective car-mechanic father (Dan Aykroyd); (3) her worst faults according to the meanest kids in the hall are that shes ""sweet proper nerdy... and a virgin""; (4) Kit (Zoe Saldana) and Mimi (Taryn Manning) her two best childhood friends have grown up to become a luxury-loving buppie clotheshorse engaged to a cad at college in L.A. (thats Kit) and a self-described daughter of trailer trash now pregnant unmarried and eager to drive far away from her bad-luck present to a more exciting future in star-making California (thats Mimi). Thus the three young women find themselves riding west in a cool 73 Buick convertible with Mimis mysterious male friend Ben (Anson Mount) a hunky guitar-playing loner with a rep for having been in jail possibly for murder who turns out of course to be an upstanding fellow who unchains Lucys heart. And bod. There has been some consternation I gather among members of the Society for the Preservation of Virginal Role Models that Britney as Lucy relinquishes her tiara as princess of purity. But whats exemplary for those who would consider such things is the admirable way in which Lucy does assert control and exhibit maturity about her own sexuality. Among the many concise lesson-plan scenes by Shonda Rhimes (who wrote the fine teleplay for ""Introducing Dorothy Dandridge"") is an early one in which Lucy gently but firmly says no at the last minute to sex with her high school boyfriend (hey girls as is her right) which contrasts effectively with the slow honorable deepening relationship between Lucy and Ben that leads most naturally and with no camera gawking to bed. Not everything in ""Crossroads"" unfolds so smoothly. Lucys contact with her mother (Kim Cattrall) is just plain weird and a subplot involving the circumstances of Mimis pregnancy is contrived and false - a serious subject treated as mere device a detour from Britneycentrism rather than the real-deal major moral drama it deserves to be. But Tamra Davis the music-loving director who knew exactly how to let Drew Barrymore be Drew in ""Guncrazy"" (and for that matter let Adam Sandler be Adam in ""Billy Madison"") drives this sporty vehicle with pro precision. In ""Crossroads"" Britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway.
