The focus isnt on the human astronauts and their giant leap for mankind but on three fictional boy-like houseflies who in the name of adventure hitched a ride in the spacecraft. Its a kick to see actual moonwalker Buzz Aldrin at the end but must he really assure kids that the spacecraft was in fact free of contaminants? Oh phooey on pedants.

In this image released by Summit Entertainment a scene is shown from the animated film ""Fly Me To The Moon."" Photo Summit Entertainment Movie review Fly Me to the Moon 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Fly Me to the Moon Animated family film. With voices of Philip Bolden Trevor Gagnon David Gore Christopher Lloyd Adrienne Barbeau Ed Begley Jr. Tim Curry Kelly Ripa and Nicollette Sheridan. Directed by Ben Stassen. (Rated G. 85 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) With the release of the animated fantasy ""Fly Me to the Moon"" we are heading into another of Hollywoods periodic flirtations with 3-D. But this time it may be more than a fad. Once derided as a gimmick 3-D seems to be breaking through to the mainstream - digital technology is creating screen effects that are genuinely new and improved. (The new 3-D has deeply impressed Hollywood decisionmakers. DreamWorks and Disney are both jumping on the bandwagon in forthcoming animated films and James Cameron and Tim Burton also have 3-D projects in the works.) ""Fly Me to the Moon"" a whimsical family offering about intrepid houseflies who hitch a ride on the Apollo 11 moon shot is lifted out of the ordinary by 3-D images that at times are so realistic that audience members reach their hands into the air to try to touch them. Its clear that animators can now achieve levels of visual depth that were previously impossible. But the news isnt all good. While the vocal cast includes familiar names (among them Christopher Lloyd Adrienne Barbeau and Tim Curry) and theres an inspiring ""test your limits"" message the film is burdened with a cliched script that undercuts the intriguing images. Nat I.Q. and Scooter (Trevor Gagnon Philip Bolden and David Gore) are three adolescent flies who in 1969 live in a dump near Cape Kennedy with their families including a granddad (Lloyd) who had once stowed away aboard Amelia Earharts plane. The three are looking for a way to impress their families - which include fretting moms and a couple of cute pinkish maggots - so why not join the space program and make history? Needless to say the fly trio will play a surprising role in the moon shot. To complicate matters the young space travelers must not only avoid flyswatters but also contend with a cackling Russian-spy fly. (Parents may need to explain the Cold War to younger viewers.) The film ends with a live-action cameo by Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin. ""Fly Me to the Moon"" is the product of Belgian animation company nWave which has specialized in 3-D films for IMAX theaters and theme parks. Director Ben Stassen nWaves founder says the movie is the first animated feature to be created and released exclusively for 3-D. Although the 3-D effects are fun the films basic animation style certainly pales next to todays flashier bigger-budgeted productions. And while the script by Domonic Paris will probably pass muster with very young viewers their parents may grit their teeth at its saccharine quality. -- Advisory Mild gross-out humor.

And now theyre on a rocket heading for space - and heading right at you if youre wearing the 3-D glasses supplied at theaters where Fly Me to the Moon is showing. A gimmicky tale of a trio of Florida insects who join Apollo 11 astronauts Buzz Aldrin Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins on their historic summer of 69 jaunt Fly Me to the Moon claims to be the first-ever animated feature designed created and produced entirely in 3-D. The script however appears to have been designed created and produced entirely in 1-D a mishmash of kidcentric antics follow-your-dream cliches and innocuously icky humor. And aside from the 3-D effects (objects in zero gravity ""floating"" toward your nose the mega-follicles of a grandpa flys stubbly beard) director Ben Stassens toon is nothing special to look at. The movement of the characters - human and anthropomorphic housefly alike - is limited. And with its garbage-dump settings (where else are flies going to live?) its bespectacled larvae its maggots and ""mould fritters"" (a delicacy) Fly Me to the Moons Earthbound sequences are decidedly shabby and even off-putting. As for the space stuff well George Lucas need not lose any sleep. The plot has young fly boys Nat (Trevor Gagnon) IQ (Philip Daniel Bolden) and Scooter (David Gore) saving the Apollo 11 mission from disaster while back on Earth evil Soviet houseflies try to sabotage NASAs lunar operation. Yes Fly Me to the Moon not only dredges up vintage hits (the Rascals Canned Heat) it resurrects the Cold War too. Fly Me to the Moon  (out of four stars) Directed by Ben Stassen. With the voices of Philip Daniel Bolden Trevor Gagnon David Gore Christopher Lloyd and Kelly Ripa. Distributed by Summit Entertainment. Running time 1 hour 29 mins.

"Fly Me to the Moon 3-D fun but pale | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentFly Me to the Moon 3-D fun but paleIf rats can rule a kitchen in Ratatouille  why not a trio of houseflies as space explorers?By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Aug. 15 2008 An animated movie in 3-D starring the voices of Christopher Lloyd Nicollette Sheridan Tim Curry and Buzz Aldrin. Directed by Ben Stassen. 85 minutes. At major theatres. G   If rats can rule a kitchen in Ratatouille why not a trio of houseflies as space explorers?Article Continued BelowBilled as the first animated film ever made entirely in 3-D Fly Me to the Moon uses an arsenal of onscreen trickery in the cartoon tale of three preteen fly-boys who hitch a ride on Apollo 11.Its the summer of 1969 (Canned Heat provides the soundtrack clue) and the Apollo moon mission is big news even among the insects of the world. Nat (Trevor Gagnon) and his pals nerdy IQ (Philip Daniel Bolden) and blimpy Scooter (David Gore) are busy bees working on their own version of a space rocket. But Nat dreams bigger dreams of going on a space adventure himself.Hes encouraged by his grandpa who has had a few adventures of his own. He flew with Amelia Earhart and not only helped her get to Paris on her solo flight; he found romance on the ground with the lovely Soviet fly Nadia (Nicollette Sheridan as the most pneumatic cartoon creature since Jessica Rabbit).Mom (Kelly Ripa) isnt too happy with Nats aspirations. ""Dreams get swatted"" she reminds him.The kid-flies find a way to sneak into NASA and stow away on the rocket and soon theyre waving their wings to their families on the ground who have flown over to the local TV store to watch the sets through the window.""Oh my Lord of the Flies"" mom exclaims before keeling over.Since the Cold War is still in full flight evil Russian flies are determined to undermine the Americans. Ed Begley Jr. as Poopchev and Tim Curry as Yegor get to talk like Boris Badenov and vie to outdo each other in the ham Olympics.The space scenes are the best use of 3-D; rockets blasting off into the audience and the lunar module flying past your head. Scenes of perpetually ravenous Scooter rolling weightless in the cabin scarfing down floating food amuse but Homer Simpson did it better.As much fun as the 3-D is the colour has suffered in the process. The flies are a ghostly pale grey-blue. Even the multi-hued domes of St. Basils in Moscow look pallid and washed out. And the stiff animation on human characters - astronauts Buzz Aldrin Michael Collins and Neil Armstrong - is creepily waxy making them look like Madame Tussauds rejects.Still theres a lot to be learned in between the puns and sexist jokes about women always fainting; the movie used NASA blueprints for the animation and capsule transcripts for the astronauts dialogue. Aldrin lends his own voice and there are real sound clips from the lunar landing including Armstrongs historic words upon standing on the moons surface. Adults used to animation that runs on two tracks - the upfront stuff for the tykes and a witty subtext to entertain big people - may grow bored with the kid-leaning sensibility of Fly Me to the Moon.And why does Aldrin walk out as the credits roll and inject some uncalled-for realism about who did - and didnt - go into space?

The focus isnt on the human astronauts and their giant leap for mankind but on three fictional boy-like houseflies who in the name of adventure hitched a ride in the spacecraft. Its a kick to see actual moonwalker Buzz Aldrin at the end but must he really assure kids that the spacecraft was in fact free of contaminants? Oh phooey on pedants.

(Summit Entertainment) By Ty Burr Globe Staff / August 15 2008 Email| Print| Single Page| | Text size - + ""Fly Me to the Moon"" is a computer-animated kiddie flick about three housefly best friends who buzz their way onto the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. That sounds as genuinely painful as an August dog-days release can be and it would be except for two things. One if youre 6 years old you probably never realized how insanely cool the 1969 moon landing was in all its rocket-geek details. Two what the filmmakers do with 3-D here is within shouting distance of art.The director Ben Stassen has been making 3-D and IMAX shorts for a decade or so and somewhere along the line he like us got tired of jabbing audiences in the eyeballs with yo-yos and tape measures. Instead ""Fly Me to the Moon"" uses 3-D technology for something far more satisfying creating a sense of enchanting ever-shifting visual depth.You notice it right off At the screening I attended the first shot of a swampy pond extending off into the distant mist (cattails in the foreground) drew gasps of astonishment from not only the children but their parents. Nothing had happened yet but the setting seemed charged hyperreal.Throughout the film the Belgium-based 3-D house nWave works against our expectations Instead of a limited number of animated planes of depth ""Fly Me to the Moon"" evokes infinite gradations. Instead of launching objects out at us the film sends characters flying in over our heads from the back of the theater eliciting dismayed cries and swatting motions. For the first time in my experience a 3-D movie felt bigger than my ability to take it all in.The story line unfortunately is miniscule. ""A Bugs Life"" gone retro-rocket ""Moon"" is set at Cape Canaveral in 1969 and follows three young boy flies - heroic Nat (voiced by Trevor Gagnon) brainiac IQ (Philip Bolden) and fat lazy slob Scooter (David Gore) - as they scheme to sneak aboard the Apollo 11 launch. Trying to hold them back is Nats mom (Kelly Ripa); cheering them on is his retired-aviator Grandpa (Christopher Lloyd) and adorable little maggot siblings.(Thats right maggots. Theyre pink and wriggly and have big grins and ""cute"" eyes none of which keeps them from being thoroughly revolting. Between these guys last years ""Ratatouille"" and the cockroach sidekick in ""WALL-E"" vermin are the current must-have family movie accessory. Leeches call your agents. Wait thats redundant.)The character design is fairly creepy - Grandpa looks like a mummified skeleton - and the dialogue as inane as youd expect from second-tier kiddie product. The humans are awkward and Lego-like; the villainous Communist Russian flies just dumb. The hardware though - the hardware is perfect. From the Saturn V rocket that lifts the mission into space to the Eagle Lunar Module landing in the Sea of Tranquility ""Fly Me to the Moon"" introduces a new generation to mankinds most expansive adventure (complete with an enjoyably corny live-action cameo from astronaut Buzz Aldrin at the end).And because the story is constantly shifting from bug-level micro to the vast macro of the solar system (with human-size NASA drama in between) the movies 3-D visuals actually have a narrative function instead of serving as vaudeville jiggery-pokery. Watching ""Fly Me to the Moon"" youre forced to constantly renegotiate perspective and scale and not only is this a distinct pleasure in the manner of an M.C. Escher drawing or Istvan Banyais ""Zoom"" picture books for children but it dovetails with the movies greater scheme.The Apollo 11 mission forced us all to think of ourselves as both a little bit bigger and quite a bit smaller than we were used to. ""Fly Me to the Moon"" is a crummy movie for kids yet it still holds out the prospect of past wonders and future marvels. Its one small step for a housefly one giant leap for 3-D.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2008 Globe Newspaper Company.

If we dont know where we are there may be jokes but it is not truly comedy. Writer/directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore are not people with a lot of ideas. Their ""21 and Over"" was pretty much the same movie as their ""Hangover."" And the big innovation here is that this time its girls-gone-wild instead of boys. But it plays like it was inspired by a couple of womens magazine articles about the impossibility of ""having it all."" The movie says it comes down on the side of not judging other mothers those who seem to be losing it and those who seem to be holding it together. The message is that its good to forgive yourself for not being able to be perfect all the time. And its important to understand that loving your children means letting them learn to be responsible and not doing everything for them. But those good thoughts are undercut by the unexpectedly sour triumph of the main characters with antagonists who must be shown as spineless or pitiful. The reality of womens lives is a target-rich environment for comedy and the reality of mothers lives is especially so. But this script is so lazy that it does not meet the level of basic cable sitcoms for originality and wit. They have more in 22 minutes than ""Bad Moms"" does in 101. This is a movie that is supposed to be about female empowerment. There are two specific instances that involve women telling their cartoonishly awful husbands that they need to take more responsibility for their children and their households. And yet this is a movie that consistently shows the PTA as apparently entirely made up of women with the exception of one man who is shown at a PTA meeting specifically so he can be humiliated in public by his wife. Funny. amiright? And this is a school that apparently includes elementary middle and possibly high school students does not notice when a mother does a childs homework and has a pot-smoking principal who cant stand up to the President of the PTA. What? ""Hangover"" worked because most of the movie was about dealing with the horrible consequences of a major sort-of-accidental bender. ""Bad Moms"" tries to persuade us that a bender and attendant irresponsible behavior are signs of liberation. The bender is a mild one no tigers or tooth extractions. On the other hand the issue of money is raised but in the kind of fairy tale way that suggests no one connected with the movie has had to think about how to pay for groceries -- or damage inflicted on a grocery store -- in a very long time. Were supposed to believe them when they talk about how much they love their kids and would do anything for them but they dont really seem to enjoy or support them. And newsflash -- jokes about foreskins butt stuff and girl-on-girl kisses as a sign of rebellion and edginess are so 1998. The one-dimensional characters are as follows Mila Kunis plays Amy the exhausted mom of two who boots out her childish cheating husband. Shes had no sex in years. Kristen Bell is Kiki the exhausted mom of four whose husband treats her like Cinderella. They have sex once a week (""After ""Blue Bloods"") but he is not very uh excited or exciting. And Kathryn Hahn is Carla the happy unreliable slut who does not even know what a standardized test is much less whether her son has to take and pass them. She talks about sex all the time but does not seem to be having any either. Christina Applegate is Gwendolyn the Mean Girl (with henchmen played by Jada Pinkett-Smith and ""Bridesmaids"" co-writer Annie Mumolo (who should have done a major rewrite here). One thing Lucas and Moore get right is the combination of the humblebrag and the insult-wrapped in a compliment handed out by the ladies who run the school. Yes when they flutter their eyelashes and say ""I dont know how you do it"" to Amy she understands that they mean ""Youre doing it badly."" And there is a lot to be said about impossible standards and judgey people especially when it comes to parenting. But that requires actually saying something not just pointing it out. Amy blows her top decides not to try to be everything to everyone any more and then when Gwendolyn lashes back involving Amys daughter (in the Bizarro world of this movie the head of the PTA is in charge of everything in the school) Amy decides to run against her on a platform similar to but less authentic than that of Tammy in ""Election."" Even in a PTA election someone has to propose something more than ""lets do less and not judge each other."" All four women are brilliant actors and comedians and make as much of this material as they can but they all deserve much better. Jay Hernandez transcends the thankless role of the hot guy making him the only male in the film who is not completely infantilized. Someone needs to put him in a leading man role. And someone needs to start putting women in the leading role of writing and directing stories about women or at least men who can do better than this. NOTE The highlight of the movie is the series of conversations over the credits with the actresses and their real-life mothers filled with exactly the wit and heart missing from most of the film. Parents should know that this film is crude and explicit language throughout including very strong and crude language drinking drugs sexual references and explicit nudity and comic peril and violence. Family discussion Who is responsible for the standard the moms felt they had to live up to? How would this be different if it was about dads?

During the boring parts of this movie I played a game I made up that I called ""Same or Different."" For example in one of the earlier Bourne movies our hero the once-amnesiac CIA assassin Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) grabbed a limited-use anonymous cell phone for a particularly clever maneuver. In this one he grabs a small tracking device handily left out in a bowl like peanuts at a bar for happy hour. Same or different? Different because the first one was plausible and this one was ridiculous. The earlier films had exceptionally well-staged fight scenes that felt like real people who get out of breath and hurt each other and jockey for advantage. In the first moments of this film in addition to completely unnecessary jumps between five different locations around the world for no purpose he knocks out an enormous professional fighter with one punch. Same or different? Same answer as above.  And if we distinguish between the good guys and the bad guys by how much collateral damage they inflict on the world -- how many innocent bystanders get killed the answer here is more same than different. There are franchise films made for fan service and then there are those that do not even service the fans are merely a cash grab and retroactively devalue the franchise. This is a movie that asks us to believe that the head of the CIA and a Mark Zuckerberg-young titan of the worlds coolest social media company a sort of cross between Google and Facebook and Twitter and Snapchat decide to have a conversation of the utmost secrecy in a posh Washington DC restaurant the kind where everyone eavesdrops on the big shots at the next table especially reporters politicians and Hill staffers. The first three Bourne films transcended the action/spy genre with a gritty almost intimate feel far from the glossiness of James Bond and with an expanding deepening storyline that as the then-LA Times critic Manohla Dargis said began with the existential in ""Identity"" (Who am I?) extended to the moral in ""Supremacy"" (What did I do?). With the third film the question of culpability extended to the larger ""I"" of the government Who are we and what have we done? We will put aside for the moment the non-Bourne ""Bourne"" which mistakenly went in the direction of a secret government program that was more ""Captain America"" than Bourne with a mysterious ability-enhancing drug that removed the somber reality that resonated with the era of waterboarding and Abu Ghraib. There is plenty to explore and attempt to expiate now and the movie tries to touch on contemporary issues explored in far more compelling -- and terrifying -- terms in documentaries like Alex Gibneys ""We Steal Secrets"" and ""Zero Days."" It just doesnt do anything interesting with them while it is piling improbable motivations and preposterous situations almost as high as the carnage and wrecked cars. Parents should know that this film has constant spy-related action-style peril and violence many characters injured and killed including many innocent bystanders themes of government corruption and some strong language. Family discussion Who should decide the balance between privacy and security and how much information about those decisions should be public? What real-life events inspired this story?

Thats assuming theres an audience for it. Fly Me to the Moon tells the story of the Apollo 11 moon landing - through the eyes of flies. (That would be thousands of eyes one assumes.) Why? Flies are not traditionally your lovable Disney-grade characters. More often theyre associated with the business end of a swatter. But theyre small enough to stow away aboard the space flight. Thus Nat (Trevor Gagnon) IQ (Philip Bolden) and Scooter (David Gore) accompany the astronauts on their historic mission becoming heroes to flies everywhere. How weird is that? There are what billions of flies? And they live in and around . . . better not to overthink this. The basic plot involves the three fly buddies trying to impress their friends by sneaking aboard the Apollo. This proves easy enough which isnt exactly an advertisement for the sanitary quality of the space program. The flies even manage to repair a short circuit during the flight. Their trip is especially meaningful to Grandpa (Christopher Lloyd) Nats grandfather who back in the day sneaked aboard Amelia Earharts plane when she crossed the Atlantic. Whatever. A subplot involves Yegor (Tim Curry) an evil Russian fly determined to sabotage the entire mission so that American flies wont be the first on the moon. (Ed Begley Jr. provides the voice for Yegors assistant appropriately named Poopchev.) Foiling Yegors plan will involve help from Grandpas former Russian girlfriend Nadia (Nicollette Sheridan) who somehow manages to make the trip from Russia to the United States before Yegors henchmen (henchflies?) can wreck the mission. Theres an odd bit at the end where the real-life Buzz Aldrin tells us that it was impossible for flies to actually get onboard a rocket. So much for that. Yet as silly as the story is - this kind of thing makes you appreciate the guys at Pixar all the more - the 3-D is fantastic. When the rocket blasts off it seems to surge right through the theater. Other things fly out at you some part of the story some just to remind you that director Ben Stassen and his team are good at this kind of thing. Young children might hook onto the characters particularly the overweight Scooter big on food jokes. But for most people Fly Me to the Moon is not so much a movie as it is technology showing off.

Rated G. ""Fly Me To the Moon"" deserves a splattering swat. This cut-rate computer-generated imagery comedy is a stumbling step for animation following three young houseflies who stow away on Apollo 11 fulfilling their grandfathers appetite for adventure. Ever-hungry Scooter brainiac IQ and heroic Nat sneak onto the moon flight while Soviet spy fly Yegor (voiced by Tim Curry) offers token attempts to sabotage the mission; we all remember what happened. So theres not much suspense in the proceedings. Viewers who are old enough to eat without a bib are unlikely to find much of interest in the procession of puns and generic zero-gravity gags that fill out the films running time. View showtimes COLIN COVERT Henry Poole is Here  out of four stars. Rated PG for thematic elements and some language. Heaven help us if we are so spiritually deprived that we need the simplistic explanation of faith contained in ""Henry Poole Is Here."" Burdened with the ephemerality of life Henry Poole (Luke Wilson) buys a house in a quiet suburb hoping to disappear. When an effigy in the form of a face appears on his newly stuccoed wall miracles start happening and Henrys planned life of isolation and self-pity is turned upside down. Both Wilson and director Mark Pellington are diving into new territory with ""Henry Poole."" Pellington (""Arlington Road"" ""The Mothman Prophecies"") acknowledges that this is a personal film that reflects his struggle after his wife died four years ago. Wilson takes on the dramatic role with subdued seriousness stretching himself to accommodate moments of melodrama with moderate success. The emotional impact however is largely subjugated by Pellingtons willingness to cue the quasi-sentimental music. ""Henry Poole"" works hard to convert us even pulling out quotes from Noam Chomsky but it feels a little too much like a bumper sticker. In the end it is unclear whether Henrys life is turned around by divine intervention or simply by moving next door to a beautiful single woman but I guess that depends on where your faith lies.

Mike Judges annual compilation of independent animation gathers more than two dozen funny short subjects in a gallery of mind-blowing animation from tomorrows top animators. The subject matter extends from grumpy slapstick undertakers in the computer-generated story ""This Way Up"" to a vexed sex worker in Steve Dildarians hilarious ""Angry Unpaid Hooker."" ""USAVITCH (Beware of Distraction)"" features a family of fanciful bunny-like creatures taking a car trip on a cliff-edge highway the family sedan steered by an extremely distracted driver. ""Spaghetti Western"" is a phantasmagorical semi-disgusting cooking lesson involving Rubiks Cubes Post-it notes candy corn dice and Pick-up Sticks. Bon appetit.

Alluding to but never showing us the eyes on the back of its characters heads and with Christopher Lloyds grandpa appearing as if he were modeled after Willem Dafoe instead of Jeff Goldblum (or--you know--an actual housefly) this sketchily conceived and executed space yarn is one missed opportunity after another. As the 3D genre necessitates whole patches of the film hinge on pointy objects popping off the screen and threatening ocular protrusion but aside from Neil Armstrong landing on the lunar surface and awestruck fly-boy Scooter (David Gore) witnessing the totemic event from inside the mans helmet theres nothing inventive about the films perspective of the world and the space above our heads. The be-all-that-you-can-be message is sweet as is the way its main characters are written as secret saviors of the Apollo 11 mission but the characterizations and details are derivative with Scooter and his buddies I.Q. (Philip Bolden) and Nat (Trevor Gagnon) more than suggesting Alvin and the Chipmunks. These flies are meant to be one of a kind but theyre just pop-culture magpies.

Parents can rest easy For those tots convinced by ""Fly Me to the Moon"" that three talking houseflies stowed away on Apollo 11 and saved the moon mission from certain disaster Buzz Aldrin himself appears at the end of this 3-D animated adventure to straighten them out. Its a bizarre moment in a film whose sense of humor is more antique than its 1969 setting. Timing might otherwise be golden though as the off-the-wall adventure/comedy is poised to fill the kid-fare vacuum between ""Wall-E"" and ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa."" Otherwise its a wingless exercise despite a rather heartening attitude toward space travel that will introduce young auds to the glory that was NASA in the 60s. Setting things up via mock-dated black-and-white animated newsclips pic shows the use of chimps in space (lots of ""Space Chimps"" around recently) and the progress of the Mercury-Apollo programs that led to the planned moonwalk in the summer of 69. Aldrin Michael Collins and even Neil Armstrong are represented here in animated form and its as close to the reclusive Armstrong as anyones likely to get. Buoyed by period music -- Canned Heat ""Groovin "" and of course ""Fly Me to the Moon"" -- the wholly digitalized feature about three high-flying pests begins with Nat (voiced by Trevor Gagnon) whos grown up listening to his Grandpas (Christopher Lloyd) stories about saving Amelia Earhart during her pioneering solo transatlantic flight in 1932. Given that the life expectancy of a housefly is less than two months crusty Grandpa is something of a pioneer himself. But his stories stir his grandsons imagination and Nat enlists buddies IQ (Philip Daniel Bolden) and Scooter (David Gore) to come along and take a space ride. They are accompanied at one point by Strauss ""Blue Danube"" (a piece the young flies might have heard a year earlier had they been Kubrick fans). ""Dreamers get swatted"" Nats mother (Kelly Ripa) warns her son -- although Grandpas always been one and look how long hes lasted. Grandpa gets a blast from his well-traveled romantic past when Nadia (Nicollette Sheridan) shows up from Russia to let them know the Soviet Space Program Fly Division is upset that the U.S. has beaten them in getting their insect life to the moon. And the Russians have sent the nefarious Yegor (Tim Curry) to sabotage the U.S. moon mission. Had ""Fly Me to the Moon"" been a bit more ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" all this would still have made no sense at all but it would have been a lot funnier. Pic is a sort-of history lesson a sort of comedy a PSA for childhood obesity (Scooter is dangerously fixated on food) and a 3-D toon that seems more artificial than realistic. When the requisite objects pop off the screen they dont do so in a way that expands the ordinary 2-D constraints but rather in a way that reminds you of those constraints in the first place -- which seems contrary to what a 3-D film is meant to do. And for all its computerized ambitions ""Fly Me to the Moon"" is a curiously retro project. The animated characters are stiff and limited and seem reminiscent of such relatively primitive 60s cartoons as ""Crusader Rabbit"" albeit with the dubious advantage of being three-dimensional. Production values are adequate. Because pic was fully rendered via computer no cinematographer or editor is credited.
