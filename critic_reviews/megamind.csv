At a low ebb (and holding a torch for feisty Jean Seberg-a-like reporter Roxanne Ritchi voiced by Tina Fey) he entertains the notion of giving up evil altogether.If this sounds a little like the recent Despicable Me thats because it rolls with a similar idea albeit employing a more realistic animation style and a strain of reference-heavy humour aimed at a slightly more mature audience. But the film also pinches a few pages out of the Kick-Ass rule book notably in the way it dismantles the archetypal masked crusader and delights in revealing the mundane chores of life as a full-time master of chaos those jumbo-collared leather capes dont just stitch themselves you know.Ferrells voice work is spot on. He even runs with an amusing speech impediment for which Metro City becomes Metrocity and in one truly surreal moment he answers the telephone with Olo? after which his minion (David Cross) reminds him Its ""hello"". Yet for a film whose stock in trade are tongue-in-cheek reversals of comic-book cliche it too often settles for trite audience-pleasing. We can only guess how long it took the guys in the soundtrack team to come up with Bad to the Bone and Michael Jacksons Bad. And when Jonah Hills bumbling cameraman is zapped with a superpower raygun and hastily ushered in as the enemy the film jettisons its raison detre for a standard if splendidly executed city-wrecking finale.

By Peter Rainer Film critic November 5 2010 Save for later Saved Metro Man voiced by Brad Pitt (r.) and Tighten voiced by Jonah Hill are shown in a scene from the animated feature Megamind. DreamWorks Animation/Paramount Pictures/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? The 3-D animated comedy ""Megamind"" which features a bald and bluish bad guy (voiced by Will Ferrell) reminded me a lot of ""Despicable Me"" which featured a bald and whitish bad guy (voiced by Steve Carell). Maybe there should be a moratorium on animated movies about bald bad guys. Or maybe there should just be a moratorium on 3-D already. Its not that ""Megamind"" which is about battling superbaddies and superheroes is all that terrible. No doubt some of it is charming enough to induce giggles in its preteen target audience. But Pixar has set an awfully high bar for this sort of thing (""The Incredibles""). Whats needed is a narrative invention to match the technical invention.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Talk about your unreliable narrators. At the start of the impossibly slick sweetly wise animated romp ""Megamind"" the titular villain recounts how hes come to the end of the line. He is tumbling to his demise. A ray gun floats in the air nearby. It doesnt look good. It all began in a galaxy far far away as they say. On the eve of their planets destruction Baby Megamind was put into a space module by his folks much like the Man of Steel was saved by his parents. Only the blue-hued big-headed Megamind (Will Farrell) is not going to be a hero but a nemesis. Along for the journey is Minion (David Cross) his pet-assistant- only friend a sharp-toothed fish- gorilla-robot as the filmmakers describe him. At the same time a perfect baby boy is placed by his parents into a capsule and sent hurtling Earthward. ""Megamind"" is a nature-versus-nurture ride a hyper-amusing parable of the meaning of destiny. Written with great wit by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons its a good-take-on-evil tussle that dialectical whiz Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel would dig. Guess who catches all the breaks? The baby with just-so hair lands in a mansion and grows up to be masked superhero Metro Man (Brad Pitt) the protector of Metro City. Megamind winds up in an institution for the criminally gifted. Over the years the two grow into rivals. One saves Metro City again and again. The other tries to ravage it starting with mispronouncing the burgs name rhymes with atrocity. Like an extraterrestrial Wile E. Coyote Megamind is skilled -- at losing. Like Road Runner the masked man in tights can be a little too superior too smug. ""Megamind"" asks what happens to evil if good -- embodied by super-hero Metro Man -- disappears? What happens if a new rival forces a bad guy to take a stand contrary to his nature? If that sounds a bit highfalutin the kids in the preview screening hooted and guffawed. Directed by Tom McGrath (""Madagascar"") ""Megamind"" is a fanciful colorful exposition of character from Megaminds am-I-blue concern to Metro Mans puffed-up poses to the rookie arrogance of a newbie super-hero named Tighten. The cast is ace. Tina Fey provides the sassy savvy voice of local news anchor Roxanne Ritchi object of Megaminds desire and lure to goad Metro Man into conflict after conflict. Megamind isnt the only soul with a hankering for the newswoman. Cameraman Hal (Jonah Hill) has eyes for his co-worker. And ""Megamind"" weaves a wacky charming romantic quadrangle into the mix. Roxanne does have a weak spot She resorts to hype in covering Metro Man. Heres a line -- and quoting it doesnt begin to spoil the best of the of the hilarious script ""His heart is an ocean inside a bigger ocean."" Roxannes not alone. And theres a lesson for young and -- more to the point -- old in the adoration Metro City fawning citizens offer Metro Man. Of course it goes without saying ""Megamind"" arrives to the multiplex in 3-D. Without comparison shopping -- it previewed in 3-D -- one cant know how differently the movie would unfold. But the storys the thing. And this one is as subtly deep as it is ridiculously fun.

It would take a feat of amazing narrative prowess -- and maybe a voguish black cape -- to make it fresh again. Somehow Megamind pulls it off. It does so by zooming in on the bad guy and tweaking the usual origin story so its less the tale of a hero born than a villain in the dumps of a midlife crisis. In theory this shouldnt be entertaining. In theory it should come off as corny and derivative and it should stick to your teeth with Tootsie Roll tenacity when its over. Two heroic forces save us from this fate a warm zingy script (by Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons) and a characteristically wacko voice performance by Will Ferrell as Megamind a cobalt blue bulbous-headed freak from a distant planet who defeats his longtime nemesis for control of Metro City but doesnt cope well with success. In Megaminds view Metro Man (Brad Pitt) has it all ""the power of flight invulnerability and great hair."" He also has the love of a good newswoman in Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) a sparky Lois Lane type whos fed up with Megaminds repeat kidnappings. Then the unthinkable happens. Megamind vanquishes Metro Man. Addicted to the buzz of combat and bored out of his exceedingly large head the supervillain resolves to create a new superhero for his own entertainment. Director Tom McGrath co-helmed Madagascars 1 and 2 so he knows his way around a jouncy animated feature. This one involves a bit more hard-hitting moral pingpong than most kids flicks (Now hes evil Now hes good Oops evil again). It also has one fatally unlikable character a chinless jerk who almost killed the movie for my 10-year-old. On the flip side Megamind has an unusually sweet disposition (and unusually fancy chin hair) for a power-crazed alien antihero. I do love Ferrell whose absurdist man-child routine has always been a matter of taste. But love him or hate him he long ago established himself as one of filmdoms most idiosyncratic line-readers; his rubbery tenor bends and snaps with a singsong pliancy that transforms average dialogue. One of the funniest running gags is Megaminds mispronunciation of everyday words school becomes ""shooool"" while Metro City winds up rhyming with ""atrocity."" The plot is predictable in the broad strokes - especially if youve seen the trailer which spoils a major twist - but delightfully unexpected in the smaller ones including a priceless appearance by a key personality from Superman. It all trips along at high speed with DreamWorks swooping visuals its bumptious 3-D animation falling somewhere between the airborne dazzle of How to Train Your Dragon and the odd dystopian gloom of Shrek Forever After. The emotions fall squarely between them too bad vibes and garbage pile up on the streets in Metro City but good times are coming. Romance is in the air. And Megamind it turns out is a villain to root for. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Nordstrom Rack Clear the Rack Sale Up to 75% off + free...

DreamWorks/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption DreamWorks/Paramount Pictures Megamind Director Tom McGrath Genre Animation/Comedy/Family Running Time 96 minutes Rated PG for action and some language With Will Ferrell Tina Fey Jonah Hill Brad Pitt Watch A Clip Crash The Party Actors often say that villains are more fun to play than heroes. Othello may be noble but Iagos more interesting; Batmans the good guy the Joker gets the punch lines. And childrens films lately have been playing to that notion by centering on figures usually typecast as bad guys -- a rat in Ratatouille an ogre in Shrek a criminal mastermind in Despicable Me. To that list of animated infamy let us now add the title character in Megamind. Hes introduced with an origin story that will sound familiar to adults On a planet thats about to explode young parents place an infant in a spacecraft bound for safety on Earth. The twist is that this scenario happens twice this time with one kid landing in a nice neighborhood and growing up to be the hero we expect Metro Man who literally walks on water as hes cheered by the citizens of Metro City. The other interplanetary orphan lands in a jail where hes brought up by criminals with the not unpredictable result that he grows into the archenemy role -- Megamind emphasis on archness because his mind isnt nearly as mega as he thinks it is. Megaminds plots tend to backfire his inventions turn out to have unexpected side effects and hes so socially isolated he doesnt even know that Metro City doesnt rhyme with ""atrocity."" Superhero-story conventions being what they are it never occurs to Megamind (Will Ferrell) that he might actually triumph over Metro Man (Brad Pitt). So when he accidentally does he has no idea -- once hes finished the obligatory preening and gloating -- what to do with himself. And therein hangs the rest of a tale that director Tom McGrath and his animating minions have made quirky clever and as artfully three-dimensional as it is jokey. (Which is saying something.) i Metro Man voiced by Brad Pitt is the hero of Metro City whose unexpected defeat leaves Megamind at loose ends. Dream Works/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption Dream Works/Paramount Pictures Metro Man voiced by Brad Pitt is the hero of Metro City whose unexpected defeat leaves Megamind at loose ends. Dream Works/Paramount Pictures Vocals from Jonah Hill as a Jimmy Olsen-like TV cameraman who dreams of superhero stardom; and Tina Fey snarky in what you might call the Lois Lane role add to the fun. Fey is dismissive enough of both the full-of-himself superhero and a pair of puffed-up ubervillains that you can almost forget shes stuck playing an all-too-typical damsel in distress. Guess even a superhero spoof cant stray too far from convention; maybe in the inevitable sequel shell get superpowers of her own. Until then the kiddie set can chortle at Megaminds slapstick and its goofy one-upmanship while adults get a kick out of all the smart spatial tricks that highlight the 3-D effects plus a running joke in which Ferrell channels Marlon Brando as Jor-El. Kids watching Megamind will have no idea why youre laughing at that but thats a good thing right? Therell be plenty of time later on for them to become meta-mindful.

"Megamind review sleek shiny -- and not very interesting |       NJ.com comments Megamind review sleek shiny -- and not very interesting Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 05 2010 at 809 AM View/Post Comments AP Photo/DreamWorks Animation Roxanne Ritchi voiced by Tina Fey right and Megamind voiced by Will Ferrell are shown in a scene from the animated feature ""Megamind."" Its in 3-D and Imax and stars a humongous-headed villain fighting a supremely chinned hero battling up and down the streets of a shining megalopolis. But theres one thing in ""Megamind"" that isnt supersized The jokes. Theres nothing particularly wrong with the picture. Its a slick shiny cartoon with the usual obsessive-compulsive CGI animation. (You want to see perfectly rendered highly waxed linoleum floors and intricately detailed hairdos? Look here.) Its just that the movie isnt very funny or even inventive. The plots nature-vs.-nurture idea has two nearly identical alien super-beings landing on Earth as infants. One however is raised in a wealthy family with every advantage; the other is brought up by criminals. Flash forward a couple of decades and guess whos the beloved hero and whos the hissable villain? The script puts a bit of a twist on things by making the hero an arrogant ass and the villain a misunderstood mess. There are also some knowing digs at the Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" movies (including an extended parody of Marlon Brando that only the oldest parents in the audience will get.) But too much of this is familiar. Movie Review MEGAMIND (PG) DreamWorks/Paramount (96 min.) Directed by Tom McGrath. With the voices of Will Ferrell Brad Pitt Tina Fey. Now playing in New Jersey. Ratings note The film contains cartoon violence. Stephen Whittys review TWO AND A HALF STARS The jut-jawed superhero and the annoying dweeb turned super-villain? Had them both in the far-better ""The Incredibles."" The sympathetic bald bad guy surrounded by hundreds of automated assistants? Just saw that last summer in ""Despicable Me."" And the wall-to-wall soundtrack of 80s-era album-oriented rock? A requisite part of every DreamWorks cartoon. The film has its moments. Although Will Ferrells effete voice for the evil Megamind gets tiresome there are one or two funny tics (including his inability to pronounce even the simplest words). Brad Pitt is properly stalwart as the valiant Metro Man and Tina Fey adds just the slightest edge to her spunky ""girl reporter."" AP PHOTO Metro Man (Brad Pitt) high-fives his fans in DreamWorks Animations Megamind Best of the bunch is Jonah Hill who voices the dorky TV cameraman -- and amusingly morphs from a sputtering Jimmy-Olsen wannabe into a nefarious character all his own. But theres still not quite enough going on here either in terms of humor or excitement; small children are likely to be disappointed by the paucity of silly slapstick or bathroom gags while their older siblings will probably fidget at the lack of scares. (The two 12-year-old boys I took summed up the whole thing with a shrug.) So parents unless you have the target audience of 8- to 10-year-olds in the house be advised. And be cheered The truly excellent ""Tangled"" comes out in just a few more weeks.

Youre so predict able"" a victim com plains to the misun derstood villain of the title in the bela bored superhero spoof ""Megamind."" She makes a very good point. This animated feature is what Yogi Berra called ""deja vu all over again"" its shopworn premise most recently having served the marginally better ""Despicable Me"" this summer. ""Megamind"" is a dispiriting return to the tired star-driven pop-culture-ridden formula that DreamWorks Animation ran into the ground before its best feature in years this springs ""How to Train Your Dragon."" Now with Tom McGrath (""Madagascar"") at the helm of ""Megamind"" its back to the same old Shrek -- er dreck. Will Ferrell voices the title character who as an infant refugee from an exploding distant planet lands in a prison -- while his heroic nemesis Metro Man (Brad Pitt) is raised in a more positive environment. The first of several montages inspired by Pixars infinitely superior ""The Incredibles"" details Megaminds long futile attempts to triumph over Metro Man with his convoluted schemes. But one day Megamind eliminates his rival in spite of his bumbling efforts. Not only is Megamind able to lord over Metro City hes even able to successfully woo Roxanne (Tina Fey) Metro Mans Lois Lane-ish newsgal and erstwhile love interest through the use of a device that allows him to impersonate a sensitive dweeb. But Megamind quickly becomes as bored as the audience is with the lack of dramatic conflict. He decides to create a new hero to battle by injecting a nerdy cameraman named Hal with DNA from Metro Man. But Tighten as his new creation is known doesnt turn out as planned -- and Megamind is forced into the new and not entirely comfortable role of hero to save Metro City from Tighten running amok. The generic action -- including a falling building that unfortunately summons memories of 9/11 -- is presented in headache-inducing 3-D and the comedy isnt particularly sharp. The funniest bit with Ferrell sending up Marlon Brandos performance in the first ""Superman"" movie is funny the first time but its beaten into the ground. Another running gag is Megaminds tendency to pronounce ""Metro City"" as ""MetROcity."" MediOCrity"" would more accurately sum up this movie.

And the least successful. Over the years he has tried to conquer Metro City in every imaginable way. Each attempt a colossal failure thanks to the caped superhero known as ""Metro Man"" an invincible hero until the day Megamind actually kills him in the throes of one of his botched evil plans. Suddenly Megamind has no purpose. Starring Will Ferrell Brad Pitt Tina Fey Jonah Hill Director Cameron Hood Kyle Jefferson Running time 136 Release Opened Nov 5 2010  Editorial Review Mwahahaha Plenty of laughs evil or otherwiseBy Michael OSullivanFriday November 5 2010In the eternal struggle between the forces of good and evil good almost always triumphs - at least in Hollywood Flash Gordon vs. Ming the Merciless; Superman vs. Lex Luthor; Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. In ""Megamind"" an animated fable about a similar clash of moral titans funny reigns victorious. At the center of this utterly delightful film is its eponymous hero - er villain - a blue-skinned alien who was sent to Earth as a baby when his home planet exploded. Unlike his superhero nemesis Metro Man (voice of Brad Pitt) another refugee from a dying world Megamind (Will Ferrell) did not grow up with ""the power of flight invulnerability and great hair"" as he so bitterly puts it. Instead Megamind has had to learn to get by on the powers that reside within his giant bald cranium. That and showmanship. Unfortunately like ""Despicable Mes"" Gru Megamind is less evil genius than evil underachiever. Hes not bad so much as bad-ish. ""Imagine the most horrifying terrifying evil thing you can think of"" he tells one of his victims ""and then multiply it . . . by six."" In his tangles with Metro Man Megamind had gotten used to constantly coming out on the bottom. When it comes to personality however Megamind wins hands down. Theres a reason the movie is named after him and not his rival in white tights. Like other men of steel Metro Man is a muscle-bound bore. Megamind on the other hand is brought to life with every ounce of Ferrells comic might in this sharply satiric deftly written twist on the superhero trope a tale in which the bad guy is if not as strong as his adversary at least a lot more entertaining. Thankfully Pitts Metro Man is dispensed with early in the movie in an upset victory that surprises even Megamind. Ten minutes into the tale Megamind finds himself unexpectedly on top for the first time since he and his archenemy came hurtling to Earth in matching escape pods all those years ago. Its not a situation hes especially comfortable with. Just as good cannot exist without evil - at least theoretically - so too does evil need something to push against. Whats the point of world domination when theres no one left to dominate? Faced with the sudden absence of his longtime adversary Megamind decides to create a hero from scratch or at least from Metro Mans DNA a scrap of which has survived in the form of decidedly un-superheroic dandruff. The lucky recipient? Hal (Jonah Hill) the Jimmy Olsen-esque sidekick - and unrequited suitor - of intrepid TV newswoman and Lois Lane look-alike Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey). Hal as it turns out isnt exactly the hero type. He would much rather play the bad guy than the good guy especially after he learns that Megamind is not just his rival in matters of crime and punishment but in affairs of the heart. Thats right Megamind also has a soft spot for Roxanne. The resulting love triangle is comic gold. Not only does it afford an opportunity for Megamind to woo Roxanne - a crazy couple if ever there was one - but also to do battle with Hal now known as Tighten and currently wreaking havoc in Metro City. It also affords the opportunity for Megamind who up until now has made a pretty lousy villain to start looking for his inner hero. Directed by Tom ""Madagascar"" McGrath and written by Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons ""Megamind"" is a smart funny and original treat. Sweet enough to deliver a message about creating your own destiny but with just enough sour grapes not to cloy the movie delivers pure pleasure from start to finish. Its also beautifully animated with great sensitivity to detail. Check out the faintest flush of pink for instance in Megaminds oversize ears. For once the 3-D gimmick seems justified with eye-popping scenery and action. ""Whats the difference between a villain and supervillain?"" asks Megamind of Tighten as our hero - yes hero - makes one of his rock-star-like entrances. ""Presentation"" The same might be said of the difference between a movie and a super movie. ""Megamind"" has presentation in spades. But it also has something even rarer than that. Its got heart.Contains action sequences and mildly crude language.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 05 2010 1200AM EDT Last updated Thursday Nov. 04 2010 359PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Its a bird its a plane its ... an ill-bred alien with a blue face green eyes and a fat mean streak. Sorry kiddies but Superman is gone and the sad fact is hard upon us These days heroes are scarce even in cartoons. Recently Despicable Me toyed with that fact in witty ways twisting the genre into amusingly weird shapes. Now Megamind tries to do the same. Tries yet lacks the courage of its wicked convictions - the plot is rich the execution poor. Nothing wrong with the opening gambit which doubles as a new spin on the old nature/nurture debate. From separate locales deep in the galaxy a pair of baby E.T.s rocket down to planet Earth specifically to the vertical sprawl of Metro City. Oops that blue-faced one lands on the wrong side of the tracks smack dab in the midst of a prison and under the cons tutelage grows up to become the villainous Megamind (Will Ferrell). The other finds sanctuary in the loving arms of the middle-class and matures into the chisel-jawed right-thinking ultra-bland Metro Man (Brad Pitt). Seems that nurture has taken its toll. From there of course our battling MMs do what good and evil must. Yep in their very struggle they justify each others existence. (Note to any pre-Socratic scholars in the preschool audience Heraclitus would be delighted by such a unity of opposites.) Happily for the fate of the world and the perpetually imperilled Roxanne (Tina Fey) the goodly Metro Man wins out at the end of the day - at least until that late afternoon when he meets his mortal end. Its time for the blue baddie along with his minion Minion to despotically rule Metro City and whats worse to give the place a whole different inflection - now it rhymes with ""atrocity."" That sound gag is funnier than any of the sights here. Deploying the 3-D wizardry de rigueur in cartoonland director Tom McGrath insures that donning those damned glasses offers these visual rewards 1) A vast spray of popcorn bursting right into our collective face a not-so-subliminal reminder to visit the concession booth; 2) The usual array of pointy objects with the ante upped to include an entire needle-nosed skyscraper; 3) A curious - some might say unseemly - obsession with Roxannes impressively grown-up and grown-out protuberances. Bespectacled kids of all ages are left to pick their favourite enhancement. Meanwhile reigning solo with no one to fight villainy is facing an ""existential"" crisis. Since a hero cant be found Megamind hits upon an obvious solution He creates one endowing Hal the pudgy slacker (Jonah Hill) with a muscular girth a smorgasbord of superpowers and the nifty new handle of Tighten (love the pun but alas it cant be heard on the screen). But when Tighten proves to have some very loose morals Evil is obliged to cross the spectrum transform himself into the force of Good and do the inevitable - you know save the city see the light get the girl and then get boring sermonizing until hes well bluer in the face. Gotta love the tales moral though which goes exactly like this ""Destiny is not the path given us but the path we choose for ourselves."" Huh? It doesnt take a megamind to parse the contradiction in that little homily. If destiny can be chosen then it aint destiny. Thats the flicks one real feat of cartoon magic It restores the fight between good and evil even while making that other battle between free will and determinism disappear without a trace.

Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 4 2010 625 PM Super Nice Try Why Megamind is the Zune of motion pictures. By Josh Levin Tiny Fey as Roxanne and Will Ferrell as Megamind DreamWorks Animations quest to chase down Pixar calls to mind gadget makers pursuit of Apple. No matter how much gloss the wannabes slather on Steve Jobs old movie studio and Jobs gizmo manufacturer outshine them with a snazzier look and feel and better storytelling. While DreamWorks latest Megamind claims to redefine the superhero movie in reality its the Zune of motion pictures a spiffy well-designed product thats also unmistakably an off-brand imitation. Its no great shame to suffer by comparison to The Incredibles--most movies animated or otherwise dont measure up. Still DreamWorks shouldve been smarter than to tug on Mr. Incredibles cape. (OK Mr. Incredible didnt have a cape. But you get my point.) The inevitable outcome Megamind is an expertly made animated feature that serves to highlight everything Pixar does well. Josh Levin Josh Levin is Slates executive editor. More happily for Jeffrey Katzenberg and Co. Megaminds title character (voiced by Will Ferrell) should prove endearing enough to move some merchandise. In the movies prologue we see Megaminds parents ship their blue bulbous-headed alien newborn to Earth. Thus commences a lifelong struggle to shake his fresh-off-the-spaceship ways. The clueless extraterrestrial has recurring problems with pronunciation such as calling his hometown met-RAW-city rather than Metro City. When he tries to impress his schoolmates by designing a popcorn-making contraption he ignites a towering maize inferno. Advertisement Realizing hes unfit for heroism Megamind decides to embrace his darker side. His recurrent foil is Metro Citys resident demigod Metro Man (Brad Pitt) an unearthly being who fell from the sky into slightly better circumstances. (Megamind dropped into a prison; Metro Man landed inside a mansion.) A cocky fellow who juggles babies for sport and responds to adulation by shouting ""I love you random citizen"" Metro Man flicks away his ill-tempered counterpart with characteristic ease. And then shockingly one of Megaminds evil plans works. (Metro Mans secret weakness copper.) But with his lifelong nemesis out of the picture lording it over Metro City doesnt have the same appeal. ""Without him whats the point?"" Megamind laments. Megaminds shifting mental state comes across thanks to Ferrells voice work which oscillates from sing-songy scheme-hatching to a self-pitying whimper. I also found my eyes drawn to the hints of purple in Megaminds cheeks and ears as he longs for newscaster Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey). Its a small skillful touch that reinforces the blue creatures er humanity--the fact that were looking at a living thing with blood running underneath his blueberry skin. The movies high point isnt proper cheek coloration--Megamind looks great in pretty much every frame. Director Tom McGrath who previously helmed Madagascar treats 3-D as a tool for immersion rather than a tool to separate moviegoers from a few extra bucks. Megaminds set pieces have been well-calibrated to take advantage of the mediums capacity for layering and depth effects without resorting to gimmickry. When Megaminds airborne ""brain bots"" seem to circle the theater its motivated by the plot not a desire for cheap in-your-face thrills. That flying robot army shows why it makes sense to craft a movie around an evil genius from another planet It gives the writers license to dream up pretty much anything they want. (Conan OBrien recently made this observation vis-a-vis The Simpsons Mr. Burns ""Hes a comedy writers fantasy ... whatever we thought of we could make happen."") Megaminds only friend for instance is a fishlike creature named Minion (a perfectly sycophantic David Cross) who trundles around in a humanoid bodysuit thats lined at the joints with plush mammalian fur. Bizarre yet strangely plausible--who else would an alien with a head like an inverted Erlenmeyer flask hang out with? Its Megaminds hints of originality--the protagonist applies black eyeliner and buffs his head before going into battle; a press conference is dotted with passers-by filming the action on cell-phone cameras--that ultimately make it a minor disappointment. Megamind could wield a bajillion different weapons. Why then does he have to ride a vehicle thats so reminiscent of the Mr. Incredible-attacking Omnidroid? Jonah Hills lovelorn Titan also feels painfully similar to The Incredibles Syndrome the wannabe superhero voiced by Jason Lee. There are also borrowings from non-animated fare When Megamind goes on an art museum-defacing rampage it feels less like homage to Jack Nicholsons Joker than the pillaging of a rightly famous scene. Given the medium and the subject matter though the contrast to Pixar is what stands out. Compared with The Incredibles and Up and Ratatouille and Finding Nemo Megamind feels ... cartoonish. Thats somewhat by design. More than Pixars films the DreamWorks oeuvre traffics in slapstick and one-liners. Some of the yuks work--Feys TV reporter opining upon Megaminds takeover ""Are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know""--and some of them dont with Hills wisecracking cameraman-turned-muscleman a particular weak spot. Mostly the jokes and the recurrent attempts to tweak the superhero genre serve as a reminder that somebody else has already done it better. Sure Megamind is pretty good. But why settle for less when you the best is already available on DVD? Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Schoolcraft and Brent Simons didnt have to look far for the inspiration for Megamind the new animated comedy from Paramount Pictures-DreamWorks Animation Its basically Superman  only in this version our hero gets tired of being different (giant blue head pathetic at sports massive trouble with pronunciation of everyday words) and decides that if hes going to be an outcast he might as well get really really good at it and just go for the Evil Villain persona. Movie Information MegamindRatingShowtimes 3D 3D IMAX | Official siteDirector Tom McGrathStarring The voice talents of Will Ferrell Tina Fey Jonah Hill David Cross and Brad PittRun time 96 minutesMPAA rating PG (action and some language)Synopsis What happens when the supervillain (Will Ferrell) defeats the hero (Brad Pitt)? Its an animated answer.More movies from GuideLive.comLike Superman Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) arrives from a distant planet. Hes accompanied only by a little space-fish (in a handy portable aquarium) called Minion (David Cross). Along the way he encounters a similarly castoff space-baby boy who will become his archenemy the heroically muscled (if none too bright) Metro Man (Brad Pitt). Metro Mans little spaceship deposits him directly under the Christmas tree of a McMansion-residing couple. Megaminds bounces off course dumping him in a cityscape that resembles something youd see after a major earthquake.As a grown-up Megamind passes his time in Metro City (which he pronounces ""Metrocity"" like ""atrocity"") by serially kidnapping adorable reporter Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) who has become so accustomed to these interludes that no amount of snapping crocodiles spinning saws or various other threats can faze her. ""Can I just get my Frequent Kidnapping Card stamped?"" she ponders bored by the whole thing.When Megamind actually does do away with Metro Man to everyones astonishment (including his own) the ennui of having no good force to counter his evil quickly thwarts his joie de vivre. He decides to create a hero picking Roxannes dimwitted camera guy (Jonah Hill) as his Frankenstein monster. And you know what happens with monsters Sometimes they get their own ideas of whats fun. Chaos of course ensues with the biggest battle inside Megamind Is he a villain? A hero? Just a guy with a really tragic complexion?The animation here is amazing; the crowd scenes look like throngs of actual people and the facial expressions are so lifelike theyre a little disconcerting. As my husband noted its just like watching a real actor - albeit one with a giant blue head (and darling little pinkish-purple ears which let you know early on that hes not as evil as hed like us to believe). I find it annoying that a cartoon heroine can so bewitchingly arch an eyebrow in disdain while I - who have real muscles - have yet to master that myself.Ferrell Fey and Hill acquit themselves hilariously and Cross steals the movie as Minion the wide-eyed wide-mouthed fishy - well minion (and brains) - behind Megamind. This movies not up there with the Disney and Pixar greats but it certainly continues DreamWorks Animations rapid advancement in the art form.If the various animation companies keep producing work of this caliber we may see a not-so-distant Academy Awards with more animation than live films in the best-picture category. editor picks Nailing down the Horseshoe Assembling Dallas latest Calatrava arches Get out Hit the ground running (or cycling) on these D-FW trails Music Find out concerts places with great music and more Alex from Target Internet sensation from Frisco to act in movie featuring Plano teens with cystic fibrosis Comments To post a comment log into your chosen social network and then add your comment below.

"Megamind Its a bird its a plane its a riff | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesMegamind Its a bird its a plane its a riffThe superhero parody Megamind is a comic pile-on that riffs on Superman and many other pop-cult attractions.Will Ferrell and Tina Fey are the voices behind Megamind and Roxanne.By Peter HowellMovie CriticThu. Nov. 4 2010Megamind (out of 4)Animated comedy featuring the voices of Will Ferrell Brad Pitt Tina Fey Jonah Hill and David Cross. Directed by Tom McGrath. At major theatres. 96 minutes. PGMegamind isnt so much a movie as it is a pop cultural pile-on. This animated superhero parody makes so many zippy references to film music and other mass obsessions its like watching stand-up comedians trade riffs with each other on a Just For Laughs stage.Article Continued BelowThe head fairly spins as the bits fly by an Obama pun here a Karate Kid gag there a Marlon Brando impression somewhere else all of it more for adults than for kids.With the exception of Brad Pitt who is capable of hilarity most of the principal voices actually are veteran stand-up and/or sketch comics. Will Ferrell is the titular villain a big-domed blue genius who just wants the world to obey him -- or else. Tina Fey is red-hot TV reporter Roxanne. Jonah Hill is her fawning (and transforming) cameraman Hal. Cross is Megaminds chucklesome chief stooge Minion some kind of ape with a fish for a head. Pitt is Metro Man a flying hunk and lunk who defends truth liberty and the American way in a concrete burg called Metro City.If this all sounds a lot like Superman then kazam It even begins with a straight lift from Supes saga the exploding planet thing where a baby is sent by rocket to Earth by perishing parents so he can escape their fate.The mild twist here is that there are two exploding planets and two ejected infants one is a blue-tinted mischief maker who will grow up to become Megamind; the other is an ivory-hued and silver-spooned ""Goody Two-Shoes"" who will one day fly in tights over Metro City using the clever moniker Metro Man.The difference in their destiny owes as much to circumstance as it does to DNA. Megaminds capsule lands in a maximum-security prison where cons adopt the tot and teach him that two wrongs definitely make a right. Metro Mans can glides into the mansion of a couple who pay their taxes say their prayers and are entirely devoid of irony.Megamind enjoys being bad mainly because hes been given no other choice. He has Lex Luthors ability to make sinister contraptions out of any old junk he finds. But he also possesses Wile E. Coyotes rotten luck for having his contraptions implode fizzle and otherwise crap out. Speaking of bad luck he cant even get one scream out of seen-it-all Roxy whom he keeps getting Minion to kidnap for him.You could say that Megamind is a tad resentful about good vs. evil inequities -- ""Good receives all the praise and adulation while evil spends quiet time in the corner"" -- and hes especially miffed when he learns that Metro City is erecting a giant statue and museum in honor of Metro Man who is one dumb hero.Maybe things would be different if Megamind didnt keep trying to destroy Metro City? But suddenly hes forced to confront the possibility of having no good yang to his evil yin while another bumbling baddie starts to shake up the city. Will Megamind become green with envy and will Roxy see red or turn blue?Megamind is as fresh as week-old mackerel and it really pongs in the soundtrack department. There ought to be a statue of limitations against using George Thorogoods ""Bad to the Bone"" and AC/DCs ""Highway to Hell"" in a movie which ceased being novel around the time of the Reagan Administration. Michael Jacksons ""Bad"" also gets an obvious spin but it almost seems new because Jackos jukebox was so long in the doghouse.But if its difficult to find novelty in Megamind its also hard not to like. The always eager Ferrell adopts a high-pitched accent mindful of Steve Carells Gru from Despicable Me and screenwriters Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons supply many good lines for him and other characters to riff on. Tom McGrath directs with the same ensemble energy he brought to the Madagascar series.The characters are key here just as they were in Monsters vs. Aliens which was also made by DreamWorks Animation. That film was similarly shy of new ideas but the characters were colourful enough to make the mandatory sequels seem promising as long as theres a good story to go with them.Likewise the future of Megamind could be up up and away if DreamWorks gets that important detail right.Read more about Brad Pitt Will FerrellThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

WATCH VIDEO below of star Ferrell. (Paramount/AP) Joe Neumaier Thursday November 4 2010 918 AM Title Megamind A villain must become good after he defeats his heroic rival. With the voices of Will Ferrell Tina Fey Brad Pitt. Directed by Tom McGrath. (1360 PG Violence. At area theaters.The blue-tinged huge-headed titular villain of ""Megamind"" has a habit of mispronouncing things -- for instance he calls Metro City where he lives ""metrocity"" (rhymes with ""atrocity"") and school comes out like ""shh-chool"" -- and so it seems only fair to sum this movie up in a similar way.While not quite an a-boom-ination it is certainly a sham-e. A real Disapp Ointment. A floop.Youd expect part of the fun of this DreamWorks computer-animated family film to be the voices of Will Ferrell Brad Pitt and Tina Fey. But these three megastars are the only fun in ""Megamind"" which plays out like a clunky not-so-incredible ""Incredibles"" or a more-despicable ""Despicable Me."" It looks great and starts out with the right feel and attitude but never really takes flight.The adventures of ""Megamind"" begin where most superhero tales end with the brainiac baddie (Ferrell) trapping his do-gooder nemesis Metro Man (Pitt) while holding girl reporter Roxanne (Fey) hostage. But then it appears Metro Man has truly been killed leaving Megamind and his fish-headed pal Minion (David Cross) in control of Metro City. Megamind and Metro Man have had a lifelong rivalry -- they came to Earth in spaceships Superman-style and have forever been at opposite ends of the popularity spectrum -- yet with no one to measure himself against Megamind is at a loss.So he clones Metro Mans DNA accidentally injecting it into Hal (voiced by Jonah Hill) the schlubby cameraman whos in love with Roxanne. As Hal flexes his super-muscles Megamind dons various disguises and falls for Roxie. Then Hal decides that actually hes the nasty one forcing Megamind to seek truth and justice and his inner hero.Its not hard to appreciate Megamind as a cartoony creation -- in addition to Ferrells nimble inflections his giant cranium rests on a stick-thin body and under his boomerang eyebrows he has huge green eyes that well up when hes sad. But kids under 6 may have a hard time with his changing personas -- a nerdy librarian an extended riff that has him imitating Marlon Brando-as-Jor-El -- and Hals reversal isnt exactly handled with Pixarian complexityMiddle-School boys are the target audience for the shifting personalities robot minions and building-smashings. People above that age will mostly just endure it all and smile at Ferrells oh-so-nasty intonations Pitts extended cameo and Feys brusque brush-offs. The rest of ""Megamind"" is a megawaste.

ABOUT THE MOVIEMegamind  out of four Voices Will Ferrell Tina Fey Brad Pitt Jonah Hill David CrossDirector Tom McGrathDistributor ParamountRating PG for action and some languageRunning time 1 hour 36 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Do we really need Megamind when Despicable Me is around? Even cuing up The Incredibles for another viewing offers more enjoyment. Megamind has some funny moments silly mispronunciations and comical socio-political references. But it suffers from being the second animated movie this year to feature a dastardly villain for a hero. TRAILER Watch Megamind Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell) is a hero by default. Born on a distant planet with a bulbous blue head he is sent off as a baby to find his destiny on Earth. He crash-lands in a prison where he is raised by hardened criminals who teach him a thing or two about evil. At the same time another infant from a faraway galaxy sets off on a similar quest but he is raised by wealthy loving parents. The privileged baby grows up to become the swaggering and fabulous Metro Man (Brad Pitt) hero of Metro City. As a bumbling sweet kid Megamind figures out that if hes misunderstood and bullied he might as well be bad anyway. Ferrell is a clever choice for Megamind and his vocal stylings are a highlight. His comical homage to Marlon Brando as Jor-El from 1978s Superman is a hoot and his garbled pronunciation of school and Metro City are reminiscent of Ferrells goofy riff on San Diego in Anchorman. Pitts Metro Man has just the right element of vain puffery. Joining the mix is Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) as a plucky reporter a la Lois Lane whom both men are sweet on. Indeed a third guy geeky Hal (Jonah Hill) her slacker cameraman also pines for Roxanne. When Megamind appears to finally vanquish Metro Man the blue-headed baddie soon grows bored despite the loyal ministrations of his fishy sidekick Minion (David Cross). Whats a villain without a hero to terrorize? He has decimated the city but itches for more challenges. So he creates a replacement foe injecting Metro Mans DNA into the first schlub he encounters Hal. But of course things dont go as planned. The wisecracking banter between Roxanne and Megamind is cute but not memorable. The whole undertaking while amiable is derivative. Megaminds computer-animated design is attractive. But the 3-D is generally superfluous nothing like the soaring integral use of the technique in DreamWorks more superior adventure How to Train Your Dragon. But mostly its the thin ultra-familiar story that keeps Megamind from soaring. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Standards Editor Brent Jones.

"Movie review Megamind - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-SupermanMovie review MegamindWill Ferrell leads a talented voice cast in the clever amusing enough 3-D animated supervillain / superhero comedy.November 05 2010|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Will Ferrell is the voice of Megamind center. David Cross is the voice of... (DreamWorks Animation )A big blue head and an even bigger ego seem to suit Will Ferrell who gives voice to the villainous star of the amusing new 3-D animated comedy ""Megamind."" DreamWorks latest pop-culture manifesto is out to skewer celebrity the cult of superhero fandom media feeding frenzies and to suggest that perhaps what you really need to save the day is not a cape but the love of a good woman. The story takes the Superman mythology and then fractures it considerably. It begins for our two central characters Megamind and Metro Man ( Brad Pitt) as it did for the legendary Clark Kent a dying planet popped in a pod as a baby landing on Earth adopted by kind strangers. Luck is not with the blue boy who lands at Metro City prison where the inmates take him in; for Metro Man its a nice house in the suburbs with a mom a dad and all the amenities. How could they not grow up to be rivals? FOR THE RECORD ""Megamind"" review In the Nov. 5 Calendar section a review of the film ""Megamind"" whose title character is voiced by actor Will Ferrell said that one of the pleasures of the film ""is that Megamind doesnt really sound like Ferrell."" The article went on to say that ""the filmmakers have walked away from Ferrells comic talents."" It should have said ""That doesnt mean the filmmakers have walked away from Ferrells comic talents."" a But the larger question the filmmakers are soon onto is what happens to the bad guy when the good guy is out of the picture. What is the price of media adulation? Why do we always expect someone else to solve our problems? Well its complicated but so au courant. Without going all biblical on you apparently evil doesnt work so well without good and gulp vice versa and most of the film unfolds around Megamind trying to resolve that issue. Its a case of being careful what you wish for. The problem for our charming villain besides his secret crush on Roxanne ( Tina Fey) is that as soon as he discovers that copper is Metro Mans kryptonite poof (imagine an extended action scene here with lots of things including L.A.s iconic Griffith Observatory going up in flames) the good guy is gone and life is anything but what he expected. Hopelessly infatuated with Roxanne and hopelessly bored with being bad Megamind conjures up a new nemesis and once again the battle roars to life although there are a few surprises along the way. Virtually all of the characters extend the Superman theme though lightly roasted (think Friars Club) by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons script their first to be produced. Pitts Metro Man is muscle-bound perfection in white tights the protector of Metro City which looks very much like downtown L.A. Feys Roxanne is a TV reporter who tracks the good-versus-evil goings-on around town; Jonah Hill is her nerdy cameraman Hal before an accidental shot of superpowers turns him into a very tightly wound supersized mistake named Tighten. Ben Stiller rounds things out as the studious Bernard complete with glasses and a shoulder for Lois um I mean Roxanne to lean on. The only thing missing is the phone booth. (Stiller and his partner Stuart Cornfeld are executive producers on the film.) With Roxanne around love is in the air but there are no worries for parents The subtexts here are of the more cerebral sort. Case in point is Minion (an excellent David Cross) essentially Megaminds personal assistant. The name is clever wordplay for grown-ups the look is funny fish in need of serious dental work for kids. Though the films subtleties dont always work they do often enough. Plus its a relief not to have to explain away those dicey innuendos so often slipped into animated fare. Director Tom McGrath who has been behind DreamWorks ""Madagascar"" successes keeps the effects popping but more impressive than the multi-dimensions is ""Megaminds"" minimalist modernist look. It creates a crispness that feels more contemporary than retro which not only is very aesthetically pleasing but makes it easier to savor the films many sight gags. Of course central to the cachet of any animated flick now is lining up an A-list of high-wattage voice talent. So it comes as a surprise that one of the pleasures of ""Megamind"" is that Megamind doesnt really sound like Ferrell. It allows our villain an interesting character arc without the distraction of a voice so etched in the public consciousness that most of us could recognize it with our eyes closed (Buddy the Elf? Ron Burgundy?). Like the animation style Ferrell goes minimalist adopting a bit of a highbrow tone that he never loses even when hes badly mispronouncing words a the emphasis is always on the wrong syllable. That doesnt mean the filmmakers have walked away from Ferrells comic talents. A high-tech watch allows Megamind to suddenly morph into someone else which opens the door for the comic to go crazy with impressions. The best is Brando with a white shock of hair and a sly reference that ""Superman"" fans at least will appreciate. Restraint works well for Ferrell and Cross but over-the-top fits Hills crazed Tighten the nemesis Megamind finds he needs. In the rather bland middle is Fey and sadly Pitt who is simply better in the flesh. Just as Megamind struggles to find his center at times so does the film. I guess its just not easy being blue.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""Megamind"" is a genial animated sendup of superhero flicks that should appeal to kids around the age when theyre getting a bit cynical about do-gooders in capes and tights. The film centers on the rivalry between a skinny self-proclaimed evil genius with a globular head (Will Ferrell) and brawny square-jawed demigod Metro Man (Brad Pitt). Rivals since their birth in a galaxy far away they have been competing for attention for decades Metro Man by being perfect Megamind by acting out. Hes not really nefarious you see hes just misunderstood. In other circumstances he might have been a good guy; hes literally bumped off in a different path. Jealous of Metro Mans popularity with Metro Citys citizens -- and with TV reporter Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) -- he tries to eradicate the goody-goody with doomsday machines that always backfire Wile E. Coyote-style. Then to his amazement he succeeds. And he doesnt know what to do with himself. And he misses the good guy. And his life changes. The story takes a while to find its way after Metro Mans departure but it compensates by moving off in interesting new directions. Without getting too deep into spoiler territory lets note that Roxanne is also the name of the heroine of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" another tale of a smart odd-looking neurotic with a hidden romantic nature and a flair for wacky disguises. Roxanne seems to stir up romantic passions in every man she meets including her overeager cameraman (Jonah Hill) a Jimmy Olson type who goes through some dramatic changes of his own. The look of the film is fine with cleverly designed retro skyscrapers and super-vehicles. Its the nicely worked-out plot that surprises though. Story is usually the weak link in DreamWorks films where pop-culture gags and musical numbers typically carry the day. This time theres a structure big reversals and a strong finale. For fans of the Richard Donner ""Superman"" movies theres even a hammy Brando-inflected turn by Ferrell as Metro Mans white-haired Space Dad. ""Megamind"" wont revolutionize the genre but it gives it a goose.

Thats a no-brainerMegamind joined by sidekick Minion battles Metro Man for supremacy on the streets of Metro City - and in the heart of Roxanne Ritchi.By Steven Rea Inquirer Movie CriticPosted November 05 2010With an origin story borrowed from Superman an elaborate lair borrowed from Batman and a skin complexion borrowed from a robins egg Megamind - the title character of DreamWorks Animations smart snappy superhero send-up - is a villain to love.Well unless youre one of the cowering citizens of Metro City in which case youre going to hate the guy. An evil genius obsessed with besting his goody-two-shoes caped-crusader nemesis Megamind is a misfit a braggart and a guy who doesnt think twice about upending skyscrapers firing off death rays and generally terrorizing the populace. (He also pronounces Metro City as if it were one word and rhymed with atrocity.)With Will Ferrell providing the voice of Megamind; Brad Pitt as the um cartoonishly heroic Metro Man; Tina Fey as plucky TV news reporter Roxanne Ritchi - Metro Mans gal pal of course; and Jonah Hill as the TV cameraman geek-turned-demented-baddie Tighten Megamind crackles with wit. When cheering throngs assemble before the San Francisco-like City Hall to hail their jut-jawed super-savior someone yelps ""I love you Metro Man""""And I love you random citizen"" is his jaunty response.And the ridiculously cute Roxanne once again abducted by Megamind in his (up to now) fruitless effort to lure Metro Man to his doom quips in mock weariness about her ""frequent kidnapping card.""The movies visual wit is evident in its salutes to the likes of Fritz Langs Metropolis and Rube Goldbergs famously complicated contraptions. Megamind - in theaters in 3-D (baby spittle comin at ya) and 2-D versions - owes something too to Brad Birds The Incredibles. The films share a cheeky but affectionate approach to comic-book mythologies and a keen sense of design. Megamind isnt as inventive but its fun and funny stuff.Director Tom McGrath who worked on the furiously antic Ren amp; Stimpy Show before helming the Madagascar hits opens Megamind with its titular (anti-)heros narration as we watch the blue-skinned brainiac with the billboard-size forehead plummeting to his death. Neatly explaining how he arrived in Metro City (you know the drill exploding planet baby placed in capsule lands on Earth) and how he was raised in a prison for ""the criminally gifted"" Megamind goes on to describe his rivals origins pretty much the same (exploding planet baby in capsule new home on Earth) except that Metro Man grows up happily and happily doing good. The two have been at each other since their school days.Megamind has momentum and dazzle. The rivalry for Roxannes affections becomes especially complicated when Hal the TV cameraman gets his superpowers and superhero costume to become Tighten. And Megamind finding himself falling for Roxanne morphs into a charmingly bookish bespectacled fellow named Bernard. That courtship doesnt quite work out as planned.But never mind. Megamind works out fine..Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| Text size - + Whenever you see behind-the-scenes footage of actors recording their voice work for animated movies they look like they just woke up. For the most part they dont sound rumpled or hung over. Once the filmmakers finish applying dialogue to what the animators have done you wonder why some live actors cant be as uninhibited in the flesh. I thought that about Brad Pitt while I watched a flamboyantly noble superhero named Metro Man speak in Pitts voice for ""Megamind a deliriously handsome Dreamworks comedy that opens today. Pitts voice has rarely sounded as if hes enjoying himself this much.Metro Man is charmingly cocky. He has a full head of inky hair with a delightful tab of gray for each sideburn. The gloves of his costume are trimmed with fringe. You could open beer bottles with his chin and rake tiny leaves with his faint crows feet. The metropolis he protects -- Metro City -- has just built for him what amounts to a shrine. And the attention only seems to make his weightless physique even puffier. This is a joke on the kind of star Pitt never was and I guess thats part of the liberty he feels in lending his voice to the gag. He sounds happy because he turned out to be someone else.The bliss of ""Megamind is the way it pursues solutions for tired problems. Take that title. Its not ""Metro Man. Megamind is Metro Mans increasingly pitiful archenemy and you have to hand it to a movie with the good sense to know that the bad guy is more interesting. Excusing Robert Downey Jr.s Iron Man its always true yet never acknowledged. The movie called ""Megamind turns out to be all about Megamind.Hes prone to mispronunciation (he puts the stress on the wrong syllables; ""Metro City for instance rhymes with ""atrocity). Megamind is thin and blue where Metro Man is thick and white. He has the sort of giant head only Cadbury could love (crack it open and fondant might ooze out). The voice belongs to Will Ferrell who like Pitt sees the role as an opportunity to have a new kind of fun. Ferrell softens and slightly anglicizes Megamind the way a Peter Sellers impersonator might. Like Sellers (or Mike Myers) Ferrell winds up playing a pair of other characters too. One of them confirms how Marlon Brandos baby with Conan OBrien would look like Paul Lynde in Parliament.Ferrells freshness belies the movies primary challenge How do you make a big entertainment about monotony and dissatisfaction? Everything about Metro City is generic. Megamind calls his base of operations ""evil lair. His sidekick -- a talking fish in a bowl atop a large mechanical primate body -- is Minion (David Cross at his very best). The movie knows what its cliches are and uses mockery to avoid most of them. Megamind escapes from prison resumes terrorizing Metro City kidnaps Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) the citys Lois Lane and possibly eliminates Metro Man. Fey has a good time with a role that for once allows her to be as consistently self-confident as she should be elsewhere. Roxanne is an anti-distress damsel. She rolls her eyes at Megaminds bag of terror tricks and asks him to please stamp her frequent hostage card.She the filmmakers and maybe even a few of the kids in the audience have seen it all before -- the comic book the film based on the comic book the winking that certain movies based on comic books start to do after a few sequels. Directed by the animator Tom McGrath ""Megamind is well-versed in superhero routine without turning blase. The boredom of formulas and roles and expectations is very much its point.With Metro Man out of the picture ennui creeps over Megamind who like every male here has a thing for Roxanne. What will he do to occupy his genius? His evil is like part of a chemical reaction. Supervillainy works only in the presence of superheroism. Our resident baddie might not recall the terminology from college but he misses his dialectic counterpoint. That lightbulb of a head doesnt work without a socket. So in a ""Frankenstein plot Megamind concocts a foil -- he turns Roxannes nerdy cameraman (Jonah Hill) into a WWE wrestler -- hoping to stoke his sense of enmity before it becomes vestigial. Also a la ""Frankenstein His scheme produces romantic disaster.All the wit in Brent Simons and Alan J. Schoolcrafts script is matched by the sort of painstaking visual ingenuity that makes most live-action production seem lazy with cynicism. One allusion to Donkey Kong suggests a universe of heritage gaming references that animated movies have yet to make. Two characters fence using street lamps. And Megaminds vast army of floating mini-minion orbs look like sci-fi shad roe but turn out to be a battalion of peevish LEDs that constitute museum-quality airborne stagecraft. The movie is about the problem of having seen it all before yes. But it doesnt treat us as though we have.Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorrisglobe.com.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Most decent kids entertainment blends material for older and younger viewers. But DreamWorks latest CGI movie Megamind pushes this dynamic weirdly far squarely targeting viewers wholl catch jokes based on the original Donkey Kong or recognize Marlon Brando from Superman or Pat Morita from Karate Kid. The tone draws heavily on wryly postmodern self-aware send-ups like The Venture Bros. and its so packed with references familiar to longtime superhero aficionados that smaller viewers may not be sure what theyre seeing apart from bickering and explosions. Theres nothing wrong with animation aimed at adults but this may be the first kids movie that throws fewer bones to its supposed intended viewers than to their parents. The film begins with two infants rocketing toward Earth in an echo of Supermans origin. From the start their stories are linked Radically different childhoods lead Megamind (Will Farrell) to become a villain and Metro Man (Brad Pitt) to become a hero but they define each other and give each other purpose. Then Megamind actually wins their lifelong battle and has to figure out what his life means in a world no longer defined by the ongoing conflict. The idea is both smarter than it could have been and less ambitious. Director Tom McGrath (who co-helmed both Madagascar movies) and first-time screenwriters Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons give the material a melancholic depth The idea that superheroes and villains are locked in codependent relationships has been around for decades but again Megamind takes it to unexpected lengths as the aimless victorious Megamind essentially turns into a grieving widow. It doesnt go far enough to say anything new about the idea though; the storys beats are obvious. Theres a fine line between closely following archetypes and embracing cliche and Megamind doesnt always wind up on the right side of that line. Still it pours on the humor while finding a comfortable sophistication in Megaminds relationships with his buddy/servant Minion (David Cross) and crush object Roxanne (Tina Fey) and offering a less cloying take on the ""Villains are basically just stylish daring heroes"" dynamic that Despicable Me worked this past summer. Children may not love Megamind but at least they can bond with mom and dad afterward when they explain who Brando was.

"Heroes and villains A wash of color cant perk up tired plot lines - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Heroes and villains A wash of color cant perk up tired plot linesMegamind a 2 1/2 starsNovember 04 2010|By Michael Phillips | Tribune movie critic (Will Ferrell lends his voice to the main character in ""Megamind."")Earlier this year ""Despicable Me"" proved it A story about a hapless villain humanized is good for a few laughs and a half-billion worldwide. That figure would very likely be A-OK with the makers of the new DreamWorks animated feature ""Megamind"" also about a hapless villain humanized. This villains blue. Moderately funny though immoderately derivative the film is no ""How to Train Your Dragon"" or "" Kung Fu Panda"" DreamWorks recent high points and its more about attitude than it is about jokes. Welcome to the early 21st century. Somewhere around the time ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" became a huge success ""wit"" in quotes became wittier than wit without the quotes. Will Ferrell is the voice of Megamind; Brad Pitt less crucial to the story offers up the voice (and the supernaturally attractive aura) of Metro Man defender of Metro City slightly smug in his fabulousness. Like all sorts of comics-derived material before it ""Megamind"" concerns the insecurities and doubts of those who arent expected to have such things. An immigrant from another galaxy raised by hardened criminals Megamind wages attempt after attempt to take over Metro City with the aid of his minion Minion (a fishlike critter in a space helmet voiced rather sweetly by David Cross). When he appears to defeat Metro Man everything changes. Like Scar in ""The Lion King"" Megamind turns his homeland into a dump. Trying to get the old adversarial magic back he trains a new rival ( Jonah Hill voicing Hal a TV cameraman moony over the on-air reporter voiced by Tina Fey). Megaminds new rival acquires superpowers but uses them for uncontrollable evil rather than controllable evil. Bits and pieces come and go either vaguely or directly inspired by ""The Dark Knight"" (an attack on City Hall); ""The Incredibles"" (hopeless nerd becomes destructive tantrum-prone dastard); the Richard Donner "" Superman"" (Ferrell disguises himself as Marlon Brando playing Jor-El); and various other uncredited sources. You have seen all this before. Screenwriters Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons do a few things right starting with the decision to make the Megamind/Minion relationship genuinely affectionate. That helps you through the saggy middle section and later when the action sequences start sitting on the plot. Then again my son wouldve preferred more of those (the action scenes that is). He also wouldve preferred chase sequences in which now and then whomevers being chased by whatever down a city street simply makes a sharp right turn. ""This is the thing I hate about a lot of movies"" he told me on the way out. ""Why dont they just turn?"" Perhaps someday well see it an animated feature ruled by ruthless logic and iron-clad plausibility whatever the villains color. mjphillipstribune.com MPAA rating PG (for action and some language) Voice cast Will Ferrell (Megamind); Brad Pitt (Metro Man); Tina Fey (Roxanne Ritchi); Jonah Hill (Hal); David Cross (Minion) Credits Directed by Tom McGrath; written by Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons; produced by Lara Breay and Denise Nolan Cascino.

"Megamind | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; megamind ) Megamind (United States 2010) November 02 2010 A movie review by James Berardinelli [Seen in ""standard"" (non-IMAX) 3-D.] Megamind is largely what one might expect from an animated movie featuring a number of notable comedians in voice roles an amusing diversion. A soft satire of superhero films (one thats less clever than either Pixars The Incredibles or Universals more recent Despicable Me) Megamind falls into the second tier animated category. Its not on the same level as Pixars best but is a perfectly acceptable family feature with a lively pace and sufficient cartoonishness to engage children while not boring their accompanying parents to death. Superman references abound from the beginning as little Megamind (voice of Will Ferrell) is sent to Earth in a space capsule to escape a dying planet. Later theres a more explicit nod to the 1978 movie as Will Ferrell performs a credibly fatuous Marlon Brando impersonation (adults will get this; kids will not but it doesnt matter). Megamind who has blue skin and a big head isnt the only alien to arrive on our planet. At the same time the boy who will grow up to become Metro Man shows up in a superior capsule. Hes a clean-cut all-American kid whose adult version has the squarest jaw imaginable and sounds like George Clooney (even though his voice is provided by Brad Pitt). Megamind becomes the supervillain arch-nemesis to Metro Mans superhero. Their battles which often begin with Megamind capturing TV news reporter Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) typically end with Metro Man carting Megamind off to jail. Then suddenly one day one of Megaminds schemes works and Metro City loses its hero. After a brief period of exultation Megamind comes to a stunning realization without Metro Man theres little point to his existence. The ying to his yang is gone; theres no more salt to his pepper. So he sets about creating a new superhero out of a schlub cameraman named Hal (Jonah Hill). Hal however is a shallow self-absorbed individual and the experiment doesnt go as planned - imagine giving the abilities of a god to a creepy introverted dweeb. Its evident from the content that Will Ferrell either had an uncredited hand in writing the script or did a fair amount of ad-libbing. Some of the comedy and more than a few of Megaminds lines have the comedians fingerprints all over them (such as the frequent mispronunciation of words). Obviously given the PG rating none of the humor is off-color but it is frequently sophomoric and as such generally works within the context of an animated movie. In general Megaminds comedy is effective although not hilarious. This is more a movie of smiles than belly-laughs. The ""dramatic"" elements such as Megaminds conversion from villain to hero provoke little emotional reaction. That aspect prevents Megamind from ascending to the upper echelon of animated motion pictures. The images are composed to titillate the eye. A dark rain-drenched scene is breathtaking in both detail and impact. The 3-D is innocuous. The movie does not suffer from blurring but there is a reduction in the vibrancy of colors. The 3-D occasionally calls attention to itself by hurling something in the direction of the viewer but for the most part its unobtrusive enough not to be a distraction. Since it neither enhances nor detracts from the experience why pay the surcharge? The movie should play equally well in 2-D (if it can be found playing in 2-D). Megamind will succeed at the box office. It has been assembled by Tom McGrath who made Madagascar and Madagascar 2 both of which were popular with families. If anything Megamind boasts a smarter sharper screenplay and doesnt play as aggressively to the youngest potential members of the audience. The voice acting by Will Ferrell Brad Pitt (sounding as mentioned above like a puffed-up George Clooney) Tina Fey and Jonah Hill is top-notch; the music (mostly 80s heavy metal) is well-selected; and the style is clean and uncluttered. Its a pleasant if unspectacular animated motion picture that will appeal to a variety of viewers.

Where does he go from there? Megamind Fair Director Tom McGrath. Cast Will Ferrell Brad Pitt Tina Fey. Rating Rated PG for action and some language. Qamp;A with Tina Fey Supervillains we love | Superheroes we love Those are the questions at the heart of ""Megamind"" DreamWorks Animations latest film. The answer evidently is to let Will Ferrell goof around in a funny voice for an hour and a half. Oh wait. Different question. The answer is umm do a lot of soul-searching and strive on secure in the knowledge that theres someone out there even badder than you are. But disagreeable as it may sound to say so weve reached the point where the Ferrell shtick is starting to wear thin. Actually its possible that happened a few movies ago but it certainly applies here. While the idea is a clever take on the superhero story and the cast first-rate - it also includes Brad Pitt Tina Fey and David Cross - after a while the studied silliness of Ferrell and his voice and his tics and mannerisms is just too much. Its easy to say with a ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnus involved that at times ""Megamind"" plays like an ""SNL"" skit that goes on a little too long. So lets say it. Megamind and Metro Man (Pitt) were born on a far-away doomed planet and sent to earth by their respective sets of parents Superman-style. But Metro Man winds up in a loving home in Metro City while Megaminds capsule lands in prison. That kind of environment is difficult to overcome. For years their lives play out with predictability. The hapless Megamind with the help of his evil fish Minion (Cross) kidnaps bored TV reporter Roxanne Ritchi (Fey) Metro Man saves her repeat repeat repeat. Until one day when Megamind in a development that surprises him as much as anyone does the unthinkable He wins. He vanquishes Metro Man leaving Metro City helpless and at his disposal. Sounds ideal for a villain sure but it proves to be a hollow victory as Megamind discovers that he lost his sense of purpose when he lost his enemy. A plan to create a new hero goes awry creating from Roxannes sad-sack cameraman Hal (Jonah Hill) a villain more evil or at least crankier than Megamind ever was. Now Megamind must team with Roxanne to save the city he had so much fun trying to destroy. If youre counting the film so far racks up allusions to ""Despicable Me"" ""The Incredibles"" and pretty much every superhero movie ever made. Still it looks great with effective use of 3D bringing Metro City to life. Pitts not around much but Fey is good as Roxanne and Hill funny as the laziest super-powered slacker in history. But this is Ferrells movie meaning some inspired laughs sandwiched between annoying bits that stretch on well past their usefulness. As were learning from movies like ""Land of the Lost"" ""Semi-Pro"" and ""The Goods Live Hard Sell Hard"" a little of Farrell goes an increasingly long way. ""Megamind"" doesnt do anything to dispel that notion. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter twitter.com/goodyk.

"Movie Review ""Megamind"" | Movie Nation Movie Nation Filmgoing movie loving and a good argument. On a good day. Skip to content - Movie Review ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" is Woody at his weakest Oscars Todays interview ""Gatekeepers"" director Dror Moreh - Movie Review ""Megamind"" Posted on January 28 2013      by rogerinorlando There are rules to this super-hero/super-villain game and theyre laid out by the title character in the chatty new animated adventure comedy ""Megamind"" starring Will Ferrell. ""Good receives all the praise and adulation. Evil is sent for quiet time in the corner."" More to the point notes Megamind whatever perks come with heroes and bad guys ""The bad dont get the girl."" Ferrell provides the title characters mustache-twirling voice in this farce about an alien baby who grew up to be Metroman and the alien baby who grew up on Earth to be his nemesis -- Megamind. Brad Pitt voices Metroman the toothy hero who bathes in applause and thwarts the hapless Megamind at every turn. Megamind is so clueless he cant even pronounce the name of their hometown correctly. ""Metrocity"" sounds like ""atrocity"" coming out of his pursed blue mouth. The plucky TV reporter Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) documents Metromans heroics and always figures in Megaminds evil plans. ""Could someone stamp my Frequent Kidnapping Card?"" But what would happen if this equilibrium were shattered if Megamind were to finally win a fight and do Metroman in? Thats the central conceit of this Dreamworks (3D) toon. How would Megamind cope? The answer is not very well. Once youve looted the city enslaved its inhabitants and covered every free space with your ""No You Cant"" posters (a play on the Obama posters of 2008) what more is there? ""Whats the point of being bad if theres no good to stop you?"" There are a few similarities to last summers funnier and sweeter ""Despicable Me"" and even more ideas teased out of ""The Incredibles."" Megaminds plans include creating a new superhero (voiced by Jonah Hill) so that hell have a foil somebody he can impress Roxanne by besting in battles of wits. Like many an overly talkative cartoon the energy flags here as the funnier lines thin out sometime after Megamind sneers ""Im shaking in my custom made baby sealskin boots"" Filler musical montages set to ""Bad to the Bone"" ""Dirty Deeds"" and ""Highway to Hell"" dont quite cover the dead spots. But the message about ""learning from your mistakes"" is kid-appropriate. And the voice casting is on the money and these funny people -- and Im including Pitt who plays this sort of self-mocking Adonis well even in animated form -- make this cute comedy come off. Even if we like Megamind start to wonder ""Whats the point?"" after Metromans exit. Cast The voices of Will Ferrell Brad Pitt Tina Fey and Jonah Hill Director Tom McGrath Running time 1 hour 35 minutes Rating PG for action and some language.

Im not quite sure what the trend adds up to but could it be that evil in kiddie flicks has finally become innocuous? Considering that Toy Story 3 had one of the great villains of the year (Lotso the bear) I would say no. Megamind is less a satire of dastardly deeds than a nimbly spectacular comedy of ego. Ferrells Megamind who was shot to Earth as an infant a la Superman is like Dr. Evil crossed with the old Flintstones mascot the Great Gazoo and Ferrell voices him with an amused vaguely British superciliousness. (He pronounces Metro City where the movie is set so that it rhymes with atrocity.) His rival Metro Man (Brad Pitt) is a preposterously noble lantern-jawed fusion of Elvis and Mr. Incredible who has a way of always defeating Megamind. Until Megamind finally beats him. Thats when the movie really takes off. Bored with being on top Megamind decides to create his own righteous antagonist by infusing special powers into the body of a doltish cameraman (Jonah Hill who charges the film with gnashing neurotic glee). Both end up vying for the affections of the spunky news babe Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey). Unlike the recent DreamWorks Animation hit How to Train Your Dragon Megamind is too goofy-surreal to pack a lot of emotional punch but its antically light on its feet with 3-D images that have a lustrous gizmo-mad sci-fi clarity. The movie is a burlesque on the layered identities of heroes and villains who in Megamind share one big thing Theyre all superheroes of self-promotion.

(""Same story as Despicable Me"" said the wee one.) To recap Will Ferrell as the titular blue meanie with the giant light-bulb noggin is forever trying to off Brad Pitts Metro Man the square-jawed guardian of Metro City. Two aliens shot to earth from distant destroyed plants theirs is a lifelong back-and-forth-and-back-again--Lex Luthor and Superman oughta sue; so too Lois Lane recast as newshound Roxanne Ritchi (and voiced by Tina Fey as Liz Lemon). But early in the film Megamind offs (but not really) Metro Man (if Brad Pitt spent more than 19 minutes in the recording studio hes a terrible manager of his time) at which point Megamind takes control of the town and realizes--no--that evil without good to kick around is wasted. So off he goes to pick a new fight with Tighten (Jonah Hill natch) a superpower even more narcissistic than he which leads--no--to further disaster at which point its Megamind to the rescue. The boy asked me halfway through ""Is this supposed to be funny?"" Dunno I said. ""Because its not"" he said. Nor any fun either. If nothing else I found my sons Kryptonite boring superhero rip-offs voiced by check-cashing actors. At least Steve Carell used an accent.

Though enlivened by some moderately clever twists on the superhero-movie template ""Megamind"" never shakes off a feeling of been-there-spoofed-that. Its hard to stay fresh in such over-mined territory and this latest DreamWorks toon while not without its moments of wit and emotion comes off as a derivative wisecracking machine rather than a feat of sustained imagination. For all the references to classic comicbook fare the film ""Megamind"" most immediately recalls is ""Despicable Me"" and while Paramounts massive promotion should command family audiences in similar numbers some may feel disinclined to pony up so soon for yet another misunderstood uber-villain. With his oversized noggin and shiny cerulean complexion the evildoer in question looks like a mad scientist crossed with a radioactive Smurf or perhaps a less lugubrious version of ""Watchmens"" Dr. Manhattan by way of ""The Flintstones"" Great Gazoo. And like Steve Carells Gru in ""Despicable Me"" Will Ferrells Megamind is bald and speaks with an unusual accent; commands a small army of mechanized servants; almost never succeeds in pulling off his harebrained schemes; and is so temperamentally benign so devoid of any hint of real menace that the films exploring-the-dark-side conceit feels toothless from the get-go. Its not easy being blue and in a chucklesome prologue Megamind explains his extraterrestrial origins his early years spent honing his wicked ways in a maximum-security prison and his longtime rivalry with Metro Man (voiced by Brad Pitt) the white-caped savior beloved by the denizens of Metro City. Star TV reporter Roxanne Ritchi (Tina Fey) is the Lois Lane in this ""Superman""-styled universe covering Metro Mans heroic feats while fending off the gauche advances of her cameraman Hal (Jonah Hill). These early scenes are dominated by a considerable degree of winking know-it-all humor granting the fast-talking characters an annoyingly blase attitude about all the comicbook-movie tropes theyre riffing on; one soon begins to wonder if scribes Alan Schoolcraft and Brent Simons intend to deliver an action-adventure worth its salt or just a smugly ironic pastiche. Things take a more inspired turn when in the first of many sizable setpieces Megamind unexpectedly succeeds in eliminating Metro Man and brings the city to its knees. But just as the Joker needs Batman so Megamind realizes victory is pointless without an arch-nemesis to keep him on his toes and he and his resourceful piranha-robot sidekick Minion (David Cross) conspire to cook up a new superhero. In a series of thoroughly but not unenjoyably contrived developments aided by an elegant arsenal of gadgets and some deftly timed slapstick Megamind finds himself falling for Roxanne while Hal becomes his singularly unpromising choice of opponent. Soon the films moral universe is spinning giddily out of whack; indeed the sharpest element of ""Megamind"" is its elastic sense of the genres traditional good-vs.-evil binaries -- a gambit that would have been even more successful if the film were not conceived along the lines of a kid-friendly mass entertainment and its titular villain were allowed to be as dastardly as advertised. But viewer relatability and redemptive character arcs must come first and Ferrells high-pitched vocal delivery makes this fey eccentric blue-skinned green-eyed monster engaging enough if not exactly cuddly and gives the unlikely bad-guy-gets-the-girl subplot the requisite emotional heft. Other vocal turns are bright and serviceable although the dialogue isnt sharp enough to allow anyone in particular to stand out. Smarter and less cloying than ""Despicable Me"" (if not nearly as rich as Pixars ""The Incredibles"") ""Megamind"" marks an advance in thematic and technical sophistication for ""Madagascar"" director Tom McGrath. Yet the film remains beholden to the DreamWorks credo of nonstop jokey humor in service of a desperate bid for pop-culture relevance stuffed with obvious musical choices (like Michael Jacksons ""Bad"") bizarre throwaway references to other movies (like ""The Karate Kid"") and attempts to channel the slang of its presumed target audience (one character threatens to ""go all gangster"" on another) always playing to the viewer rather than inhabiting a fully imagined story. As with most CG animation the use of 3D while not essential reps a reliably agreeable enhancement lending the technically polished production a nice depth and texture especially in crowd scenes. Apart from a few futuristic flourishes the citys architecture feels classically metropolitan with skyscrapers that allow for the sort of vertiginous wrecking-ball setpieces that recall the likes of ""Spider-Man"" and ""King Kong."" Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfes score offers a pleasing corrective to the overamped pop soundtrack.

Daily Edition Login to download Todd McCarthys Film Review Megamind 908 PM PDT 10/31/2010 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS An early holiday-season animated 3D winner. TWITTER The second big animated feature of the year after Despicable Me to center on an arch-villain who sees the error of his ways Megamind is snappy good fun. Fast-paced but not frantic goofily good-natured and attractively designed for widescreen 3D this splashy new effort from Tom McGrath who made the Madagascar hits happily avoids the crassness and relentless showbiz referencing that have marred some past DreamWorks Animation entries. With its nifty concept and high-octane cast this Paramount release looks to rake in strong returns with general audiences through years end and it would be a shock not to see a sequel down the line. Almost in the manner of an old farce Megamind is loaded with role reversals of main characters suddenly switching personalities or being revealed as having been someone else in disguise. ""I was born to be a super-villain"" the blue-headed pointy-chinned title character reflects on a life that began on an outlying planet from where in a sort of double-Superman move two toddlers were rocketed to Earth one fortuitously landing in a mansion the other ending up behind bars. Little life-highlight snippets reveal that from childhood to increasingly rivalrous adulthood the ever-plotting Megamind has always been bested in his nefarious plots by the effortless superiority of Metro Man a magnanimous if self-satisfied caped superhero. Adored by the one and all and with nothing left to prove Metro Man (a perfectly preening Brad Pitt) is no sooner honored with the enormous Metro Man Museum than Megamind (Will Ferrell enthusiastic and well-spoken) manages to turn the tables on him at last. Caught in the middle is TV newscaster Roxanne (vibrant Tina Fey) a sexy babe whose shapely contours and assertive personality strongly recall the female lead voiced by Reese Witherspoon in Monsters vs. Aliens. Startlingly Metro Man appears to be history but when Megamind finally achieves his dream come true -- unbridled power over Metro City -- he doesnt know what to do with it because he no longer has an arch-rival. So via a dose of Metro Mans DNA he endeavors to create one out of Roxannes hapless overweight cameraman Hal (a suitably snide Jonah Hill) who quickly goes over to the dark side to avenge the countless slights hes received throughout his life. This leaves Megamind no choice Hell have to become a good guy to fight the massive destruction Hal in his evil new guise as carrot-topped Titan has begun to unleash on the metropolis a battle eventually and unsurprisingly joined by a dormant ally. Megamind arrives at a time when the whole superhero genre is beginning to feel a bit tapped out but the fun McGrath and his clever writers Alan J. Schoolcraft and Brent Simons take in their dextrous plotting is sufficiently contagious to overcome the familiarity. The effervescent characters and frequent role-changing (even the warden at the prison to which Megamind returns is not immune to identity shifts) guarantee theres never a dull moment and McGrath takes good care that the action doesnt cross the line from the energetic to the simply exhausting. Not only this but the director goes the extra mile with the films visual aspects notably -- and perhaps especially -- with the 3D. Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid to the dimensional work here is that after a certain point you tend to forget that youre watching a 3D movie so gracefully are the perspectives integrated into the compositions and movements. Wearing the glasses still darkens the image by at least 25% but the images burst out nonetheless and there is particularly adroit use of an invisible car the outline of which just barely registers when it figures in the action. Overall the film stands as one of the best arguments in favor of 3D among the many examples that have surfaced over the past couple of years in that it feels like mature restrained even natural use of the technique. The self-appointed exponents of super-status (both good and bad) carry with them mild whiffs of The Incredibles which is hardly a bad thing. This is perhaps especially true of the newly minted Titan who suggests a less childish version of the nasty prankster Syndrome in his relish for trip-wiring virtue and goodness. The very way in which the story is weighted -- toward bad guys who have their reasons -- represents a tacit acknowledgment that in such fare evil is always more interesting than good. In the matter of tone the filmmakers apply a light touch that reshuffles familiar archetypes in a way that is respectful but not craven jokey but not arch. The soundtrack is a busy one with the original score by Lorne Balfe and Hans Zimmer constantly dovetailing with a raft of familiar pop songs smartly used. Special attention has even been taken with the end credits which are conceptually reminiscent of the brilliant street sign and graffiti creations on West Side Story but also take advantage of the 3D format to dramatic effect.
