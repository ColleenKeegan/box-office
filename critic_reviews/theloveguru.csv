Well they obviously havent seen The Love Guru an overgrown dirt-patch of clunking juvenilia from the sick mind of writer/star Mike Myers which sees the once-heralded Canadian funnyman now frantically scrabbling at the piss/shit/snot-flecked depths of the low-brow comedy slop bucket. Supposedly a bawdy satire about societys dependence on spiritual gurus who spout quick-fix answers and acronym-heavy mantra it feels more like Myers has been in a state of cryogenesis since finishing the last Austin Powers movie and has chosen to produce an outmoded 70s-style sex comedy where chastity belt and erection jokes are still considered hard comic currency. Myerss central performance as the hirsute heavily spangled Guru Pitka is woefully misjudged exposing his limited breadth as a comic performer as each lewd sub-schoolyard gag sinks quicker than a limbless pack mule in an ocean of sludge.

"The Love Guru (PG-13)  | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Movies The Love Guru (PG-13)  Theres nothing to love about Mike Meyers. In this image released by Paramount Pictures Jessica Alba left Mike Myers center and Manu Narayan star in the comedy ""The Love Guru."" Share Print Save to your profile By Connie Ogle Miami Herald When did it happen this moment at which Mike Myers morphed from Minor Annoyance Who Used to Be Funny to Officially Unbearable Bore? Was it on the third journey to the Shrek well or the fourth? The first Austin Powers sequel or the were-barely-even-trying-here Goldmember? Or -- most likely -- did he get lost somewhere in the smug smarmy chaos of Cat in the Hat a film as charming and delightful as a hairball in your morning coffee? Its hard to pinpoint exactly when Myers went off the rails but the unappetizing The LoveGuru proves hes still coasting on his SNL/Waynes World/Austin Powers credentials. He spends almost every moment of screen time desperately mugging for the camera while making a series of scatological jokes that arent funny. Films can be creatively gross and hilarious -- see Superbad or Borat -- but The Love Gurus gags are merely embarrassing. And the Myers accent bit Indian this time stopped being amusing sometime after the birth of Fat Bastard. The story centers on Guru Pitka (Myers) a self-help expert who has millions of adoring fans many of whom are Hollywood stars just so that Myers can trot out a few cameos to pass the time. He greets his followers with a hearty Mariska Hargitay You dont have to be psychic to know where that joke is going. Still despite his success Pitka feels like a failure because hes not as famous as Deepak Chopra. To best Chopra hes got to get on Oprah and to do that he must accept a commission from the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba. No. Im not joking). In an even more unlikely turn of events the Leafs are heading for the Stanley Cup Finals. Yes. Those Leafs. Pigs fly; its chilly in hell. But the Leafs chances are in doubt because star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Marco) rocked by a breakup with his wife Prudence (Meagan Good) cant score anymore. Guru Pitka must find the source of Roanokes trauma and reconcile the couple. The problem Prudence has hooked up with rival goalie Jacques Le Coq Grande (Justin Timberlake) whose nickname echoes his impressive physical endowment. Timberlakes droopy mustache recipe for Quebec pizza and frantic dance moves are the most amusing elements of the movie but not even he can save it. Nor can Stephen Colbert as a hooked-on-hallucinogens hockey announcer a concept that probably sounded better than it turns out. Nothing can counteract the tired humor (say Myers getting smacked in the face with a urine-soaked mop or Ben Kingsley as a cross-eyed mentor). The musical numbers -- with one exception -- are meant to evoke Bollywood but merely plunking out 9 to 5 or Space Cowboy on a sitar isnt enough to rouse an audience. (For a comic musical number that works check out the spectacular finale of The 40-Year-Old Virgin or even any random episode of TVs Family Guy.) Hindu groups have protested the film demanding an apology for its depiction of issues related to their culture and religion. But the truth is everybody who pays to see this mess deserves a great big Im sorry. The Love Guru is insulting to anyone with a healthy sense of humor and the simple desire to laugh.

That doesnt happen in The Love Guru. As the Guru Pitka a cheeseball ersatz-Indian mystic in oversize love beads who teaches his celebrity clients how to renounce their egos (even as he personally craves the nirvana of being asked onto Oprah) Myers is trying for another of his endearingly hormonal imp-egomaniacs but hidden behind a wavy beard a wax-curled mustache and an astoundingly ugly squashed fake nose hes a little too grotesque. He plays this flyweight charlatan with a Groucho-lite corrupt patter but without the requisite touch of innocence. The whole characterization is tacky and far too secondhand. Pitka in essence is the Maharishi dragged into the age of Deepak Chopra and Myers doesnt bring much to him beyond a lispy one-note accent (singsong Indian dialect veddy funny no? Actually...no) his usual beaming leer and a penchant for lines like ""Im so hungry I could eat a skunks bottom"" As a Caucasian orphan who studied at an Indian ashram with a blind guru (Ben Kingsley clowning far more merrily than Myers) Pitka was forced to wear a chastity belt and he still wears one. The movies equivalent of ""Schwing"" is the slightly depressing ""Clonk"" of Pitka getting excited within his metal pelvic prison. But who wants to see a satire of a holy mans lasciviousness in which the heros business remains under lock and key? The me-so-horny jokes in The Love Guru are limp imitations of the ones in the Austin Powers movies -- theyre basically Myers doing ""Take my crotch please"" And the movie perhaps as a result tends to fixate on even lower bodily functions. Pitka performs a few songs on the sitar (""Nine to Five"" ""More Than This"") and he doles out words of wisdom in the form of dirty anagrams but if youre in the mood for a delightful tweak of todays self-actualizing New Age gurus and their be-here-now snake oil look elsewhere. If on the other hand you want to see gags about boogers elephant poop and mano-a-mano duels with mops drenched in urine then this is the movie for you. The plot incidentally is a lifeless ordeal in which Pitka gets hired by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba pin-up bland) to spiritually enlighten her failing star player (Romany Malco) whose wife has been sleeping with a well-endowed rival. Did I mention that the rival is played in a 70s mustache by Justin Timberlake? Or that hes a Celine Dion fan? Okay you can laugh now.

Its not only fresh and unassuming but a film that serves very nicely the severely underserved audience of young girls. ENLARGE Abigail Breslin who won an Oscar nomination for her performance in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" plays the title role a 10-year-old who bless her heart and her Royal portable typewriter is determined to become a newspaper reporter. The story is set in Cincinnati in 1934 during the Depression when electronic journalism wasnt much of an option; no one but the radio commentator H.V. Kaltenborn wanted to be H.V. Kaltenborn. Kits father played by Chris ODonnell is a car dealer and her mother (Julia Ormond) is a lady of some leisure serving lunch in the backyard for members of her garden club most of whom wear floral prints. All of that changes though when Dads dealership goes bust and he leaves town in search of a job and Mom turns the family home into a boarding house for a collection of picturesque -- insistently picturesque -- characters. They include Joan Cusacks Miss Bond a mobile librarian who keeps bumping into things with her library truck and Stanley Tuccis Jefferson J. Berk a self-enchanted magician who levitates Miss Bond. This is the first theatrical feature film based on the American Girl line of dolls and the American Girl books. (Patricia Rozema directed Ann Peacock adapted Valerie Tripps book and David Boyd did the lovely cinematography.) As a piece of Americana its more Norman Rockwell than Dorothea Lange. The Depression has been cleansed of its most depressing aspects. Even a hobo jungle looks like a place where honesty and kindness trump bad luck. As a piece of filmmaking its less levitated than planted on uneven ground. For all its imperfections though ""Kit Kittredge"" looks awfully good when measured against the cynical slops being shoveled to mass audiences this summer. The film does deal with poverty in its earnest fashion and Kit is a worthy proto-feminist role model. She becomes a detective when justice requires it -- hobos have been blamed unfairly for a crime wave -- and breaks into public print despite the deep doubts of Wallace Shawns charmingly crusty Mr. Gibson an editor who makes his free-lancers earn their penny per word. All of this works as pleasantly as it does because the star carries the event-stuffed story with unflagging grace. Two years ago as Olive in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" Abigail Breslin was chubby wide-eyed and endearing. Earlier this year a tawdry studio comedy called ""Definitely Maybe"" turned her into a lip-glossed pre-teen who learns about her fathers romantic entanglements. In ""Kit Kittredge"" shes neither chubby nor sexualized but a comely young actress playing a smart pretty girl. Whats unchanged from ""Little Miss Sunshine"" is her sweet radiance. She seems delighted by life. ENLARGE A scene from My Winnipeg IFC Films My Winnipeg Until now Guy Maddins films have been an acquired taste I couldnt manage to acquire. Theyre surreal eccentric poetic and graphically striking in their intentionally crude soft-focus evocation of the silent era and the agitprop form. But ""My Winnipeg"" breaks through to something else. This autobiographical meditation is seductively funny as well as deliciously strange and hauntingly beautiful as well as stream-of-consciousness cockeyed. And the film succeeds partly thanks to rather than in spite of its swirling mostly black-and-white images that might have been downloaded from a fevered dream. Winnipeg is where Mr. Maddin has lived his whole life. In the films dream logic its the city and the life he must explore before being able to escape. ""What if I film my way out of here?"" he asks in a faux-naif voice-over. ""Its time for extreme measures."" To that end he uses actors to re-enact scenes from his childhood -- the acting is implacably bad but mysteriously affecting -- and home movies and snapshots that may or may not be authentic. The filmmaker dwells obsessively almost deliriously on Winnipegs twin distinctions the snow and the cold. (Snow falls on the actor playing him even when hes nodding off in a seat on a train.) His narration is as witty in its mock-epic way as the late-night free-form radio broadcasts that Jean Shepherd used to do many decades ago at KYW in Philadelphia. Yet the incantatory words play second fiddle to the moving pictures -- of Winnipegs vast fogbound train yards moldering arena and silhouetted sleepwalkers who carry the keys to all their old addresses as they like Guy Maddin search the city for fugitive memories. ""My Winnipeg"" is not your standard multiplex flick -- a childhood Chihuahua is played by a pug for Petes sake -- but given the prevailing standard thats all to the good. ENLARGE Steve Carell in Get Smart Warner Bros. Pictures Get Smart Rather than the laugh a minute promised by old comedies ""Get Smart"" generates approximately one laugh per hour and I cant remember either one. True to the TV series that spawned it the production looks cheerfully tacky but all other traces of cheer let alone sophistication have been expunged. Steve Carell in the role created by Don Adams is the bumbling agent Maxwell Smart and Anne Hathaway is in for Barbara Feldon as Agent 99. Never mind that hes 20 years her senior an age difference that extinguishes hints of romance. Her performance is shrill and he looks rueful when he isnt downright glum. (See a clip from the film.) ENLARGE Mike Myers in The Love Guru Paramount Pictures The Love Guru Compared to ""The Love Guru"" ""Get Smart"" is ""Citizen Kane."" Mike Myers as a blissed-out self-help charlatan named Guru Pitka gets to ride a bejeweled elephant and an electric carpet and talk with a funny Indian accent. But his character and a ramshackle plot about a lovelorn hockey star (played by Romany Malco) are only crude pretexts for crotch humor toilet humor sexual outuendo and a merciless succession of scenes involving flatulence urination and a dislikable dwarf. This from Paramount the studio of Cecil B. DeMille W.C. Fields ""Sunset Boulevard"" ""Rear Window"" ""Psycho"" and the road pictures of Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. The road taken by ""The Love Guru"" could hardly be lower and leads nowhere. ENLARGE Photofest DVD Tip This isnt a pick but a plea to Universal Studios. Please oh please release ""King of the Hill"" on DVD. Not the TV series which is widely available but the 1993 film directed by Steven Soderbergh with Jesse Bradford as a resourceful boy left to his resources in Depression-era St. Louis. Its one of the best coming-of-age films ever made.

"The Love Guru Comedy of salvation and slap shots | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsThe Love Guru Comedy of salvation and slap shots Watching Mike Myers The Love Guru is akin to being locked with a clergyman and a clown in a flaming car hurtling over a cliff.Mike Myers (as Guru Pitka) performs a minor miracle Making the Toronto Maple Leafs and integral part of The Love Guru  (PHOTO ILLUSTRATION BY BRETT LODGE / TORONTO STAR) | Order this photo  By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. June 20 2008 The Love Guru (out of 4)Starring Mike Myers Jessica Alba Romany Malco Justin Timberlake and Verne Troyer. Written by Mike Myers and Graham Gordy. Directed by Marco Schnabel. 87 minutes. At major theatres. 14A Watching Mike Myers The Love Guru is akin to being locked with a clergyman and a clown in a flaming car hurtling over a cliff.A collision of the sacred and the profane this made-in-Toronto comedy of salvation and slap shots leaves you marvelling at its spiritualism while also wondering if Myers will ever tire of phallus and flatulence gags. He really ought to call himself the High Priest of Silliness.For his first major screen performance since the disastrous The Cat in the Hat in 2003 Myers unveils Guru Pitka an American-born East Indian mystic character he claims to have been working on for more than a decade - even before he took Austin Powers to shagalicious heights.Pitka is drawn from the Scarborough natives genuine devotion to Eastern spiritual values which he shares with his friend and mentor Deepak Chopra a genuine guru who humours his protege with a cameo and subplot rivalry involving Oprah show appearances.Devotion doesnt equal solemnity in Myers holy book. His Pitka plays ""9 to 5"" and ""The Joker"" on his sitar lives in an ashram surrounded by nubile wenches and delights in making rude noises and starting bar fights. He is far too broad a character to be taken as a slap against any one organized religion.Pitka follows the teachings of a cross-eyed superior named Guru Tugginmypudha (Ben Kingsley) but he has trademarked wisdoms of his own to impart.Check out the acronyms of these pithy Pitkaisms Basic Information Before Leaving Earth and Be Loving amp; Open With My Emotions. This is a movie in a hurry to get nowhere - or ""Now Here"" as Pitka would put it.The first of many penis gags and the films main premise (""If we can fix Darren we can win the Cup"") spill before the opening credits and its all downhill from there - or uphill depending on whether you see the whoopee cushion as half-inflated or half-empty.The Darren in question is Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) a star Toronto Maple Leafs player whose marital mojo with wife Prudence (Meagan Good) has been stolen by his dastardly hockey rival Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake). Roanokes subsequent funk endangers the Leafs chance of winning the Stanley Cup (insert hollow laughter here) much to the chagrin of coach Punch Cherkov (Verne Troyer Mini-Me of Austin Powers). Leafs owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) tries to pull a rabbit out of a hat by summoning a guru on a carpet and thus Pitka is called to get the choke out of Roanoke.Thats as much plot as Myers and his new co-writer Graham Gordy sketched out on their cocktail napkin which doesnt give first-time director Marco Schnabel much to work with.The secondary characters are minor foils to Myers especially love interest Alba who disappears for vast stretches.Most of the films 90-minute running time is outrageously padded out with an endless series of infantile gags (including dwarf tossing and elephant humping) and jokes so old they have beards longer than Pitkas.Yet there are also occasional flashes of genuine insight and wisdom which is Myers avowed intent.The Love Guru will either appal you or tickle your funny bone until you yelp for divine mercy.The latter response is likely only if you have seen and enjoyed most of Myers other movies especially the two Waynes Worlds and three Austin Powers.(I went gaga for the guru when he explained why he has two tattoos.)Myers Pitka is the stealthiest of holy rollers he makes you roar just when you think hes going to hell in a hand basket.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    22degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

For a disaster look no further than ""Get Smart"" which is competing against ""The Love Guru"" in this weekends box office sweepstakes. Myers at least knows how to make a comedy He provides about 15 jokes before the opening credits even run. OK so eight of them arent funny but seven are and those seven are more than can be found in all of ""Get Smart"" - all 110 long labored agonizing minutes of it. But Myers real competition is with himself and his new movie alas is no ""Austin Powers."" Its awkward. The new character a popular self-help guru named Pitka is indistinct and not inherently funny. And this time out Myers overdoes the potty and penis jokes There are whole sections when watching the movie is like being locked in the mind of a 10-year-old boy. Yet the worst of Myers is related to the best of Myers Hes a high-wire act. In any given minute of ""The Love Guru"" he risks embarrassment and humiliation. The least self-protective comic imaginable he puts it all out there with every broad smile every role of the eyes and every goofy joke. Theres no net. He falls he gets up and throws out more jokes more smiles more physical effort. Along the way he embraces tastelessness - too hard - in ways that will sometimes make audiences sit back and think ""I cant believe he did that."" But even when these surprising moments arent exactly funny theyre not lazy. Theyre energetic. This is by the way what makes Myers better than Adam Sandler. Sandler is mostly about self-protection. His stupid jokes are casual deflections to keep the audience from getting too close. Myers stupid jokes are not deflections and theyre not casual. Theyre self-exposures with a neurotic edge. Myers compulsively opens himself up to ridicule and then waits to see if hes survived. Thats why even in a so-so movie like this one hes fascinating (and disconcerting) to watch. His latest incarnation is as an American raised in India who is the second-most-popular self-help guru behind Deepak Chopra. As an expert in love he is hired by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) to intercede in the love life of her star player (Romany Malco) because his wife (Meagan Good) has taken up with another man. The other man a goalie for the opposing team is known as Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande just to give you an idea of the kind of humor were dealing with here. Hes played with abandoned glee by Justin Timberlake. The action of the movie involves the Love Gurus devising strategies for the hockey player to win back his wife. Some of the bits are funnier than others but the basic character of the Love Guru himself has significant weaknesses as a comic creation. That he exists in a world in which Chopra also exists blunts the satire; it prevents Myers from mocking the concept of pop gurus in general. Like Austin Powers the Love Guru thinks hes funny when hes not but unlike Austin Powers the people around the Love Guru also think hes funny. So the people onscreen are laughing when the audience is not. Its also a mystery why a supposed wise man or someone who wants to be perceived as a wise man would be going around relentlessly making potty jokes pee-pee jokes poopy jokes and stinky jokes. The Love Guru remains a comic vehicle a construct who never takes on the dimensions of a fleshed-out character. Still Myers never quits and thats the great virtue of ""The Love Guru."" He throws in a mock Bollywood sequence (prominently featuring Alba who finally seems relaxed on camera). He brings out elephants. He plays the sitar. He has a really funny scene in which the gurus early training is depicted by digitally grafting his head onto a childs body. When Myers is funny hes funny.

"Love Guru The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; love-guru-the ) Love Guru The (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli To some Mike Myers is Wayne. To others he is Austin Powers or the voice of Shrek. Its doubtful that he will be Guru Pitka to many. The Love Guru Myers latest film and his most recent live-action endeavor since The Cat in the Hat is as unmemorable as the title character. Although the film can boast clusters of clever and/or amusing material they are not sprinkled liberally enough to obscure how thin all other aspects of this production are. The Love Guru is a skit that starts out promising but loses momentum as it goes on and on and ona| Occasional bursts of comedy keep things from becoming unbearable but whenever Myers tries to get even a little serious or advance the ""plot"" the desire to take a nap becomes almost overpowering. Guru Pitka (Myers) is known variously as ""The Love Guru"" and the ""Second-Most Famous Guru after Deepak Chopra."" His ashram is visited by""notables"" like Jessica Simpson Val Kilmer and Mariska Hargitay (theres a fairly amusing joke there). However he chafes at playing second fiddle on the worlds stage to Chopra with whom he studied as a child under the tutelage of Guru Tugginmypudha (Ben Kingsley). The Promised Land for Pitka is a guest spot on Oprah. His services are sought by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) when her star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) is unable to get the job done on the doorstep of the Stanley Cup Finals. Without Darren the Maple Leafs have no chance and he is unable to get over losing his girlfriend Prudence (Meagan Good) to the L.A. Kings goaltender Jacques Le Coq Grande (Justin Timberlake). Guru Pitkas assignment which comes with a 2 million paycheck and the sought-after appearance on Oprah is to reunite Darren and Prudence. On a broad level The Love Guru is as much a satire of Eastern-based self-help philosophies as Austin Powers was of spy movies. The movie is at its best during a seminar given by Guru Pitka during the early going. Using silly and sometimes profane acronyms (B.L.O.W.M.E.) the guru preaches a lifestyle perspective that distills to one simple premise D.R.A.M.A. During this lecture Myers gets in his jabs early and often and had the rest of the movie continued on this level The Love Guru might have been Myers most successful comedy to-date. Unfortunately it devolves into little more than a series of bodily fluid-themed gags and sex jokes. We learn for example why Tugginmypudha is cross-eyed why Jacques is nicknamed Le Coq and what happens when Pitkas chastity belt is put to the test. The problem isnt that this material is sophomoric but that its sophomoric and frequently unfunny. When was the last time an elementary school graduate laughed at a man making ""diarrhea noises"" for about 30 seconds? Myers has fashioned a career out of hiding behind inventive caricatures with faces and accents not entirely his own. Theyre easy enough to list Austin Powers Dr. Evil Fat Bastard Shrek The Cat in the Hat. Guru Pitka with his long beard and flowing locks is another such entity. Hindu groups are protesting the movie but Myers isnt mocking the religion as much as the commercial offshoots that have rooted in pop culture over the past few years. The movie never addresses or lampoons issues of spirituality. Pitkas goal in life is to achieve self-love. (Only then can he have sex with Jessica Alba.) His is a secular mantra. The closest The Love Guru comes to commenting on Indian culture is when it parodies cheesy Bollywood musical numbers. Myers gets in more jabs at Canada than India. (He is of course Canadian.) The participation of Vern Troyer (playing the Maple Leafs coach not Mini-Me) allows Myers to unleash a barrage of dwarf-related jokes many of which are of questionable taste and a few of which are very funny. I wanted to like The Love Guru more than I did. The frustrating thing about the movie is that it contains moment of comedy that verge on inspired but they are too infrequent to justify the running length. For the most part the film meanders trying to get us to care about paper-thin characters like Roanoke Prudence and Jane. With Austin Powers Myers went after a subject that everyone recognized as being ripe for satire. While his subject material in The Love Guru is no less easily lampooned the parody has less universal resonance. That more than anything else may be what limits interest in this movie. The nature of this comedy isnt that different from that of the popular Austin Powers series but the material isnt as accessible.

To borrow word-shtick from the guru Pitka its AWFUL as in ""Anyone Watching Feels Um Loser-ish.""Pitka is the latest creation of Mike Myers and yes he was great on ""SNL"" 1992s ""Waynes World"" movie was fun and the first two ""Austin Powers"" films had great bits especially 1999s ""The Spy Who Shagged Me."" ""Guru"" however is simply unwatchable.Myers cutesy habit of eyeing the camera conspiratorially letting us know hes aware of how stupid he looks now seems uncomfortably needy. Hes like a kid in a school pageant too awful to turn away from but then hell smirk and you see its an act -- though whether the awfulness or the confident smirk is the act is unclear.In ""The Love Guru"" nothing anchors the charade. Pitka an American raised in India by a cross-eyed swami (Ben Kingsley) strives to be ""the next Deepak Chopra."" He gets his chance when the sexy owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) asks Pitka to help her star player  after his wife falls for a rival goalie (Justin Timberlake with a ridiculous accent).The plot is paper-thin and yet laborious Pitka has run-ins with the Maple Leafs diminutive coach (Verne ""Mini-Me"" Troyer) celebrity cameos abound and Pitkas mantra-sounding greeting of ""Mariska Hargitay"" is suddenly said to ... the real Mariska Hargitay Who couldve guessedSuch obvious moments are mixed with the oh-so-tedious ""bad joke-worse joke"" structure in which a deliberately dumb riff is followed by silence as people onscreen look uncomfortable. So a dumber riff follows then more silence -- and the audience is left not laughing at all. Along with crotch jokes hockey pucks to the head and ""wacky"" sports announcers (Stephen Colbert and Jim Gaffigan) its deja vu all over again Wasnt some of this in ""Major League""?Myers -- who wrote the script with Graham Gordy -- is stuck in time throughout ""The Love Guru."" Its title could belong to a 1960s Don Knotts farce while Myers voice sounds like Bakshi the Indian buffoon Peter Sellers played in 1968s ""The Party."" Guru Pitka feels  like a mid-90s sketch character in search of a movie. Timberlakes Rico Suave villain seems like hes from a different equally annoying skit.Aside from voicing Shrek Myers hasnt given a lead performance since 2003s stinker ""The Cat in the Hat."" Before that was the one-joke ""Austin Powers in Goldmember."" If the clock stopped -- and. watching this it feels like it does -- ""The Love Guru"" would beat them both as the least funny comedy of the decade so far. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

He needs someone with a fat red pen to scratch out a few of his worst bad habits. Just look at The Love Guru an uneven and hysterically bizarre comedy about an ambitious potty-mouthed mystic who helps a Canadian hockey star get his wife and his groove back. Directed by newcomer Marco Schnabel (from a screenplay by Myers and Graham Gordy with inspiration from Deepak Chopra) the film reminded me of lesser Peter Sellers vehicles (The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu) in which a genius for meticulous comic masquerade crashes on a weakness for overstatement. The obvious can be amusing once or twice but by the fourth or eighth go its time to bring on the draconian edits. For starters poo. I dont know about you but I can only take so much fecal-related humor in a single film. Fear-loosened bowels? Elephant dung? Prolonged diarrhea sounds produced with a coffee mug? Fine but please allow my normally ironclad stomach to recover between scenes before hitting me with another round of sniff-the-finger. Im not even including the male-anatomy jokes onanism jokes a crushed-lychee routine and scenes in which spiritual disciples wield large urine-soaked mops during instruction. All right that part with the mops was funny. Sort of. And Stephen Colbert killed me as a drug-addicted sportscaster. But the best bits by far in The Love Guru are its beautifully droll send-ups of the semi-Eastern self-help biz and the needy celebrity culture that supports it. When the Guru Pitka (Myers) speaks in his cavernous Los Angeles ashram he turns to a large mustard-yellow screen filled with self-actualizing buzzwords. ""Intimacy"" is ""Into-Me-I-See""; ""Nowhere"" is ""Now Here""; ""Guru"" breaks down into ""Gee You Are You."" The gist of his message ""If you cant love yourself you cant love another."" Groundbreaking stuff. Afterward he greets admirers with his signature blessing ""Mariska Hargitay"" a cute touch that demands a certain cameo. But Pitka with his bulbous prosthetic nose and Salvador Dali mustache seems to have hit the glass ceiling for holy-man superstardom. What does Chopra have that he doesnt? The answer an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. The solution Accept an offer from the Toronto Maple Leafs owner (Jessica Alba? Really? Since when?) to fix the marriage attitude and scoring power of its top player (Romany Malco). Only then will Oprah have him on her show. Only then will Pitka feel successful. It seems Pitka has a few kinks of his own to work out on the path to enlightenment. He also has a large clanging chastity belt to contend with just imagine those jokes. Providing more opportunity for locker-room humor (and facial hair) is Justin Timberlake as rival hockey player Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande a highly strange and creatively accented performance that pushes the envelope on J.T.s acting career. I am not sure what to make of Ben Kingsley as Pitkas cross-eyed mentor who appears in flashback at the small Indian village where the guru-to-be is an orphan named Maurice. In a weird but curiously effective move Myers head is superimposed on the body of a kid; the result bears an eerie resemblance to Alfred E. Neuman. Hindus have protested Myers buffoonish spin on their ancient religion and it is I have to say rife with stereotyping. But the target is less Hinduism (the word never pops up) than the saffron-colored accouterments of the faith and its watered-down transference to the self-help industry. Advocates for little people might have cause to gripe at the films many ""midget"" jokes all of them lodged at Verne Troyer -- Mini Me from Myers AustinPowers oeuvre -- as the Maple Leafs abrasive coach. One is questionable. Two is too much.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Guru Pitka delivers his words of wisdom via fanciful wordplay and self-help- book titles like ""If Youre Happy and You Know It Think Again."" So many of the American-born India-reared ""neo-Eastern self-help"" teachers sayings come our way sharing one or two will hardly spoil the middling ""The Love Guru."" A Pitka favorite plays on the word ""intimacy"" ""into-me-I-see."" See? Mike Myers return to live action after three animated features is no ""Shrek."" Nor is it the offensive dreck one might have feared. After all for months film critics and others have been receiving e-mail from American Hindu leader Rajan Zed demanding a number of conciliatory gestures from Paramount the studio releasing the film. Last Saturdays e-mail asked that the MPAA change the movies PG-13 rating to an NC-17. All of this of course has been a campaign waged on a film unseen. It turns out to be (as is so often the case) a lot of drama for a slight comedy that has a few sweet laughs and plenty of naughty gags (Pitkas development arrested around 13 years old). For all its bright costumes sitar-inflected ditties and occasional Bollywood frippery ""The Love Guru"" is staid going. The setup is at once boilerplate and personal. Myers known for his love of hockey came up with the personage of Pitka after his father died and he sought spiritual counsel. And ""The Love Guru"" is more a teasing riff on that quest than a full-on dig at Indias predominant religion. Toronto Maple Leafs star Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco of ""Weeds"") has come undone. First he left wife Prudence (Meagan Good). Discovering why makes for spiritual misadventure and sets up a showdown between Pitka and Darrens mother (Telma Hopkins). Prudence in turn hooks up with Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande a French Canadian goalie on the L.A. Kings. Headed into the Stanley Cup showdown Roanoke -- the Tiger Woods of the ice -- has become Roan-choke. Jessica Alba plays Jane Bullard the unfairly despised owner of the Maple Leafs who hires Pitka to reunite Roanoke with his beloved. As Le Coq whose emblem is a rooster Justin Timberlake wears a thin moustache and a belly tat that reads ""The Man"" and ""The Legend"" with directional arrows. If theres offense to be taken here it should be on behalf of Myers co-stars who often function as no more than foils for his schtick. (""Shrek"" remains fun because Myers is one part of a talented voice ensemble not the ham at the center of the Easter dinner.) Manu Nayaran plays Rajneesh a Tonto sidekick to Pitkas Lone Ranger on an Elephant. And Ben Kingsley is Guru Tugginmypuddah young Pitkas spiritual teacher. His other student is some earnest kid named Deepak Chopra. The childish gag on names is less about ethnicity than snarky silliness. Myers competition for this weekends box office Steve Carell in ""Get Smart"" did a similar routine on ""Saturday Night Live."" Verne Troyer ""Mini Me"" in the Austin Powers sequels plays Maple Leafs coach Punch Cherkov (I know I know) a tough guy who sees right through Pitka. Though isnt it past time to retire the angry dwarf role for a spell? In countering a stereotype of little people it has become its own cliche. Theres always a chance that I dont get the well of British comedy history Myers draws from though ""The Love Guru"" feels less Peter Sellers circa ""The Party"" than it does Benny Hill. In a more transcendent comedy the movies moral about self-love might have hit the sweet spot between wise and wise-cracking. Instead when Pitka ends his bite-size lessons with ""TM"" we should understand its not meditation but branding hes after.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor June 21 2008 Save for later Saved Mike Myers who stars as a second-tier Deepak Chopra in ""The Love Guru"" is a real chameleon of a comic and yet no matter how many disguises or outlandish outfits or facial prosthetics he fits into he remains himself. Or should I say ""himself."" For all I know Myers in real life is a monkish recluse but his screen persona is indubitably in-your-face.It doesnt matter whether hes playing Austin Powers or the cohost of ""Waynes World"" or the German talk-show host Dieter or the Barbra Streisand-worshiper Linda Richman on ""Coffee Talk."" It doesnt even matter if hes impersonating Mick Jagger. What links all these characters is Myerss gift for antic elfin burlesque. Hes like a second-best Peter Sellers.This is not to say that Myerss comedies are all equally funny. Even at his best he can be overbearing beyond the point of parody. Its no accident that Myers was at his most effective in his ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches where the tight formats reined in his sloppier excesses. In his feature films the hilarious moments are essentially sketches too. There are enough such moments in ""The Love Guru"" to make it if not an unadulterated pleasure then at least a guilty one. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Myers plays Guru Pitka who as a child was left by his American parents at the gates of an Indian ashram presided over by the high and mighty - and cross-eyed - Guru Tugginmypuddha (Ben Kingsley doing his best yet again to make us forget he once played Gandhi). Pitkas best friend and rival in the ashram was Deepak Chopra. Wanna bet Chopra makes a guest appearance in ""The Love Guru""? (He may not realize hes being lampooned. On the other hand as a great swami once uttered publicity is publicity.) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review The Love Guru Bearded and with a bulbous schnoz Myerss resplendently robed Pitka looks like a cross between a peacock and the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He could have stepped right out of the cover of the ""Sergeant Pepper"" album. Ensconced in America with a celebrity clientele Pitka churns out a steady stream of self-help guides with titles like ""I Know You Are but What Am I?""Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team asks him to intervene when the wife of her top player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) runs off with the star goalie of the rival L.A. Kings Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake). In Pitkas fevered noggin reuniting husband and wife will not only restore the disconsolate Darrens scoring ability but more important land him a spot on ""Oprah.""Most of the supporting cast members are lackluster which only makes Myerss yogic shenanigans stand out even more. (An exception Stephen Colbert playing a demented Stanley Cup sports announcer.) Whether hes plucking a sitar or romping in a Bollywood fantasia or gliding across the ice in his motorized carpet Pitka is ecstatically enthralled with himself. Myers captures the con artist in this celebrity guru but he also locates his inner child - or to be more exact his inner brat.On some level Myers buys into all the touchy-feely stuff that Pitka is proffering which ultimately makes ""The Love Guru"" mushier than it needed to be. But be thankful for small favors At least he didnt haul out Barbra Streisand for a cameo appearance. Grade B (Rated PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout language some comic violence and drug references.)

Comments The Love Guru With its scatological humor penis jokes feeble puns and middle-school ideal of love this Mike Myers vehicle exemplifies American comedys continuing slide into infantilism. His skill at characterizations enables him to pull off some scabrously funny moments as Guru Pitka an Indian self-help icon whos offered 2 million to heal the lovesick star of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Romany Malco) after the hockey players wife takes up with his Quebec rival Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake). The ersatz Indian motif leads to Bollywood parodies and elephant-dung sight gags but the movie scores better with its jabs at the fatuous narcissism of self-help. Jay Roach protege Marco Schnabel directed; with Jessica Alba and Verne Troyer. PG-13 86 min.

"Theres little to love in Myerss Guru - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review Theres little to love in Myerss Guru Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Wesley Morris Globe Staff / June 20 2008 Some movies are polite enough to save their outtakes for the closing credits. Others wait for the DVD release. ""The Love Guru"" doesnt have that kind of patience. Its a pitiful assortment of bad ideas and gags that never work; I dont know what else to call a movie that asks us to find Jessica Alba credible not only as the owner of the beleaguered Toronto Maple Leafs and a comedian but as a woman attracted to a vulgar hirsute Mike Myers. Oh yes I do Embarrassing.Alba continues her tragic imperviousness to comedy failing to deliver the merest syllables (""you"" ""and"" ""me"" for instance) with conviction. But focusing on her limitations is unfair since the movie is essentially a vehicle for Myerss indulgences as an entertainer and his iniquities as an egotist. This is the first time weve seen Myers in the flesh since he committed assault and battery on Dr. Seuss and I wish the cat had stayed in the hat.Myers brings us another tale of male mojos lost and found. This one concerns a Toronto Maple Leafs player (Romany Malco) whose game has gone south since his wife (a misused Meagan Good) left him for the Los Angeles Kings lascivious heavily endowed goalie (Justin Timberlake). Alba and the Maples Leafs coach (Verne Troyer) turn to Myerss title superstar spiritualist Guru Pitka a Westerner raised by a cross-eyed Indian wise man (Ben Kingsley sending up himself as Gandhi).Should the dubiously accented Pitka (he sounds like every Mike Myers character ever created) reunite the athlete with his lady and the Leafs win the Stanley Cup Oprah Winfrey will declare him ""the next Deepak Chopra."" Cue humping elephants testicular sight gags would-be cheeky unprintable anagrams and would-be cheekier malapropisms.If you can see comedy gold in those hills you probably work at Paramount the studio thats spamming movie theaters with this junk. The joke-to-laugh ratio is woeful. From scene to scene you get the sense that Myers who wrote the movie with Graham Gordy (Marco Schnabel directed it) might be trying to work something out. But his process here is always more scatological than artistic. With a changeling like Peter Sellers the whooshing you heard even on a bad film was that of man racing concepts. On ""The Love Guru"" the same sound is more of a flushing nature. In the first two ""Austin Powers"" movies Myers had some inspired Sellers moments and the movies were after something - James Bond and 1960s London.Whats the joke this time? Things are so bad here that the few good ideas seem brilliant. Pitkas mantra for instance is ""Mariska Hargitay"" and in childhood flashbacks Myerss freckled face is digitally superimposed on a childs body. But when you see Alba and Myers cheesing it up in a Bollywood-style duet complete with fake print scratches and happy nonsense lyrics (""lugubrious recalcitrance"") you glimpse the movie this really should have been.In the early scenes it looked as though ""The Love Guru"" might be assailing Hollywoods attraction to cults and spiritual outfits. After one of Pitkas shows Val Kilmer and Jessica Simpson show up backstage. But the movie isnt going for C-list satire. Later it looks like it might be playing racial games. Timberlakes French-Canadian has a bigger penis than his black rival (the movie does nothing with Malcos being a star in the NHL).Its all just an excuse for Timberlake to stuff his Speedo (now hes bringing sexy front) and go gaga over - wait for it - Celine Dion. (Hes terrible but in a self-mocking YouTube-stunt sort of way.) For his part Malco who was last seen as Tina Feys doorman in ""Baby Mama"" isnt entrusted to do much. And no opportunity to humiliate Troyer who was Myerss tiny ""Austin Powers"" sidekick is passed up.Right now Adam Sandler is up to similar tricks in ""You Dont Mess With the Zohan"" and hes getting away with them. That movie fearlessly concocts an entertaining brew of vulgarity and sweetness out of sexuality race and unfashionably bad taste. Its just as cruddy-looking as ""The Love Guru"" - the popularity of homemade viral videos (which crested a year ago) having allowed moviemakers to lower their formal standards or employ none at all - but ""Zohan"" gets a charge out of the culture its plugged into. ""The Love Guru"" is plugged into trends that died 10 years ago and it cant make its idiosyncrasies work in its favor the way ""Zohan"" does. Theyre charmless.

""The Love Guru"" wont be so indelible. As Pitka Americas No. 2 Near-Eastern Self-Help Expert he is not quite a one-joke character and the film itself is a shapeless rag bag of gags. Its zany but too aimless to leave a lasting impression. Pitka an American child raised in an ashram alongside his boyhood rival Deepak Chopra is a perennial also-ran in the enlightenment racket. He has a spirituality superstore in the Hollywood hills with his name in neon but without an appearance on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" hell never top Chopras fame. The solution comes in the form of a poorly integrated plot tangent The owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba) offers Pitka 2 million to treat the teams star (Romany Malco). The player cant score following a breakup with his wife. Not only will it be a tidy payday explains Pitkas avaricious manager (""The Daily Shows"" John Oliver) its guaranteed to get him on ""Oprah."" If comedy is talked about in terms of delivery Myers is in a league of his own. No other film star reaches out to the audience with such a stockpile of winks leers eye-rolls and double-takes. In Myers comic universe the fourth wall is a window shade that can be snapped open for a second and pulled shut again in a flash. THE LOVE GURU  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating PG-13 for crude and sexual content throughout language some comic violence and drug references. But no amount of mugging can salvage a collection of scattershot jokes clothes-pinned to such a slender plot. Its one thing to parody a cowboy or a detective or a spy but is there a cultural consensus on whats funny about Third World spiritualists? Emoting full force in a rajahs beard and wildly embroidered costumes Myers never creates a distinctive identity. Justin Timberlake hiding behind a porn star mustache and an ear-bruising Quebecois accent makes a stronger impression as Malcos hockey adversary and romantic rival. In place of a clearly defined central character the film offers us a barrage of bits that feels more relentless than inspired. Some hit home. Verne (Mini-Me) Troyer plays the Maple Leafs hot-tempered hockey coach and a meeting in his private office triggers a half dozen uproarious visual gags. There are some good-humored spoofs of Bollywood musicals that raise a smile. But too many other jokes rely on the limited comic possibilities of elephant dung sixth-grade sexual innuendo and celebrity cameos. The appearance of a cross-eyed Indian guru isnt inherently funny except that its Ben (""Gandhi"") Kingsley playing the part. As they might say back at the ashram this is a sari excuse for a comedy.

By Dana Stevens To listen to Slates Spoiler Special about The Love Guru click the arrow button on the player You can also click here to download the MP3 file or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed in iTunes by clicking here. Jessica Alba and Mike Myers in The Love Guru There are good movies. There are bad movies. There are movies so bad theyre good (though strangely not the reverse). And once in a while there is a movie so bad that it takes you to a place beyond good and evil and abandons you there shivering and alone. Watching The Love Guru (Paramount Pictures) is a spiritual experience of a sort but not the sort that its creator and star Mike Myers intended. This tale of a guru who brings joy to all who meet him is the most joy-draining 88 minutes Ive ever spent outside a hospital waiting room. In the course of those long minutes Myers leads you on a journey deep inside himself to the source from whence his comedy springs--and its about as much fun as a tour of someones large intestine. Myers has long specialized in characters who are victims of arrested development from Austin Powers emerging from his 30-year deep-freeze to the fully grown Wayne Campbell broadcasting his cable-access show from his parents basement to Simon the child who does ""drawerings"" in his bathtub while admonishing the audience ""Dont look at my bum"" As the host of the MTV Movie Awards earlier this month Myers did a whole sketch that revolved around the ability of his character an animal wrangler to distinguish different species by eating their poop. But in The Love Guru Myers isnt just mining the comic potential of regression Hes regressing on-screen before our very eyes. Advertisement Guru Pitka is a Canadian-born Indian-raised spiritual master who lives on a glitzy L.A. ashram and writes self-help books with titles like If It Hurts When You Do That Stop Doing That and I Know You Are But What Am I?. When he isnt resenting Deepak Chopras fame or covering Dolly Parton songs on the sitar Pitka gives mumbo-jumbo PowerPoint lectures to celebrities like Val Kilmer Mariska Hargitay and Chopra himself all of whom appear in stiff cameos. Pitkas lifelong dream is to appear on Oprah a goal that his agent (The Daily Shows John Oliver) swears is within his grasp if he can just help out Darren Roanoke (the chronically underemployed Romany Malco) the star hockey player for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Darrens game hasnt been the same since his wife (Meagan Good) left him for his superendowed Quebecois rival Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake in a perm and a codpiece). So Pitka coaches Darren in the discipline of self-love (unlike nearly every line in this film thats not meant as a dirty joke) while falling for the teams beautiful yet supremely boring owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba). However puerile the Austin Powers movies became the character himself remained an inspired creation built from the ground up out of an internally consistent set of traits (lechery dandyism and a firm belief in his own fabulousness). But Guru Pitka makes no sense--one minute hes a cretinous dolt whos never seen a corn dog before the next hes delivering double entendres with a clever wink. He swings between vainglory and ravenous insecurity in a way that seems uncomfortably autobiographical. Mostly though Pitka is a leering boor whom the other characters treat mystifyingly as a guileless charmer. I soon lost count of the number of scenes in which someone--usually the hapless Alba--chuckled indulgently at Pitkas lewd patter while the movie audience sat in painful silence. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Its difficult to get across just how unfunny the jokes in The Love Guru are. Theres one gag (""Whats the capital of Thailand?"") that I remember from a party in junior high school--I didnt laugh then either. Some of the lowest moments involve Sir Ben Kingsley who appears as Pitkas mentor the permanently cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha. Ive read that Kingsley who was made a knight of the realm in 2001 often alienates the English press by insisting on the usage of his full title even in casual social situations. If hes that concerned about maintaining his dignity he might reconsider taking on roles in which people swordfight with mops soaked in their own piss. Myers has been absent from the screen (except for his voice work in the last two Shrek movies) since 2003. The Love Guru grew out of what hes described as a period of introspection in his own life following his divorce and his fathers death. Its also entirely his baby Myers hired a first-time director Marco Schnabel; co-wrote the screenplay; and shepherded the project from beginning to end. Though the sketch-based comedy that Myers rode to box-office glory has been supplanted of late by the more realistic Apatow style Myers characters can make you laugh--as this weeks ""best of Mike Myers"" tribute on NBC was no doubt meant to remind us. But The Love Guru is proof that sometimes external constraints and collaboration can serve a performer better than unchecked artistic freedom. Consider the uncomfortably prescient sight gag near the beginning of the film that illustrates Guru Pitkas yogic flexibility--he can even get his head up his own ass.

The Indo American religious leader has a point. When Myers Guru Pitka bows in salutation his Hindi-like greeting goes ""mariska hargitay."" Among his best-selling spiritual tomes If Youre Happy and You Know It Think Again and the self-esteem manual Stop Hitting Yourself Stop Hitting Yourself Why Are You Still Hitting Yourself? And in a flashback to Pitkas boyhood the pimply lad can be seen genuflecting at the (crossed) feet of Guru Tugginmypuddha - a cross-eyed sage played with a phony Indian accent by Ben Kingsley winner of an Oscar for Gandhi. But the folks who should really take offense at the unwaveringly juvenile comedy of The Love Guru are just about any and every human male. Myers merrily stupid send-up of Eastern enlightenment belongs in the Guinness Book of World Records as the movie with the most penis jokes in the history of Hollywood. It starts with Justin Timberlakes character - a Quebecois hockey star by the name of Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande - and continues with Kingsleys yogi bequeathing the teenage Pitka a chastity belt. Thats just the um tip of the phallic hilarity. In reality The Love Guru isnt likely to offend anyone - save perhaps audiences that prefer their comedy sophisticated not sophomoric and devoid of references to bodily functions. Like Myers Austin Powers spy spoofs The Love Guru piles dumb gag upon dumb gag - its like benign pummeling. Occasionally you just have to laugh. In the case of The Love Guru very occasionally. Pitka is an American left on the steps of an ashram in India when he was a child who now doles out words of wisdom from his lavish Los Angeles perch - an ashram outfitted in grand Bollywood style replete with a VIP room. Pitka second only to Deepak Chopra in the guru biz is hired by Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs to get the teams star player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) back in the game. Since Roanoke discovered his wife with the L.A. Kings legendarily endowed goalie Monsieur Grande hes been unable to play. The Stanley Cup championship is here and if Pitka can restore Roanokes game - and marriage - hell get a fat check and a guest spot on Oprah too. The Love Guru comes complete with musical numbers copulating elephants Comedy Central employees (Stephen Colbert John Oliver) and cameos from Val Kilmer Jessica Simpson and yes Deepak Chopra. Myers wearing a bulbous prosthetic nose and fake beard does his blissful yogi shtick and Alba is impossibly cute as the NHL franchise owner and Pitka love interest. Diminutive Verne Troyer the Mini-Me of Austin Powers reteams with Myers to play the Maple Leafs manager. Hes the butt of many a little-person joke having to endure cracks about gnomes and the Lollipop Guild. But even he doesnt seem especially offended. The Love Guru  (out of four stars) Directed by Marco Schnabel. With Mike Myers Jessica Alba Justin Timberlake Romany Malco and Ben Kingsley. Distributed by Paramount Pictures.

George Kraychyk/Paramount Pictures hide caption toggle caption George Kraychyk/Paramount Pictures Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba) works out her love problems through Bollywood-style dances. George Kraychyk/Paramount Pictures Austin Powers and Shrek have nothing to worry about -- but unsuspecting audiences sure do. Which is to say that The Love Gurus chastity-belt wearing inane-mantra-spouting Guru Pitka -- Mike Myers latest (allegedly) comic creation -- is going to steal neither fan attention nor the stars availability from his other franchises. Those suckered into seeing this relentless exercise in juvenilia meanwhile may well recoil from sports comedies Bollywood musicals self-help spiritualists puns and even characters with beards for the foreseeable future. Or from ever wanting to see Myers again in any context. Its hard to imagine who the comedian thought the target audience might be for a slapsticky self-help/ice-hockey/ elephant-poo comedy. Its rated PG-13 but its essentially unsuitable for even mildly discerning viewers of any age. The Love Guru is about how Pitka the worlds No. 2 Near Eastern spiritualist -- after Deepak Chopra who foolishly agreed to a cameo -- follows his bliss from an ashram to the locker room of the Toronto Maple Leafs. Their star players wife is being shtupped you see by competitor Jacques Le Coq Grande played gamely by Justin Timberlake in a padded codpiece (wheres the Zohan when you need him?) and thats putting Torontos finest off his game. So the teams owner (a hapless Jessica Alba) has hired Pitka to help salvage the squads Stanley Cup prospects. The gurus methods involve penis jokes lewd self-help shtick elephant erotica and effluvia and an endless stream of single-entendres -- all given the bums rush by first-time director Marco Schnabel without the slightest sense of timing or comic flair. Myers who co-wrote and co-produced -- effectively meaning no one could say nay no matter how lame his ideas -- has imported Verne ""Mini-Me"" Troyer from the Austin Powers movies to be subjected to hobbit jokes and other short shtick. Stephen Colbert provokes exactly one smile in his five minutes of screen time as a drug-addicted hockey announcer but Brits Ben Kingsley and John Oliver are entirely upstaged by their character names as cross-eyed Guru Tugginmypudha (sound it out) and agent Dick Pants. None of them -- not one not for a moment -- is remotely funny.

They neednt have worried. Oh the movie is plenty offensive - on comedy grounds on filmmaking grounds on good-taste grounds on pretty much any grounds youve got. But on religious grounds? Not so much. If that makes it sound as if The Love Guru is a bad movie its not. Its a terrible movie. Its a vanity project gone nuts perhaps the most-egregious case of ego run amok since John Travolta subjected the world to Battlefield Earth. Is there no one at Paramount Pictures who could just tell Myers no? Certainly not first-time director Marco Schnabel. Shall we blame the writers then? Oh wait Myers co-wrote the film too. Myers plays Guru Pitka an American raised by Indian gurus. He comes back to America and cracks the self-help racket conducting acronym-heavy seminars while repeating the mantra ""Mariska Hargitay."" Yes that Mariska Hargitay. And yes she has a cameo. Whatever. Alas Pitka is merely the second-most-popular self-help guru going. The only way he can equal or surpass childhood friend Deepak Chopra he figures is with an appearance on Oprah. And the way to score that gig is by helping hockey player Darren Roanoke (Romany Malco) conquer his mommy issues and get back together with his wife (Meagan Good) in time to help the Toronto Maple Leafs win the Stanley Cup. Roanokes wife meanwhile is seeing Jacques Grande (Justin Timberlake) a goalie known for his endowment. Yes. Well spare you his nickname. Pitka meanwhile has designs on the team owner Jane Bullard (Jessica Alba); the attraction is obviously mutual. The only problem the chastity belt Pitka has worn since childhood and cant remove until he learns to love himself. If you want to know the level of comedy were dealing with consider that Ben Kingsleys character - and you have to wonder how he got roped into this - is named Guru Tugginmypudha. Say it out loud and its a laugh riot Or not. How bad do things get? Two words elephant sex. Yep. Let that roll around in the ol noggin for a little while. Please dont mistake this as the rant of an officer in the morality police. Crude humor is fine - as long as its funny. Penis jokes are fine - as long as theyre funny. Its difficult to imagine a context in which elephant sex might work outside a nature documentary but hey were open-minded - as long as its funny. Laughs forgive a lot. Just ask Judd Apatow. But when the funniest line in the movie is an outtake from Verne Troyer youve got problems. Only Timberlake seems to get the absurdity of it all and he just goes with it working a Celine Dion fixation through a ridiculous French accent. There are some amusing cameos the most inspired being a callback to a controversial moment during a Hurricane Katrina benefit concert. And Stephen Colbert is funny at least for a while as a druggie hockey announcer. But Myers is like a comedy vacuum sucking all the laughs out of the movie. To say he plays Pitka broad is an understatement. His constant mugging which was endearing in the Austin Powers films is a sand-in-the-pants irritant here. The Love Guru wont quite make you pine for the days of the live-action Cat in the Hat but it will make you believe that the fourth Shrek cant get here fast enough.

""The Love Guru"" is so relentlessly juvenile as to merit a new twist on the PG-13 rating -- one that strongly cautions not only those under 13 but anyone much above it too. Even so producer/co-writer/star Mike Myers partially wears down resistance by simply pummeling the audience with bathroom jokes sixth-grade puns and silly songs and clocking in under 90 minutes the movie avoids this summers comedic mini-trend of overstaying its welcome. Opening opposite ""Get Smart"" isnt ideal but coupled with lingering affection for the ""Austin Powers"" series this might just be dumb enough to at least hold its own. Myers developed the character of Guru Pitka via a sort-of workshop process of New York stage appearances and for the most part this spoof of self-help spiritualism feels like a ""Saturday Night Live"" bit fluffed and stretched to theatrical length. Many of the jokes bring to mind Three Stooges-type farce (Ben Kingsleys master guru is named -- now sound this out -- Tugginmypudha) including a seemingly endless array of self-improvement acronyms like Be Loving amp; Open With My Emotions -- all trademarked of course. Although a renowned guru Pitka suffers from an inferiority complex regarding his childhood pal Deepak Chopra and yearns to equal Chopras level of fame by winning an appearance on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show."" (Make what you will of the fact that while Chopra makes a cameo appearance the pic has to settle for ""Oprah"" footage and a Winfrey voice impersonator.) Pitkas potential ticket to fame comes from the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs Jane (Jessica Alba) who is struggling with a star player (Romany Malco) emotionally wounded by a bad marital rift. Hoping to salvage the teams chances of winning the Stanley Cup Finals she retains Pitka to cure the case of the yips the players developed -- brought about seemingly by his wifes rebound relationship with the enormously endowed Jacques ""Le Coq"" Grande (Justin Timberlake). The porous plot actually is all secondary to the shtick and working completely unfettered by first-time director Marco Schnabel Myers cheerfully unleashes a steady barrage of hit-and-mostly-miss gags that range from Bollywood numbers (pretty funny) to repeated use of ""Mariska Hargitay"" (yes the name of the ""Law amp; Order"" star) as a felicitous greeting to elephant erotica (not that funny for anybody whos ever been to the zoo). With ""Powers "" Mini-Me Verne Troyer as the Leafs hockey coach theres also a near-limitless supply of runt elf and Hobbit jokes. Beyond Myers pic pretty much squanders its supporting cast -- though Timberlake does steal a few moments with his awful Canadian accent -- which includes Comedy Centrals Stephen Colbert as a drug-addled announcer and ""The Daily Shows"" John Oliver as Pitkas agent. As for Alba she has even less to do here if thats possible than in ""Good Luck Chuck"" which might warrant some further thought about playing the object of desire in screwball comedies. Rambunctiousness by itself is hardly a virtue but Myers so unabashedly embraces the lowest rungs of comedic DNA that whether one succumbs to it or not at least theres no time to be wasted arguing about subtext. Sitting through ""The Love Guru"" doesnt provide any grand insights about self-actualization but if watching someone get sloshed with urine sounds like a knee-slapper then Mike Myers is determined to make movies for you.
