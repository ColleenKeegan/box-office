"The Core is a joyous movie about Armageddon. Slate Sign In Sign Up The Core is a joyous movie about Armageddon. The Core is a joyous movie about Armageddon. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.March 28 2003 205 PM Faster Faster Deeper Deeper The Core is a joyous movie about the Earth exploding. By David Edelstein The Cores catharsis disaster never felt so good In The Core (Paramount) a space shuttle on its return trip to Earth goes horrifyingly off course and plummets toward a major metropolis. One of the countrys most beloved landmarks melts killing hundreds and half the city beyond it gets leveled by fire. In another part of the world destruction rains down on a 2000-year-old archeological wonder. Ultimately scientists must sacrifice their lives one by one to keep the world turning. You would think given the events of the last few months and our sense of impending catastrophe that watching The Core would be traumatic depressing maddening. I think its the feel-good movie of the year. Advertisement It buoyed me not because its especially well-done (its OK--it could be a lot worse) but for the same reason that the Japanese liked watching Godzilla incinerate large sections of their island while the radioactive dust of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was still settling as therapy. Heres the scariest stuff in the world organized according to the age-old rules of melodrama complete with cartoony special effects. Heres a chance to empathize not just with the guy who has the bad fortune to be on the bridge as it collapses (i.e. the guy that most of us would be) but with the genius scientists and stalwart astronauts who pilot their super vessel (here a giant phallic drill made of something called ""unobtainium"" and nicknamed ""Virgil"") into Mother Earth. In the great tradition of Armageddon (1998) The Core spells out the American resolve in the face of disaster Drill That Bitch. The Core begins unnervingly eerily with a yuppie pitching for a 30 million account and then pitching forward face-down on a glass table. Some kind of electromagnetic pulse has stopped his heart--and the hearts of other people in the vicinity. Pigeons go nuts in Trafalgar Square. The space shuttle loses its bearings. Brilliant disheveled dreamboat professor Aaron Eckhart gets a weird hunch about all these electromagnetic mishaps then orders his graduate students to search the Internet for similar incidents and to plot some kind of model. To make them go faster he says ""Ill sign your doctorates blindfolded""--which should tell you whats at stake. He scans the data and murmurs to himself ""Be wrong. Be wrong."" Im sorry I just love this stuff. I love the convincing-the-military-that-the-world-is-about-to-end stuff and I love the assembling-the-eccentric-but-crack-team stuff even more. Eckhart momentarily sprung from the virulent universe of Neil LaBute makes a great sci-fi lead spitting out the gobbledygook like he knows what hes talking about and finding the right balance of arrogance and humility. Complimented on his bravery he says ""Lack of oxygen kept me from weeping like a little girl as is my custom in dangerous situations""--and he doesnt seem glib just honest. Tcheky Karyo my new favorite unshaven French actor (you can see him next week in The Good Thief Neil Jordans fun remake of Bob le Flambeur [1955]) plays an endearing French researcher called Sergei and Stanley Tucci is a hoot as a plummy-voiced prima donna celebrity-scientist who might have inadvertently caused the whole core mess in the first place. Will he remain a sniveling coward or rise to the occasion like a true American? As Tuccis sometime rival Delroy Lindo stops the show as the wild-eyed visionary who created unobtainium which turns mineral into liquid in milliseconds and thereby makes it feasible to rocket hundreds of miles through solid rock and drop nukes into the earths core. Pinocchio-nosed DJ Qualls is a teenage hacker brought in to keep Kaus Reynolds and other bloggers from getting wind of the planets imminent demise. Bruce Greenwood is the square-jawed shuttle commander and Hilary Swank is another astrbasg6fsdwtu. Lets try that again Hilary Swank is another astrobdhefydfqfleurrrr. I cant seem to type the last word. I can suspend my disbelief about the unobtainium the ship shaped like a giant drill the part about ""jump-starting the planet"" with a nuke--but not the part about Hilary Swank as an abanabastraut. Swank might have been so touching in Boys Dont Cry (1999) because she was playing the part of an overactor instead of merely overacting. Having never been more than 50 or so feet underground I cant say if the visual effects are realistic but the director Jon Amiel could have ordered up a few more beautiful and mysterious images; the floating globs and geodes on the Virgil screen look only a couple of cybergenerations better than the arcade game ""Asteroids."" Amiel did put some flair into designing the Hitchcockian pigeons-crash-Trafalgar sequence (although it goes on too long) but the lightning bolts over Rome would electrocute only cartoon people and the budget for leveling San Francisco appears to have gone south with that citys economy. But this is the rare disaster picture with a witty script (by Cooper Layne and John Rogers) and the members of the team that dont make it get ends that are worthy of them. They die so that we can continue to imagine our own deaths at movies like this. As I said The Core is no more than an OK disaster picture but I suspect that people will flock to it this weekend. It offers a way for us to wallow in our current anxieties without making other demands on ourselves that we march (for or against the war) that we learn a little history that we contemplate a new world disorder that cant be straightened out with lots of money and a big drill. The movie opens with the camera seeming to plunge into the mountain of the Paramount logo and thats about the most comforting place I can think of right now. David Edelstein is the chief film critic for New York magazine and a film critic for NPRs Fresh Air. Load Comments Powered by Livefyre Slate Sign In Sign Up Most Read 1.

Ironically the use of weapons of mass destruction (the movie even uses this phrase) will help save the world. Theres a reason for stockpiling them that the United Nations hadnt considered. The Core is reminiscent of Armageddon though its slightly more subtle. Because the special effects are not especially astounding the movies deepest impact lies in the performances Aaron Eckhart as a geophysics professor Hilary Swank as an unflappable astronaut Delroy Lindo as an outlaw inventor and Stanley Tucci as a Carl Sagan-like celeb scientist. Things start out ominously with several mysterious deaths and freakish phenomena such as an inexplicable crash of the space shuttle (Swank lands it in the dry Los Angeles riverbed and avoids injuries) the appearance of a Northern Lights-like effect in the sky and frenzied swarms of birds dropping to their deaths. Eckhart soon figures out what has happened The electromagnetic field deep within Earths core is falling apart. The core itself has stopped spinning and everyone will be cooked to death by microwave radiation. TV Review The Core (out of four) Assassination Tango (out of four) In dashing Indiana Jones style Eckhart gets to be a hero. He and his crew journey to the center of the Earth in a ship that conveniently Lindo has been constructing in the desert for 20 years. The project is top secret and oddly enough no one in the public seems to question why birds are falling from the sky or why Romes Colosseum has tumbled. Jules Verne this isnt but it makes for fairly diverting escapist fare. However there is something unsettling particularly during wartime about a movie that detonates nuclear weaponry even if used for good not evil. (PG-13 sci-fi life-death situations and brief strong language) --Claudia Puig Assassination Tango There isnt any kind of dance you can compare to Robert Duvalls latest as an actor/director though a slo-mo minuet might come close. Duvall is marginally interesting playing a New York hit man hired to take out a despotic retired Argentine general but as a filmmaker hes too in love with tango-hall photography (understandable) and extended chats (much less so). Stuck in a hotel when his targets arrival is delayed and irked that hes missing a favored childs birthday party Duvalls domesticated hood is attracted to a graceful long-limbed mover on the tango floor (Luciana Pedraza). But the actor was much more magnetic moving his own limbs during a few scenes in Randa Haines underrated 1993 Wrestling Ernest Hemingway a movie that took the time to put some life into its characters. Early on there are hints that Duvalls character might be intriguingly short-fused a kind of Joe Pesci/GoodFellas agitator without the obvious psychosis. But before long the movie stalls then stalls again over 114 minutes that feel twice that. Even Marlon Brando wouldnt be able to keep this from being the last tango in Buenos Aires that anyone is likely to see on screen for a while.

Qualls Richard Jenkins. Directed by Jon Amiel from a screenplay by Cooper Layne and John Rogers. 125 minutes. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi/death situations and brief strong language. Several theaters. If circumstances ever find me on a subterranean vessel hell-bent on boring into the center of the Earth I can only hope that Stanley Tucci will also be aboard. In ""The Core"" a bizarre tale of ""terranauts"" who must delve into the Earths core and detonate a nuclear device Tucci as a preening celebrity geophysicist (hey its a movie) almost singlehandedly makes the journey watchable. While everybody else aboard is scurrying around the vessel saying things like ""Its not going to work without oxygen"" and ""Hey guys were close to the mantle interface"" Tuccis character is busy dictating his memoirs suavely smoking in nonsmoking zones or skulking around raising his eyebrows at everyone. Its a wild scenery-chewing performance that has the feel of an actor taking matters into his own hands -- perhaps director Jon Amiel was too busy supervising the (admittedly impressive) effect of blowing up the Golden Gate Bridge to notice. Outside of Tuccis performance things progress in typical sci-fi/disaster-movie fashion. An odd phenomenon is noted -- namely that massive numbers of people worldwide are mysteriously dying always in very picturesque locations such as the Eiffel Tower or Trafalgar Square (where massive numbers of pigeons drop like flies as if its a steroid-fueled remake of ""The Birds""). A team must be assembled to save the world -- and Aaron Eckhart Hilary Swank and Delroy Lindo among others are up for the task. The special effects have mixed success; the subterranean spaceship looks from the outside like a time machine and from the inside like a motion-simulation theme-park ride with the entire trip resembling a journey through the inner ear. But ""The Core"" maintains a goofy likability mostly due to Tucci and a sweetly earnest performance by Swank as a young astronaut whose duties mostly consist of flipping switches and looking worried. Scientists may shudder but at least some good actors are getting work.

Starring Aaron Eckhart Hilary Swank Stanley Tucci and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Jon Amiel. (PG-13. 130 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There is something dead at the core of our world -- literally -- in the sci- fi fantasy ""The Core."" A weapon that cuts deep into the Earths surface has caused the molten metal at the planets center to stop revolving. As a result the electromagnetic shield that protects us from the sun is breaking down. Every living thing on Earth is doomed. If theres a metaphor at work in this picture -- the planet itself is recoiling in horror at the antics of modern humanity -- it doesnt feel heavy- handed. Like those 1950s sci-fi movies inspired by nuclear terror ""The Core"" seems unaware that its all about expressing an anxiety lurking beneath the surface. Its a straight-ahead adventure with the usual number of thrills but with the added virtue of being smarter and more sober than one might expect. As with most sci-fi disaster movies the beginning -- the little-do-they- know part -- is particularly fun to watch as it slowly dawns on people that something is wrong very very wrong. The first sign of electromagnetic meltdown comes when everybody with a pacemaker drops dead within a 10-block radius. The second sign comes when all the pigeons in Londons Trafalgar Square lose their navigational ability and start acting as if theyre in an Alfred Hitchcock movie -- smashing into windshields breaking panes of glass. Aaron Eckhart plays Josh a rumpled professor of geophysics who looks a lot like the rumpled professor Eckhart played in ""Possession."" Josh is the kind of unwashed genius who can look at disparate unexplained phenomena and figure it all out ""Everybody on Earth is dead in a year."" Say what? It gets worse In less than four months electromagnetic disruptions will cause cities to crumble with biblical abruptness. ""The Core"" is mainly about a journey to the center of the Earth a mission to detonate a huge nuclear blast to jolt the dormant metal back into motion. That the movie never feels cabin-bound has partly to do with smart pacing. Director Jon Amiel makes frequent cuts from a spaceship-like vessel to mission control and every so often lets us in on some new disaster thats happening on the surface. But mainly ""The Core"" works because the characters are idiosyncratic enough to seem authentic but not so zany that they seem contrived. Hilary Swank is Rebecca a chipper but driven co-pilot serving under a commander played by Bruce Greenwood with his usual humane gravity. Tcheky Karyo brings an expected joie de vivre to his role as a French weapons specialist and Delroy Lindo is a passionate inventor. In the flashy role of an egotistical geophysicist Stanley Tucci wisely doesnt let himself get carried away. He could have played it like Dr. Smith on ""Lost in Space"" but doesnt. The characters interact like strangers cooped up together who have been forced to forge a makeshift familiarity. The genuineness of their rapport goes a long way toward making what is essentially a science fantasy come off like science fiction. The vessel flies downward slicing through solid rock with a sonic laser looking as though its going backward through the birth canal. For some reason it doesnt burn up. Something to do with liquid nitrogen. Outside the ship we see giant crystals and diamonds but mainly everything is various shades of yellow -- about as visually arresting as the inside of a childs kaleidoscope. The only special effects of real interest in ""The Core"" are in scenes taking place on the Earths surface. Anyone who has seen the trailer knows that one American city in particular bears the destructive brunt of the suns rays -- and surprisingly enough its a city known not for its sun but for its fog. And for its big orange bridge. As for the European Union kiss Romes Piazza Venezia goodbye. Its strange how in ""The Core"" natural disasters have a way of focusing on the best cities and on the famous landmarks within those cities. It doesnt take a geophysicist to figure out what this is really about. The only question is whether the movie is expressing the modern fear of terrorism or merely exploiting it? Lets be charitable and assume its doing both. . This film contains scenes of destruction.

The film is frequently hilarious -- occasionally but not often on purpose. For the most part it is monumentally dumb. The director Jon Amiel has made an old-fashioned disaster movie -- a combination of ""Fantastic Voyage"" and ""The Towering Inferno."" Apparently he feels a whole generation of moviegoers has been denied sub-mediocrities like these. ""The Core"" which opens nationwide today has the road-show corniness of a Cinerama picture -- its as if someone had decided to deliver the slow-motion oddness of an episode of ""Gumby"" to the big screen. The premise is simple if not simplistic ""The core of the Earth has stopped spinning"" says Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) a hunky geophysicist with the meticulously tousled head of an alternative pop star. ""Three months and were back in the Stone Age a year and were fried"" says the eminent scientist and braggart Dr. Zimsky (Stanley Tucci) who seems to be wearing Millard Fillmores hair. If the scientists in this movie devoted as much time to working in their fields as they spend getting their coiffures styled maybe the Earth wouldnt be in so much trouble. ""The Core"" falls soundly in the tradition of glamorous inconsistency that made 70s disaster pictures so much fun. Unlike say the 1998 ""Armageddon"" in which entire cities were slaughtered just to move the sleeping giant of a plot around most of the catastrophes here are as carefully engineered by Mr. Amiel and his crew as those episodes of ""The A-Team"" which started out soothing viewers with the announcement that no one had been hurt during the stunts. To begin with the Earths internal troubles lead to worldwide electrical storms caused by titanic eruptions of static-electrical discharge. In a rare exhibition of taste the film declines to show what this static would do to all of the worlds socks fresh out of their dryers. (This is not to say that the movie avoids bad taste entirely in one of the few scenes in which many perish because of catastrophic occurrences the Golden Gate Bridge collapses making it play into fears of terrorism.) And the Earths new discordant rhythms lead to wide-scale animal freakout in London a flock of pigeons dies but not before hurling their tiny carcasses on citizens and -- gasp -- American tourists. Things are so bad on Earth that no one at the Fox Network turns this phenomenon into an episode of ""When Animals Attack."" A mission to go the center of the Earth and get the core spinning again is quickly conceived ""The objective is simple -- the obstacles are gigantic"" says Keyes who has a habit of voicing ideas that have long since occurred to everyone in the theater except the people on screen. (In another instance people drop dead in Boston -- in midsentence -- and the government has to seek out Keyes. He surmises that their pacemakers have stopped -- a conclusion that even the sleeping infants in the audience will have come to.) Keyes assembles a crew that includes the reclusive scientist Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) who as it happens has invented a ship capable of penetrating the Earths mantle among other things. He has also created an impenetrable substance called inobtainium. The cast of ""The Core"" deserve Oscar nominations just for being able to speak most of the lines without succumbing to the chortles. On the planets surface the master hacker Rat (D. J. Qualls) is shanghaied into the mission and uses his skills to keep anyone else from doing what he has the ability to do -- hack the Internet and get information about this secret mission. He works with Stickley (Alfre Woodard) who heads mission control at the headquarters of this NASA-in-reverse. Hilary Swank -- forgive me the Academy Award-winner Hilary Swank -- plays Beck the ambitious co-pilot of the burrowing craft she calls the adventurers ""terranauts."" We meet her in a scene that will send a few shudders through the audience. She and her commander Colonel Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) are finishing a space-shuttle mission when something goes horribly wrong. Ms. Swank has to figure out new coordinates with seconds to spare and the ship is landed in the Los Angeles River basin. (The incident is later attributed to atmospheric disturbance though the real problem looks like extraordinary unlucky timing on the part of the filmmakers.) Sections of ""The Core"" drag so sullenly that the crews six-day mission seems to be taking place in real time. And the vaulting obviousness becomes so dreary that a real-life core shutdown seems like an act of mercy. There are a few -- though very few -- legitimate moments of fun like Keyess unease over the beautiful play of light in the sky a sign of the planets deterioration. And the actors seem to be enjoying themselves. Tcheky Karyo as a French nuclear scientist and weapons specialist who is also Keyess old friend gets a chance to rely on his abundant charm for once. Mr. Tucci has a hugely good time playing a variant of the ""Lost in Space"" preening coward Dr. Zachary Smith though this time he is styled as if he had stepped out of the pages of a 1992 issue of Esquire or the halls of William Morris. And some of the amusement is purely unintentional. As Keyes Mr. Eckhart is a good sport but he seems to have been cast because Stephen Boyd was unavailable and his inability to pronounce the word ""nuclear"" only adds to the movies awkwardness. The brazen silliness of ""The Core"" is becalming and inauthentic like taking a bath in nondairy coffee creamer. The Earth cores inability to turn is mirrored in the casts inability to give the picture any spin. ""The Core"" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language and explosions carnage and destruction so frequent they could come from a cable channel devoted to such displays. THE CORE Directed by Jon Amiel; written by Cooper Layne and John Rogers; director of photography John Lindley; edited by Terry Rawlings; music by Christopher Young; production designer Philip Harrison; produced by David Foster Mr. Layne and Sean Bailey; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time 135 minutes. This film is rated PG-13. WITH Aaron Eckhart (Josh Keyes) Hilary Swank (Beck) Delroy Lindo (Brazzelton) Stanley Tucci (Zimsky) D. J. Qualls (Rat) Richard Jenkins (General Purcell) Tcheky Karyo (Serge) Bruce Greenwood (Col. Richard Iverson) and Alfre Woodard (Stickley).

Qualls Tcheky Karyo Stanley Tucci Alfre Woodard; Director Jon Amiel; Author Sean Bailey Cooper Layne Mark Medoff John Rogers; Producer (group) Paramount Pictures; Release Date Wide 03/28/2003; Runtime (in minutes) 135; MPAA Rating PG-13 Posted March 26 2003 -- 1200 AM EST The kitsch of the disaster movie is its square-jawed tone of ""scientific"" anxiety. We may be watching an asteroid zip toward earth or lava flow down Main Street but the appeal of the preposterousness lies in thinking Gee this could maybe happen. But will anyone think that for even a popcorn minute of The Core? Early on a chain of sinister warnings (pigeons crash from the sky etc.) leads Aaron Eckhart as a sexy professor with unwashed hair to theorize the unthinkable The worlds molten core has stopped spinning The planet will be thrown into electromagnetic turmoil unless Eckhart along with a team of physicists and pilots journeys to the center of the earth and sets off a series of nukes to get that hot and gooey global center on its axis again. ""The Core"" which comes down to a bunch of gifted actors (Hilary Swank Bruce Greenwood Delroy Lindo) trying to out-earnest each other as they sit around a cockpit and cruise through digital magma feels like the sort of thing you might have caught on TV during a rainy Saturday afternoon in the late 60s. Its a schlockier ""Armageddon"" crossed with ""Fantastic Voyage"" minus the fun. Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr Top Stories J.K.

In the saving-the-world-from-imminent-destruction genre ""The Core"" takes its place as the anti-""Armageddon"" The daring rescue team must travel into the earth instead of away from it and more notably the picture projects a sardonically irreverent rather than pretentiously self-inflated view of its own importance. As disposable as the popcorn that will be widely consumed during its theatrical runs this lavishly produced drama about a molten threat to global survival is nonetheless more palatable than most pictures of its ilk due to its keen awareness of its own preposterousness a self-knowledge exuberantly expressed by a mostly live-wire cast. Its release postponed once already due to delays with the abundant special effects Paramount pic is hitting the market at a difficult moment when audiences may be too preoccupied with real-life imperilment to be much amused by make-believe cataclysms. B.O. will be hard-pressed to cover massive production and marketing costs. Watching a disaster movie isnt what it used to be; its too difficult to invent scenes of calamitous catastrophe that dont somehow produce the uneasy feeling that such things could actually happen. Early set-piece of a U.S. space shuttle going into fiery descent and then crash landing is an obvious example. But scenes of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Colosseum being obliterated along with much of the beautiful cities that contain them just dont provide the escape they once did. For the moment anyway this too-close-for-comfort factor presents new challenges to aspiring disaster pic makers. Since the format demands the central group of professionals assigned to save the planet from extinction be whittled down to one or two members by storys end key decision here was the adoption of a cheeky tone that stops short of becoming outright parody. First-time screenwriter Cooper Layne and co-scenarist John Rogers (a former stand-up comedian ""Cosby"" writer-producer and ""Rush Hour 2"" cowriter) dispense with laborious exposition by making the leading characters so brainy they have no need for lengthy explanations. Such an approach proves refreshing especially when delivered by such energized actors as Aaron Eckhart and Stanley Tucci playing rival scientists of polar temperaments. Eckharts Dr. Josh Keyes a dashingly disheveled geophysicist is called in by the government to assess why 32 people with pacemakers in Boston dropped dead simultaneously. Then in a startling homage to Hitchcocks ""The Birds"" thousands of pigeons in Londons Trafalgar Square go berserk crashing into pedestrians cars and windows. After the space shuttle puts down unexpectedly in the concrete bed of the Los Angeles River (passing perilously low over a packed Dodger Stadium) and the aurora borealis becomes a fixture over Washington D.C. Josh comes to the conclusion the end of the world is nigh. Seems the earths electromagnetic field is falling apart because the fast-spinning molten rock that surrounds the planets core has stopped moving. At the outside Josh informs U.S. military brass the world has a year left a view seconded by preening scientist Conrad Zimsky (Tucci) whose high regard for himself knows no bounds. As in ""Armageddon"" the solution lies in nuking the phenomenon that threatens Earth in this case to restimulate the globes ""engine"" a task entrusted to Gallic atomic weapons wizard Serge Leveque (Tcheky Karyo) in what now plays as a nostalgic expression of Franco-American geopolitical collaboration. Conveniently enough Conrad knows a renegade scientist ""Braz"" Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) whos been working on a mighty machine that can cut through the hardest of materials and also withstand temperatures of up to 9000 degrees -- just the thing for burrowing to the Earths core. And who better to drive this craft than the pilots who gave the shuttle such a hair-raising ride Commander Robert Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) and Major Rebecca ""Beck"" Childs (Hilary Swank). A final member of the team is eccentric computer hacker genius Rat (D.J. Qualls of ""Road Trip""). By genre standards this set-up which lasts 55 minutes is adroitly and sometimes amusingly handled as Josh dubs himself ""Apocalypse Boy"" and the film is able to make light of how the ""terranauts"" will put ""the worlds biggest weapons of mass destruction"" to good use. Ultimately though director Jon Amiel and the vast special effects crew are faced with the unavoidable dilemma of how to visualize inner space while a giant manned drill bores its way through a few thousand miles of rock and whatever else they decide is down there. In the name of realism they cant go the way of Jules Verne and the makers of the 1959 screen version of his ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" by creating a subterranean world of spectacular caverns and swirling oceans populated by monsters. Instead the craft descends some 29000 feet to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean before reaching the earths crust then slices through all manner of gunk conveniently illuminated by the powerful laser that treats everything like butter except for some giant quartz and diamond fields. Plausibility issues begin to fester as the drama takes an unavoidably serious turn; no matter how glib the screenwriters its hard to explain away a characters ability to leave the ship when its been established the air pressure outside is 800000 pounds per square inch. Yet the characters do dwindle in number usually going nobly and furthering the task at hand. But when it comes time for the arrogant Conrad to sacrifice himself he throws a hilarious hissy fit that would do Sandra Bernhard proud; Tucci makes the egomaniacs outburst more scorching than any lava eruption the film has to offer -- and his characters insistence upon smoking even in the bowels of the earth as if he were in some World War II movie adds to the impudent fun. Still the speed bumps thrown in the way of the missions successful completion feel increasingly manufactured and as in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" little time is wasted getting the survivors back to the surface. Coda has a nicely subversive quality that would have paid off better had the script more clearly laid out what the official cover story was for what ailed the planet. As usual with this sort of fare each character has one defining trait. Aside from Joshs breezy brilliance and Conrads imperiousness theres Becks unswerving self-confidence Commander Iversons time-refined sagacity Brazs wounded pride Serges blustery humanism and Rats newly channeled mischievousness. Resourceful thesps do everything they can within the proscribed limitations. Lensed principally in British Columbia but with location and second unit work done in Utah L.A. San Francisco D.C. London Rome Paris and Montreal pic has a full-bodied feel given extra texture by John Lindleys lustrous cinematography. Score by Christopher Young is far more supple and less bombastic than those normally plastered over films like this. Except for two or three shots that scream CGI effects are generally very good with special kudos to the Rising Sun Pictures shop for the shuttle crash sequence and to 3D Site for the ultra-credible London bird rampage.
