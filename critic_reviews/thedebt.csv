Brad Wheeler The Globe and Mail Published Friday Jul. 08 2016 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Jul. 08 2016 1200AM EDT Comments Print /License AA Directed by Barney Elliott Written by Barney Elliott Starring Stephen Dorff David Strathairn Brooke Langton Classification 14A Genre drama Year 2015 Country USA/Spain/Peru Language English In The Debt a taut scenic drama about the social upshot of high finance Stephen Dorff is a carpetbagging American financier preying on Peruvians for their long-held government bonds. He pays pennies on the dollar. The film well-meaning but contrived does the same. The intersecting plots from first-time writer-director Barney Elliott burn slow A mountain farmer refuses to sell his land; a nurse in Lima struggles to care for her ailing mother; and a money deal with roots that stretch back to Perus agrarian land reforms in 1969 is reaching a fast-approaching deadline. Laudable for its commentary on hedge-fund greed and a government unable to take care of its people the well-acted film loses points for story conveniences that rob the final scenes of the emotional weight otherwise earned. A promise made is a balance owing and The Debt fails to pay off.

Video Trailer The Debt A preview of the film. By LEVEL 33 ENTERTAINMENT on Publish Date June 2 2016. Photo by Level 33 Entertainment. Watch in Times Video >> embed Its that very intricacy however that helps drain the drama from this first well-intentioned feature by Barney Elliott an American who lives in Peru and clearly cares about its people. Connecting corporate greed and rural poverty he introduces us to Oliver (Stephen Dorff) a cocky American hedge-fund manager. Olivers job is to purchase debt in the form of bonds that the Peruvian government owes to struggling landowners -- a task being stymied by a hardheaded mountain farmer (Amiel Cayo) and a wily businessman (Carlos Bardem) with plans of his own.While Oliver is slowly brought face to face with the brutal consequences of his ambition Maria (the magnificent Elsa Olivero) a weary nurse desperately tries to secure treatment for her ailing mother. Around her social services crumble and her options become ever more shady; yet the character thanks to Ms. Oliveros gentle authenticity never seems merely the victim of trickle-down economic pain. Softly photographed by Bjorn Stale Bratberg who brings equal care to the films pristine Andean locations Marias placid exterior hides a resolve as steely as that of any financier.Slow and sincere ""The Debt"" bites off more plot than it can dramatically chew its characters -- especially the go-between played by the excellent Argentine actor Alberto Ammann -- diluted by political maneuvering. Still Mr. Elliott remains hopeful suggesting that good people might be driven to do bad things but that inherent decency can win out. Sometimes.

"Reel Brief Take some powerful trips with these films | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesReel Brief Take some powerful trips with these films Reviews of Eat That Question Frank Zappa in His Own Words Wiener-Dog The Debt and Last Cab to Darwin plus Everybody Wants SomeThe late Frank Zappa influential and outspoken rock/jazz musician and showman from the documentary Eat That Question Frank Zappa In His Own Words.  (handout)   Greta Gerwig with title hound from Wiener-Dog a dark comedy by Todd Solondz opening Friday at TIFF Bell Lightbox.  (Linda Callerus)  Stephen Dorff stars in The Debt a financial drama opening Friday in Toronto.  (Picasa)  Theres something uplifting in the tale of an aged cap driver played by Michael Caton and his bid for a medically assisted death in Last Cab to Darwin.  (Wendy McDougall)  Blake Jenner left and Austin Amelio in Everybody Wants Some  (Van Redin / The Associated Press)  By Peter HowellMovie Critic and Linda BarnardStaff Reporter and Bruce DeMaraEntertainmentThu. July 7 2016Eat That Question Frank Zappa in His Own WordsDocumentary on musician Frank Zappa by Thorsten Schutte. Opens Friday at TIFF Bell Lightbox. 93 minutes. 14ATheres no small irony in a Frank Zappa doc being built around the mans interviews since he regarded journalism as a form of torture.""Being interviewed is one of the most abnormal things you can do to somebody else. Its two steps removed from the Inquisition"" Zappa grouses in Thorsten Schuttes engaging film. It pays tribute to the razor-witted musical iconoclast who died of prostate cancer in 1993 at the age of 52.Article Continued BelowThe approach seems limiting -- and it is -- for a gigantic talent who traversed pop rock jazz Ramp;B classical and avant-garde musical styles across three decades and more than 60 albums. Zappa influenced many musicians and other artists first as leader of the Mothers of Invention and later through multitudinous regroupings and transformations.Yet Schuttes approach pays off due to Zappas wicked and wise takes on all aspects of pop culture and modern life whether talking to Jeanne Beker on the MuchMusic forebear The New Music or testifying in the U.S. Senate against Tipper Gores censorious Parents Music Resource Center.He was judged a freak and societal menace by Gore and other blue-rinse meanies and even many of Zappas fans wrongly viewed him as a drug-abusing anarchist. Zappa was in reality a straight-edged musician and artist -- he called himself a composer and entertainer -- as well as a devoted family man as dad to four children.He gets to finally explain all this in his own amusingly hairy and crabby way. For those who still dont get it I quote the immortal kiss-off from Zappas debut LP Freak Out ""Suzy Creamcheese whats got into you?""Peter HowellWiener-DogStarring Greta Gerwig Danny DeVito Julie Delpy Tracy Letts Kieran Culkin Ellen Burstyn and Zosia Mamet. Written and directed by Todd Solondz. Opens Friday at TIFF Bell Lightbox. 88 minutes. 14ASic transit gloria mundi for the beleaguered title pooch of Todd Solondzs latest societal eyeballing which leashes a dogs life to human absurdity.You couldnt ask for a more adorable dachshund who goes by various names and several sets of owners. But you might wish for kinder caregivers.The canine plays straight mutt to the tragicomic life dramas of squabbling parents (Julie Delpy and Tracy Letts) awkward romancers (Greta Gerwig and Kieran Culkin) a failed film professor (Danny DeVito) and an embittered solo senior (Ellen Burstyn).Solondz at first seems to be mellowing the misanthropy that has been his calling card since Welcome to the Dollhouse became a Sundance hit 20 years ago. But following a musical interlude -- ""The Ballad of Wiener-Dog"" by South Park composer Marc Shaiman -- its back to grim business as usual.Peter HowellThe DebtStarring Stephen Dorff Elsa Olivero David Strathairn and Amiel Cayo. Written and directed by Barney Elliott. 99 minutes. Opens Friday at the Carlton VOD July 12. STCBarney Elliotts The Debt deals in murky ethics and exploitation in this well-acted trio of connecting stories set in Peru.Stephen Dorff is Oliver an aggressive-yet-naive American banker pushed by his boss (David Straithairn) to close a massive land-acquisition deal in a remote corner of the country. The mountain-ringed setting gives The Debt some glorious cinematography and a moving second story about the lone holdout hard-faced farmer Florentino (Amiel Cayo). Struggling to feed his family Florentino is relentlessly tough on his sweet-natured son. The best performance comes from Elsa Olivero all grace and quiet intensity as a Lima nurse who does things she never imagined herself capable of to get needed surgery for her suffering mother.Its not always easy to follow the story and curiosity about how the decent became flawed is unsatisfied.Linda BarnardLast Cab to DarwinStarring Michael Caton Ningali Lawford. Directed by Jeremy Sims. 123 minutes. Opens Friday at Canada Square. 14AThis is a road movie where death awaits at the end of the journey.And yet theres something uplifting in the tale (based on a true story) about an aged cab driver and lifelong resident of a dusty Australian town who learns hes dying of stomach cancer and travels to the coastal city of Darwin -- a rather long and eventful journey -- in a bid for an assisted suicide death.Michael Caton gives a powerfully nuanced performance as Rex a man too hidebound by his own racism to acknowledge his love for Polly the ""black"" woman across the street whos his secret nighttime companion.Great performances by Ningali Lawford as Polly Mark Coles Smith as Rexs troubled young companion Tilly and Emma Hamilton as Julie a nurse he meets along the way elevate the film from merely likable to poignantly satisfying.Bruce DeMaraEverybody Wants Some (DVD)Starring Blake Jenner Zoey Deutch Tyler Hoechlin Wyatt Russell Ryan Guzman J. Quinton Johnson and Glen Powell. Written and directed by Richard Linklater. Available July 12 on DVD. 104 minutes. 14ARichard Linklater calls Everybody Wants Some a ""spiritual sequel"" to his earlier Dazed and Confused. Its actually more of a cross between his recent triumph Boyhood by way of Animal House.Focusing on 1980 Linklater observes the moment where the boy became the man in personal recollections more wistful than Dazed and Confuseds 1970s. Music geek Linklater also pinpoints where pop began to morph from 1970s disco and stadium rock into the musical hybrids of today.Blake Jenners Jake and his frathouse bros have a Waynes World moment in a car singing ""Rappers Delight"" the 1979 tune that brought hip-hop to the masses. The film is built around such epiphanies big and small all steeped in the blissful bong smoke of Linklaters memory magic.Extras include deleted scenes and making-of featurettes.Peter HowellThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Financial drama The Debt doesnt add up to its thriller billing - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review Financial drama The Debt doesnt add up to its thriller billing ""The Debt"" Level 33 Entertainment Stephen Dorff portrays a hedge fund banker in ""The Debt."" Stephen Dorff portrays a hedge fund banker in ""The Debt."" (Level 33 Entertainment) Katie Walsh Billed as an ""intense financial thriller"" Barney Elliotts ""The Debt"" only achieves two out of three of those descriptors. The film does feature much discussion about complicated international financial deals but the intense thrills are nowhere to be found.Stephen Dorff stars as Oliver an American hedge fund banker operating in Peru with a local associate Ricardo (Alberto Ammann). The bankers have their eyes on exploiting Perus national land debt issues for their own profit. As Olivers boss Nathan (David Straithairn) starts to question the worthiness of the deal Oliver goes to extremes to get it done while Ricardo only wants to help his people and nation. Intersecting with this is are a story line about a nurse Maria (Elsa Olivero) going to great lengths to get her mother a necessary medical treatment in a country whose social services are being pinched and  a plot that follows a llama shepherd and his son in a remote mountain village Pampacancha -- a lucrative plot of land battled over by various potential buyers including Oliver.The film takes far too long to get going -- the disparate threads arent woven together until over an hour into the film. Despite its best efforts to be thought-provoking the film is dramatically inert slow and its revelations arent all that politically illuminating relying on coincidence and worn tropes to obfuscate its lack of ingenuity. -------------The DebtNot ratedRunning time 1 hour 39 minutesPlaying Laemmle Music Hall Beverly Hills See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-capsule-debt-review-20160620-snap-story.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter,200,thedebt3,thedebt,latimes
