Benson (Jerry Seinfeld right) rides a windshield wiper with Mooseblood the mosquito (Chris Rock). DreamWorks Directors Steve Hickner                   Simon J. SmithGenre Animation ComedyRunning Time 90 minutes (Requires RealPlayer) Jerry Seinfelds publicity juggernaut has made most of the sentient world aware of his new animated comedy -- about a Manhattan honeybee who just sort of bumbles along talking about nothing with his pals and having minor adventures. Until he breaks one of the prime rules of bee-dom and talks to a human. This leads of course to shopping. And when he spots the condiments aisle with its shelves full of Cute Bee Golden Blossom and Ray Liotta Private Reserve honey our hero goes on the warpath. Humans he decides are stealing bee labor so he and all his bee pals quit working -- which means flowers dont get pollinated vegetation turns brown and the world just isnt very sweet anymore. There are laughs -- occasionally some pretty big ones -- but kids are likely to get restless when the humor relies on their understanding legal strategy (the bees sue the human race). Or on their recognizing celebrity voices (Oprah Winfrey as a judge John Goodman as a defense lawyer) most of which are wasted anyway. One exception is a bloodsucking mosquito voiced by Chris Rock. But hes got only a couple of scenes and in between the script rarely rises above the hummm-drum. It just drones along mildly while the visual jokes languish. Its a movie with no particular style to its animation no point to its plot twists and no real reason for bee-ing.

"Bee Movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up Bee Movie reviewed. Bee Movie reviewed. Slate Sign In Sign Up SlateMoviesReviews of the latest films.Nov. 2 2007 1200 PM Bee Movie Everything about this Jerry Seinfeld creation needed more thought. By Dana Stevens Jerry Seinfeld voices Barry B. Benson in Bee Movie In the marketing blitz for Bee Movie (DreamWorks Animation) one story gets told over and over again how Jerry Seinfeld at dinner with Steven Spielberg one night (who picks up the tab in that situation?) mentioned that hed like to make a movie about bees called Bee Movie. Spielberg immediately called Jeffrey Katzenberg his partner at DreamWorks and floated the idea but Seinfeld wasnt really pitching just goofing on the title. Nonetheless he found himself handed a deal that after years of development resulted in his first foray into movie comedy. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. That might not the best anecdote to use for promoting Bee Movie whose story has a cursory jury-rigged feel You can imagine Seinfeld at his desk the next morning frantically figuring out what the hell all these bees were going to do. What he came up with is a curious mix of courtroom farce romantic comedy and ecological manifesto that while not without charm never coheres into a unitary vision. That may seem like a lot to ask of a movie about talking honeybees but even childrens movies--especially childrens movies--require their own internal logic to create a sense of momentum and necessity. Instead Bee Movie--forgive me--flits from setup to setup harvesting laughs wherever it can but never really delivering the sweet sweet nectar of great comedy. Advertisement Barry B. Benson (voiced by Seinfeld) along with his best friend Adam (Matthew Broderick) is about to graduate from college and start work at the hives only business concern the Honex corporation. But Barry in the grand tradition of freshly diplomad movie heroes just cant get motivated for a lifetime of corporate droning. He moons around floating in his parents honey pool and dreaming of something better. Finally he sneaks out of the hive on a mission with the Pollen Jocks a macho team of flower-diving daredevils (this plot element bothered me because arent all worker bees actually female? Would it have emasculated a nation to watch Barry go out thrill-seeking with a squadron of kick-ass ladies?) Flying over Central Park in the movies most exuberant sequence Barry discovers a whole new world of possibility and meets a cute human florist named Vanessa (Renee Zellweger) who saves him from being swatted to death by her Neanderthal boyfriend (Patrick Warburton Seinfelds erstwhile David Puddy). To thank her for saving his life Barry breaks the cardinal bee law and speaks to a human and soon he and Vanessa are having coffee and exchanging Seinfeldian banter. After an awkward middle segment in which Vanessa and Barry appear to be courting--just long enough for adult viewers to begin pondering the erotic possibilities of a human-apian pairing--the movie abruptly shifts to a courtroom setting. Having discovered that humans make a practice of harvesting honey for their own consumption Barry sets out to sue the entire human race. I wont spoil the outcome here except to say that the lawsuit proves disastrous for bees humans and flowers alike (in an unforeseeable coincidence the movies bleak vision of a world without bees eerily presages the current crisis in world apiculture). A few flimsy plot devices and one deus ex machina later the way is paved for bee-human detente and the ongoing existence of pollinated plants on earth not to mention Vanessa and Barrys creepy friendship. Bee Movie is a perfectly good-natured and often clever diversion that intelligently steers clear of  DreamWorks usual Shrek-derived snarkiness (except for two unfunny celebrity cameos from Ray Liotta and--groan--Sting). The animation while hardly innovative looks crisp bright and pleasing. And many lines that are only OK on paper pop when delivered in Seinfelds trademark outraged falsetto particularly when he vents his rage about the humans theft of honey ""Were living on two quarts a year youre putting it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever"" Its Bee Movie s critical misfortune that it comes out only a few months after the sublime Ratatouille another computer-animated comedy about a misfit member of an oft-despised species who thanks to his unique gifts manages to insert himself successfully into the human world. Its not likely that Bee Movies artistic inferiority to Ratatouille will hurt it at the box office though The movies more than cute funny and (at 81 minutes) brisk enough to move families in and out of the multiplex in mass quantities like the social insects we are.

"Bee Movie Unearned stripes | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesBee Movie Unearned stripesFor nearly a decade Jerry Seinfields TV series was good for nothing and I mean this as high praise.Jerry Seinfelds Bee Movie lives up to its name - its nothing more than a cute ""B"" movie writes Peter Howell.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Nov. 2 2007 Animation featuring the voices of Jerry Seinfeld Renee Zellweger Matthew Broderick John Goodman and Oprah Winfrey. Directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner. 90 minutes. At major theatres. G  For nearly a decade Jerry Seinfields TV series was good for nothing and I mean this as high praise.Article Continued BelowIt was clever original insightful and not afraid to offend. Above all it was funny.One thing Seinfeld never was? Cute.Which brings us to Bee Movie the animated project that family man Jerry has chosen as his first major post-Seinfeld outing.Bee Movie is a cute movie. Not that theres anything ... well you know the rest. But cute is not what adults expect from Jerry Seinfeld although children will be delighted.The drawings are downright adorable both insects and humans as if they were designed to go straight onto wrapping paper for a babys gift or a Happy Meal. Seinfelds lead character Barry B. Benson is an agreeable nerd with fuzzy hair and striped attire - actually more Kramer than Jerry. His idea of comedy? A joke that confuses ""watermelon"" with ""Guatemalan."" You dont get? Thats because its ""bee humour.""Barry has a problem. Having just graduated from every level of school a task that takes mere days in bee time hes told hell have to spend the rest of his life in a menial job making honey.Barry rebels. He crashes a squad of ""pollen jocks"" discovers the outside world and falls for a WASP human florist named Vanessa (Renee Zellweger) much to the chagrin of his ""Bee-ish"" parents. He also discovers that humans - horrors - take honey and sell it. He wants to do something about both Vanessa and honey theft but he may not like the outcome in either case.There are many different paths this story could have taken. If Bee Movie had been penned by Larry David the hilarious cynic who enlivened the best years of Seinfeld we could have hoped for a film that found funny in smarter things than puns about rocker Sting or cheap shots at the obliging Ray Liotta and Larry King. But Davids curdled comedy is nowhere to be found in New Hive City the kid-friendly version of New York City envisioned by Seinfeld and his obedient colony of co-writers and co-directors. The use of ""Sugar Sugar"" and ""Here Comes The Sun"" on the soundtrack underlines the films syrupy sweetness.Its like this honey every bee gag imaginable is used most of them worth a smile but not a belly laugh or even a satisfying snicker. The best line in Bee Movie belongs not to Seinfelds Barry but to Chris Rocks mosquito character Mooseblood sadly underused.I have to say it Jerry where is thy sting? We want more ""A"" material like Seinfeld but instead you give us a cute ""B"" movie.

Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld) flies through Central Park with the few the proud ... the Pollen Jocks in the pleasantly funny ""Bee Movie."" Movie review ""Bee Movie"" with the voices of Jerry Seinfeld Renee Zellweger Matthew Broderick John Goodman Chris Rock Patrick Warburton. Directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner from a screenplay by Seinfeld Spike Feresten Barry Marder and Andy Robin. 91 minutes. Rated PG for mild suggestive humor. Click for showtimes. In the world of animated movies theres Pixar (whose ""Ratatouille"" may well turn up on many 10-best lists this year) and then theres everyone else. And even when ""everyone else"" includes Jerry Seinfeld its still second best. ""Bee Movie"" produced and co-written by Seinfeld and featuring an all-star voice cast has some funny one-liners and should be a pleasant enough diversion for the grade-school-age kids at which its aimed. But thats all it is pleasantly funny at best. You walk away wondering what the Pixar gang might have made from this films potentially terrific idea A bee (Barry B. Benson voiced by Seinfeld) discovers to his horror that humans are stealing the honey that bees labor to make and raking in money from it. He mobilizes his hive for a lawsuit with a courtroom showdown in which ""bee culture"" must defend itself against human usurpers. Directors Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner with a team of screenwriters (including two former ""Seinfeld"" writers) find some unexpected humor here. A cameo featuring Sting (yes the real Sting whos clearly a good sport) is almost worth the admission price with the musician languidly fidgeting on the witness stand while Barry accuses him of appropriating bee culture for ""a pranceabout stage name."" Barry who ventures out of the hive and makes friends with a florist (Renee Zellweger) becomes enamored with human food munching crumbs with gusto. ""Thats not even what they eat Thats what falls off what they eat"" he enthusiastically tells a friend waxing rhapsodic about the joys of Cinnabon. And Chris Rock voicing a seen-it-all mosquito named Mooseblood briefly steals the movie. ""Mosquito girls they like to trade up"" he says dolefully of his bad luck in mating. How does a bloodsucking dude compete against a moth or a dragonfly? While the funny lines keep ""Bee Movie"" flying (and grown-ups may appreciate an out-of-nowhere little homage to the poolside scene in ""The Graduate"") the movie as a whole feels a little flat. Perhaps the screenwriters accustomed to the snappy rhythms of TV half-hours and stand-up comedy were a little out of their element in structuring a feature-length film. Some of the plot developments feel nonsensical and not in a good way; a late scene involving a plane flight seems like padding. But the animation is detailed and often charming (note how every bees yellow-and-black sweater has a different pattern) and Seinfelds familiar edge-of-whining tones make for a good fit with the frustrated Barry a bee aghast by the absurd details he observes outside of the hive. ""They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever"" he yelps about the unfairness of humans use of honey. ""Bee Movie"" doesnt touch the bar raised so high by Pixar but it creates a little buzz of its own.

With the voices of Jerry Seinfeld Renee Zellweger Matthew Broderick and Patrick Warburton. Directed by Steve Hickner and Simon J. Smith. (PG. 90 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) The visuals in these computer-animated kid films are definitely getting better. Renee Zellweger voices a character in ""Bee Movie"" who nearly sets a mark for cartoon world girl-next-door hotness - not quite as much of a saucy minx as the mother in ""The Family Circus"" but definitely better looking than any of the women on ""The Flintstones"" or ""Scooby Doo."" Once you get past the eye candy though Jerry Seinfelds first major post-""Seinfeld"" big-screen project is pretty underwhelming. ""Bee Movie"" has a few charming moments and a scene or two with legitimate hilarity but mostly its just mediocre. The storys lack of focus is particularly glaring - the movie starts as an ""Antz""-style insect adventure and then randomly delves into a courtroom drama an environmental parable a save-the-world film and even a romance. The latter plot detour is a particularly big head-scratcher. Youre supposed to be rooting for the lead human and bee characters to make it together but there are just too many logistical questions. Love may be able to transcend their enormous size difference and cultural issues but what about Barry B. Bensons 3-month life span? The plot begins like every other animated movie made in the past 10 years. Benson (voiced by Seinfeld) is a plucky young honeybee who cant fit in because he doesnt want to have the same mundane task for the rest of his life. He ventures to New York City meets a florist (Zellweger) and yadda-yadda-yadda theyre suing the human race for illegally selling all the bees honey. At this point the movie promotes the ubiquitous kid movie ""be yourself"" moral. But even that gets abandoned halfway through as Barrys decision not to be a mindless drone nearly leads to the end of all life on Earth. What are kids supposed to take away from this film other than sexual confusion every time they get stung by an insect? ""Bee Movie"" is not all bad. The 10-minute courtroom scene has several good laughs at the expense of Police frontman Sting and Ray Liotta who goes into full ""Goodfellas"" mode and tries to crush Barry with the 2005 Emmy he received for a guest spot on ""ER"" The Larry King cameo is one of the most tired cliches in movies but Seinfeld and his writers find a way to make it seem fresh here. And Chris Rock has an unfortunately short but excellent scene as a mosquito who offers some interesting insights about his species sexual politics. ""Mosquito girls trade up"" he says. ""They try to get with a moth or a dragonfly. Mosquito girls dont want to be with no mosquito"" Maybe this is a good time to point out that ""Bee Movie"" is a PG film with a few scenes that might prompt conversations with your children on the ride home. (Barry and his girlfriends discussion about a suicide pact is the biggest head-scratcher.) But almost everything in the film is played for laughs with nothing remotely scary. With all the gear-shifting in the plot theres really no room for a bad guy. Seinfelds talent occasionally surfaces. But considering he wrote one of the hippest and funniest TV shows in history theres a surprising amount of corniness and laziness in the dialogue as if each writer was paid by how many bee-related puns they could come up with. (""A perfect report card - all Bs"") You can understand why Seinfeld would want to move on to something new. Unfortunately hes just not as funny in this medium. The jokes are plentiful in ""Bee Movie"" but they are not spectacular. -- Advisory This film contains sexually suggestive humor and stinging-related violence.

The hero of the animated ""Bee Movie"" produced and co-written by Jerry Seinfeld is named Barry. B. Benson but one suspects it was probably changed from Bernstein. His kvetchy parents Janet and Martin (Kathy Bates and Barry Levinson) would be horrified if he married a wasp. They want this college grad to follow in their dads footsteps and work as a ""stirrer"" for Honex where all the bees in New Hive City have worked for millions of years without a single days vacation. But the diminutive Barry has bigger dreams hed like to be one of the macho ""pollen jocks"" who get to spread their wings and go out into the big wide world pollinating plants. To make a not very long story short Barry gets into a load of trouble when he hits New York City on a mission with the pollen boys. He discovers to his horror that humans are exploiting bees for their honey in cruel bee farms and he decides to sue the human race in court. Bees it turns out can talk to humans though its strictly forbidden. Barry breaks this ancient rule to thank a cute Manhattan florist (Renee Zellweger) for saving his life and the two have many pleasant tete-a-tetes on the balcony of her midtown apartment. Talk about an odd coupleIm not sure what kids are going to make of ""Bee Movie."" The shiny vivid computer-animated images pop off the screen with the vibrancy of the Pixar movies but the understated throwaway humor is pure Seinfeld adult observational feasting on the small ironies of human (make that ""beeish"") behavior. Theres slapstick to be sure--a clever sequence where Barry mistakes a tennis ball for a flower and gets whacked around good--but the laughs in ""Bee Movie"" are not of the knee-slapping kind and they dont try to be.Seinfeld wrote the script with Spike Feresten Barry Marder and Andy Robin. The one-liners are often swell but the plot is nothing to write home about. Barry actually wins his case against the human race (I dont consider this a spoiler) but the consequences have dire repercussions for the planet. Who expected--or wanted--an eco-fable from Jerry Seinfeld? It doesnt even make sense on its own cartoon terms why Honex shuts down--these bees werent been exploited by humans so why do they stop working? But then what do I know about bees motivations? Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week What I like about ""Bee Movie"" is its comfy off-the-cuff charm unlike a lot of animated family entertainment its not all Thwack Smash Kaboom. If theres little here to make you kvell theres plenty to make you smile--Chris Rocks funky scene-stealing mosquito Mooseblood; Larry King (""How old is that guy?"") sportingly sending himself up as his yellow and black doppelganger and of course Barry B. Bensons affable oh-so-human stand-up style.

Benson is on a quest to foil honey-eating humans. Wednesday October 31 2007 400 AM Read Jack Mathews Movies in Focus blog Bee Movie. Computer-animated cartoon about a bee who wants humans to leave honey alone. With voices of Jerry Seinfeld Renee Zellweger Matthew Broderick. Directors Steve Hickner Simon J. Smith. (124) PG Some adult humor. Area theaters. Watching this pun-filled cartoon is like falling into a tray of childrens watercolors - the warm end where oranges and yellows and ambers wave. If the movie proves anything its that computers have gone past the ability to simply reproduce hues and tints and can now give the entire spectrum previously unperceived depth. The roses that show up in Central Park here are red to the third power. The bees that fill the screen float past like a million miniature midday suns. Kids are going to adore looking at this movie living in it flying through and above its brilliant landscape. Its an animated joyride over a relief map of Manhattan. I just wish the script was as good as the paint. Jerry Seinfeld who co-wrote the movie with a team that included two veterans from his TV show stars as the voice of Barry B. Benson a young bee about to take his place on the hives production line when he rebels joins an air squadron of pollen collectors and takes to the skies above Central Park. Barry has some quick and traumatic adventures - he gets stuck on a tennis ball being batted around he gets sucked into a cars engine knocked out of the sky by raindrops - and he befriends a gorgeous sky-rise of a human florist named Vanessa (Renee Zellweger). The possibility of romance between the bug and the beauty is as improbable as Woody Allen hooking up with Elisabeth Shue (see ""Deconstructing Harry"") but the kid has ambition and more than that a mission. When he finds out that humans eat honey he does what humans do - he sues What follows is short on logic and high on theatrics. John Goodmans voice arrives in the obese form of Layton T. Montgomery the Southern-fried lawyer defending the industrial honey producers and there are animated cameos by Ray Liotta who is said to have his own honey label and the musician Sting just because it sounds funny. We also hear the voice of Chris Rock as Barrys mosquito buddy Mooseblood who claims to be well-suited for a career as a lawyer ""I was already a blood-sucking parasite"" he says. ""All I needed was the suitcase."" By the way the moral of the story for kids is dont kill bees they have a purpose. And oh yeah dont stare at the sun. jmathewsnydailynews.com Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) is shocked to find his kinds most precious commodity--honey--for sale on the supermarket shelves in Bee Movie. Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) is shocked to find his kinds most precious commodity--honey--for sale on the supermarket shelves in Bee Movie. Photo Dreamworks Bee Movie 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Barry B. Benson is one busy bee. This blue-eyed bounder bedecked in basketball shoes and a black- and banana-striped sweater believes his brethren have been beaten into submission by the barbaric business practices of human beings. Honey is their birthright Barry says. It belongs to the bees who brew it not the bosses busy branding beautiful pale-brown ambrosia for the benefit of bipeds and their beeswax lip balms. (Blast Burt anyway.) In a bid for change Barry brings a lawsuit against those bonehead business people but will he beat them? In the brand-new mostly bodacious Bee Movie Barry (voiced by that bloke Jerry Seinfeld) befriends Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger Bridget Jones) a human babe with a pro-bee bias and embarks on a journey through the Big Apple and beyond. By the end in the best bit of piloting burlesque since Airplane he helps bring in a Boeing for a touchdown. Better watch out These bees kick butt. Seinfeld banged out the screenplay with two sitcom homeboys and a guy named Barry like the bee. The directors are Simon J. Smith the voice behind the blind mouse in Shrek and Steve Hickner one in the bunch who begat The Prince of Egypt. In their busy hands Bee Movie bustles with breezily absurdist bon mots and brief appearances by a broad range of celebrities from boob-tube blabbermouths (Larry King) to biggety British bassists with bristly hair (""Have you ever been stung Mr. Sting?""). The bees bumble though their hive like blithesome Bolsheviks bouncing at their labors along burnished byways in round bumpety cars that all look a bit like bubble-wrap. And when Barry bombs around the burgh with his fellow bees barreling through the blue sky buzzing past bicyclists Bee Movie becomes as buoyant and brisk as the best of the CG kids movies. My own bambino bepraised it highly. Some boffo gags aimed at bigger people blew past him. Chris Rock blusters in and out as a blood-sucking mosquito-turned-barrister (""All I needed was the briefcase"") and Ray Liotta blows his stack in a combustible cameo that looks bizarrely youthful -- behold the benefits of animation. Oprah bobs up as judge on the bench for Barrys lawsuit but the courtroom buffoonery and a blighted late-act breakdown are less brilliant than Bee Movies rainbow blossoms and fabulist bestiary of talking bees. They have a bent for bad jokes. Barry also has a bent for imbibing human beverages; afterward he bursts toward the bathroom at that babe Bloomes apartment building. But how he enjoys blabbing with her over a bite. Barrys mom is billed as Kathy Bates. Barrys dad is billed as another Barry one Levinson of Baltimore while Matthew Broderick beams the voice of Barrys buddy Adam whose bum bestows and takes a beating. But the brightest belly laughs belong to Patrick Warburton as Bloomes tennis-ball-batting beau embittered by this bi-colored emasculating bug who beguiles his girlfriend. Barry is bitter too but only at the big-wig honey barons whove been burgling the bees. And bears come off as bogey-men even the beatific Pooh. Its been said that Seinfeld and his bevy busied themselves four years with Bee Movie. Is it as bold as it might be? Does it blaze with invention? Is it the best babbling-bee urban biopic bar none? Just about. Abhorrers of insects or bumptious binary cartoons should brace themselves. But if youre a boy a girl or a bearer of either it behooves me to say Bravo bees. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Kids Jackets at Columbia Up to 70% off + free shipping Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping Banana Republic Extra 50% off sale items + free shipping w/ 50 Better Life Technology Garage Floor Cover for 130 + free...

Benson a college grad set to begin a humdrum life in New Hive City is asking Big Questions. Hes not sure he wants to spend the rest of his days on an assembly line stirring honey or testing new swat helmets. Theres a world out there and he wants to explore it.Based on an idea that Jerry Seinfeld blurted out during a lull in conversation with Steven Spielberg a few years ago Bee Movie features the voice (and a few digitally rendered facial tics) of the famous comedian and a bit of the gently nutty humor that made his eponymous sitcom one of the greatest shows in the history of television. Alas it really is just a bit of that loopy humor working its way into Bee Movie - along with a string of silly bee puns and a story line that involves courtroom litigation a wayward 747 and yes (shocking) interspecies romance.The romantic angle comes when Seinfelds Barry joins up with a squadron of ""pollen jocks"" to fly through New Yorks Central Park - a swooping aeronautical sequence thats the visual high point of this family-friendly film. After getting stuck on an errant tennis ball Barry finds himself arcing through the apartment window of a lovely flower-shop owner Vanessa (the voice of RenA(c)e Zellweger). She saves his life he breaks the hivedoms number-one rule - dont talk to humans - and the next thing you know Vanessa has dumped her boyfriend (Patrick Warburton) to hang out with this blue-eyed bee in black-and-yellow sneakers.The thing that brings Bee Movie into the courtroom (where Oprah Winfrey is the presiding judge and John Goodman the blustery Southern-fried attorney) is Barrys discovery that the human race has long been stealing and consuming bees honey. He wants to put a stop to it - and to the shameless marketing perpetrated by folks like Ray Liotta who has his own specialty label of primo honey. The Liotta gag is pretty amusing as is another in which Barry calls Sting to the stand to accuse him of shamelessly appropriating ""bee culture"" for his name. Barry blurts out Stings real-life moniker Gordon M. Sumner with accusatory glee.Before it heads into litigious spheres Bee Movies plot closely hews to that of Antz and other animated insect fare where a lone bug tries to break free of a conformist society. Then things kind of go kablooey with the trial and the misadventure with a passenger jet and some funny cameos from a jive mosquito (voiced by Chris Rock).Bee Movie directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner has the vibrant color palette of a top-flight CG cartoon. The key players among the swarm of bees have readily identifiable characteristics (funny hair black-rim glasses a prosthetic stinger) and the humans walk and talk with an exaggerated cartoon-y charm.Bee Movie is not Shrek and it is not Ratatouille either (by far the standout computer-animated feature of the year). But it has enough buzzing wit and eye-popping animation to win over the kids - and probably more than a few parents too.Bee Movie  (out of four stars) Directed by Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner. With the voices of Jerry Seinfeld RenA(c)e Zellweger Matthew Broderick Patrick Warburton John Goodman Chris Rock and Oprah Winfrey.

Thats a reflection of the drug trades lethal paradox the better the product the worse the devastation. A different paradox conditions our response to the film which was directed by Ridley Scott from a script by Steven Zaillian and co-stars Russell Crowe as an unstoppable cop on Lucass case. The better it gets -- and the drama grows in power over its quasi-epic course of 157 minutes -- the more it brings to mind the truly great gangster films of American movie history starting with ""The Godfather"" and extending back to such landmarks as ""The Public Enemy"" and ""Scarface."" Yet these recollections are part of the enjoyment. They lend stature by association to the impressive product on the screen. ENLARGE ""American Gangster"" is based on a true story (a ""true juggernaut success story"" according to the publicity). Frank Lucas who is still with us was in fact a rags-to-riches businessman who took over what had been a mafia monopoly and Richie Roberts the laconic womanizer played by Russell Crowe was the detective and later prosecutor who brought the kingpin down. Truth inevitably turns fictional when a character as murderous as Lucas is portrayed by the buoyant and dashing Denzel Washington but not as fictional or romanticized as you might think. In the grand tradition of gangster sociopaths this extravagant black godfather -- Franks chinchilla coat helps lead to his undoing -- can go from effortless seducer to stone killer in one beat of whatever serves as his heart. Lucas dominates the action though thats not to suggest that Mr. Crowe is overmatched. (This formidable actor has never been overmatched except by a few bad scripts.) He plays Richie as a perpetual high-school kid who happens to be fiercely intelligent. Its a big performance and a beautifully modulated one -- I thought of Wallace Beery -- that makes the role seem more substantial than it is. During long stretches of the narrative Richies main function is to make shrewd assumptions about Lucass M.O. which involves smuggling vast quantities of heroin into the United States inside caskets containing the remains of soldiers killed in Vietnam. (One of those assumptions leads to a thrilling sequence at a stateside air base.) From the very first scene an attention-grabber that does its work shockingly well Mr. Scott and his colleagues -- most notably the cinematographer Harris Savides and the production designer Arthur Max -- provide a densely populated lavishly detailed view of the period. The direction is impeccable whether in the sweeping action of the set pieces or in the department of small talk and murmurs. (The supporting cast includes Chiwetel Ejiofor Cuba Gooding Jr. Josh Brolin Ted Levine Armand Assante and an affecting if overwrought Ruby Dee.) Mr. Zaillians script has more on its mind than cat-and-mouse -- or mongoose-and-cobra -- games. Both Frank and Richie are by their own lights men of honor bound by their own codes; the irony of those parallels is obvious but still interesting. Both go to great lengths to assemble trustworthy teams. And in a reach for more meaning the film draws a parallel between Franks downfall and the fall of Saigon. (Thats not such a reach in a literal sense since his supply channel depends on the Vietnam War.) In the end though the success of ""American Gangster"" doesnt flow from the originality of its ideas or its bid for epic status as much as from its craftsmanship and confident professionalism. Its a great big gangster film and a good one. Bee Movie ""Bee Movie"" isnt a B movie its a Z movie as in dizmal. This animated feature might have been tolerable though for what demographic Im not sure if its hyper vocal star Jerry Seinfeld had chosen to drone. Instead he delivers every line -- every stupid bee joke that he and his cronies could cook up -- with a pounding punishing triumphalism that recalls not the Seinfeld of ""Seinfeld"" but Milton Berle on a really bad night. ENLARGE Jerry Seinfeld provides the voice for Barry B. Benson in ""Bee Movie."" As you may have gleaned from a publicity campaign thats been slightly less invasive than the influenza pandemic of 1918 Mr. Seinfelds character a bee named Barry B. Benson has just graduated from college and cant face a life of making honey. (The storys borrowings from ""The Graduate"" include a swimming pool.) Escaping the hive he goes out into the world as a pollen jock -- a member of an airborne squadron that sprinkles a DreamWorks version of Disney-dust on Central Park -- and falls in love with Vanessa Bloome a florist voiced by Renee Zellweger. And why not since Barry can talk -- his problem and ours is that he cant stop talking -- and her boyfriend Ken is monstrously dislikable. (Vanessa is no bargain either at least for a while.) Why not indeed. Whats the harm if one of the most successful comics in show biz history business gets to buzz around in a would-be comic fable about the bees and the bees? The graphics are pretty enough -- a vision of the hive thats somewhere between Richard Scarry and Rube Goldberg. And the script is not after all content-free. Once Barry discovers that people eat honey he sues the human race for exploiting his species treasure. Its just that the movie aims so low and still manages to miss all distinction. At one point in Barrys honey trial an exasperated defense lawyer asks ""How do we know this talking bee isnt some kind of Hollywood wizardry?"" Would that wizards had left their mark. This is Hollywood hackery.    DVD TIP Theres no more eloquent visualization of childhoods mystery than Victor Erices ""The Spirit of the Beehive"" (1973) one of the most important films ever made in Spain. In the key scene a Castilian village child named Ana (played by 6-year-old Ana Torrent) watches James Whales ""Frankenstein"" at a traveling cinema then takes the film as a touchstone with which to interpret subsequent events in her life. Luis Cuadrados cinematography is as it was meant to be beautiful beyond words.

By Peter Rainer Film critic of The Christian Science Monitor November 2 2007 Save for later Saved Who could have predicted that a decade after the end of his hit TV series Jerry Seinfeld would reenter show business as an animated bee? A gnat maybe or a louse - but a bee?""Bee Movie"" is best viewed as an oddball career move rather than as a successful movie. Seinfeld not only voices its main character Barry B. Benson but also coproduced and co-wrote it for Dreamworks Animation. (The directors were Simon J. Smith and Steve Hickner.) Seinfeld has figured out a way to sidle back into the big time without actually having to show his face. But his vocal inflections his whiny expostulations are as unmistakable as ever and should provide some small comfort to audience members still experiencing ""Seinfeld"" withdrawal.For those of us who dont worship at the altar of that TV show ""Bee Movie"" is unlikely to have much value beyond a few funny sequences. It lifts ideas from sources as disparate as ""Finding Nemo"" and ""The Graduate"" without ever really finding its own groove. Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Barry is a college grad who balks at his imminent career as honey producer in New Hive City. Buzzing about in the human world beyond the hive he becomes infatuated with Vanessa (Renee Zellweger) a beautiful florist who saved his life. Breaking a cardinal bee rule about not talking to humans Barry thanks her and a friendship ensues. Actually it seems more like an infatuation on both sides but lets not go there OK? Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Barry sues the human race when he discovers that people are selling bee honey. Despite his gumption however Barry remains a somewhat generic cartoon character without much edge. Bugs Bunny hes not. On those rare occasions when he shares screen time with Mouseblood the mosquito (hilariously voiced by Chris Rock) Barry fades into the CGI background.Unlike the recent ""Shrek"" entries ""Bee Movie"" at least doesnt go in for a plethora of product placements or a lot of wink-wink in-jokes aimed at the Hollywood crowd. Still I wouldnt have minded a tad more seasoning for the adult audience; too much of ""Bee Movie"" plays like a kiddie show on steroids.Youd never know from this movie for instance that bees are mysteriously dying all over the world. By coincidence I saw ""Bee Movie"" the same week I saw the PBS documentary ""Silence of the Bees"" which predicts dire consequences for the human food supply if the crisis is not averted.But forget that. Why didnt Seinfeld point out that a queen bee typically rules a hive attended to by 30000 subjects and that 100 or so males usually die of exhaustion after 30 days? Now theres a movie.

After all weve logged in so many hours on the sofa watching you and the crew on TVs ""Seinfeld"" we feel we know you. This StoryBumbling Bee Movie Needs More of JerryThe Bee in His BonnetLetter From Cannes Thriller BeeBee MovieView All Items in This StoryView Only Top Items in This Story Unfortunately we also feel a sense of ownership like we know whats best for you. Which is our way of saying hey we saw the bee movie which is actually called ""Bee Movie"" and we had some uh thoughts. Mainly this We have seen real bees and you -- Jer -- are no bee let alone a funny one. If it helps we werent that impressed either when Woody Allen tried to be an ant in ""Antz."" Heres one problem Jer. Comedians are their faces. When we enjoy your comedy we get the full benefit of you narrowing your eyes raising your eyebrows and generally using your face as a medium of expression. So it doesnt tickle us in the least to see you portrayed onscreen as a computer-animated bee with the kind of cheap plastic-looking face youd find on a giveaway figurine in a cereal box. Sure we still get your distinctive Jerry voice but a comedian needs 100 percent of everything when he or she performs timing delivery and physical presence. Even if we got over this muzzling of your mug theres the movie itself. We dont want to declare that ""Bee Movie"" is unpleasant to sit through. Parents and their children could do worse than enjoy an inoffensive computer-animated movie and experience some moderate chortles watching a bee that -- in our revised view -- is under the delusion its Jerry Seinfeld. But what about this premise Jer that a sweet-natured bee called Barry (you) would become so outraged about food companies profiting from honey that he would take humanity to court. So people are ""stealing"" your honey and exploiting bees because . . . ? Were not getting that one. And were even more befuddled by the love connection that springs up between Barry and a human florist called Vanessa (voice of RenA?e Zellweger). Jer youre a bee. Why would you become smitten with a human? Putting dumb logic aside when do we start laughing at the endlessly bee-labored plays and puns on the word ""bee""? (""Was she bee-ish?"" asks Barrys insect-parents when he tells them hes met someone.) And is it really funny that Sting (the singer) makes a voice cameo in your film simply on the basis of his stage name? To us this would have worked better as a wacky conceit in a ""Seinfeld"" show. Lets say a bee stings George on his rear end. Being George he has an over-the-top allergic reaction and while he recuperates he gets this idea for a bee movie in which his pal Jerry plays the lead insect and -- you see where were going? The idea would be so ridiculous it would be funny. Except you thought the idea was a good one and well here we are. As fans of everything computer-animated from ""Toy Story"" to ""Over the Hedge"" we thought that subgenre could do no wrong. But Paramounts DreamWorks division whose animated features -- witty satire for the grown-ups slapstick for the kids -- never failed us before just became formulaic. ""Bee Movie"" feels phoned in on every level. The images usually computer animations biggest draw are disappointingly average. And as for the funny stuff well thats where you were supposed to come in. Yes there are some funny moments when you-as-bee-commentator make pithy observations about winged life. But when the best material comes from Chris Rock as a funky mosquito who claims that his species is ""trading up"" by dating moths and John Goodman as an over-the-top Southern lawyer you know something aint right. Maybe we needed this. We thought -- after the amazing success of ""Seinfeld"" -- you could do no wrong. We loved the way your shows were routinely funny and how they commented so brilliantly on the minutiae of everyday life. But the comedy here the element that most adults and ""Seinfeld"" fans would look forward to isnt happening. And the more ""Bee"" progresses the more we realize how much your voice sounds like a droning bee -- the kind you want to swat away. Bee Movie (91 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG for mildly risque humor. >> This StoryRead +|Watch +| Comments (c) 2007 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Bumbling Bee Movie Needs More of Jerry The Bee in His Bonnet Thriller Bee Bee Movie",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/01/AR2007110102491.html,200,beemovie23,beemovie,washingtonpost

Jerry Seinfeld - a guy who retired to muse about cereal and Superman on his own time after God called him to ask for a loan - has been away for far too long and his foray into kiddie animation is honeycombed with gags that carry that crucial Seinfeldian wit. The story is a bit obvious compared with the best ""Seinfeld"" episodes and the jokes derive more from stand-up riffs (""Why do girls put rings on their toes? Its like putting a hat on your knee"") than character but ""Bee Movie"" is dazzling fun. Jerry is master of a new domain. Barry B. Benson (voiced by Seinfeld) is about to graduate and become a corporation man in the honey business run by Honex which hasnt given a bee a day off in 27 million years. Fortunately for him when he completed three days of high school and three days of college he took a day off just to hitchhike around the hive. Hes not sure what job he wants - his nerdy friend Adam (Matthew Broderick) who seems to have walked in off the set of ""How To Succeed in a Bee Colony Without Really Trying"" suggests something safe - but to impress girls Barry signs up with the ""Pollen Jocks"" the chesty heroes who fly swatter-defying air raids into the outside world to bring back nectar. Their commander (a hilarious Rip Torn) stands by yelling ""You guys did great Youre monsters youre sky freaks"" The scenes inside the hive - like Six Flags in Jell-O with everything blobby and bright - are terrifically inventive in design though when the bees go outside (theyre in Central Park naturally where they could visit the casts of ""Antz"" and ""Madagascar"") the rest of the movie is visually pretty familiar. Barry B. befriends an Upper West Side florist (Renee Zellweger) who saves his life from the murderous efforts of her bee-allergic lug of a boyfriend (David Puddy er Patrick Warburton). In a grocery store a clerk tries to swat Barry with some rolled-up newspaper but he shrugs it off because its only a 10-page circular. What every bee dreads is a rolled-up Italian Vogue. The store sells honey which Barry is shocked to learn is being stolen from the bees so he sues the honey manufacturers (Honron Honeyburton) to get back the sticky gold. Though there is a cheerful tone to most of the movie especially the scenes in the hive - part of what made Seinfeld is his childlike wonder - there is a waspish element to the humor. Chris Rock unlike Eddie Murphys Donkey ventures into making fun of blacks doing a dialed-up Redd Foxx delivery. Hes a mosquito who complains that his species is the lowest so mosquito women want to trade up and date moths. Some of the nastiest and best jokes are directed randomly but not undeservedly at Ray Liotta. And your kids may ask ""Daddy why did the bee say Larry King is very Jewish?"" The ""Simpsons""-style rapid-fire allusions - theres also a brilliant bit featuring Sting (who like Liotta does his characters voice) and a cameo by Winnie the Pooh - are built to be funny today not to compete with Disneys timeless stories. But the sophistication (no poop jokes as in ""Shrek the Third"") means adults will barely be able to take in all the wit on one viewing while kids will miss a lot of it but happily soak up the atmosphere and the stuff about how the little guy can beat the system. Problem Not only are the bees anthropomorphized so are all of the other insects. Your kids will never let you stomp a waterbug again. Be prepared to show them ""Arachnophobia."" Running time 100 minutes. Rated PG (mild suggestive humor).

"Bee Movie | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; bee-movie ) Bee Movie (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The press notes for Bee Movie indicate that Jerry Seinfeld came up with the title before he had an inkling what the story might be. Having seen the film I can believe that. As befits something from Seinfelds pen the screenplay contains a smattering of amusing one-liners but the plot sputters before dead-ending. Its a little weird and a little subversive but mostly its just dull. Moreover while adults may get something out of Bee Movie its hard to understand what it has to offer to kids besides the flashy animation and a couple of video game-inspired sequences. On the whole this is another disappointing animated effort and it resides considerably lower on the totem pole than this years current non-live action champion Ratatouille. As is the case with many animated movies this one starts by taking us into a non-human society where all the creatures have taken on human characteristics. This time its a bee hive and some of the parallels are clever. Since bees dont live very long their entire time in school is nine days (three for grammar school three for high school three for college). They never take vacations. And conformity is not merely a desirable characteristic its a necessary one. Thats too bad for maverick Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld) whose insatiable wanderlust leads him out of the hive and into the wild world. On his first foray he almost gets himself killed but is saved by Vanessa (Renee Zellweger) a human woman who owns a flower shop. She is charmed - not to mention a little startled - by the talking bee and the two of them strike up a friendship. This liaison leads to complications however when Barry accompanies Vanessa to a supermarket and discovers that humans are stealing honey from bees. His solution file a lawsuit accusing the human race of theft. While this allows for some satirizing of the legal system and results in the best line (a mosquito explaining why hes a lawyer) its where Bee Movie goes into a tailspin. The movie tries with limited success to incorporate elements that will keep children (and adults) from becoming restless. Since theres really no action to speak of the animators trump up a little such as a car ride in the bee hive thats like a roller coaster. Or a short sequence when Vanessas friend Ken (Patrick Warburton) tries to do in Barry. There are also no song-and-dance numbers although the film sneaks in ""Here Comes the Sun"" and provides Sting with a cameo. Most of the humor is Seinfeld-dry and the storyline isnt the kind of thing thats going to enthrall many viewers regardless of their age. Its just not interesting enough. Its possible to enjoy the movies satirical bent without becoming enamored of the project as a whole. Bee Movie also has the requisite big-mouthed sidekick (think ""Donkey"" from Shrek). In this case its Chris Rocks mosquito named Mooseblood but his limited screen presence makes him instantly forgettable. The animation and voice work fall into the ""nothing special"" category. The CGI is nice but not the kind of thing thats going to have viewers staring agog at the screen. Ratatouille and even Shrek the Third have offered more impressive visuals this year. The directors both have experience in the field with Steve Hickner having been in charge of Prince of Egypt and Simon J. Smith having helmed Shrek 4-D (the 12-minute theme ride attraction at Universal Orlando) so everything is technically sound. On the vocal side Seinfeld is an odd choice for the lead role because his voice is so recognizable. Its impossible to look at Barry and not see Jerry. Better selections are Renee Zellweger and Matthew Broderick (as Barrys bff - bee friend forever) - they successfully submerge themselves into their roles. The film has a moral of sorts but its not the kind of thing with a strong real-life application. Its about the importance of bees in the life cycle of the planet. I suppose if one wanted to stretch things a bit a point could be extrapolated about climate change and global warming but Im not sure thats what Seinfeld and company had in mind. The film also has some unflattering things to say about lawyers and the legal system - all of which seem perfectly reasonable if a little tame as far as I can tell. Its fair to argue that Bee Movie ventures onto a road less taken. Certainly I cant think of another movie in which a talking insect has dragged the entire human race before a judge whose voice is provided by Oprah Winfrey. Nevertheless while theres something to be prized about uniqueness in a motion picture that quality is only an asset when it enhances the overall entertainment value - something not evident here. Bee Movie will generate some box office interest because of Seinfelds heavy involvement because it is being relentlessly promoted and because it is an animated feature starring a cute little bee. But its hard to imagine the picture generating better than mediocre word of mouth. While it has value as a passable diversion this is ultimately yet another disappointing animated feature in an every-widening pool of them. At least this time it appears that the cause is an offbeat sensibility rather than the laziness and greed that have characterized so many others.

Theres no denying that the jokes in this bedazzling animated feature seem at first a bit conventional if not corny. Jerry Seinfeld who co-wrote and produced the film lends his patented nasal-voiced skepticism to Barry B. Benson a Central Park hive dweller buzzing for adventure. A boyish drone whos supposed to resemble Jerry but looks more like Casey Affleck crossed with the young Charles Grodin Barry gets up in the morning deliberates before picking a yellow-and-black-striped sweater off a rack hung with a dozen identical options then sharpens his stinger like a pencil. What lies ahead for him is a life of noble drudgery. The hive believes in making honey then more honey still all in a cutely convoluted Dr. Seussian assembly-line bustle operated by -- wait for it -- the Honex corporation. Which is why Barry is drawn to the Pollen Jocks strapping daredevils dressed like riot cops whose job is to gather that precious flower dust. Its when Barry tags along with them that Bee Movie comes alive. As he flies into the air the world outside looks so whizzy and strange -- acid-trip flashes of sky leaves and blinding sun -- that its as if Barry were being reborn. The movie sticks with thrilling precision to a bees eye view as Barry rises out of Central Park and buzzes down a midtown block. The images have a spangly clarity -- they make New York look new again -- yet theres a funky bug-world fragility to it all as when Barry catches a flash of himself in a car mirror or later gets plastered onto a windshield along with other mashed victims. (Chris Rock as a lowly mosquito makes each line zing.) Barry lands in the apartment of Vanessa Bloome (Renee Zellweger) a sweet lady romantically linked for no good reason to a lunatic (Patrick Warburton) who never speaks lower than a scream. Barry and Vanessa become friends; he even develops a crush on her. If that strikes you as odd -- shouldnt Barry have some honey of a bee girl hes in love with? -- welcome to the loopy eccentricity of Bee Movie which is just getting rolling. Barry discovers that honey stolen from bees is sold to humans in supermarkets; that many of his fellows are kept in slave labor camps (i.e. honey farms); and that no other bees know about it. Seinfeld voice rising to that nifty incredulous whine perfectly channels our heros dismay. Bee Movie is about how Barry saves the world and without giving more away let me just say that the film is nutty ecological antically funny and moving all at the same time. Its also a fable for our 24/7 worker-bee age. Were used to animated films like Ratatouille that salute those who dont go with the flow but Bee Movie takes a paradoxically fresher tack. In this movie the power of the individual turns out to be overrated. Its the system thats precious and if that message sounds a tad...reactionary Bee Movie finds a touching beauty in it. Whod have guessed that Jerry Seinfeld the maestro of nothing would spearhead a fairy tale about the inspiring glory of punching the clock?

Amiable but no more ""Bee Movie"" puts a hiveful of potent talent at the service of a zig-zigging back-of-an-envelope story thats short on surprise and originality. Long sought for animation work producer-writer-star Jerry Seinfeld contents himself with whimsical notions and mild jokes in creating an independent-minded bee who breaks with protocol to forge a relationship with a human to less than inspired results. Seinfelds name a huge push by Paramount/DreamWorks Animation and ventures mainstream innocuousness should combine for sweet if not blockbuster B.O. Seinfelds patented quirky humor does lend this cross-pollinating tale a distinctive personality one notably less crass and pandering than that found in such other DreamWorks toons as ""Shark Tale"" and the ""Shrek"" sequels. Efforts gentleness and modesty are not unappealing but these qualities simultaneously provide the picture with an underwhelming impact which given the deja vu aspect of certain key elements contribute to its overall ho-humness. Opening stretch recalls DreamWorks first animated venture ""Antz"" with its portrait of a highly regimented community and focus on one youngster whod prefer to go his own way. ""Were the most perfectly functioning society on Earth"" insists Adam (voiced by Matthew Broderick) best pal of Barry (Seinfeld) as the two graduate from school and are obliged to commit themselves to life-long jobs with honey conglom Honex. Despite pics beguiling view of the bee community as one big playground Barry slips off to join the ""pollen jocks"" macho aviators who are the only bees allowed to leave the hive. Squadrons flight into Central Park and Manhattan constitutes the films most exuberant visually adventurous passage. Initially exhilarated by all he sees as the heavy-bellied yellow-and-black pilots bomb around town Barry becomes imperiled by a tennis ball and racquet before landing inside an apartment. There a kind florist Vanessa (Renee Zellweger) prevents Barry from being swatted by putting a glass over him so she can put him outside. Despite the strict bee-world commandment against speaking with humans Barry feels so grateful to Vanessa that he initiates communication with her. Unfortunately in this crucial scene Vanessa is animated to gesticulate and make faces in such an exaggerated and off-puttingly mechanical way that it takes a good while to embrace the character whose empathetic instincts warm Barrys cockles if a bees heart has such. Revealing to his busy-bee parents (Kathy Bates Barry Levinson) that hes ""met someone"" Barry is asked by his mom ""Was she beeish?"" to which he replies that shes ""not a wasp."" Such jokes continue as the script (penned by Seinfeld former ""Seinfeld"" writers Spike Feresten and Andy Robin and Barry Marder author of the ""Letters From a Nut"" tomes) pursues a parallel with ""The Graduate"" that becomes explicit with a homage to the latters famous swimming pool scene. Barry simply cant decide what he wants to do with his life so he follows a line of perfectly modern logic When in doubt sue. So who does Barry sue? Why the entire human race for ""stealing"" the honey Barrys fellow bees so industriously produce for what they thought was their own benefit. A much-publicized trial ensues with a verdict that yields unanticipated consequences for man and bug but which ultimately clears the way for greater mutual understanding between the species. Its a goofy but wispy concept one hardly developed in ways that charge the emotions or ones sense of justice. Nor does the critter/human dynamic here possess the crucial interdependence that it did for example in this summers ""Ratatouille."" Helmers Simon J. Smith (""Shrek 4-D"") and Steve Hickner (""The Prince of Egypt"") move things along agreeably and while the visuals are awash with vibrant colors they lack the intricacy detail and facial nuance of the best computer animation; both ""Antz"" and Monsters Inc."" for example provide infinitely more worked-out hidden worlds for their characters to inhabit. Voicings by an array of top talent are fun and musical backing provides some bounce.
