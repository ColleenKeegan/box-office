In this American teen universe the school canteen looks like the Love Boat the music teacher sits on a throne classrooms look like Versace boutiques and the students behave like all-singing all-dancing shop assistants at Supre.Adults are just facilitators providing mansions cars snacks and annoying advice. In reality adolescence is one of the most painful awkward and clumsy transitions in life. Not in HS3 -- the sequel to two popular telemovies. These frighteningly ambitious self possessed gleaming bleached squeaky mini-adults are presented as inhabiting the pinnacle of human existence -- a place where you cant be too good looking too popular or too rich. In terms of dance numbers character development and psychology its as if Madonna Paris Hilton Prince Donny Osmond and Reece Witherspoon in Legally Blonde have been blended into a big fruity smoothie chock full of performance enhancing drugs.At the centre of this calcium-rich commotion are Troy and Gabriella the IT couple so cute and clever everyone loves them. Theres the Paris character Sharpay and her nifty brother Ryan. But there is no one called Sue Jim Julie Ruth or even Jason. And they are all desperately worried about their futures because of course in modern American pop culture no one loves an underdog (unless its a Hollywood Chihuahua). Troy spends a whole song overcome with nostalgia for the carefree days when he was 7 and dreamed of being a rock star or a super hero. Hows he going to cope with the alternative American reality -- a nation of obese badly dressed creationists gobbling fast food and Prozac as their houses are repossessed?As for education -- its all sport dressing up (does any Australian teenager go to school in high heels?) and the odd pearl from an educator such as the stage can be a wonderful partner in the process of self-discovery. Wait a minute. Correct me if Im wrong but dont we live most of our lives off stage? No wonder these kids give it everything theyve got.High School Musical 3 is so sweet youll leave the cinema with diabetes. And theres a health warning. Dont watch it more than three times (no matter what the littlies say). Facebook Twitter Delicious Reddit Digg what are these?

By Anthony Lane Samantha Morton and Philip Seymour Hoffman in Charlie Kaufmans movie.   Credit Illustration by Robert Risko The hero of ""Synecdoche New York"" is a theatre director named Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman). He runs a successful troupe in Schenectady--so successful that he receives an award from the MacArthur Foundation giving him carte blanche to unleash his genius at will. This is a rare palliative for Caden the rest of whose existence is a rash of displeasure and doom. His wife Adele (Catherine Keener) is a painter of canvases so minuscule that viewers must wear magnifying spectacles to see them. She is also a top-class moper sprawling across the couch when they go to counselling. ""Can I say something awful?"" she asks the therapist a blonde of terrifying perkiness named Madeleine Gravis (Hope Davis) and then reveals that she fantasizes about her husbands death. ""Do you feel terrible?"" Madeleine asks Caden as he digests this news. ""Yup."" ""O.K. good."" Such is the way of this unusual film. It sets up in the person of its central character a monolithic desolation and then spends two hours capering around it so that we emerge at the end not quite sure whether to feel toyed with or ground down. No one could accuse the director Charlie Kaufman of lacking ambition. Few directors these days especially in America are willing to roll up their sleeves and grapple with existence mortality creativity love and the gulf where love was meant to be. There are constant hints of the cultural company that Kaufman hopes to keep; Hazel (Samantha Morton) who runs the box office at the theatre and for whom our hero nourishes a fitful passion informs him that she has just read ""The Trial"" and is then seen grazing the first page of Proust. Nor is it an accident that the play that Caden stages at the start is ""Death of a Salesman."" Its worn-soled sadness as well as the insistence that ""attention must be paid"" to the Willy Lomans of this world carries over to the movies closing act in which Caden declares his faith in extras bit players and other unregarded folk--""Theyre all leads in their own stories"" he says. And what a lot of stories there are. With the MacArthur award Caden initiates a soaring project. Instead of simply directing a play he takes possession of a vast cavernous shell in the city and slowly--horribly slowly--sets about constructing the last word in theatrical happenings. It is decades in the making; a script is followed yet we have no sense of its having been written down; and most of the dramatis personae seem to be based on real figures in Cadens life. Hazel for instance is represented by Tammy (Emily Watson) and Caden himself by a benign beanpole named Sammy (Tom Noonan) who has been following Caden for twenty years as if researching every inch of the role. Of course once Sammy intrudes on Cadens consciousness he too requires a dramatic counterpart so along comes another beanpole and when Sammy is unavailable his duties are bravely assumed by Millicent (Dianne Wiest) an actress who looks and sounds nothing like Caden--and so on and on with every twist in the film sprouting such instant recurrence that it appears no more open to closure than the working out of pi. Heres the question then that must dog any approach to ""Synecdoche New York"" the fundamental things apply in this movie for sure but do they stop it from vanishing up its own fundament? Kaufman has not directed a film before. He remains best known for the scripts that he wrote for ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" both stronger works than this although his fondness for freakish patterns has hardly deserted him. From the title onward (""synecdoche"" sparking against ""Schenectady"") it crackles with crossed wires. Caden sent to an ophthalmologist hears the word ""neurologist"" instead. ""I think I have blood in my stool"" he later tells Adele. ""The stool in your office?"" she asks. The first thing to note about this exchange is that its not very funny; Kaufmans film for all its sophistication is oddly fond of poop jokes and indeed of poop shots. Is there really no better way to dramatize the frail health of your character than by showing the discolored stream of his urine? The problem is not one of bad taste to which the director is welcome but the obviousness--dare I say the dullness--with which he nags away at the sight of debilitation in body and spirit alike. There has long been a strain of sorry lassitude in Kaufmans work and here it sickens into the morbid. Although Philip Seymour Hoffman appears in almost every scene he is seldom given the chance to shrug off his blue mood and demonstrate the dazzling range of which he is capable. One longs for the Hoffman of ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" all crowing tones and carroty crew cut. I have heard him in an interview say how freed up he felt by that films director the late Anthony Minghella but Kaufman seems to be following the reverse procedure. Such zip as we get is provided by performers in the secondary roles notably the women Dianne Wiest Emily Watson and phlegmatic as ever Samantha Morton. (The best gag in the film is that Hazels home is forever on fire; she lives there quite cheerfully never explaining the flames and barely noticing them. Bunuel would be proud of her.) To what end however are these actresses devoting their panache? In short what is ""Synecdoche New York"" about? Well there are three commonplaces on which it repeatedly riffs. One is what you might call the romantic-pathetic theory of imagination any alternative reality that we design and furnish when we conceive a work of art is always to some extent a stand-in for the puny or pitiful one that we have been personally landed with. The second and most imperishable truth is we grow old and perish. And the third says all you need is love. These are noble principles to pursue; unless the pursuit is waged with gusto however it threatens to slump into the sententious and that is what happens here. With so much screen time being allotted to Cadens bad marriage and pustular health problems his majestic production doesnt get going properly until the second half of the film and by then we dont care enough (worse still we dont know enough such is the vagueness of its guiding rubric) to mind whether it triumphs or flops. Compare Dennis Potters great mini-series of the nineteen-eighties ""The Singing Detective"" and you will see much the same setup--a wry leading man with a skin disease inspired by a furious creative itch--rendered with unstinting vigor. And should you still have a taste for the fancies of a fading man try Orson Welless ""The Immortal Story"" or a little picture of his called ""Citizen Kane"" all of which I sometimes think could be floating within Kanes cranium like snow inside a globe. In each case there is joy--not just a mournful snickering as carried in Charlie Kaufmans bag of tricks but the breath of divine pleasure--in the conjuring of dreams. If you want to show a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage go right ahead but give that hour all the life you can. Do you crave some of that tension Kaufman style between the actual and the theatrical but without the screwy stuff? Feel like trading East Coast gloom for the Albuquerque sun? Hows about a title you can understand and pronounce? Its all there in ""High School Musical 3 Senior Year."" For anyone with an allergy to television I should explain that the first two installments of this epic were shown on the Disney Channel in 2006 and 2007 and sold around the world a brilliant outwitting I thought of the traditional process known as cinema. It was something of a shock then to find the third panel of the triptych being displayed on the big screen. After all its winning formula is driven not by narrative but by what isnt there no sex no drugs and no rock and roll--unless you count the logjam of thundering power ballads. Have no fear. Troy (Zac Efron) is still at East High with his wistful determination and his killer eyebrows like a younger and more huggable Leonid Brezhnev. His girlfriend Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) is heading for Stanford although this means leaving Troy a decision that even Aeneas found hard to make. Also on hand are the cheery Chad (Corbin Bleu) the bitchy but bearable Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) and the truly astounding Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) who dresses like Kurt from ""The Sound of Music"" and wants to be a choreographer and dont you dare read anything into that. With the help of the kindly drama teacher (Alyson Reed) a ringer for Mrs. Doubtfire the students do what Caden Cotard tries to do they mount a stage spectacular playing lightly heightened adaptations of themselves. Unlike Caden they pull it off. They even have fun something that never crosses Cadens mind and in so doing they give excellent value for money launching into song the way that normal folk go to the bathroom--regularly politely and because if they didnt well darn it they might just burst. Troys only complaint like that of an heiress in Edith Wharton is that he lacks room for maneuver. ""Do you ever feel like your whole futures laid out in front of you?"" he asks. Given that ""High School Musical 4"" is already in the works the answer kiddo is yes.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

"High School Musical 3 Makes the grade | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsHigh School Musical 3 Makes the gradeWhere most teen franchises are heading straight to DVD or landfill by the time of their third chapters the unstoppable High School Musical is going the other way.By Peter HowellMovie CriticFri. Oct. 24 2008 High School Musical 3 Senior Year (out of 4)Starring Zac Efron Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Tisdale Lucas Grabeel Olesya Rulin and Monique Coleman. Directed by Kenny Ortega. 112 minutes. At major theatres. G Omigod and aint it something?Where most teen franchises are heading straight to DVD or landfill by the time of their third chapters the unstoppable High School Musical is going the other way.And what a way it is. High School Musical 3 Senior Year is the first in the dance musical series to receive a big-screen launch following the phenomenal success of its predecessors on the Disney Channel and home video and in school auditoriums. Watch for it to get on the good foot at the weekend box office where it will likely bigfoot its competition and also end up as one of the years top releases.Its a classic case of giving the people what they want and in this case its more of the same. This applies both to the players - everybody from lead stars Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens to director Kenny Ortega and screenwriter Peter Barsocchini - to what passes for a plot.Still aimed at the post-Pampers to pre-prom age group HSM3 returns us to Albuquerques East High School where rarely is heard a discouraging word - and if one is its immediately followed by a song or dance that makes everything better.The Wildcats basketball team led by shaggy-haired crooner Troy (Efron) are still hoping to win the big game. Troy and his equally tuneful girlfriend Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) are chastefully pursuing their romance even though they know that college and some sort of separation are fast approaching.Scheming rich girl Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) and her dandy of a twin bro Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) who arent really so bad are still plotting to hog the spotlight in whatever musical the talent East High kids decide to mount. And what of that musical? Well after about 30 seconds of pretending they dont want to do one everybody gets right down to show business. ""Plain-looking"" Kelsi (Olesya Rulin who is actually a knockout) once again supplies the tunes loveable crab Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed a real Broadway talent) directs and school buds Chad (Corbin Bleu) and Taylor (Monique Coleman) make their usual high-spirited contributions.Anyone who wonders how all this is going to turn out has either not been paying attention or forgets that Disney is in the business of creating dreams not dashing them. Theres so much formula to HSM the Food and Drug Administration should license the franchise.But thats perfectly all right because everybody knows exactly what theyre about. This series is intended to be good clean escapist fun for hard times a sort of Fame without the life struggles or Dirty Dancing without the dirt and it delivers like Tinkerbells wand.In the alternative universe of East High top-level schools Stanford and Juilliard hand out scholarships like candy rainstorms act as romantic punctuation plates of hot cookies magically appear and love-struck teens drive 1000 miles in a matter of hours.Free of gross-out gags and sexual frolics the HSM series is so gosh-darn wholesome its easy to imagine Sarah Palin having a permanent tape loop of the first two episodes playing over the video monitors of her campaign jet.Crucially though the infectious enthusiasm remains. The move to the larger screen has been accompanied by better choreography with highlights including the Broadway-style Sharpay showcase ""I Want It All"" and the West Side Story-influenced junkyard frolic between Troy and BFF Chad for ""The Boys are Back.""Three new characters are introduced. British transfer student Tiara (Jemma McKenzie-Brown) arrives to gives some amusing All About Eve jitters to Sharpay. Meanwhile Troy and Chad wannabes Jimmie (Matt Prokop) and Donny (Justin Martin) manage not to be completely obnoxious as they pad out the movies thin plot with comic hijinks.Could it all be better? Absolutely. It would be nice if a smidge of reality intruded upon East High and were fast approaching the point where Efron who is cuter than Michael Jacksons monkey is going to wear out his welcome with anyone older than the Happy Meal generation. We havent yet reached that point however. Its entirely conceivable that well see them all back next year for High School Musical 4 College Freshmen and only logicians and people without a song in their heart will have reason to grump.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    20degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Movie review High School Musical 3 1 / 2 Back to Gallery High School Musical 3Senior Year Musical. Starring Zac Efron Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Tisdale and Corbin Bleu. Directed by Kenny Ortega. (G. 112 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) ""High School Musical"" is responsible for its share of ills in the world teenagers with perfectly good faces wanting to get nose jobs. The idea that the word ""Sharpay"" is an appropriate name for a human child. The rise in mainstream popularity of Bedazzler-embossed clothing. But most of the harshest critics of the 2006 Disney Channel movie were people who didnt see it. Ive watched the original movie the stage show and something called ""High School Musical The Ice Tour"" and observed just as many smiling faces on the chaperones as the kids. Admit it or not parents were having a good time too. The series premieres as a feature film with ""High School Musical 3 Senior Year"" and the songwriting and choreography are as exciting as ever. Unfortunately the writing has become so bad that it becomes impossible to keep your head in the game - even as your toes continue to tap to the beat. True ""High School Musical"" was never about the plot. The makers of the tween phenomenon - including director Kenny Ortega the Bay Area native who choreographed ""Dirty Dancing"" - proved that it didnt matter if you borrowed almost every story line and character from ""Grease"" and ""American Pie"" as long as the tunes were catchy and the dance numbers were energetic. But while the first two movies were at least cohesive the writing in the third is a disorganized mess. The story rehashes conflicts from the previous movie manufactures strife where there should be none and forces one-dimensional new sophomore characters into the narrative - presumably so there can be a ""High School Musical 4."" ""High School Musical 3"" begins with a basketball game and one of the most pleasingly kinetic song-and-dance numbers in the series a fast-paced song destined for constant Disney Radio airplay called ""Now or Never."" Ortega and music supervisor David Lawrence augment the spectacle with little touches such as the cheerleaders helping out with the chorus of the song. And everything is bigger and better on the big screen including Efrons basketball skills which became passable at some point in the past 12 months. Troy (Efron) and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) are back at East High School for their senior year where they are deciding their futures. From there we get more of the same from the earlier musicals. The central themes - conflict in the Troy-Gabriella relationship Troys inability to decide between sports and theater and even the scheming by bad girl Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) - is a repeat from the first movie. Except in this case the events never seem to fit together. Important things happen too suddenly subplots are abruptly abandoned and large chunks of the script appear to be missing entirely. The move is a punishing 112 minutes long yet its so fractured there are times it seems as if youre watching the trailer. Efron is once again Travolta-esque although he appears to be quickly outgrowing this material. Hudgens is still annoyingly bland both in facial expressions and voice. (Tisdale is the better singer but she gets fewer songs.) The new actors - including Matt Prokop doing a ""Parenthood""-era Keanu Reeves imitation and Jemma McKenzie Brown as a British version of Sharpay - act cute and slightly obnoxious like the latter-day Scrappy-Doos that they are. The most improved player is Corbin Bleu as sidekick Chad who still has the Sideshow Bob hair but seems to have worked diligently on both his acting and dancing during the break. ""The Boys Are Back"" featuring a junkyard dance-off performance by Troy and Chad is probably the most thrilling number. Bleu is ready for his own leading role if he can get something better than that movie about competitive jump roping (""Jump In"") that he headlined last year. As for the G-rated content parents who might have been worried about the relationship between Troy and Gabriella escalating can breathe a sigh of relief. With hand-holding in ""High School Musical"" and a kiss in ""High School Musical 2"" it would make sense that ""HSM3"" would feature a trip to second base. (And ""High School Musical 5"" would basically be a remake of ""9 1/2 Weeks."") But no worries. If anything Troy gets even less action in this movie. A small spoiler lies ahead Stanford and Cal graduates should be thrilled that ""High School Musical 3"" often feels like a promotional video for those schools with one scene that appears to be shot on the Cardinal campus. The lone problem is Troys statement that the colleges are 32.7 miles away from each other which is at best extremely deceptive. Even without a flaming tanker truck to slow things down the schools are a solid hour-and-15-minute drive from door to door. -- AdvisoryThis movie contains one long kiss some semi-dangerous break-dancing moves and a dangerous-looking tree house.

High School Musical 3 Senior Year (G) Disney (100 min.) Directed by Kenny Ortega. With Zac Efron Vanessa Hudgens. Now playing in New Jersey. ONE STAR 708. OMG I am totes excited to be texting you from ""High School Musical 3 Senior Year."" Except should this be called ""Preschool Musical""? -) The theater is full of 5-year-old girls who are mainlining Icees. The Disney logo just came up. They are already screaming. 712. Big basketball/dance number. Zac Efron and his bros are on the court and everyone has layered haircuts with feathered bangs; theyre like Ellen DeGeneres except not as butch. The team is losing but then Zacs girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens jumps up in the stands and sings and they win. Yay. 718. Zac and Vanessa are at a party and her skirt is so short if she bends over it is so going to be all over the web. Now she and Zac are in a treehouse and theyre clearing their sinuses. Oh no wait its another musical number. ""I wish this moment/was ours to own it"" they just sang. Oh that is so cute. They make up the lyrics as they go along. 727. I think somethings stuck to my shoe. 729. Ashley Tisdale arrives playing a bitchy girl called Sharpay. Which is so weird because I thought a Sharpay was one of those wrinkled dumb animals that lay around waiting for someone to pat them on their oversized heads. And Ashley is not wrinkled. She is however wearing pink pleather which is its own tragedy. 734. Do you think its gum? I hope its gum. 7 41. Some kind of dance number with kids jumping around. One of them is Lucas Grabeel playing a fab teen choreographer who wears argyle sweater vests cute little hats and goes through life doing jazz hands. In real life he would be so totally crushing on Zac; since this is a Disney movie of course hes simply ""sensitive."" 754. Sorry. Started to doze off. 803. Okay the movie is exactly half-over and Im still waiting for something to happen. The kids are -- duh -- putting on a show. Vanessa is torn between doing it and staying in Albuquerque N.M. or accepting her early-admissions scholarship to Stanford University. Wait what? This is a dilemma? 804 ""I wouldnt sing with you if I was starving and you were the last pickle at the picnic."" Okay are they just making up the dialogue now too? 810. Lucas is -- OMG -- going to go on a date with a girl Somewhere a unicorn is dying. Somewhere a rainbow is fading. Somewhere Clay Aiken is weeping huge salty tears of despair. 816. Yeah its definitely gum. I think. 818. Were in a junkyard for some reason. Suddenly Zac is jumping around. So is Corbin Bleu who sounds like a cheese but is actually Zacs non-threatening minority friend (the same way you know Zac is the preteen audiences non-threatening sex symbol). More dancing. Apparently New Mexico is a hotbed of improvisational dance. 827. Woo-hoo I can make Homer Simpson. OE( 8 - l ) 839. Vanessa goes to Stanford after all. Run Vanessa run Except Zac follows in a dark suit and a skinny tie. Did he mug a Jonas Brother? Hes a stalker but a cute one; Vanessa should so totally get his stylist. ""My prom is wherever you are"" he tells her. Awwww. 846. The night of the big show. Will Vanessa and Zac stop Ashley from stealing it? Will the sun come up tomorrow? 851. The big number complete with last-minute arrivals on-stage antics and scholarships from ""Juilliard College."" Everybody is running around wildly on stage. This is followed by graduation day when everybody runs around wildly on the quad. This is to try and conceal the fact that no one can actually dance. 854 Final close-ups of our cast members so we can say good-bye now that theyve graduated. Some of them are seriously crying. I know I am. 855 What the hell is that on my shoe anyway? Rating note The film contains like nothing. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

Martha Tod Dudman could only wonder why her bright beautiful daughter had become an angry stranger. Books on how to be a parent talked only about ""little problems"" such as depression changes in eating patterns and mood swings. ""How about when she is screaming at you and threatening you with a knife and you are crying and she is crying and it feels like the end of your life?"" Dudman recalls. ""Wheres the book for that?"" Here it is -- Dudmans own memoir ""Augusta Gone."" While it never quite answers the questions of what went wrong -- and what finally went right -- its an honest wrenching account of every parents nightmare. The Childrens Defense Fund reports that 1234 kids run away from home each day. And some no doubt are like Augusta -- pretty smart and beloved but miserable all the same. ""It was her despair that upset me most"" Dudman tells The Post. ""In the midst of this terrible anger and fury at me there was this enormous sadness and despair that drove her to suicide attempts. That was the worst."" Where that despair came from Dudman (who changed all the names in the book except her own) doesnt know. As a hard-working single parent she tried her best she says to give Augusta and her younger brother a perfect life in rural Maine close to their father (Dudmans ex) and far from the tumult of city life. It didnt matter. Beginning at age 11 or so Augusta rebelled. There were cigarettes and drugs -- and lies to cover them up. She would skip school and sneak out at night. Augusta would lash out so hatefully at her mother speaking to the teenager was as painful as ""sticking your hand in a garbage disposal"" Dudman writes. Then again mom knew a little something about teenage rebellion. A self-described ""wild child"" of the 60s shed been kicked out of the prestigious Madeira School for pretty much the same behavior. Soon after though she cleaned up her act and went to college. But Augusta wasnt headed for college. The therapist she visited briefly under duress told Dudman that Augusta had gone way beyond what anyone would call normal adolescent behavior. ""She is endangering herself"" the therapist said. ""She is putting herself at risk for rape. She is putting herself at risk for AIDS for an OD on drugs for an arrest for a car accident. ""You cant fix this."" Grasping at straws Dudman pounced upon a ""super-duper Outward Bound thing for troubled teens"" that cost 7000 for six weeks. Dudman took the money out of her daughters college fund. ""I thought there wasnt going to be any college if I didnt get some help for this child"" she says. But the wilderness program didnt change things. The other teens seemed to thrive while Augusta emerged with spider bites all over her face and a scar on her wrist from slicing her own flesh. Next stop a boarding school for difficult kids. It was at the other end of the country in Oregon and cost 50000. Dudman finagled loans and a scholarship believing it was her only chance to keep Augusta safe. But Augusta wasnt safe. She ran away -- twice. Each time the family frantic dispatched people to find her. At last Augusta called to say she was in San Francisco -- hungry homeless and ready at last to come home. ""I told her there had to be rules"" Dudman says. ""You have to work or go to school you cant take drugs you have to be home by 9."" Amazingly Augusta agreed. And when she returned -- thanks to a program called Runaway Switchboard which gave her a bus ticket home -- she was ready to play by the rules. What happened? Augusta -- now 18 and living in San Diego -- says street life helped turn her around. ""One of the turning points was being homeless"" she tells The Post. ""I looked around and the older homeless people were intelligent and so kind. Theyd give me their last penny. And I thought That could be me. They were living that way because they didnt want to live by the rules."" These days Augustas drug-free and happy -- sharing an apartment with a friend working painting -- and dreaming of one day opening an art gallery. Her mothers book she concedes is ""pretty accurate."" ""There are some parts in there she didnt know about"" she says ""but she knew a lot more I thought."" She says things started to go wrong when she was 11 or 12. Frustrated and bored in Maine she and her friends smoked cigarettes and popped No-Doz simply because ""its something to do -- it makes you feel youre doing something youre not supposed to."" Her parents divorce the fact that her mom worked and they lived in a rural area -- none of that she says now had anything to do with what she did. ""It was all me"" she says. ""I was just mad at myself . . . I was a loser partying all the time. And Mommy was the easiest to be mad at because she was there."" If she has any advice for parents she says its this ""Just remember to love your kids no matter what but you cant let them drag you down and pull you into their depression"" she says. ""My mother kept telling me how great I was and how much she loved me. When someone tells you that you start believing it."" When the going gets tough get help IF youre the parent of a troubled teen ""dont isolate yourself when the going gets rough"" says Emanuel Pariser co-founder and co-director of the Community School which Martha Tod Dudman credits with helping her daughters recovery. Pariser says the most successful Outward Bound-like programs are those that cater to all kinds of teens not just troubled ones so theres no stigma in joining. He suggests you investigate any program by asking for references and checking them personally and by calling the state department that licenses the program to see if there have been any problems or complaints. Above all he says go with your intuition. Here are some resources for troubled teens and their parents The Jewish Board of Family and Childrens Services in Manhattan provides skilled clinicians who can make referrals especially for children under 18 with substance-abuse problems (212) 582-9100. Covenant House runs the Nine Line (800) 999-9999 which is linked to 30000 social-service agencies and shelters around the country and is available 24/7. The Runaway Switchboard a free and confidential service mediates phone calls provides bus tickets home and much more. Contact the group at http//www.nrscrisisline.org or (800) 621-4000. The Community School in Camden Maine is one of several alternative schools in the country.

(Fred Hayes) Elizabeth Weitzman Thursday October 23 2008 312 PM We might as well be honest about this right up front. It doesnt really matter what I think of ""High School Musical 3."" And with all due respect it doesnt much matter what you think either. Unless that is you happen to be a 10-year-old fan who has been counting down the hours until Zac Efrons face is blown up onto the big screen. In which case you will absolutely adore it.Efron of course is reprising his role as Troy basketball captain at Albuquerques East High. And if youre still bothering to read this review you probably already know that Vanessa Hudgens is Gabriella his eternal leading lady. RELATED BEHIND EVERY STEP OF ""HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3""Actually the gang from the Disney Channels first two ""High School Musical"" specials is all here from Troys best bud Chad (Corbin Bleu) to shamelessly spoiled Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale having fun as always). Now that its senior year the kids have to face their futures while planning for the spring musical the prom and graduation. Troys dad wants him to accept a basketball scholarship but Troy is more interested in a slot at Juilliard. Then again theres only one spot available at the arts school and both Sharpay and her twin Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) are determined to snag it. Meanwhile Gabriella has been accepted into an honors program at Stanford but doesnt know how to tell Troy about it.RELATED ""HSM3"" GRADS ON TOP OF THE WORLDBigger doesnt always mean better but the folks behind the ""HSM"" franchise - especially director/choreographer Kenny Ortega - have made the most of the move to the multiplex. Thanks to an obviously expanded budget the sets are fancier the musical numbers splashier the costumes cooler. Thats not to say this isnt the ""HSM"" we all know and (sometimes secretly) love; the cheese factor remains and happily so. Yes Efron still gets a little goofy when he does his solo numbers. Of course the story line is instantly forgettable. And sure its kind of weird watching twentysomethings play high schoolers with all the purity of a 1950s fantasy.RELATED MUSIC OF ""HSM3""  TOO CRUEL FOR SCHOOLBut its hard to complain about a pop culture phenomenon built on unabashed innocence. And anyway we might as well get used to it Neither the movie nor the passionate tween squeals at a recent preview leave any doubt that ""HSM 4"" is on its way - or that the inevitable ""College Musical"" will be far behind.eweitzmannydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

It stars Zac Efron a young fellow of such flawless matinee-idol good looks that he could well have been manufactured in a plastics factory. Set in an immaculately clean Albuquerque high school the film offers an America of balanced gender quotients perfect racial mixtures social conformity unquestioningly supportive parents universal teen virginity gourmet school canteens universities on tap prom fixations detached mini-mansions plush flowerbeds alpine vistas and insipid meaningless pop tunes. Irony is very much on the blacklist. Its the kind of film you imagine well all be sat in front of by the future world high commander when were all brain-drained zombie automatons Totalitarian Gap Models Sing Pop is what it should be called. Parents might find solace in the fact that High School Musical contains no product placements but then the film is the product - one long gaudy squeaky-clean advertisement. And when we leave the cinema we can expect to be drowned mercilessly by the merchandising tsunami that follows. Its possible that - for perhaps the first time ever - youll actually wish the film had more product placement just something anything to connect it to reality. Indeed High School Musical 3 is a film that is so disengaged with the real problems faced by young teenagers that it makes Dirty Dancing look like Les Quatre Cents Coups. The bottom line is if youve not already booked tickets for the entire family think twice before being caught up in the hype. At best youll be disappointed; at worst youll want to blow up a high school.

Just because its a movie to be watched for FUN and not boring facts doesnt mean its bad. Just because a teen says its good doesnt mean its bad. I love HSM. Its fun joyful excellent music and I dont watch sequels to movies I dont like.

Yours too probably if theyre between the ages of 6 and 14. But it must be said The romance between Troy and Gabriella is the most-boring thing about High School Musical 3 Senior Year. (Pause to duck flying toys.) The fact that theyre played by real-life loves Zac Effron and Vanessa Anne Hudgens does nothing to improve their chemistry. The fact is their scenes are listless pedestrian - boring. Contrast them with anytime Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) is on-screen singing dancing and most of all admiring her own narcissistic self. Theres a spark there even in a movie that struggles with the third-time-around blues thats lacking between the ostensible ""stars."" Maybe were overthinking this. But the license-to-print-money franchise has made the jump from Disney Channel phenomenon to the big screen. Its asking more of its audience - namely the price of a ticket - and its only fair to judge it on those terms. And on those terms its OK. The story of the final year for the kids weve come to know so well at East High isnt as good as the original which caught everyone (including Disney) by surprise. How could it be? The third time around things are bound to get a little stale and they do. The songs the dance numbers the characters - nothing packs the punch of Were All In This Together the finale of the original that summed up the heart of the series. In HSM3 as the cool kids call it Troy and Chad (Corbin Bleu) are seemingly bound for basketball scholarships at the local college much to the delight of Troys dad (Bart Johnson). Gabriella has been accepted to Stanford her moms dream. (Detect a trend?) Sharpay and her twin brother master choreographer Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) are up to their usual tricks. Theres a movement afoot to put on one last show. No one is much interested but Gabriella talks the gang into it. But theres a twist Representatives from Julliard will be in attendance choosing one lucky senior for a scholarship. (Cue rivalry.) Everyone will have decisions to make particularly Troy and Gabriella about their future and (gasp) their relationships. A couple of new characters are introduced seemingly to carry on the series if possible. If Matt Prokop and Jemma McKenzie-Brown arent given much to do at least the introductions are out of the way. Director Kenny Ortega once again stages elaborate dance sequences. Tisdale gets the best songs especially the youngish-Madonna-like I Want It All. Grabeel has grown the most as a performer and its nice to see Olesya Rulin get more screen time. But as the characters seem to convey in the somewhat-meta finale High School Musical has been good for them. It was fun while it lasted but its time to move on.

ABOUT THE MOVIEHigh School Musical 3 Senior Year  1/2 (out of four) Stars Zac Efron Vanessa Hudgens Ashley Tisdale Corbin Bleu Lucas Grabeel Monique ColemanDirector Kenny OrtegaDistributor Walt Disney PicturesRating GRunning time One hour 40 minutesOpens Friday nationwide By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Its not much of a surprise that the massively popular High School Musical teens have sung and danced their way onto the big screen. A change of venue was an obvious no-brainer for Disney execs who know a cash cow when they see and hear one. The masses of children tweens and early teens who loved the first two Disney Channel installments will surely enjoy seeing the attractive cast again in High School Musical 3 Senior Year. They probably wont mind that the story is thin and that a bigger budget doesnt necessarily mean better. In this instance bigger is pretty much the same. But why fix a formula that works for its target audience and is anything but broken? QUIZ Test your High School Musical knowledge PHOTOS Check out the costumes from HSM3 POLL Vote for your favorite HSM song NEW KIDS Meet three East High up-and-comers LISTEN UP How does the HSM3 soundtrack rate? MORE Skys the limit for HSM3 at the box office Thats not to say the extravagantly choreographed musical numbers are not exuberant. They are. But the plot is almost incidental and characters never go beyond one-dimensional. Theres the requisite teen romance the bratty girl who seeks to thwart things the eccentric but supportive teacher and a bit of bland conflict. What grabs and keeps our attention are the pretty faces infectious songs and eye-popping dance moves. The style of the songs (which are catchy then quickly forgettable) varies between rock-lite hip-hop-lite and generic pop ballads. Troy (Zac Efron) leads East High Schools basketball team to a championship victory as he and his teammates sing dance and shoot hoops. But its a bittersweet time. High school days are coming to a close and college is looming. But first of course the kids have to put on a show The drama teacher (Alyson Reed) has invited recruiters from Juilliard who will attend the senior musical and award one scholarship. The ever-scheming Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) is hoping for the starring role as well as a place at Juilliard. Also vying for the single spot is her more talented and likable twin brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel). A forced conflict is cooked up involving Troy and his brainy beloved Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens). Lest it seem the franchise might come to an end rest assured that younger students are being groomed to take over for their senior counterparts. English transfer student Tiara (Jemma McKenzie-Brown) will probably assume the attention-seeking Sharpay mantle and a pair of goofy new basketball players will presumably try to fill the shoes of upcoming graduates Troy and Chad (Corbin Bleu). This threequel is a major showcase for the charisma and talent of heartthrob Efron. The movies highlight is The Boys Are Back a rousing number that features Efron and Bleu and some great choreography in a junkyard full of inventive props. Director Kenny Ortega (Newsies) gets props for ensuring a place for musical theater in the hearts of a new generation. And with the latest plethora of gross-out bathroom humor in movies aimed at a young audience High School Musical 3 really does emerge like a breath of fresh air. Even if the refreshing gust doesnt stay with you long its fun while it lasts. (Rated G. Running time 1 hour 40 minutes. Opens tonight in select theaters and Friday nationwide.)

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint First allow me to out myself. I was the star of my high school musical (the reviews were ... kind). So when I tell you I wish ""High School Musical 3"" was much better than it is understand I write not as a curmudgeon begrudging young kids their fun but as a veteran disappointed that it misses its potential. Its decent. It should have been great. Tween heartthrob Zac Efron stars as Troy an Albuquerque East High senior with three loves basketball theater and Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens). Troys dad is pressuring him to pursue sports at his hometown alma mater but Juilliard beckons with a performing arts scholarship. But how could he deal with separation from his steady girl who will be at far-off Stanford? The only way to resolve these conflicts is with nonstop songs and dance. Orbiting around Troy are his best buddy Chad (Corbin Bleu) Chads honey Taylor (Monique Coleman) pampered stage-hog Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) and her fabulous brother choreographer Ryan (Lucas Grabeel). They put on a show with production values that would shame golden age MGM (East High apparently isnt experiencing any budget cuts) and work out their crushes rivalries and worries onstage. The screenplay by series creator Peter Barsocchini cobbles together scenes from the basketball championship game to prom to the big spring stage show finding musical cues at every stop along the way. The peachy keen squeaky clean ambience of the Disney Channel movies remains intact in this third installment. The series celebrates the pure sunny joys of innocence. Unlike the Harry Potter films which test their characters in increasingly painful challenges as they mature the guiding principle here appears to be ""Dont mess with success."" Or perhaps ""Keep it simple stupid."" The film has one purpose to be cheerful. Antagonists worries any kind of emotional roughage that might enrich the mix are rigorously excluded. HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3  out of 4 stars Rating G. So in place of songs that illuminate character frame a situation or advance the story -- as in ""Grease"" ""Hairspray"" and classic Disney musicals -- we get bland ballads with lots of heart but little personality. Theyre not lyrically distinguished or melodically memorable. They dont feel like theyre expressing the characters deepest feelings. But theyre upbeat. The dances are inserted into the proceedings awkwardly not where the story demands them but theyre visually busy and energetic. Efron smiles and flips his bangs fetchingly and when he slips off his basketball jersey you can hear girlish gasps all over the auditorium. Hes a nice chaste transitional fantasy for girls who have outgrown My Little Pony but his acting chops dont match his appearance. Tisdale makes a meal of her spoiled-fashionista role and Grabeel is both fey and dashing as her gender-questionable brother. Whats unfortunate isnt that this is a bad film but rather that it had the potential to be such a good one and fell short.

The first two installments of the franchise broadcast on the Disney Channel were pleasant enough. But to witness Number 3 explode on the big screen in a theater hopping with fans is to experience Beatlemania for the millennials. Not since A Hard Days Night have I seen such collective blissout. (If only HSMs music were that memorable) For those who tuned in late HSM is the buoyant saga of hoops kings and drama queens at Albuquerques East High. The stories pivot on Troy (Efron) a basketball star blessed with blue-crush eyes a passable baritone and swivel hips that are just what the director ordered for the annual spring musicale. The films take it as a given that some think it uncool and borderline unmanly for a guy to sing and dance. And they dont care what the arbiters of cool and manly think. The principal charm of the series a throwback to 50s musicals with boys in pompadours and girls in ponytails is that it thinks its cool to be yourself whoever that is. When Troy beholds the lovely brainiac Gabriella (Vanessa Anne Hudgens) she of the kitten face and catlike gait the only thing permissable in a G-rated film is for him to hum and hoof his R-rated feelings. But now that its his final year at East Troy isnt in a singy/dancy mood. Hes reliving his basic dilemma this time framed as the question Basketball or Broadway? With athletic recruiters at the championship game and drama-school recruiters at the musical Troy is an exposed nerve of performance anxiety and indecision. Director Kenny Ortega the man who deserves thanks for introducing musical theater to a new generation opens the film with an extreme close-up of Troy anxious on the court overwhelmed by parental and peer expectations. He doesnt know who he is a theme that resonates through the film - and with its intended audience - as Troy finds himself. His friends know where theyre going. Gabriella to Stanford best bud Chad to State and rich kids Sharpay and her twin Ryan to theater school. As Troy worries about what he wants the twins (Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel) know that they ""want it all"" and sing it out in a glittery babes-on-Broadway dream sequence that is one of HSM 3s two standout numbers. The other ""The Boys Are Back"" performed by Efron and Corbin Bleu (as Chad) in an auto junkyard proves that musicals boast muscle as well as tinsel. Efron and Bleu dance on spare tires and with spare parts playfully making their characters transition from boys to men from the kids who play with tools to the professionals who use them.For the most part the films musical numbers are dynamic propelling the story forward. The same cannot be said about Peter Barsocchinis colorless screenplay.While Troy ultimately resolves his conflict the filmmakers do not resolve theirs. That Hudgens is a stronger singer than dancer and Efron the reverse makes their musical pairings lopsided but no less sweet. Romantically linked offscreen Efron and Hudgens make it hip to be square. And yes dear readers they kiss. Contact movie critic Carrie Rickey at 215-854-5402 or crickeyphillynews.com.

"Grading on a Groove washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On >> This StoryRead +|Talk +| Comments Movies Grading on a Groove After two TV movies ""High School Musical"" graduates to the big screen. (By Fred Hayes -- Disney Via Associated Press) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday October 24 2008 The theatrical debut of the monster Disney Channel hit ""High School Musical"" raises several urgent questions Will the TV movie franchise translate to the big screen? Will Troy (Zac Efron) stay in New Mexico to play basketball for the local university or go to New York to be the Romeo of Juilliard? What will become of his made-in-heaven romance with the brainy and beautiful Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens)? This StoryHes Too Much Like My BrotherMovies Grading on a GrooveFriday Oct. 24 at 1230 p.m. ET At the Movies With Ann Hornaday And for the love of Bob Fosse and all thats holy what is Gov. Bill Richardson putting in the school lunches out there? Set in the preternaturally clean and well-lit East High School ""High School Musical 3 Senior Year"" offers a resounding yes to the first question splashing brightly across the screen like a spilled bag of Skittles. A nonstop barrage of poppy power ballads and ambitious production numbers this is a movie that unapologetically subscribes to the ""more is more"" school of entertainment with each sequence proving somehow more dazzling than the last. Like last summers ""Mamma Mia"" its also a movie aimed laserlike at one constituency the fans. But unlike that train wreck of miscasting and forced cheer and despite its own synthetic overprocessed production values ""High School Musical 3"" exudes genuine appeal thanks to director Kenny Ortegas brilliant choreography and a gifted cast. That hyper-talented ensemble is headed by the bedroom-eyed Efron a startlingly handsome young man who at 21 still manages to play a tortured 18-year-old with credibility. As ""High School Musical 3"" opens Troy and his best friend Chad (the wonderful Corbin Bleu) are pulling out yet another victory for the Wildcats basketball team and Ortega uses the game as his first opportunity for an ingenious song-and-dance number involving the team their fans and two squads of limber cheerleaders. Ortega keeps the showstoppers coming with metronomic precision from an over-the-top fame-and-fortune fantasy number performed by twins Ryan and Sharpay Evans (Lucas Grabeel and Ashley Tisdale) and Troy and Chads muscular dance duet set in a junkyard to a make-you-queasy sequence in which Troy agonizes over his future while the walls of East High slip and slide like a midway fun house. The future is what tempts and frightens the characters who have become beloved friends since Disney made the first ""High School Musical"" TV movie in 2006. With graduation the prom and the years final school musical looming everyone it seems has a decision to make -- including Gabriella who must choose between going to the prom with Troy or leaving early for a freshman honors program at Stanford. Okay okay At a time when many families dont know if they can afford to send their kids to any college the agonies visited on the East High kids seem pretty low-stakes. But thats what makes the escapism of ""High School Musical 3"" so welcome -- that and the utterly believable chemistry of Efron and Hudgens who acquit their duties as this generations Frankie and Annette with easygoing charm. With its appealing cast and eye-popping dance numbers its a shame that ""High School Musical 3"" falls flat when the players open their mouths to sing. Thats when all pretense to spontaneity and warmth disappears and instead of recognizably human voices weirdly synthesized noises come out as if the entire cast had studied at the Peter Frampton School of Vocalization. The klutzy karaoke is at its most distracting during Efron and Hudgenss duets -- especially one set on Easts garden rooftop culminating in one of the movies frequent cloudbursts. Still when Troy Gabriella Sharpay and the rest of those cockeyed kids get together for yet another gleeful ensemble number its nearly impossible not to be taken in. As hes proved before in such classics as ""Dirty Dancing"" and ""Newsies"" Ortega is a master choreographer especially with big group numbers in which he combines the athletic style made popular on MTV and the jazzier more classical moves of Jerome Robbins (not to mention Mr. Fosse himself). Even at its most calculated and ersatz Disney should be commended for giving a generation raised on animated musicals such as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" their own tweenified toe-tappers thereby keeping the endangered genre of the big movie musical alive to step-ball-change another day. And who knows? ""High School Musical 3"" just may inspire its fans to discover the forms masterpieces on Netflix -- and find out that musicals can be a lot more than just syncin in the rain. High School Musical 3 Senior Year (112 minutes at area theaters) is rated G. >> This StoryRead +|Talk +| Comments (c) 2008 The Washington Post Company Network News X My Profile Friends Activity View More Activity  Hes Too Much Like My Brother Grading on a Groove Friday Oct. 24 at 1230 p.m. ET At the Movies With Ann Hornaday",http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/23/AR2008102302169.html,200,highschoolmusical3senioryear20,highschoolmusical3senioryear,washingtonpost

Malcolm Lowry Saint Jack) we find Jake (Jonno Roberts) a footloose American hedonist in Thailand blowing his rents retirement funds on getting blown. Lonesome he flies out his kid brother (Tate Ellington) an un-laid squirmy introvert for a taste of highlife in the Land of Smiles. This King of Marvin Gardens redux is a pale excuse for a cinematographers holiday with actors along as compositional place holders. Dueling for Worst Performance honors are a teeth-gnashingly flustered Ellen Burstyn as the boys forsaken mother (""You have to watch out for the AIDS bacteria"") and Josef Sommer as their father seen clicking through Thai porn sites -- a handful of scenes with them and youre ready for exile. It doesnt help that auteur Seth Grossman dispenses press-kit head slappers like ""The way these brothers take care of the elephant reflects the way America tries to take care of the world."" But featured French-Thai actress Florence Faivre is a knockout and DP Diego Quemada-Diez was clearly hot to expose film while adrift in the ocean of party lights. Equivalent to a crummy band with a monster of a drummer who convinces you to stay for the whole show anyways. (Sunset 5) (Nick Pinkerton) FRONTRUNNERS The great American student-government election Teenagers exposing their fragile egos to public ballot-box rejection and spending a small fortune on poster board all for the possible distinction of assigning Homecoming subcommittees and allocating school funds for a laminator. This is the stuff of which Frontrunners is made. Caroline Suhs doc exists somewhere between Robert Drews Primary and reality TV following the 2007 election cycle at New York Citys cream-of-the-crop Stuyvesant High School where the student (busy)body is made up of potential valedictorians from every borough. That the student-government ""popularity contest"" is a microcosm of the adult political arena is an old saw -- see Kurt Vonnegut Jr.s perennially quoted ""High school is closer to the core of the American experience than anything else I can think of."" To that idea we owe primary-season think pieces recasting Alexander Paynes Election with Barack and Hillary as well as Frontrunners savvy election-eve release date. Tactfully avoiding actual policy details and emotionally sticky stuff cutting for punch lines and overlaying campaigning montages with a playlist shuffle of kazoo-whimsical indie feyness Suh shows herself ever-happy to settle for the shallow rewards of pop documentary here. Depending on your level of fatigue with The Other Campaign this may be good enough. (Nuart) (Nick Pinkerton) THE GAY BED amp; BREAKFAST OF TERROR The Gay Bed amp; Breakfast of Terror delivers on its title with less subtlety. An opening musical number titled ""Watch Out for the Straights"" sets the tone. (Heterosexual sins driving sedans bad hair.) Writer-director Jaymes Thompson aims five incredibly generic gay/lesbian couples (plus one token obese hag) at the titular venue only to have them picked off by Jesus-crazed freaks. Since slasher movies are famously obsessed with picking off copulating straight teens and minorities consider this a counterstrike. The big idea here is that mother Helen (Mari Marks) wants to convert a gay man to marry her lesbian daughter Luella (Georgia Jean) redeeming two sins at once. So the crazed hypocritical lustful and ugly woman -- and her repressed offspring -- get pitted against 10 fine specimens of urbane all-queer-all-the-time stereotype whose only real interests are being fabulous and fashionable. You could argue that this is just gay camp taken to its extreme but then whats with the shrieking drag queen screaming ""Why are all the beautiful people gay?"" Theres no joking here only a sincere belief that anyone who isnt a sophisticated urban queer is a mouth-breathing Reagan fanatic panting to give a homosexual beat down.

Sep. 13 600pm GOD AND GAYS BRIDGING THE GAP Actress turned director Luane Beck is not the first to pusheth thy hot button on the subject of reconciliation between homosexuality and religion but worse than being a mere latecomer her God and Gays Bridging the Gap arrives after documentaries like For the Bible Tells Me So and Trembling Before G-d have already mined the material with greater sagacity. Is being gay a choice? Does a gay agenda exist? Can someone lead an LGBT lifestyle and a holy one? These arent new or particularly profound questions today though the film addresses them as if it were breaking new ground which soon reeks of vanity project. Strolling down the boardwalk Beck walks hand in hand with her real-life partner and producer Kim Clark pretentiously reenacting conversations theyve had about their own spiritual grapplings. The Rev. Deborah L. Johnson an out lesbian who officiated their partnership proves the only enlightened speaker in their hideously shot gallery of dry talking heads but as soon as her arguments get meaty (Is love the same as sexuality? Could biblical condemnation of gays stem from mis-translation or is it simply an outmoded text that was never meant to be taken as directive?) Beck skimps on the follow-up queries. Most of the interviews are strictly anecdotal -- memories of personal triumph or loss that might provide catharsis to those in similar roles -- but with so much political controversy in the air this is a missed opportunity of Religulous proportions. (Grande 4-Plex) (Aaron Hillis)  HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3 SENIOR YEAR My child made me promise I wouldnt come on all 60s-righteous about this one and Lord knows how Ive tried to focus on the potential of Zac Efron Vanessa Hudgens and all the other vanilla muffins making their leap from small to big screen. But truly High School Musical 3 Senior Year is as far as all but one of the cast (Ashley Tisdale a lone standout as the mildly mean girl Sharpay) will be going other than straight to Dancing With the Stars. Set against a production design seemingly inspired by the American flag director Kenny Ortegas choreography is industrial and efficient if haplessly stranded somewhere between Michael Jackson and the Village People. Should we be grateful that no one in this color-blind class-free odorless and colorless crew does heroin gets pregnant or jumps off a cliff? Maybe but unless you call ""Should I go to Juilliard or Berkeley?"" a heavy dilemma HSM 3 isnt about anything beyond the impulse to burst into tuneless song and dance every five minutes interwoven with a wan ripoff of All About Eve. However theyve colluded in making HSM one of the most lucrative TV youth franchises ever the worlds tweens and teens deserve better than this bottomlessly bland pap. On the way home we rented West Side Story and Hairspray. (Citywide) (Ella Taylor) GO  LET THE RIGHT ONE IN Terrible title brilliant film. In 80s Stockholm an outcast boy named Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) is routinely bullied at school until a mysterious girl his age Eli (Lina Leandersson) moves in next door. She too feels isolated and rejected by the world outside but for very different reasons; could be I dunno something to do with her taste for human blood and ability to fly. Tomas Alfredson whose prior credits are primarily on Swedish TV shows makes an astute leap to the big screen with this coming-of-age/horror hybrid that not only delivers gorgeous wintry panoramas but also the requisite metaphors -- in this case vampirism as both adolescent power fantasy and terminal-disease medicament. When it comes to preteens as eternal vampires Kirsten Dunst in Interview With the Vampire used to be the gold standard; in Leandersson I think we have a new champion. And if you ever wanted to know what exactly happens to vampires if they enter your house without being first invited across the threshold this may be the first movie to show the consequences in graphic detail. (Sunset 5; Playhouse 7) (Luke Y. Thompson)  MAX PAYNE If Oscars were handed out for fake snow director John Moores bleary dreary sub-Sin City big-screen video game would clean up like Ben-Hur by the 50th exterior shot strewn with fistfuls of art-directed dandruff a viewer stuck in this film noir snow globe feels like W.C. Fields in ""The Fatal Glass of Beer."" Trudging sullenly through Moores winter wonderland is avenging lawman Mark Wahlberg tracking the syndicate responsible for his familys murder. The role requires Wahlberg to run the gamut of emotions from A to A as he opens doors glowers assembles guns glowers points guns glowers -- and for a big finish glowers. (Even if he endows Max Payne with min brayne the actor still comes off better than Mila Kunis a vengeful assassin by way of a Macys makeup counter or Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges who plays badass Lieutenant Bravura as if his name were Rookie Nondescript.) At least the summers dunderheaded Wanted indulged its thrill-junkie jones for destruction without shame Apart from one cool effects shot of a dragon-winged demon whisking a thug from a high-rise window -- youve seen it in the trailer -- and a constructivist fistfight rendered in comic-book panels of discrete motion this joyless humorless third-person-shooter cheats even on its modest promise of mindless mayhem. The only moment that even mildly ruffles the harbinger-of-doom PG-13 rating belongs to future Bond girl Olga Kurylenko who peels off her dress with NC-17 aplomb -- then vanishes from the movie proving more adept than anyone else involved at dodging a bullet. (Citywide) (Jim Ridley) NOAHS ARC JUMPING THE BROOM Modeled heavily on Sex and the City (problem 1) and set in West Hollywood (problem 2) the canceled Noahs Arc cable series followed the same-gender-loving Negro lives and loves of 20-something struggling screenwriter Noah and his three older if not always wiser friends Ricky Chance and Alex. Like the cinematic version of its maternal root the Noahs Arc film Jumping the Broom centers on the bumpy road to marriage -- an especially timely subject to which the film brings heavy-handed polemics teary bust-ups and reconciliations and lots of slapstick comedy but no real insight or depth. After settling on Marthas Vineyard for the upcoming bougie-fabulous wedding of Wade and Noah the fellas are put through the paces of addiction; school-boy crushes; cheating hearts; familial homophobia; lectures on AIDS adoption and African babies; and the reappearance of a certain queer British rapper. And thats just for starters. Its a wearying checklist that would be daunting even in the hands of a more talented filmmaker than series creator (and Jumping the Broom director-co-writer) Patrick Ian Polk. While there are some solid chuckles scattered throughout the film Polks heavy-handed political sloganeering is lifted straight from pamphlets while his character development and plotting are clumsy and filled with holes. The ensemble acting is putting it kindly wildly uneven. Worst of all for a project thats always confused designer labels for social awareness and political progress Polk lacks the visual skills to pull us into the films fetishizing of the so-called good life. (Sunset 5) (Ernest Hardy)  PASSENGERS Anne Hathaway has the biggest damn chestnut eyes youve ever seen--I spent a lot of time swimming in them as theyre about the only thing Passengers has going for it. As a young beautifully coiffured psychiatrist Hathaway is assigned to depressurize the lone survivors of a commercial airline crash and finds herself lavishing special after-hours attention on one unusually elated patient (Patrick Wilson considerably overestimating the charm of squinty smugness). As her patients begin to mysteriously disappear the movie shifts into ""What really happened on that plane?"" mode with chills provided by the dreaded David Morse peeking around corners. Though deceptively marketed as a just-in-time-for-All-Hallows-Eve spooktacular this is really a character-centered romance that non-starts on the total lack of traction between Hathaway and Wilson. The biggest shock (aside from seeing how arbitrarily movies are chosen for theatrical release) is provided by an intrusively blown newspaper. The horribly drawn-out unwinding of an Astonishing Twist Ending retrospectively absolves the film of responsibility for ridiculous scene-stagings and narrative gaffes and confirms Passengers as a kind of declawed inside-out Final Destination -- with none of the sense of showmanship and all the looming malice of a mawkish condolence card. (Selected theaters) (Nick Pinkerton)  SAW V For fans of the deathtrap-redemption horror series and its central figure John ""Jigsaw"" Kramer (Tobin Bell) -- and realistically only the die-hards are buying tickets at this point -- theres good news and theres bad news. On the plus side Saw V director David Hackl who conceived most of the elaborate contraptions in prior installments brings an enthusiasm to the table that Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw II-Saw IV) seemed to have lost last time around. He also smartly reverts to the Saw II formula of a co-operative series of traps for a group of five victims that plays like a reality show from hell here interspersed with the search for the late Jigsaws new protege revealed in part IV to be Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor). Unfortunately both Mandylor and Scott Patterson who returns as fellow Saw IV survivor Agent Strahm are uninteresting stiffs; worse still are the flashbacks that retroactively place Hoffman in numerous key scenes from the first three films completely undercutting the relationship between Jigsaw and former protegee Amanda (Shawnee Smith) that was once the heart of the story. The method to the madness of the traps turns out to be quite clever but the rewriting of Saw mythology is the slasher equivalent of revising Star Wars so that Greedo fires at Han Solo first. (Citywide) (Luke Y. Thompson) GO   THE TREE OF LIFE Throbbing with midlife crisis after a brush with cancer Los Angeles-based electronics engineer Hava Volterra journeys to Italy in search of deep background about her late father a physicist. In Israel where she grew up in the ghettos of Venice and in the town of Volterra which gave her family its name she digs up a pretty interesting family tree and a truly fascinating history of Italian-Jewish life from the 15th century through the Holocaust enhanced by interviews with historians in Italy and Israel and some nifty animation and marionette puppetry. One sympathizes with Volterras yearning to find out more about her ""doting"" but remote father yet he remains a shadowy and not altogether likable figure who despite being a devout Communist felt humiliated by his failure to win a Nobel Prize. Trotting out her familys illustrious pedigree as scientists bankers and politicians at every turn Volterra appears to have inherited some of his intellectual snobbery. Fortunately her affinity for Italian stereotypes is countered with delightful truculence by the films most engaging character her down-to-earth octogenarian aunt Viviana who enjoys her work in the kibbutz laundry entertains kids with puppets on the side and wont stand for any bullshit about the romantic essence of the Mediterranean temperament. (Music Hall) (Ella Taylor)  TRU LOVED Writer-director Stewart Wades Tru Loved is a kitschier incarnation of an afterschool special hokey and simplistic but also gawkily sweet-natured. Recently relocated from San Francisco to the suburbs Tru (Najarra Townsend) and family -- composed of her two lesbian mothers and two gay fathers -- are introduced via faux-50s sitcom stylings with the movie temporarily switching from candy-color to black-and-white as cast members trot out to jaunty music. That ironic impulse coexists somewhat uncomfortably with Tru Loveds sincerity. Drawn to the newcomers outsider edge high school quarterback Lodell (Matthew Thompson) strikes up a romance with Tru only to confess to his closeting shortly thereafter. (The film couldve been titled But Im a Football Player.) ""I didnt say Id be your Katie Holmes"" she protests before reluctantly agreeing to provide social cover for Lo by pretending to be his girlfriend. Matters are complicated when Tru spearheads a gay-straight alliance club with openly out Walter (Tye Olson) and starts secretly dating straight dream-boat Trevor (Jake Abel). Fluffiness aside the films multicultural microcosm does have a giddying effect Tru Loved offers a utopian vision of inclusiveness you wish the world would embrace.

It may be as friendly and square as one of those 1950s teen romps in which the actors wore letter sweaters but that doesnt mean the movie is an uptight anachronism. Its shrewd enough to know that in an era ruled by drop-dead irony gee-whiz sincerity can be its own rebellion -- a wholesome rebuke to consumerist cool. The star jocks and theater bugs of East High School in Albuquerque have already been through championship games opening nights and -- in the case of the googly-eyed princess Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) -- enough costume changes to empty Christina Aguileras closet. But as they close in on the end of senior year a question nags Can they be themselves in a culture thats figured out how to market Individuality? In 2006 the first High School Musical was a phenomenon and its not hard to see why. Directed by Kenny Ortega the choreographer of Dirty Dancing it was a delightful paradox a squeaky-clean Disney Channel film that used the image of a multiracial yet homogenized all-American high school to make a case for the importance of not running with the pack. The films lets-put-on-a-show enthusiasm harkened back to the Judy Garland/Mickey Rooney musicals but that spirit was merged with an infectious pop-rock swagger and most refreshingly a can this be real? wink at its own kitschy earnestness. (It turned Disneys theme-park conformity on its mouse ear.) High School Musical was like Beach Blanket Bingo Grease Footloose Rent Hairspray (the John Waters and Broadway versions) and The Brady Bunch all mixed together; even the overbright studio-backlot look had a distinct charm -- it gave Albuquerque the sunbaked expansiveness of exurb America. The whole thing was carried aloft by the teenybop grin sapphire eyes and shimmying hips of Zac Efron who played Troy Bolton the hoops star who secretly longed to sing and dance as a fusion of jock and showman teen idol and Ordinary Dude. You could also say that Troy was both straight and...well you know joyous. Because lets face it Any movie in which a high schools most revered athlete is ambivalent about how much he loves to perform in musicals is saying something about sex roles and tolerance in 21st-century youth culture. If you were a fan of High School Musical where Troy fell for the heart-faced Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) and revealed himself to be a ""Gotta dance"" stage freak or High School Musical 2 (2007) in which Troy and his buddies learned the perils of the class system by working for the summer at a country club you may well ask Whats left for Troy and the gang to conquer? High School Musical 3 stands in relation to the first two films as the Sex and the City movie did to that series Its longer more lavish and a bit less perky. Troy has to decide if hes going to chase a basketball scholarship at the home-state alma mater of his dad (Bart Johnson) or follow his own dream. And how will Gabriella who lands in the Stanford honors program figure in? Can their romance survive the end of high school? I havent even mentioned the senior prom These are standard youth-movie dilemmas but theyre brought to life by the high-energy cast and the musical numbers which Ortega shoots with electrifying pizzazz. When Troy and Gabriella waltz in the rain on the school?s garden rooftop the movie taps that blend of shyness and exhibitionism that animates so many adolescents. Later Troy and Chad (Corbin Bleu) his dreadlocked teammate and best bud do a gymnastic dance in a junkyard flipping and twirling to ""The Boys Are Back"" and its a thriller. Here once again the beauty of Efrons performance is that hes a vibrant athletic hoofer who leaps and clowns with the heartthrob vigor of a young Gene Kelly yet hes also achingly sincere. His fast-break alertness makes him the most empathetic of teen idols; hes like a David Cassidy who knows how to act and who can swoon without getting too moist about it. Apart from Efron the breakout star is Ashley Tisdale whose Sharpay makes narcissism a goofy bedazzled pleasure. I dont want to overpraise the High School Musical films In their happy way they have a synthetic connect-the-dots quality. But its hard to resist the way they take American teen culture back to the future.

Director Kenny Ortega clearly knows it moving the 21-year-old heartthrob center stage in ""High School Musical 3 Senior Year"" the infectiously upbeat bigscreen extension of Disney Channels runaway TV movie sensation. Most likely to succeed in East High Schools class of 2008 is Zac Efron. Director Kenny Ortega clearly knows it moving the 21-year-old heartthrob center stage in ""High School Musical 3 Senior Year"" the infectiously upbeat bigscreen extension of Disney Channels runaway TV movie sensation. By this point in the franchise Efron seems to have outgrown his on-again/off-again love interest leaving screenwriter Peter Barsocchini hard-pressed to cook up a fresh conflict -- not that tween fans need one. Pics bouncy playlist and bigger musical numbers will see theaters packed with the faithful while conveniently introducing a freshman cast to carry the torch in the process. Given the built-in fan base for ""High School Musical"" -- a phenomenon so popular its been performed by hundreds of junior drama departments around the country -- the Disney team didnt have to do much to ensure a massive turnout. And yet Ortega who tackled ""Newsies"" for the studio back in the day seems determined to get it right making excellent use of the wider canvas to stage his most impressive setpieces yet. Sharpays ""I Want It All"" in particular unfurls as an extravagant homage to Broadway -- a far cry from the first film in which the tunes were buried as karaoke duets or theater rehearsals for fear that musical-averse auds wouldnt go for break-out-in-song moments. Starting small Ortega has taught an entirely new generation to love musical theater. However while Ortega and fellow choreographers Charles Klapow and Bonnie Story stretch their imaginations theres something almost lazy about the pics underachiever script. If the first film was like ""West Side Story"" (school basketball star falls for brainy transfer student) and the second was like ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" (the boy must now decide between the rich girl who offers him everything and the common one who captured his heart) ""Senior Year"" lacks a fresh central dilemma. Pic begins with the Wildcats winning their second basketball championship. Gabriella (Hudgens) is headed for Stanford while Troy (Efron) has a basketball scholarship to the local university where his best friend Chad (Corbin Bleu) and his father (Bart Johnson) expect him to go. So with graduation on the horizon things are bittersweet between the couple with Gabriella pulling away to avoid further heartbreak. To complicate matters drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) has invited recruiters from Juilliard to observe the senior year musical and award one student a scholarship. Troys in the running but seems largely undecided about his future which is one reason the movies ""I want"" song traditionally reserved for the protagonist in musicals goes to attention hog Sharpay (Ashley Tisdale) instead. Wowing Juilliard figures prominently in her own plans even if it means trampling twin brother Ryan (Lucas Grabeel still the most talented of the bunch) and her new transfer-student groupie Tiara (Jemma McKenzie-Brown) in the process. Of course the most pressing anxiety for ""High School Musical 3"" fans concerns where the cast goes from here. While two new basketball players emerge in Efrons shadow (played by goofy-to-the-point-of-annoying Matt Prokop and pint-sized sidekick Justin Martin) neither seems particularly well-suited to fill his shoes. By contrast theres plenty of gold in the Sharpay-Tiara dynamic which yields a hilarious fight for the spotlight. As in the earlier films Ortega employs a wide variety of musical genres ranging from teen-angst rock anthem ""Scream"" to the boy-band-styled ""The Boys Are Back"" adapting the styles to the participating characters states of mind at that moment. Latter number yields the pics most original choreography as Troy and Chad reconnect with their inner children in a salvage yard full of great dance props a reminder of the teams gift for organically creating playful dance moves from nearly any situation. By releasing the songs in advance Disney may have found an answer to their mostly forgettable quality After listening to them enough on their MP3 players young auds may think of them as standards. But its the staging not the music (which has a disembodied studio sound and never quite synchs with the characters) that makes ""High School Musical 3"" worthy of the bigscreen -- though the Efron factor doesnt hurt.
