ENLARGE Photo Derek Wiesehahn By Dorothy Rabinowitz Dorothy Rabinowitz The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyDorothy Rabinowitz Dorothy.Rabinowitzwsj.com June 16 2016 519 p.m. ET 10 COMMENTS Trapped Monday 10 p.m PBS More Reviews Thirteen The title ""Trapped"" refers in its own bitterly ironic way to the continuing practice of Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers an all-too-coldly clinical description for the increasing number of state regulations--hundreds--that have led over the past few years to an extreme reduction in access to abortion mostly in Southern states. Dawn Porters Independent Lens documentary goes to the battle lines of the war being waged now in defense of their survival by the remaining few clinics in Alabama and Texas--waged officially by the legal team arguing in a case about to be decided by the Supreme Court that the right to abortion under Roe v. Wade has been unduly infringed upon. Specifically the case argues that the hundreds of new laws requiring expensive new physical modifications and various improvements having little or nothing to do with safe pregnancy termination were intended for the sole purpose of closing clinics and thus circumventing womens access to abortion. The legislatures passing these laws insist that they acted solely to make abortions safer. Still the film shows at least one legislator from Mississippi--which has one remaining clinic--smiling as he declares that if the new clinic legislation makes abortion just a little bit harder to come by thats a good bill. One staff member of a clinic notes that some of the new legislation requires full operating rooms of the kind normally required for open-heart surgery. The films most compelling argument emerges from interviews with women who now struggle to find abortion services largely poor women whove had to travel long distances--trips they could scarcely afford--to find a clinic that was open. Most of them a commentator notes already have children and know well what it takes to provide for them. One such mother of two children--one of them her much-loved autistic child--declares that she simply cant have another child and shes at peace with her decision. Whether or not the new often impossible to fulfill requirements for abortion facilities are as legislators claim only intended for the health and safety of women the facts remain and the filmmakers make the most of them--prime among them the truth that over half the clinics that existed in 2013 in the states in question have since closed. The Supreme Court decision on the constitutionality of the new state laws governing abortion providers is expected this month. 166 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

Photo Courtesy Of Chris Hilleke Trapped details struggle for abortion clinics to survive 1 / 2 Back to Gallery On March 9 Indiana passed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the United States complicated legislation that among other things would restrict abortions based on a womans reasons for wanting one and could open doctors to wrongful-death lawsuits. But Indiana as San Francisco filmmaker Dawn Porter points out in her documentary ""Trapped"" is just one of some two dozen states with harshly restrictive abortion laws that have despite the clear message from the Supreme Courts Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973 made abortion essentially illegal in half the country. Set mostly in ground zero Southern states such as Alabama and Texas ""Trapped"" won the Special Jury Award for Social Impact Filmmaking at the Sundance Film Festival in January. Its focus is on TRAP laws (targeted regulation of abortion providers) which state legislatures have tailored in their own ways from a legislative template advocated by the influential antiabortion group Americans United for Life. ""Im required by law to tell you that by having an abortion you can increase your risk for breast cancer even though theres no scientific evidence to support that"" says Dr. Willie J. Parker in a talk with a woman who is at his Alabama clinic to have an abortion. He then lists several health risks of an abortion from hemorrhaging to complications that could lead to uterus removal that by the way are exactly the same risks of giving birth. But thats not all. TRAP laws include requirements that doctors have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic restrictions on drug dosage and various requirements of patients that can mandate up to four visits to the clinic. ""These rules we know dont add anything to the safety of women"" Parker says. The net result of these bills is that clinics are being forced to close at an increasing rate. Alabama for example had six abortion clinics at the time of the films making down from 44. Porters film is undeniably skewed to the pro-choice position although she does interview antiabortion advocates as they protest. But mostly ""Trapped"" is a portrait of the indefatigable efforts by doctors and clinic workers to stay open and it delves into reasons women would want abortions (many are already mothers and as working-class people know how hard and expensive it is to raise the children they have). A challenge to Texas controversial HB2 bill which the film notes has forced the closure of several clinics there and might force patients to travel 500 miles for an abortion is expected to be heard by the Supreme Court in June -- probably in front of eight justices instead of nine. As Porter points out the battle on both sides of this contentious issue has only intensified in the nearly half century since Roe vs. Wade. Allen Johnson is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Comments (1) Trapped Video Rated NR  81 minutes  2016 Directed by Dawn Porter this documentary looks at a new front in the antiabortion battle state legislation that targets womens health clinics with prohibitive regulation. Clinic owners in Texas and Alabama explain how so-called TRAP laws (Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) mandate stricter inspections require any abortion doctor to have admitting privileges at a hospital forbid operation of a clinic within 2000 feet of a school and more. ""You never get a break"" says one clinic owner in Huntsville Alabama. ""Youre going from one battle to the next."" Needless to say this has drastically reduced the number of facilities available to women and clinicians share stories of teenage rape victims being turned away because there arent enough doctors available. The rank hypocrisy of conservatives using government regulation to shut down independent businesses is topped only by the white pro-life activist outside one clinic who shouts at an African-American doctor ""Black lives matter"" By J.R.

Credit RoCo Films/Abramorama via Film Sprout With the Supreme Courts hearing of a challenge to a 2013 Texas law imposing stringent requirements on abortion providers comes Dawn Porters ""Trapped"" the winner of the Sundance Film Festivals Special Jury Award for Social Impact Filmmaking and an urgent vital examination of Southern abortion clinics. The films subjects face so-called TRAP laws (the letters stand for targeted regulation of abortion providers) whose critics say aim to close clinics or reduce their number by placing unaffordable or unfeasible demands on them.We are reminded of Roe v. Wades hard-won decision and glimpse the 11-hour filibuster by State Senator Wendy Davis of Texas a Democrat against restrictive abortion legislation in 2013. And we meet other abortion rights advocates like June Ayers owner of Reproductive Health Services in Montgomery Ala. who blends graciousness and fortitude while contending with protesters outside her office. Amy Hagstrom Miller the chief executive of the clinic chain Whole Womans Health which is the plaintiff in the Supreme Court case cites the plummeting number of Texas clinics after the 2013 law was passed and the long distances many patients must now travel for treatment. Gloria Gray of the West Alabama Womens Center in Tuscaloosa invokes a familiar refrain ""Closing the clinics is not going to stop abortions. Women are going to have abortions; its just that they are not going to be safe and legal.""Dr. Willie J. Parker a churchgoing obstetrician and gynecologist who provides abortions is heckled by an anti-abortion campaigner en route to his job. Doctors he says ""have been killed doing this work"" but he adds ""when you have a sense of duty about what you do it allows you to ignore the naysayers.""""Trapped"" is not a balanced analysis of the abortion debate; it makes its sympathies clear. But it is a powerful and persuasive rendering of a corner of womens health care under siege.

(Chris Hilleke/Abramorama) ""Trapped"" Dawn Porters sobering gracefully constructed documentary about the tide of laws restricting abortion that have swept the country couldnt arrive at a more timely moment. Just this week the Supreme Court heard arguments in a potentially historic case involving a dramatically proscriptive statute passed in Texas. The death last month of Justice Antonin Scalia which reduced the court to eight judges makes the ultimate decision all the more consequential In the event of a tie vote the existing statute would remain in place. For viewers interested in the legal and ethical principles at play ""Trapped"" provides an intimate deeply felt primer. The title of the film derives from so-called TRAP laws (for ""targeted regulation of abortion providers"") hundreds of which have been passed over the past six years especially in the South. Following clinics in Mississippi Alabama and Texas where abortion providers are required to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and where clinics must provide ambulatory surgical services the film looks behind the curbside protests and legislative fights to examine the effect of these laws on the daily lives of medical professionals and their patients. The resulting portrait is one of beleaguered but steely determination and occasional confusion as clinic administrators try to parse arcane and contradictory legal language. Their tone softens considerably when they must tell a potential patient that there is either no doctor available that week or that shell have to set aside two or three days while she sits out the required waiting period. ""Trapped"" makes no pretense of balance. This is an abortion-rights advocacy film whose thesis echoes the argument offered this week at the Supreme Court that laws like the ones in Alabama and Texas -- several other states have adopted similar measures -- impose an undue burden on clinics thereby vitiating the right to a safe legal abortion. (Amy Hagstrom Miller founder of Whole Womans Health the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court case is interviewed in the film.) Porter who previously directed ""Gideons Army"" about public defenders is both direct and discreet in filming a subject that doesnt readily lend itself to expressive visual language. Most of the clinics clientele are photographed only at ankle level the camera occasionally glimpsing clasped or resting hands. The protagonists of ""Trapped"" are the clinic directors and doctors who have come to see reproductive health less as a profession than a calling. The most fascinating figure is physician Willie Parker whose practice is animated by his Christian ethics and who can be seen moving his practice from Illinois in order to attend underserved patients in Mississippi Alabama and Georgia. Like ""After Tiller"" a few years ago ""Trapped"" is lucid and illuminating about the issue of abortion as a constitutional right. But in addition to being instructive it brims with compassion leaving viewers with haunting images of women we never even got to see in the first place. At one point a 13-year-old rape victim is told that she wont be able to get an abortion in her state meaning she would have to get the time money family support and resources together to travel thousands of miles. As the clinic worker says shes basically been ""sentenced to motherhood."" Porter leaves viewers with the haunting question of what happened to that girl where she is now and what we did to get her there. Unrated. At Landmarks E Street Cinema.

Share Tweet When Dawn Porters documentary Trapped premiered at Sundance earlier this year four of the movies subjects were there for the post-screening Qamp;A which is fairly common for docs debuting at major film festivals. Less common? The secrecy that surrounded their participation. The three women and one man at that screening all work at womens health clinics that provide abortions. And so for their own safety their trip to Park City was kept quiet. One of Trappeds aims is to explain why thats so chilling.The film covers a familiar story ripped from the headlines. Its about the escalating fight against abortion which has seen clinics beset by protestors--and the occasional terrorist--over the past few decades. Trappeds twist on the topic is suggested by its title. The documentary focuses on the rise in targeted regulations of abortion providers (or TRAP laws) in the conservative legislatures of t states like Alabama Mississippi and Texas. Because the decision to terminate a pregnancy remains a legal right in the United States affirmed by the Supreme Courts Roe V. Wade decision pro-life/anti-choice activists have been skirting the courts by working to make the process incredibly inconvenient and expensive. Theyve moved the hassling of doctors nurses and patients from the sidewalks outside the clinics to inside via byzantine regulations.Fans of HBOs Last Week Tonight may already be familiar with Trapped since the shows recent segment on TRAP laws featured several excerpts from the film using Porters interviews with doctors and nurses to illustrate the absurdity and inhumanity of some of the new legislation. But Trappeds talking-head segments arent really its strongest. Theyre necessary because people like Dr. Willie Parker and clinic director Marva Sadler can concisely identify and condemn the policies that sometimes have them turning away impoverished teenage victims of sexual abuse. But the heavy reliance on interviews--even as moving as many of these are--at times makes the movie feel like a presentation at a NARAL conference.It doesnt help that Trapped is so diffuse and so loosely structured. Porter follows a small handful of medical professionals across the South and simultaneously tracks a few stories very important to them regarding the progress of court challenges to the TRAP laws and whether those laws will force more clinics to close. But because Trapped keeps bouncing back and forth among these mini-narratives--intercut with more interviews and ""day in the life"" footage--nothing really emerges as the documentarys primary arc. As a result the movie ends abruptly with the news of one case entering a possibly promising new phase followed by a more general update and call to action.That said theres real power in the more unobtrusive scenes of Parker Sadler and the rest going about their ordinary business ignoring protestors and treating patients. Porter has made a few documentaries set in the South and has a feel for the complexities of Southern culture--evident in the shots of nurses praying with patients and the introduction of a brassy Southern dame who hands out bumper stickers that read ""I Hope Your Fetus Grows Up To Be A Gay Abortion Doctor."" At its best Trapped removes the controversy over abortion rights from the realm of the theoretical by spending time with the people the TRAP laws disproportionately affect the very young the working poor and mothers who cant afford to have any more children.And while the movie doesnt give much time to the protestors and politicians Porter does attempt to expose some of their current tactics--like how theyve started shouting ""Black Lives Matter"" at young black women seeking abortions and how they justify unnecessary medical equipment and procedures under the guise of ""protecting women."" At one point Trapped drops in at a rally for conservative Christian Alabama judge Roy Moore and lingers over a supporters T-shirt that sports a checklist reading ""Abortion Is... Murder; Islam Is... A Lie; Evolution Is... A Delusion; Homosexuality Is... A Sin"" and so on. Trapped is hit-and-miss as a piece of filmmaking but effective as an argument contending not only that some Americans rights are being systematically taken away but that when only a handful of organizations stand up for those rights they become a bigger target.

Photo Chris Hilleke MOVIE REVIEW Trapped Running time 80 minutes. Not rated (nothing offensive). Score one for timely release dates This documentary on restrictive abortion laws comes out two days after the Supreme Court hears a Texas-based case about them. The so-called TRAP laws -- ""targeted regulation of abortion providers"" -- have drastically winnowed down the number of abortion clinics across the country since state legislatures began passing them in 2010. This informative no-frills and decidedly opinionated film from director Dawn Porter (""Spies of Mississippi"") depicts the consequences of those laws focusing on clinics in Alabama and Texas struggling to keep up with regulations designed to shut them down -- and a heavy influx of desperate women whose nearby clinics are already closed. Scary and sad ""Trapped"" is for anyone who cares about the precarious future of reproductive health for American women.

In ""Trapped"" lawyer-turned-documentarian Dawn Porter (""Gideons Army"") chronicles the lives of medical professionals who work at clinics subject to so-called TRAP laws. The acronym stands for ""targeted regulations of abortion providers"" statutes that opponents say limit access to abortion in the guise of promoting safe health practices. Not as powerful as ""After Tiller"" or as visually distinguished as ""Lake of Fire"" Porters advocacy doc settles for a straightforward somewhat standard presentation laying out a forceful argument that these laws though designed to sound innocuous pose significant burdens to clinics doctors and patients. The movie is scheduled to open on March 4 two days after the Supreme Court hears a major case on Texass current abortion regulations. A ruling is expected in June; the Sundance cut could well require an update by the time the film airs on Independent Lens that month. Like ""After Tiller"" which focused on doctors who perform late-term abortions ""Trapped"" is not a sweeping look at the abortion debate but a closely observed portrait of a particular segment of it. Porter zeros in on clinics in Alabama Mississippi and Texas that -- particularly since 2010 according to the movies timeline -- have faced a proliferation of regulations that have had the effect of restricting their operations. In many cases were told these laws have pushed clinics to shut down. We watch as a Tuscaloosa Ala. clinic facing closure directs callers to Huntsville and Montgomery. Marva Sadler director of clinical services for Whole Womans Health in Texas runs through the costs of buying what appear to be unnecessary medications and replacing them when they expire. Willie Parker an obstetrician-gynecologist who used to travel from Chicago to states where doctors who perform abortions are difficult to find (and who eventually relocated to the South) describes the catch-22 that often comes with requiring that physicians have admitting privileges at a local hospital. Because the privileges often require a certain number of admissions and abortion is regarded as a relatively safe procedure he explains he wouldnt be able to admit enough patients to keep the privileges. At times the daily operations seem to verge on the absurd. (""Im required to tell you that theres a risk of breast cancer"" Parker tells a patient at the sole abortion clinic that remains in Mississippi. ""There is no scientific evidence to support that."") June Ayers owner and director of Reproductive Health Services in Montgomery makes creative use of a sprinkler system to ward off protesters. Toward the films end staffers at a San Antonio clinic wait out the clock on June 29 2015 wondering whether the Supreme Court will grant a stay that will keep their office open and their jobs in place. Unapologetically one-sided ""Trapped"" is not a movie that is going to change anybodys mind about abortion. Rather the emphasis is on illustrating how abstract political debates lead to tangible consequences in the lives of both patients and healthcare professionals. Some patients are shown; at least one is obscured. At one point were told a clinic has been forced to turn away a 13-year-old rape victim who made a four-hour trip to be there. Powerful material doesnt automatically yield a timeless or artistic documentary and for better or worse ""Trapped"" is an op-ed aimed squarely at the present moment in an enduring national conversation. It could stand to take a longer view and check in on its subjects a year from now. Pics tech credits are purely functional.

Lorie Lucky says March 19 2016 at 944 am I dont think that this review of ""Trapped"" is particularly fair. Ive been a volunteer helping low-income women get abortions in Washington State since 1994. This is the most honest movie I could have ever hoped to have seen about the state of abortion in the United States (where it remains a LEGAL procedure. With the clinic closures we have women flying here from Idaho Oregon Nebraska Alaska and eastern Washington to have sponsored abortions in Seattle if they are low-income women. These are desperate women - more Americans need to see this film. And do you realize how much danger the providers in this movie are in now? Dr. Willie Parker bless him has become even more a marked man. He must be the bravest man in America for standing up for womens rights.
