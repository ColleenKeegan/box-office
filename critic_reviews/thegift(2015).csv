Entertainment ""The Gift"" Reinvents An Old-Fashioned Kind Of Fragile Heroine The psychological thriller cleverly updates a classic kind of vulnerable horror character. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall in The Gift. Matt Kennedy / STX Productions ID 6547426 The Gift is a movie about two people who havent managed to get past what happened in high school.Its a concept thats more often the basis of arrested development comedies about late bloomers who finally come into their own but theres nothing funny about how the past looms over the adults that Gordo (Australian actor Joel Edgerton who also wrote the screenplay making his directorial debut) and Simon (Jason Bateman) have become. The teenage cruelties they endured or inflicted upon others have shaped them in ways that are immediately obvious in Gordo awkward in his outdated earring badly dyed hair and lack of personal boundaries leaving overly thoughtful presents and dropping by for unscheduled visits; the teen outsider he used to be is visible in the grown man. Its less clear with Simon a student body president turned startup exec who seems to have it all together until a run-in with Gordo starts fracturing his chipper persona and the nastier character he used to be (and maybe still is) starts showing through.Its no wonder that the film filters its story through Simons wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) whos the most reasonable person onscreen. View this image > Joel Edgerton Matt Kennedy / STX Productions ID 6547433 But shes also a clever update of an old-fashioned type of heroine who hasnt moved easily into the present day for obvious reasons. Robyn is a Victorian hysteric in running shoes a contemporary version of a character who goes back to The Yellow Wallpaper and on through Rosemarys Baby. She spends her days alone with the dog in the mid-century California house into which she and Simon recently moved a beautiful place whose floor-to-ceiling windows also give it the unsettling look of a display case in which shes the object to be examined. And when she starts to feel unsafe there by herself like maybe the place isnt all that secure Simon tells her shes being silly -- even though he knows more than hes told her about his old high school classmate.Robyn is right to feel frightened -- The Gift is a thriller though enough of a slow burn that you wouldnt count on warming your hands over it. Unfolding in parallel to Robyns experiences are growing tensions over unresolved history between Simon and Gordo who she sees as nice and a little lonely despite her husbands scorn. But like the fictional women whove preceded her Robyn accepts the reality on which her spouse insists over the one shes actually experiencing ceding to his explanations despite her growing anxiety. Past characters like this have been products of their era subject to each periods patriarchal expectations treated as fragile and infantilized -- the 2010 remake of the 70s TV movie Dont Be Afraid of the Dark actually changed its main character from wife to little girl to explain why no one would take her fears seriously. View this image > Matt Kennedy / STX Productions ID 6547441 Robyn isnt a little girl and shes not a fool but shes living in a new state dealing with a miscarriage and coming off of a pill problem. She has insomnia and is susceptible to panic attacks. She has reasons to feel vulnerable and to want to lean on the man she married though as the movie goes on we trust him less and less. And most pointedly she relates more to Gordos experiences than to Simons having grown up unpopular and harassed herself now holding on to stable adulthood with shaky hands.The movie ends with a development thats a little too discordant with everything thats come before it and with the slow shift of sympathy back and forth between the two men. But the scariest thing it has to offer is the idea that Robyns been just as unable to get away from those formative experiences as the other characters in their cold war even though she doesnt think of them -- theyre still guiding the relationships shes chosen and the lack of confidence shes had in herself. There are many ways to be bullied and sometimes they come from someone assuring you everything hes done has been for your own good.

The wrapping paper was identical to that of a similar-sized box of goodies found resting on every reclining seat at the AMC La Jolla before the press screening of The Gift. Besides the studio rep tipped me to its pending arrival. The news of its journey came a few hours after my interview with the films writer director and star Joel Edgerton. Our chat must have been a success. Why else would a same-day shipment of swag be in order? The Gift chillingly illustrates what happens when fate reunites a class bully (Jason Bateman) with his prize victim Gordo (Edgerton). A red hand-written card taped to the package read ""Scott -- Its been a while...we should catch up soon. YourFriendGordo"" punctuated by the characters trademark smiley face. Alright. You have me going. Unlike the screening spoils -- three squares of dark Ghirardelli chocolate -- the first name to appear while ridding the container of its wrapping was that of Warner Bros. animation guru Chuck Jones. Inside was a scale replica Acme Anvil identical to those drawn by both Joness pen and the gravitational pull of Wile E. Coyotes head. For the man who has everything Was this an attempt at finding a corollary between a first-rate psychological thriller and the delightfully inappropriate antics of a Road Runner cartoon? And why would indie production company STX Entertainment be sending me something associated with a rival studio? None of it made sense so to help confound matters more I turned to Fox 5s Josh Board my row-mate at the screening hoping that he could admit me chorus to this anvil mystery. A long pause followed by Boards quizzical ""Anvil? What anvil?"" led to my downing a couple of Advil. ""I give up"" began the email to Cindy Falco the publicist. ""Loved the card but what does a (cartoon) anvil have to do with The Gift?"" Video The Gift trailer ""We just wanted it to be something personalized to you"" came the speedy reply. ""As if Gordo has known you for a while... So I was talking to Matthew and he mentioned you liked Looney Tunes. I figured it would be a great personalized gift on behalf of Gordo."" You mean this wasnt a tschotske occupying space in the Allied Integrated Marketing prize closet waiting in patient preparation for just such a situation to arise? Surely the studio shipped a half-dozen or so in advance to tickle the bellies of responsive critics. And since when does anyone in the industry put time thought and originality into individualizing a camera movement let alone a gift? The thought does count Ms. PR rep. Kudos for your puzzlingly idiosyncratic display of thanks. And to you Lickona should the question ever again be posed would you please inform the querier of my fondness for hundred-dollar bills?

"Small(er) Movie Roundup A Pair of Movies More Fantastic Than You-Know-Who << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Small(er) Movie Roundup A Pair of Movies More Fantastic Than You-Know-Who Sony Pictures Classics Movies August 11 2015 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print The Diary of a Teenage Girl directed by Marielle Heller Theres a lot about this movie thats stock-familiar. Its set in San Francisco in the 1970s (76 to be precise) and the protagonist -- an aspiring artist named Minnie (Bel Powley) -- has lost her virginity by the first scene and will spend a lot of the movie chasing a boy. Her mother (Kristen Wiig) is one of those anything-goes types -- single and sensual and druggy and off. Except here are Minnies first words to us courtesy of the audio diary shes just started keeping ""I just had sex. Holy. Shit."" And the mother Charlotte isnt so high that shes a terrible mother shes just permissive and absent enough to miss for a long while that the guy Minnie is chasing is Charlottes adult boyfriend Monroe (Alexander Skarsgard) who appears to have fallen in love with her daughter. This is not a Lifetime movie. Its a comedy -- based on Phoebe Gloeckners graphic novel -- and Heller gets far inside Minnies psyche. Youre watching a girl figure sex out (Monroes not the only man she conquers) but without any of the moralizing judgment thats typical of these films. It begins as a movie about sex and the way it can empower girls. But Heller picks up on the strength of Gloeckners book and weds Minnies sexuality with her obsession with art namely the oleaginous grotesquerie of Aline Kominsky-Crumbs underground comics. Aline always seemed like Lee Krasner to her husband Roberts Jackson Pollock. But Heller and Gloeckner reassert Aline as a crucial landmark. The animated flowers and cute stuff that early on dance around Minnie in her bedroom eventually become poignant cartoons in which Minnie is a giantess. But its not fear that brings her to Aline. Its sexual liberation. Its recognition of herself in the drawings off-kilter power. A lot of whats initially funny comes from Powley whos a Brit in her early twenties. These sexual-awakening parts tend to suck the life out of actresses. Its like theyre steeling themselves for eroticism -- and you see the results and cant blame them. But Hellers empathy and lets be honest her denial of prurience appears to free Powley from embarrassment. Shes seizing this part not shrinking from it. Her face and eyes have appealing roundness. She looks like a cartoon of determination. Her voice has the breathy authority to give a 70s-era line like ""Because he knows how it goes and I dont"" as much go-with-the-flow wisdom as an adolescent can have. But eventually Powley also has to put across the complicated womanly stuff born of emotional intelligence -- and she does. Theres a great moment in which something clicks in Minnie that changes her perception of the affair and Powley gives it the sophisticated split-level awareness of a girl having an adult epiphany. By the end shes doing the carnival strength test swinging too hard for the pin to ding the bell. Theres a dark detour into drugs (and worse) that the movie feels only partially sure of. But this is Hellers first film and shes a real director if not of space then of people situations and mood. Wiig and Skarsgard do deep layered stuff with foolish characters that keeps you from laughing at them. Its as if Heller said play the era but without making caricatures. Its the little things about this movie that got me like when in a lustful fit Minnie and her best friend (Madeleine Waters) lick the crotch of an Iggy Pop poster. Later Minnie and a friend service two strangers by pretending to be prostitutes. This is during the movies uncertain dark phase but Heller includes a shot of the girls clasping hands. That feels certain. This is what happens I think when women reexamine an era. This film feels of a piece with the recent quiet reappraisal of adolescent girls and their treatment by older men. The critic Karina Longworth devoted a string of episodes of her Hollywood-history podcast You Must Remember This to the women of the Manson murders and Jason Cherkis reported extensively on the Runaways ravaging by the manager and human dorsal fin Kim Fowley. Even something like the botched second season of True Detective suggests somethings in the air. Normally American movies about girls and sex tend to be cautionary. You have to leave the country to witness sexuality that matures a woman as opposed to wrecks her. (Lucrecia Martels The Holy Girl from Argentina is a superior cousin to Hellers movie.) But maybe theres something in the explicitness of the graphic novel that makes it land better over here. Alison Bechdels graphic-novel memoir Fun Home turned into a Broadway musical that was foremost about a girl coming into her lesbianism. Theyre ultimately both positive about sex illustrations of sexuality on the one hand but instructive blueprints on the other. STX Entertainment The Gift directed by Joel Edgerton Finally someone who gets that Jason Batemans best mode is as an asshole; he never even bothers to put it beneath the surface of most of his acting. For Bad Words his first time out as a director he cast himself as an adult who hijacks the National Spelling Bee by participating in it. Its the most obnoxious movie Ive seen in five years. This is to say that Bateman doesnt care about modulation. He likes this smug douche-y persona hes made for himself. And now the Australian actor Edgerton has built a good psychological thriller around it. Edgerton wrote this movie too and has cast himself as an American creep who wont stop badgering Batemans corporate suit Simon and Robyn Simons nervous wife (Rebecca Hall). The ""why"" is worth waiting for. The creep -- hes got a Walter White goatee and everybody calls him Gordo -- went to high school with Simon and happens to run into the couple in a store not long after theyve relocated to Southern California from Chicago for ""a new start."" She was stressed had a miscarriage then suffered shaky mental health. Simons kind of put off by this guy. But Robyn thinks his leaving presents on their doorstep and random drop-ins are nice. His awkwardness appeals to hers. Thats a wonderful touch that the movie doesnt overdo. Hall is the sort of actor who can make that kind of identification resonate. They spend time talking about Gordo to friends (Allison Tolman Adam Lazarre-White Tim Griffin and Busy Philipps) who hear hes invited them to dinner and more or less say Dont go in there. Needless to say They go. And something strange happens. Then something else. Then the dog goes missing. Then Robyn starts digging around in the past. Officially this is a blank-from-hell movie. But Edgerton has remixed the formula. Its unclear what category the blank is or whos occupying it. Not metaphysically but character-wise. Gordo wants to talk about the past and Simon has no idea what Gordo means. And because the first two-thirds are told from Robyns point of view youre as intrigued by these two as she is. When the movie shifts to Simons it feels like a narrative contrivance. And yet the shift lets the film get into its ideas about moral reparation and bygones and evading the past. No matter how insinuating criminally evasive and sociopathic Gordo is Simon seems worse. But he doesnt care. Hes proud of his what a dick he is. The character somehow manages to scratch an itch you might have for Trump-level disses and tirades. He can justify any offense. These are designed to send Gordo further over the edge. Simon speaks the language of any person who presumes himself to be entitled to do anything and have everything. What Edgerton does with that entitlement is apply uncannily satisfying restraint. His simple blank-from-hell movie culminates in what feels like allegory (thats the only way most of the behavior here makes sense). Everything is up for grabs not just whos the blank -- but what under these circumstances is a fitting definition of ""hell.""

It never flinches from that path either. Where other films would have opted for cheap thrills The Gift remains focused on the phantoms within. For most of its running time its villains arent people but doubt fear guilt and rage. Its that rarest of psychological thrillers one that actually lives up to the words psychological thriller. The couple in question Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) have moved to the Los Angeles area after some time in Chicago because hes just gotten a fancy new job. They seem loving but haunted. She we learn is somewhat emotionally fragile possibly due to a miscarriage she had back in Chicago. He meanwhile is a loving affable cutthroat -- a guy whose laid-back demeanor hides deep reserves of paranoia and ambition both at home and at work. The plot swings into motion when the couple runs into Gordon (Edgerton himself) an old high-school acquaintance of Simons. ""Gordo"" whom Simon informs us was once known as ""Gordo the Weirdo"" acts aggressively nice toward them and particularly Robyn -- bringing by gifts of wine and lists of local handymen and even filling their empty koi pond with real fish. Simon and Robyn are both freaked out by such ""asymmetric friendship"" (as one chatty guest at one of their bourgeois dinner parties describes it). But already seams are starting to show in husband and wifes differing approaches Simon who was never close to Gordo in the first place is deeply troubled by the mans actions; Robyn meanwhile is certainly uncomfortable but she sees something of herself in Gordos neediness. Theres always been a certain complacency to Jason Batemans generally amiable presence -- even at his most likable he seems pleasantly cocooned in his own self-regard. The Gift plays wonderfully with that showing us how it takes the minutest of shifts for the actor to go from genial everyman to smug patronizing jerk. Hall meanwhile has got this exposed-nerve thing down cold; shes never seemed more vulnerable and thats saying a lot. Watching their relationship mutate as these two actors toy with their respective personae is one of The Gifts many pleasures. But the real star of this show is Edgerton. First theres his performance In others films he often vanishes off the screen and not always in a good way. Here he puts that blankness to good use -- Gordo is for much of the film thoroughly unreadable his character determined as much by the changing dynamics of Simon and Robyns marriage as by anything the actor himself does. Second and most important This is an exceedingly well-written and directed film. As a screenwriter Edgerton clearly has an eye and ear for small revealing details even manners of speech that hint at characters true intentions. And he rarely goes for the easy way out. Its rare for one of these types of movies -- lets call it the Creepy Friend or Neighbor genre with examples ranging from Pacific Heights to Fatal Attraction to well The Cable Guy -- to keep this level of suspense and uncertainty going for this long. Usually we figure out everybodys true nature by a certain point and the films just degenerate into chase scenes or violent set pieces. The Gift instead maintains its aura of nerve-racking tension throughout keeping us guessing not just as to what will happen next but as to who at heart all these people really are. The film certainly has its share of real frights -- including a couple of terrific jump scares -- but its real terrors are in the mind.

Not because of who they were or are now but maybe because of something you did to them way back when you were kids and supposedly didnt know any better. Well Aussie actor Joel Edgerton (Animal Kingdom The Great Gatsby) who has penned a half-dozen films takes that squirm-inducing premise and turns it into a whole movie -- the super-creepy psychological thriller The Gift. In fact Edgerton not only wrote the movie but makes an impressive directorial debut with the ripe-for-discussion subject matter of bullying and its after-effects. He also plays the role of Gordo ""The Weirdo"" -- sporting a bad haircut goatee and single earring -- who has a chance encounter with an old classmate the much more successful Simon (a perfectly cast Jason Bateman at his overconfident and manipulative best) and his wife Robyn (British actress Rebecca Hall as the films moral centre). We discover that the well-heeled pair have moved back to Los Angeles into a dream home for Simons new security job. After the trio meet in a furniture store Gordon starts inappropriately showing up with gifts at the couples nifty-looking mid-century modern house complete with a koi pond; and then dropping by unexpectedly mainly to see Robyn whos a wounded soul with a bigger heart than her seemingly smooth-talking husband. But as the story progresses the viewer will repeatedly switch allegiances between the two men as questions are raised. Was there in fact an incident? Just how bad was it? Do both parties involved have wildly different memories of what went down? Does acknowledgement and forgiveness actually ""make bygones be bygones?"" And most importantly for Robyn just how well does she actually know her husband Simon? Edgertons twisty-turny script peppered with lots of tension dread and suspense keeps you guessing right until the very end and his portrayal of Gordo resonates with the audience. Gordo is someone weve all gone to school with and perhaps didnt treat as well as we should have. Thats the key to the story. Its what makes it relatable to us all no matter how well-behaved we were as children. Edgerton also chose the right location -- the glass-walled home in the hills of Sherman Oaks Calif. -- producing just the right amount of vulnerability for Robyn an interior designer who is often left at home alone while Simon goes off to work each day.

Director Joel Edgerton (146). R language. Lincoln Square Union Square area theaters. Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) have just moved from Chicago to a stylish Southern California home. Hes starting a new job. Shes still recovering from a miscarriage that sent her into a self-medicated depression. They run into Simons high school classmate Gordo (Joel Edgerton) whos just a little too eager to reconnect. Its not long before hes appearing in the window for midday drop-ins and leaving weird gifts at their front door. Cue the ""Psycho""-esque ree-ree-ree string-heavy score -- its going to be a jumpy night. From left Joel Edgerton Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall in ""The Gift."" (Matt Kennedy) Look its not like Australian actor Edgerton (""The Great Gatsby"" the upcoming ""Black Mass"") who also wrote and directed hasnt created a tense atmosphere of looming menace. He has. And its not like I didnt startle when I was supposed to. I did. Its just that in an era where TV episodes get parsed within an inch of their plots the paint-by-numbers tension here is not enough. Rebecca Hall stars in ""The Gift."" (Matt Kennedy) Edgerton seems to have pulled ""The Gift"" right out of a time capsule from 1992. Evidently it was tucked in next to classic psycho-thrillers like ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" ""Single White Female"" and ""Basic Instinct."" Edgertons sole attempt at an update is invoking a modern-day boogeyman -- the bully. Its fun to see Bateman channel his inner prick. But the gaslighting husband/cruel high school tormentor subplot is so underwritten that it feels tacked on.

This is the question that ""The Gift"" tries to answer. Joking aside -- though Jason Batemans performance really does drift towards his iconic ""Arrested Development"" character -- ""The Gift"" is one hell of a throwback thriller. Perfectly tightly packaged much like the presents that mysteriously arrive on the doorstep ""The Gift"" is a classic suspenseful psychological drama that harkens back to an older Hollywood (like the 1990s). Those gifts start to arrive at the new home of Robyn (Rebecca Hall) and Simon (Bateman) who have relocated to start a new life -- new job new attempt at a family. After running into old school chum Gordo (Joel Edgerton) in a store he begins to insinuate himself into their lives one meticulously wrapped package at a time. Simon is instantly suspicious while Robyn sympathetic to his social awkwardness is far more welcoming and forgiving and rationalizes their fears of his stalking over and over. As their interactions with Gordo persist Simon reveals himself more and more to be a controlling bully a trait that has followed him since childhood and which colors his history with Gordo. Writer/director Joel Edgerton has done the impossible which is make himself profoundly unattractive on screen. From his ginger-dyed mop to his hoop earring to his black shark eyes Gordo is the epitome of bumbling awkward creep one you never can tell is malevolent or just innocently clueless. While his performance is spot on Edgertons true talents show in his directing abilities. This is a film without an ounce of fat -- it is lean mean and effectively suspenseful. Yes he uses the oldest tricks in the book and thriller cliches pop up left and right (what is it with women jogging in these movies?). But each of these moments are executed perfectly and there are some exceptional scares. The film is beautifully shot with extensive use of practical lamp light either dimming or brightening the rooms. Theres a thematic aesthetic motif around windows and their reflections that adds to the suspense but also serves to elucidate the conflicts between the characters. They are separated by these invisible barriers -- barriers that reflect images. But what is real? The perception of the reflection? These windows are used to great effect both stylistically and in serving the story. The gorgeous modern house itself becomes the fourth player in this chilling dance of power dynamics and paranoia as they do in most great thrillers. The film is remarkable in how tightly controlled it is but as it weaves its way to conflict and resolution this control reveals itself to be a type of restraint. For all that was promised theres a catharsis lacking. But it seems that a violent denouement wouldnt be what Edgerton would want. Hes much more concerned with the ways in which dark ideas can implant themselves and fester rotting a person from the inside out. Its a much darker notion anyway and while you might be craving a wild release at the end of this tension-filled ride the film denies that to the audience forcing them to ponder much more existential questions instead. Its a bit frustrating that Robyn who is the emotional core of the film throughout is reduced to a psychological revenge battleground between two men. Though we are in tune with her wants and desires and fears throughout that gets lost as the battle wages on. At one point the film seems like it might be moving in the direction of a classic psychological female thriller in the vein of ""Bunny Lake is Missing"" or ""Repulsion"" where female emotion is pathologized and mocked. But it pulls back on that as it pulls back on some other tendencies. Unfortunately its not about Robyns paranoia and agency -- shes just a pawn. Bateman gives a fine performance swiftly and easily turning up and down the sinister edge on his smooth charm. But while the film seems to focus on Hall and Bateman the true star of ""The Gift"" is Edgerton as director. His deft controlled maneuvering of plot character style and tone is damn near perfect for his feature debut -- even if it is in service of a very standard genre piece.

Every film is part of one genre or another and its been a while since a new one was created. Mentioning genre is as tacky as calling something derivative.

BRAD WHEELER Contributed to The Globe and Mail Published Friday Aug. 07 2015 1200AM EDT Last updated Friday Aug. 07 2015 1200AM EDT Comments AA Directed by Joel Edgerton Written by Joel Edgerton Starring Starring Jason Bateman Rebecca Hall Joel Edgerton Country USA Language English Simon says the guy is ""odd."" Wife Robyn defends him waving off his weirdness as social awkwardness. Simon says that in high school the guy was called ""Gordo the Weirdo."" Robyn wonders if her husband is being too hard on the guy ""I think hes nice and very generous"" she says.Gordo does have an unsettling manner. His low-end toupee look and unflattering goatee do not help in that regard. But he also seems damaged. He talks with a choked voice and has the sad skittish mien of a dog that has been kicked around. The fourth film in the Mad Max franchise starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron lands in theatres on May 15. Movie Preview Summer movie preview From Fantastic Four to Poltergeist 19 flicks coming your way And they say every dog has its day - perhaps now Gordo wants his.What to make of Gordo is the viewers dilemma when cautiously unwrapping The Gift a persuasive disconcerting film about bullying and bygones that are never altogether gone. Gordo is portrayed with nuance by Joel Edgerton who also wrote produced and directed this low-riding psychological thriller and convincing creeper.The Gift gives slowly and keeps us guessing - guessing not only about Gordo but about Jason Batemans Simon a successful and passively alpha-male sales executive at a computer security company. In the middle is Robyn Simons fragile empathetic and unsure wife - a role nailed by Rebecca Hall. Essentially were Robyn wondering not only about Gordos game but Simons as well.Wife and husband have moved back to California determined for a fresh start - what happened before? - in their glassy mid-century modern home. They come across Gordo at a furniture store. He recognizes Simon as an old classmate (not really a friend it appears) and uses that tenuous connection to integrate himself into a social (and eventually disruptive) relationship with the couple.The Gift recalls the stalked terrorized or targeted yuppies of Fatal Attraction and Pacific Heights. Unlike the baddies in those films Gordos invasiveness is more subtle and his motives are more mysterious. Hes no bunny boiler though the couples dog does go missing.And Gordo might not even be the villain here. Simons evasiveness when pressed by his wife as to the full nature of their schoolmate past is troubling. Whos the antagonist?The viewers sympathy for either man is changeable; Edgertons touch as a director and writer is fluid - he eerily holds our attention like Hitchcock holds a door for Tippi Hedren.""You think youre done with the past"" Gordo says. ""But the past isnt done with you."" The sentiment is both sad and ominous.The film ends with a delicious question an uncertainty that will linger long after the credits roll - no ribbon is tied on The Gift.

And the characters behaviors early in the film dont jibe with later revelations so the suspense deflates like a punctured tire.Jason Bateman stars as Simon a security system sales exec who has transferred back to his California hometown with his wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall). Simons a jerk and Bateman plays him with just the right air of dismissive cockiness a Bateman trademark that he sometimes softens but not here.Early on he bumps into Gordo (Edgerton) a high school classmate whose outdated facial hair chump haircut and schlubby jackets point to his days as ""Gordo the Weirdo"" not being behind him. Gordo tries to befriend Simon and Robyn but theres something simmering below his forced smile -- something that as it turns out takes too long to unravel.""The Gift"" winds up becoming a revenge tale but its comeuppance raises too many questions of its own. It touches on notions of trust the male ego and forgiveness but Edgerton doesnt overturn any new stones. His ""Gift"" has nice wrapping but whats inside is a letdown.agrahamdetroitnews.comtwitter.com/grahamoramaThe GiftGRADE CRated R For languageRunning time 108 minutes 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 8 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1NdJgfF MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/08/07/past-comes-knocking-murky-revenge-tale-gift/31267915/,200,thegift(2015)10,thegift(2015),detroitnews

Aug. 6 2015The Gift Starring Jason Bateman Rebecca Hall and Joel Edgerton. Written and directed by Joel Edgerton. Opens Aug. 7 at GTA theatres. 107 minutes. 14AThe early jump scares along with the voyeuristic camera and creepy human behaviour make no secret of The Gifts frightful intentions.But this indie pulse-raiser is more of a stealth shocker than an overt one even if the twisted payoff is telegraphed to anyone paying attention.Article Continued BelowThe hook is trying to figure out whats really on the mind of Gordo the character played by actor/screenwriter Joel Edgerton in his promising directing debut. Gordo is a former high school friend of Jason Batemans Simon who reconnects with his long-lost (but not forgotten) chum after Simon and his spouse Robyn (Rebecca Hall) move to L.A. from Chicago.Simon and Robyn found a great house in the Hollywood Hills and his job as a security systems expert and her job as an interior designer should keep them busy. Theyd like to be even busier with an ankle-biter running around but Mother Nature is sadly not co-operating.All too eager to please is quietly insistent Gordo whose constants gifts and hospitality start to chafe the suspicious Simon who recalls that his classmate used to be called ""Gordo the weirdo."" The guileless Robyn just sees a socially inept guy who could use a friend or two.Eventually even Robyn faces reality but by then her fears have multiplied.Peter HowellHow to Change the WorldDirected by Jerry Rothwell. Opens Aug. 7 at Bloor Hot Docs Cinema. 115 minutes. STCJerry Rothwells Canada/UK co-production tells the story of the environmental pioneers who in 1971 began the antinuke protests that led to the creation of Greenpeace and the green movement itself. Almost a ""found footage"" movie it makes excellent use of 1500 archived 16 mm reels supplemented with fresh interviews and some animation. The doc reveals how idealism bravery and accident (""Greenpeace"" was originally a banner slogan) came together to forge a global movement to save the planet. The first act of defiance by these Vancouver-based stalwarts was to sail into a nuclear test zone. They captured major media attention as they bravely took on foes much bigger than themselves the warmongers of the Nixon Administration who planned to explode a five-megaton atomic bomb on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. After that tense confrontation they fearlessly faced down the harpoons of Russian whalers who were illegally harvesting immature whales and an international movement was born.Theres both comedy and drama in the disparate personalities who bonded struggled and clashed the late Bob Hunter an ex-journalist and reluctant leader; firebrand Paul Watson still a no-surrender warrior against whalers; and pragmatic Patrick Moore whose moderate vision is too corporate for many. Peter HowellDiamond TonguesStarring Leah Fay Goldstein Leah Wildman. Directed by Pavan Moondi Brian Robertson. 100 minutes. Opens Friday at TIFF Bell Lightbox. 14ALeah Fay Goldstein plays an actress with marginal talent. Fortunately she really can act otherwise Diamond Tongues would be a serious waste of time.Instead thanks to Goldsteins performance and a smart screenplay that knows its subject well -- the life of struggling thespians -- its a film of dark wit and uncommon depth.The story follows the travails of Edith (Goldstein) as life delivers one blow after another including roommate Clare (Leah Wildman) whos more talented and successful and ex-boyfriend Ben who lands the lead in a low-budget horror film despite having no experience. David John Phillips is devastating as predatory acting coach Derek. The film starts out with Edith cast as ""annoyed customer"" extra engaging in small talk with a bored crew guy. With her bleached blond hair and ruby lips she comes across as childlike.But there are far darker currents below the surface and its amazing how well the neophyte Goldstein captures a character whose envy craftiness and ambition make her both unlikeable yet totally believable.But there is faint hope for Edith in a script laden with mordant humour that offers a climactic scene in which she begins to see her true self offering hope for redemption.Bruce DeMaraThe Cocksure LadsStarring Lyndon Ogbourne Adam McNab. Written and directed by Murray Foster. 96 minutes. Opens Friday at the Carlton Cinema. PGMurray Foster is clearly a serious anglophile.(Well perhaps ""serious"" isnt the right word.)How else to explain The Cocksure Lads a musical comedy about a four-man British retro-pop band who arrive in Toronto for their first North American gig hoping to become ""wildly rich and famous""?The film is the brainchild of Foster a bass player for Great Big Sea who along with Mike Foster -- both of the defunct Toronto band Moxy Fruvous -- have put together a slew of toe-tapping tunes to accompany Fosters screenplay about four fairly daft lads from over the pond who spend a day in the city fighting drinking and chasing women with varying degrees of success.The dialogue is festooned with lots of Brit-isms such as ""wanker"" ""bollocks"" and ""wellies"" (rubber boots that drummer Blakey played by Edward Hillier likes to wear in the bath.) Theres even a song called ""Mushy Peas.""The day starts off with a big to-do when lead singer Dusty Fosterboard (Lyndon Ogbourne) demands 50 per cent of the bands earnings and abruptly quits -- jeopardizing their impending performance.The film is engaging and well-cast and Peter Higginson is delightfully understated as the bands aged and world-weary retainer Monty.Bruce DeMaraThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

"Review The Gift takes a masterful thrill ride into the unexpected - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Gift takes a masterful thrill ride into the unexpected The Gift movie review Matt Kennedy / STX Entertainment Rebecca Hall Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton in ""The Gift."" Rebecca Hall Jason Bateman and Joel Edgerton in ""The Gift."" (Matt Kennedy / STX Entertainment) Gary Goldstein ""You are done with the past but the past is not done with you"" Gordon warns after a turbulent reunion with his old classmate Simon in ""The Gift"" a disturbing drama that twists its outsider-from-hell story into something more unique and unexpected than its marketing campaign might imply.Joel Edgerton the Aussie actor best known for roles in ""Animal Kingdom"" ""Warrior"" and the 2013 version of ""The Great Gatsby"" writes and makes an auspicious directorial debut here. He also plays the pivotal Gordon ""Gordo"" Moseley a mysterious awkward fellow who works his way into the seemingly shiny lives of sales exec Simon (Jason Bateman) and Simons interior designer wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall). But to what end? Simon a Southern California native and Robyn have just relocated to Los Angeles from Chicago. After running into Gordo one day in a home decor store the couple are unsettled by Gordos repeated overtures of friendship -- and a string of intrusive gift deliveries. That Gordo tends to show up unannounced at their Midcentury Modern home in the Hollywood Hills gives Simon and Robyn further pause. Though Simon is of the ""lets cut bait"" school Robyn is more sympathetic to the curious Gordo.A deceptive dinner party however in which host Gordo displays dubious behavior in an equally dubious setting would seem to end any possible friendship with Simon and Robyn. But that only marks the beginning of a new phase of emotional unraveling in which the sins of the past come to bear on the present. Its a given that ""bygones"" will rear their ugly head here and will not go unpunished. But how why and by whom -- that is what lends Edgertons script its power and fascination. See the most-read entertainment stories gt;gt;Open link To divulge much more might spoil a superior film in an overworked genre once heavily populated by the likes of ""Fatal Attraction"" ""Pacific Heights"" ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" and other domestic thrillers. Suffice to say that theres an eerie profundity to the pictures second half that gives ""The Gift"" surprising weight and thematic resonance.Although the film builds an effective sense of dread and contains its share of unnerving visuals and well-timed scares it proves far more psychological thrill ride than shockfest. Take heart No bunnies were boiled in the making of this movie. Read more movie reviews gt;gt;Open link Bateman not quite cast against type but certainly in a more dire mode than usual plays the cavalierly dismissive dont-look-back Simon with calculated intrigue; its a masterful turn. Hall brings deft pathos and shading to the sensitive Robyn. Meanwhile Edgerton juggles his characters weirdness sadness and dodginess with aplomb. The films stirring ending is just one more way Edgertons approach upends expectation makes us think and should inspire conversation.

Comments click to enlarge The Gift Recommended Video Rated R  108 minutes  2015 This cagey suspense film was originally called ""Weirdo"" but the ultimate release title bland as it might seem is actually closer to the mark the story is like one of those gift-wrapped boxes with another box inside and another inside that one. The early scenes promise a routine stalker scenario a successful salesman (Jason Bateman) and his loving wife (Rebecca Hall) move into a new home and endure a series of unexpected and increasingly unwelcome visits from an old schoolmate of the salesmans (Joel Edgerton). Yet Edgerton directing his own script purposely avoids the old genre tropes shifting ones sympathy from the hero to the villain and back again (but not quite). Edgerton--who also wrote The Square (2008) and the story for The Rover (2014)--exploits Batemans smarty-pants persona to chilling effect; hes the rare triple threat whos more valuable behind the camera than in front of it.

Creepy but with an unbecoming twist.Jason Batemans performance as Simon makes up for some of the weaker characters.(Photo STX Entertainment)Story HighlightsCritics Rating 3 stars out of 5The weak female lead makes the film more absurd than frightening.Jason Batemans performance is the main attraction.Its said that time heals all wounds but that dictum is not in play in actor Joel Edgertons directorial debut ""The Gift"" where sins best left in the distant past are avenged at an unaffordable cost. Its a confident thriller suffused with dread that builds suspense without breaking until its too late to turn back -- with a few jump scares thrown in for good measure.Its an assured debut from a rising star that nails tone and pace. It would be a solid summer thriller were it not grossly undermined by its astonishingly regressive treatment of its leading lady.Married couple Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) are at a chic home-furnishings store buying the finishing touches for a just-purchased modernist mansion befitting a man whos just landed a prestigious gig at a billion-dollar company. All is wedded bliss until an unfamiliar man interrupts them and introduces himself as Gordo (Edgerton) an old high-school chum of Simons. The couple suffer the banal pleasantries and small talk that such encounters necessitate and make their merry way.Gordo though cant take a hint and keeps showing up to leave gifts at their doorstep (for which they never gave him the address). Sometimes its wine sometimes its glass cleaner (he noticed the house has a lot of windows) sometimes its koi fish for the couples empty pond.Robyns ridiculous fragility keeps the danger from ever feeling plausible. (Photo STX Entertainment)You dont generally see this many red flags outside of a bullfight. But Robyn nevertheless sees him as a pathetic figure and is sympathetic to his loneliness. She too is lonely and spends her days padding around an empty house between interior-design commissions; shes almost relieved each time Gordo shows up unannounced while Simons at work.Its supposed to make Robyn seem kindhearted but instead makes her the films primary weakness for the sake of plot contrivance. Robyn is fragile trusting and forgiving to an extent made all the more ludicrous by the insulting cause an old prescription-pill addiction and a failed pregnancy. Here is a woman so fragile so barely there so eager to disappear in her wardrobe consisting completely of neutral colors that she fails basic tests of stranger danger far past the point of absurdity because of a miscarriage.AZCENTRALThe Gift (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsSimon though is no such wilting flower and Batemans performance as a businessman on the rise eager to protect his standing and his family at any cost is the films chief pleasure. Where Gordo and Robyn lack dimension Bateman reveals Simons character layer by increasingly ugly layer until it almost doesnt matter what past wrong gave birth to this slowly building comeuppance. ""This worlds about (expletive) winners and losers"" he says espousing his particularly Darwinian world view. ""Were all in the same (expletive) playground.""And it would be gratifying to watch the fists fly in that playground fight were the cost not so grotesque. What was a suspenseful thriller anchored by respectable-to-outstanding performances is undermined by a third-act revelation that reduces Robyn to a mere pawn for the men to play out their psychodrama. ""The Gift"" should know better even if Simon and Gordo dont.Reach the reporter at barbara.vandenburgharizonarepublic.com or 602-444-8371.

If a horror movie or thriller needs to raise the stakes...2015-08-06 Enlarge Photo Close Share Tweet Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Share on Tumblr A- The Gift Status In Season Posted August 6 2015 -- 1151 AM EDT Its too often that filmmakers mistake whats disgusting or startling for whats truly unsettling. If a horror movie or thriller needs to raise the stakes for its hero or freak out the audience theres an easy solution Kill the friend. Gore the dog. Fill a bathtub with blood and guts. The Gift the new film from writer-director-star Joel Edgerton effectively sees what other films in the genre do for their scares shakes its head and says ""No no no. Ill show you messed up."" But the real joy of The Gift is getting to that twisted goodness because more than anything Edgertons script and direction demonstrate a keen understanding of tension and what puts an audience on edge. The film begins with Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) a married couple who have had their share of ups and downs riding a recent up--a big promotion for Simon--into a new mid-century modern home which has lots and lots of windows. The unnerving lack of privacy is a simple detail that immediately sets the tone--and pays off handsomely later on--as the couple coincidentally runs into an old classmate of Simons Gordo (Edgerton). But what begin as kind neighborly gestures on Gordos part morph into something vaguely sinister as he repeatedly shows up at the house unannounced and makes reference to an unresolved incident in his shared past with Simon. Is Gordo a creep who needs to just go away? Or is he a sadly misunderstood loner in desperate need of some reciprocated kindness? The Gift takes its time answering the questions it poses while tackling bigger ideas about the pasts role in the present and how we justify our privilege in relation to misfortune in the lives of others. The mystery around Gordos intentions develops slowly enough for the audience to identify with both Robyns and Simons points of view and a lot of the credit belongs to Hall and Bateman. She is sharp and compassionate. He has a cynical wit thats too charming to fully trust. Each is perfectly cast and freed by roles that arent dumbed down to make way for the surprise-filled plot. From start to finish The Gift is impeccably structured--everything from the sound design to the framing works toward a singular unsettling goal. And if there has to be one takeaway its that Hollywood needs more from Joel Edgerton whos making his feature directorial debut. Through his deliberate pacing believable character work and masterful understanding of cinematic suspense Edgerton proves that The Gift shouldnt be the last present he gives to us.

"The Gift review A thriller wrapped in suspense - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Gift review A thriller wrapped in suspense The Gift Matt Kennedy / AP Rebecca Hall from left and Jason Bateman play a married couple whose lives are disrupted by Joel Edgertons character. Rebecca Hall from left and Jason Bateman play a married couple whose lives are disrupted by Joel Edgertons character.   (Matt Kennedy / AP) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Mismarketed as a slasher film Joel Edgertons crafty directorial debut showcases three excellent performances A delayed-secret suspense thriller of unusual stealth ""The Gift"" comes from actor and screenwriter Joel Edgerton here making his feature directorial debut. Among this summers worthwhile movies this one faces a particular challenge since its marketing campaign makes it look like a slasher outing.Its not. Check the MPAA rating for a clue ""The Gift"" received an R for language and language alone; no violence. So some will see ""The Gift"" expecting one sort of thing but theyll be getting another. All three leading performers are scarily convincing on the films own tight clammy terms. Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall play Simon and Robyn recently moved from Chicago back to Simons native Los Angeles. Simons a security system salesman up for a promotion; Robyn a graphic designer is struggling with the emotional aftermath of a miscarriage.Shopping one day they chance upon Simons old high school classmate a quiet tense fellow named Gordo. Hes brought to life by Edgerton with a calm quiet authority pointing to trouble around the bend. At first Gordos attempts to ingratiate are touching A bottle of wine appears on the couples doorstep followed by fish for the koi pond. Gordo who does not talk much about his own life invites the couple over for dinner at his unexpectedly plush digs. Simon a controlling sort of fellow is creeped out by his old acquaintances pushy needy impulses. Somethings going on under the surface of the social encounters indicated by Gordos early promise that hes willing to forget what happened when he and Simon were teenagers and to ""let bygones be bygones."" Gradually ""The Gift"" unwraps the story of what happened back then while playing a clever shell game with the characters and our sympathies in the present day.Bateman has a unique screen quality and hes giving his most intriguing performance to date here. Best known for being the sly voice of relative reason in raunchy comedies (""Horrible Bosses"" ""Identity Thief"") his timing is practically unerring and he doesnt bother with finding ways to make the audience like his characters. Theres a steely edge to his technique and its extremely well suited to ""The Gift."" (Cant say more; spoilers.) Hall one of the most honest and expressive of all contemporary movie actors is superb at realizing her characters innate sadness and what shes doing to shove it aside in a marriage built less on trust than on moving forward at any cost. The Gift star Joel Edgerton says words really can hurt us Nina Metz A young couple played by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are recent transplants to Los Angeles at the beginning of ""The Gift"" a psychological thriller that throws their seemingly upwardly mobile sun-dappled existence into chaos when an old high school acquaintance arrives as if out of thin air... A young couple played by Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall are recent transplants to Los Angeles at the beginning of ""The Gift"" a psychological thriller that throws their seemingly upwardly mobile sun-dappled existence into chaos when an old high school acquaintance arrives as if out of thin air... (Nina Metz) Edgerton wrote and acted in ""The Square"" released in 2010 in the U.S. The film played around with genre conventions (film noir in that instance) to similarly gratifying results. In ""The Gift"" Edgerton and cinematographer Eduard Grau nudge the camera forward very subtly using slow creep-in-closer shots to focus our unease. Elements of the script are certainly familiar; Michael Hanekes psychological thriller ""Cache"" is one possible reference point and theres a sinister final plot development that goes all the way back to Elizabethan and Jacobean theater (as well as Bruce Norris play ""Purple Heart""). Some of the scare bits in ""The Gift"" feel secondhand. But even with various supporting players doing their part at heart this is a three-character chamber piece. And Bateman Hall and Edgerton are three very interesting actors showcased in a confident directorial debut.Michael Phillips is a Tribune Newspapers critic. The Gift (Clip) Clip Dinner Party.

After moving into a new house Robyn (played by Rebecca Hall) and Simon (Jason Bateman) eventually learn to beware acquaintances bearing gifts. Photo Matt Kennedy Associated Press The Gift breaks the rules and thats a good thing 1 / 1 Back to Gallery In the first minutes of ""The Gift"" a newly relocated couple is looking at a house with a real estate agent and thinking about buying. They like the view. They dont realize theyre in a thriller and so they violate the first rule of thrillers which is ""Dont buy a house with glass walls. Sure during the day you will have a view but at night you will become the view and you will not like whos watching."" A scene or two later theyre in a store and the husband Simon (Jason Bateman) is approached by a man he doesnt at first recognize. Hes Gordon played by Joel Edgerton who also wrote and directed and apparently he and Simon went to high school together. Simons wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) is immediately friendly to the old acquaintance and they exchange some personal information thus violating the second rule of thrillers ""It is utterly essential -- indeed a matter of life and death -- that you assume everyone you meet is insane."" ""The Gift"" takes its title from the thoughtful little gifts that Gordon starts leaving at the couples door. Then he starts showing up always polite and helpful if perhaps a bit socially awkward but theres nothing about him that is particularly alarming unless youve seen this kind of movie before. If you have you will be sure to remember the third rule of thrillers going back all the way to Norman Bates and beyond ""Emotional neediness is the first sign of a homicidal maniac."" This is whats so good about ""The Gift"" It keeps some of the rules of thrillers (there are more than three) but it violates others and it will keep you guessing until the last minutes about which rules it plans to keep or discard. The movie replaces the familiar sense of inevitability with an overall aura of dread. Better yet the movies surprises come from more than a filmmakers calculated impulse to surprise. Edgerton actually has something to say and uses the maniac-menaces-nice-people genre as his vehicle for saying it. Along the way he ends up expanding a genre that could certainly use a little letting out. The performances are rich and get richer upon reflection. Hall is the movies open book sensitive intelligent and frightened. The men are harder to read. Edgerton makes it clear that there is something very wrong with Gordon but the specifics of whats wrong reveal themselves only gradually. Bateman as Simon is the movies most complex creation an unusual combination of blitheness and irritability breeziness and anger. He is at least as interesting as the man whos menacing him. The only drawback a substantial one is that when its over you may remember things that happened in the movie that dont entirely make sense in retrospect. Theres nothing here that isnt justifiable. Arguments could be made. But ""The Gift"" stretches things a little too much for it to be a first-rate thriller. Still among second-rate thrillers its one of the best.

Photo Matt Kennedy MOVIE REVIEW The Gift Running time 107 minutes. Rated R (violence language). The long-term effects of bullying are at the heart of ""The Gift"" a dark and ultimately quite nasty psychological thriller from actor/writer/debut director Joel Edgerton who manages to yank the carpet out from under his audience a couple of times. Handsome couple Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) new to LA are stopped by Gordon (Edgerton) who recognizes Simon from high school. Shrugging off the encounter Simon vaguely recalls ""Gordo"" who was always a little odd. He sure is Edgertons in full awkward-creep mode with strange flat mannerisms and dead eyes. Eager to renew their acquaintance Gordo showers the couple with housewarming trinkets showing up when Simons at work and the artsy Robyn is alone in their sunny mansion brooding. Recovering from a miscarriage shes beset by strange dreams and bad vibes with which Edgerton infuses a ""Rosemarys Baby"" sort of dread. But she takes a liking to Gordo who joins them for dinner and regales her with stories of her husbands golden-boy teen years. Joel Edgerton (from left) Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall.Photo Matt Kennedy Predictably things fall apart. Simon tells Gordo -- whom he dismisses as ""Weirdo"" behind his back -- to get lost after one obsessive gesture too many. Horror-movie paces ensue. (As a first-timer Edgerton can perhaps be forgiven for the ""cat behind the refrigerator door"" false-alarm jolts.) The koi in the pond a present from Gordo are dead. And the dogs missing. ""What does let bygones be bygones mean?"" Robyn asks her husband of a threatening note from Gordo. Is their stalker deranged? Or traumatized? Why doesnt Simon claim to remember him? Questioning her sanity the newly pregnant Robyn digs for answers enlisting help from a neighbor (Allison Tolman of TVs ""Fargo"") and one of Simons old friends (David Denman). What she finds about the mens past blossoms into interesting territory about identity human behavior and trust. The films finale though is so cheap and ugly it nearly undoes everything good that came before it. You may feel a little bullied yourself as the credits roll.

Share Tweet Joel Edgertons directorial debut The Gift comes packaged as one of those glossy ""adult"" thrillers that hit peak popularity in the late 80s and early 90s the kind in which some perfect American family is menaced by a smiling human monster a wolf in sheeps clothing. On the surface its an odd starring vehicle for Jason Bateman exasperated straight man of Arrested Development fame who rarely appears in projects so devoid of comic intention. But tear back the layers of suspense the film wraps itself in and its easy to see how with a few tweaks its basic scenario could be played for laughs Its basically a cringe comedy with the comedy withheld spinning off from the dilemma of how to tell someone from your past that you dont want them to become part of your present. And for Bateman it offers a new opportunity to twist an essential component of his star persona--that impatience he plays to the hilt--into something much darker.Bateman is not by the way the ostensible antagonist of The Gift. That role belongs instead to Edgerton who casts himself as Gordon a fidgety unnerving military veteran who insinuates himself into the lives of the ostensible protagonists. First seen lurking in the background of the frame like a lost spirit thats gusted into view Gordon approaches estranged high-school classmate Simon (Bateman) at a home-goods store where the latter is shopping with his wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall). Simon doesnt initially recognize Gordon (its been decades) and the encounter--perfectly acted and staged to emphasize the discrepancy in significance it holds for the two men--ends with a polite empty promise to catch up soon. Gordon however takes it upon himself to make those vague plans concrete and begins showing up unannounced at Simon and Robyns swanky new house inviting himself inside and leaving behind presents like a school of fish for their koi pond. ""A little socially awkward"" is how Robyn charitably describes their clingy new friend while Simon dusts off an ancient nickname ""Gordo The Weirdo.""So far so familiar. The Gift escalates accordingly as Gordons behavior goes from annoying and inconvenient to frighteningly stalkerish especially once Simon decides to ""break up"" with him. Edgerton who also wrote the script creates an atmosphere of uncomfortable surveillance gliding his camera around the edges of the couples glass box of a home. (Its one of those midcentury modern houses with more windows than walls--an unfortunately transparent sanctuary for two people who feel exposed as it is.) Edgerton isnt above a hoary jump scare or two but he otherwise tackles his Cape Fear premise with a degree of technical and dramatic intelligence.More impressive however are the games the film plays with the audiences sympathies. It becomes increasingly clear that Simon and Gordon have a history one that goes far beyond having shared a classroom. As Robyn begins looking into what happened between them essentially running an amateur background check on her own husband The Gift gains power not so much from the unraveling of its central mystery but from how it dismantles the typical rooting interests of the genre. The performances play a big role in this reversal. Embodying a kind of alpha-bro version of his usual sarcastic everyman Bateman unleashes the cruelty that sometimes nips at the edges of his comedic creations; hes all confidence no compassion. Hall meanwhile reconfirms her talent for investing genre material with emotional honesty here finding a strong dramatic arc--a terrible slow-motion awakening--in what is essentially a reactive housewife role. Shed make a mean Rosemary of Rosemarys Baby.Pivoting out of conventional horror-flick territory into the realm of psychodrama and drastically blurring the lines separating its heroes from its villains The Gift turns out to be much smarter and more troubling than it looks on the surface. That is until the serious regression of its final act. Working himself into a corner Edgerton betrays the less-sensational course he sets. Rather than continuing to explore what happens to a relationship when one party really sees the other for who they are the film cooks up a particularly sour climactic twist choosing elaborate revenge-plot machinations over the agency of its heroine. Its exactly the kind of ""mind-blowing"" trash-thriller ending the movie seems to be admirably consistently steering away from for much of its running time. Unexpected nuance is in this case a gift that does not keep giving.For thoughts on and a place to discuss the plot details not talked about in this review visit The Gifts spoiler space.

"Review An unsettling 20-year secret comes to light in The Gift - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeReview An unsettling 20-year secret comes to light in The GiftBy Sandy Cohen Associated Press Posted 08/04/2015 032645 PM PDTUpdated 08/04/2015 044908 PM PDT Nobody likes a bully -- especially a past victim with a long memory. Figuring out whos the bully and whos the victim is part of the mystery in ""The Gift"" a satisfying directorial debut from writer producer and actor Joel Edgerton. While it doesnt break any new ground this first feature from STX Entertainment succeeds as an unsettling psychological thriller that mioght make you want to check the locks on the front door. Simon (Jason Bateman) and wife wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall) just moved from Chicago to a picture-perfect house in his hometown of Los Angeles where he has a great new job and an impending promotion. Simon insists his wife not start working right away so they can focus on starting a family. Jason Bateman as Simon in The Gift. (Matt Kennedy/STX Productions) ( Matt Kennedy/STX Productions ) While shopping the couple bumps into Simons old high school classmate Gordo (Edgerton). Shy and awkward he re-introduces himself to Simon who doesnt recognize him. They exchange pleasantries and innocuously part ways. Suddenly a bottle of wine appears on the couples doorstep a gift from Gordo though they hadnt given him their address. Then he pops by unannounced ostensibly to be helpful. More spontaneous gifts arrive -- he fills their pond with koi -- along with a dinner invitation.To Robyn Gordo seems lonely. To Simon he seems delusional. He remembers they called him ""Weirdo"" back in high school. When Simon insists they cut ties Gordo responds with an ominous reference to their shared history which inspires Robyn to question what happened between them as teenagers. Advertisement She becomes the protagonist in the films second half an amateur detective investigating her husbands past. The more she discovers the more she distrusts him. Gordo doesnt seem so solid either.Along the way theres a pond of dead fish a disappearing dog and a scary shower sequence with nerves ratcheted to the max with the effective film score by Danny Bensi and Saunder Jurriaans.Edgertons film pays homage to the polished stylized thrillers of the 1980s and 90s when things went bad for the Yuppie generation. The sprawling glass-walled pond-fronted house where Robyn and Simon live is so gorgeously aspirational that its practically a character in the film. Gordos class envy is revealed when he tries to outshine their home with his own. Edgerton keeps his screenplay timely by his use of bullying as a backdrop. He also makes Robyn an equal to Simon empowered to stand on her own. The lead performances look effortless a credit to Edgertons direction. His Gordo is eerily on point as a quiet lurker with a menacing side. Hall is commanding as a confident yet vulnerable wife conflicted about the man she married. And Bateman deliciously plays against type as a manipulative back-slapping executive who will step on anyone to get ahead. At its conclusion ""The Gift"" takes a leap thats hard to believe but it doesnt undo the storys main theme which could be summed up as ""what happens when you poison other peoples minds with ideas.""

The Gift is Edgertons first directing gig and he also writes produces and stars. Multi-tasking becomes him; this is an impressive debut heart-racingly channelling the likes of The Hand That Rocks the Cradle. Successful young couple Robyn (Rebecca Hall) and Simon (Jason Bateman) move into a peeping-Tom-friendly house made almost entirely of glass (their first mistake). They bump into Gordo (Edgerton) an oddball who says he went to high school with Simon but starts turning up with creepy presents while Robyn is home alone. She begins to suspect that his sudden appearance may be her husbands past coming back to haunt them. The Gift spends most of its time keeping us guessing but jumps wholeheartedly into a horrible spine-tinglingly exhilarating climax. Edgerton lays on the tension - those windows really grate on your nerves - expertly delivering the old-school jumpy moments. Halls troubled pill-taking Robyn is beautifully understated a performance that gives the film an entirely plausible focus and balances Edgertons occasionally too weirdo-weird Gordo perfectly. The Gift will have you triple-locking the doors and rushing to pull the curtains.

Think ""The hand that rocked the Cradle"" or ""Single white female""- if thats the kind of movie that you want you will enjoy this. It feels quite up to date and it is an excellent addition to the psychological thriller canon. My main criticism of the film would be how unpleasant all the characters are. Had it been released in the 1990s it probably would have received 5 stars but we expect even villians to have some redeeming features now. Having said that if you are in the mood for a creepy thriller this film will satisfy that need very well.

The sins of the high-school cafeteria come home to roost in ""The Gift"" a coolly unsettling thriller that begins as an unironic homage to late-80s/early-90s yuppies-in-peril dramas like ""Fatal Attraction"" and ""The Hand That Rocks the Cradle"" before taking a turn toward the moral and existential minefield of Michael Hanekes ""Cache."" A modest but accomplished directing debut for actor and screenwriter Joel Edgerton (who also gives himself a plum role here) ""The Gift"" is a more psychological slow-burn genre exercise than the psycho-stalker shocker its being sold as by DIY horror specialists Blumhouse and Robert Simonds newly launched STX Entertainment. But some supremely effective chills and good word of mouth could spell sleeper success for this Aug. 7 opener. To an extent ""The Gift"" functions as a riff on what might be Edgertons pet theme -- that of an ordinary man undone by a little white lie that grows into a mushroom cloud of deceit. In Edgertons script for the absorbing 2013 Aussie police drama ""Felony"" that ordinary man was a basically good cop who made an ill-judged decision to conceal his involvement in a drunken hit-and-run. In ""The Gift"" our apparent Everyman hero is Simon (Jason Bateman) a sales exec at a computer security firm who has just moved back to his hometown of Los Angeles with his interior-designer wife Robyn (Rebecca Hall). They luck into a beauty of a mid-century modern in the Hollywood Hills; he seems primed for a promotion at work. All thats (conspicuously) missing is the pitter-patter of little feet though not (as we soon learn) for lack of trying. Instead they acquire a different kind of houseguest in the form of Gordon (Edgerton) an unwelcome blast from Simons past who bumps into the happy couple (seemingly) by chance and little by little inserts himself ever deeper into their lives. At first Gordon just wants to help rather like the title character in French director Dominik Molls darkly funny  2000 thriller ""With a Friend Like Harry"" (an American remake of which has lingered in development hell for the past two decades). Undeniably odd-looking (Edgerton plays the part with pasty reddish-brown hair an unflattering goatee and 80s-style hoop earring in his left ear) and socially maladroit -- back in high school they called him ""Gordo the weirdo"" -- Gordon proffers a series of increasingly extravagant housewarming gifts effectively invites himself over for dinner and otherwise keeps popping up at the darnedest of times. And thats before things really get too close for comfort. Rest assured No bunnies are boiled to a crisp but things do not end well at all for the denizens of a patio koi pond. Some people change dramatically after high school Simon reasons (clearly referring to himself) while others remain the same. But as ""The Gift"" plays out it becomes increasingly clear that both Simon and Gordon are still very much the same people they were 20 years before -- one an unapologetic bully the other his unwitting victim seeking payback for a shameful episode from their shared past. That basic setup gives Edgerton license to play with some venerable genre trappings -- a mysteriously open faucet a missing family pet a shadowy presence encroaching on a foggy shower door -- which for all their familiarity are deployed with a solid understanding of how to make an audience shift nervously in their seats. Where ""The Gift"" toys with our expectations is in its refusal to align itself with any one character or to manufacture obvious heroes and villains. In a typical movie of this sort Gordos efforts to make Simons life a living hell would eventually reach the point where the latters age-old trespasses -- no matter how devastating -- would pale in comparison with the formers vengeful tactics. But Edgerton instead keeps our sympathies tilting to and fro on a knifes edge forcing us to constantly reassess which of these two men is the more lethal sociopath. If ""The Gift"" isnt ultimately as intricate or surprising a movie as ""Felony"" (which was directed by Matthew Saville) it remains the work of a sure-handed craftsman who knows how to keep a story moving and when to tighten the screws. Even at its most routine the movie offers the pleasure of Edgertons own superbly creepy performance which could easily have devolved into ghoulish revenge-of-the-nerd caricature but instead turns Gordo into a simultaneously pitiable and unsettling figure -- a dejected adolescent frozen in time. Bateman who played some of these same themes for comic effect in his own 2013 directorial debut ""Bad Words"" seems completely at ease as a compassionless alpha who views the world in clearly demarcated terms of winners and losers. And Hall casts a sympathetic presence as the woman trying to sort out which if either of these men she wants in her life. ""A Single Man"" d.p.

Drecky creepy garbage with a drug-rape ending that only Bill Cosby could love. Lengthened from 4 minutes to an interminable 2 hours using a DVD revenge note at the end to try to explain the plot because that whole flashback thing is backasswards and plausibility is just too complicated and expensive. The sound designer gets to jangle your nerves because it wasnt happnin in the screenplay.The questions just start at the end such as why didnt they warn me and why didnt I leave when I saw the first red screen.

Somewhat predictable yet still going down a road where you werent sure where you were going to turn next. The movie deserves MUCH higher than a 70. Looking at the reviews from people who actually shell out the bucks to see the movie you see a much more accurate score. I think sometimes the professional critics get so wrapped up in comparisons the need for accepted structure and so forth that they forget to watch the movie and judge it on its own merits. Not the greatest movie in awhile but a good suspense movie nonetheless. Worth the watch.

TWITTER In this throwback to 90s stalker thrillers writer-director Joel Edgerton also stars as a man with an unhealthy fixation on an old schoolmate (Jason Bateman) and his wife (Rebecca Hall). The dog days soon will be upon us and with them the dregs of American cinema dumped unceremoniously into the local multiplex. But you could do a lot worse than The Gift a creepy crafty throwback to early 90s stalker thrillers like Pacific Heights The Hand That Rocks the Cradle Single White Female and Unlawful Entry. Taken on its own undemanding terms and considered within its not very original framework Joel Edgertons feature-length directorial debut is a pleasant -- or pleasantly unpleasant -- surprise hitting its genre marks in brisk unfussy fashion and raising a few hairs on the back of your neck along the way. Its comfort food for fans of films in which mysterious presents appear on doorsteps beloved pets go ominously missing and an attractive woman taking a shower is the surest sign that something wicked this way comes. Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall play Simon and Robyn recently relocated from Chicago to a spacious modern house nestled in the hills of L.A.s East Side. Robyn is recovering from a miscarriage and subsequent depression; Simon is climbing the corporate ladder at a new job. Refreshingly free of expository frills The Gift gets right down to business with Simon and Robyn running into an old high school classmate of Simons the amusingly named Gordo (Edgerton sporting orange-ish hair an earring and ill-fitting flannel) at a store. ""That was awkward"" Simon whispers to Robyn as they walk away but soon enough Gordo is invited for dinner and the three are exchanging pleasantries over plates of pasta in a quietly unnerving scene shot mostly in alternating facial close-ups. Read more Joel Edgerton to Headline Film About Famous Loving v. Virginia Civil Rights Case Things get weird as they always do when a quirky outsider bonds with a couple of shiny happy yuppies in these films. It starts innocuously enough with a bottle of wine sent as a thank-you then takes a more unusual turn when fish appear in Simon and Robins once-empty backyard mini-pond. Before long Gordo has turned into an incorrigible unwanted-gift giver violating all codes of new-friend etiquette and prompting the slick somewhat snarky Simon to nickname him ""Weirdo."" The gentler more melancholy Robyn is not as quick to write him off seeming to relate on some unspoken level to his oddballness and air of vulnerability. Still when it becomes irrefutably clear that Gordo has developed an unhealthy fixation on them -- and is a pathological liar to boot -- even she goes along with her husbands decision to cut him off. That is until a letter arrives from Gordo saying hes willing to ""let bygones be bygones."" Curious about what exactly Gordo is referring to -- what wrong might Simon have committed against Gordo when they were in school together? -- Robyn starts playing detective. Edgerton who wrote recent Australian noirs The Square and Felony has a somewhat cut-and-dry approach to plot and character and indeed The Gift doesnt do much with the relationship between Simon and Gordo. The slight frisson of homoeroticism is never teased out (this is no Chuck amp; Buck despite broad similarities) and theres little genuine mystery or depth to the queasy rekindling of the bond between these two men. But the writer-director knowingly plays on our familiarity with tropes of the genre both stylistic (smash cuts insinuating music scenes that begin with the camera creeping down empty hallways) and narrative (interrupted dinner parties confrontations in dimly lit parking garages intrigue related to the main female characters fertility/maternity) -- and just when you peg The Gift as pure pastiche you notice the film doing things a bit differently. Robyns conflicted feelings toward both Gordo and her own husband emerge as the movies driving force; what first looks like a typical male-dominated revenge fantasy turns into the story of a woman coming to understand which flaws in her partner shes willing to live with and which shes not. Edgerton also slyly alters the template blurring the lines between villain and victim and building to a bleak ambiguous denouement rather than the usual bloody cat-and-mouse climax. Read more Jason Sudeikis Rebecca Hall Rom-Com Tumbledown Nabbed By Starz The Gifts dialogue is movie-ish -- especially when Simon and Robyn are trading domestic banalities in the kitchen -- but not egregiously so. Besides that kind of corny blather (""Theres just something a bit off about him"" and the like) is one of the reassuring pleasures of this kind of film. The movie also benefits from a trio of sturdy lead performances. Edgerton exudes both menace and fragility keeping us guessing as to whether Gordo is unraveling or in supreme control. Bateman shifts seamlessly back and forth between affable charmer and sinister snake. And Halls watchful intelligence and reserve make her an ideal moral compass and audience surrogate. The small supporting cast features most notably Allison Tolman (FXs Fargo) as a welcoming neighbor and Busy Philipps (Cougar Town) as one of Simon and Robyns friends. The 90s vibe is reinforced by a conspicuous lack of smartphone use though the socioeconomic clash implicit in Gordos face-off with Simon feels of-the-moment as does the underlying subtext about bullying and its long-term effects. Still The Gift isnt to be taken too seriously; it is above all a nasty good time.

Its a grim bit of business but its also loaded with the kind of laughter that you need when youre scared like the vent on a pressure cooker. The story revolves around just three people but it draws their world around them with exquisite detail and then as tight as a noose. Most thrillers are about the outsider the stranger the threat; ""The Gift"" stands above those head and shoulders because it also asks deceptively simple questions How well do you know anybody in your life? How well do you know yourself? See Video Joel Edgerton Is a Terrifying Blast From the Past in First The Gift Trailer (Video) The film begins with all-too-perfect married couple Simon (Jason Bateman) and Robyn (Rebecca Hall) moving to L.A. from Chicago for his new job; hes from L.A. she isnt. And at the mall a man hesitates at the sight of Simon stutters and then draws back ""I think I know you ..."" It turns out the mall stranger is Gordon (Edgerton) who Simon knew way back in school. ""We should hang out"" Simon notes politely not expecting Gordon to be too intent on follow-up but Gordon is; Gordon it turns out is pretty intent on a lot of things. Also Read Rebecca Hall to Star in Joel Edgertons Directorial Debut (Exclusive) Its hard to set a thriller in L.A. after all these years and movies; in most films the streets and buildings themselves feel spent exhausted as if everything bad that could have happened already has. But ""The Gift"" is aware of our cinematic relationship with L.A. making nods to everything from Manson to Polanski and warping those cliches as we notice it evoking them. It doesnt take place on the mean streets; it unfolds high in the Hollywood Hills mostly where the houses are beautiful and quiet and just far enough apart that you couldnt hear it if that quiet was broken by a scream. Gordon keeps dropping by; Robyn alone and lonely keeps inviting him in out of simple politeness. Simon finds Gordons ubiquity creepy -- and Robyn will eventually discover why. Also Read Veep Star Timothy Simons Joins Rebecca Hall Michael C. Hall in Christine (Exclusive) Anyone can find chills in a Dickensian crypt; doing so in a mid-century modern with beautiful windows is another matter. Edgerton does exactly that here showing what happens when the characters go outside of the bounds of politeness and into the darker places outside it. As you would hope for any film where things go bump in the night the sound editing and mixing are both superb (Julian Slater is credited with both) not just because of the films shrieking scares but more so due to its uncomfortable silences. Simon it turns out was a bit of a bully as a kid; worse he may be one now. And his marriage isnt as happy as we first think of course. Kudos to Edgerton then for not only writing the script but also directing and starring as Gordon; Gordon used to be called ""Gordo the weirdo"" (a phrase Bateman puts plenty of cruel English on) and we get a glimpse of that in Gordons present-tense social awkwardness and mumbled friendly entreaties that over time get less and less friendly. Batemans Simon shows a lot of the zest and bitter spice the actor brought to the overlooked ""Bad Words"" often saying things like ""Cant we have a nice time?"" and ""The subject is closed"" and similar orders disguised as requests. Hall is also superb -- after being wasted in big-budget films like ""Transcendence"" and ""Iron Man III"" she has a film here worthy of her talents and she uses those talents to make Robyn an actual person neither a third-act savior nor a cowering victim. Also Read Dianna Agron Joins Jason Sudeikis Rebecca Hall Rom-Com Tumbledown Thanks to Edgerton and editor Luke Doolan""The Gift"" has the pace of a bad dream moving faster and faster with a dark gravity that builds until that horrible point when youd hope to wake up. Theres not an ounce of fat here and Edgerton also casts great actors in every role occasionally for a single one-and-done scene like Katie Aselton (""The League"") and P. J. Byrne (""The Wolf of Wall Street""). Nothing here feels cheap or hasty which is why the horror when it comes is all the more chilling and grim. Slick sharp and legitimately terrifying ""The Gift"" is a truly brilliant thriller -- and one hopes the first of many features from Edgerton to come. Breaking News To Your Inbox.
