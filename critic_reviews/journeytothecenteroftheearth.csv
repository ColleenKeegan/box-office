ABOUT THE MOVIEJourney to the Center of the Earth  (out of four)Stars Brendan Fraser Josh Hutcherson Anita Briem Seth MeyersDirector Eric BrevigDistributor New Line Cinema and Walden MediaRatingPG for intense adventure action and some scary momentsRunning time1 hour 29 minutesOpens Friday nationwide SUMMER MOVIE GUIDE By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Journey to the Center of the Earth is not so much a movie as an amusement park ride. As a ride its a reasonably exciting way to pass the time. A perilous sea voyage on a dinosaurs jawbone while dodging flying fish is fun as is a harrowing spin on a mining cart inside a spooky cavern. MORE A journey to the center of Brendan Frasers mind But as a movie its flat and predictable though the visuals are often striking. Based of course on Jules Vernes literary classic the movie starts out well enough while the focus is on Brendan Frasers engaging science professor character. Fraser is so likable smart and funny that his mere presence improves the movie substantially. If he didnt anchor it there wouldnt be much point to see it. The 3-D effects are underwhelming and sometimes a bit of a cheat. Its not very impressive when a measuring tape snaps in our faces and a Swiss army knife floats by seemingly within reaching distance. Scenes with a stampeding dinosaur are derivative bringing to mind Jurassic Park and a flurry of fluttery prehistoric birds is cute but not dazzling. Fraser plays Trevor Anderson an academic who clings to a hypothesis that has been discredited by the rest of his university and presumably the scientific community. Part of the impetus for his belief has to do with his brothers lifes work as a ""Vernian"" -- a devotee of Verne and his theories. As the movie opens his nephew Sean his late brothers teen son comes to spend a few days with Trevor. Initially a bit surly and bored Sean (Josh Hutcherson) is intrigued by Trevors research. He inadvertently stumbles on a key finding and the next thing he knows Trevor is taking him to Iceland. Once there uncle and nephew are taken to a volcanic mountain by a comely guide Hannah (Anita Briem). She happens to be the daughter of a scientist who also was a Vernian. There are some chaste sparks between Trevor and Hannah but the film is one of the most family-friendly of any this summer. Briem is kind of bland and Hutcherson is appealing enough but the movie belongs to Fraser who strikes just the right playful tone. Hes that rare blend of witty intelligent self-deprecating and convincing action hero priming audiences for the Mummy sequel due next month. Theres a recurring joke in which Sean regrets not having read the Verne book when it was on his summer reading list. So the moral of the story kids is Do that summer reading. You never know when it might pay off. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

"Journey to the Center of the Earth cliched | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsNewsJourney to the Center of the Earth cliched Its nice to see civilization progress. Back in 1953 moviegoers willing to put on those awkward cardboard 3D glasses to watch the thriller House of Wax were treated to a wicked paddleball bouncing off the screen.By Philip MarchandMoviesFri. July 11 2008 Journey to the Center of the Earth (out of 4)Starring Brendan Fraser Anita Briem and Josh Hutcherson. Directed by Eric Brevig. In 3D. 92 minutes. At major theatres. PG Its nice to see civilization progress. Back in 1953 moviegoers willing to put on those awkward cardboard 3D glasses to watch the thriller House of Wax were treated to a wicked paddleball bouncing off the screen.In 2008 moviegoers can put on 3D glasses that look like Ray-Bans to watch Journey to the Center of the Earth in 3D and see a yo-yo coming at them with even more devastating effect. A Hollywood school of thought predicts that 3D is the future of movies. Journey to the Center of the Earth along with other recent movies such as Beowulf is meant to sell us on this notion. Im not sure the best way to do this is to echo the past - the way that yo-yo sequence echoes the paddleball or a scene in which a breakneck trip down some underground railroad tracks in Journey to the Center of the Earth echoes a famous roller coaster scene in the 1952 spectacular This is Cinerama. Cinerama failed just like early 3D. The improved technology of Journey to the Center of the Earth promises to be more viable than these early efforts but all depends on the imaginative use of that technology. How about the scene where the hero played by Brendan Fraser brushes his teeth and then suddenly the audience finds itself looking up at his face from the bottom of the sink as the spit and water cascades in glorious 3D out of his mouth? They didnt think of that in 1953. The makers of this movie do have an exciting story to build on based on Jules Vernes 1864 sci-fi novel subsequently filmed in 1959 with James Mason and crooner Pat Boone.In Eric Brevigs 2008 version the story begins when a scientist named Trevor (Fraser) takes charge of his 13-year-old nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) for a few days before the lad joins his mother in Ottawa. ""Its great"" Sean says with cruel sarcasm. ""We get to be Canadians. Eh?""Suddenly Trevor receives important signals of seismic activity in Iceland which he must investigate immediately. Sean goes with him and the two find themselves on a windswept mountain in Iceland with a local guide Hannah (Anita Briem). ""When does the whole adventure thing begin?"" Sean asks with only slightly diminished sarcasm. At least this is better than being a Canadian.When theyre trapped in a cave by a landslide Sean begins to reconsider his blase attitude. From then on the dramatic arc of the movie is simple. The party through a series of accidents eventually finds itself in the centre of the Earth which has plant life a sea and some unpleasant prehistoric creatures. Thats the easy part. The hard part is getting back to the surface. Meanwhile the characters utter lines from the kind of script that Hollywood screenwriters do in their sleep. Theres a bit of emotion (Josh cries over the memory of his defunct dad) a coming-of-age theme a spark of romance between Trevor and Hannah a sprinkling of obligatory humour in the face of death. ""I just remembered something"" Trevor says as he hangs by his fingernails to the edge of a cliff. ""I hate field work.""All this is a rickety frame from which to hang 92 minutes of visual effects. Director Brevig supervised those effects on movies such as Pearl Harbor and The Day After Tomorrow. I dont think anybody can complain about his work here. Whatever kinks remain in 3D technology seem to have been worked out and there are moments especially involving a blue phosphorescent bird hovering in the air of the theatre that are quite impressive. Dramatically however this movie has not evolved beyond This is Cinerama with its awesome roller coaster opening.If 3D is indeed the future of movies were going to need something more substantial than Journey to the Center of the Earth to convince us.

Email Print Share Facebook Twitter Tumblr LinkedIn StumbleUpon Reddit Digg Mixx Del.i.cious Google+ Reprints Follow TIME Fanboys and genre mavens have been well attended to in this summer movie season which was launched with Jon Favreaus Iron Man on May 2 and is likely to reach a climax next week with the Batman sequel The Dark Knight. Today theyre lining up for Hellboy II The Golden Army. Many in this prime demographic -- 14- to 24-year-old males -- have already seen Guillermo del Toros funny freak show at one of the Thursday midnight screenings that have become obligatory for action films. Still that leaves a big chunk of audience pre-teens and their parents. Now that theyve had a chance to catch up with Kung Fu Panda and WALL-E they get two PG-rated live-action fantasies this weekend Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D and the Eddie Murphy comedy Meet Dave. In certain respects they are the same movie the adventures of fairly decent folks who literally fall into an alien world. Journey starring Brendan Fraser is based on the 1864 Jules Verne novel about a scientist and his accomplices who encounter a prehistoric world 4000 miles below the Earths surface. In Meet Dave the travelers are extraterrestrials who have landed on Earth in search of a water supply for their parched home planet. Just from this sketch and the stars names you should know if you want to see these movies or avoid them at all cost. Stuff Jumping Out at You The Verne story has been cinematized a dozen or more times including a TV movie earlier this year with Rick Schroder and Peter Fonda. The one in theaters today directed by Eric Brevig and written by Michael Weiss Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin sticks pretty closely to the plot Professor Trevor Anderson (Fraser) finds a runic inscription of an underground route inside a volcano and with his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and an Icelandic guide (Anna Briem) locates an underworld Eden and all manner of exotic animals. And just as in the Verne they end up in Sicily. Its basically a three-person saga led by Fraser the easygoing Toronto-educated star of the Mummy movies; his reassuring blandness is the very definition of the word Canadian. Hutcherson who was Will Ferrells son in Kicking and Screaming and the older brother in Favreaus Zathura survives the early part of the film where hes obliged to be restless and annoying and emerges as an acceptable young hero. The film gets a big boost from Briem a young Icelandic actress who is both angel-cool and sorceress-hot. (Shes for the target kids older brothers.) Her role is a rare one for this sort of film a woman as resourceful as the males but with no agenda to humiliate them. But neither the acting nor the story matters much here; the movie is simply the sum of its 3D effects. In recent years some upscale films notably Robert Zemeckis Polar Express and Beowulf have been available in 3D. Yet for a viewer to put on those glasses still as cumbersome a visual appliance as they were in the 50s is to surrender to cheesiness. (I tell moviemakers who want to work in the format get back to me when you invent 3D without specs.) So Journey which is emotionally sedate but determined to offer the full 3D experience finds every excuse to send stuff jumping out at you yoyos rocks dinosaur drool the works. When Trevor spits water into the sink youre the sink. The movie falls short only of theme-park 3D attractions like Walt Disney Worlds ""Honey I Blew Up the Kids"" where you get spritzed at the end. Journey also has a runaway-tram ride that will remind you of the one in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom but which Id like to think is a tribute to the roller-coaster ride in the 1953 movie This Is Cinerama (another gimmick process that premiered in the middle of the original short-lived 3D craze). The picture is multidimensional all right but not always visually persuasive. In a simple scene say where people talk in the foreground with shrubbery behind them the background seems like a process shot even when it isnt; the two planes dont blend to form a plausible movie reality. The process works niftily though in a scene where Sean must get across a bottomless chasm by climbing from one suspended stepping stone to the next. Sometimes a gust of wind blows a stone upside down and he must hang on as shards of the rock break off and fall into the camera. If at this moment the child next to you grabs your arm and hollers ""Duck"" the movie will have been worth the ticket price.

For complete movie listings and show times and to buy tickets for select theaters go to sfgate.com/movies.) Living at a time when any spectacle imaginable can be put onscreen action filmmakers have only their good taste to restrain them. Its so easy to dream up monsters and so hard to devise stories and characters. Add into the equation an audience that will flock to whatever makes the biggest noise - not to mention a critical community that often seems willing to lobotomize itself so as to get into the spirit - and it becomes a wonder that anything as satisfying and sensible as ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" ever gets made. No its not some earnest dud. ""Journey"" is a legit action movie with action sequences imaginative action set pieces and even one or two monsters. It has the wonderful gimmick of 3-D - still a gimmick after 50 years and still lots of fun - and it has some genuinely harrowing moments in which you may find yourself worrying about the characters and feeling almost as though youre sharing their adventures. ""Journey"" has the old-fashioned virtue of inciting things like fear and empathy (or pity and terror). Thats what it has. What it doesnt have are bad computer graphics or any scenes involving superheroes battling it out on a congested New York street. It has no scenes of people getting out of their cars to see what the commotion is only to go bug-eyed at the sight of two muscle-bound men fighting it out in the sky. Instead it has characters that are idiosyncratic enough to seem true with lives that are detailed enough so that the character development isnt perfunctory but essential to how the story unfolds. Starting out with classic material helps. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a loose adaptation of the Jules Verne novel set in modern times and featuring a professor (Brendan Fraser) who is thoroughly familiar with Vernes story. The professor goofy but capable is locked into a bland existence teaching small classes and trying to pass along the scientific ideas of his older brother who went missing 10 years ago. The brother a committed ""Vernean"" believed that Vernes ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" was not a work of fiction but rather a thinly veiled proclamation of scientific discovery. One day when seismic patterns are most propitious the professor sets out for Iceland with his teenage nephew (Josh Hutcherson). To get to a sensor to the top of a mountain he hires a guide played by Icelandic actress Anita Briem. But no sooner do they arrive at their destination than a thunderstorm precipitates an avalanche and they become trapped in a cave. This is where the leisurely buildup pays off. By the time the professor the nephew and the guide are trapped by 30 tons of rock their fate is not a matter of indifference to the audience. It no doubt helps that the professor and the guide are not the usual action-movie types. Fraser is eccentric enough never to be typical and the guide is not the usual annoyingly spunky (or spunkily annoying) American heroine. The screenplay doesnt degenerate into nonstop wisecracks. The filmmakers confident enough to trust that the story is interesting stay focused on the central predicament three characters stuck underground. Considering that the movie is called ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" it should come as no surprise that every time the three try to make their way to the surface they end up going deeper and deeper toward ... the center of the earth. This means various adventures not to be spelled out here but also some fantastic sets and in a lovely touch thats reprised throughout luminescent birds. Elements that would have been fun in two dimensions take on an extra kick in 3-D. Indeed director Eric Brevig could have leaned on the 3-D and the action sequences - he could have indulged himself and bloated his movie by 20 minutes - and still had something that would have pleased most viewers. Instead he told the story. When the story meant a terrific sequence involving someone jumping across an abyss from one magnetic (floating) rock to another he provided it. When it didnt he didnt try to fit one in. This is Brevigs first feature film. Before that he served as a visual effects supervisor or second unit director on a number of well-known movies. His restraint is admirable in a visual effects man but maybe thats not as rare as we might expect. ""Journey"" shows that Brevig knows exactly what visual effects can do - and more important what they cant. -- Advisory Danger and adventure but otherwise fairly wholesome family entertainment.

Journey to the Center of the Earth (PG) Warner Bros. (92 min.) Directed by Eric Brevig. With Brendan Fraser Anita Briem Josh Hutcherson. Opens Friday at theaters in New Jersey. THREE STARS With gas prices rising faster than the mercury plenty of budget-conscious families are curtailing their trips this summer. Well heres a penny-saving tip Theres an amusement park as close as your neighborhood theater. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is a new family-friendly version of the old Jules Verne story about an intrepid explorer who slips into a dormant volcano and ends up in the real middle earth. And its 3D effects -- shamelessly joyously indulged in by director Eric Brevig -- turn the whole movie into a ride. Lava carnivorous fish dinosaur mucus and yo-yos all come flying into the camera. A trip on a miners car turns into a hairpin roller-coaster ride; a sail across an underground sea is so full of pounding waves you can almost feel the spray. Its a giant Six Flags attraction minus the lines. The story itself isnt scrupulously faithful to the original -- actually youd get a closer sense of Verne from a Rick Wakeman album -- but it does it all with a wink. The movie you see is about someone who thinks the old French novel was actually nonfiction. After he disappears down a dormant volcano his brother -- and his son -- go looking for him in the company of a pert Icelandic mountain guide. And what happens then is -- well just refer back to the title. Brendan Fraser who became the go-to guy for family adventure with the first ""Mummy"" film (theres yet another coming out in August) is our intrepid volcanologist Trevor; Josh Hutcherson is his just-snotty-enough 13-year-old nephew. They both do pleasant easygoing work although the movie is thrown off by the casting of Anita Briem; she looks far too young to be a love interest for Fraser and the hint of a rivalry for her between uncle and nephew is just queasy. Thats a tiny and certainly out-of-character misstep for Walden Media which produced. It began to carve out a niche for itself a few years ago by doing family-friendly films based on solid literary properties; now that it makes the Narnia films for Disney it nearly has a monopoly. (""Bridge to Terabithia"" ""How to Eat Fried Worms"" and ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" were all Walden efforts.) Theyre all done with care and good taste and so is ""Journey."" Except for a very mild pun on the word ""schist"" theres no strong language and only two quick kisses. The one dead body encountered is kept offscreen; although the dinosaurs encountered in this version are infinitely scarier than the creatures in the old Pat Boone flick brave gradeschoolers should be able to handle them. Some adults may find this all a little too tame of course and sorely lacking in wonder. But for audience members who flunk the you-must-be-this-tall-to-take-this-ride test for todays ""Hellboy"" sequel -- definitely a 12-and-up experience -- ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" will do quite fine. It has a just-rebellious-enough kid just-goofy-enough hero a cute competent heroine and plenty of bumper-car chase scenes and house-of-shocks surprises. And if it tricks the kids into picking up an actual Jules Verne novel -- well then the real journeys can begin. Rating note The film contains some scary monsters.

PHOTO GALLERY Journey To The Center Of The Earth Director Brevig may not have a Spielberg-size budget to work with but he delivers at least as many family-friendly thrills as ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" in a remake rivaling the far more lavish 1958 Technicolor version of Jules Vernes classic starring James Mason and Pat Boone. This fast-paced edition moves the action to the present where Frasers Trevor Anderson is spending a couple of weeks with his sullen nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson). He hasnt seen much of him since Seans dad disappeared a few years back. Seans old man was a Verne buff and a signal from a geological sensor he placed in Iceland sends them off on a wild adventure there accompanied by a spunky local guide named Hannah (Anita Briem). The three of them descend into the bowels of the Earth where they encounter prehistoric beasts and other creatures after falling thousands of feet to the Earths center. No movie with a T. rex chase is shooting for authenticity but there are geologically plausible moments here and there. Not particularly the sequence where Sean surfs magnetic rocks that slowly turn over while crossing a yawning chasm with a pool of lava at the bottom. It makes for a terrific 3-D sequence in a movie that has lots of them though. Objects and even noxious fluids are hurled at the audience which was regularly ducking at the screening I attended. While I cant vouch for the 2-D version (which I havent seen) ""Journey"" has a couple of other things going for it besides the excellent effects. Unusual for this genre the script doesnt insult the audiences intelligence and it mercifully soft-pedals its message about the virtues of reading. Another plus is Fraser whose comic timing and talent for lending credibility to fantastic situations is a delight even in lesser efforts like the ""Mummy"" movies. Hutcherson and Briem (who amazingly is actually from Iceland) also give performances well above the norm. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" may not be stunningly original - it more or less copies the mining-car sequence from another ""Indy"" adventure - but its actually worth 14 which is what youll pay for a 3-D ticket in some theaters. JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH Fun for the whole family. Running time 92 minutes. Rated PG (adventure action scary moments). In 3-D at the Empire the Chelsea the Union Square others. lou.lumenicknypost.com MORE Lou Lumenicks Movies Blog Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Share this article Share thisFacebookTwitterGoogleWhatsAppEmailCopy Read Next WITTY MARITAL BLISS Read Next WITTY MARITAL BLISS Share Selection Trending Nowon NYPost.com 34774 Ex-NFLer wife fatally shot by teen in their home 21861 Why Hollywood babes are trying to bag a tech titan not a rock star 18027 14-year-old girl slit teens throat in hopes of getting 1st kill cops Now On Celebrate Arnolds 69th birthday with his beefiest vintage pics Eric Claptons girlfriends ex-beau busted on pot rap Orlando Bloom joins Andy Sambergs HBO mockumentary SEE ALL Page Six TV Lindsay Lohans dad says booze pics arent what they seem Lindsays sober claims Michael Lohan These celebs hang out where?

This update of Jules Vernes classic novel is for kids and tweaks the plot enough to avoid seeming fuddy-duddy. Science-fiction purists should be warned The movie echoing the books plot hinges on the idea that Vernes 1864 adventure was somehow based on fact.The movie adds a ""You are there"" element with state-of-the-art ""RealD 3-D"" which makes killer plants and spike-jawed beast-fish pop. Yes special glasses are handed out - theyre Ray-Ban style not retro cardboard - to help make the movies secondhand Spielberg chases and theme-park effects a bit more special though not by much. Brendan Fraser plays a scientist whose brother disappeared a decade earlier searching for the lost world of Vernes book. Saddled for two weeks with his now-fatherless nephew (Josh Hutcherson) he suddenly sees his lab gadgets show unusual seismic activity around the world which prompts a trip to Iceland. There they find a hiking guide (Anita Briem) whose father was also a believer of Vernes fantasies (a ""Vernian"") and through a warren of buried caves they find ... whatever. Lets just say at the Earths core there are sea serpents a T-rex molten lava and vicious Venus flytraps that Georgia OKeeffe would have loved. The cast hits the right notes. Fraser switching between affable good sport and heroic goofball clearly doesnt mind this stuff. He realized early on with ""George of the Jungle"" ""Dudley Do-Right"" and the ""Mummy"" movies that his B-movie build and persona is perfect for live-action cartoons. Hutcherson is a capable teen actor who deserves better than talking to glowing birds and Briem from Showtimes ""The Tudors"" and more importantly actually from Iceland is like a brainier Kirsten Dunst with some late-60s Britt Ekland thrown in. Theres a mine-car chase that owes a lot to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" and an exciting leap across floating rocks. The digital 3-D gives off some oomph though it mostly lends the otherworldly vistas a crisp View-Master look. In a summer when six scenes in ""The Dark Knight"" will utilize IMAX technology the scariest thing in ""Journey"" is that after 50 years 3-D movies biggest draw is still the old yo-yo-in-your-face trick. jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

By Colin Covert Star Tribune August 19 2009 -- 248pm New Line Cinema Star Tribune Brendan Fraser in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" New Line Cinema Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint Journey to the Center of the Earth"" would be a forgettable summer kiddie action movie except for the novel visual effects that make it a sight to see. ""Journey"" is the first fiction feature shot with new-generation digital 3-D cameras. There would be no reason to see the film if it werent stereoscopic; but in 3-D capable theaters its a through-the-looking-glass experience. A modern reworking of the classic Jules Verne adventure the film stars Brendan Fraser as Trevor a genial geology professor whose volcano lab is about to be shut down by the penny-pinching dean. Thats a personal outrage to Trevor who is carrying on research started by his brother Max who disappeared 10 years earlier hunting ""volcanic tubes"" that he believed would lead directly to the planets core. During a visit from Maxs bored bratty adolescent son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) Trevor finds data in Vernes novel of subterranean exploration that parallel his findings. With Josh in tow he embarks for Iceland to explore Maxs expedition site. There are no significant female characters in Vernes book but that was 19th-century France and this is Hollywood 2008. So we have the brave adventurous and capable mountain guide Hannah (Icelandic actress Anita Briem) along for the ride. After a cave-in traps them in a mine the trio find themselves in a world of jewel-encrusted caverns dinosaurs carnivorous plants and saber-toothed flying fish. The film has about as much plot as a log flume ride. The story is in the tour of the underground wonderland with Trevor and Sean playing baseball with the leaping prehistoric piranhas a T-rex chase and a runaway minecart sequence. What little character development arises between potholes and pitfalls comes from a silly cross-generational rivalry by Trevor and Sean for Hannahs affections. The jokes dont feel so much like they were written for 12 year olds as by 12 year olds. While the flesh-chomping fish close in Josh gets a cell-phone call from his mom the signal somehow penetrating 4000 miles of rock. ""We have a bad connection"" he cracks hanging up to continue the battle. Fraser does most of the dramatic work in what is essentially a three-character film. Hes charming and intrepid a more subdued version of the roustabout adventurer he plays in the ""Mummy"" movies. Hutcherson is a standard-issue TV tween delivering a performance that is camera-savvy rather than persuasive. Briem as frosty and eye-catching as her homeland is little more than action-girl window dressing. But the entertainment value of the proceedings never reaches zero thanks to the fluidly incorporated 3-D visuals. Sometimes theyre lovely (glowing neon blur birds that fly off the screen and into the auditorium) sometimes theyre just dumb fun (Fraser brushing his teeth and spitting the toothpaste at the sink drain seen from below) but theyre always worth a jump a gasp or a laugh. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is clean lightweight escapism with a top-notch gimmick. JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH  OUT OF FOUR STARS Rating PG for intense adventure action and some scary moments.

LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post Hollywood wisdom through the ages has always been that no technological innovation -- the transition from silent film to sound black-and-white to color hand-drawn animation to digital images -- could ever make a bad movie into a good one. Yet the three-dimensional breakthroughs employed in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" come close. In just two dimensions Brendan Frasers subterranean adventure to the planets midsection probably would play as what it is at its core A lame bit of hokum thats less a story than a theme-park ride. With crisp images and depth that makes you feel you could reach out and stick your hand into the middle of the action the movie projected in digital 3-D form actually makes that theme-park ride kind of fun. The trouble is there are nowhere near enough theaters yet equipped to project digital 3-D flicks in Hollywoods nationwide pattern of 3000- plus cinemas so most places itll play in two dimensions. Images of carnivorous fish leaping from an underground ocean right at the camera still may look cool in 2-D. But a shot from the perspective of a sink drain as Fraser spits out his toothbrush backwash into the lens -- effective and funny in 3-D -- most likely will just look weird when the extra dimension is taken away. In his directing debut veteran visual-effects supervisor Eric Brevig makes the most of the 3-D technology that uses two side-by-side digital cameras to simulate the perspective provided by the right and left eyes. Moviegoers must wear glasses but theyre of higher caliber than the flimsy cardboard ones used for old-time 3-D flicks. Audiences already have been treated to similar effects in recent Hannah Montana and U2 concert movies. This is not Jules Vernes sci-fi classic retold though the movie does use his book as a template. Essentially a three-character story the movie casts Fraser as absent-minded geologist Trevor Anderson who forgets his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) is coming for a visit. Trevors brother the boys dad mysteriously vanished years earlier on a field expedition in Iceland. Just as Sean arrives Trevor stumbles on clues left by his brother that lead him to believe Vernes fantasy novel actually was based on a real journey to the Earths center. So he takes the boy along to Iceland to follow his brothers footsteps. They meet up with local guide Hannah (Anita Briem) and the threesome almost instantly find themselves tumbling and racing through the planets interior encountering glowing birds ravenous sea creatures and a pasty-faced dinosaur. While there are gimmicky shots designed to make audiences jerk in their seats as things come at them in 3-D mode Brevig restrains the impulse to use the technology for too many cheap jolts. Generally the 3-D images are fashioned to make fans feel as though theyre sitting inside the movie rather than being assaulted by moving objects within it. This is a movie made solely as a thrill ride. But be warned The ride may not be too thrilling if you see it in conventional 2-D cinema so try to catch the 3-D version. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" PG for intense adventure action and some scary moments. 1 hour 33 minutes. Directed by Eric Brevig. Written by Michael Weiss.

By Peter Rainer July 12 2008 Save for later Saved Im old enough to fondly remember watching the 1959 ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" as a little kid so I should start out by saying that the new version in 3-D no less will never take its place in my heart. But Id be very surprised if this latest incarnation is a favorite of all the new little kids out there either.Not that its terrible. It has its modicum of suspense and Brendon Fraser who stars as intrepid professor Trevor Anderson - who does indeed journey to the center of the Earth - is his usual heroically affable self. (If this movie turns out to deliver another ""Mummy""-like franchise for him hes going to turn into a human action figure.)But shouldnt there be more of a sense of wonder to this project or else why attempt to once again reimagine the fabulous Jules Verne book? The 3-D angle seems almost an afterthought. As is so often the case in our movies now the special effects represent the substitution of technology for true imagination. The 3-D isnt all that stupendous and Im one of those people who love the process even when its subpar. The director Eric Brevig settles for fairly low-grade tricks like having Trevor gargle in his bathroom and then rinse out right into the camera. Whoa Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Much of ""Journey"" plays like a thinner version of an ""Indiana Jones"" movie - a series not noted for its stoutness to begin with. (One difference Trevor unlike Indy hates fieldwork.) Trevor is in search of his lost brother who years ago disappeared mysteriously while journeying centrically and takes along on his trek the brothers surly son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and equally surly Icelandic mountain guide Hannah (Anita Briem). Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Review Journey to the Center of the Earth In this version of Verne the book is itself a protagonist - a kind of field guide to Earths interior. This isnt the smartest of plot ploys since at every leg of the expedition we are clued to anticipate what comes next. The carnivorous plants and T-Rexes arrive boringly on cue. Also cued is the inevitable thawing between Trevor and Sean and of course Hannah - who nevertheless looks as if she would need a blowtorch to be fully thawed out.Heres the best advice I can give. About those 3-D specs If you keep them dont use them for sunglasses. Grade C+ (Rated PG for intense adventure action and some scary moments.)

"In 3-D Journey has proper effects - The Boston Globe Local Search Site Search Home Delivery HomeTodays GlobeNewsBusinessSportsLifestyleAamp;EThings to doTravelCarsJobsHomesLocal Search MoviesRestaurantsMusicTheater/ArtsTelevisionBooksCelebrity newsEventsGamesComics THIS STORY HAS BEEN FORMATTED FOR EASY PRINTING Home / Aamp;E / Movies Movie Review In 3-D Journey has proper effects Brendan Fraser is on the run in ""Journey to the Center of the Earth."" (sebastian raymond/new line cinema) Email|Print|Single Page| Text size - + By Ty Burr Globe Staff / July 11 2008 For a harmless ""Indiana Jones"" knock-off ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" has an awful lot riding on it. The new film - the umpteenth screen iteration of the 1864 Jules Verne sci-fi novel - is also the latest movie to try to take 3-D technology mainstream.Using plastic polarized glasses (rather than grandpas red-and-green paper specs) and filmed with a camera invented by James Cameron for his own 3-D spectacular ""Avatar"" (due in late 2009) ""Journey"" arrives in 800 US theaters that have been hastily fitted with the RealD digital projection system. The Regal Entertainment theater chain recently contracted with RealD for 1500 more. DreamWorks and Disney/Pixar have vowed that all upcoming animated films will be released in 3-D. The paradigm shift is upon us.What that immediately translates into is Duck you suckers - were throwing more stuff at your heads. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" is perfectly engaging in a low-rent Saturday-matinee way but when Brendan Fraser spits toothpaste at the camera about five minutes in you know the spirit of 1981s ""Comin at Ya"" - the silliest entry in the last major 3-D push - lives on.Fraser imports his amiable charisma from the ""Mummy"" movies to play Trevor Anderson a hapless scientist whose brother Max (Jean Michel Pare) disappeared while exploring volcanic tubes that allow access to the earths core. Max was a ""Vernean"" and so is Trevor He believes Vernes book wasnt speculative fiction but a Lonely (Inner) Planet travel guide.Hes about the only one. The heros teenage nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson the go-to sensitive toughie of recent family films) hasnt read Verne and can barely be pried from his Sony PSP after mom drops him off with goofy Uncle Trevor. He scoffs and so does Hannah (Anita Briem) the fetching Icelandic mountain guide who agrees to take the two to the last of Maxs tectonic sensors on a remote mountainside. There of course is the highway to hell Trevor has been looking for.Well its not hell but its almost as hot. After a tumble down the tube a rocketing ride in mine carts a plummet through a thin sheet of muscovite and another endless fall the three wind up in a center of the earth that looks like the worlds biggest unfinished basement. Which in a sense it is.Except that unfinished basements dont have bioluminescent songbirds and galloping T. Rexes. ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" sends Trevor Sean and Hannah traversing the core toward a hoped-for exit hole before rising temperatures vaporize them and it throws what Sean calls Vernes ""dangerous bits"" at them and us with regularity. Toothy prehistoric fish carnivorous plants rampaging plesiosaurs all put in an appearance and the movie buckets along with the pleasurable pause-eek-pause of an above-average theme park ride.The movie feels weirdly underpopulated though - a bare-bones approximation of epic splendor. The 3-D visuals almost all in unappealing shades of brown give the underground caverns clarity and depth but little weight; theyre painterly vistas with small humans daubed into a corner. The only scene that breaks through into magic comes early when the heroes fall down a vent is broken by rising water droplets that slowly coalesce to form an underground sea. For a brief moment were not sure which way is up and the disorientation feels delicious.The rest of ""Journey"" remains earthbound. There are worse places to be I suppose since the cast is good company and the action is steadily paced by Eric Brevig a special effects craftsman getting his first shot at directing. He uses 3-D mostly for ambience and he goes easy on the gotcha shots but theyre there of course since what 3-D movie would be complete without a yo-yo flying toward your head at high speed? (That bit Im guessing is a tip of the hat to the paddleball man in 1953s pioneering ""House of Wax."")""Journey"" is fun for the kiddies but it hardly represents an advance As before the gimmickry cant lift the boats of a threadbare storyline. What the proselytizers and the investors forget is that if the characters and emotions arent three-dimensional the rest of the movie will always look flat.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

"3-D-lightful remake worth the trip - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs 3-D-lightful remake worth the tripJuly 11 2008|By Michael Phillips TRIBUNE CRITICJOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH Next year at least 11 different 3-D pictures will compete for the pleasure of the company of your eyeballs. By the time James Camerons ""Avatar"" opens in December 2009 a spotty unreliable cinematic tradition may well have reached critical mass and found new ways to amaze and entice a mass audience. Or else the trend will fizzle and the studios will await the next technological breakthrough in digital 3-D projection the one thatll really put that lion in your lap and that lover in your arms as the posters for ""Bwana Devil"" so eloquently phrased it 56 years ago.Meantime as a little tide-over we have a reassuringly cheesy and wholly enjoyable new version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" starring Brendan Fraser and a lot of stuff aimed directly at your head.I cant tell you how this film looks in 2-D which is how the majority of the nations customers will partake of it. I saw it in 3-D. I liked it. Its dopey but I liked it. And its not out to 3-D you to death the way Robert Zemeckis ""Beowulf"" (a far more ambitious project) couldnt stop aiming all that stuff directly at your head every second of every scene. Spears axes Angelina Jolies digitized nekkidity -- it was a lot to take in.You want a lot from 3-D of course and ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" certainly complies. Whats it about besides journeying to the center of the Earth? Its about flying toothy piranhas leaping directly out of a vast underground ocean into your face. Its about the star of the ""Mummy"" franchise (neither of the first two recent ""Mummy"" outings were as entertaining as this picture by the way) goobing toothpaste spittle down a bathroom drain i.e. into your face with the viewers perspective being that of the drain. At one point someone zings a tape measure into your face the way that busker aimed a paddle ball straight at your noggin in ""House of Wax"" the most popular of all the 3-D attractions from the early 1950s.The 1959 version of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" the one starring James Mason and Pat Boone wasnt filmed in 3-D; that one had to make do with ""the incomparable magic of CinemaScope"" as Mason intoned in the 59 films trailer. The new ""Journey"" has even less to do with Jules Verne than the Pat Boone one did. It may have more to do with Jules Munshin than Jules Verne.The new one isnt much more than a series of theme-park attractions -- the three-track mine-shaft roller-coaster ride being the most blatant and zippy it is too -- dressed up as a film. No pretension or visual ambition here. Eric Brevig making his feature film directorial debut comes out of the visual effects and second-unit realms. Its too early to tell if he has real talent or simply a lot of technical facility. I suspect its both. The new ""Journey"" moves along (minus credits it runs less than 90 minutes bam-bam-bam) and it has a fairly lighthearted spirit considering all the flying fishy carnivores and the T. rex attack and the overall bam-bam-bam.Frasers scientist Trevor Anderson travels to Iceland with his surly nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson). There they hook up with the daughter of a devoted ""Vernean"" played by the Iceland-born actress (a good one) Anita Briem. The three make their way down into a volcano and soon enough they fall down down down and despite what we know about the center of the Earth -- the part about it being 9000 degrees Fahrenheit which is awfully hot -- there they go intrepidly braving one new green-screen and soundstage challenge after another toward the center of the Earth where the flying fishies and floating boulders and neon bluebirds of happiness roam along with the dinosaurs.You dont believe a second of it but its easy to enjoy partly because of the casting of all three leads (and theres hardly anyone else in the thing). Hutcherson who was in ""The Polar Express"" ""Zathura"" and ""Firehouse Dog"" among others is turning into a shrewd effective young actor. Briem plays everything with forthright honesty and shes charming without resorting either to ninnydom or Icelanda-vamp. Throughout Frasers innate sense of the ridiculous serves him well. You can take him just seriously enough as an action hero to make all his wry corner-of-the-mouth wisecracks sufferable. No one working in movies today brings more silly brio to green-screen CGI work. No one looks happier punching out a digital man-eating plant in 3-D.- - -MPAA rating PG (for intense adventure action and some scary moments)Running time 132Opening 1201 a.m. Friday in both 3-D and 2-D formats.Starring Brendan Fraser (Trevor Anderson); Josh Hutcherson (Sean Anderson); Anita Briem (Hannah Asgeirsson); Seth Meyers (professor Alan Kitzens)Directed by Eric Brevig; written by Michael Weiss Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin based on the novel by Jules Verne; photographed by Chuck Schuman; edited by Paul Martin Smith Dirk Westervelt and Steven Rosenblum; visual effects supervised by Christopher Townsend; music by Andrew Lockington; production design by David Sandefur; produced by Charlotte Huggins and Beau Flynn.

Its a decent if overly familiar and yawningly obvious compendium of look-at-me moments intended to show off the latest and greatest in stereo 3D filmmaking in which the same things shot twice more or less merged into a blurry single image and rendered almost-kinda-sorta-not-really lifelike through the polarized shades of the RealD glasses you get to wear (and keep). Its successful enough to merit further exploration into 3D filmmaking where till now the greatest advancement has been that well 3D no longer hurts your eyes as much as it used to. Seriously to the director and his team of assemblymen a pat on the back--look forward to what you come up with when blessed with a real screenplay a few more dollars for special effects that dont look for total shit and an actor who hasnt played against green screens for so long hes forgotten how to relate to people. Should be interesting.Till then were stuck with another in a long line of remakes of Jules Vernes 1864 novel--which hit its apex for those of us in our late thirties with the Saturday-morning cartoon and Rick Wakemans epic-length prog-rock retelling the first to do so in stereo. The new Journey is more or less a remake of director Henry Levins 1959 offering in which James Mason as precursor to both James Bond and Indiana Jones drags Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl down to a prehistoric art gallery stocked with assorted matte paintings and papier-mache sculptures that give the earths core a groovy lived-in vibe. Levins was a template for the innerspace sci-fi films of the late 50s and early 60s and here director Eric Brevig--a visual-effects coordinator finally taking his seat in the directors chair--is just tracing old footsteps with Brendan Fraser filling Masons sturdier boots.Oh but its in 3D this time--the best thing about which you can say is ""Hey no headache"" With a catering budget to cower his predecessors special-effects outlay Brevigs version still feels astoundingly less ambitious than Levins which made more with less. If the 3D here is better than average slightly the rest of the movie brings it way way down--not quite to the center of the earth but at least a good six feet under.Fraser about to appear once more shouting for his Mummy in a googolplex near you has completely forgotten how to speak to other actors; it no longer looks like the guys reading from cue cards but shouting from them. As Trevor Anderson a disheveled science professor mourning for a brother who died looking for the center of the earth Frasers so wide-eyed that hes blank-eyed marching from one scene to the next plot-plot-plotting along till whoops thats a mighty deep hole.The movie takes its time arriving at the earths core--theres another visitor to pick up love interest Hannah (Anita Briem) the Icelandic tour-guide-slash-model--and then rushes to escape from it almost in embarrassment. Theres good reason not to linger downtown All the filmmakers summon from their collective imaginations is a dingier version of Willy Wonkas chocolate factory replete with giant mushrooms and glow-in-the-dark birds that close up look like Mr. Bluebird escaped from Song of the South.Episodes of Land of the Lost were more inspired.

"Journey to the Center of the Earth a simple family-fun flick - Orlando Sentinel Planning a vacation? Check out the best travel deals and destinations Entertainment Entertainment Journey to the Center of the Earth a simple family-fun flick Roger MooreSentinel Movie Critic Journey to the Center of the Earth is cinematic sci-fi proof that the Earths core is made of cheese. Who knew?Mercifully its old-fashioned family-friendly B-movie cheese served up in this Brendan Fraser/Jules Verne action epic for kids. Seek out this Journey in a theater showing it in 3-D. Youll want the T-rex with his snapping teeth the bioluminescent birds the gigantic Venus flytraps and that mouthwash Fraser spits down his sink all right in your face. Or lap. This is 3-D the way it used to be -- playful used for effect but not really a technology that can lift a middling movie much beyond tolerable.Fraser stars as a Trevor Anderson a teacher of ""tectonics physics"" a man who has studied the deep geology of the Earth and its relationship to the drift of continents. His brother did the same. But Max that brother went missing 10 years ago. When Trevor baby-sits Maxs 13-year-old son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) they stumble across Maxs annotated copy of Jules Vernes Journey to the Center of the Earth. Max it appears was a ""Vernian"" somebody who took the 19th century sci-fi writers fiction as fact. And he disappeared looking for a way into the center of the Earth. So the lads race to Iceland to follow Maxs trail take up with a doubting and sexy Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem) and work their way into the planet through a volcano facing one crisis after another with one one-liner after another.""Dibs on the mountain guide""The Verne novel has been adapted every 20 years or so pretty much since the dawn of cinema. The fantastical notion of a primordial ""world within the world"" is irresistible as juvenile entertainment. The director one-time special-effects specialist Eric Brevig (he worked on Total Recall among other films) doesnt skimp on the spectacle though any movie set in caves and abandoned mine shafts -- time for a mine-shaft-cart roller-coaster ride -- is by definition an overdose of blacks browns and ahem ""Earth tones.""Fraser as he proved in the Mummy movies has a lightness to his performances that keeps this from turning tedious. The short running time helps too. Is it fantastic as film fantasy? Not really. But then if youve got anything in memory to compare it to its not for you. As a fun piece of kids sci-fi Journey has science and pseudo-science and cliff-hanging action all flung at you in those wacky 3-D glasses.Let this be your guide. ""If youre old enough to recall any earlierJourney to the Center of the Earth youre too old for this one."" Unless of course you need more cheese in your diet.

"Journey to the Center of the Earth | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth ) Journey to the Center of the Earth (United States 2008) A movie review by James Berardinelli Journey to the Center of the Earth is the first live-action feature to take advantage of the new digital 3-D technology. However in generating what amounts to a 90-minute theme park ride the filmmakers lost track of the need to tell a compelling story to supplement the eye candy. Despite taking its name from one of the most famous science fiction novels of all time Journey to the Center of the Earth is as weak when it comes to ""fiction"" as it is when it comes to ""science."" This movie is an overlong gimmick an opportunity for special effects whiz-turned-director Eric Brevig to ""wow"" an audience with his technical bravura. With 3-D a little goes a long way and in the absence of a legitimate script with credible characters the fun dries up long before the running time has expired. Brevigs film based on a screenplay credited to three writers is not intended to be a strict adaptation of the Jules Verne novel. Instead its more of a sequel. It postulates that the novels hero Professor Lidenbrock made the trip described in the book and related the details of that trek to Verne who recounted them in the novel. The characters in this movie - Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser); his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson); and their mountain guide Hannah (Anita Briem) - follow in Lidenbrocks path as they travel to the top of a mountain in Iceland that reveals tunnels leading deep beneath the Earths surface. Below they discover a prehistoric world where dinosaurs and man-eating plants exist. But its getting hot down there and the trio must find a way to escape before they are broiled alive. The absence of a villain means that the only conflict is between our heroes and their environment. Under normal circumstances this would not be inherently uninteresting but the films grip of physics is so confused that the rules display an alarming lack of consistency and change at the directors whim depending on what he needs for a particular scene to work. Normally Im tolerant of flaws like this in a movie but the so-called ""science"" on display in Journey to the Center of the Earth is so atrocious that it creates towering barriers to the suspension of disbelief for anyone knowledgeable about such things. Fortunately for New Line Cinema the majority of potential customers wont care. The films ""drama"" is as painful as its science. The bonding between Trevor and Sean is trite; neither is developed as more than a toy to play around in the 3-D environment. Hannahs role is to make Trevor look like an idiot and eventually provide some low-key romantic tension. Brendan Fraser tries to bring some of the charm he exhibited in The Mummy to this project but it feels forced. Trevor is neither likeable nor dislikeable; hes there to provide us with a human face as a means of entry into a world thats a cross between Jurassic Park and Land of the Lost. Ultimately Journey to the Center of the Earth is about spectacle so the characters and storyline are of secondary concern. The movie views them as if not irrelevant at least inconsequential. This is all about making the digital world come to life and having things jump out of the screen at us. The 3-D work is admittedly done very nicely but after 30 minutes (or so) of pretty images one starts to desire more. And the movie cant deliver. The experience of watching this film in old-fashioned 2-D while it would brighten the images a little (polarized glasses darken things) must be a hollow one indeed. Take away the 3-D and theres little remaining. Ten years ago I can recall standing in line at the Universal Studios theme park in Florida to see Terminator 3-D a twelve-minute sequel to Terminator 2 that was projected in 3-D. Technology has advanced so that now its possible to have essentially the same experience in any theater equipped with a digital projection system. However as with any visual effects tool 3-D should be applied in service of the overall production not vice versa. And thats where Journey to the Center of the Earth goes wrong. Like the virtual roller coaster ride we go on mid-way through the proceedings theres something critical missing. Seeing even in 3-D is not the same as feeling. And once a movie has lost the capacity to reach us on more than a trivial level whats the point?

Or Brendan Fraser spitting while brushing his teeth making you duck for cover. Of course you can have all the dimensions you want for the effects but it doesnt make up for a one-dimensional story. Journey doesnt quite fall trap to that but comes awfully close. Weve transitioned rather quietly into a new era of 3-D one in which it really does make the characters jump out of the screen and into your face. Its a fascinating experience particularly in a live-action film. But in Journey its more an exercise in gotcha moments than a storytelling tool. At times Journey seems less like a movie and more like a 3-D ride at a theme park particularly when for instance the characters ride little cars through a mine shaft on rails that are laid out suspiciously like roller-coaster tracks. That being said its a pretty fun ride. And it starts out promisingly enough. Fraser plays Trevor Anderson a professor and scientist whose brother Max went missing 10 years before. Now Trevors nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) is coming to visit. Seans mom brings along a few of Maxs belongings including his well-worn copy of Jules Vernes novel Journey to the Center of the Earth. Deciphering the scribblings in the margins Trevor decides that he and Sean must high-tail it to Iceland where they meet Hannah (Anita Briem) the daughter of a professor who shared Maxs interests. Trevor poses the question central to the story What if Vernes book wasnt fiction? Next thing you know theyre hiking up a volcano. Before long theyre inside it. And thats when the adventure really begins. Its also where the story despite the 3-D wizardry goes flat. There is a rather touching scene involving Max - Fraser is quite effective in it - but for the most part the film becomes one chase scene after another. Granted the effects are pretty cool but theyd be just as effective as stand-alone set pieces. That seems even more pronounced because for the bulk of the movie its just the three of them Trevor Sean and Hannah trying to find their way back to the surface of the planet and trying to stay alive while doing so. Fraser Anderson and Briem are all good striking an easy bond with one another after some perfunctory hesitations. But the real star here is the pair of 3-D glasses youre handed when you walk into the theater. With them Journey is a kick (if not much more). Without them its more a journey into mediocrity and thats a trip no one wants to take. Reach Goodykoontz at 602-444-8974 or bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Weiss; Release Date Wide 07/11/2008; Runtime (in minutes) 93; MPAA Rating PG; Distributor New Line Cinema Posted July 18 2008 -- 1200 AM EDT When I was a kid the 1959 Journey to the Center of the Earth with James Mason Pat Boone and a lot of slithery cool dinosaurs was one of my favorite movies to catch on Saturday-afternoon TV. It had a certain odd gravitas with its crew of explorers getting increasingly desperate in their attempt to survive. (The sight of an actor as refined as Mason running around in rags was a shock.) The new Journey to the Center of the Earth whether or not you see it in 3-D has about as much gravitas as a helium balloon. Brendan Fraser as a floppy-haired academic looking for holes in the planet takes his 13-year-old nephew and a pretty Scandinavian guide along with him and the three never stop moving -- rocketing around on diamond-mine carts; plunging through a muscovite floor and falling down down down; scurrying away from a T. rex (him again) and other familiar terrors. Last years Beowulf employed 3-D with a certain fairy-tale savvy but Journey is just the new version of a 1950s comin-at-ya roller coaster with a tape measure trilobite antennae and giant snapping piranha thrust at the audience. Yet wandering around the earths stalactite-dripped core exerts a primal appeal even in a dumb kiddie joyride like this one. In the best scene Frasers nephew clings to floating magnetic rocks above the deepest abyss youve ever seen a situation that could give even jaded videogame kids vertigo.

Entire Site Magazine Blogs Search Listings Restaurants Bars amp; Clubs Events Hotels Movies Museums amp; Attractions Spas amp; Beauty Services Stores The Movie Review The War Zone at Home ShareThis Journey to the Center of the Earth in which morose hunky scientist Brendan Fraser his nephew (Josh Hutcherson) and a blue-eyed Icelandic babe (Anita Briem) roller-coaster down a mine shaft fall into a chasm and get chased by dinosaurs is clunkier and more simpleminded. It would be barely passable under normal circumstances but in 3-D its a circus of excellent FX. You get the always-good-for-a-laugh yo-yo-in-your-face some spat-out mouthwash many sharp objects snapping dino jaws a cute little bluebird and even monster pus. With the glasses on the image is a little dark and the underground oceans and forests look fakey fakey. But who cares when the background is actually back and the foreground so fore it seems to tickle your nostril hairs? If todays movies take place inside computers anyway its nice when the technology can usher us inside too. In The Wackness Josh Peck of Nickelodeons excruciating (for non-tweens) sitcom Drake amp; Josh plays a recent high-school grad who wheels around an ice-cream cart selling pot some of it to his long-haired stoner psychiatrist (Sir Ben Kingsley) while lusting after the doctors willowy stepdaughter (Olivia Thirlby). The writer and director Jonathan Levine labors to establish the period (its 1994) which means a lot of white kids talking like rappers and ominous signs (for drug dealers) of a Giuliani crackdown on New York crime. The movie feels autobiographicalemotionally authentic (with a fair amount of bitterness toward women) and somewhat unshaped. The Giuliani stuff doesnt come to anything and Peck needs to learn that even dazed-and-confused teens dont let their mouths hang slackly open all the time. The fun is watching Thirlbysecond banana in Junodo a tantalizing sex-bomb number and Kingsley get to flout his knighthood by sticking his tongue down the throat of Mary-Kate Olsen. The big film opening of June was the latest Pixar triumph Andrew Stantons Wall-E which screened too late (Why Disney why?) to be reviewed in this magazines double issue of two weeks back. You can read my full paean to its beauties here but its worth restating the thesis that the movie is essentially a parable of two children Wall-E and Eve who restore the connection between humans and the natural world. Pixar a beacon for the future of film technology has defined itself by telling stories of loss decay and the dark side of materialism with a tension between childhood wonder (inspired by old toys cars movies) and the disengagement brought on by growing up in a fast-paced cyber world (CG-ennui anyone?). Its as if simple machines hold memories that aging humans forget. What a peculiar company this is forward- and backward-looking a technological Janus head using all its computer resources to warn us that computers are stealing our souls.

With a principal cast of only three the new 3-D ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" probably has the highest screams-per-capita ratio in the history of action-adventure pics and a better thrill-per-minute deal than most. Visual-effects vet and debuting helmer Eric Brevig makes clever use of the 1864 Jules Verne novel and its fantastical subterranean wonderland and fortunately has on hand thesp Brendan Fraser -- whose mission in Hollywood seems to be to humanize the most f/x-besotted adventure. Boisterous action 3-D visuals and equal doses of humor and chills should rocket the deep-dwelling tale into strong B.O. orbit. From space travel to submarines the writings of French sci-fi pioneer Verne predicted much of what would be discovered and invented in coming years. But ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" was uncharacteristically wrong about ... well everything but especially the Earths interior which Verne imagined as a realm of dinosaurs and secret oceans and a maze of natural phenomena. Henry Levins 1959 adaptation featured pop idol Pat Boone (singing and shirtless) an operatic Arlene Dahl and the campiest-ever performance by the great James Mason. Levin moved the story from Hamburg to Edinburgh added a subplot in which the explorers were being pursued by rivals and otherwise followed the Verne-ian itinerary -- heroes enter the Earth in Iceland experience the terrible the perilous and the prehistoric and emerge happily in Italy. Following a mercifully updated script by Michael Weiss Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin Brevig puts the Verne book itself in the hands of hero Trevor Anderson (Fraser) an American professor and seismological prophet whose brother Maxwell disappeared mysteriously some years earlier. When Maxs son Sean (Josh Hutcherson) -- predictably a miserable materialistic and bored adolescent -- comes to visit for 10 days he brings along a box of Maxs papers. Inside is a copy of ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" with notes indicating Maxs Verne-ish theory that volcanic tubes -- bypassing the magma one would expect to find below the surface -- could provide entree to the core of the planet. Like every ""Journey"" hero Trevor impulsively drops everything and heads for Iceland taking along the 13-year-old hes supposed to be babysitting. Fraser is an interesting commodity Good-looking charming and possessed of great comic timing he seems capable of doing it all (see ""The Quiet American"") and is certainly a refreshing ingredient in ""Journey"" which could have dispensed with humanity altogether in its headlong pursuit of CG pyrotechnics. What the film needs -- the book had it and the 1959 film had it inadvertently -- is humor which Fraser provides. Thats a lot more than one gets from the stiffly Scandinavian Anita Briem who looks beautiful much like a glacier. Conveniently Briems character Hannah is a mountain guide whose late father was like Max a ""Vernian"" -- someone who believed Verne was writing fact rather than elaborate fiction. Hannah finds this all very embarrassing but agrees to take Trevor and Sean to the mouth of the volcano for 5000 kroner a day. One anticipates the frostiness between Trevor and Hannah will thaw which it does as Sean looks on with adolescent envy/yearning/disgruntlement. But it takes a while. In the meantime the trio perform alternately dangerous and ridiculous feats of derring-do -- jumping into a couple of handcars on a decrepit mining rail line by which they plummet miles below sea level to a jewel-encrusted cavern floored with fragile muscovite. This of course collapses spectacularly after several seconds of will-it-or-wont-it sending our heroes to even greater depths. There they find carnivorous plants ""Alien""-like fish and Tyrannosaurus Rex. Who knew? What ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" emphasizes is how technology ends up dictating content Helmer Brevig seems compelled to remind us now and again that were in 3-D so something flies at our faces for no apparent reason except to justify the ad budget. Its ornamental gimmicky and wholly unnecessary in a film where the narrative and 2-D effects would have been absorbing enough on their own. A more unavoidable obstacle here is that theres not much in the way of plot -- the story is in the tour through the labyrinthian intimacies of inner Earth. As such its an f/x wizards dream and Brevig makes the most of it. Production values are first-rate.
