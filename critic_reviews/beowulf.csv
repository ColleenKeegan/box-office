To get them theyve got to slay Grendal (Crispin Hellion Glover) the whiny and over-sensitive demon with the peeling skin whos been chewing up the skulls of King Hrothgars (Anthony Hopkins) men. Which means bludgeoning IMAX 3D with spears and severed legs and fountains of blood hurtling toward your magic glasses. In a perfect world the soundtrack would be Manowar (""Black Wind Fire and Steel"" was made for a shot of Beowulf bursting through the eye of a monster). But the Norse fighters dont want to hear songs about glory they want to inspire them and thus gain historical immortality--if only Bill and Teds time machine could plunk the actual Beowulf before Robert Zemeckis bombastic tribute. Those who remember the 3000 line epic from 8th grade English will be pleasantly surprised to learn theyve scrapped the original plot altogether. The traditional epic was episodic and cold; here Zemeckis struggles for a cohesive theme about mans inability to control their inner demons of hubris and lust mainly because the latter means that in this version Grendals beastly mother can be prettied up as Angelina Jolie with a tail and cloven foot high heels. Like in an XXX movie she caresses his sword until it explodes into hot liquid metal. Writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary still cant keep the epics new intention from falling flat and the layered animation is more unnerving than spectacular. Instead of 300s dramatic beauty the cartoonists invest energy in giving everyone nose hairs and wrinkles--though Beowulfs lacy scars are a bravo touch--and in moving them around the Danes piles of gold bullion as if they were the awkward robots of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride instead of broad shouldered warriors with axes to grind on the nearest creatures head.

"Review Exciting Beowulf jumps off the screen - CNN.com Share this on Mixx Facebook Twitter Digg delicious reddit MySpace StumbleUpon Review Exciting Beowulf jumps off the screenStory Highlights ""Beowulf"" best seen in IMAX 3-D where its effects shine brilliantly Film based on old English epic of warrior facing off against monsters Movie exciting -- but probably too much for children Next Article in Entertainment >> By Tom Charity Special to CNN (CNN) -- History is repeating itself. More than 50 years ago Hollywood embraced big-screen formats (CinemaScope VistaVision) and 3-D to protect the movie business from television. Now with the box office under threat from at-home viewing industry watchers have noted spectacular returns for features released on the large-screen IMAX circuit. Beowulf takes on the monster Grendel -- and then has to face Grendels mother. So though its also going out in conventional theaters theres no question that Robert Zemeckis envisaged his CGI-animated epic ""Beowulf"" for IMAX 3-D. (Zemeckis knows the value of IMAX -- the formats biggest feature-film hit is his 2004 film ""The Polar Express."") When it comes to riding a golden fire-breathing dragon into a blizzard of oncoming arrows a bootleg on your desktop just isnt going to cut it. ""Beowulf"" the original action-adventure yarn -- its the oldest epic narrative verse written in the English language dating back to the eighth century -- has been spiked with enough risque business and healthy splatterings of gore to make it unsuitable for kids (the rating is PG-13). But its a full-on feast for the rest of us exciting and even exhilarating at times with considerably more shading than the bloody ""300."" Theres precious little poetry in this free adaptation by screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary but their sharp spin on the story puts a psychological face on the ancient fable. The story concerns the title warrior who arrives in Denmark in the year 507 to do battle with Grendel a giant pustulant suppurating demon that terrifies the Danish court whenever theyre in their mead cups which is often. Beowulf is voiced by Ray Winstone whose motion-captured alter ego is a buff blonde who looks more like the young Sean Bean. If theres something irritatingly cocky about a Geat who strips naked to fight a supernatural being on equal terms (Zemeckis goes to ""Austin Powers"" lengths to hide Beowulfs manhood) his adversary is a curiously sympathetic figure resembling a refugee from Gunther von Hagens Body Worlds exhibition. Sure Grendel has an anger management problem but then he is stuck with appallingly noisy neighbors egged on by a beer-bellied Dionysus King Hrothgar the demons own dad (Anthony Hopkins whose paunch is one 3-D effect too many). Beowulf wins this bout but hasnt reckoned on tackling the monsters mum (Angelina Jolie also semi-tastefully au naturel). If theres something perverse about assembling a cast like this (Brendan Gleeson John Malkovich and Robin Wright Penn are also on duty) only to coat them in a kind of cosmetic digital wax the actors personalities do come through and the facial rendering is less creepily plastic than in ""Polar Express."" In as much as Beowulf himself is capable of nuance -- doubt shame regret as well as courage -- its there on screen right along with his rippling biceps and his nasal hair. Only the dull and robotic eyes give the game away. So is this the future of cinema? ""Beowulf"" is an excellent showcase for the advantages of computer-generated animation. When Grendels mother emerges from the slime as the delicately airbrushed Angelina her feet are cloven stilettos and her long ponytail curves behind like a dragons tail. Its quite a costume. (And if La Jolie isnt feeling quite so pretty one day presumably her motion-controlled simulacrum could extend her prime for as long as audiences care to watch.) As with traditional animation if the economics are right CG seems a good fit for larger-than-life stories comic book adaptations sci-fi horror and myth. Its a significant chunk of the market. But dont bet on the 3-D portion of the equation staying the course. Its fun to see the Paramount logo and feel like you could start climbing that mountain but after weve been poked and prodded by spears and swords escaped falling masonry admired heaving bosoms and plunged into icy depths the novelty becomes a distraction. The glasses have improved but not enough. Theyre still an encumbrance and you get ghosting and blurring along with your lap dance. And oddly 3-Ds biggest flaw is false perspective. Too often figures stick out against the landscape like cardboard cutouts in a pop-up book. In a pagan spectacle like ""Beowulf"" that can be passed of as part and parcel of the pageantry; but in the hands of a less skillful storyteller it could soon become a pain in the (flat) behind. But ""Beowulf"" mostly delivers on its promise. Expect long queues at specialized screens and more exhibitors jumping on the technology in time for James Camerons ""Avatar"" in 2009. ""Beowulf"" is rated PG-13 and runs 113 minutes. For Entertainment Weeklys take click here.

Comments Beowulf ""It was one of those horrible assignments"" says director Robert Zemeckis echoing every schoolkid whos ever suffered through the eighth-century epic poem. Translating the Old English into New Multiplex Zemeckis uses the motion-capture animation of The Polar Express to integrate his actors with the poems awesome monsters though the stars (Ray Winstone as Beowulf Anthony Hopkins as King Hrothgar Crispin Glover as a wailing Grendel Angelina Jolie as his va-va-voom mother) arent particularly well served by their doll-like incarnations on-screen. The bolder stroke comes from screenwriters Roger Avary (Pulp Fiction) and Neil Gaiman (the graphic novel Sandman) whove turned the arthritic legend into sort of an Arthur Miller play in chain mail. Their story arc brings some legitimate dramatic interest to Beowulfs climactic battle with the dragon though it also calls to mind that classic screen credit for The Taming of the Shrew (1929) ""By William Shakespeare with additional dialogue by Sam Taylor.""

Opens late tonight ""Beowulf"" with Ray Winstone Anthony Hopkins Angelina Jolie John Malkovich Robin Wright Penn. Directed by Robert Zemeckis from a screenplay by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary. 114 minutes. Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence including disturbing images some sexual material and nudity. Opens tonight after 9 p.m. at several theaters including Cinerama. Showtimes. If youve been grumbling lately that Hollywood doesnt make enough semi-animated Middle Ages epics featuring monsters who drool in 3-D ""Beowulf"" just might be the movie for you. Grendel a horrific creature whose appearance seems inspired by all those scary photos you see in dermatology textbooks is the demon at its center and the warrior Beowulf who likes to coyly shuck off his chain mail and fight au naturel (always with a conveniently placed ahem sword) the brave mortal come to slay him. Sound familiar? Yes this is the Old English poem most of us read in high school and promptly forgot about. Director Robert Zemeckis however seems to have remembered it and has reimagined it (with the help of screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary) as a showcase for the digitally enhanced live-action format he used in ""The Polar Express."" Essentially actors give their performances before cameras with numerous sensors attached to their faces and bodies. The captured performance goes into computers where it is tweaked and twisted and doctored up in mysterious ways. Audiences watch the film in 3-D donning plastic glasses and quizzical expressions. The end result is a movie that looks sort of like live action except that the characters look weird and walk funny. Its an odd tradeoff Isnt the movie industry crawling with actors quite willing to look weird and walk funny for far less money than all those computers must cost? And didnt it dawn on Zemeckis that his film looks more than a little silly which distracts from all that good-vs-evil gruesome battle action? Or that when you put Angelina Jolie into a movie like this the audience immediately wonders what on earth Lara Croft is doing naked in a pool of water in ancient Denmark? Theres not much history here; just a lot of mead-swilling and belching (yes apparently computers know how to do that) before the monster shows up and wreaks havoc with Beowulf appearing shortly afterward. ""We are geeks I am Beowulf"" he announces grandly and its only due to some post-screening Wikipedia searching that I know that Beowulf was a Geat (a Germanic Swedish tribe) and that the line as I heard it was much funnier. Beowulf is heroically voiced by Ray Winstone a fine actor who bears little resemblance to the extremely buff and frequently naked warrior shown here. (In cineplexes around the country this weekend in-the-know audience members will be murmuring sagely ""Thats not Ray Winstones butt."") Jolies character Grendels scary/sexy mother also scorns clothing revealing a nifty pair of cloven stiletto heels that would be all the rage on a pre-medieval ""Sex and the City."" Theres nothing remotely like ""Beowulf"" in theaters at the moment so Zemeckis and crew get points for originality. And its certainly entertaining though perhaps not entirely in the way intended; often due to the casts thicket of accents. (""There shall be no singing or marinating of any kind"" thunders Anthony Hopkins King Hrothgar to his people. Did he mean merrymaking or was he just decreeing that everyone would eat dry meat and learn to like it?) Ultimately ""Beowulf"" feels a lot like a video game blown up large noise action and funny walking intact.

A fierce dragon terrorizes Beowulfs kingdom in Beowulf. Photo Paramount Pictures Beowulf 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Look its been a while since I last read Beowulf so maybe English poesy scholars can help me with a minor detail. Did Grendels mother have nipples or not? In this newfangled computer-enhanced movie adaptation she doesnt have any. She does have Angelina Jolies curvaceous bod which shows up nude (minus some other ahem defining features) in a few moments of Wild Things-style liquid seduction. Watching this scene -- watching almost any scene in Beowulf -- one easily pictures director Robert Zemeckis and writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary hashing out the delicate calculus of How Much to Show and still get that coveted PG-13 rating. Breasts are OK. Crotches so long as they arent really specific crotches are fine. A monster crunching on a sixth-century warriors head cool. Man hacking off his own arm through chain mail no prob. Anthony Hopkins lily-white digitized fanny priceless. Keep in mind the knighted fanny is in 3-D -- or it was in the Beowulf I saw. Three versions of the film open today one in the usual two planar dimensions two in a nifty-looking three (including full-blown IMAX which I didnt catch). Seeing it required a pair of blocky black Clark Kent spectacles and a stable digestive system which had to withstand the illusion of unsavory projectiles headed straight for my face. These included in no particular order rats spear points roast squirrel falling corpses severed monster arm spewing blood more falling corpses and a long string of translucent swaying demon spittle which just about brushed my lap. (You think youre feeling nauseated?) The narrative rationale behind these phantasmagorical gross-outs is the anonymous epic poem of yore which tells the tale of the hero Beowulf (Ray Winstone) and his legendary smackdown of the monster Grendel. In this reboot the wintry Danish countryside and everyone in it are rendered in an improved version of the ""performance-capture"" technique that first plasticized Tom Hanks in The Polar Express. The process which takes live-action footage and then shapes and buffers it digitally worked better in the Zemeckis-produced Monster House mainly because it made no effort at realism. That was a cartoon plain and simple. Beowulf isnt. Im not sure what it is or who its for (not kids). But its imaginative and it has the barreling forward motion and lurching thrills of a Dark Ages theme park even when its exercising battle-worn cliches -- even when it looks like a mythic manly Shrek thats soused on mead. Some of Zemeckis creative decisions make absolutely no sense such as encouraging Grendel (Crispin Glover) to mangle every line of dialogue beyond the point of aural recognition. I think but Im not sure that at one point he tells Mother the name of the fellow who attacked him. But all I could hear was ""Heeessss naooom wesss Bowwwullllv."" Grendel looks like one of those skinless cadavers touring the country in Body Worlds 3. Mom has a braided tail; for reasons I cant figure she speaks with a Hungarian accent. Beowulf I might add has the inflated musculature and minimalist fashion sense that turned 300 into an Abercrombie amp; Fitch shopping bag. But Winstone does his job which is to glower magnificently and say stuff like ""Mine is strength and lust and power I am Beowulf"" while wrestling Grendel in the nude. This isnt Eastern Promises -- we dont see Beowulfs central plumbing just his own slightly-less-lily-white backside. Some details are best left to the imagination at least in PG-13. amy.biancollichron.com Todays Deals Kids Jackets at Columbia Up to 70% off + free shipping Open-Box Wolfgang Puck 22L Pressure Oven for 70 + free shipping Banana Republic Extra 50% off sale items + free shipping w/ 50 Better Life Technology Garage Floor Cover for 130 + free...

At major theatres. 14A  Heads roll arteries gush and spleens spill across the IMAX screen in Beowulf just as youd expect in a screen adaptation of the oldest surviving epic poem in the English language.Article Continued BelowBut things really get down to business when the 3D eyeballs stare down the cleavage of a magnificently endowed wench. It becomes clear that the movie - excuse me the ""unparalleled immersive experience"" - is not your grandfathers Beowulf. Or your fathers Beowulf. Or your own Beowulf.This is a good thing in the rude fashion of a burp after a banquet. The ancient tale of Scandinavian kings heroes and monsters that has forever vexed schoolboys for its painful stretches of tedium its nonsensical rhymes and logic gaps and its damnable Old English - the thing was written on shaved leather for crying out loud - has finally been whipped into something resembling a gripping yarn.One with an ample amount of sex and nudity - tamed and sanded for mainstream sensibilities - that somehow had eluded generations of scholars including none other than J.R.R. Tolkien the hobbit master himself.Screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary no strangers to graphic scenes and pulpy fictions have taken liberties with Beowulf that make sense within the gilded exertions of this Robert Zemeckis-directed production.Making sense however is not the same as making great art. No one should consider this Beowulf anything more than a bizarrely entertaining hybrid of styles sort of like Classics Illustrated on steroids.The digitally enhanced humanity Zemeckis first employed to dubious effect in The Polar Express makes his Beowulf seems like Shrek with fewer laughs (some unintended) or 300 with less male bonding.Witness the frankly astounding choice of Ray Winstone as the title hero who comes from Sweden to save neighbouring Denmark from the ravages of a child-like monster named Grendel (voiced by Crispin Glover and looking like a giant boiled version of elf Dobby from the Harry Potter movies).Winstone is a British actor best known for playing blue-collar louts and gangsters. A man of ample girth and with a face remodelled by fists he would never be confused say with Viggo Mortensen. Especially when he opens his mouth and Cockney English comically spews forth as when he informs Danish King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) that hes come to fight the ""mon-stah.""And just try to resist chortling over exchanges like thisHrothgar ""Hows your father?""Beowulf ""Dead.""With this as a starter what do you do for an encore? How about Angelina Jolie as the Playboy centrefold from hell as naked as a jaybird yet with all of her naughty bits buffed like Barbie? Its all eyes on Angelina during her relatively brief scenes in the movie playing Grendels vengeful mother even more so than for the vaunted 3D effects that are more gimmick than grandeur.Might Beowulf have worked just as well as a regular live-action movie as Sturla Gunnarsson demonstrated in Beowulf amp; Grendel two years ago? When youve seen one axe flying through a skull youve seen them all although video gamers - an obvious target demographic - might disagree. The digital airbrush also does no favours to the films female characters apart from the rapturously rendered Jolie. Robin Wright Penns Queen Wealthow and Alison Lohmans man-stealing hussy Ursula look like they were sculpted out of plasticine. The male figures in contrast look almost photo-real right down to the liver spots.Its not until the big dragon comes out to fight that the 3D and digital wizardry really pay off. The message of this Beowulf? Mind your monsters and dragons lads but be very very afraid of women.

Thats how Hollywood turns a Danish warrior from an eighth-century Old English epic into a movie hero. Deep-voiced announcer ""Hes big. Hes bold. And hes boastful... Hes Beowulf."" Some critics have already chided Robert Zemeckiss new animated feature written by Roger Avary and Neil Gaiman for insufficient fidelity to its fabled source. I have to confess I cant remember even sleeping through the poem in high-school English class. So my only ignorant criterion has to be Is Beowulf a good movie? On this exam mark Y for Yes. Its got power and depth and two kings whose greatness is diluted by hubris and a thrilling dragon fight and the demon Grendel as a tortured outcast and a naked monster who looks a lot like Angelina Jolie. In their use of ""performance capture"" a technique that fans of traditional animation view with the sternest skepticism the films makers have managed to show more acute behavioral emotion as well as some fantastic images uncapturable in live action. You want to read Beowulf? Get the book Im not stopping you. You want bloody adventure with a brain see the movie. The story will be familiar even to those who dont know the poem. The kingdom of old Hrothgar (voiced and modeled by Anthony Hopkins) is troubled by the predatory sorties of Grendel (Crispin Hellion Glover). Accompanied by his ""14 brave thanes"" Beowulf (Ray Winstone) comes across the sea to slay the monster and not incidentally add another laurel to his own legend. He repels a Grendel attack on Mead Hall severing the beasts arm. Grendel limps back to his lair where his mother -- she has no name so well call her Grendma -- watches him die. When Beowulf discovers the lair Grendma reveals herself in the form of a beautiful seductress (Jolie). He returns to Mead Hall declaring that he killed both monster and mother but displaying only Grendels head. Many years later when Beowulf has succeeded Hrothgar as king his land is threatened by a dragon. Now Beowulf must vanquish one last monster. And this time its personal. The movie is opening today in two formats 3-D in 650 IMAX theaters 2-D on another 2500 screens. IMAX is the way the movie was conceived and the way to see it. Not only because stuff is hurled out at you but because being surrounded by the huge screen focuses your attention on the story. Sorry but those special glasses are mandatory. Back in the 50s when Hollywood made a couple dozen 3-D movies skeptics said that kids would never go for the cellophane and cardboard polarized glasses (one eye with a red filter one with a green) because they knew that bullies laid the ""four eyes"" taunt on the visually impaired. Glasses over your glasses would make you ""six eyes."" The 3-D fad died out in a few years but it took ages for the technology to improve. As recently as 2005 those same cheesy specs were handed out at screenings of Robert Rodriguezs The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D. The glasses at 3-D attractions in theme parks were a little less ornery and more advanced as were the ones used for Polar Express -- an apt title by the way considering the polarized glasses used. Arriving at Beowulf is still like visiting the optometrist the movie screen is an eye chart with pictures instead of letters. But the glasses are kinda cool like wrap-around Ray-Bans -- larger because the IMAX screen fills most of your field of vision and less distracting than the old kind. Just dont tilt your head; suddenly everything gets blurry. That might be a blessing in the early scenes which have as much peeing and belching as a PG-13 rating will allow and where the strangely Shrekish-looking Hrothgar staggers about drunkenly in a toga that is ever in danger of slipping off his mammoth body. It also takes a while to grow accustomed to the faces of Hrothgar his wife Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) and the oily counselor Unferth (John Malkovich). The faces have lines and creases but they dont look lived in. This quibble subsides when Beowulf appears. The political drama of the palace is instantly amped up to mythical stature and we can start appreciating the film for what is is a live-action cartoon. But with pathos as much for monster as for man. Grendel is a horror a plague to Hrothgars kingdom but he seems plaintive lonely in his cave. He complains to his mother in some Scandivanian tongue as if Gollum had shown up in a Bergman film. Up close he has the physiognomy of Rondo Hatton the actor whose acromegalic face got him roles as villains in 40s mysteries and horror films. Grendel too seems typecast for villainy but maybe the humans just dont understand how close he is to them. Why they might be kin. Similarly Beowulf is a flawed hero. His bravery and resourcefulness in battle are unquestioned but hes a bit too comfortable as his own legend-maker. In an attack by the Frisians he humiliates one warrior but doesnt kill him; ""Give him a gold piece and send him home. He has a story to tell."" Before confronting Grendel he strips himself naked. (Battling in the buff is a major motif this year in 300 and Eastern Promises.) As Beowulf leaps from one end of the Hall to the other the movie treats you to more cutesy-poo hide-the-penis shots than in Barts skateboard ride in The Simpsons Movie. His ego also gives him a weakness for the ladies. Once he becomes king he marries Hrothgars widow but keeps a younger blond (Alison Lohman) on the side. And in his showdown with Grendma hes simply out of his shallows. She appears to him drenched in gold with high-heeled feet and nipples pert enough to hang a horseshoe on. When her hand touches Beowulfs sword it turns to water even as his resolve melts away at her caress. Ulysses may have resisted the sirens but Beowulfs self-regard leads him to think he can bed Grendma and then best her. All of which leads to the illuminating observation that even a hero of legend is first and always a man. The kids arent likely to parse the fine points of the scripts psychology. They and their parents will be wowed by the battle scenes a nifty sea-monster montage and Beowulfs climactic dogfight with a dragon. No question you lose a little character nuance in ""character capture""; they dont look quite real. But the effects scenes look realer more integrated into the visual fabric because they meet the traced-over live-action elements halfway. It all suggests that this kind of a moviemaking is more than a stunt. By imagining the distant past so vividly Zemeckis and his team prove that character capture has a future. And Beowulf is a colorful pre-Christmas present.

Photo Paramount Pictures And Shangri-L Review Beowulf is back beefed up in 3D 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Beowulf Motion-capture animated adventure. Starring Anthony Hopkins Ray Winstone and Robin Wright Penn. Directed by Robert Zemeckis. (PG-13. 120 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Three-dimensional IMAX is an astonishing process that places the viewer inside the movie and the artistic possibilities are worth a whole discussion. In ""Beowulf"" even the credits are exciting The letters that form the title come flying over your shoulder and land on the screen about 5 feet in front of your nose. Call it a gimmick or call it the future of movies but its definitely fun and definitely worth experiencing sooner or later. For those who cant wait this movie will do as well as the next. As for ""Beowulf"" itself its all about the visuals which means that as soon as the novelty of 3-D wears off the experience has been had. That takes about 45 minutes and whats left is a motion-capture animation featuring a lot of sixth century drunks bellowing for mead interrupted by monster-fight interludes. Its the ""Beowulf"" saga once again and the movie becomes tiresome and trivial - well done within the narrow limits of its aspiration but not worth the inflated effort. To do ""Beowulf"" again there should be some reason to do ""Beowulf"" at all. In 2005 for example ""Beowulf amp; Grendel"" revisited the tale in order to present Grendel as a nice guy with his own point of view. That was a very bad reason to revisit ""Beowulf"" but at least it was a reason. With this film director Robert Zemeckis doesnt seem to have a clear purpose beyond exploring the technological possibilities of motion capture. He does that for sure. The spooky eye movements that characterized ""The Polar Express"" are gone and the movements of the animated characters look more natural than ever. Anthony Hopkins is the aging King Hrothgar a loud drunk who can barely stand up or keep his loincloth from falling off him. The role suits Hopkins in the sense that it gives him a chance to show how he has perfected the art of acting through grunts - ""ahh"" ""eeh?"" ""unhh"" Yet this king has a past and it catches up one night at the mead hall when Grendel shows up an emaciated ooze-dripping giant with a regrettable overbite and sinews and organs visible from the outside. It takes Grendel about five minutes to wipe out everybody but the principal characters and thus it becomes certain that a hero is needed. Enter Beowulf (Ray Winstone) who arrives by sea with the intent of killing the monster. Hes a big confident powerful man who kills monsters mainly as a means to expand his reputation. He lives for the sake of expanding his own legend. This is the one good idea of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avarys screenplay the notion that the heroes are conscious of their own publicity. The notion isnt explored or expanded enough to appreciably enhance the movie but it does provide the hint of a modern sensibility the beginning of a reason to re-examine the tale. The best scene in the movie has Beowulf intimidating and showing off for an enemy prisoner. When he finishes he tells a subordinate ""Give him a gold piece and send him home - he has a story to tell."" Along this same line Grendels mother in this version is not a hideous monster but a beautiful sea creature played by Angelina Jolie. While other Beowulfs had to contend only with external evil this movie suggests a more complicated test for the hero. He has to face something within himself the allures of fame sex treasure and glory. He has to deal with the soul-threatening challenge of becoming a big shot. But the handling of this notion is tentative and glancing and the real experience of the movie is in watching animated characters try to kill an animated dragon. The 3-D adds something to the experience but not enough to hold interest for the full running time. (I should say that I havent seen the 2-D version of the film and cant imagine the appeal of that at all.) ""Beowulf"" is an artistically unadventurous use of adventurous technology. Jean Renoir once said that the closer an art form gets to real life the further it goes from artistry and yet to see 3-D IMAX is to wonder how it might be to sit inside a live action comedy or drama. Think of your favorite movies. Would it be a good thing to be in the room with Rick and Sam in ""Casablanca"" or to sit at Harriet Anderssons bedside in ""Cries and Whispers?"" Maybe not. Maybe it would be as wrong as Renoir might have guessed. But Id like to see an ambitious adult movie made in this way before I decided. -- Advisory Animated nudity and violence.

Otherwise you will miss the full effect of the most visceral depiction of monster drool the cinema has afforded us a long slimy gob of medieval spittle that threatens to land on our unprotected heads. The monster as all English majors will know is Grendel whom the hero Beowulf slays in the oldest extant epic poem in the English--actually Old English--language. The spears that protrude from the screen are cool too but this is a special effect you know is coming its the archetypal 3-D money shot.Robert Zemeckis (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" ""Back to the Future"" ""Forrest Gump"") has always been on the cutting edge of new movie technologies. Here he lays 3-D on top of the motion-capture technique he explored in ""The Polar Express."" (Perhaps the most famous and successful example of motion capture is the computer-generated character Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy enacted by Andy Serkis.) Here Crispin Glover gets to play Grendel a grotesque misshapen giant whose skinless body resembles a nightmare version of a peeled anatomy in ""The Body"" exhibit. You wont recognize Ray Winstone either who plays Beowulf the stocky unglamorous brilliant British actor has been transformed into a buff blond superhero fond of shedding all his clothes at the slightest excuse. Other actors are instantly identifiable Anthony Hopkins as the dissolute old Danish King Hrothgar John Malkovich as one of his advisers and Angelina Jolie as Grendels shape-shifting mom. Though gold-plated like a Bond girl the naked beauty who rises out of the water to confront Beowulf (and who seems to speak with the accent she used in ""Alexander"") could only be Angelina. More disconcerting than her long serpents tail however are her feet which appear to take the form of very chic high heels. The kitsch soul of Zemeckiss movie is hilariously captured in that image.I can understand why Zemeckis who possesses one of the boldest most swoop-loving visual styles in Hollywood would relish the freedom motion capture allows him to send his camera sailing anywhere it wants to go. But the director who once used special effects to pointed thematic effect now seems to use them just for effect. The most interesting thing about ""Beowulf"" alas is its technology. Its the work of a man who has fallen in love with his toys but I miss the wicked satirist who made ""Used Cars."" And the truth is the motion capture in ""Beowulf"" comes across as an unsatisfying compromise between animation and live action. It distances us from the characters. A lot of people complained that there was something creepy about the dead-eyed humans in ""The Polar Express."" The eyes may be less dead in ""Beowulf"" but theres still something creepy about the technology its a little like the figures in a wax museum coming to life. Were meant to be moved by ""Beowulf"" which writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary have freely adapted and embellished from the 10th-century epic but did anybody ever weep over the tragic fate of a statue in Madame Tussauds? Gaiman and Avary have actually made some interesting extrapolations from the original and their vision of Beowulf as a flawed hollow Faustian hero ought to have more of an emotional kick. But Zemeckis has been seduced by the siren call of motion capture no less than Beowulf has had his soul snatched by Grendels deceptively beautiful mother. Memo to Zemeckis come back to earth Try Newsweek for only 1.25 per week At the extreme other end of the cinematic spectrum is Noah Baumbachs ""Margot at the Wedding."" Small in scope minutely focused on the emotional dynamics of a gaggle of neurotic urban characters shot in dark unslick images and wholly bereft of special effects Baumbachs closely observed tale of dysfunctional family relationships has the microscopic texture of a New Yorker short story and the darting spontaneous style of a French New Wave movie. But it too has a monster the title character played with jittery bravura and no emotional vanity by Nicole Kidman. Margot the mother of adolescent Claude (Zane Pais) is an unhappily married New York fiction writer who takes her son to the familys country home where her long-estranged sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) is about to be married. The groom the unemployed and unkempt aspiring artist Malcolm (Jack Black) is everything the skeptical Margot feared and shes not shy about sharing her feelings. Margot is one of those people who as soon as she spots the scab youre bearing will pick it off. Insecure passive-aggressive manipulative bossy thin-skinned shes a brittle nightmare but Kidman understands her so completely you also feel the characters torment Margot is smart enough to sense and be pained by the damage she wreaks. And she will wreak quite a bit before this misbegotten weekend in the country is over.Baumbach in his wonderful semiautobiographical ""The Squid and the Whale"" explored the malign impact an egotistical writer father (indelibly played by Jeff Daniels) visits on his children. Here its the intellectual mom who scorches the field. The cruelly funny ""Margot at the Wedding"" shares many of the virtues of ""Squid""--its psychologically astute sociologically dead on refreshingly unformulaic--but its a considerably tougher less ingratiating movie. People who insist on likable ""sympathetic"" protagonists may find it a bitter pill to swallow.Jennifer Jason Leigh (the directors wife) usually cast in fraught neurotic roles herself here gets to play the saner more benign of the two sisters (though Pauline has her flaky New Agey side) and shes wonderful. The push-pull love/hate relationship between these two sisters is captured in swift subtle strokes you can feel the years of built-up ambivalent feelings in their every gesture. Blacks loser fiance may be too pathetic for the movies own good--its hard to disagree with Margots judgment that Pauline is making a big marital mistake--and while you welcome the comic relief Black supplies the performance is stylized to the edge of annoyance. Zane Pais is a discovery as Margots sensitive son who adores his mother in spite of her sometimes withering disregard for his feelings. (You may be initially unsure as I was if the longhaired Pais is her son or her daughter so androgynous is his appearance.)""Margot at the Wedding"" is as personal as ""Beowulf"" is impersonal it follows its characters where they take the story with no concern for genre expectations. No swords leap out of the screen at you no great winged dragons are slain but the psychological battles it depicts draw deeper blood than anything Zemeckiss state-of-the-art computers can produce.Request Reprint or Submit Correction Join the Discussion Most Read (c) 2016 Newsweek LLC Please enter a valid emailAbout UsCorrectionsContact UsIBT MediaCareersAdvertiseCopyrightPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleArchiveRecent Issues SubscribeJuly 22 Issue Cop Killers Fatal Shootings of Police Are Rising Jeff Bezos Wants to Rule the World Can Mark Carney Save Britain From Itself?

Saturday November 17 2007 157 AM Beowulf. Epic tale of a warriors battles with demons and dragons. With Ray Winstone Angelina Jolie Anthony Hopkins. Director Robert Zemeckis (154). PG-13 Violence sexuality/nudity. Area theaters.English lit professors and students who suffered migraines studying the motifs themes and symbolism of the anonymously written Old English poem ""Beowulf"" may not cotton to the movie adaptation directed by Robert Zemeckis. But action fans cant complain.Shot in a much-improved version of the performance-capture process Zemeckis used for ""The Polar Express"" (2004) and being released in conventional 3-D and IMAX 3-D formats ""Beowulf"" is as dazzling a feast for the eyes as the hungriest eyes can take. It is as bloody and violent as it needs to be to capture the essence of its Dark Ages source and the monsters that the heroic warrior Beowulf must kill are spectacular computer-animated creations. The climactic battle between Beowulf and a napalm-breathing golden dragon will suck the air out of your lungs - at least if youre sitting in front of an IMAX screen as I was. Though others have attempted to adapt ""Beowulf"" on film its split structure - Beowulf fights the man-eating demon Grendel and his vengeful mother as a young man and the dragon decades later in another land - has deemed it ""unfilmable."" The script here overcomes the split by taking dramatic leaps that weld the sections together. Instead of killing Grendels mother - a wretched swamp hag in the poem a naked gold-plated Angelina Jolie in the movie - Beowulf (voice of Ray Winstone channeling Richard Burton) is seduced and corrupted by her. In exchange for her promises of his own kingdom he fathers another son for her and that son will become his curse - the dragon he must eventually fight to the death. Despite the storys new bridge theres still no middle to it. After Beowulf is compromised and inherits the kingdom from Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) we simply fast-forward a few decades barely alluding to the guilt that has estranged the hero from his queen (Robin Wright Penn) also inherited from Hrothgar. An even greater problem is that while the performance-capture process gives ""Beowulfs"" world a mythic quality it drains the characters of nuance. The movie may be three-dimensional but the people in it are not. For those Beowulf scholars already groaning out there theres even worse news The movie sets up a sequel.

A return to a time when men were men women poured the mead and pixels knew their place.What you get though is something unexpected an hour of violent subversive near-parody followed by a meditation on the seductions of power all wrapped up in a thrillingly vulgar blood-and-thunder 3-D comic book. Not all of it works - and not all of it works the way the target audience of jacked-up young males might want it to - but the movie is hugely provocative fun and Im pretty sure thats on purpose.First things first This is not the eighth-century epic poem you read in high school. Grendels mum that ""monster of women"" wasnt played by a purring Angelina Jolie even in the best-selling Seamus Heaney translation nor were the humans and beasties family trees entwined in ways worthy of a nighttime soap. Anonymous is doubtless rolling in his/her unmarked grave but hey whats oral tradition if you cant improvise a little? Or a lot.Second things second ""Beowulf"" is director Robert Zemeckiss latest attempt to make a feature-length movie using digital motion-capture a process in which actors movements are tracked on film via sensors attached to their bodies then ""drawn over"" using expensive computer-animation technology.In ""The Polar Express"" the result was a cast of zombie children and a creepy soulless Tom Hanks. The good news is that the technology has improved and that the cast of ""Beowulf"" merely looks like they have the squints. Occasionally they lumber about woodenly like Weebles with Actors Equity cards and the character of Queen Wealthow (voiced by Robin Wright Penn) does seem to be on loan from the DreamWorks Animation stable. At its worst the movie suggests ""Shrek"" on steroids.At its best though ""Beowulf"" dares to be absurd in ways that open the whole heroic-quest genre to weird playful scrutiny and it occasionally takes flight into the plain amazing. The screenwriters are the cult novelist/comics author Neil Gaiman and ""Pulp Fiction"" co-writer Roger Avary neither the sort of man to do what hes told. This is good for the movie if not for college Comp Lit courses.The setting at least is still Denmark in the early sixth century and Herot the hall of aging King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is still plagued by a rampaging monster named Grendel. Already you sense Zemeckis and his writers are up to something Hrothgar is a fat deluded Dionysus with Hopkinss face plastered on and Grendel who resembles the Frankenstein monster with his innards on the outside is voiced with piteous homicidal sympathy by Crispin Glover.Its a bad-neighbor issue I guess since the deafening revels in Herot have driven the noise-sensitive Grendel mad with rage. The first assault is terrifying with the monster rending Danes limb from digitized limb and eyeballs and other body parts regularly tossed at the screen (since many theaters are showing ""Beowulf"" in 3-D this falls under the heading of contractual requirement). Whoever rated the movie PG-13 should have their MPAA card revoked; I wouldnt let a child near the thing. Then comes Beowulf he of brawny demeanor with a cadre of rough tough Geats in his wake. The hero is voiced by Ray Winstone but drawn more or less like Sean Bean in ""The Lord of the Rings"" with additional blond highlights. Hes a braggart but the real deal even if Hrothgars sniveling second-in-command Unferth (John Malkovich) doesnt trust him and he quickly drops trou and prepares to battle Grendel in the nude.Why? Well its in the story - ""Cast off then his corselet of iron helmet from head"" and all that - but it also gives Zemeckis a way to goof on the posturings of sword-and-sandal movies. As Beowulf fights Grendel scampering this way and that over the great hall his private parts always obscured by a convenient sword () or piece of furniture the audience I saw the movie with started snickering then hooting. Is this ""Austin Powers"" gone medieval? Are we supposed to be laughing at the movie or with it?""Beowulf"" intriguingly splits the difference - it works as a ripsnorting yarn and as sardonic commentary on same - and if you cant handle dueling agendas too bad for you. In its second hour the movie brings on Jolie as a seductive water-nymphomaniac - Grendels mom has got it going on - and the tale takes a darker turn. In its kitschy pulp-epic way ""Beowulf"" asks us to think about what happens to heroes the day after and about what monstrous bargains are necessary to take and keep power. It suggests the beasts we battle are of our own making.Actually it comes right out and says it - subtlety isnt the movies strong suit. But theres pleasure to be had in such popcorn philosophizing and theres sheer wonderment in the aging Beowulfs climactic battle with a dragon a rocketing action set-piece that soars over cliff and sea at the speed of massive leathery wings.""Beowulf"" ends on a quiet note of stalemate though as if to give the action crowd something to think about as they file out. The movies a genuine curiosity an empty-headed techno-blockbuster of ideas. Like all sagas of valor and bloodletting it asks the question put forth in ""Gladiator"" ""Are you not entertained?"" Then it has the nerve to ask ""Why?""Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.(Correction Because of a reporting error the surname of author Seamus Heaney was misspelled in the movie review of ""Beowulf"" in Fridays Weekend section.)

Ray Winstone as Beowulf. Dana Stevens Dana Stevens is Slates movie critic. Far had he fallen with Polar Express An animated washout whose technique Obscured its content thanks to CGI. The Z-mans new technique performance capture Looked creepy in those days. The critics snarled. But brave Zemeckis takes them on againWith Beowulf a 3-D spectacleLike none before. The Anglo-Saxon poemDreaded by school kids since the world was youngHis manly grip reshapes to graphic novel. It all begins in Hrothgars hallowed halls.By Anthony Hopkins played this Danish kingPartakes of mead and merriment one nightAlongside fair Wealthow his noble queen(Robin Wright Penn snatched from the bed of Sean).

Despite the second hours bogging downIn royal squabbling and dull self-reproachThis final battle thrills and charms at once.The airborne chase is monumental funThe heros prowess whopping. None alive Could call Zemeckis subtle; but his styleWell suits the poems crude and earthy brawn.Comic-Con geeks and cinephiles alikeWill gape at the resplendent imagery(But don ye specs and see it in 3-D).

Stephanie Zacharek Share WhatsApp Post 0 All Share Services Topics Movies Entertainment News When I was a little girl I was terrified and mesmerized by a movie I saw once on Saturday afternoon TV called ""Attack of the Puppet People."" I now know it was made by B-movie horror guy Bert I. Gordon in 1958 but at the time all that mattered to me was the creepiness of the concept which involved some mad loner with a penchant for trapping human beings and shrinking them down so theyd fit under little glass domes. Thats what I think of whenever I hear the words ""performance capture"" which is what Robert Zemeckis calls the technique he developed for his 2004 creature feature -- I mean delightful childrens tale -- ""The Polar Express."" ""Performance capture"" means that digital sensors are attached to actors bodies (which are first sheathed in Lycra suits) so their movements can be recorded and input into computers. The data is then used to make an allegedly realistic expressive 3-D image -- Zemeckis very own puppet person Far more malleable than an actual actor and more human too -- just look at the texture of that skin so realistically latexlike ""Beowulf"" is Zemeckis latest foray into soul sucking -- I mean performance capture -- and if youre thinking that the so-called filmmaker has hunkered down to make a nice faithful adaptation of the 2000 Seamus Heaney translation of that weird melancholy epic poem (you optimistic thing you) you should know that this ""Beowulf"" has been adapted reimagined and souped up by writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary. After the hero of the title ""played"" by Ray Winstone severs the arm of Grendel (Crispin Glover) the scary anguished creature that has been terrorizing a community of mead-swilling Danes a comely cutie wonders aloud if all of Beowulfs strength is in his arms -- or if hes got it in his legs as well especially the ""third"" one. You see the ""real"" Beowulf is not a particularly sexy story and Zemeckis knows it. ""Frankly nothing about the original poem appealed to me"" hes quoted as saying in the movies press notes recalling that hed been made to read the damn thing in junior high school. ""But when I read the screenplay that Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary did I was immediately captivated."" He asked Gaiman and Avary why their script was so exciting when the poem was so boring. They explained that the poem was written somewhere between the seventh and the 12th centuries although its story had been passed along verbally for hundreds of years. Since the only people who knew how to write in those days were monks Avary and Gaiman figured these reputable men of the cloth would have edited out all the juicy bits so they added some back in. If you see ""Beowulf"" youll have plenty of opportunities to stare down computer-generated cleavage and one rowdy bearded tattooed warrior crows to one of his conquests about how much noise he makes when he comes. Personally I file that under ""TMI"" especially coming from a cartoon character but you have to admit it would knock any monk off his sandals. You Might Also Like There are certainly ways in which Zemeckis ""Beowulf"" is faithful to the original story Like the poem its based on the movie is partly about the dangers of having power. Actually theres nothing all that wrong with what Avary and Gaiman have done with the story; they simply wanted to make a movie that would be engaging to audiences and theres no law that says a screenwriter has to follow his source material letter for letter. The big problem is that ""Beowulf"" like ""The Polar Express"" before it is just so damned creepy to look at. The characters in their chain mail and woollies and rough homespun gowns move more smoothly than any mere human being ever could; their skin has a weird clammy look and they peer out of glassy humanoid eyes. Theres something very ""Children of the Corn"" about them -- with the exception of pitiable Grendel the spiritual cousin of J.R.R. Tolkiens Gollum who with his pink-gray skin gleaming through coppery scales and his huge blubbery lips is more believable than anything else in the movie. But hes killed off pretty quick. The movies violence is largely of the cartoon sort (sea monsters being stabbed in their one good eye that sort of thing) and much of it is just an excuse for IMAX folderol (there are lots of phallic 3-D effects like big pointy swords coming right at ya). But if your child had to sleep with the light on for a week after seeing ""Ratatouille"" you should know that Beowulf does get a little rough in places. (The picture is rated PG-13.) What about the other actors who have been performance-captured here people like Anthony Hopkins (who plays Hrothgar the king) Robin Wright-Penn (his loyal wife Wealthow) and Brendan Gleeson (Beowulfs right-hand man Wiglaf)? And what about Angelina Jolie whose naked digital form has been dipped in gold for her portrayal of Grendels sexy (but deadly) mommy? They all give performances that would be perfectly OK if only their voices werent locked into these rubbery phony shells. ""Beowulf"" is ambitious overbearing and hollow; it goes overboard to impress yet it never feels truly inventive or imaginative. At best it achieves a level of clumsy camp. It has become hard to remember the days when Robert Zemeckis -- formerly a wonderful filmmaker -- made real movies things like ""Cast Away"" ""Death Becomes Her"" and ""Back to the Future"" though they werent all that long ago. Even the sentimental crowd-pleaser ""Forrest Gump"" no matter how you feel about it is an extremely skillful piece of filmmaking. I dont recall much about the actual plot of ""Attack of the Puppet People"" except being disappointed -- if a little relieved -- that the miniaturized captives never really attacked anyone. But maybe someday Zemeckis puppets will stage their own revolt and save him from himself. Freed from their figurative glass domes they could at least be actors again.

"Beowulf Epic battle in 3-D - Mercury News Entertainment Hot Topics Bay Area festivals Adele Double Exposure Pokemon Go tips Hollywood Vampires Lesher Jazz series Billy Hart Odysseo Hurt Village Print Email Font ResizeBeowulf Epic battle in 3-DImax version may represent the future of the moviegoing experienceBy Bruce NewmanMercury NewsPosted 11/15/2007 032259 PM PSTUpdated 11/16/2007 072837 PM PSTIn many ways ""Beowulf"" is just another overwrought action picture with a bare-chested guy running around shouting ""I am Beowulf"" Well who said you werent? But in ways that have little to do with that guy or this movie - a sort of horny half-naked retelling of the Old English epic poem ""Beo Watch"" - the Imax 3-D version of the picture also may represent the future of the moviegoing experience. Director Robert Zemeckis (who directed the 2004 forerunner in this style of motion-capture animation ""The Polar Express"") cleverly misses no opportunity to put the point of a spear in our face the drool of a monster over our head or a galloping horse in our lap. The dragons and the rats look frighteningly real and feel creepily close in 3-D and more terrifying still on a gigantic Imax screen. (""Beowulf"" is being released in standard 2-D and a non-Imax 3-D version neither of which Ive seen and neither of which I would recommend as long as there is an opportunity for the sensory overload of Imax 3-D.) There are several talky stretches during the film that resemble a very large video game devised by J.R.R. Tolkien. But the initial attack on King Hrothgars mead hall by the monster Grendel (Crispin Glover) introduces an adversary so hideous and formidable that all the king (Anthony Hopkins) can say when the creature has returned to its lair is ""What we need is a hero."" No fooling.Advertisement Grendel has ravaged Hrothgars men but paid scant attention to the cowardly king which seems a little odd. Hrothgar offers half his gold to the man who can slay Grendel and before you know it theres a boatload of Geats (tribesmen from what later became Sweden) heaving-to on the Danish shore. ""I am Beowulf"" says you-know-who trying out his catch phrase for the first time on the locals ""and I am here to kill your monster."" Despite considerable improvement in the photo-realistic rendering of the human characters since ""Polar Express"" people in the movie still resemble inflatable dolls. But the computerized enhancement process is not without its advantages. In the case of ""Beowulf"" it is the ability to transform a doughy 50-year-old character actor like Ray Winstone into a strapping 6-foot-6 action figure who can strut around naked through much of the picture. Not frontally naked but definitely backally. The movie comes with a very sneaky PG-13 rating that would undoubtedly have been an R if the characters werent animated. The body parts look real enough but the computer processing allows them to qualify as fake. This has its ups and downs. On the one hand you see a great deal more of Hopkins backside - and in 3-D - than you might wish to. On the other hand Angelina Jolie As Grendels mother she appears to rise from a completely different gene pool than her hideous boy and keeps on rising out of one pool of water after another dressed in nothing but a sheath of golden water. (There are going to be a lot of 13-year-old boys hitting puberty in medieval Denmark this year.) Jolie looks like an extremely well-proportioned Oscar statue which may be as close as this movie gets to one. Not all of Beowulfs adversaries are monsters. He gets verbally picked apart by the Danish kings diabolical right-hand man Unferth (John Malkovich proving he can be weird even in 3-D). And the kings much younger wife Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn) appears to have her doubts about the Geatsman until he drops trou right in front of her sprawls on the floor of the mead hall and vows to fight Grendel ""as equals."" That titanic battle between naked man and monster is the first of several action sequences that bring ""Beowulf"" - man and movie - back to life. He is Beowulf. Welcome back big guy.

"Beowulf | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Vicki Lewis Vicki Lewis Birdman Leo Brower Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; beowulf ) Beowulf (United States 2007) A movie review by James Berardinelli The legend of Beowulf a mythical hero whose exploits were recounted in an 8th century epic poem has gained unprecedented popularity some 1250 years after it was first told. With the success of The Lord of the Rings which (along with the Harry Potter phenomenon) opened Hollywoods eyes to the potentially huge audience for big bold fantasy movies the inevitability of productions like this became established. Still its surprising that Beowulf has attracted so much attention with three films released in recent years and another one on the way. Of all the cinematic variations on the theme however none is more ambitious and over-the-top than this one the brainchild of director Robert Zemeckis and his screenwriters Roger Avary and Neil Gaiman. Beowulf is designed first and foremost as a visual spectacle of the first degree. Judged in those terms it is a resounding success. Whether viewed in 3-D (the preferred way to experience it) or in a conventional theater this is the sort of movie where the viewer can sit back and become immersed in the splendor of a wild savage colorful world. The movie opens up vistas previously undreamed of providing viewers with a land that rivals the imagination-fueled panoramas of Middle Earth Hogwarts and 300s ancient Sparta. As eye candy goes its tough to find something more satisfying in theaters these days. Beowulf is animated but it employs whats commonly referred to as ""photorealistic animation"" which means that the characters in the movie look almost human. Their features resemble (to one degree or another) the actors who provide the voices. Zemeckis has used this technique before in The Polar Express but it still needs polishing. Theres something a little eerie bordering on unsettling about seeing familiar faces rendered this way. Theres no doubt that it gives the filmmakers unparalleled creative freedom - they can age characters without requiring makeup allow modest performers to do ""nude scenes"" without taking off a stitch of clothing and reduce the complexities of special effects that require the mixing of live-action and CGI. However the human beings have a somewhat ""waxy"" look and their eyes supposedly the windows to the soul are more often dead than alive. An almost indefinable emotional element is thereby lost. The story lacks neither scope nor complexity relying on the ancient poem for its basic structure and embellishing shamelessly. Holes are plugged and new avenues explored. Attempts are made at character development but they arent entirely successful. While its true that the Beowulf on screen during the final reel is not the same man we see at the beginning this is not an individual we become emotionally attached to. Maybe its because the visuals of Beowulf so resemble those of a top-flight computer game but the film often feels more like something thats trying to bring an almost interactive experience to the big screen. Character identification - a key element of any complete motion picture experience - is limited in Beowulf. The film opens in 6th century Denmark in the mead hall of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins). As the warriors feast and get drunk and the king and his young queen (Robin Wright Penn) look on appreciatively the revelry becomes more exuberant. Thats when tragedy strikes. The ugly troll-like monster Grendel (Crispin Glover) breaks into the hall and begins a slaughter. When he is done many of Hrothgars men are dead and the king sends out a summons for heroes to face Grendel. He offers half his treasury as a reward. Beowulf (Ray Winstone) a great warrior from Greatland (part of Sweden) arrives to battle Grendel. Driven more by a lust for glory than a lust for gold Beowulf boasts of what he will do to the monster. He doesnt have to wait long for the encounter. During his first night enjoying Hrothgars hospitality Beowulfs slumber is interrupted by Grendels arrival. Beowulf purists and Im sure there are such people may be chagrined at the idea of a computer animated version of the tale penned by a noted fantasy/graphic novelist (Gaiman) and the co-creator of Pulp Fiction (Avary). However while the movie diverts from the original text it provides an explanation for the licenses it takes. The movie purports to be about the ""true story"" of the legend who inspired the poem. In fact a portion of the epic tale is recited at one point during the movie with a brooding Beowulf reflecting how it offers a departure from what really happened. As in the story Beowulf battles three monsters Grendel the trolls mother (Angelina Jolie) and a dragon. The outcomes of those struggles do not necessarily mirror what one might expect based on the legend. The films content straddles the ratings boundary between PG-13 and R; had it been live action it probably would have garnered the latter but the animated nature of the nudity and gore have allowed the producers to procure the more teen-friendly classification. Beowulf restricts the violence so there are limits to the blood and viscera shown being spilt. The nudity is coy. Grendels mother is shown full frontal but she has no visible nipples. Beowulf is naked when battling Grendel; unlike Viggo Mortensens similar activity in Eastern Promises he manages to keep his privates hidden from the cameras with a precision that Austen Powers would envy. This way the movie gets away with fooling viewers into thinking they have seen more than is actually on screen. Beowulf delivers everything one could reasonably expect from it. Its the kind of film that will appeal immensely to the 300 audience although its not as visceral or as grandiose as the earlier production. Spectacle and high-wattage action interweave in the movies two most impressive fight scenes Beowulfs battle with Grendel and the soaring dipping weaving sequence with the dragon near the end. Zemeckis makes sure the camera takes in everything with a flourish. There are plenty of showy tracking shots and one could argue that the concept of a static camera is unknown to the filmmakers. We dont watch the action from a safe distance; we are put into it. The actors are all well-chosen. Ray Winstone is bombastic enough and via the magic of animation he is de-aged and given a physique that Arnold Schwarzenegger would envy. Anthony Hopkins adds a little prestige to the production; its always nice to have an Oscar winner in the cast. Angelina Jolie gets to shed a few years and grow a tail. Rumor has it that while she didnt film her scenes in the nude the animators referred back to some of her earlier efforts in the name of verisimilitude. Robin Wright Penn Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich are on hand in supporting roles. While Beowulf stands up reasonably well in a traditional theater this is a motion picture that deserves to be seen in a 3D digital environment (if you can stand wearing those annoying glasses for two hours). The film was obviously designed with 3D in mind and is opening in more than 700 such venues. The movie is also being released in IMAX 3D but I have to wonder if that experience might be overwhelming. At any case regardless of the medium this is an effectively brutal story of swords sorcery demons and heroes with an Oedipal hint or two thrown in for flavor.

""What is this The Lord of the Rings?"" Actually not far off. This CGI epic is an adaptation of the same Old English megapoem that inspired Tolkien. But based on how Beowulf was received in 12th-grade English classes - with a shield wall of Cliffs Notes - theres no way the crowd was packed with scholars of archaic literature. The hotness of Angelina Jolie as a slithery water demon certainly didnt hurt. And of course theres the geek attraction of writer Neil Gaiman whose comic-book rendering is the basis for the script. Then again you didnt see this kind of crowd at Stardust. No the real star is the one handed out at the door in plain plastic wrap the 3-D glasses. In the past that would have been fair warning of a cinematic cheesefest. But to the shock of cynics in the audience waiting for this film fantasy to be lame Beowulf turns out to be exciting fun and occasionally breathtaking. No question its a popcorn flick but its cheesy only when it chooses to be. Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movies motion-capture animation is similar to the style he used for The Polar Express. Thats not necessarily a selling point. The visuals are so close to live action one might wonder why he bothered to animate it. The answer is not in Ray Winstones digitally buffed abs but in the monsters he must battle. At first the story sticks close to the 1300-year-old original. The famed mead hall of the Danish king Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) has been turned into a house of horrors by the demon Grendel. Beowulf (Winstone) a hero from foreign lands hears the call of glory and comes to save them. But after tearing the hideous monsters arm from its socket the mighty warrior must face the wrath of Grendels mommy (the decidedly unhideous Jolie). Another reason for the animation Theres no way a live version would have gotten a PG-13 rating. Grendels first rampage through the darkened hall is a masterpiece of horror starting with the monster itself. This is what you get when you start with ugly and soak it in acid for a few hours. The rest of the action lives up to this beginning from Beowulfs Spider-Man moves in battling the demon to his climactic aerial ballet decades later with a dragon thats anything but Eragon cute. But the creative team of Gaiman and Zemeckis does more than deliver action. There also are some humorous touches including a running riff on the old hide-the-heros-peepee gag. The story has been creatively massaged to give it a single dramatic arc which fits modern sensibilities far better than the episodic nature of the original. And perhaps most impressively Grendel emerges as an actual character - horrid and vicious yes but also sad and strangely sympathetic. Theres enough going on here to make this movie entertaining even for those who dont bother to check whether their local theater is equipped for 3-D. But its worth driving a few extra miles to get the full experience. Beowulf is a full-on spectacle and Zemeckis goes out of his way to exploit the third dimension hurling everything he can think of at the audience - swords spears bodies blood even Anthony Hopkins computer-enhanced buttocks. Its all such fun that you may wonder why Hollywood has been so slow to jump on the new digital 3-D technology. After all film space has already been rotated 90 degrees - instead of watching action play out left to right were used to having the gunplay and car crashes pointed our way. Three-D is the logical next step. And if Beowulf is the hit that it looks to be were probably going to see a lot more of it. Reach the reporter at kerry. lengelarizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4896.

Imax or not Imax? - these are the questions) of the crusty Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf offers buxom serving wenches swarthy warriors and the unwittingly hilarious sight of its hero - the great Geat soldier Beowulf - in a naked wrestling match with the slimy wailing 20-foot monster Grendel. In order to keep its PG-13 rating intact - and not to offend the delicate sensibilities of teenage gamer Geats I mean geeks - the film provides a big sword or a beam or a helmet or a passing tray of mead to obscure our vaulting somersaulting unclad heros private parts. Imagine if David Cronenberg had done that with Viggo Mortensen in the rightly famous bathhouse fight scene of Eastern Promises. Or if the director had asked Viggo to wear a towel. Mortensen comes to mind not just because he had the actorly chops to let it all hang out in Eastern Promises but because of course he was Aragorn son of Arathorn in The Lord of the Rings. Said saga would not exist if its author J.R.R. Tolkien hadnt spent years at Oxford poring over manuscripts of the eighth-century tale with its dragons and demons its bedeviled monarchs and tempted heroes that had come to be known as Beowulf. But we digress. Lets talk about Angelina Jolie sheathed only in spray-on gold with a wicked serpents tail and stiletto heels built into her feet. Yes she is Grendels Mother - hot mama - the malevolent matriarch who dwells in the cave with her oozy unhappy monster-boy. That is until this Geat from across the seas takes it upon himself to tear the kid limb from limb. And Grendels Mother feels compelled to leave her lair to exact vengeance and get Beowulf in a lusty sweat to boot. Zemeckis who blazed trails mixing live-action with animation in Who Framed Roger Rabbit blazes not even a footpath here. (Unless you consider making a movie that matches dead-on the images in the accompanying video game some kind of trail-blazing.) Deploying the same motion-capture processes he used in The Polar Express Zemeckis brought the likes of Jolie - and Ray Winstone (as Beowulf) Anthony Hopkins (the Danish king) Robin Wright Penn (the queen) John Malkovich (Unferth the kings sniveling counsel) and various other esteemed thespians - into a studio. He filmed them recorded their voices and then sent them on their fat-paycheck way. Next step dispatching crews of computer animators to paint on the costumes props caverns castlescapes and stormy skies. And more importantly to render the likenesses of the human cast into digital doppelgangers - blank-eyed pixel-faced creepy. And creepily distracting. Not that theres much of anything beyond the combat scenes the swooping aerials the comin-at-ya projectiles (if youve got those 3-D glasses) to keep you occupied. There is some masterful prose - ""I am Beowulf and Im here to kill your monster"" is representative of the most subtlely turned dialogue. And there is Grendels Mother shaking her booty stiletto appendages and all. Beowulf  (out of four stars) Directed by Robert Zemeckis.

And an adaptation of Gabriel Garcia Marquezs novel Love in the Time of Cholera chronicles an epic love affair - from afar. November 23 2007 Save for later Saved New in theaters Im Not There (R)Director Todd Haynes. With Christian Bale Cate Blanchett. (135 min.)""Im Not There"" offers up a daring conceit and then falls apart trying to fulfill it. The film uses different actors to impersonate Bob Dylan throughout the various stages of his motley career. As a young boy Dylan is black (Marcus Carl Franklin). Later he is a womanizing troubadour (Heath Ledger) folk idol (Christian Bale) evangelist (Ben Whishaw) and Western outlaw (Richard Gere). None of these incarnations is remotely revelatory. But as Dylan the rock star Cate Blanchett is nuanced and soulful - shes flabbergasting. Grade C- - Peter Rainer Recommended Could you pass a US citizenship test? Love in the Time of Cholera (R) Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? Photos of the Day Photos of the day 02/08 Director Mike Newell. With Javier Bardem Benjamin Bratt. (138 min.)The famous Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel is about a poet and telegraph clerk Florentino Ariza (Javier Bardem) who falls in love as a young man with the beautiful Fermina Daza (Giovanna Mezzogiorno). Because her social-climbing father (John Leguizamo) forbade the love affair Fermina instead takes up with an aristocratic physician (Benjamin Bratt). Florentino spends the next 50 years trying to rekindle the flame often from afar. The film is attenuated and woozy - not so much Garcia Marquez as a high-class telenovela. Grade B- - P.R.

"Surface Treatment washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On Movies Surface Treatment Network News X Profile View More Activity Play Video TRAILER | Beowulf TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Stephen Hunter Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 16 2007 In ""Beowulf"" director Robert Zemeckis uses a technique called ""motion capture"" to conjure fantastical things angles into action and sweeping vistas to stun your eyes and take your breath away. But what he hasnt mastered and what the technique cant do is this emotion capture. The nuance of the dilated nostril the licked lip the involuntary swallow the unwilled tear -- all gone. Is that a loss? Hard to say. What you are seeing is the process by which actors movements are recorded electronically transformed into imagery then inserted into a meticulously realized computer-generated Dark Ages (its A.D. 506 on the screen). Zemeckis of course has used this technology before in ""The Polar Express."" This is the increasing reality of movies this is the wulf thats at the door. Old dinosaurs like me can rant about pointy-headed issues like the diminishment of performance the absence of chemistry in the cast (can electrons have chemistry? wouldnt they have valence?) but this is the future and it smirks. However for a few seconds lets pretend ""Beowulf"" is a regular movie and such concepts as ""performance"" havent gone missing and deconstruct it based on regular movie considerations. You have to say that the screenwriters Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary have fixed the oldest chestnut the Anglo-Saxon epic tale the bane of freshman year. When the original was assembled (written? collected? sung? chanted?) around the embers back in the good ol 700s or so no theory of psychology existed so there was no storytellers need to conjure coherent behavior patterns or fully realized plots. Man was so powerless and all nature seemed arbitrary so stories could be arbitrary none more so than the epic poem of the Anglo-Saxon peoples (even if it told of Scandinavian adventures) The great warrior Beowulf fights and kills first Grendel then Grendels ma; 50 years later he fights a dragon. Unacceptably episodic today. No arc. No growth. Wheres the reveal? Whats the back story? Thus Gaiman and Avary root the thing in family dysfunction and the two monsters plus the fire breather are the manifestations of alpha-male pathologies for which many innocent people pay in blood even if the alpha male is the only one on the planet capable of dealing with the terror he himself has unleashed. As Zemeckis has it Grendel kicks his way into the mead hall one night all ticked off because the noise is frying his eardrums and eats a lot of human thingies which is easy to do if youre 17 feet tall. Old King Hrothgar (face and voice courtesy of Anthony Hopkins) offers half his treasury to any man who can kill Grendel and soon enough the Viking guy with the body of Apollo shows. For reasons that make no sense except as a marketing decision he decides to fight in the nude and so it is that Ray Winstones Beowulf has a six-pack that Ray Winstone as a human being would have to have spent the better part of the year creating in a gym. I suppose thats a good thing. The fight is a corker an ill-met-by-firelight match that involves much kung-fuing and dragon punching (Eastern martial arts are the model for most of the physical action) until most of Grendel hulks off leaking plasma to die in the marsh and upset Ma. Ma is Angelina Jolie as interpreted by someone who apprenticed by doing airbrush portraits on custom Harley gas tanks. Shes all sleek gleaming catgirl and Jolies great beauty is deployed for its intimidation value as much as for its allure. And thus we learn the curse of Danish kings a curse that would last another few hundred years when a fellow named Hamlet fell for it. They like the beauties too much even if they be demons or moms no matter the consequences. The years pass 50 of them. Under Beowulf the new king the land prospers. And then one day who should arrive but Rodan from Japan breathing fire. No monster lovers its not the old Toho Pterodactyl on wires; its a flying dragon with microwave breath and once more the old warrior has to buckle on the gear and get with it. Again a hell of a fight. Beowulf spearing the flying fright train manages to bind himself to it; hes Ahab aboard the whale looking for a vulnerability as the careening thing napalms the castle raining destruction. Somehow Beowulf gets close enough to go for the heart but his arm isnt quite long enough. Hmmm hes struggling to kill the flying dragon hes riding as it strafes a castle. Whats a fella to do? Now is action this outlandish a movie or a cartoon or some weirdness in between? The answer is the last. Watching it -- through glasses by the way because its in 3-D at most theaters and the shades are cool Wayfarer-type frames not the 50s cardboard punch-outs -- has the strange feel of a dream from someone elses head where the details arent quite sharp enough to convince but so sharp they almost convince. It seems motion-capture technology cant get beneath the skin so while the characters gross movements are convincing enough the microcircuitry of facial expression the complex dance between the fibers of muscle under the skin the twitches the ironic sniggers accompanied by a half-squinted eye the whole nonverbal subtext of human communication is oddly missing. What the technique permits of course is liberation of the camera (or viewing apparatus as a camera really isnt used). Extraordinary things are possible. For example the ""camera"" will begin on a human face climb to the rafters to a scurrying rat stay with him as he dodges and climbs until at last hes pronged by a falcon swept out of the mead hall transported across the snowy fields and deposited in the lair of Grendel where that old crank is getting more and more annoyed at the raucous noise of the celebrants. Or it can stay with Beowulf when he rides his knife down to sunder the thorax of a sea monster splitting the creature and spuming oceans of blood on the descent. You simply couldnt do any of these things in real scale or even miniature. So the astonishing becomes commonplace. Some of the illusions dont pay off. While the dragon is a true demon from hell and the motion-captured Jolie a wonder of the fleshly world poor Grendel fails really to impress. This is the ur-monster of English literature and the designers should have risen to the task. Instead we get a tall old grump with a displaced jaw an attitude problem dirty feet and a runny nose. He looks like Mr. Green Jeans on steroids or those seedy old men who hang out at train stations. At the films end you wonder Is it anything? Or is it just another stupid human trick? I say the story works but I wish theyd teach these avatars to act. Beowulf (114 minutes at area theaters) is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence disturbing images nudity and some sexual material.

As viewers of the much-downloaded ""red band"" trailer know by heart Angelinas computer-generated avatar rises from a pool of water wearing nothing but some gold paint a tail and high-heeled cloven hoofs. In her one major scene about five minutes an hour in she vamps it up in what sounds like a modified version of her Bela Lugosi accent from ""Alexander."" She is heard but not seen in an earlier sequence with her wounded son has a 10-second appearance later on - and her character returns briefly for a wordless climax. Jolies appearance as Grendels nameless but hubba-hubba mom - described as ""that swamp-thing from hell/the tarn-hag"" in Seamus Heaneys best-selling 2000 translation of the anonymous 10th-century poem - may be brief and more than a little campy. But besides boosting what promises to be a very healthy opening weekend at box office she provides crucial motivation for the title character. In this lusty Hollywood version Beowulf rises to the throne of Denmark after striking a Faustian bargain with Grendels mom only to pay an awful price when he has to face a dragon 50 years later. Screenwriters Neil Gaiman (""Stardust"") and Roger Avary (""Pulp Fiction"") have made this musty classic so accessible - and filled in its narrative gaps so inventively - that you wish Zemeckis had filmed it as an R-rated live-action movie that could have been potentially great. Instead Zemeckis has employed motion capture - the same technique he used to lesser effect on ""The Polar Express"" - in which the actors who provide the voice also don suits with electronic sensors that ""capture"" their performances which are combined with computer-generated background and props. ""Beowulf"" can be a lot of fun to watch - at least in the 3-D IMAX version I saw - but its hard to forget for long that youre stranded in a waxworks netherworld between live action and animation. The title character is played by Ray Winstone a short stocky middle-age British character actor. While Winstone provides some excellent line readings and body language (particularly in the later sequences) his towering character looks more like svelter younger ""300"" star Gerard Butler who as it happens starred as Beowulf in a low-budget live-action version of the same story filmed a few years ago in Iceland. Perhaps because of this disconnect Winstones Beowulf is sometimes upstaged by his co-stars. Some of their characters - notably Anthony Hopkins aged King Hrothgar and John Malkovichs conniving Unferth - are modeled rather closely on the actors while Robin Wright Penns long-suffering Queen Wealthow and Brendan Gleesons Beowulf sidekick Wiglaf are not. The biggest scene-stealer here is the eccentric character actor Crispin Glover who in a coup has been cast as the monstrously misshapen yet strangely sympathetic Grendel who looks like a cross between Popeye and a slaughtered side of beef. The films high point is probably Grendels lengthy one-on-one battle with a full-frontal Beowulf which has been amusingly choreographed so a variety of objects strategically hide his private parts. The character animation in ""Beowulf"" isnt in the same universe as Pixars best work. Eyes are creepily devoid of life compared to ""Ratatouille"" and humans skin textures are often closer to high-end video games than first-class animation. And even with motion capture some of the movement is almost as herky-jerky as Ray Harryhausens stop-motion fantasies of the 1960s. And yet although there is a tendency toward blurring when the camera or objects move too quickly ""Beowulf"" contains some of the most spectacular 3-D effects Ive ever seen. I wonder if the 2-D version most people will be seeing is anything near as effective. More at blogs.nypost.com/movies BEOWULFThe Lord of the Pixels.Running time 115 minutes.

Alfred Hitchcock enhanced the technology using it to greater human effect in Dial M for Murder but after the early 60s the 3-D craze more or less faded away until the age of IMAX when we all put on sci-fi headset goggles to gawk at larger-than-life images of dinosaurs sharks and Siegfried amp; Roy. So you know that youve entered a new era when you go to one of the 650 theaters where Beowulf Robert Zemeckis soulfully spectacular medieval monster movie is playing in 3-D (its showing in good old two dimensions at other theaters) and youre handed a pair of glasses that look like something out of a Tom Cruise nostalgia convention. The lightweight specs never have to be adjusted (for once) and they dont give you a headache. The best news is that the film makes good on the promise of its technology. In Beowulf the images are built to pop and not just because swords spears tentacles blood and monster drool keep bursting out at the audience. Every shot -- of castles and midnight woods of treasure-filled caves -- is built for maximum sculptural luster. Zemeckis also upgrades the ""performance capture"" technique (animation wedded to actors facial movements) he employed two years ago in The Polar Express. There the characters looked like dead-eyed rubber dolls shot full of Botox. Theyre now closer to being expressive humans whether its the dissolute Danish king Hrothgar -- a dead ringer for Anthony Hopkins who plays him -- or Beowulf the warrior legend voiced with blokey gruffness by Ray Winstone his feral stare morphed into that of a squinty-eyed Viking hunk. Beowulf is summoned to kill the marauding creature Grendel who is one grotesquely amazing beast -- a big misshapen humanoid glob who looks like hes been roasted on a spit and half-eaten. (Hes like Gollum painted by Francis Bacon.) His face-off with a naked Beowulf has the wonder of a Ray Harryhausen creature feature. According to the ancient poem which the script by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary follows very loosely Beowulf must then confront Grendels mother a mystic siren who rises out of her cave in the person of a nude Angelina Jolie (are you sensing a theme here?) dripping water off her body like golden chocolate. (I thought They just added 30 million to the gross.) Its here that Beowulf acquires an honest touch of intrigue as our hero is revealed to be less than noble. Yet I wont overstate the drama. Beowulf is a solemnly gorgeous at times borderline stolid piece of Tolkien-with-a-joystick mythology. It dares to be quiet which is worthy of respect but there would be little to it without the battles like the hypnotic fight with a dive-bombing dragon in which the aging Beowulf uses an ax to attach himself to the creatures hide and in a thrilling sacrifice does everything in his power to squelch its heart. Now thats fun in three dimensions.

Further advancing the much-vaunted performance-capture technology he unleashed with ""The Polar Express"" director Robert Zemeckis delivers a muscular sometimes stirring but ultimately soulless reinterpretation of ""Beowulf."" For all its visual sweep and propulsively violent action this bloodthirsty rendition of the Old English epic cant overcome the disadvantage of being enacted by digital waxworks rather than flesh-and-blood Danes and demons. Clearly targeting the ""300"" crowd with its commercially shrewd combo of revisionist mythology and gory mayhem pic should draw rousing biz worldwide particularly from younger audiences. Extra booty from 3-D coffers should also help as the Paramount release will open Nov. 16 in standard 2-D 3-D and Imax 3-D. The giant-screen format impressively maximizes the films essentially assaultive approach pelting the viewer with arrows blood spittle and other assorted viscera -- graphic enough to warrant an R rating had the pic (rated PG-13) been rendered in live-action. The original poem may have been composed in Anglo-Saxon and steeped in Scandinavian legend but Zemeckis robustly stylized movie speaks in the very American idiom of the Hollywood pop epic. No doubt aware that for many the mere mention of ""Beowulf"" will conjure tedious memories of high school English class fantasy novelist Neil Gaiman and co-scribe Roger Avary (""The Rules of Attraction"" ""Pulp Fiction"") have taken some intriguing liberties with the heroic narrative presenting it as a study in the corrupting influences of lust and power and casting the titular warrior-kings activities in a more treacherous light. The writers have also infused the saga with an aura of heightened sexuality and bawdy humor that feels decidedly at times distractingly modern for a work set in sixth-century Denmark. Result is at least a much livelier piece of storytelling than the charmless ""Polar Express"" in which Zemeckis first attached little white dots to his actors faces and bodies to record their performances. While the similarly digitized figures in ""Beowulf"" (which was submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts amp; Sciences as an animated film) look eerily close to storefront mannequins at a Renaissance Faire the soft-edged photorealistic style -- suspended somewhere between live-action and animation fairy tale and videogame -- feels somewhat more appropriate in this context lending the story a vaguely mythic sheen. ""Beowulf"" opens amid much drunken revelry in the court of elderly King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and his much younger but long-suffering wife Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn). But all merrymaking ceases with the arrival of Grendel (Crispin Glover) a hideous graphically rendered demon who looks like a refugee from the ""Resident Evil"" franchise and who brutally dismembers and devours Hrothgars men but spares the weak-willed monarch himself. Enter the dashingly goateed Beowulf (Ray Winstone) and his fellow Geatsmen who arrive on Danish shores determined to end Grendels reign of terror. Handsome boastful but less than forthcoming about his weaknesses Beowulf blithely strips down for a head-on clash with the equally naked (if much less photogenic) monster in the kings great hall. Protracted fight sequence which ends in Beowulfs victory is as impressive for its ""Austin Powers""-style cover-up strategies as for its acrobatic choreography. But Beowulf soon faces an even deadlier challenge from Grendels vengeful mother whom he sets out to destroy in her cavernous lair. Our hero turns out to be no match for a viper played by Angelina Jolie in full-on seductress mode; this reptilian goddess makes a truly show-stopping entrance her nude gold-smeared body stalking into the frame on stiletto heels accompanied by the insidiously suggestive strains of Alan Silvestris score. In the most significant departure from the text Beowulf makes a deal with the she-devil -- sealed with some blatantly phallic imagery -- that cements his position as Hrothgars heir apparent. Purists and scholars wont be thrilled with this sordid twist (which handily connects the films first half with events that play out decades later) although Beowulf arguably emerges as a more flawed and genuinely tragic hero as a result. While the epic poem preserved the uneasy tension between the eras Christian and pagan influences Gaiman and Avarys script jettisons the spiritual underpinnings of Beowulfs quest entirely; later he even blames ""the Christ-God"" for ending a glorious era of human valor. Indeed there is no place for God in this barbaric (if highly marketable) world of sex and swordplay where lust is an all-consuming force and graphic disembowelment is served up for the audiences delectation. But a deeper moral void is evident in the way Zemeckis prioritizes spectacle over human engagement in his reliance on a medium that allows for enormous range and fluidity in its visual effects yet reduces his characters to 3-D automatons. While the technology has improved since 2004s ""Polar Express"" (particularly in the characters more lifelike eyes) the actors still dont seem entirely there. Sporting some physical enhancements -- and consequently looking more like Sean Bean in ""The Lord of the Rings"" than himself -- the gravel-voiced Winstone manfully conveys the characters hubris (""I am Beowulf"" is his war cry and aspiring catchphrase) and later his weariness and regret. But this Beowulf is more vocally than visually commanding never fully engaging the emotions the way a righteous medieval badass should. Other actors do make vivid impressions in smaller roles John Malkovich is enjoyably unctuous as Beowulfs jealous court rival Unferth; Wright Penn evinces a wounded beauty as a queen betrayed by two husbands; and Brendan Gleeson brings welcome gravitas and humor to Beowulfs faithful sidekick Wiglaf. Compensating somewhat for the mostly torch-lit interiors Zemeckis and cinematographer Robert Presley (who also shot ""Polar Express"") orchestrate visual flourishes -- majestic crane shots of the frozen Nordic landscape fiery-blue strobe effects for Grendels first attack -- that are especially striking in 3-D. Doug Chiangs production design and Gabriella Pescuccis costumes are scaled appropriately to the primitivism of the setting. Again and again this ""Beowulf"" references how its heros deeds will become the stuff of legend forever enshrined in bards songs in plays and by extension in the movies. Too bad Zemeckis striving for the immortality of myth is unwilling to simply let his characters be mortal. BeowulfProductionA Paramount (in U.S.)/Warner Bros.

Its evident from the script - by British-born graphic novelist Neil Gaiman and Tarantinos one-time collaborator Roger Avary - that it wasnt the power and beauty of the language of our great eponymous anonymous eighth-century Old English epic encomium that attracted the filmmakers. Nor indeed was it the works insight into pre-Anglo-Saxon history as Anthony Hopkins Welsh-accented kinsmen and the snowbound mountain castles of table-flat Denmark bear eloquent witness. But even as a mere convenient launchpad for some vertiginous 3D-assisted man-on-beast heroics located in the eternally-adolescent gothic/fantasy/horror comic-book tradition it seems an irrelevance.Part of the problem is the animation technology itself. In re-animating the actors performances enhanced motion capture (the technique Zemeckis adopted with The Polar Express) makes of them creepier spectres than the creatures by which they are often surrounded. Thus however gloopy and cadaverous the 20ft Grendel (voiced by crazy Crispin Glover) appears or how unexpected we find the swoops of the fire-breathing dragon (non-Equity) and how bizarre the serpents-tailed Goldfinger babe presented by his protean mother (Angelina Jolie) none of them can compete with the sheer unsettling oddity of the humans with their milky-blind eyes. This applies especially to our hero Beowulf beneath whose glistening highly sexualised  often naked rejuvenated body and bulging leather-bound musculature lies the just-detectable face and movements of dear old Ray Winstone. The final kinetic aerial battle scenes are eye-poppingly spectacular - especially in the 3D IMAX-version under review - but they come way too late to save the film.

The violence and the sexual references were appalling. I also dont understand the point of animation trying to be so realistic The film may just as well have used the real actors (although maybe not our Ray as Beowulf ) and CGI for Grendel dragons etc. Yes this technology is great for films like Shrek and Monsters Inc. but they dont quite seem to be there yet with people.

Watched the whole thing thinking ""hang on that wasnt in the book"". Im going to dig the book out of the loft and re-read it just so the saga remains as it should be in my mind. As animations go it was a good piece but the eyes are the windows to the soul And the characters eyes were souless rendering the characters with a lifeless aire.

The language story and acting were atrocious with a couple of minor exceptions viz. Jolie and one other whose name escaped me.

Not suitable for children - should be a 15 or higher rating. I would advise responsible parents not to take younger children.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 29 2007JimFeaturedThe 3D saved it... oh and Angelina Jolie covered in gold.

I took my kids to see it (11 and 12) and whilst I agree with some comments (a bit gorey and scary) I thought it no worse than Harry Potter. Valdemorts sinister goings on are much worse. Both my children absolutely loved it my daughter said it was the best film she had ever seen I hope the alarmist comments wont put people off a great film with superb special effects fantasticFlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyNov 22 2007KarenFeaturedLove this film Cant wait till the DVD comes out.
