Photo Credit AP Photo advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT A down-on-his luck reporter discovers what seem like paranormal government secrets. Rating R (language brief violence) BOTTOM LINE Despite a gamely goofy Clooney this would-be wacky comedy feels oddly staid. CAST George Clooney Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges Kevin Spacey WHEN/WHERE Playing at Area theaters LENGTH 136 Pretend that you could pick the actor to play Bill Django a graying ex-hippie afloat on a cloud of Zen in the offbeat comedy ""The Men Who Stare at Goats."" If you answered Jeff Bridges already famous for his laid-back turn as The Dude in ""The Big Lebowski"" you are either a Hollywood casting director or laboring in some other field that rewards thinking deep inside the box. And you just might appreciate ""Goats"" which frequently resorts to the obvious when whats needed is an element of surprise. advertisement | advertise on newsday Based on Jon Ronsons (supposedly) true book ""Goats"" has one joke Many years ago the Army demoralized by Vietnam and the peaceniks finally joined the zeitgeist by forming the groovy First Earth Battalion. Its mission to generate devastatingly good vibes. Now in the war-torn Middle East reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) meets former Earther Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) who spins tales of psychic warfare and the ability to kill a goat using the evil eye. None of it works though Cassady does have a knack for remaining clueless under pressure. Eventually there is a showdown involving Lyns onetime guru Django (Bridges) and a renegade pupil (Kevin Spacey). Dont feel extra-perceptive if youre sensing a lack of plot. Without one director Grant Heslov and writer Peter Straughan try to find humor in hot tubs yoga and a massive batch of LSD. All in all ""Goats"" would have been groaningly familiar even back in the 1960s.

Joe Neumaier Thursday November 5 2009 725 PM Title A reporter discovers a team of psychic soldiers. With George Clooney. Director Grant Heslov (130). R Language drug use. At area theaters.Forget that they made the superserious ""Good Night and Good Luck"" -- George Clooney and Grant Heslov know from satire. So what works best in ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" -- which Heslov directed Clooney stars in and both co-produced -- is the hippy-dippy absurdity of ""psychic soldiers"" trained by the U.S. military.When the haze wears off and the movie grounds itself in reality its a bummer. Until then though whats weird here is gloriously weird.Adapted from a 2005 nonfiction book of the same name the film opens with a wry disclaimer (""More of this is true than you might believe"") before introducing Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) a down-on-his-luck journalist. In Michigan in 2002 Wilton happens upon a former member of a group trained in the 70s and 80s to fight wars and spy with their minds. He considers the guy bull-goose loony until hes in the Middle East at the start of the Iraq War and meets Lyn Cassady (Clooney) in a Dubai bar.Cassady a wild-eyed businessman-mercenary with a shifty-looking moustache belonged to that group. In flashbacks we see the formation of the First Earth Battalion by soldier-turned-spiritual wanderer Bill Django (Jeff Bridges). Djangos goal was to create ""warrior monks"" (or ""Jedi knights"" as they called themselves) whod be able to walk through walls kill goats by concentrating on stopping their hearts and disarm enemies by making ""sparkly eyes."" His idea was approved by the Pentagon and for a decade Djangos men disappeared down a khaki rabbit-hole where California dreamin met military precision.Their funding is eventually cut and theyre disbanded but some of the out-there methods they worked on are adopted during the war on terror. Wilton and Cassady to their shock find this out while theyre deep in the desert where men are men and goats need to watch their backs.Clooney like his pal Brad Pitt is always most fun when he lets loose and hes a hoot and a half. Bridges Django is a blissed-out spiritual brother to Jeff (The Dude) Lebowski and Kevin Spaceys by-the-book psychic turncoat is their ideal foil. Only the trying-too-hard McGregor doesnt fit but thats mainly because Wilton is the most square person on-screen.Peter Straughans rudderless screenplay cant quite distill Jon Ronsons book (names are changed to protect the Jedi) and the narrative flips and flops ruin the comedic flow. Still Clooney and Heslov are turned on by and tuned in to the sun-shiney ludicrousness -- and whacked-out believability -- of it all. The Catch-22 they face is that theres really too much story here to be a movie.jneumaiernydailynews.com Send a Letter to the Editor Join the Conversation facebook Tweet PC Richard and Son Get Daily News stories delivered to your inbox.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Thursday Nov. 05 2009 130PM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 318PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English The Men Who Stare at Goats Directed by Grant Heslov Written by Peter Straughan Starring George Clooney Ewan McGregor and Jeff Bridges Classification 14A Theres a certain whiff about The Men Who Stare at Goats  which is not the aroma of the livestock of the title but the pungent aroma of self-satisfaction. Like the larky series of Oceans movies though on a fraction of the budget Goats is a conspiracy story with a high-profile cast - George Clooney Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges - all trying to outdo each other in wacky deadpan performances as a trio of screwball U.S. psychic agents. Goats is produced by Clooney and directed by Grant Heslov who co-wrote the Edward R. Murrow biopic Good Night and Good Luck  and at least on the face of it its another example of Clooney expressing his liberal conscience through film. The script is based on reality - or at least what passes for reality in U.S. military-intelligence circles. As the film opens the onscreen text makes a baffling declaration ""More of this is true than you would believe."" The source of the story is British journalist Jon Ronsons 2005 non-fiction book of the same title which documented the U.S. Armys research into paranormal and psychological warfare since the Eisenhower era. The movie focuses on Ronsons revelations about a hippie-influenced psychic commando squad formed by the U.S. military at the end of the seventies. Among the techniques they purportedly worked on were disarming enemies with flirtatious ""dazzle eyes"" walking through walls predicting the future and - by practising on goats - mastering the art of death by staring. The Men Who Stare at GoatsOfficial trailer Trying to put this absurdity into a dramatic shape scriptwriter Peter Straughan invents hapless reporter Bill Wilton (a flat Ewan McGregor very much sucking the hind teat here) who stumbles on the story of the secret psychic commandos. Running away from a marriage gone wrong Wilton takes off to Kuwait during Desert Storm. In a hotel bar he meets a grizzled military man who declares himself a former ""Jedi warrior"" (at least McGregor doesnt smirk). The mans name is Lyn Cassady (Clooney). He was previously the star of the New Earth Armys future-predicting goat-killing team. Cassadys story jibes with the ravings of a kook Wilton previously met in the United States so he decides to follow him into Iraq on a secret mission. During an interval when they get kidnapped Cassady fills Wilton in through a series of flashbacks. The movie catches fire briefly with the story of Marine colonel Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) who had a vision while being blown up in Vietnam. He left the army turned hippie and then returned to sell the brass on a new scheme An army of peace-inducing ""warrior monks"" who work with thoughts rather than bullets. (""Well be the first superpower to have superpowers."") Basic training includes Buddhist chanting colonics daily affirmations dancing to Billy Idol and competitive ESP games. The fun stops with the arrival of Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey). An ambitious careerist envious of Djangos star status hes determined to get rid of all this ""hippie crap."" Hooper usurps the leadership and turns the New World Army over to the ""dark side."" A reunion in the Iraq desert finds Hooper now heading up a privatized mercenary force still working on the goats and subjecting PoWs to cruel and unusual treatment including video loops of Barney the Dinosaur. All this feels like a long prelude to a real film that never happens. Director Heslov making his feature directing debut is awkward with the time transitions and reliant on slapstick humour - car crashes roof falls and pokes in the eye. These Stooges-like antics are more about showing what good sports his stars are than honing any real satiric edge. Among the grounds for court martial is a flagrant misuse of farce. Ronsons book documents how some of these awful ideas found their way into George W. Bushs War on Terror including the use of torture music at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. The movie revels in the lunacy while shrugging off the cruelty. If this is what a Hollywood liberal conscience looks like its a glib and useless thing.

Especially the handsome tan-and- black one about to hit the deck in ""The Men Who Stare at Goats.""The man eyeing the goat in this standoff is no ordinary fella. Hes psychically gifted soldier Lyn Cassady played by George Clooney who along with director Grant Heslov produced this uneven if sweet-natured comedy about paranormal activities and the military. The title alone is worth the price of the ticket though one gets the sense from reviews that journalist Jon Ronsons 2005 nonfiction book -- about a clandestine military operation that attempted to turn soldiers into psychic warriors -- is the better if darker-tinted value. To make Ronsons tale of eccentric characters and wacky nefarious military schemes into a fluid narrative writer Peter Straughan provides narrative glue in the person of journalist Bob Wilton. Ewan McGregor portrays the Michigan newspaper reporter. Assigned a story about a local man with telepathically lethal skills (Stephen Root) Wilton learns of a post-Vietnam Army program intended to train soldiers in psychic battle. The brains behind the endeavor was a Vietnam veteran New-Age seeker of truths and author of the New Earth Army manual named Bill Django (Jeff Bridges). His most promising conscript was Cassady. When Wiltons wife strays he does what men do when bruised by women He ""goes to war."" In Kuwait City he meets the legendary Cassady and embarks on a mad journey through Iraq. Bridges has an inviting aura as Django. In flashbacks we learn he had his ""alternative combat"" epiphany in the midst of a firefight. The movie contains quite a few notions about the warriors ambivalence but doesnt wrestle with them enough to make a tart point. Kevin Spacey plays the fictionalized New Earth Armys rotting apple Larry Hooper. In a world in which the fighters refer to themselves as Jedi Warriors (they actually did) he represents the dark side. ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" suffers a problem that clever movies featuring Clooney often do It imagines itself wittier more incisive about the issues it takes on than it actually is. (""The Informant"" shares this vaguely smug attitude though it was more tightly executed.) Comedy they say is in the timing. So one probably shouldnt blame the movie for its awkward arrival. But it seems too much a privilege to be chuckling in the theater about psychic warfare while the unfunny business of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan continues. Some of the films hardest-to-believe stuff is true. The Iraqis did drop leaflets onto American soldiers during the first Gulf War telling them ""Your wives are back at home having sex with Bart Simpson and Burt Reynolds."" There was a weapon called the Predator (not to be confused with the drone of the same name) that looked like an innocent plastic toy. In the desert Cassady gives Wilton a demonstration of its many uses. Its pure Ron Popeil and irresistably silly. ""THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS.""

Inspired by previous mustache movies like Matt Damon in ""The Informant"" and Andy Samberg in ""Hot Rod"" George Clooney (and Kevin Spacey) gamble that you wont be able to stop giggling at their precious little staches in the inept and shapeless would-be comedy ""The Men Who Stare at Goats."" In the early weeks of the Iraq war a journalist (Ewan McGregor) is stranded in Kuwait where in a bar he meets a bonkers trash-can salesman named Cassady (Clooney) who mutters dark improbabilities about his prior service in a goofy New Age Army unit. Despite Cassadys raving the reporter agrees to drive around the Iraq desert with him looking for fun. The plot consists of McGregor playing the straight man as Clooney babbles of the weirdness (shown in flashbacks) that was the New Earth Battalion a fanciful group of soldier-psychics. ""More of this is true than you would believe"" says a caption at the start. You will pardon me if I dont believe that a Dude-like lieutenant colonel (Jeff Bridges) with a footlong ponytail presided over a secret Army unit that successfully trained soldier-hippies to kill goats with staring or to hang sandbags from their scrotums with hooks. ""We must become the first superpower to develop super powers"" Bridges says. You are meant to get the impression that a great gonzo Hunter Thompson freakapalooza is exploding all around you. Yet when Clooney says he and his cohorts were like ""Jedi"" the payoff is McGregor delivering a Disney Channel-style line ""The Force truly was strong with this one."" (McGregor played a Jedi in three awful movies you have probably forgotten by now.) Periodically Spacey and his mustache slither into the flashbacks. Hes a sinister sergeant who wants to take over the operation from the Bridges character. Sample laugh line ""Still hes the best. Oh Twizzlers"" Written by Peter Straughan who wrote the equally blundering film version of ""How To Lose Friends and Alienate People"" this one-joke script wouldnt have made it out of development boot camp if it hadnt attracted the interest of Clooney and Grant Heslov the friend with whom he wrote ""Good Night and Good Luck."" Heslov directs for the first time in a career that I pray will consist of one movie. ""I was on a mission even if I didnt know what kind of mission it was"" McGregor says. Im with you. If you figure it out shoot me an e-mail. The movie hes in has all the sand of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" but half the laughs and none of the conciseness. At the end as I stumbled back onto the street as disoriented and grateful as a released POW I thought Id need a calendar to calculate the length of time Id been away.

Comments click to enlarge The Men Who Stare at Goats 2009 Inspired by Jon Ronsons nonfiction book this genial but ultimately plodding farce looks at the bizarre outer reaches of the U.S. armys psychological operations. A reporter covering the Iraq war (Ewan McGregor) meets a mysterious army veteran (George Clooney) who claims he was once involved in a secret program to create a squad of ""warrior monks"" who could carry out paranormal attacks against Americas enemies. Flashbacks detail the programs genesis under a beatific Zen master (Jeff Bridges doing his Big Lebowski routine) and the present-tense plot eventually reveals how the idea has been revived and twisted under one of his meaner lesser students (Kevin Spacey). Clooney and Bridges model an assortment of wigs and facial hair as they labor to put across their outsize characters; at its best the movie recalls a subpar episode of MASH. Grant Heslov (Good Night and Good Luck) directed a script by Peter Straughan (How to Lose Friends amp; Alienate People). R 95 min. By J.R.

The armed forces tended to be presented as either noble or amoral but seldom as clowns. The Men Who Stare at Goats is refreshing then for its knockabout approach to martial matters; its problems lie with its lackadaisical approach to narrative and structure.The film is a dramatised version of Jon Ronsons non-fiction book about a small pocket of the US Army given licence to experiment with non-violent and paranormal approaches to conflict resolution. American journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) arrives in Kuwait in 2003 with a broken heart and something to prove. Stumbling upon Lyn Cassady (George Clooney) whom he recognises as having been involved in the so-called First Earth Battalion he finds himself on what could well be a wild goose- (or goat-) chase inside post-Saddam Iraq. Meanwhile he fills us in on the battalions history from its instigation by Nam vet-turned-hippy visionary Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) to its undoing by bitter psy-op Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey).Theres plenty to enjoy in the films outre set-pieces insouciant tone and playful performances Clooney keeps us guessing about Cassadys abilities (and sanity) and Bridges gets to deliver lines like Im your commanding officer and Im ordering you to let out the dance Theres also a running joke about Jedi warriors that bounces nicely off McGregors Star Wars pedigree. But the film hedges its claims to veracity (more of this is true than you would believe indeed) and fails to make its characters or narrative dramatically compelling. The result feels less like a transcendental breakthrough than a bit of conjuring misdirection. Fun trick though.

""I would hate to think that that was the last movie I saw before I died"" I wholeheartedly agree son. It wasnt so much that it was a bad film more that it could have been so much better. McGregor should take a leaf out of Connerys book and stick with the Scottish accent whatever the hell nationality he is playing. Its a lovely accent and a thousand times better than the strangulated American accent he produces. Clooney was ok as was Bridges but Spacey had one or those roles that makes you want to punch him.

"Movie mini-review Ann Hornaday on George Clooney in Men Who Stare at Goats washingtonpost.com gt; Arts amp; Living gt; Movies >> Follow Movies On The Men Who Stare at Goats Movie mini-review Ann Hornaday on George Clooney in Men Who Stare at Goats George Clooney is miscast in the wartime satire ""The Men Who Stare at Goats."" (Laura Macgruder) Network News X Profile View More Activity TOOLBOX Resize Print E-mail Reprints By Ann Hornaday Washington Post Staff Writer Friday November 6 2009 Youd have to be out of your mind to object to watching George Clooney -- in full Clark Gable mode no less -- for an hour and a half. But hes part of the problem with ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" a wartime satire that glides along with an easy slightly gonzo grin on its face but never quite goes anywhere. Clooney is admittedly appealing but oddly miscast as Lyn Cassady a former soldier who was recruited to a top-secret psy-ops outfit trying to harness supernatural powers. Ewan McGregor plays a journalist who embeds with Cassady a psychic master now working as a private contractor on an Iraq war mission. As the two make their way on an increasingly digressive journey ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" becomes an amusing but finally trivial picaresque part Hunter S. Thompson part Stanley Kubrick with none of their ferocious genius. Which isnt to say that ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is a bust. Directed by Grant Heslov (who wrote Clooneys ""Good Night and Good Luck"") the movie unfolds with an easygoing ambling geniality and features a very funny and improbably touching performance by Jeff Bridges as Lyns New Age mentor (picture the Dude in fatigues). But maybe because real-life Americans and Iraqis are still in harms way over there the films arch tone doesnt quite play. ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is an enjoyable bagatelle but somehow you want it to be more.  and a half R. Contains profanity some drug content and nudity. 95 minutes.

(SUPPLIED PHOTO)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterFri. Nov. 6 2009Starring George Clooney Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. Directed by Grant Heslov. 93 minutes. At major theatres. 14ABoth the New Age movement and the U.S. military are poked at with equal enthusiasm in The Men Who Stare at Goats a satire set in a world where men are men and the cloven-hoofed livestock has every right to be nervous.Covert work seems to suit George Clooney who strays back into Burn After Reading territory as oh-so-serious Lyn Cassady a fellow who claims to have been a founding member of an elite military squad that employed paranormal powers to wage peace on the planet.Hes a ""warrior monk"" a Jedi in the First Earth Battalion Lyn explains earnestly to a rapt reporter Bob (Ewan McGregor) a Michigan scribe who stumbles on Lyn in a Kuwait City bar.Bob is desperate to get to Iraq figuring filing stories as an embedded reporter will help take his mind off his marriage-battered heart and perhaps win his cheating wife back. That the Jedi-tracker Bob is played by McGregor known to Star Wars fans as Obi-Wan Kenobi is funny - the first time.Article Continued BelowThe movie is based on Jon Ronsons strange-but-true 2004 book of the same name that exposed a secret wing of the U.S. military determined to develop psychic soldiers who could among other things kill a goat just by staring at it.Oprah-quoting Lyn captivates Bob with his tales of his training as a soldier of love and his ability to move clouds find missing people pass through walls and to his guilty shame kill a de-bleated goat all with the power of his mind. He can also conjure up ""sparkly eyes"" to mind meld with soldiers convincing them to drop their weapons.Lyn learned his amazing skills under the tutelage of Bill Django (a delightfully crazed Jeff Bridges in full The Big Lebowski mode) who spent several years researching New Age theories among like-minded naked people in California hot tubs at the Armys behest. Django returned to Ft. Bragg with a ponytail and new worldview and set up the First Earth Battalion.But it wasnt all dancing to Bostons ""More Than a Feeling"" and intense yoga sessions in this mans new army. There was an enemy within. Karma-killing recruit Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) let jealousy cloud his soldiers vision and he set out to pull the magic carpet out from underneath the program putting an end to Djangos career.Prompted by a vision from his former commander (yes they have those too) Lyn sets out to find Django stumbling on a secret psychic-solider training camp in the desert where Hooper is busy taking crazy to new heights. Its here that the movie starts to lose steam and squander some of the goodwill earned with earlier laughs.First-time director Grant Heslov who teamed with Clooney to write Good Night and Good Luck does best when he keeps his strong cast under control which isnt always the case. The picture lacks discipline and focus at times but its fun despite the chaos although a wandering-in-the-desert scene goes on far too long.While Clooney and Bridges are in top form McGregor who also acts as the movies narrator doesnt have much to do besides look scared an/or incredulous. And Spacey is all over the map - Eddie Haskell in some scenes barking mad in others.Hoopers loopiness is the only thing that saves the final act from sliding off the table when the story starts to limp like a three-legged goat.The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    24degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsToronto to test mobile ticketing app for island ferryNew way to buy tickets online aimed at cutting down lineups for island ferry.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Robert Cargill 11/06/2009 Almost 20 years ago director Roger Spottiswoode put to the screen an adaptation of an incredible book chronicling some of the crazy unbelievable things our government through the CIA did during the Vietnam War. It was about a group of wild unruly but brilliant pilots who flew stripped down civilian planes on military missions that NEVER HAPPENED. Drugs money weapons -- all to people we werent supposed to be giving drugs money and weapons to. The idea of the movie was to highlight the humor and adventure of the times rather than showcasing how darkly illegal and immoral it was -- although they never shied away from that. Starring Mel Gibson and Robert Downey Jr. the film shared the title of the book Air America and was something of a wartime road movie comedy. The reason I mention this is because The Men Who Stare at Goats is a nearly identical attempt to bring a very good book about very messed up things to the big screen. This time rather than Gibson and Downey Jr. the film stars Ewan McGregor and George Clooney as the humorous duo and the story of what they are up to is much further beyond the fringe of a secret force. It is about the militarys investigations into psychic super soldiers Jedi warriors as they openly refer to them. Reportedly based upon true accounts the book -- and portions of the movie -- purport to expose the strange investigations into clairvoyance telekinesis and as the title refers to the ability to stop a beings heart just by staring at them. It is a strange occasionally goofy comedy about how far a supposed branch of the military named the ""New Earth Army"" went into trying to activate psychic powers within its soldiers. Drugs yoga dance lessons positive reinforcement -- you know everything youd expect from military training. Headed by a crazed hippie played brilliantly by Jeff Bridges the unit supposedly existed in the early 80s and carried on until its sad embarrassing demise. Clooney plays Lyn Cassady one of the New Earth Armys top performers -- a man who had been lost in life until finally finding his place in the world. But when that place is taken away he listlessly wanders through life until being reactivated -- sort of -- by a vision from his former commander. Hes joined by a reporter (McGregor) who is on his own mission to find himself. The two end up in the Iraqi desert searching for something Lyn wont talk about while we experience flashbacks and explanations about the NEA and its history. The films chief problem for many will be its lack of a distinct plot. Theres not much REALLY going on in the film. Effectively it is playing with the classic road movie framework without a real tangible goal to keep the audience glued. However what is there is very funny really interesting and ultimately satisfying. Its a strange little film that wont connect with everybody but the people who dig it will really get into it. Much like Air America. I was constantly entertained. Everyone in this film is at the top of their game; Clooney is riveting as Cassady and McGregor gives his best wide-eyed wonder as the young reporter getting the biggest story of his life. While not perfect The Men Who Stare at Goats is an unusual funny trip into what may be the secret goings-on of the U.S. military. Definitely a film for those looking for something off the beaten path though the lack of a more defined plot keeps this from being a must-see film.

Laura Macgruder/AP          View Caption About video ads View Caption of Test your knowledge Could you pass a US citizenship test? It probably sounded funny on paper and yes onscreen there are a few moments of deadpan wackiness. But ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" starring George Clooney mostly comes across as a botched cross between ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Three Kings"" (which also starred Clooney to much better effect). Its loosely based on a nonfiction book by British journalist Jon Ronson about the US militarys top-secret plan to create a battalion of psychic soldiers in the wake of Vietnam. Jeff Bridges plays the Big Lebowski-ish ponytailed Bill Django who founds the New Earth Army and counsels his cadre among them Clooneys stone-faced Lyn Cassady on the proper way to run invisibly through walls and kills goats by staring at them. Kevin Spacey as another of the New Earthers lives up to his surname. Ewan McGregor plays the Ronson-like journalist which mostly consists of double takes. By bringing the story into Iraq Grant Heslov courts tastelessness. Gooniness and Gitmo dont mix. Grade C+ (Rated R for language some drug content and brief nudity.)

Media San Francisco Chronicle The Men Who Stare at Goats Comedy-drama. Starring Ewan McGregor George Clooney Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey. Directed by Grant Heslov. (R. 93 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) Theres a lot of energy in ""The Men Who Stare at Goats."" It can be found in the amped-up performances and in the zigzagging narrative which hurtles back and forth through time as though the people who made the movie couldnt wait to tell us such amazing and incredible things. This energy is persuasive. If the filmmakers are so urgent and excited about their story theres the sense that we should be too. Its not until about an hour later that an uneasy thought creeps in like a dark cloud over a picnic. This thought hardens into a conviction by the time ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is almost over Theres not much of a story here. All that energy all that enthusiasm and all that self-generated propulsion are about one thing distracting us from realizing it. This is not to say that ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" lacks a story. It has one but a bland one with no impact and no sense of arrival. Based on Jon Ronsons book about the U.S. Armys New Age experiments in the 1980s the movie takes a few mildly interesting facts and tries to build a zany narrative around them. But the characters and situations feel like mere constructions by the filmmakers whose real investment is in alas those few mildly interesting facts. However the movie has one big element in its favor and thats George Clooney who is as good here as hes ever been. A dozen years ago Clooney was one of the most ill-at-ease actors around. Then he stopped the head wagging and became a charismatic leading man in ""Out of Sight"" (1998). He has continued to grow ever since taking on character parts exploring his silly side all the while building a screen identity thats as specific and engaging as that of any classic film star. Like a James Stewart or a John Wayne Clooney represents something just standing there - integrity shrewdness irony and self-deprecation. Or to put it simply todays American man. Whats impressive about Clooney in ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" is how he marries his goofy comic side with his dramatic side. He plays Lyn who 20 years ago was the most gifted paranormal in the New Earth Army. Recruited by its founder an officer (Jeff Bridges) who discovered drugs and spirituality in Vietnam he becomes part of a group developing extrasensory techniques to locate people and objects predict the future and bring about peace on Earth. Many years later during the Iraq war he is discovered by Bob (Ewan McGregor) a small-time American reporter and a fictional stand-in for Ronson (who is British and not small time at all). As Lyn Clooney talks about his past and walks a very delicate line conveying the characters quirkiness silliness and dreaminess but also his pain dignity and seriousness. Hell interrupt himself two words into a sentence and communicate that sentences complete meaning. Clooneys capacity to convey thought has come a long way in a decade. McGregor stuck in a purely reactive role stands around and endures the movies in-joke references to him in ""Star Wars."" Even Kevin Spacey as Lyns rival at the New Earth Army is given little to do. Bridges fares better getting to portray his characters life journey (from ignorance to enlightenment to doubt) through broad decisive strokes. But when the dust settles theres not much for the actors to get behind. There was never much there to begin with besides the curious fact that in the 80s a special military tried to teach men to kill goats by staring at them. Thats weird. Thats kind of interesting. Thats not enough for a movie. -- Advisory Naughty language drugs brief nudity (so dont blink).

Disney By Joe Morgenstern Updated Nov. 6 2009 1201 a.m. ET To put it bluntly if Scroogely Disneys 3-D animated version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is a calamity. The pace is predominantly glacial--that alone would be enough to cook the goose of this premature holiday turkey--and the tone is joyless despite an extended passage of bizarre laughter several dazzling flights of digital fancy a succession of striking images and Jim Carreys voicing of Scrooge plus half a dozen other roles. ""Why so coldhearted?"" Scrooges nephew Fred asks the old skinflint. The same question could be asked of Robert Zemeckis who adapted and directed the film and of the company that financed it. Why was simple pleasure frozen out of the production? Why does the beloved story feel embalmed by technology? And why are its characters as insubstantial as the snowflakes that seem to be falling on the audience? A catch-all answer--and by now an all-too-familiar one--lies in the unnature of that technology. Like ""The Polar Express"" and ""Beowulf"" which were also directed by Mr. Zemeckis ""A Christmas Carol"" employs a motion-capture process that translates the movements of live actors into fantasy images. For its advocates the process is cost-efficient and good enough. For its detractors including me motion capture has become synonymous with a special sort of semi-lifelessness--body language that is vaguely impoverished faces with limited mobility and dead eyes. In the global marketing push for his new film the director has dismissed such problems as essentially solved. But they havent been solved at all; theyve only been mitigated and partially masked by the novelty value of 3-D. Motion capture remains an impediment to capturing emotion. ""A Christmas Carol"" soars only when Scrooge is in temporal transit--one lyrical sequence flies him back to his boyhood village. And some of the action as well as a cataclysmic climax fueled by hellfires and hellwinds will scare little kids out of their little wits. Dickens framed his novella as a moral tale. Disney sells it as a thrill ride--""The Polar Express"" with a really bad Santa. Well its a free country and a public-domain property. Nevertheless you can almost see the various rooms on the Disneyland ride-to-be while the movie makes its way from Victorian past to fun-house future. (Maybe the rides sound design-to-be is why the Ghost of Christmas Present laughs so long and maniacally.) In the turgid stretches between action sequences the drama or whats left of it makes its way with such ponderous self-important artistry that Scrooges present threatens to become an eternity. This sad excuse for family entertainment tries to enshrine a classic while defacing it. Precious ENLARGE Gabourey Sidibe in Precious Lionsgate One of the most telling moments of a shockingly beautiful film called ""Precious"" comes toward the end and its hardly more than a throwaway--the heroine glances at a mirror and sees herself. Until then mirrors have reflected her desperate fantasies of who she might be--a svelte blonde a bejeweled black dancer or cover girl. Thats because Claireece ""Precious"" Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) has found the sight of her physical self--like the plight of her spiritual self--unendurable. A 16-year-old African-American in the Harlem of 1987 she is mountainously obese sexually and psychically abused illiterate almost mute and pregnant with her second child. The drama begins by giving her spirit voice--its another notion of ""A Beautiful Mind""--and follows her growth from a rageful child with a turbulent inner life to a formidable young woman with a life full of promise and hope. The full contractual title of the film which was directed by Lee Daniels is ""Precious Based on the Novel Push By Sapphire."" (Geoffrey Fletcher did the screen adaptation.) In addition to striking a blow for books and the written word the title serves as a reminder that ""Precious"" is a work of fiction by the African-American poet who calls herself Sapphire and something of a fantasy in its own right--an inspirational fable about the power of kindness and caring. (The producers include Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry.) ENLARGE George Clooney below is one of the stars of The Men Who Stare at Goats. Overture Films Thats not to diminish the fables value only to note the near-saintly devotion of an alternative-school teacher Ms. Rain (Paula Patton) and a social worker Ms. Weiss (Mariah Carey) and to acknowledge the time-lapse pace of the heroines blossoming under their care. ""Precious"" is genuinely and irresistibly inspirational. If the filmmaking werent so skillful and the acting werent so consistently brilliant you might mistake this production for a raw slice of life from a Third World country where movies can still be instruments of moral instruction and social change. If Ms. Sidibe werent playing the title role its hard to imagine what ""Precious"" would be. She doesnt play it she invades and conquers it with concentrated energy and blithe humor. (Referring to the sophisticated Ms. Rain and her lesbian partner Precious says ""They talk like a TV channel I dont watch."") And shes not the only spectacular attraction. The comedienne and actress MoNique is stunningly effective as the heroines monstrous mother Mary who makes a mockery of maternal instincts and comes undone in a ghastly confrontation that goes a long way toward explaining her monstrosity. This is a fine movie and a deep one. Its about unearthing buried treasure. The Men Who Stare at Goats ""The Men Who Stare At Goats"" stars George Clooney Jeff Bridges Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey. All of them look like theyre having lots of fun and their enjoyment promises to be infectious. After a while though the only sign of infection may be an urge to squirm. You may wonder if this screen version of the book of the same name is as unfunny and strangely mushy as it seems but trust your instincts. Theres no solid ground beneath the story of a secret U.S. Army unit that was dedicated to developing psychic powers. Its a goof about a bunch of goofballs. Jon Ronson the books author said the story was true; ostensibly sane citizens really did try to create a force of American soldiers with superpowers warrior monks who could make themselves invisible walk through walls or as a training exercise if nothing else kill a goat by staring at it. Yet demonstrable truth wasnt the issue. The pleasures of the book came from the craziness of the schemes the fervor of the crackpots who devised them and the steady skepticism of the prose. In the movie which was directed by Grant Heslov from a screenplay by Peter Straughan the two main crackpots played by Mr. Clooney and Mr. Bridges have become arch charmers and the tone is New Age whimsy with absurdist overtones by way of the Coen brothers and Wes Anderson. One of the superpowers under study involves remote viewing via extrasensory perception. I wish I could have viewed this movie remotely or not at all. The Fourth Kind Here are two true things about Olatunde Osunsanmis ""The Fourth Kind."" In the opening scene the actress Milla Jovovich introduces herself as the actress Milla Jovovich which she is--actually she says ""I am actress Milla Jovovich""--and announces that she will play a psychologist named Abbey Tyler which she does. What may be less than true is the actresss announcement that Abbey is a real-life victim of alien abduction and that scenes showing the real Abbey along with corroborating evidence from her terrified patients have been taken from really real documentary footage. Here are five other truths confirmed by the film whose title dares to one-up Steven Spielbergs (close encounters of the fourth kind going beyond mere contact with aliens into abduction by them) 1) Mr. Spielbergs reputation is safe. 2) Jittery hand-held cameras cant create drama only nausea. 3) Mr. Osunsanmis chutzpah exceeds his skill. 4) Mr. Osunsanmi is skillful all the same having made something out of little more than a clever idea in the hallowed tradition of ""The Blair Witch Project"" plus a couple of truly scary moments. 5) In the age of the Internet everything is true unless proven otherwise so ""The Fourth Kind"" will abduct a scary share of this weeks audience. The Wedding Song ""The Wedding Song"" takes place in Tunis in 1942 just as Nazis troops are occupying the North African capital. Karin Albous sensuous leisurely drama doesnt explore the setting so much as draw subdued energy from it. The center of the story is occupied by two girls coming of age in fearful circumstances Nour (Olympe Borval) who is Muslim and her best friend Myriam (Lizzie Brochere) who is a Sephardic Jew. Each girl envies the others life and their envy is equally misguided since the man Nour hopes to marry cannot match her romantic expectations while Myriams religion and the wealthy man shes being forced to marry threaten to be her undoing. A small-scale feature made with modest resources ""The Wedding Song"" seeks and finds larger meaning as a multipurpose parable of the Nazi message of hate that divides cherished friends of oppressed Arabs misapprehending the roots of their oppression and blaming oppressed Jews. The movies distinction however lies in two lovely performances and in the passion and pain of parallel lives--both girls suffering at the hands of men both struggling to understand the brutality of the world they must share. In a DVD recommendation last week I mistakenly said that Leslie Caron won an Oscar for her performance in the title role of the 1953 ""Lili."" The best-actress Oscar that year was won by Audrey Hepburn for ""Roman Holiday."" DVD FOCUS ""A Christmas Carol""(1951) ENLARGE Just in case you were wondering or somehow forgot this is the definitive choice among all the feature versions extant (though I do have a soft spot for Bill Murrays ""Scrooged""). Alastair Sim gimlet-eyed and gleefully acidulous is Scrooge Mervyn Johns is Bob Cratchit Hermione Baddely is Mrs. Cratchit Kathleeen Harrison is Mrs. Dilber and Michael Hordern is Jacob Marley in the flesh and as a ghost. The director was Brian Desmond Hurst. A colorized version is available for those who fancy heresy. For everyone else the black-and-white photography (by C.M. Pennington-Richards) does right by Dickens and puts subsequent shooters in the shade. ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977) ENLARGE Sometimes you just have to state the obvious. For all the times its been shown on TV re-released in theaters or repackaged on DVD Steven Spielbergs shining glowing masterpiece will never wear out its welcome. I watch it whenever it turns up and think of it whenever I drive the 405 freeway north from Westwood at night reach the crest of the hill and look down on the San Fernando Valley whose twinkling lights supposedly inspired the design of the films spaceship. Vilmos Zsigmond was director of photography and Douglas Trumbull supervised the visual effects. ""Days of Glory"" (2006) ENLARGE Foreign distributors found a forgettable English title for ""Indigenes"" an unforgettable drama about Algerian soldiers fighting in the French army in World War II. The French title translates to ""natives"" but with a strongly ironic connotation. The soldiers in question dust-poor volunteers from Algeria who had never set foot on French soil fought valiantly to liberate the motherland from Nazi rule. Yet their fellow French soldiers called them ""natives"" or worse used them as cannon fodder and saw them as subhuman scum. The spare sharp-eyed direction was by Rachid Bouchareb who worked from a splendid script by Olivier Lorelle.

Jedis with The Men Who Stare At Goats Not even Obi-Wan Kenobi can save these warriors from their muddled mind games.  |  1/2 out of 4 stars By Colin Covert Star Tribune November 6 2009 -- 216pm Laura Macgruder Associated Press - Ap In this film publicity image released by Overture Films George Clooney is shown in a scene from ""The Men Who Stare At Goats."" Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint A title card at the beginning of ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" announces ""More of this is true than you would believe."" Less of it is entertaining than you would wish. The lightweight satire based on a nonfiction book by British journalist Jon Ronson is a sort of New Age ""Catch-22."" It recounts a period in the 1980s when senior officials in the U.S. military the intelligence services and Washington began to believe bizarre things. The United States next wars would be fought with psychic powers levitating soldiers and spies who observed distant enemies by closing their eyes concentrating and waiting for the visions to come. In top-secret experiments soldiers tried to kill goats by glaring at them. True facts. With a premise this rich -- occult hoo-ha as an allegory for the insanity of war -- and a cast including George Clooney Jeff Bridges Kevin Spacey and Ewan McGregor how could the film go wrong? Dozens of ways actually and it stumbles flat-footed across every single one. Episodic structure slack tempo a clutter of characters and shaggy-dog subplots uneven acting and listless direction. Id rather stare at a goat for 93 minutes. The films point of view shifts unsteadily among narrators and time zones but the main focus follows McGregors Bob Wilton a small-town newspaperman who writes oddball human-interest stories. One of his assignments involves a local vet who tells ""Twilight Zone"" tales about a classified Army corps of ""psychic warriors."" Rebounding from a failed marriage Bob heads off to cover the early days of the second Iraq war where he encounters Lyn Cassady (Clooney) who was named by Bobs eccentric source as one of the Armys clairvoyant recruits. Lyn admits to Bob that his unit was called the ""Jedi masters."" ""Whats a Jedi master?"" McGregors character asks an Obi-Wan Kenobi meta-joke that the humor-strapped script recycles a dozen times. As Lyn and Bob infiltrate Iraq on a vague secret mission Lyn demonstrates superpowers such as ""cloud bursting"" gazing at thunderheads until they dissipate and taking credit for it. Hes less skilled at evading kidnappers or keeping his car on the road. (This is the only film Ive seen that uses an Improvised Explosive Device for a sight gag.) THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS  1/2 out of 4 stars Rating R for language some drug content and brief nudity. As they wander the desert the film drifts through its story. Flashbacks introduce us to eccentric officer Bill Django (Bridges in blissful ""Big Lebowski"" hippie mode) who founded the bloodless psychic warfare initiative after experiencing an epiphany (or shell shock) in Vietnam. We meet the tales villain nefarious Larry Hooper (Spacey) who wants to turn Djangos blissed-out long-haired mind commandos to his own evil purposes. Spaceys bad guy is so delighted with his own wickedness that you cant help being tickled too. The film comes apart in the final stretch with hokey redemptions and resolutions in place of real closure. The yarn unravels without ever identifying its satirical targets. Is it a lampoon of peace-and-love mysticism? A critique of militant war-for-profit privateers? Ultimately its a shapeless wad of goat cheese.

ABOUT THE MOVIEThe Men Who Stare at Goats   1/2 (out of four) Stars Ewan McGregor George Clooney Jeff Bridges Kevin Spacey Robert PatrickDirector Grant HeslovDistributor Overture FilmsRating R for language some drug content and brief nudityRunning time 1 hour 33 minutesOpens Friday in select cities By Claudia Puig USA TODAY Paranormal activity is not just the stuff of low-budget horror flicks. Apparently the military has its own use for psychic disturbances a concept that is explored and satirized in The Men Who Stare at Goats. Unorthodox and covert military practices easily lend themselves to dark comedy. And when military bigwigs seek to outwit and beat combatants harnessing a range of paranormal and psychic powers the potential for outlandish fun looms large. EWAN McGREGOR Goat-starer extraordinaire (Clooney too) TRAILER Take Goats for a test drive Based loosely on Jon Ronsons weirdly funny book of the same name the film has some of the farcical appeal and subversive wit of Dr. Strangelove. But its daffy humor - much of it provided by the deliciously loony performance of George Clooney- is sporadic. The unconventional tale derails about midway through wittiness dissipates and the story becomes a tedious road movie. Things perk up again in the final third when Jeff Bridges lends his outrageous faintly Lebowskian presence. A word about that mouthful of a title It refers to a training exercise in which a soldier believed to have superstar psychic abilities was said to have killed a goat simply by staring at it. The military supposedly kept a herd of the animals penned in a clandestine location just to experiment with this mind-control murder technique. Grant Heslov who wrote the masterful Good Night and Good Luck makes his directorial debut with this challenging military satire. While on the trail of a much more prosaic story journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) stumbles on to the use of experimental psychic phenomena in secret military quarters. Having been dumped by his wife for their mutual newspaper editor Bob is unexpectedly at loose ends. He is also fascinated by the implications of the story hes uncovering. Impulsively he dives into investigating the use of psychic powers against a military enemy egged on by the enigmatic dreamweaver of a ""New Earth Army"" fighter Lyn Cassady (Clooney). Cassady speaks in utter seriousness about throwing an enemy off guard by greeting him with ""sparkly eyes."" He also is the one who bores his killer eyes into the eponymous goat. The story bounces between the Vietnam-era 70s to the 80s and ultimately to 2003 and the Iraq War. The movies structural unevenness may be a result of screenwriter Peter Straughans addition of fictional elements to Ronsons droll and purportedly factual account of the U.S. militarys experiment with using mental and psychic skills for combat. Wilton was not in the book but those who lead him through the maze of oddball projects are based on actual military personnel. The scenarios posited are just specific and bizarre enough to be convincing luring the audience into its weirdly tangled web. This is the anti-Hurt Locker experience Where that Iraq War film was absorbing and deadly serious The Men Who Stare at Goats is irreverent and lighthearted. One only wishes it were a more consistently funny film. Posted Updated E-mail | Print | To report corrections and clarifications contact Reader Editor Brent Jones.

That is military operations that explore psychic and paranormal techniques to sway the enemy. The title refers to a training regimen in which recruits practice toppling livestock - just by standing there staring at the critters mightily. The opening credits card says it all ""More of this is true than you would believe.""Clooney is Lyn Cassady a clandestine ""warrior monk"" who comes out of retirement post-9/11 and keeps his skill sets honed by ""cloud bursting"" (staring at cumulus until it breaks up) and other simple telekinetic exercises. Its Operation Iraqi Freedom time and Cassady a self-described Jedi knight and ""remote viewer"" who may just be completely nuts is in the Middle East to do his part - and to seek out the legendary Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) a Vietnam veteran who several decades earlier preached flower-power philosophy to a special secret Army unit and who may or may not be in the combat zone. (Hes certainly in some kind of zone.)Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) is Djangos rival a Machiavellian military man leading his own psych-ops unit in the desert sands. Tagging along with Cassady from Kuwait City into Iraq is a small-time American newspaper reporter Bob Wilton (a likable Ewan McGregor) - the impartial observer and the movies narrator not quite believing the loopy shenanigans he finds himself in the midst of.Theres nothing terribly profound about The Men Who Star at Goats which makes the men doing the staring all the more endearing for the profound seriousness with which they go about their tasks - like trying to run their bodies through solid walls by sheer force of will. (If youve seen the TV spots and trailers youve seen the bandage on the bridge of Clooneys nose.) Clooney channeling Gable and Groucho is the perpetrator of several drop-dead-funny double-takes. Bridges seen in Vietnam-era flashback and various stages between then and now brings his Big Lebowski Dude-ness to the proceedings - a sublime stoner sensibility that spreads like second-hand pot smoke through the theater.The Men Who Stare at Goats has a glorious good time satirizing the extravagant lengths to which the military and intelligence establishments will go if they think theres a payoff at the other end. The film has been ably affably directed by Grant Heslov Clooneys Good Night and Good Luck writing collaborator and although the McGregor character voice-over device doesnt seem necessary it does provide a clinical perspective to all the nuttiness under way.Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or sreaphillynews.com.

The peace symbol may be the unofficial emblem of the 1960s but the yin-yang has proved to be the better choice. If that decade taught us anything it was that ""anything"" could be twisted. Push Woodstock a little bit one way and it became Altamont. Give the crunchiest commune the wrong leader and it became the Manson Family. Thats the lesson behind ""The Men Who Stare at Goats."" The Men Who Stare at Goats (R) Overture (90 min.) Directed by Grant Heslov. With George Clooney Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges Kevin Spacey. Now playing in New York. Stephen Whittys review TWO STARS Ratings note The film contains strong language drug abuse and brief nudity. Based very loosely on a few facts in Jon Ronsons nonfiction book of the same name the ironic adventure is about a real-life U.S. military program dubbed the New Earth Battalion. Its post-Vietnam New Age contention was that soldiers could use psychological (and psychic) tricks to win the hearts and minds of foreign peoples. Of course it soon became the strategy to use the same techniques to stop the hearts and cloud the minds of foreign peoples. The programs specially trained ""warrior monks"" -- who after ""Star Wars"" inevitably came to be called ""Jedis"" -- were supposed to be able to use telepathy divine hidden locations and stop and start their own hearts. Or other peoples. This is wild stuff and its not surprising that it drew the attention of Grant Heslov (who co-wrote ""Good Night and Good Luck"") and particularly that of his good friend George Clooney. Clooneys first directorial effort ""Confessions of a Dangerous Mind"" about game-show host and supposed CIA operative Chuck Barris showed an interest in crackpot conspiracies and surreal cloak-and-dagger shenanigans. His subsequent work as an actor in political films like ""Syriana"" and ""Michael Clayton"" (not to mention his off-screen humanitarian work) has revealed a fierce proud liberalism. ""Goats"" fails when it tries to satisfy both. The beginning is wonderfully off-kilter as reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) gets a tip on the Armys secret psychic-ops programs. The film delivers layers of quirky details (the reporter loses his wife to an amputee Lothario) and tells its story with casual good humor. That mood continues as Wilton finally travels to Iraq during the Gulf War and hooks up with rogue military man Lyn Cassady (Clooney) a mysterious character who seems to ping-pong between cloak-and-dagger paranoia and an unfounded faith in his own ESP. Yet almost as soon as the two men go off in search of a secret battalion they lose their way -- and so does the film. What had been a slightly quirky satire becomes first a wild comedy then an impassioned expose. Taking itself too seriously (and treating the military as a joke) it quickly begins to unravel. Its not helped unfortunately by its cast. Clooney can be a deft comic actor (he is superb in the upcoming ""Up in the Air"") but hes overly fond of playing (and overplaying) idiots and his inevitable approach is to make silly faces. These are caricatures not characters. Other actors are undone in similar ways. Its nice to see Kevin Spacey playing nasty again but the toupee hes been given sits on his head like a remnant of wall-to-wall broadloom. Meanwhile the casting of McGregor should have prompted a fast rewrite Having the man who played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the ""Star Wars"" prequels innocently (and continually) ask ""Whats a Jedi?"" is just corny overkill. ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" has its moments. Its a pleasure for instance to have Jeff Bridges back in full ""The Dude"" mode as the hippie-dippie military man leading on-base yoga classes; hes a sweet silly throwback to the early 70s. But so in its wild shifts of mood and overstated satire is the film. In the end its just another bad trip. Stephen Whitty may be reached at swhittystarledger.com or (212) 790-4435.

E-mail| Print| Reprints| | Text size - + The Men Who Stare at Goats prompts an obvious question Will there in fact be any goats stared at in this movie? And if so by whom and to what end? The answers - yes; George Clooney; to kill them by remote heart attack as part of a top-secret military initiative - are deliciously absurd even if you dont know theyre based at least partly in historical truth.You cant make this stuff up but you can botch the telling of it and thats what sinks this satiric drama based loosely on a 2004 nonfiction book by London-based journalist Jon Ronson. What could have been a shaggy-dog ""Dr. Strangelove for our times falls prey to a first-time feature director an unfocused script and a lead role thats both underwritten and miscast.Not Clooney; hes fine. Actually his Lyn Cassady - a rogue US Army psychic warrior - is the sort of part tailor-made for this star supremely confident a little nuts primarily reactive. Clooney works best when theres a Normal for him to bounce off; here that Normal is journalist Bob Wilton a fictional stand-in for Ronson who (unlike the author) is American and whos played by British actor Ewan McGregor with a vaguely East Coast accent that should never have made it through Customs.Its the early days of the 2003 Iraq invasion and Wilton is trying to embed himself in-country to prove his macho bona fides to an ex-wife who couldnt care less. The journalist meets Cassady whos posing as a private contractor but whose true identity as a veteran of the shadowy New Earth Army is soon smoked out.Whats the New Earth Army? Imagine that a Vietnam veteran in the early 1970s dropped out did a ton of drugs absorbed every New Age bromide the Left Coast had to offer then created an experimental unit of hippie warriors trained in psychic arts like ""remote viewing (i.e. ESP) and yes the ability to stare goats to death. In the real world the ""First Earth Battalion never made it past a training manual that was then co-opted by the US military for psychological warfare and other nefarious purposes. In the movie - well we get Jeff Bridges playing ""The Dude Goes to War.Bridges is cast as New Earth Army mastermind Bill Django a ponytailed peacenik fox let loose in the Pentagon henhouse. The richest most weirdly funny scenes in ""The Men Who Stare at Goats are the flashbacks to the secret units training sessions in which recruits Clooney (with long hair about as convincing as McGregors accent) Stephen Root and others let their inner pagans loose mastering the ""sparkly eyes technique and dancing about like teenage girls at a Grateful Dead concert.Djangos shamanistic maxims pepper the script like hilarious smart bombs - ""We must become the first superpower with super powers ""Be all you can be ""The US Army has no alternative but to be wonderful. When Cassady successfully deploys a small plastic widget that ""can hurt you a hundred different ways (it looks like an ice scraper) the movie finds its groove the place where Americas spiritual yearnings and killer instincts meet and intertwine.But its early yet and the groove gets lost. Cassady leads the reporter deeper into occupied Iraq and ""The Men Who Stare at Goats becomes a cracked buddy movie Hope and Crosby in ""The Road to Baghdad. One problem is that McGregors character isnt funny or even interesting. A larger problem is that Grant Heslov directing his first feature after writing ""Good Night and Good Luck (as well as producing other Clooney movies) loses his way in the scripts many crosscurrents.At some point ""The Men Who Stare at Goats has to become about what weve done in Iraq - about how the pacifist ideals of the NEA have been warped by the modern Army - and it turns both preachy and confused. Kevin Spacey barely shows up for his role as the units designated snake in the grass; the tone shifts from psychedelic ""Catch-22 to hectic sub-Altman chaos.Heslov wants us to laugh at the New Earth Armys hippie-dippy vision and embrace it at the same time and hes just not that agile a director. The movie collapses a disappointing case of coulda-been. Still it leaves a moral worth treasuring Free your goats and your mind - and country - will follow.Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

The Men Who Stare at Goats Fair to good Director Grant Heslov. Cast George Clooney Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges. Rating R for language some drug content and brief nudity. Qamp;A Jeff Bridges Spotlight George Clooney Movies about Iraq and the Middle East R-rated comedies New movies this week 11/02/09 It probably should have been more a satire of war with a sharper bite. But the rip-roaring look at the implausible but evidently true(ish) paranormal methods of war used by the United States military coasts along so agreeably on the strength of performances by George Clooney Jeff Bridges and Kevin Spacey that its only later that youll scratch your head and wonder how much of what youve just seen really happened and how you ought to feel about it. (More ""than you would believe"" a title card tells us at the beginning.) ""Goats"" is based on Jon Ronsons non-fiction book. The filmmakers have added a character reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) whose life in Ann Arbor Mich. is lacking on just about every front. So in 2002 after a curious interview with a decidedly odd fellow (Stephen Root never not good) he sets off for Iraq hoping to score a major story. During the earlier interview hed been told about an elite unit of fighters who use their minds instead of weapons. He runs into Lyn Cassady (Clooney) the most gifted of the paranormal soldiers in Kuwait City. Cassady at first brushes Wilton off then takes him on a black-ops mission in Iraq. Theyre kidnapped traded to other kidnappers and eventually escape. Are Cassadys powers the reason they get away? Happily director Grant Heslov (who wrote ""Good Night and Good Luck"" with Clooney) doesnt tip his hand. Maybe its all legit maybe Cassady is crazy. Works out the same either way. Before they run into some of Cassadys old unit and the story takes a turn Heslov walks us by way of repeated flashbacks through the history of the New Earth Army. Founded by Bill Django (Bridges in hippie mode) the unit eventually falls into disrepute thanks to the poisonous scheming of the jealous Larry Hooper (Spacey) one of its members. (Note his hilarious wedding toast.) Before that happens however were treated to grooved-out versions of Bridges and Clooney long hair whipping in the air as they dance like fools - just one of the methods they use to reach inner consciousness or whatever freak-flag state it is theyre trying to attain. It sounds loony of course but Cassady in particular seems to really be onto something. Clooney invests the character with an absolute belief in what hes doing; when he says they were ""Jedi warriors"" he means it. His performance falls somewhere between the goofball nuttiness he employs for the Coen brothers and the more serious take he uses in other roles. Hes good - hes always good and for someone so famous hes actually underrated as an actor - but he never quite finds equilibrium between the two. The same can be said of the film which fizzles out by the end. Its a lot of fun if uneven along the way there and by the finish Wilton seems sure he has learned something. Im just not sure the rest of us do. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm. Twitter goodyk.

The movie is one of those over-the-top absurdist antiwar ""satires"" that are inevitably likened to Dr. Strangelove though a better comparison might be the fractious madcap-incoherent film version of Catch-22. The Men Who Stare at Goats was directed by Grant Heslov (he worked with Clooney as a producer on Leatherheads and Good Night and Good Luck) but in this case ""directed"" is a charitable word. Spinning out the tall tale of a battalion of New Age paranormal soldiers who were trained during Vietnam to don cloaks of ? invisibility kill goats with their minds and generally turn war into a groovy thing Heslov slaps gags together and never begins to find a point of view. Actors like Jeff Bridges (in a ponytail) and Kevin Spacey (in the worst hairpiece of his career) jabber away as if locked in their own private acting classes and Ewan McGregor as the reporter who tags along with Clooney when the troop is revived to help fight the war in Iraq (see its a topical movie) looks about as lost as youll feel. The Men Who Stare at Goats is a magical-realist sitcom war farce that ends up being about nothing but its own slovenly smugness.

Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; men-who-stare-at-goats-the ) Men Who Stare at Goats The (United States/United Kingdom 2009) November 01 2009 A movie review by James Berardinelli Welcome to George Clooney season. Those who find the actor who has been described by some as a modern day Cary Grant engaging will have reason to smile as Hollywood begins its annual push toward the Oscars. Clooney will bring his winning personality and high-wattage smile to no fewer than three productions with Academy Award aspirations. Fantastic Mr. Fox and Up in the Air are yet a short distance down the road but The Men Who Stare at Goats has arrived. Not only does it have the strangest title of the three late 2009 Clooney vehicles but the storyline is also probably the most bizarre. That title - The Men Who Stare at Goats - is in and of itself an indication that this movie is not directed squarely at mainstream multiplex-goers. Its hard to imagine an army of 14-year old boys and their dates lining up to see this movie which is designed with a more sophisticated audience in mind. The film is more than a little odd but it has fun with its offbeat premise and moves along breezily until it gets bogged down in the third act. (Watch out for the appearance of Kevin Spacey - thats when the momentum starts to flag as a more direct focus on narrative undermines some of the wit and comedy.) The Men Who Stare at Goats opens with the following caption ""More of this is true than you would believe."" But isnt truth always said to be stranger than fiction? We are introduced to Ann Arbor journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) who is looking for the story of his life; he wants to impress his wife who has unceremoniously dumped him. His quest leads him to Kuwait where he hopes to become embedded with a group of troops entering Iraq. There he meets Lyn Cassady (Clooney) an ex-Special Ops military officer who claims to have been part of the ""New Earth Army"" a covert group of ""psychic spies"" who use their ""Jedi mind powers"" to influence others. Cassady agrees to take Wilton with him on a mission across the border. Along the way he tells him about the New Earth Armys history and its commanding officer Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) who ran a very different kind of unit. The first half of The Men Who Stare at Goats is superior to the second half. For about 45 minutes the film is content to play with the absurdity of the concept of having a covert group of ""psychic spies."" It also works brilliantly as a parody of the military and its rules and structure. Unfortunately past the midpoint the movie begins to pay more attention to plot and when it does this the humor erodes. The more The Men Who Stare at Goats focuses on developing and advancing the narrative the less enjoyable it is because Cassadys ""mission"" turns out to be rather uninteresting. The director of The Men Who Stare at Goats is Grant Heslov. This is his feature debut behind the camera but not his first opportunity to join forces with Clooney. He co-wrote (with Clooney) and produced Good Night and Good Luck and filled similar producing duties for Leatherheads. The two men clearly know each other and work well together and it shows in the easy way this movie unfolds. Heslov is not performing without a net. Who better than Clooney to lend a helping hand - a man who has learned from Soderbergh and the Coens and directed three films in his own right (two of which he collaborated with Heslov)? The movie contains one of the best in-jokes of recent times. The psychic spies go by a number of different names among them the ""remote viewers"" and the ""Jedis."" This allows for multiple references to Star Wars. Of course it will be lost on no one in the audience that Ewan McGregor played none other than the young Obi-Wan in the prequel trilogy. So this creates a little amusement every time McGregor and Clooney discuss the Jedis and Jedi powers. McGregor provides us with this quote ""Whats a Jedi Warrior?"" He then ends up pursuing the path of the Jedi in the end. It would be interesting to know whether Heslov and screenwriter Peter Straughan were aware of McGregors pending involvement when those lines were written. If they were it was an amusing way to work in one of the actors most (in)famous roles. If they werent it was a case of an eyebrow-raising coincidence. Fans of The Big Lebowski which has achieved a major cult status since its theatrical release will note similarities between Bill Django and the ""The Dude"" of the earlier film. Both are played by Jeff Bridges who has apparently drawn from the same wellspring of inspiration for these laid-back New Age-y parts. The Men Who Stare at Goats is enjoyable to watch ""in the moment"" but it doesnt leave a powerful or lasting impact at least insofar as the comedic elements are concerned. (Re-watching it a second time after initially seeing it a month earlier at the Toronto Film Festival I was surprised how fresh the humor was - mainly because I didnt remember most of the jokes.) As entertaining as the production is however the fact that it contains a kernel of truth reminds us of one damning truth This is the kind of thing that American tax dollars are being spent on. The Men Who Stare at Goats is a comedy and I laughed quite a few times while watching it but that sobering reality almost makes me want to cry.

(AP Photo/Overture Films Laura Macgruder)-- AP+Read Caption In this film publicity image released by Overture Films Kevin Spacey is shown in a scene from ""The Men Who Stare At Goats."" (AP Photo/Overture Films Laura Macgruder) / APShare Photo A fun tone is undermined by disjointed storytelling in George Clooneys ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" and it all starts with the disclaimer that opens the movie ""More of this is true than what you might imagine."" This wry comment serves as a nod and a wink from the filmmakers a license to do what they will to Jon Ronsons amusing nonfiction account of the U.S. militarys hush-hush research into psychic warfare and espionage. What Clooneys producing partner first-time director Grant Heslov and his colleagues come up with is a hit-and-miss fictional narrative on which to string some of the brightest anecdotes Ronson uncovered about efforts to create warrior monks who try to walk through walls or glare animals to death. The priceless opening scene - recreating the start of Ronsons book as a general attempts to displace his molecules and run through his office wall - promises a Catch-22 or Strangelove-style satire. But the book is a loosely connected journey from one absurdity to the next sprouting offshoots and asides great stand-alone burlesques and dramas that dont lend themselves to a cohesive film. The dramatic spine developed by screenwriter Peter Straughan jettisons much of the books darkest and most-compelling moments - a CIA murder plot psychic warfare links to the Branch Davidians and the Heavens Gate cult suicides - in favor of a gag-laden jaunt stretching from Vietnam through the war on terror. Delivered with goofy gusto by Clooney and co-stars Jeff Bridges Ewan McGregor and Kevin Spacey ""Goats"" is fitful undemanding and ultimately lightweight humor. Something of a stand-in for Ronson McGregors Bob Wilton is a reporter who stumbles onto the story of the New Earth Army founded by Vietnam vet Bill Django (Bridges) the pioneer of New Age techniques meant to give his troops a spiritual edge and superpowers to win over enemies - or wipe them out. Djangos prize pupil is Lyn Cassady (Clooney) whom Wilton accompanies through a series of mishaps on a mission in Iraq. Inspired by real people Ronson encountered Cassady and Django have the scent of authenticity about them. Not so with Wilton and his awkward ill-defined motivations for uncovering the story or with Spaceys Larry Hooper a psychic rival to Cassady whos a stiff contrivance meant to add tension. The fictional plot line isnt terribly interesting though its nicely ornamented by little farces lifted from the book - a guy convinced that the Loch Ness monster is the ghost of a dinosaur another who advises that Angela Lansbury somehow knows the whereabouts of Manuel Noriega (it was Kristy McNichol in the book but same chuckle nonetheless). The actors carry baggage that creates some unfortunate distractions. Clooney at times seems like a cross between his Desert Storm operator from ""Three Kings"" and his looney-tunes Odysseus from ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" Django plays a bit like Bridges Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"" had he joined the Marines. McGregors ""Star Wars"" connection proves jarring as the film incorporates Ronsons references to psychic warriors as Jedi knights. Its cute once but the repeated Jedi-speak in the presence of Obi-Wan himself grows tiresome. In fits and starts director Heslov captures a lot of the drolly incredulous spirit of the book. Its just too bad the dots dont connect better. ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" an Overture Films release is rated R for language some drug content and brief nudity. Running time 93 minutes.

By Anthony Lane Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges and George Clooney in Grant Heslovs movie.   Credit Illustration by Pablo Lobato Can the human mind be used as a weapon of war? It would be cheaper than a pilotless drone for one thing though not necessarily smarter. Those who wish to pursue this exciting possibility are advised to see ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" which is based on a book by the British journalist Jon Ronson. What Ronson discovered in his researches was a section of the United States military that was solely and specifically tasked with mental combat. ""More of this is true than you would believe"" an opening title declares. What a tease. Our Ronson-like protagonist is an American reporter named Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor). He works in Ann Arbor but craves a wider beat; the craving takes him to Iraq or at any rate to a Kuwaiti hotel. There he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney) who claims to be one of the Jedi Warriors men who stared at goats until they--the goats that is not the men--fell down dead. (""Whats a Jedi warrior?"" Wilton asks. So thats why McGregor was hired for the sake of an in-joke.) Staring was just one of the indispensable skills that were drilled into Cassidy and his comrades years before by Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) who vowed ""We must become the first superpower to develop super powers."" Django was a ponytailed visionary--if thats not a tautology--who following an epiphany in Vietnam founded the New Earth Army in order to establish whether love and peace can win wars. The answer is ""They cant"" but that didnt stop his recruits from trying to run through walls or the government from sponsoring the program. Most of these training sessions are viewed in flashback. The films director Grant Heslov flips constantly between the Django regime and the recent situation in Iraq as Cassidy--who says he has been reactivated--crosses the border with Wilton in tow on a mission too secret to be revealed. If Heslov and his screenwriter Peter Straughan prefer to linger on the early days of the unit its because that is where the action is or was. Hence the quick perfect scene in which an ambitious psychic named Hooper (Kevin Spacey) congratulates the happy couple at a wedding reception and adds ""Sorry it doesnt work out between you two."" At moments like this the movie feels rich in satisfactions. To watch actors as nimble as Bridges Clooney and Spacey clashing wits as if they were lightsabers is precisely the kind of fun--grownup fun delivered by men not kids and lit not by special effects but by a serious love of the joust--that I demand from Hollywood and for the most part no longer get. Each man vies to be the most deadpan determined to present his character a solemn clairvoyant fruitcake as nuttier than the rest. Clooney is probably the winner here even turning to McGregor and wielding the famous ""sparkly eyes"" technique as taught to super-spies without a smirk. The most handsome and capable star in the world and he doesnt mind coming across as a total dork. Its not fair. Its also not fair that the movie lets him down. Clooney gives it everything but what does he get in return? A void where the story is meant to be. For a while everything ambles along like a mashup of ""Three Kings"" the 1999 Clooney film about the first Gulf War and the Three Stooges with Heslov dishing out roof tumbles car smashes and cheek slaps. Much of this is neatly framed--an eye poke for some reason is funnier in long shot--and you sit there for an hour in good humor waiting for the narrative to stop noodling around and get going only to realize to your consternation that its winding down. In truth there just isnt enough motion here to sustain a motion picture. The material is a gift Considering the mileage that Robin Williams got out of ""military intelligence"" for his radio riffs in ""Good Morning Vietnam"" you can imagine the glee with which he would have feasted on the news of psychic soldiering. As for Joseph Heller its only the thought that some targets are just too pitifully easy that might have restrained his hand. In both cases however the Jedis would surely have supplied no more than a telling subplot or a skit. After all its not as if they ever achieved anything. Late in the day efforts are made to knock up a makeshift finale. In a covert facility in the desert Wilton and Cassidy the logic of whose actions is roughly half of that allotted to Hope and Crosby in ""Road to Morocco"" stumble upon Django and other figures from the past. We get a communal acid trip--always a clear sign of a movie with nowhere to go--followed by pounding volleys of rock music as a herd of goats which have been shot at rather than merely stared at are set free together with a cluster of orange-suited enemy prisoners who have been tortured. This sideways glance at a deeply uncomical and still potent issue is one hell of a misstep on Heslovs part. Having urged us to take nothing seriously throughout how can he expect us to switch for a couple of minutes to a thoughtful and disapproving frown? What is this ""Road to Guantanamo""? Safely back in America Wilton pledges to ""tell everybody what happened."" But thats the problem Bob. Nothing did. Please make sure when you buy a ticket for ""Precious Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire"" to pronounce the title in full. I know you will. There was a plan to call it ""Push"" until another movie got there first. But why not call the new one ""Precious"" and leave it at that? After all Deborah Kerr didnt star in ""The Innocents Based on the Novella The Turn of the Screw by Henry James"" and Dustin Hoffman didnt star in ""Rain Man Based on the Overwhelming Desire to Win an Academy Award by Dustin Hoffman"" so why the change in rubric? The heroine is Clareece Jones (Gabourey Sidibe) a Harlem teen-ager better known as Precious. She is grimly overweight her face so filled out that the play of normal expression seems restricted; yet Sidibe does wonders with that sad limitation and we learn to spot the flare of anger in her eyes. She has much to be angry about aged sixteen she already has one child who has Down syndrome and is carrying another. The father is her own father who later turns out to be H.I.V. positive. We are forced to watch as she is violated in livid closeup complete with squeaking bedsprings a belt being unbuckled above a sweating belly and--lest the seething aggression of the rape escape us--a shot of eggs sizzling in grease. If the subject were not so grave you would be tempted to laugh at this desperate overkill of detail. Does the director Lee Daniels not realize how such industrial-strength images tend to weaken rather than fortify the moral case? Expelled for being pregnant Precious seeks alternative schooling at Each One Teach One a local program for those undesired elsewhere. Her classmates especially Jo Ann (Xosha Roquemore) whose favorite color is ""fluorescent beige"" and Rhonda (Chyna Layne) with her fabulously broad Jamaican accent are the most naturally uplifting people in the film--far more so than their teacher Blu Rain (Paula Patton) whose powers of uplift feel like make-believe. She is a vision of tolerant gentleness who wears a new set of soft fabrics every day and plays Scrabble in the evening with her equally lovely lesbian partner. ""They talk like TV stations I dont watch"" Precious says but that tart line is not borne out by the film which drinks in Ms. Rain without demur. The same goes for the fantasy sequences--hugely ill-advised dream clips showing a richly clad Precious at a movie premiere or slow-dancing with a hunk. One of them even finds a slender white girl gazing back at her from the bedroom mirror. What we have here is a fouled-up fairy tale of oppression and empowerment and its hard not to be ensnared by its mixture of rank maleficence and easy reverie. The gap between being genuinely stirred and having your arm twisted however is narrower than we care to admit. What rescues ""Precious"" is the performance of MoNique as Mary the heroines Medusa-like mother. Given her range of leisure interests--smoking cursing channel surfing baby tossing munching pigs feet and throwing televisions down the stairs--there is no reason that the character should be more than a vicious cartoon. But MoNique gives tremendous life to this dead soul makes you wonder where her own misery sprouted from and closes the proceedings with a monologue of selfishness so storm-driven that for a second despite ourselves we are almost swept away. Sitting opposite during this tempest is a social worker Mrs. Weiss (Mariah Carey). Hold on a stern song-free compassionate piece of acting from Mariah Carey? That sounds like one of Preciouss fantasies but its for real.  Anthony Lane has been a film critic for The New Yorker since 1993.

The lower-case ""tiff"" the color of a pumpkin blares from posters and billboards throughout the city as a symbol of festival director Piers Handlings determination to simplify everything including the logo in a movie orgy that has clearly outgrown itself. Last year the sheer bloat of this annual circus inspired accusations of ""elitism"" and complaints that a beloved event started by three movie buffs in 1975 was ""no longer the peoples film festival."" This year in the midst of a hobbling global recession the goal is to ""return the festival to the people"" as 312 feature films flow through every projector in the city from 9 a.m. screenings for priority press to midnight-madness horror flicks featuring the latest assortment of infectious viruses rampaging zombies and flesh-eating ghouls for the unwashed masses toting sandwich bags and styrofoam cups from Starbucks. (The projectionists sleep from 2 a.m. to dawn.) I dont know about a return to simpler days but there is certainly something here for every taste. You can see documentaries about Hugh Hefner and Glenn Gould; endless tracts on the war in Iraq; Michael Moores latest assault on capitalism (blame it all on Bushs bank bailouts); Drew Barrymores making her directorial debut with Whip It starring Ellen Page on roller skates; a vampire musical called Suck; Jewish liturgy from the Coen brothers; and another loathsome barf job by Danish wacko Lars von Trier called Antichrist in which pickle-faced Charlotte Gainsbourg who always looks embalmed prunes away her genitalia with garden shears. Naturally it will show up shortly in the New York Film Festival the official depository for movies nobody wants to see where torturing the audience has become an acknowledged priority. Despite the volume of product there is evidence wherever you turn that the fat has been trimmed. Recession-cautious buyers are stoic and roughly 100 of the films on display have arrived without any distributors at all. Unlike Cannes which has an actual film market resembling a tag sale Torontos deals are more informal with the buying and selling done on cell phones and in hotel lobbies. Hollywood studios are scaling back on the swag. There are fewer exclusive dinners midnight cocktail soirees corporate sponsors red-carpet premieres limousine rentals and hairdresser appointments. Nobody seems to care much about shelling out money even for bragging rights. But George Christys coveted annual lunch at the Four Seasons went on as planned; Matt Damon hosted another charity benefit for underprivileged kids; and Joan Baez gave a free concert in the middle of the street. This year the lavish party circuit is taking a back seat to the movies and glam venues like the Rosewater Supper Club and Ultra have a lot of blank pages in their reservation books. Never mind. Swag or no swag the boldface names are here anyway. Spotted in full gridlock on the red-carpet runway Demi Moore Ann-Margret Norman Jewison Mariah Carey Ewan McGregor Jeff Bridges Keanu Reeves Viggo Mortensen one-name-is-all-you-need Oprah assorted Colins (Farrell and Firth) Jennifers (Connelly and Garner but not Aniston) and Michaels (Caine Douglas Moore and J. Fox). Not to mention Bill Murray Patricia Clarkson Christopher Plummer Penelope Cruz Clive Owen Edward Norton Chris Rock Nicolas Cage Robin Wright Penn and others too famous to mention. They only stay long enough to suffer through the idiotic press conferences pose and then head for the airport. Some of them dont even have movies to plug. Theyre just here for the photo ops. George Clooney is everywhere with his hand in a bandage--a good excuse for not signing autographs. Jane Fonda is not here but sent some controversy in her place. When she heard about this years sidebar event honoring Israeli films and the city of Tel Aviv she signed a protest letter attacking the Israelis and defending Palestine which elicited an enraged response from Jon Voight her co-star in Coming Home who accused a deluded Jane of once again backing all the wrong people. Result A series that stood every chance of being ignored suddenly had a new focus of world interest. Too bad Jane and cohorts like Harry Belafonte and Wallace Shawn didnt know one of the films they boycotted was a collaboration between Israeli and Pakistani co-directors. I skipped Triage an Irish war drama with Colin Farrell as a wounded front-lines freelance photographer in Kurdistan (he lost 25 pounds for the role by living on black coffee cigarettes and two cans of tuna per day) and opted for a live auction where one of the prizes was tea with Diane Lane to ""talk Hollywood world issues and life."" Dont ask. WOLFING DOWN CLUB sandwiches and Yoo-hoos you finally try to see some movies. After years of bad advice from festival brochures and eager press agents experience (and failing eyesight) have taught me to cross off some contenders early just from the synopses like the one that ""tells the story of 13-year-old Gunther growing up in the 1980s in a household of drunks gamblers and womanizers in small-town Belgium."" Or how about ""an alcoholic actress trying to put her life together"" and ""a young mother struggling to shake a drug habit""? Sometimes the titles alone will do it (Bitch Slap Women Without Men The Men Who Stare at Goats). In all the clutter I have still managed to see some amazing films. If Toronto sets the tone for the forthcoming awards season you can plan ahead for a few riveting performances and welcome surprises. You also better plan to dress up for depression. Viggo Mortensen gives the performance of his career in the faithfully rendered film adaptation of Cormac McCarthys heartbreaking apocalyptic novel The Road. After an unspecified global catastrophe wipes out most of the world including his wife (Charlize Theron) a desperate father (a gaunt Viggo) in an attempt to stay alive takes his son on a long and dangerous journey to the sea across a burned-out America encountering cannibalism rape and other bleak nightmares amid the last remnants of human life (Robert Duvall and Guy Pearce among them). Artistically rendered by director John Hillcoat sensitively adapted by Joe Penhall hauntingly shot in many of the post-Katrina landscapes in southern Louisiana and wonderfully acted (especially by Viggo whose face has been described as an El Greco etching) The Road is a tremendous achievement. George Clooney is unveiling two alleged ""comedies"" simultaneously--one good the other an insufferable disaster. In Jason (Juno) Reitmans smart cynical and witty Up in the Air the suave Hollywood film personality his fans have erroneously labeled ""the new Cary Grant"" plays a cool emotionally detached and swellegantly groomed businessman whose job is to fly around America downsizing companies and firing people. Hes a termination specialist whose only goal in life is to rack up 10 million frequent flyer miles. But fate intervenes when he meets a tough cookie played by the fantastic Vera Farmiga and all bets are off when he breaks his own rules falls in love against his better judgment and finds his heart. The payoff (a basically venal character who deceptively appears to have everything already reevaluates his career priorities when he learns how much hes been missing) is not as sappy as it sounds and the ending is a kick in the shins. Up in the Air often looks like an American Airlines commercial and I wouldnt call it a feel-good movie per se but theres a certain satisfaction watching two snappy beautiful people at the top of their form. Mr. Clooney has never looked better acted with more confidence or oozed more charm but hes no Cary Grant.

A serendipitous marriage of talent in which all hearts seem to beat as one ""The Men Who Stare at Goats"" takes Jon Ronsons book about ""the apparent madness at the heart of U.S. military intelligence"" and fashions a superbly written loony-tunes satire played by a tony cast at the top of its game. Recalling many similar pics from ""Dr. Strangelove"" to ""Three Kings"" and the screwy so-insane-it-could-be-true illogic of ""Catch-22"" this is upscale liberal movie-making with a populist touch in Coen brothers style. Enthusiastic welcome at Venice likely to be echoed at Toronto should translate into friendly biz Stateside in November. Coming in at a tight well-paced 93 minutes Grant Heslovs second feature -- after his little-seen anti-corporate golf comedy ""Par 6"" (2002) -- clearly benefits from his close working relationship with star George Clooney following their writing collaboration on ""Good Night and Good Luck."" It also benefits from the dense but pacey screenplay by Brit playwright Peter Straughan whose credits include ""How to Lose Friends and Alienate People"" and ""Mrs. Ratcliffes Revolution."" ""Goats"" is officially ""inspired"" by Ronsons book which accompanied a three-part docu series shown on Blightys Channel 4 in late 2004 called ""Crazy Rulers of the World"" tracing some of the U.S. militarys more outre ideas for policing the world terrorism in particular. Straughans screenplay takes many of the stories from the book -- apparently true per Ronson whos made a career from recounting ""true tales of everyday craziness"" -- and as a way into the material invents the character of a small-time Ann Arbor Mich.-based journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) whos desperate to get into Iraq at the time of the Bush invasion. After a comically cautionary intertitle (""More of this is true than you would believe"") and an opening gag (repeated with a variation at the end) that immediately sets the tone the first reel is thick with info and time shifts from the present (starting in fall 2002) back to the early 80s which are a tad difficult to digest on first viewing. In a nutshell Wilton assigned to interview Gus Lacey (Stephen Root) an apparent wacko who claims he has special psychic powers stumbles across an even crazier story Back in the 80s the government had a top-secret unit of ""psychic spies"" who were trained to kill animals by staring at them. The most gifted of the group says Lacey was a certain Lyn Cassady. Wilton heads for the Middle East in spring 2003 looking for a good war story. Stuck in Kuwait City he bumps into ""Skip"" (Clooney) who initially claims to be an Arkansas trashcan salesman but is actually Cassady whos been reactivated and is on a super-secret black-op mission to Iraq. As the two bond and Wilton persuades Cassady to take him along its clear Cassadys elevator stops well short of the top floor. Claiming to be a ""remote viewer"" ""Jedi warrior"" and several other things in between Cassady fills Wilton in on the formation 20 years earlier of the New Earth Army brainchild of a Vietnam vet-turned-New Age hippie Bill Django (Jeff Bridges with goatee and pigtail). In one sequence straight out of the Joseph Heller playbook the U.S. military decided to adopt Djangos New Earth manual written with liberal doses of LSD as a new template for ways of policing the globe. ""We must be the first superpower to have super powers"" exhorts Django setting up a squad of psychics he dubs ""warrior monks."" As the pic flip-flops between flashbacks illustrating Cassadys narrative and the present time the pair get lost in the desert kidnapped and traded by terrorists and then lost again in the desert. Meanwhile the backstory progresses to a point where one new member Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey) tried to sabotage the NEA prepping the movie for its acidly funny climax. Incredibly dense screenplay traverses not only 20 years of U.S. military abitions starting in the Reagan era but also provides its own riffs on such public scandals as Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. What saves it from getting dramatically tripped up by its own populist grandstanding are the leading perfs which motor the movie far more than the messages. As the completely nuts Cassady Clooney anchors the movie in a beautifully calibrated demo of comic timing and sheer physical presence. More than just his nebbish straight man McGregor has some of the best lines slicing through Clooneys utter self-conviction with a handful of well-chosen words. Bridges channeling ""The Big Lebowski"" fits Django like a glove and Spaceys appearance midway adds some welcome tartness to all the New Age weirdness. Robert Elswits beautifully composed widescreen lensing of New Mexicos deserts (standing in for Iraq) and Puerto Rico (repping Vietnam and other locations) is aces without dominating the characters. Other tech credits including Tatiana S. Riegels smoothly succinct editing are top drawer. End crawl stresses that though some characters are based on real people (the New Earth Army was reportedly the idea of a certain Col. Jim Channon) the movie is a work of fiction. Yeah right.
