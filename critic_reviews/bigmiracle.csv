Daily Edition Login to download Big Miracle Film Review 1107 AM PST 2/1/2012 by Michael Rechtshaffen FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Universal Pictures A whale of a cast helps bring this energetically expansive true-life rescue tale home. TWITTER Directed by Ken Kwapis and based on the 1988 story about a family of gray whales the Universal film stars Drew Barrymore John Krasinski and Ted Danson. The generically nondescript title aside Big Miracle is an enjoyable lively account of an Alaskan animal rescue story that touched the world. Using a broad generous canvas to recount the events surrounding the 1988 plight of a family of gray whales who become ice-locked off the shores of Barrow Alaska director Ken Kwapis and screenwriters Jack Amiel and Michael Begler demonstrate an eye for playful period detail but its the affable cast headed by Drew Barrymore and John Krasinski that really makes the picture so widely accessible. With its all ages appeal the Universal release could see some buoyant box office along the lines of last falls Warner Bros. adventure Dolphin Tale. PHOTOS The Big Screens Evolution of Talking Animals Based on the novel Freeing the Whales by Thomas Rose the film efficiently establishes its brisk tone and equally brisk Arctic Circle setting where local TV news reporter Adam Carlson (Krasinski) covers the quality of the guacamole at the towns only Mexican restaurant. His dreams of making it into the bigger markets are realized when he stumbles across three whales trapped beneath the ice with a single ever-shrinking hole providing their only oxygen supply. Carlsons footage of the whales plight initially captures the attention of his ex-girlfriend environmental activist Rachel Kramer (Barrymore) who quickly takes up the cause. PHOTOS 23 Awards Contenders Featuring Animals So does Tom Brokaw who runs the story on his NBC Nightly News telecast and all of a sudden everyone wants to be in the whale-saving business for very different self-serving reasons. With its socio-political ramifications that travel far beyond the snow banks of Barrow the story also attracts the attention of everybody from the Alaskan Native population to a pro-oil-drilling businessman (Ted Danson) to the Reagan White House looking to position vp George H.W. Bush as a pro-environmental humanitarian and even the Glasnost-promoting Soviets. Theyre all given the same even-handed treatment by Amiel and Beglers script and while  character complexities tend not to run too deeply below the surface theres more than enough for Kwapis and his talented cast to utilize to their advantage. Both Barrymore and Krasinski are terrific and credible both in their respective lines of work and as still-involved former couple. Good too are Danson; Dermot Mulroney as a steadfast National Guardsman in charge of transporting a gigantic hoverbarge in an ill-fated rescue mission; and Vinessa Shaw as persistent White House executive assistant Kelly Meyers. Also enjoyable are all those 1988 touches from the clunky Walkmans to Gordon Gekko references while those real-life broadcasts by Brokaw Dan Rather Peter Jennings and company have been nicely integrated into the dramatic recreations. On the subject of recreations New Zealand-based special effects artists Justin Buckingham and Mike Latham do a sufficiently convincing job of bringing those California gray whales to life (they served a similar function on 2002s Whale Rider); while veteran cinematographer John Bailey crisply captures all that still frosty terrain and steel blue sky.

Credit Rhythm amp; Hues/Universal Pictures Who wouldnt want to save the whales? Maybe an oilman more interested in drilling rights than in wildlife. Or Inupiat Eskimos whose close relationship to whales includes hunting them. Or the governor of Alaska uneager to risk human lives to save seemingly doomed animals.In Ken Kwapiss ""Big Miracle"" these unlikely allies find themselves doing something unexpected trying to save three California gray whales trapped in the ice near Barrow Alaska. Also lending hands are a Greenpeace worker two Minnesotans with a portable de-icer the Alaska National Guard the Reagan administration the Soviets and even a journalist or two.""Big Miracle"" gets off to a shaky start but once revved up it becomes an involving work-against-the-clock-and-the-odds action movie. Inspired by actual events from 1988 the film shows the race to save the whales and comes with a family-friendly reach-across-the-aisle message When people put aside politics and ill will they can accomplish something they could never manage alone.""Big Miracle"" is savvy enough to allow that many of the people pitching in do so for reasons other than altruism and it is sentimental enough to have those characters changed by their commitment to the cause. The oilman (Ted Danson) wants the good publicity he gets from helping. He also falls in love with the whales and even finds that his nemesis the Greenpeace activist Rachel (Drew Barrymore) isnt so horrible after all. (Back at ya says Rachel.) But bad things do happen. Spoiler and brace-yourself alert the baby whale Bamm-Bamm doesnt make it.The movie halfheartedly includes a romantic-triangle plot. Adam (a warm John Krasinski) the journalist who breaks the whale story has a crush on a Los Angeles newscaster (Kristen Bell) covering it too. Adam is also Rachels ex. But mostly ""Big Miracle"" sticks to the rescue tale.Sometimes the attention focused on this problem in a small corner of Alaska can seem far-fetched but Mr. Kwapis reminds us that it really happened by cutting in period footage of Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw delivering updates. The plausibility meter swings the other way when President Reagan seen from the back starts a phone conversation with Mikhail S. Gorbachev like this ""Gorby? Its Ronnie."" Gorby though is fine with it he sends a Soviet ice-breaking vessel to help. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""Big Miracle"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some strong language and the death of Bamm-Bamm the whale.

John Krasinski bleached of his usual hipster irony and all the more likable for it plays the TV reporter who first spies the whales poking their noses up through a hole in the ice in order to breathe. Spearheading the rescue mission is Rachel Kramer a Greenpeace activist played by Drew Barrymore and I have to give credit to Barrymore for coming on not as a cuddly saintly savior but as just the sort of person who has an abundant compassion for whales because shes got so many neurotic issues with the human animal. Intercut with actual period news reports delivered by Dan Rather Tom Brokaw and Connie Chung Big Miracle wants to be a nostalgic tale of how back in the good old 80s everyone could come together when it mattered. At times the movie is like a cheesy rabble-rouser made in the 80s. What separates it from say Free Willy is that on the surface at least the film has an amiable cynicism. Its hook which becomes a running joke is that everyone who participates in the rescue mission is in it for his or her own selfish motives. The Greenpeace activist has her eco-princess self-righteousness. The greedy oil man (Ted Danson) who agrees to lend his hover barge to break up the ice is just looking for some environmental-friendly PR. Yet by the time President Reagan enlists the Soviets for help by picking up the phone to say ""Hello Gorby its Ronnie"" the movie has become a we-are-the-world lovefest. Big Miracle is harmless enough but whats annoying about it is its aura of fake activism. The movie doesnt seem to get that its exactly when the news media began to devote more time to subjects like whales that it started to turn into news not for activists but for couch potatoes.

This kicked off a major rescue attempt with Inuits Greenpeace journos tourists the oil industry the US government and most significantly a Russian ice breaker all helping out. Many agreed the exercise was a fine example of what can be achieved when opposing parties set aside their differences for the benefit of a common cause.TV director Ken Kwapis (who helmed some of the US version of The Office) milks that idea for all its worth in this dramatised reconstruction which pitches a diligent Greenpeace activist (Drew Barrymore) against a mean-spirited oil baron (Ted Danson) while attempting to liven up a series of repetitive events with some romance and punch-the-air moments. By-the-book dialogue and lame performances do the film no favours but hey worse things happen at sea.

There was no white reporters from KTUU-TV from Anchorage at the start of the whale story. The screenwriters of aEURoeBig MiracleaEUR removed from existence the Inuit EskimoaEUR(tm)s accomplishments at the very beginning of the whale saga. The screenwriters chose to make this more a caucasian movie about white people coming to the rescue in the beginning of the movie. There was no outsider white people at the meeting of Inuit whale hunters to talk them out of harvesting the whales. It was strictly an Inuit decision done without white people giving any persuasive speeches. There was no Greenpeace person in that meeting at all. In my opinion the movie aEURoeBig MiracleaEUR is racist and bigoted bringing to mind the old cowboy and Indian movies. In the aEURoeBig MiracleaEURoe version Inuits are given the credit for cutting holes in the ice while the all knowing and caretaking white people make all the major discoveries and decisions.

Universal created new names for all the top people involved in the rescue. They even invented a new name for the Governor of Alaska in 1988. For example the Greenpeace womans name is really Cindy Lowery not Racheal Kramer played by Drew Barrymore. The real governors name was STEVE COWPER not Governor Haskell. The real guy who shot the video in Barrow played by John Krasinski as Adam Carlson was actually the government TV Studio Manager of the North Slope Borough Oran Caudle. The big oil executives name was Bill Allen of VECO not Liam Peterson played by Ted Danson. And so on and so on... It would have been better if Universal had used the real names. I guess that is why they advertise ""Inspired by"" instead of ""based on"" the book by Tom Rose. Im still going to go see it.

"Big Miracle review Another miracle on ice |       NJ.com comments Big Miracle review Another miracle on ice Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on February 03 2012 at 744 AM View/Post Comments Animal-loving volunteer Rachel Kramer played by Drew Barrymore offers comfort to one of the trapped whales in the rescue adventure aBig Miraclea inspired by a true story. Big Miracle"" is a modest pleasure. But a welcome one. Aimed squarely at animal lovers -- and family audiences -- its the squeaky-clean based-on-fact story of how three migrating whales got stranded outside a tiny Alaskan town in 1988 and how disparate forces came together to help get them on their way. Its a nice corrective to the bloody destroy-the-brutes violence of that other recent Alaskan picture ""The Gray"" -- and a rare example of a kid-friendly movie that adults and 9-year-olds can watch together without either group getting too bored. The story is told from the point of view of John Krasinski playing a TV reporter stuck in the backwater burg of Barrow. At least it would be a backwater if it ever unfroze. Mostly its just ice Eskimo fishermen and wind. But then that family of three whales gets stuck. And majestic as they are theyre going to need a push to get out. In the end its a pretty motley crew who pitches in -- all at first for their own reasons. Like Drew Barrymores Greenpeace activist. Like Kristen Bells ambitious Los Angeles journalist. Like the towns Eskimos who still hold on to a reverence for the animals they hunt. And like the Reagan White House the Kremlin and a big oil man who are all are looking for some good press. And two Minnesota yokels you betcha who think this is the perfect opportunity to show off their new invention a deluxe de-icer. Thats a lot of balls to keep in the air at once but director Ken Kwapis -- whose better films include ""Hes Just Not That Into You"" and ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"" -- is good at handling multiple story lines. He has some appealing stars here too primarily Krasinski who has a loose lovely charm. And Ted Danson who is a marine-ecology activist in real life is having way too much fun playing the guiltless (but not entirely heartless) big businessman. Barrymores whale-hugger unfortunately isnt quite as much fun to watch or listen to; she seems to have confused passion with bad grooming and her voice manages to be at once shrill and babyish. But even the smallest parts are filled by pros -- James LeGros Kathy Baker John Michael Higgins Stephen Root and Tim Blake Nelson. And the period details are spot-on (if youve ever found yourself daydreaming about 80s-era news anchors like Garrick Utley -- and really who hasnt? -- this is the place to turn). ""Big Miracle"" is hardly brilliant. A section focusing on a regular American familys reaction to the crisis goes nowhere. Scenes featuring a Ronald Reagan ""look-alike"" -- who isnt and is shot from behind like in those old movies about FDR -- are awfully corny. I suspect a lot of critics will give the film the back of their hand. But as a parent theres something refreshing about a kids movie that manages to get through its entire length without a poop joke. And something undeniably sweet -- especially these days -- about a story that shows people finding ways to overcome their differences however briefly just to do one good thing. Ratings note The film contains some drinking and mild language. Big Miracle (PG) Universal (107 min.) Directed by Ken Kwapis. With Drew Barrymore John Krasinski. Now playing in New Jersey.

That would be ""Big Miracle"" a family-friendly drama inspired by the true story of highly publicized efforts in 1988 to free three gray whales trapped inland by ice in Alaska near the Arctic Circle. One doesnt want to oversell the movie -- no one is going to be mentioning this one come Oscar time next year -- but if youre looking for a passable film to take the kids to this weekend ""Miracle"" offers a smart enough take on its feel-good plot to keep adult viewers tuned in. The movies basic story is grounded in fact in the fall of 1988 the attempts to free three trapped whales an adult male and female and their baby in tiny Barrow Alaska turned into a huge international story. The film directed by Ken Kwapis (""Hes Just Not That Into You"") focuses on various folk some based on real persons and some fictional who are trying to free the whales. They include Adam Karlson (John Krasinski) a nice guy local TV reporter; Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore) a Greenpeace advocate who is Adams former girlfriend; J.W. McGraw (Ted Danson) an oil company bigwig who aids the rescue effort; and Nathan (Ahmaogak Sweeney) a local Eskimo boy whose grandfather is trying to teach him the old ways. The cast is competent with Barrymore and Danson making the biggest impressions. She does so by giving her underwritten heroine edge portraying her as sometimes irritating and over-zealous and he with his amusing strutting as a puffed-up smirking captain of industry. What ""Miracle"" does especially well is to mix inspiration with hard-nosed politics. It makes clear that while trying to save the whales was laudable and a publicity coup for its various participants the financial cost -in the millions- was exorbitant. It also deftly illustrates how varying and sometimes opposing political agendas come into play as each group tries to use the rescue effort to their own advantage. The White House (during the final months of the Reagan administration) hopes to enhance its dismal environmental record by encouraging the rescue efforts. Greenpeace sees a chance to raise its profile an oil company wants to generate positive publicity and the indigenous population of Barrow profits from the sudden influx of reporters by charging exorbitant rates for hotels and food. The movie is less effective in portraying the rekindled love story between Adam and Rachel which gets short shrift amidst the rescue efforts and politics. News junkies will be amused by and feel nostalgia for the many contemporaneous clips that pop up featuring bygone network news anchors including Peter Jennings Connie Chung Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw. And near the end of the movie there is a humdinger of a Sarah Palin joke thats all the more effective because it is slipped in without fanfare and will go unnoticed by those unfamiliar with her brief stint as a TV sports anchor early in her career. - Breaking News To Your Inbox.

Its a true story though youd never guess that its based on a 1989 book ""Freeing the Whales"" with this cynical subtitle ""How the Media Created the Worlds Greatest Non-Event."" Lets forget that little germ of truth shall we? In this telling television freelancer Thomas Rose who wrote the book after covering the elaborate 1988 rescue of three California gray whales stranded near Barrow Alaska is replaced by a cuddly Krasinki as Adam Carlson a gosh-aroonie type who specializes in irony-free reportage (""Amigos the northernmost Mexican restaurant in the world""). Adam can always be trusted to throw down his camera and join a good cause especially when his ex-girlfriend Greenpeace staffer Rachel Kramer (Barrymore) shows up.

There are residual traces of realism as when reporters descend on Barrow to bite chunks off the story and Cold War politicians including a Reagan sound-alike begin smelling possibilities for good PR. But director Ken Kwapis (""Hes Just Not That Into You"") insists on false warmth at every turn even forgetting that in 50-below weather you ought to see a breath cloud or two.

Liam Lacey The Globe and Mail Published Friday Feb. 03 2012 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 223PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Better and more acerbic than its title would suggest Big Miracle is not just another cetacean liberation movie in the mould of Dolphin Tale and the trio of Free Willy movies. In fact its a screwball comedy with a possible debt to Preston Sturgess 1942 film The Miracle of Morgan Creek a movie inspired by the Dionne quintuplets and similarly set in a small town turned upside down by media and political showboating. Screen grab from the online trailer for ""Big Miracle"" starring Drew Barrymore John Krasinski and Kristen Bell Movies Big Miracle The official trailer In this Jan. 6 2012 photo actress Kristen Bell poses for a portrait in New York. Bell stars in the series ""House of Lies"" airing Sundays at 10 p.m. EST on Showtime. AP Celebrity The Wattage Meter How bright are these stars shining? In 1988 NBC showed footage on its newscast of three California grey whales trapped in the ice near Point Barrow Alaska and a media frenzy erupted eventually bringing together Greenpeace the National Guard a big oil company local whale hunters and the U.S. and Soviet governments in a rescue effort. Adapted by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler from Thomas Roses account of the incident ( Freeing the Whales How the Media Created the Worlds Greatest Non Event) the movie is introduced in voice-over by worldly 11-year-old Inuit boy Nathan (Ahmaogak Sweeney). He has recently befriended a visiting TV reporter Adam (John Krasinski of TVs The Office) whos finishing a weeks worth of stories on life in a northern village where oil drilling may soon replace hunting if a local oil-company CEO (Ted Danson) has his way. Opposing the drilling is environmental activist Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore) Adams former girlfriend. When Nathan convinces Adam to shoot one last story Adam looks through his video camera viewfinder and suddenly notices the whales two adults and a juvenile trapped in a patch of open water the size of a small backyard swimming pool. His story ends up on the evening news and to use a term not yet discovered goes viral. (In a nice touch the film uses original news footage of the events from the then three major American networks - with Tom Brokaw Dan Rather and the late Peter Jennings.) A swarm of journalists floods into town paying inflated costs for food and hotels standing about on the ice hoping for the whales escape so they can leave town as well. The local whale hunters consider harvesting the whales but take the PR-conscious role of rescuers instead. Everyone else jumps on the bandwagon.. After Rachel pushes the governor (Stephen Root) to get the National Guard to help the oil-company executive (Danson) steps in with a plan to have helicopters tow a barge to the site to break the ice. When that fails President Reagan calls on his new friend Mikhail Gorbachev to bring in a nearby Soviet icebreaker. With the broadly silly satire as a backdrop the film focuses on a romantic triangle as Adam is drawn both to Rachel the single-minded activist and Jill (Kristen Bell) a sexy Los Angeles reporter who is here to make her name with this glorified ""cat in a tree"" story. Krasinski who manages to seem both self-effacing and persistent Barrymore as a passionate carer and Bell as a Barbie-with-brains make an appealing threesome. Their repartee is more reminiscent of director Ken Kwapiss work on television shows such as The Office and Parks and Recreation than his weak movie comedies ( Licensed to Wed Hes Just Not That Into You). Big Miracle is not one of those whale tales that leaves the audience blubbering but its open to the allure of the imposing creatures which resemble long boulders that have come to life. The whales are represented here with a combination of animatronics CGI wild footage and best of all the footage from the original rescue operation.

Its an exciting charming and often quite funny family film inspired by the real-life 1988 rescue of three gray whales trapped in ice near Alaskas northernmost point. Its also a romantic comedy -- as well as a surprisingly sharp satire about environmental politics and the media. At the center of this three-whale circus is Drew Barrymore at her most endearing as a fictionalized version of Greenpeace activist Cindy Lowry (renamed Rachel Kramer). Rachels (fictitious) ex-boyfriend (John Krasinski) a local TV reporter from Anchorage breaks the news that local Inuits have discovered the family of migrating whales stranded in a tiny ice hole five miles from the ocean. As an army of reporters from around the world descends on tiny Port Barrow the confrontational Rachel goes to work recruiting an unlikely army of rescuers many of whom are actually unconcerned about the fate of the whales. Whats especially interesting is that ""Big Miracle for all of its corny touches makes it very clear that these unlikely allies are participating (at least at first) strictly to burnish their public images garner votes and/or land drilling contracts. Among them are an oil mogul (Ted Danson) the Alaska National Guard pilot (embodied by Dermot Mulroney) and the Reagan administration (top- ranking aide Vinessa Shaw). There are also the Inuits who are worried about having their whale-hunting rights curtailed unless they help out. Except maybe for wide-eyed Krasinski (who has his own big-time ambitions) the assembled media are no less cynical -- a ruthless young LA reporter (Kristen Bell) double-crosses her own anchorman (John Michael Higgins) in pursuit of a whale scoop. With all of this going on ""Big Miracle"" director Ken Kwapis (""Hes Just Not That Into You"") never loses focus on the increasingly desperate rescue efforts as the weather worsens and options to free the whales run out. They range from helicopters towing a huge ice-breaking barge across hundreds of miles of ice to a pair of wacky Minnesota inventors arriving with a home-made device they claim will keep the hole from freezing over in minus-50 degree weather. Even when screenwriters Jack Amiel and Michael Beglers own inventions border on the bizarre -- Rachel swims in subfreezing water with the whales to free the youngest from a net and Krasinskis character thaws someones frozen eyelid by licking it -- the movie is never less than thoroughly entertaining. You could probably cut the Barrymore-Krasinski romantic plot (theres another more factual one between the Mulroney and Shaw characters) but they do bicker becomingly and have terrific chemistry together. Ive usually found Krasinski an annoying presence on the big screen but hes a perfect foil for Barrymore here. The huge excellent cast (Tim Blake Nelson Kathy Baker and James LeGros all turn up) includes Ahmaogak Sweeney very good as an Inuit youngster who serves as films surrogate for juvenile audiences. Kids will love the plentiful whale scenes with remarkably convincing effects work by the New Zealand firm that did ""Whale Rider. In the end its up to President Reagan no less to decide whether to call in a Soviet destroyer from the ""Evil Empire for a Hail Mary effort to unblock the whales last obstacle to the sea. Given the films spoiler-ish title its not exactly a surprise when the bit actor playing the Great Communicator picks up the phone and drawls ""Oh Gorby . . ."" ""Big Miracle also has a potpourri of terrific archival news footage for 80s nostalgists eager to see Dan Rather Connie Chung Peter Jennings and Tom Brokaw in their prime. And stick around during the closing credits for a clip with Joey Buttafuoco (Barrymore once played his girlfriend Long Island Lolita Amy Fisher in a TV movie). And appearing with Krasinski through digital wizardry a former Alaska TV weather girl who went onto bigger and better things. History? Sorta. Fun? You betcha.

Starring Kristen Bell Drew Barrymore John Krasinski Tim Blake Nelson Mark Ivanir Stefan Kapicic Director Ken Kwapis Running time 203 Release Opened Feb 3 2012  Editorial Review Saving the whalesBy Stephanie MerryFriday Feb. 3 2012In this highly partisan era when common ground seems to be located somewhere in the Bermuda Triangle its comforting to revisit 1988 when people from many backgrounds stumbled upon a unifying goal. What issue could possibly ally Greenpeace activists and oil executives big-city journalists and rural Inuits even Reagan and Gorbachev? The sweetly beguiling ""Big Miracle"" based on a true story has the answer three whales. As the family-friendly adventure opens television reporter Adam Carlson (John Krasinski) is hard at work uncovering the fluffiest of feature stories in Alaskas frigid confines. After a hard-hitting segment on an avocados journey to a small-town restaurant Adam stumbles upon a potentially career-changing story. Gray whales - a mother father and baby - have become trapped under ice while making their annual migration south. The mammals only temporary salvation is a circular break in the frozen surface through which they occasionally pop up for air. But without human intervention and some way to get them to ice-free water the whales will be dead in days. Adams news flash brings an influx of visitors to the Arctic Circle. The circus includes a smarmy oil tycoon (Ted Danson); a comely Los Angeles-based reporter (Kristen Bell); Adams ex-girlfriend a militant Greenpeace advocate (Drew Barrymore) and a couple of goofy yet enterprising Minnesotans who specialize in de-icing. Each has his or her own interests in mind but all ultimately agree to help figure out how to save the whales. Politics are politics however. When the last resort turns out to be Soviet aid its hard to say what the next move will be. Cold War-era bonding over whales? It would sound utterly absurd if it werent based on fact. And thats part of what makes this movie fun for adults. This is a look back at a time when a big-shot executive might have barked ""Have the girls put out a press release"" or a military commander crow ""Ill be damned if Im going to let those Reds come in here and save the day."" Archival news footage adds credence to the fictionalized retelling. (Be on the lookout for a Sarah Palin cameo from back in the day.) Where kids are concerned the story has the necessary ingredients for a good squeaky-clean action/adventure. Plans are hatched then scrapped during the race against the clock; lessons are learned; gaps bridged. But the movie generally avoids melting into a fondue of sentimental cheese and teachable moments. Part of that is thanks to the first-rate cast which keeps things breezy. Krasinski delivers lines with an ease that perfectly mimics witty everyday banter while the rest of the impressive roster features Stephen Root Rob Riggle and Tim Blake Nelson none of whom are generally associated with kids fare. Some of the politics not to mention the increasingly crowded playing field of characters and plot lines could prove to be a bit much for very young children. During a Saturday morning screening some little ones got restless around the 80-minute mark. But the harrowing finale should reset short attention spans. As the minutes tick down the sentimentality picks up. But chalk that up to the enigmatic creatures which grab hold of human hearts no matter ones politics or affiliations. Whales just have a way of bringing people together. If only there was a way to bring orcas and belugas into more congressional debates.Contains mild language and mature themes.

Their plight drew global attention and inspired people from disparate corners to work together to free the majestic beasts. Though there were public-relations political and financial gains underlying some of the human involvement there also was genuine concern for the animals and the film captures that albeit in a clunky if well-intentioned way.STORY Drew Barrymore finds a Miracle in AlaskaIts certainly a worthy saga. But given the abundance of one-dimensional human portrayals it becomes apparent that a documentary on the subject might have been more powerful. The most natural of the name-brand actors is John Krasinski as Adam Carlson a TV reporter from Anchorage who is the first to spot the trapped behemoths after catching a whale spout in the background of a shot. Carlson interacts with the local Inupiat townspeople in a believable way befriending young Nathan (Ahmaogak Sweeney). When the story focuses on the on-again/off-again romance between Carlson and Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore) a Greenpeace activist given to sanctimonious sermonizing it feels particularly forced. Their chemistry is nil. It gets worse when Kristen Bell enters the scene as ambitious Los Angeles-based reporter Jill Jerard. Even less interesting are the subplots involving oil tycoon J.W. McGraw (Ted Danson) who goes from glad-handing villain to almost-saintly good guy and no-nonsense National Guard Col. Scott Boyer (Dermot Mulroney) who strikes up a romance with Reagan administration staffer Kelly Meyers (Vinessa Shaw).Director Ken Kwapis seemed to draw upon the interlacing vignette style of his Hes Just Not That Into You in how he approaches the human cast.Its as if the filmmakers figured that the story of saving the whales wouldnt be powerful enough on its own unless padded with almost cartoonish depictions of bland romances and superficial political machinations. The Exxon Valdez oil spill is referred to lightheartedly and Sarah Palin has a cameo from her television news days. Those calculated elements detract from the essential story of the whale rescue which was plenty powerful in itself. Nicknamed Fred Wilma and Bamm-Bamm the movie whales are a blend of archival footage computer-generated imagery and animatronic marine animals.When the film trains its focus on the magnificent whales -- crusty with barnacles and photographed beautifully particularly underwater -- the story sails along splendidly.

Credit Rhythm amp; Hues/Universal Pictures Who wouldnt want to save the whales? Maybe an oilman more interested in drilling rights than in wildlife. Or Inupiat Eskimos whose close relationship to whales includes hunting them. Or the governor of Alaska uneager to risk human lives to save seemingly doomed animals.In Ken Kwapiss ""Big Miracle"" these unlikely allies find themselves doing something unexpected trying to save three California gray whales trapped in the ice near Barrow Alaska. Also lending hands are a Greenpeace worker two Minnesotans with a portable de-icer the Alaska National Guard the Reagan administration the Soviets and even a journalist or two.""Big Miracle"" gets off to a shaky start but once revved up it becomes an involving work-against-the-clock-and-the-odds action movie. Inspired by actual events from 1988 the film shows the race to save the whales and comes with a family-friendly reach-across-the-aisle message When people put aside politics and ill will they can accomplish something they could never manage alone.""Big Miracle"" is savvy enough to allow that many of the people pitching in do so for reasons other than altruism and it is sentimental enough to have those characters changed by their commitment to the cause. The oilman (Ted Danson) wants the good publicity he gets from helping. He also falls in love with the whales and even finds that his nemesis the Greenpeace activist Rachel (Drew Barrymore) isnt so horrible after all. (Back at ya says Rachel.) But bad things do happen. Spoiler and brace-yourself alert the baby whale Bamm-Bamm doesnt make it.The movie halfheartedly includes a romantic-triangle plot. Adam (a warm John Krasinski) the journalist who breaks the whale story has a crush on a Los Angeles newscaster (Kristen Bell) covering it too. Adam is also Rachels ex. But mostly ""Big Miracle"" sticks to the rescue tale.Sometimes the attention focused on this problem in a small corner of Alaska can seem far-fetched but Mr. Kwapis reminds us that it really happened by cutting in period footage of Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw delivering updates. The plausibility meter swings the other way when President Reagan seen from the back starts a phone conversation with Mikhail S. Gorbachev like this ""Gorby? Its Ronnie."" Gorby though is fine with it he sends a Soviet ice-breaking vessel to help. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""Big Miracle"" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested).

Starring Drew Barrymore John Krasinski Ted Danson and Tim Blake Nelson. Directed by Ken Kwapis. (PG. 107 minutes. At Bay Area theaters.) There are stories that by their very nature force you to confront the possibility that people arent entirely horrible. Case in point In 1988 three whales got themselves trapped in Alaska. They were 5 miles away from the ocean breathing through a small opening in the ice but within days everyone knew that opening would freeze over and the whales would drown ... unless a lot of people got together and did something about it - immediately. The story of that incident is recounted in ""Big Miracle"" a title that doesnt exactly leave much room for suspense. It is the real-life (though Hollywoodized) account of how environmentalists politicians soldiers foreign governments Alaskan tribesmen and the news media teamed up to save the whales but thats not the part that speaks well of humanity. The encouraging - and curious - part of the story is that people were genuinely interested all over the world. Its a nice thought that when given the facts and no personal interest in thinking otherwise people will instinctively take the side of life over death. ""Big Miracle"" is about how the rescue attempt was brought about by a confluence of various interests. John Krasinski plays a TV reporter mired in the frozen backwater of Alaska who sees the story as his ticket to the lower 48. Ted Danson is a drill-happy oilman who recognizes the publicity advantage of getting out in front of the rescue effort. Various elements in the Reagan administration see this as an opportunity to bolster a fairly weak environmental record and the local Eskimos figure out that if they choose to eat the whales rather than help them they will be perceived as bloody savages. Related Stories Review Big Miracle Only Drew Barrymore as a Greenpeace honcho is in it entirely for the whales but then thats good that theres only one selfless person around. Instead of this being a story of a bunch of lovely people doing a lovely thing its rather the story of average people who become much better people as a result of doing a lovely thing even though some start out doing it for less than noble reasons. Watching the film I had no recollection of the 1988 news story though I had a pretty good idea how things would turn out mainly because they didnt call the movie ""Three Dead Whales"" despite that titles obvious box office appeal. In the absence of suspense the filmmakers challenge was holding the audience despite the atmosphere of inevitability. They set out to do this in two ways - first by following the various and fascinating trails of self-interest as they miraculously converge. (If anything that was the true big miracle that everyone knew theyd benefit.) And second by sticking to the story itself which was full of crises and turning points. The strong emotions at play are good but the movie veers at times into schmaltz and some comedy shorthand feels lazy and dumb - as when two brothers from Minnesota who invented an ice melting machine are treated like a pair of comic bumpkins out of ""Fargo."" Director Ken Kwapis skates too much on the surface making obvious choices but he is rescued in this tendency by Barrymore Dermot Mulroney (as a National Guard colonel) Tim Blake Nelson (as a wild life expert) and even Krasinski all of whom have a real instinct for the truth. ""Big Miracle"" is not the most sophisticated adventure film but compared with most family movies its practically something out of Noel Coward. E-mail Mick LaSalle at mlasallesfchronicle.com.

A pod of vulnerable whales suffer while conflicted humans bicker over whether or not -- and how -- to help before eventually riding to the rescue. But the movie has enough of a sense of irony to cut through some of that cheesiness. There may not be a second of say Whale Riders lyricism (thats still the best whale movie out there) but this energetic family movie is less insipid than it looks. Although Big Miracles edge had to have been cultivated by director Ken Kwapis (whose movies include the non-edgy Hes Just Not That Into You and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants) some of it comes from a objective journalistic account. In October of 1988 reporter Tom Rose covered the sad case of three California grey whales that didnt get out of the Arctic before winter and would have died in the ice near Barrow Alaska were it not for a Herculean human effort. Rose then published Freeing the Whales How the Media Created the Worlds Greatest Non-Event which looked at the political maneuvering between oil men Greenpeace activists Inuit natives and the leaders of the U.S. and U.S.S.R. as reported by his fellow greedy-for-air-time journalists. Roses original title may seem positively quaint in our world full of Snookis and Kardashians but what a piquant contrast it poses with a new paperback version of Roses book revised reissued and going by the movies faux-inspirational title. (PHOTOS This Fragile Earth--Ecosystems Affected by Global Warming) John Krasinski plays Adam Carlson yet another portrayal of an incredibly nice guy who should be immediately taken home to mom. Hes the soul of amiability and I loved seeing him lick another mans frozen eyelid open but maybe Krasinski needs to hook up with someone like Drives Nicolas Winding Refn to lively up his resume. A fledgling reporter from the Anchorage station Adam is about to escape a season of banishment in Barrow when the whales turn up poking their heads up through a tiny hole in the ever-thickening ice. Theyll never make it to the open ocean five miles away and the somber (arent they always?) tribal elder Malik (John Pingayak) declares them likely goners. Adam cuts together a story. It plays in Anchorage hits the feed and after a producer in New York notes that Brokaw is ""a sucker for fish stories"" the trapped whales become national news. Kwapis incorporates old clips of Tom Brokaw Peter Jennings and Dan Rather into the story. Theyll be like aliens to your children but what a trip to see them the media princes of the past seeming so young vital and essential. (MORE Top 10 Heroic Animals) The whales themselves dont get great screen time. Theyre just barnacle-covered animatronic heads that nudge out of the water every few minutes to serve as window dressing to various human dramas including sparks between Adam and his Greenpeace activist ex Rachel (Drew Barrymore) and Adam and Jill (Kristen Bell) an aggressive TV reporter from Los Angeles whose hair is shellacked into a veritable jib. There are some annoying extraneous threads to the story including repeat shots of a California family that gape at the TV coverage and seems strangely trapped in 1960s decor. Every predictable note gets struck. Of course sage tribe member Malik will drop to his knees and begin whale prayers. Of course the swarmy oil executive (Ted Danson) will commune with nature and develop a soft spot for the cute Greenpeace chick. But there is a slyer side to Big Miracle which positions itself as almost an equal opportunity mocker (though it has a liberal bent). Amidst all the touchy feely whale talk it offers commentary on life in Alaska the place where ""a high school dropout can make 200000 working on a rig"" and natives collecting stipends from the government for oil rights can blithely charge reporters 20 for a piece of cardboard to put under their feet while doing standup interviews on the ice. Only Adam Malik and the whales come up smelling like roses. As for 80s hindsight Reaganites beware. ""I couldnt hear you over the sound of the booming economy"" says Kelly (Vinessa Shaw) a Reagan aide sniping at Rachel sweet Rachel of the adorable political fervor. Theyre arguing mostly over the idea of asking the Soviets who have an icebreaker near by for help. No one likes it not even Rachel who points out the Russians have a terrible track record where whaling is concerned. But it seems like the best option and if Kelly blocks it Rachel says ""Im going to tell them that Ronald Reagan killed those whales."" Match point. There may be no role Barrymore is better suited to than that of sanctimonious environmentalist. Rachel is feather light miles from the actress recent attempts at something more serious (Grey Gardens) but Barrymore flits merrily back and forth between the activists tendency to superiority and sincere good intentions. Stay for the outtakes so you can get a peek at the woman she was playing along with the people who were the basis for Krasinski and Shaws characters as well as the stoic Natural Guardsman played by Dermot Mulroney (who also appears in The Grey; hes having a chilly year). And whatever you do even if the kids are demanding the bathroom dont leave before you get a chance to enjoy the Sarah Palin gag.

Its the late 1980s. All across America families are glued to their TVs as a daring rescue attempt unfolds over many frantic hours. With innocent life imperiled the whole world extends its hands and its prayers.No this is not the story of Jessica McClure the Texas toddler famously stuck in a backyard well. If the new movie ""Big Miracle is to be believed the most riveting story of the 80s was three migrating California gray whales stranded beneath miles of ice far above the Arctic Circle.It doesnt matter if many of us will have a hard time recalling this ""based on a true story event. ""Big Miracle doesnt need us to swallow its hyperbole as fact. It needs only to entertain. And that it does thoroughly leaving us both charmed and enriched without feeling very preached at. Praise be.Ken Kwapis the director whose credits include ""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants and numerous episodes of ""The Office goes at ""Big Miracle with a combination of big- and small-screen weapons. Its probably not fair to call this ""Free Willy meets ""Northern Exposure but its pretty accurate. And its a compliment really. Kwapiss movie has that unapologetic atta-boy spirit. Its also playful without being silly.Adapted by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler from a book (""Freeing the Whales) by Thomas Rose ""Big Miracle puts two humans at the center of its tale. Adam (John Krasinski) is a cub TV reporter doing his time in Barrow Alaska where big news is the arrival of avocados at the towns first/only Mexican restaurant. One day while out in the field Jack spots the trio of whales spouting through a small hole in the ice. His story is picked up by the greater media. Next thing you know Tom Brokaws talking about it on the ""Nightly News.Enter Rachel (Drew Barrymore) Jacks ex-girlfriend and an impassioned Greenpeace activist who blows in with the subtlety of a blizzard. Rachel is determined to rescue the whales - now tagged Fred Wilma and baby Bam Bam - and to get the job done she is willing to pressure greedy oil tycoons (Ted Danson looking more like a Q-Tip every day) crusty National Guardsman (Dermot Mulroney) and skeptical Inupiaq whalers (led by John Pingayak). Outwardly shes a broad caricature - no makeup (that stuff is animal tested) severely damaged hair a wardrobe pulled from the linty bottom of the 80s closet (not just a cowl-neck sweater a mustard-colored cowl-neck sweater). But what makes her more than a cartoon besides Barrymores considerable powers as an actress is that she always seems clear-eyed and in on the joke. We can laugh rather than roll our eyes when Rachel gets a Deep Throat-like phone tip from ""a friend of the whales. We can weep when she makes the case for caring so deeply about these ""big but vulnerable creatures. Krasinski is Krasinski or at least he is Jim from ""The Office - a lovable mensch who might covet more glamorous jobs and girls (in this case Kristen Bell as a Barbie-doll broadcaster on the rise) but who will always land with both feet on the ground pointed in an admirable direction.Back to those trapped whales A variety of forces mobilize to save them and ""Big Miracle has quite a lot of fun with the politics and interests at play. There are hilarious references to Ronald Reagan and those in his presidential orbit (""Gorby its Ronnie begins one phone call seeking help from a Russian ship) plus one late unlabeled cameo that Im still chuckling over. When a plan to drag in an icebreaking hover-barge by helicopter fails the Alaskan locals break out their chainsaws and start carving a five-mile path of holes that will lead the whales to freedom. Bam Bam is fading fast which parents should understand means closeups of his injuries and (spoiler alert) no Hollywood ending for this ""little one. The movie employs convincing animatronic whales and takes significant dramatic liberties especially in the final act but its closer to the real story than most viewers will realize until the postscripts roll.Last falls endearing ""Dolphin Tale set a high bar for family films of this kind. (One not met by the recent ""We Bought a Zoo which had more pedigree than heart or humor.) ""Big Miracle isnt as genuine as ""Dolphin Tale and there are many more plot points that seem to be a stretch but this latest marine adventure is every bit as free-spirited and considerably bolder. The Inupiat boy played by newcomer Ahmaogak Sweeney for example is a stock character - an opportunist who sells overpriced cardboard to the journalists whose delicate feet cant stand up to the frozen ground. The surprise is that hes a minor character at best and no ones pushing him to steal a single scene.""Big Miracle is full of such simple acts of intelligence. And thats a minor miracle.Janice Page can be reached at jpageglobe.com. (c) Copyright 2012 Globe Newspaper Company.

Darren Michaels/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Darren Michaels/Universal Pictures Big Miracle Director Ken Kwapis Genre Drama Running Time 107 minutes Rated PG for language With John Krasinski Drew Barrymore Ted Danson Kristen Bell Watch Clips From Big Miracle - Like Us Like Us Credit Universal Pictures From Big Miracle - Listen Listen Credit Universal Pictures From Big Miracle - Hitching A Ride Hitching A Ride Credit Universal Pictures When its mammal-saving time at the movies the plot typically unfolds as a pitched battle between critter-loving gods and oil-drilling monsters. I wouldnt call Ken Kwapis impish Big Miracle a radical departure from the rule. But its at least refreshing that in this story of a struggle to save three stranded gray whales off the coast of Alaska the universe divides into greater and lesser humans every flawed one of them with a personal dog in the fight. (Oil barons are people too right? Certainly if theyre repped by Ted Danson a real-life environmentalist whos having a ball playing the enemy mostly with his eyebrows.) Loosely based on Thomas Roses 1989 book about a real-life Reagan-era drama that gripped the public fed the news cycle and brought grist to the publicity mill for both pols and fat cats Big Miracle tells the story of Barrow Alaskas struggle to free the whales from behind a thickening slab of ice that prevents them from making their annual migration to warmer climes. Drew Barrymore all grown up but still trailing E.T.s Gertie in her saucer eyes and her gift for the ill-considered blurt plays Greenpeace activist Rachel Kramer an arm-waving hothead with a self-defeating habit of ticking off the power brokers she needs on her side. Among those on her hit list are Dansons tycoon whos anxious to repair his tarnished image as an eco-killer; the National Guard (as embodied by Dermot Mulroney) which is only trying to help; and Rachels ex-boyfriend (John Krasinski) a TV reporter chasing the big story that will fast-track him out of this frozen backwater. And thats not counting the local Inuit leaders who for once escape the noble-savage treatment usually afforded them in eco-Hollywood. The tribe has a survival stake in harvesting the whales; their elder (John Pingayak) is a quick study in how to manipulate the media and his unavoidably cute grandson (Ahmaogak Sweeney) is a fan of Western pop as well as a budding tourism entrepreneur who sells cardboard warming devices to shivering townies at 40 a pop. Big Miracle doesnt have much of a plot other than the comic escalation of interested parties who descend like vultures on the tiny town hoping to convert the whales plight into all manner of capital. Given this vast human ensemble its no wonder the beasts themselves played by startlingly lifelike animatronic creatures built in New Zealand and shipped to Alaska get edged out of the action. Aside from one lovely underwater sequence shot by the great cinematographer John Bailey this carbuncled family of three mostly bobs up and down adorably in a square yard of frigid water melting stony hearts by the score. Malik (John Pingayak right) and his grandson Nathan (Ahmaogak Sweeney) each have a stake in the fate of the whales. Darren Michaels/Universal Pictures hide caption toggle caption Darren Michaels/Universal Pictures Unless you remember the Cold War youll never guess who saves the day. Big Miracle is a family movie fitted with the usual appeals to multiple audiences and though tots teens and younger parents might find the action a little slow until the rescue pressure builds the grandparents will enjoy it as a trip down media memory lane complete with cut-in footage of an astonishingly young-looking Tom Brokaw Dan Rather and Peter Jennings. The back of Reagans head has a brief cameo and theres a death and a wedding that really happened. It may be stretching the truth to suggest that the whale rescue played a bit part in thawing the Cold War but some of the funniest writing (by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler) is in Russian and theres a wonderfully stately action sequence that involves a Soviet ship head-butting a giant iceberg. The longer Big Miracle goes on the more it settles for an amiable communitarianism chased down by a PG group-hug finale. But when the excitement is over everyone goes back to being very much the compromised souls they were before. And if you pay close attention to the old news clips at the end you might catch a glimpse of an emergent persona in the form of a comely fledgling television news reporter and future governor of Alaska dewy with ambition and ready to roll.

At area theaters. Some ""nice"" movies exist to sell something while others can feel like eating your vegetables .But ""Big Miracle"" thankfully isnt either. Its really just a decent based-on-fact tale (via a nonfiction book) about how a wave of goodwill helped some of Earths largest creatures escape a life-threatening bind. While that seems like a recipe for saccharine stew the genuinely sweet nature of this sometimes clunky movie is mixed with a little sass and wins you over. The animals in peril are a trio of California gray whales that got trapped in October 1988 under quickly freezing ice near Barrow Alaska a city far north of the Arctic Circle. Their desperate surfacing for air is spotted by a go-getter TV reporter (John Krasinski). The reporters Greenpeace volunteer ex-girlfriend (Drew Barrymore) and the Alaska Wildlife Foundation determine that the whales will drown if they try to reach the sea 500 miles away. The story attracts the attention of major news outlets and soon hundreds of people show up at the big carnival. An anti-Greenpeace oil mogul (Ted Danson) volunteers to help knowing itll be good PR. Same with the outgoing Reagan administration which okays an order for the Coast Guard to pull a giant rig across Alaska to aid the rescue. Even the Soviets raise an American flag on an ice-cutting ship and help. The local Inuit community which has survived on whale meat for thousands of years aids in several ways as everyone finds a means to contribute -- even while profiting too. ""Big Miracle"" sometimes feels as if it too is trapped in ice moving slowly from one thisclose idea to another. Still director Ken Kwapis keeps it buoyant even taking a cue from Billy Wilders (much darker) classic ""Ace in the Hole."" Kwapis background in family films helps. Kids 8 and up will get behind the films heroic tone while Krasinksis rubbery features and Barrymores earnest elementary acting style are assets. Supporting turns from a pitch-perfect Danson and Dermot Mulroney (as a gruff-but-soft-hearted general) also help. Kristen Bell and John Michael Higgins as cartoony broadcast newsers fare less well though James LeGros and Rob Riggle make a pair of visiting oh-yah Minnesotans fun. Great family movies ultimately need more than a blubbery ending. The big-hearted ""Big Miracle"" gives it a good effort providing just enough human nature to thaw any resistance.

The film which stars Barrymore and Ted Danson opens Feb. 3. (AP Photo/Universal Pictures Darren Michaels) Its hard to resist calling it a whale of a story. In 1988 an aspiring TV news reporter named Adam Carlson spotted a family of three whales trapped by thickening ice in the Arctic Sea near Barrow Alaska. Soon this supersized version of a cat caught in a tree was making headlines around the world. Environmentalists oil drillers and Inuit hunters debated the merits of saving the whales. And then President Ronald Reagan and the Soviets got involved.The widely televised event was recounted in a book by Tom Rose who lampooned the media frenzy. But the movie version of ""Big Miracle"" as directed by Ken Kwapis (""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"") is rounded redemptive and refreshingly free of cynicism.Adam (John Krasinski) is looking for human-interest stories to include on his demo reel when an Inuit boy leads him to a frozen bay and they notice a whales water spout. Rapid freezing has blocked a gray whale father mother and son from the migratory route that leads to the spawning site off California. Soon after a network airs Adams footage the remote village is besieged by opportunists including cutie-pie reporter Jill Jerard (Kristen Bell); Greenpeace activist Rachel Kramer (Drew Barrymore) who happens to be Adams ex-girlfriend; and publicity seeking oilman J.W. McGraw (Ted Danson).To soften his corporate image McGraw enlists National Guard helicopters to tow an ice-breaking barge to the site. Then the White House adds its endorsement to boost Vice President George Bush on the campaign trail and the Soviets send their navy to monitor the situation. Although its a lightweight heart-tugger ""Big Miracle"" distributes the reins to a full circle of interested parties who arent simply heroes or villains. Even the Inuit locals who range from traditionalists to profiteers are depicted respectfully. With such a large and likable cast the whales are a relatively small part of the movie. But the wonder of ""Big Miracle"" is that their fate can make a cold-hearted audience blubber.""Big Miracle""Three stars (out of four)  Rating PG  Run time 147  Content Some strong language Videos Watch a trailer for Big Miracle Feb 1 2012 (...)

"Big Miracle (PG) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review Big Miracle (PG) This family-oriented film about the efforts to save a group of whales stranded in the ice is better than it looks. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez | rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com2/2/2012 Editor rating 3 In last years A Dolphin Tale Ashley Judd Harry Connick Jr and Morgan Freeman saved the dolphins. Now in Big Miracle Drew Barrymore John Krasinski and Dermot Mulroney save the whales. Somewhere the manatees are thinking ""What about us?"" This disarming family film which recounts the 1988 international rescue effort to free three gray whales stranded in the ice in Alaska is warm and soft-edged in all the expected ways -- the sort of live-action picture the Walt Disney Co. used to crank out in the 1960s and 70s. But much like the book that inspired it -- Tom Roses Freeing the Whales How the Media Created the Worlds Biggest Non-Event -- the movie balances its sentimental side with a healthy dose of cynicism. Yes a wide range of people put aside their differences and pitched in to help these animals. But they all gained something from it too. Greenpeace activist Rachel (Barrymore) blackmails politicians to help the cause or else she will go public and accuse them of not caring (""Im going to tell the world Ronald Reagan killed those whales"" she shouts when the White House hesitates to lend a hand). Adam (Krasinski) is the local TV reporter in Barrow who breaks the story then uses his ensuing fame to land a job at the networks. Ted Danson plays an oil industry tycoon who offers boats and helicopters to the operation free of charge because money cant buy that kind of p.r. Vinessa Shaw is the presidential aide who strongly advises the government to get involved because Reagans second term is coming to an end and this cause would do wonders for George Bushs presidential aspirations. Even the Soviets join in because the Cold War isnt really going their way. Director Ken Kwapis is good at juggling ensemble casts (his credits include Hes Just Not That Into You and episodes of TVs The Office and Parks amp; Recreation) and he gives all the characters in Big Miracle enough screen time to make an impression albeit not always a very deep one. Mulroney is amusing as the military pilot who reluctantly agrees to join the rescue efforts even though he was hoping for a more dangerous assignment (""Are they at least killer whales?"" he asks). Ahmaogak Sweeney steals many scenes as a young Inupiat who starts a nice side business hustling all the out-of-towners for supplies. Big Miracle packs a lot into its 107 minutes including romance relationships the machinations of big business and the ruthless competition in the TV news industry. But the movies central focus are those three whales -- a father mother and baby who may not survive if their would-be rescuers arent able to somehow free them from their ice prison five miles away from the open sea. Even if you know how the story turns out Big Miracle gets to you This isnt exactly Marley amp; Me but I still was blinking back tears in one scene and the actors embody their stick-figure characters just enough to make you care about the films human protagonists too. In any other movie you would roll your eyes when Barrymore says  ""Even though theyre big and powerful theyre so much like us. Were vulnerable and we get scared and we need help sometimes too."" But here the line works because it is exactly the kind of thing her character would say. Big Miracle even throws in an unexpected bonus a surprise last-minute cameo that is funny without being the slightest bit mean just like the rest of this hugely likable movie.

"Big Miracle Review - tribunedigital-chicagotribune Sections HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs HomeNewsBusinessSportsAamp;ELifestylesOpinionReal EstateCarsJobs Big surprise Whale tale Big Miracle is a winner -- 3 starsFebruary 02 2012|Michael Phillips | Movie criticDrew Barrymore stars in ""Big Miracle.""The success of last years ""Dolphin Tale""proved this theorem Imperiled marine animals plus true-ish story plus workmanlike sincerity plus happy ending equals a hit. Will the equation hold for director Ken Kwapis whale movie""Big Miracle""?The film is surprisingly good though the ""surprisingly"" part betrays certain low-bar expectations going in. So be it. Kwapis whose recent screen work (""Hes Just Not That Into You""""The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"") carried much longer titles exceeds those expectations handily while juggling an ambitious number of characters and agendas -- and without demonizing any of them. Not the drilling-rights Big Oil magnate not the Greenpeacenik not the fur-hooded jackals of the press not the whaling Inupiat tribespeople. And certainly not the three California gray whales trapped under the ice off Barrow Alaska.This was the Chilean miners story of its day a juicy apolitical suspense drama that caught the sympathies of millions at the fluke end of the Cold War. In 1988 three grays were discovered under the ice-covered Beaufort Sea a few miles from open water. Local news turned into regional news then national then global. With the blessing of the Reagan administration the Alaska National Guard attempted one manner of ice-breaking rescue; the Soviet navy helped out in the clinch. A couple of guys from Minnesota with a homemade de-icing machine trekked up to Barrow to help out.The screenplay by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler takes what it likes from Thomas Roses nonfiction account ""Freeing the Whales How the Media Created the Worlds Greatest Non-Event"" and cooks up the rest. (Per Roses ""non-event"" subtitle whales being trapped under the ice was nothing new.) But the script is cleverly balanced and structured.The invented triangle at the center of ""Big Miracle"" features Drew Barrymore as a Greenpeace organizer and anti-drilling activist whose ex-boyfriend (John Krasinski) is a TV news reporter gathering feature fodder up in Barrow. Hes about to head back to Anchorage harboring hopes of moving to the Lower 48 when the biggest break of his career swims right up and blows icy water in his face. ""Brokaws a sucker for these stories"" says one character. Kristen Bell goes around in a fish-out-of-water snit as an LA on-air personality working the story; theres also a blatant and not entirely successful bid to provide the film with a native Alaskan preteen (Ahmaogak Sweeney) as the demographically appealing narrator.Much of ""Big Miracle"" feels calculated but Kwapis his writers and the ensemble achieve a considerable amount within the calculation. For one thing theres film newcomer John Pingayak a charismatic natural as the leader of the Inupiat whale hunters. For another there are the whales and the way Kwapis and his designers chose to depict their plight.One should never expect the whole or even the partial truth in any film based on a true story. This one tells some of it; more valuably ""Big Miracle"" tells its sort-of-true version of events in a democratic and humane fashion by way of a rangy lively group of competing interests who actually do on occasion act like real people. The supporting cast is rich enough to include both Tim Blake Nelson (as a wildlife official) and for a minute or two Kathy Baker (as the wife of an oilman played as a crafty glad-hander by Ted Danson). Kwapis shot ""Big Miracle"" in and around Anchorage and even with a fair bit of green-screen fakery the film doesnt look and feel as if made on laptops in California. Also theres no attempt to humanize or goo-goo-eyes the whales themselves.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Based on a true account of international attempts to free a family of whales trapped in Alaskan ice in 1988 Big Miracle might look like a hopelessly bland Animal Planet-ready family film in the Dolphin Tale mode but under its crowd-pleasing exterior lies an undercurrent of bracing cynicism. Nearly all of the characters are motivated by a combination of pragmatism ambition and self-interest. For ambitious reporters John Krasinski and Kristen Bell the whale tale is their ticket up the professional food chain. For oil magnate Ted Danson joining forces with the free-the-whales brigade serves as an opportunity to score good publicity for a much-maligned corporation. The Reagan administration meanwhile joins the unlikely alliance to free the whales out of a desire to redeem its atrocious environmental record as Reagan prepares to hand over the reins to George H.W. Bush. People generally do the right thing in Big Miracle but not for the purest reasons. Krasinski who worked extensively with director Ken Kwapis on The Office stars as a hungry young newshound who stumbles upon the story of a lifetime when he finds three whales trapped in a thick potentially deadly wall of ice that blocks their path to open water. When Tom Brokaw uses Krasinskis report to fill out the nightly national news a sleepy local story becomes a big complicated international development especially once the Soviets and a Greenpeace activist played by Drew Barrymore enter the fray. Of all the players angling for advantage Barrymores tree-hugger is the one most motivated by idealism. Its a testament to the films surprising welcome ambiguity that shes also easily its most insufferable character a strident humorless scold given to sermonizing. Kwapis fills small roles with great character actors like Stephen Root Andrew Daly Kathy Baker Tim Blake Nelson John Michael Higgins Rob Riggle and James LeGros all skilled at making a lot out of a little. Big Miracle isnt quite an Arctic Ace In The Hole--Billy Wilders pitch-black morality tale about the journalistic circus that ensues when a man becomes trapped in a cave--but it echoes Wilders misanthropic classic enough to be far better and far more adult than it really has any right to be.

While rooting for the marine mammals (and wishing for more footage of them--and even of their animatronic incarnations) your heart will also go out to the cast stuck even more pitiably in syrupy manufactured crises.In October 1988 Adam (John Krasinski) a TV reporter from Anchorage doing some stories in tiny Barrow accidentally captures a whale spout on camera; he and his young Inupiat sidekick Nathan (Ahmaogak Sweeney) and the boys grandfather Malik (John Pingayak) a tribal elder statesman discover a trio of whales blocked from swimming south to Mexico by five miles of ice in the Beaufort Sea. Adams segment on the creatures plight is picked up by NBC Nightly News (""Brokaw loves these stories""). As the other major networks follow suit rescuing the whales becomes an excellent PR opportunity for Greenpeace activist Rachel (Drew Barrymore) big-oil executive J.W. McGraw (Ted Danson) an Alaska National Guard colonel (Dermot Mulroney) a staffer for Ronald Reagan (Vinessa Shaw)--and for the glasnost-era Soviet Union.Directed by Ken Kwapis (Hes Just Not That Into You) from a screenplay by Jack Amiel and Michael Begler Big Miracle like all animals-in-peril movies leans heavily on anthropomorphizing the underwater giants. ""Everybody loves whales"" Adam says. (His observation was the original title of the film which is based on Tom Roses 1989 book Freeing the Whales How the Media Created the Worlds Greatest Non-Event.) If so that affection mutates into narcissistic personality disorder in Kwapiss movie as Rachel Adams ex cries to him ""Even though theyre big and powerful theyre so much like us. Were vulnerable and we get scared and we need help sometimes too.""Barrymore is frequently called upon to deliver sanctimonious rants followed by tears and Krasinski to soothe her by reminding her of her limits. Adams caretaking is complicated by the arrival of Jill (Kristen Bell) an ambitious TV reporter from Los Angeles and the only character who articulates in a sentence or two the cynicism laid out in the title of Roses book. But Big Miracle isnt a vehicle for barbed commentary on the news cycle (though two of the biggest front-page disasters that would later grip Alaska the Exxon Valdez oil spill and Sarah Palin are referenced lightheartedly in the closing minutes). Almost as central to the movie as Barrymores sobs is its obsession with pre-iEverything gadgets Cassettes and Walkmans are shot and referenced repeatedly technological relics that vie with the whales for our tenderest feelings.
