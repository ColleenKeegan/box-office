He plays Isaac Greenberg a lawyer husband and soon-to-be father who spends Christmas Eve with his two best friends--Chris (Anthony Mackie) a pro football player and Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a failing musician--in search of a famous clandestine party that has been their decade-long obsession. Isaacs wife Betsy (Jillian Bell) sends him off with a special present (a compact cornucopia of drugs) that gives rise to a wild range of outlandish visions and adventures. Each man has his trouble--Ethan tries to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend Diana (Lizzy Caplan) and Chris tries to score marijuana for his teams quarterback (Aaron Hill) while savoring his fame with a new fan (Ilana Glazer). The movies sketch-like set pieces blend erotic whimsy and pop-culture voracity; the cleverly deployed supporting cast including Mindy Kaling Miley Cyrus Michael Shannon and Tracy Morgan serves a stiff Zeitgeist cocktail. But the best and biggest gags involve stoners and boners Jewish Catskills-style shtick and Christian festivities.

Photo Credit Sony Pictures / Sarah Shatz advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW THE NIGHT BEFORE (R)PLOT Three friends continue their pre-Christmas tradition of wild partying.CAST Seth Rogen Joseph Gordon-Levitt Anthony MackieLENGTH 141PLAYING AT Area theatersBOTTOM LINE A lazy and not very funny stoner comedy.(language drug use sexuality) Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? In 2011 Joseph Gordon-Levitt played a young man with cancer and Seth Rogen was his sympathetic pal in Jonathan Levines ""50/50."" The title referred to the heros odds of survival but it also described the movies even split between stoner comedy and tender drama. A surprisingly sincere bromance ""50/50"" succeeded because it was based on a true story (by Rogens friend Will Reiser) and because it wore its heart unabashedly on its sleeve. The two actors and their director are back with ""The Night Before"" whose comedy-to-drama ratio is more like 90/10. The story which is mostly a series of drug-related jokes doesnt feel true and the movies heart is on display in a rather obligatory way. ""The Night Before"" unlike ""50/50"" offers only the occasional laugh and never strikes a genuine chord. Gordon-Levitt plays Ethan whose parents were killed by a drunk driver while he was in college. Ethans best buddies Isaac (Rogen) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) decide to cheer him up on Christmas Eve by taking him out for a night of alcohol-fueled debauchery. A little insensitive you say? Nobody objects and so begins a yearly tradition. Adulthood arrives for Isaac now a lawyer with a baby on the way (Jillian Bell plays his wife Betsy) and for Chris now a professional basketball player but not for Ethan who is still chasing the dream of attending a mythically hedonistic blowout called the Nutcracka Ball. When Ethan finally snags three tickets Isaac and Chris halfheartedly agree to go. This thin plot (by Levine and three co-writers) isnt helped by adding several thin subplots Isaac takes too many drugs Chris wants to impress a famous teammate Ethan pines for an ex-girlfriend (Lizzy Caplan). Ilana Glazer plays Rebecca a prankster who exists solely to annoy Chris (and us) while Mindy Kaling is wasted as a non-character named Sarah. advertisement | advertise on newsday Michael Shannon scores a few laughs by applying his trademark intensity to the role of a weed-toking mystic named Mr. Green but even here the tone of magical whimsy seems stolen from other movies (particularly the ""Harold and Kumar"" series). ""The Night Before"" might seem less cynical if we hadnt seen how sincere these filmmakers could be.

The Night Before which follows three friends (Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie) as they wind down a tradition of Christmas Eve guys-night-outing is of those movies where the most random scene turns out to be the whole point of things. In this case its a showdown between the elfin Gordon-Levitt and a couple of pissed (and pissing) Santas out on a Christmas Eve pub crawl. Hes outraged at what he thinks is a broffensive desecration of a childhood icon but the two are actually proper adults with a firm grasp on reality fantasy and the virtues of each. Our guys have a long journey ahead of them full of callbacks to their beloved Christmas stories the Grinch Home Alone and most importantly Scrooge. (Michael Shannon very nearly steals the show.)

Barry Hertz The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 20 2015 1200AM EST Last updated Friday Nov. 20 2015 819AM EST Comments Print /License AA Directed by Jonathan Levine Written by Jonathan Levine Kyle Hunter Ariel Shaffir and Evan Goldberg Starring Seth Rogen Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie Genre comedy Country USA Language English With its gallons of booze David Mamet levels of profanity and enough pot to kill all eight of Santas reindeer The Night Before clearly aims to lodge itself into the well-established adult holiday comedy genre. You know the one its that comfy corner of the market where filmmakers freely mix vulgarity with sentimentality vices with Vixen (see A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas Bad Santa Friday After Next etc.). In that regard director Jonathan Levines new comedy succeeds handily The film is a near-perfect mesh of raunch and that-time-of-the-year sincerity - a warm hug with your drunk uncle. But The Night Before also accomplishes something far more interesting in the background something that star and producer Seth Rogen has been working on for his entire career using film as a playground for comedy-ringer all-stars. Like The Interview Neighbours and This Is the End (all co-produced with creative partner Evan Goldberg) Rogens latest project is an exercise in testing the limits of how many truly funny people he can cram onto one screen.The plot is simple just like the three bros it centres on Three lifelong friends (played by Rogen Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie) endure one wild Christmas Eve in New York as they hunt for the ultimate holiday party. Along the way they run into exes rivals criminals celebrities and other quirky complications that have been plaguing Manhattanites ever since Griffin Dunne went to Soho in Martin Scorseses After Hours.As with the best comedies the narrative beats dont really matter. All you need to know is that every false move results in a hilarious set piece that can stand aside such (non-seasonal) classics as Caddyshack The Jerk and Anchorman. An encounter with a drug dealer offers each of our heroes a glimpse into their neuroses-addled futures. A cocaine binge for Rogens character turns the teddy bear of an actor into a sweaty cock-eyed ogre along the lines of Shrek. And a limo ride from hell ensures no one will ever drink Red Bull again.The list goes on and would be longer if I could recall every line drowned out by the chorus of laughter and tears at my press screening. But any comedy with enough test-audience torquing can score big easy laughs - I mean we all enjoyed at least bits of The Hangover didnt we? (Well I did. Not ashamed.) The Night Before though takes things a step further by flooding the zone with friends-of-Rogen talent - this is a film for which the phrase ""hey its that guy"" was invented.From the leads down to the walk-on roles every part is filled out by either an established member of the comedy industry or a rising up-and-comer worthy of immediate attention. That means larger stars such as Rogen Mindy Kaling and Tracy Morgan but also performers plucked from small-screen semi-obscurity (Workaholics Jillian Bell Nathan for Yous Nathan Fielder Broad Citys Ilana Glazer). Even Drunk Santa 2 - the guy with maybe three lines - is played by one of the funniest if little known men on basic cable (The Leagues Jason Mantzoukas).The result is a finely tuned comedy machine a film that not only works as a standalone contemporary project but one that will come to be viewed in five 10 15 years as a snapshot of industry players at their prime and a handy guide to before-they-were-famous icons. For a comedy nerd its 100 minutes of pure joy.Rogen isnt doing anything necessarily new - hes just adapting the lessons of his own mentor Judd Apatow who pioneered the ringer-cast concept with his TV projects Freaks amp; Geeks and Undeclared which were populated by known quantities (Joe Flaherty Ben Stiller) and on-the-cusp comic actors who are now ubiquitous (Rogen Jason Segel Amy Poehler Kevin Hart). Think of Rogens work as an act of paying it forward Now that hes a marquee star he can bring everyone he admires big or small along for the ride. (Its also a different model than the epic comedies of the sixties when films such as Its a Mad Mad Mad Mad World overstuffed their casts with established and often fading performers to compensate for more obvious weaknesses.)Not everything works here. The three BFFs can seem ill-suited to one another and the script keeps flirting with moments of absurdity when it should simply double down and commit. Still The Night Before deserves to become an annual tradition - a film to both celebrate the season and to see just what became of the guy who played Coat Check Patron.

A few aging man-children get together run wild with drugs booze and sex and somehow learn some deep lessons about themselves in the process. ""The Night Before"" has enough genuinely funny bits to elevate it above just another turn of the bromantic comedy crank but its only truly distinguishing factor is that its ostensibly a Christmas movie.The film finds buddies Isaac (Seth Rogen) Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) taking a final run at their long-standing tradition of Christmas Eve debauchery. Isaac has a baby on the way. Chris is a big-shot athlete. Ethan has never really gotten his act together. But the three thirtysomethings agree its time to send their arrested development out in style by attending a mysterious Christmas mega-bash called the Nutcracker Ball.Cue running wild deep lessons et cetera. The three leads gel well enough although Rogen is the only one who leaves a lasting impression creatively portraying Isaacs near-constant high as he cycles through using just about every drug known to man.Its the supporting players who really shine here. As Ethans ex Lizzy Caplan conjures a smoldering chemistry with Gordon-Levitt. And the great Michael Shannon steals every scene hes in as the trios former teacher/pot dealer.The movie goes on and off the rails mostly off for a lot of late third-act business including one celebrity cameo of increasingly cringe-inducing length. But the problem isnt consistency so much as how pat it all feels. When we were first introduced to Rogen in ""Knocked Up"" there was some novelty to a story about a dopey slacker who learns some family values. But ""The Night Before"" is just dutifully following a template. Except its at Christmas this time.Patrick Dunn is an Ann Arbor-based freelance writerThe Night BeforeGRADE C+Rated R for drug use and language throughout some strong sexual content and graphic nudityRunning time 101 minutes 9 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story http//detne.ws/1jave4P MORE STORIES",http://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/2015/11/19/movie-review-tom-long-breezy-night/76085474/,200,thenightbefore4,thenightbefore,detroitnews
"Review"" The Night Before adds a little something extra to Christmas movies and midnight Masses - LA Times MOVIES ENTERTAINMENT MOVIES Review The Night Before adds a little something extra to Christmas movies and midnight Masses The Night Before Sarah Shatz / AP Seth Rogen left and Michael Shannon in ""The Night Before."" Seth Rogen left and Michael Shannon in ""The Night Before.""  (Sarah Shatz / AP) Rebecca KeeganContact Reporter Apparently some people really do experience the holidays as a joyous twinkly lighted Kohls ad. How wonderful for them.For the rest of us a curly haired Jewish boy has arrived to remind us of the reason for the season. Im talking of course about Seth Rogen who stars in and produces ""The Night Before"" a raucous and refreshing new take on the Christmas movie. SIGN UP for the free Indie Focus movies newsletter gt;gt;This drug-fueled buddy comedy is definitively not a family film -- though ""The Night Before"" is a movie about the families we choose. Underpinned by a sweet tone it earns its R rating with brio as a sprawling cast of comic all-stars cavort in New York City on Christmas Eve en route to a mythic party called the Nutcracka Ball. It is worth noting this time of year as we heap praise on dramatic actors that comedy is hard and take-no-prisoners performances take many forms. ""The Night Before"" is full of impressively committed comic acting led by Rogen who is surely the Laurence Olivier of playing stoned. See the most-read stories in Entertainment this hour gt;gt;Read the story The movie reunites Rogen with his ""50/50"" director Jonathan Levine and co-star Joseph Gordon-Levitt while adding a new face Anthony Mackie to a story about three childhood friends who have convened each Christmas since one of them suffered a tragedy. Their believable screen chemistry reflects the uneasy spirit of friends who are holding a relationship together just as they are starting to outgrow it.Drugs lend an aura of magical realism to a straightforward screenplay by Levine Kyle Hunter Ariel Shaffir and Rogens producing partner Evan Goldberg. With set pieces showcasing New York at its holiday season loveliest including Rockefeller Center and an FAO Schwarz-inspired toy store Levine sets up a visual contrast to the misadventures of his delightfully weird characters.Clad in gaudy holiday sweaters the cast members are all working their own best angles. Rogen spends most of the film high as Isaac a man convinced he must serve as his pregnant wifes emotional rock. From a cocaine-fueled diatribe of anxiety in a bar bathroom to a midnight Mass meltdown wearing a blue Hanukkah sweater he somehow manages to convey vulnerability while behaving like a lunatic. It is Rogens particular gift to seem decent while puking in church. Gordon-Levitt sings and plays heartbroken with a charming sense of self-awareness as Ethan a wounded guy who has reasons for keeping love at a distance while Mackie flashes his winning gap-toothed smile as Chris a pro athlete obsessed with his social media profile.Levines most inspired bit of casting is Michael Shannon. Best known for his dramatic work as intense menacing characters in ""Boardwalk Empire"" and ""Revolutionary Road"" Shannon reveals a droll side here as an emotionally overinvested weed dealer who is this movies version of Clarence the Angel from ""Its a Wonderful Life.""The films actresses are equally gifted their roles as co-conspirators in the nights events a welcome departure from the scoldy wives or boobs-with-lines tropes that plague so many other male-driven comedies. Jillian Bell is Isaacs lovably goofy pregnant wife Lizzy Caplan is the girl who got away from Ethan ""Broad Citys"" Ilana Glazer is a horny Grinch and Mindy Kaling a relatable everywoman out for a good time on Christmas Eve.With nods to holiday films like ""Home Alone"" ""Die Hard"" and ""Its a Wonderful Life"" ""The Night Before"" knows exactly what it is -- a movie to watch every year with friends a plate of leftovers on your lap your mood enhanced by tryptophan or ... something.rebecca.keeganlatimes.com------------The Night BeforeMPAA rating Rated R for drug use and language throughout some strong sexual content and graphic nudityRunning time 1 hour 41 minutesPlaying In wide release Privacy Policy Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times A version of this article appeared in print on November 20 2015 in the Entertainment section of the Los Angeles Times with the headline ""Christmas plus coke make for a new classic - A drug-fueled Seth Rogen and crew have a haphazard and hazardous holiday in `The Night Before. - REVIEW"" -- Todays paperTodays paper | Subscribe Entertainment Reviews Movies Seth Rogen Joseph Gordon-Levitt Christmas Michael Shannon Indie stalwart James Schamus makes his directorial debut with Indignation Looking for the human moments beneath the TV filters of the Democratic and Republican conventions Back stories and mannerisms help Tatiana Maslany keep her many characters clearly defined Most PopularLocalSportsPoliticsEntertainmentOrange CountyOpinionPlace An Ad84deg",http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-night-before-review-20151120-story.html,200,thenightbefore5,thenightbefore,latimes

Entertainment Seth Rogens New Movie Avoids A Raunchy Comedy Cliche The Night Before is wildly uneven but its poignant about what being a grown-up can mean for friendship. Alison Willmore BuzzFeed News Film Critic View this image > Seth Rogen and Jillian Bell in The Night Before. Sarah Shatz / Columbia Pictures ID 7370723 Its a nice sly touch that Seth Rogens pregnant wife is the one who provides the drugs that fuel the out-past-dawn adventures of The Night Before.Her name is Betsy (played by Jillian Bell the scene-stealing surly roommate in 22 Jump Street) and she doesnt come along on the Yuletide boys night out that Isaac (Rogen) has spent with his besties Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) ever since the death of Ethans parents 14 years prior. She doesnt seem to know all that much about illicit substances. But she gives her husband more than her blessing on the evening of debauchery She gifts him with a box containing ""every single drug in the whole world"" (obtained from Craigslist) and sends him off to have fun and keep his friends company on a vulnerable holiday one last time before the baby comes. View this image > Joseph Gordon-Levitt in The Night Before. Sarah Shatz / Columbia Pictures ID 7370731 No lectures no evasive tactics and hes the one who insists hell probably be home early (Spoiler alert He does not). The annual outing is coming to an end not because someone else is calling time on the hard partying but because the guys themselves are after nearly 15 years of doing this. They have lives of their own now or at least two of them do and staying out all night loses a lot of its luster in your mid-thirties. Also hey its Christmas -- a night that if you celebrate it (and Isaac is Jewish but married to a gentile) is traditionally more about cozying up with loved ones than tearing it up in New York City.Men-behaving-badly comedies like The Night Before have been slowly thankfully extricating themselves from the pattern of wives and girlfriends being treated as the finger-wagging end to everything fun whether the intent is fond (as in Judd Apatows pre-Trainwreck work) or disdainful (as in Todd Phillipss). Rogens Neighbors screen partner Rose Byrne even had a Kevin James-citing meta moment in which she scolded his character for assuming shed always be the adult in their relationship -- ""Its offensive that I have to be the smart one all the time. Im allowed to be just as irresponsible as you"" View this image > Anthony Mackie in The Night Before. Sarah Shatz / Columbia Pictures ID 7370741 The Night Before -- which Jonathan Levine directed and wrote with Kyle Hunter Ariel Shaffir and Evan Goldberg -- is a raucous comedy with a sweet soul thats tremendously uneven wrestling to strike a balance between jokes and drama and to bridge the slack spots between some uproarious cameos and Rogens (hilariously) sweaty blitzed-on-everything antics. But theres a mournful poignance to its depiction of long-term friendship that comes from how its tensions about maturity have been internalized. Rather than deal with some external representative of time passing the three have to contend with the ways in which their lives are taking them in different directions and that their friendship may indeed last forever but it cant remain as is.Its an idea that twinges the heart more than any of the movies planned pathos which includes the recently-single Ethans habit of using his parents accident to keep commitments at arms length; Chriss sudden steroid-enabled pro-football fame; and Isaacs fears about his impending fatherhood. The Night Before doesnt develop any of these enough for them to land with impact (and Mackies feels particularly undercooked throughout). But none of that matters when the movie is really rollicking Isaac is contemplating his heteroflexibility while trading dick pics with a stranger Ilana Glazer shows up as whats basically an evil version of her Broad City character and Michael Shannon steals the show as an intensely deadpan potentially magical drug dealer. View this image > Gordon-Levitt Rogen and Mackie in The Night Before. Sarah Shatz / Columbia Pictures ID 7370751 But it does sap the movie of momentum at the end when everyone goes off to get a bow tied on their individual plot thread and to grow as people. Levine last paired Rogen and Gordon-Levitt in the cancer dramedy 50/50 a funny-sad tribute to a friendship weathering the most stressful of circumstances. The Night Before picks up in sentiment years after its characters have made their grand gestures of devotion and loyalty when their bonds are facing a different sort of test -- time. Its a test the movie flinches in the face of though its understandable that it opts for the nicer images of everyone together than the harsher truth that no matter their history three adults with little in common are a lot more likely to drift apart.After all hey its Christmas.

By Cary Darlingcdarlingdfw.comPosted 1109am on Saturday Nov. 21 2015 Saturday Nov. 21 2015 Saturday Nov. 21 2015 By Cary Darling Fort Worth Star-Telegram First the good news Seth Rogen is growing up. Then the bad news Seth Rogen is growing up.With Neighbors and now the Christmas-themed The Night Before the comic actors juvenile goofball persona has morphed into a family man wrestling with issues of commitment and parenthood while still wanting to hang on to his youth.Its a natural evolution from Superbad and Pineapple Express but comes with a cost. The Night Before is a mixed Santas bag of gags with only a few truly laugh-out-loud moments. But the project has enough of a good-natured yuletide spirit about it that its hard not to be charmed.Isaac (Rogen) Chris (Anthony Mackie) and Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are three lifelong New York friends who have a holiday tradition of donning their gaudy Christmas sweaters and going out to party on Christmas Eve even though Isaac is Jewish.It started as brotherly therapy for Ethan who lost his parents in a car accident many Christmas seasons ago. Now its ritual.This year its extra special because its the last time they will be able to do it. Isaacs wife Betsy (Jillian Bell) is pregnant and Chris career as a football player is starting to take off. So they want to go out with a bang and with the hard-to-get tickets to a renowned but underground Christmas party purloined by Ethan they put their plan in motion.As could be predicted nothing goes right in large part because Betsy gave Isaac his present -- a box of drugs -- early. She figures if this is going to be his last hurrah before fully settling down shed allow him this one last extravagance.The three leads have good chemistry together and their easy camaraderie helps carry the movie over the laugh-free spots. But as directed by Jonathan Levine ( Warm Bodies and the far superior Rogen/Gordon-Levitt film 50/50) The Night Before only occassionally lives up to its comic promise. By the end it tries to skate by on its long list of cameos which range from Mindy Kaling to Miley Cyrus. The best by far is from Michael Shannon as a wise dope dealer.As far as crass crude holiday movies go The Night Before cant hold a Christmas candle to A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas. But the Rogen of today probably is fine with that. Tweet We welcome your comments on this story but please be civil.

The new movie is profane insane politically incorrect religiously irreverent and ridiculously funny. Jonathan Levines crude comedy also opens too early for my taste as its jingles out Friday when Christmas is still weeks away. Just dont go looking for moral inspiration for the coming holidays. Even though there are some mushball scenes at the end that is not what Jonathan Levines movie is up to for most of its 101 minutes of sex sass insult and injury. As for the vintage Its a Wonderful Life -- my personal favourite on the all-time Christmas movie list -- the three friends at the heart of The Night Before are all having lousy lives for various reasons. That is what makes them interesting especially because each is played by a name actor who conjures some holiday jollies and emotional jolts. Ethan (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt with a hangdog air of melancholy) is a pathetic loser who has never recovered from the sudden death of his parents 14 years earlier. He also publicly pines for his ex-girlfriend (Lizzy Caplan). Chris (played by Anthony Mackie at full-throttle funny) is a late-blooming football star who secretly got good by taking steroids. His doting mom (Lorraine Toussaint) would not approve. Isaac (played by Seth Rogen in a deliciously twisted variation of his stoner dude persona) is a former hippy-dippy druggie who now has to settle down. That is because his wife (Jillian Bell) is pregnant with their first child and Isaac is secretly freakin out. Armed and dangerous with their angst their secrets their lies and Isaacs box of designer drugs the three life-long pals set out on what they have decided will be their last Christmas Eve party night. Ever since those double deaths 14 years earlier the boys have gotten into hijinks that have become rituals and perhaps even rites-of-passage from boy to manhood. The dark comic tone is a little like what Martin Scorsese created in After Hours 30 years ago although that is a better film and not holiday related. Among the New York City stunts in The Night Before are sessions at a karaoke bar a Tom Hanksian turn on the foot piano from Big and a visit to the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Plaza in the middle of Manhattan. This being an extreme Christmas flick and with the stars obviously being willing to do almost anything co-writer and director Levine wants them to do The Night Before quickly careens off the rails. Transgressions are plenty. They include seeing Rogens Isaac wearing a Star of David ""Christmas"" sweater while puking his guts out at midnight mass in a cathedral where he rails loudly against the charge that Jews killed Jesus. That scene alone tells you that The Night Before has no compunction about being offensive to anyone who is uptight about the true significance of Christmas. The movie is incredibly uneven going wildly from camp to crass to crazy to sloppy to sentimental. Along that trippy trip Levine introduces Michael Shannon as a pot dealer who has a direct connection to God (like Clarence Odbody in Its a Wonderful Life) and Mindy Kaling who has a direct connection to James Francos penis. In addition to cheeky frame grabs of his member Francos cameo also involves a bisexual fantasy seduction of Rogen. Make of it what you will. Meanwhile squirrel-cheeked Miley Cyrus shows up as herself as the onstage entertainment for a legendary Xmas Eve party. Will holiday wonders ever cease?

Jonathan Levine (The Wackness) wrote the original story for this yuletide diversion which has been punched up to little effect by a crew that includes Rogens perennial writing and producing partner Evan Goldberg. Its one of those comedies in which the big jokes bomb but the small apparently improvised character moments generate a few chuckles; the richest running gag involves Michael Shannon as an irascible pot dealer who sees himself as a modern-day Jay Gatsby.

"The Night Before hits comic high note review | Toronto Star SectionsSearch the print archivesSectionsEntertainmentMoviesThe Night Before hits comic high note review Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie play three lifelong buddies on a Christmas Eve last hurrah in The Night Before.Seth Rogen Anthony Mackie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt star in The Night Before.  (Courtesy Sony/Columbia Pictures)  By Linda BarnardStaff ReporterThu. Nov. 19 2015The Night BeforeStarring Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen Anthony Mackie Lizzy Caplan Jillian Bell Mindy Kaling and Michael Shannon. Directed by Jonathan Levine. 101 minutes. Opening Friday at major theatres. 18AArticle Continued BelowAmid the comic antics surrounding Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie as buddies on a manic drug-soaked Christmas Eve The Night Before also gives heartstrings a tug as longtime best friends get their halls decked one last time before making way for adult responsibilities.The years are catching up with Isaac (a scene-stealing Rogen) now a lawyer with a pregnant (and endlessly patient) wife Betsy (Jillian Bell). Chris (Mackie) is a pro football star getting too famous to hang with guys from his youth. And sort-of musician Ethan (Gordon-Levitt) is slowly realizing theres something missing in his life pining for the ex-girlfriend (Lizzy Caplan) he just wasnt ready to commit to.Since Ethan lost his parents in a car crash 14 years before the three guys have spent Dec. 24 together as narrator Tracy Morgan explains in an amusing Clement Clarke Moore-inspired verse that sets the comic tone.Their annual rituals never vary cheesy theme sweaters Chinese food and Run-D.M.C. karaoke. This year thanks to Betsy Isaac also has a sampler box of illegal substances. One of Chriss sponsors provides a limo and Ethan comes up with the best goody of all three tickets to the epic secret party they have always dreamed of attending the Nutcracka Ball. Writer-director Jonathan Levine (50/50) teams again with Rogen and Gordon-Levitt but this comedy owes as much to Pineapple Express and This Is The End (penned by Rogen and Evan Goldberg who contributes here as well) with gross-outs sharing screen time with warm sentiments.Multiple side plots prompt cameos that work (and one that doesnt) often leading back to Michael Shannon as a laid-back philosopher/weed dealer who comes with a nod to David Johansens Ghost of Christmas Past cabbie from Scrooged.Mindy Kaling is fun as Isaacs co-worker whose lurid selfies from ""James"" are strangely tempting to the very stoned Isaac. Broad Citys Ilana Glazer plays a pushy Grinch who does all she can to undermine Chris dropping a Home Alone sight gag that adds to a growing pile of asides and pop culture references. Occasionally suffering from poor focus and bits that go on too long like the joke that builds throughout several scenes and finally hits its punch line with a letdown The Night Before strives to remind us what matters most isnt how you spend the holidays but who youre with.

His two best friends Isaac (Seth Rogen) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) have an annual tradition of going out on Christmas Eve to support their friend. (  / Columbia Pictures) There are plenty of ways to get into the holiday spirit hanging decorations lighting candles caroling. Some people even enjoy elbowing through crowds in search of gifts. The three 30-somethings at the center of ""The Night Before"" have their own tradition. Its just less . . . traditional. Every Christmas Eve childhood buds Ethan Chris and Isaac (Joseph Gordon-Levitt Anthony Mackie and Seth Rogen) don ugly sweaters get drunk hit a karaoke bar smoke a few joints and play Nintendo. As with any movie starring Rogen theres a vein of sweetness running through the predictably raunchy story of boys behaving badly (but not too badly). In this case the trios annual get-together began 14 years ago just after Ethans parents were killed in a car crash. Despondent and alone at the holidays Ethan was rescued by his longtime friends who took their buddy out drinking. Ever since theyve repeated the ritual. But even man-children have to grow up eventually. This year Isaacs wife Betsy (Jillian Bell) is days away from giving birth to the couples first child. And Chris a charismatic pro football star has little time given his celebrity on and off the field. For his part Ethan an aimless failed musician who recently broke up with his girlfriend Diana (Lizzy Caplan) would happily continue the tradition ad infinitum. But the friends agree that after one final blowout theyll suspend the custom. And what a finale it will be. Seth Rogen left Anthony Mackie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt play old friends with a holiday tradition Wearing ugly sweaters getting drunk singing karaoke and playing video games every Christmas Eve. (Sarah Shatz/Sony Pictures Entertainment) For starters Ethan has stolen tickets to the Nutcracka Ball the holy grail of holiday parties which the guys have been trying to crash for years. Meanwhile Betsy surprises Isaac with an early present a grab bag of drugs she bought off Craigslist so that her husband can enjoy one final night not to remember before fatherhood. That outlandish twist is one of many indications that ""The Night Before"" was written and directed by men. (Make that dudes Director Jonathan Levine wrote the screenplay with Evan Goldberg Kyle Hunter and Ariel Shaffir. All have worked with Rogen before.) Although Rogen and Gordon-Levitt have previously played best friends (""50/50"") the camaraderie among the three feels forced. In an apparent effort to inoculate the film against that criticism the screenplay includes a discussion about how strange it is that a tie-dyed Bob Marley fan a jock and an artsy outsider ever wound up as friends. Its especially odd as their stories diverge The more mushrooms and cocaine Isaac ingests the more worried he is about being a good father; Chris keeps getting his stash of marijuana stolen by a crazed fan (Ilana Glazer of ""Broad City""); and Ethan desperately wants to win back Diana. All of this is punctuated with plenty of gross-out humor. In one very funny scene Isaac picks up the wrong cellphone; in his stupor he cant understand why someone keeps texting him photos of penises. Rogen -- the most naturally gifted comic of the three -- nearly steals the show. But then Michael Shannon turns up playing a creepily philosophical drug dealer -- a sort of pot-smoking Ghost of Christmas Past Present and Future all rolled into one. Shannons scenes are especially funny compared with the rest of the derivative jokes which include countless references to such past holiday movies as ""Home Alone"" and ""Die Hard."" ""The Night Before"" is hardly a Christmas miracle but its good for a laugh or two. And thats not a bad way to get into the holiday spirit. R. At area theaters.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet As funny and heartfelt as Seth Rogen was on Freaks And Geeks and Undeclared even fans of those shows might be surprised by the degree to which hes become a comedy factory unto himself. Though he spent time as part of the Judd Apatow repertory company Rogen has branched out into his own writing and directing often with his buddy Evan Goldberg to the point where he can feel like the primary auteur on his films even when hes not technically the credited filmmaker or even the most central character. For example Rogen did not write or direct The Night Before his new Christmas comedy. Director Jonathan Levine brought into the Rogen fold via 50/50 receives a story credit and a co-writing credit alongside a stable of Rogen-affiliated scribes (including Goldberg but not Rogen himself). The Night Before is also a 50/50 reunion of Levine Rogen and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. And as with most Rogen movies its about friendship and growing up; as the star gets older hes been finding new ways to come of age every four or five years. Here Rogens Isaac is arguably the most mature bro in a trio of longtime best friends; hes married to Betsy (Jillian Bell) and theyre expecting their first baby. Chris (Anthony Mackie) is a newly successful late-career football player which leaves Ethan (Gordon-Levitt) as the arrested adolescent. Ethan doesnt hold a real job--hes first seen dressed as an elf for a Christmas catering gig--and seems to live for his friends annual Christmas Eve get-together a friends-as-family tradition forged in the wake of his parents death years ago. But adulthood continues to encroach and the movie finds the guys embarking on their final big night out with the goal of attending a long-rumored but never-glimpsed secret holiday blowout. In a lot of ways then this is a more grown-up Superbad; the buddies are more confident the responsibilities are more concrete the party is more elaborate and (perhaps incongruously) the drugs are more dangerous. This puts Levine who started off in the indie world with movies like the long-shelved horror picture All The Boys Love Mandy Lane and the stoner coming-of-age dramedy The Wackness in the position to differentiate the film from perhaps the best Rogen/Goldberg-written movie along with plenty of others since then. Style-wise he does--for better and for worse. He uses bleary blown-out white-light accents to give the movies New York setting touches of dreamy grit perfect for capturing the lived-in feeling of taking a break for some N64 GoldenEye at a friends moms house. But he also indulges an unfounded antsiness especially in the first half by cutting around conversations restlessly sometimes across the 180-degree line thats supposed to keep character positioning clear. The movie settles down but some of the early scenes made the unobtrusive Apatow style look even better by comparison.Of course a movie like this depends on its characters and laughs more than its directorial touches and Gordon-Levitt Rogen and Mackie all share an easy chemistry. For the most part The Night Before does a fine job of dropping into these relationships without an excess of exposition (save some awkward trailer-ready scene-setting from Gordon-Levitt). If anything some of their individual problems could stand a little more attention; maybe additional details were elbowed out by the four credited screenwriters. Still the trios closeness (or sometimes former closeness) comes through. Their annual Christmas ritual consists largely of impromptu pop-song performances which might sound tedious but is charming enough to almost wish for a musical version of the movie--particularly during their toy-store Kanye West cover and a plot turn that hinges on Miley Cyrus ""Wrecking Ball.""The Night Before isnt Rogens funniest movie. Minute for minute it doesnt have as many laughs as Superbad Neighbors or This Is The End among others. But it does contain one of Rogens funniest performances as Isaac navigates a very long and very bad drug trip a responsibility-free Christmas gift from his wife. At one point he records an addled rant into his cell phone thats both hilarious and in its way raw with nervous emotion. That emotional component is supposed to belong more to Gordon-Levitt and hes affecting as a drifting thirtysomething. But as in 50/50 the actor sometimes segregates the pathos a little too firmly from his sense of humor. If Gordon-Levitt is still left wanting for a perfect comic vehicle The Night Before also employs a deep bench of female comic talent that includes Bell Mindy Kaling Ilana Glazer and a slightly underused Lizzy Caplan.None of them get a part as meaty as Rose Byrnes in Neighbors but they all get laughs--and perhaps more importantly none of them play a killjoy nag. In fact The Night Before doesnt have any villains even of the caricatured bro-comedy variety. Betsy is a funny supportive wife even when shes annoyed with Isaac; Chris semi-feared mother is a little overbearing but warm. Even a couple of drunkards dressed as Santa Claus resist easy stereotyping When Ethan dismisses them as frat boys they angrily supply their actual grown-up professions. Levine Rogen and company manage to convey holiday sweetness and sadness without resorting to quasi-cynical posturing about what a pain the season is. Not many of the movies jokes linger after the credits roll but its inclusive warmth does.

"The Night Before review Seth Rogen and friends behaving badly - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies The Night Before review Seth Rogen and friends behaving badly The Night Before (Clip) Clip Sleigh Ride (ScreenPlay) Clip Sleigh Ride (ScreenPlay) Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune Familiar a little lazy -- and pretty funny ""The Night Before."" Last year around the holidays the world received the dubious gift of the Seth Rogen/James Franco comedy ""The Interview"" which pretended to kill off the leader of North Korea. The film led to an apparent retaliatory Sony Pictures hack costing the studio 35 million; a lot of controversial correspondence and information going public; and if anyone remembers it a pretty disappointing movie.This year comedywise ... an improvement at least. There are several funny things in ""The Night Before"" Sonys latest Rogen joint. Its sort of astonishing that Rogen -- undervalued always because he makes various forms and modes of comedy look so easy -- can still wring laughs out of a character stoned/coked/shroomed out of his gourd pretending to be under control even as hes sweating up a storm and mugging like the lost Ritz Brother. For contrast get a load of Michael Shannon. In ""The Night Before"" the protean actor plays the protagonists dope dealer and unlikely guardian angel. Shannon gently steals the movie out from under the top-billed stars who include Rogen as imminent father Isaac; Joseph Gordon-Levitt as lovelorn Ethan; and Anthony Mackie as steroidal football player and mamas boy Chris reuniting for the final round of their annual debauched Christmas Eve get-together. Proffering marijuana that leads to ""surprisingly accurate visions of the future"" Shannons character allows him to exploit a mellower than usual facet of his screen personality. There is in fact an in-joke at work when Mr. Green speaks of his ""quiet intensity"" and its unsettling effect on people.Director and co-writer Jonathan Levine who wrote ""The Night Before"" with Kyle Hunter Ariel Shaffir and Evan Goldberg arranges the comic picaresque as a sort of Manhattan vision quest a rite of passage for three boy-men taking comfort in their old rituals. Ethan orphaned as a young adult needs the rituals -- the karaoke the Chinese meal -- in ways the more settled Isaac and Chris do not. Ethans messed up over the one who got away played by Lizzy Caplan (""Masters of Sex"") who exists in story terms to be available when Ethan is ready to commit. The guys make their way through a night of adventures en route to an elusive exclusive party known as the Nutcracka Ball where Miley Cyrus and James Franco cameos share the universe with a few tender moments -- artificial sweeteners in a raunchy R-rated comedy. Levine directed the affecting comedy-drama ""50/50"" and he knows how to slam one of these party contraptions together. But theres a weird visual approach at work in ""The Night Before."" Levine and cinematographer Brandon Trost shoot most of it in unnerving close-ups with high-keyed lighting and a bright palette but a suffocating sense of space. It doesnt do the ensemble rhythm any favors; the editing by Zene Baker is jittery in the extreme and instead of complementing the storys momentum and atmosphere of danger the cutting impedes on the fun.

Jillian Bell is the wife who gives Seth Rogen drugs for his night out with the boys in ""The Night Before."" Photo Sarah Shatz Associated Press Night of the living stoners provides plenty of laughs 1 / 2 Back to Gallery There cant be a better job in Hollywood right now than being a Method actor in a Seth Rogen drug comedy. ""The Night Before"" was clearly even more fun to make than it is to watch. As many booze- and hallucinogen-filled adventures as the characters are having in the film one gets the impression that there was three times as much smoking and carousing and crashing of limousines when the cameras were turned off. But theres still plenty of laughs left over for the audience and the aggressive randomness of the script fuels some genuinely inventive comic moments. Although the writers of this R-rated cinematic binge frequently lose their focus they never lose their sense of humor. ""The Night Before"" is hung with care on the barest of plots involving Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who was orphaned as a young man during the holidays and is wrapping up his tradition of spending Christmas Eve with pro football player Chris (Anthony Mackie) and lawyer Isaac (Seth Rogen). Chris and Isaac seem incapable of cutting their own meat at the dinner table much less rising to the top of challenging fields. As much as you root for the characters to have a good time in this film you wont want any of them to procreate. But even if theyre not especially likable as individuals as a group Ethan Chris and Isaac are very sweet. This is well established during a montage set to ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" as read by Tracy Morgan where the guys give each other an early iPod (""That (expletive) holds like 100 songs at a time"") and karaoke with flawless choreography to Run-DMC. Rogens longtime collaborator Evan Goldberg seems to be the driving force among four credited screenwriters who wisely choose a good gag over realism at nearly every turn. This film is closer to the Goldberg-penned ""This Is the End"" than ""Superbad""; filled with apparent hallucinations and over-the-top celebrity cameos even before the mushrooms take hold. Michael Shannon is particularly excellent as ""Mr. Green"" an aging pot dealer whose intensity is a bad mix for the trios growing paranoia. While the adventures are dude-focused the women are given a refreshing amount to do in smaller roles. Jillian Bell is an asset as Isaacs pregnant wife offering him drugs that she bought on Craigslist as a blessing and later begging him to run the other way when he stumbles upon her family at church. Mindy Kaling proves once again that she can hold her own in any comic situation and Lorraine Toussaint plays against her normally ultra-serious casting as Chris mom. ""The Night Before"" grooves along nicely until the end when viewers are asked to take the protagonists a little more seriously. Theyve smoked and snorted and puked themselves into a corner but as hard as weve been laughing at this trio after an hour and a half theres little reason to care very much about their personal journeys. But the makers of this funny movie have jokes about that as well. Beyond all the pop culture references dumb behavior and the easily distracted ""Christmas Carol"" plotline the movie doesnt offer much to get audiences invested. You will only notice this deficiency when youre not laughing. One final note ""The Night Before"" is one more argument in favor of marijuana legalization so movie critics can finally be on the same foot as audiences in these stoner comedies. Based on the enthusiastic reaction by the guy next to me who sneaked in a Chipotle burrito bowl during the screening you should add another full star to my rating if you plan to smoke weed.

Only Gordon-Levitts character who is stuck in a rut of lonely aimlessness is not ready to essentially grow up. They obsess and stress and mawkishly muse about the situation endlessly throughout the picture. Endless also are scenes of Rogens character zapped on mind-altering substances hallucinating extravagantly and melting down frantically. One is left with the distinct impression that the picture was made for people in a similarly fried frame of mind. Self-indulgent? Definitely. Funny? Occasionally. Worst Christmas movie ever? Possibly. Soren Andersen 206-464-2358 or sandersenseattletimes.com Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights delivered weekday mornings.

Theyre best friends with a long-standing Christmas Eve tradition--see the Rockefeller Center tree Play the FAO Schwartz piano just like Tom Hanks in Big Go crazy at a basement-karaoke dive--in New York City. But this year everythings changing Isaac is about to become a dad; pro football player Chris is busy living the brand-sponsored dream (Red Bull gives you wiiiiings); and orphaned aimless Ethan is mostly busy pretending they havent both left him behind. So like grizzled bank robbers in a heist movie they decide to go all-in for one last job. It helps that Ethan has ""borrowed"" tickets for the Nutcracka Ball an invitation-only holiday blowout theyve been trying to bluff their way into for more than a decade. And that Isaacs saintly wife (Workaholics always-awesome Jillian Bell) has given them a Caligula gift bag of top-shelf narcotics--""I just went on Craigslist and put in NYC drugs""--for the final send-off. What follows is a silly stoned Turducken of a movie stuffed with scattershot bro jokes and stacked with so many cameos (Mindy Kaling Miley Cyrus Tracy Jordan Lizzy Caplan Ilana Glazer James Francos penis) that theres hardly room for the main stars to do more than race from scene to scene in a blur of reindeer sweaters wacky slapstick and weed smoke.  (The hydroponic comes from a drawling Lebowski-esque dealer played by Michael Shannon in the films best and weirdest role). The Night Before isnt really comparable at all to director Jonathan Levines last pair-up with Rogen and Gordon-Levitt the thoughtful 2011 cancer dramedy 50/50. Still in its own druggy dick-pic way its also a pretty endearing tribute to male friendship--hammy and crude and more baked than a fruitcake but with a sweetly squishy holiday heart at its center.

But thats all going to change as theyre entering adulthood. VPCSeth Rogen Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie play three friends who get together for one last traditional Christmas Eve blowout. It tries to be funny and sentimental with varying results.Seth Rogen Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie get wild on Christmas Eve in ""The Night Before.""(Photo Columbia Pictures)Story HighlightsWatching Seth Rogen do stupid things while stoned is funny at least for a whileWatching Joseph Gordon-Levitt mope is not as entertaining and gets at the problem of unevennessCritics rating 2.5 stars out of 5An ironclad rule of comedy whether its a movie television show or stand-up act If its funny enough people will forgive almost anything.But it has to be really funny. With that as a guide movies like ""Bad Santa"" and even ""A Very Harold amp; Kumar 3D Christmas"" prove the holiday season is an enormously rich source of fodder for raunchy comedy.Jonathan Levines comedy ""The Night Before"" takes aim at similar targets but hits them less consistently (well less consistently than the dark classic ""Bad Santa"" anyway).Yes watching Seth Rogen play a stoned guy doing ridiculous things is funny at least for a while -- and that is not faint praise; thats a tougher gig to pull off than it sounds. But watching Joseph Gordon-Levitt mope is not. The latter is meant to offer some depth to the film which is admirable enough. But if youre going that route the comedy and drama both have to work as they did in ""50/50"" Levines terrific film that also starred Gordon-Levitt and Rogen. In ""The Night Before"" sometimes they do sometimes they dont.AZCENTRALThe Night Before (2015) | Phoenix Arizona Movie Theater Showtimes ReviewsThe film is built around a different kind of holiday tradition. Ever since the year his parents were killed in a car accident just before Christmas Ethan (Gordon-Levitt) and his friends Isaac (Rogen) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) go out on the town on Christmas Eve the town being New York City. It has been a mix of booze drugs and more traditional holiday fare like checking out the tree at Rockefeller Center and singing ""Christmas in Hollis"" at a karaoke bar.But times have changed. Isaac is a successful lawyer and his wife Betsy (Jillian Bell) is pregnant. Chris a professional football player has surprisingly started playing like a star at an age when most players are thinking about retirement. Only Ethan is stalled a struggling musician who barely even struggles and is at present bemoaning the loss of his girlfriend Diana (Lizzy Caplan) because of his commitment issues.So heres the plan One last blowout for the three of them. And when Ethan finds er steals tickets to the legendary underground Nutcracka Ball theyve been trying to find for years expectations skyrocket.So does Isaac after his pregnant wife gives him an early present a box of every drug she could find. Um right. A heavily pregnant wife gives her husband a box of drugs and says go have fun. Oh well as they say in the movie its a Christmas miracle. No less likely than flying reindeer I suppose.Isaac (Seth Rogen) plays a successful lawyer and his wife Betsy (Jillian Bell) is very pregnant in The Night Before. (Photo Columbia Pictures)The bulk of the movie involves the three looking for the party but in the way of such things also looking for a better version of themselves. Ethan has the most obvious room for improvement but Isaac and Chris have some issues buried below the surface too.There are running jokes about Isaac being Jewish at Christmas (his ugly sweater boasts a Star of David) and Chris constant sponsor-fueled social-media presence. Michael Shannon shows up as Mr. Green a drug dealer from the guys past (and present and future thanks to his potent marijuana) who is a kind of druggie guardian angel. One of the best lines in the movie is when he says he knows that his quiet intensity can make some people uncomfortable -- it describes every character Shannon has ever played. Cameos pop up here and there some funnier than others.Which is the track record for the whole film really. Its spotty and especially toward the end surprisingly sentimental. Syrupy even. You can have raunchy humor and real heart too -- see the Rogen-Evan Goldberg screenplay for ""Superbad"" (Goldberg was a writer on this film too). ""The Night Before"" wants to make you laugh and cry but it doesnt give us enough opportunities to do enough of either.Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com.

Photo Columbia Pictures MOVIE REVIEW The Night Before Running time 97 minutes. Rated R (profanity sexual references nudity drug abuse). I was searching for a metaphor to capture the experience of watching ""The Night Before"" when a character fell backward into a dumpster full of garbage bags. Thanks guys In the tradition of bizarrely unfunny Christmas movies like ""Fred Claus"" and ""Four Christmases"" ""The Night Before"" proceeds like one of those cra-aa-azy nights where everyone goes out to get smashed and vowing to go nuts but nothing happens except a headache. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a guy orphaned before Christmas of 2001 whose best buds (Seth Rogen Anthony Mackie) take him out partying every Christmas Eve to cheer him up. They do drugs perform at a karaoke bar visit the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree (in a weirdly half-deserted Midtown -- was there a radioactive leak at Saks?) and generally seek out comedy that isnt there. Every so often someone vomits in church (Rogen) or has sex in a filthy restroom (Mackie) or falls down (Rogen). At all times everyone assumes that saying ""Christmas"" and any swear word in the same sentence is automatically funny and Michael Shannon tries his best to be enigmatic as a weed dealer. He figures into the least surprising plot twist since the mud fell off Rudolphs nose and it happens around the same time as the most predictable celebrity cameo you can think of. Seth Rogen and Jillian Bell.Photo Columbia Pictures Rogen who is sweaty and brain-fried throughout is especially unappealing indicating that he may be falling into a Ben Stiller-shaped trap of hoping that creatively humiliating himself will equal laughs except he forgot the creative part. (Jonathan Levine directed the movie and co-wrote it with three others including Rogens longtime writing partner Evan Goldberg.) Why would Rogens nine-months-pregnant wife set him loose on Christmas Eve and give him a box full of drugs? And why would Mackie now a star football player be so careless about his reputation or so intent on getting into a secret party the trio have heard about for years but never before been able to find? Dont professional athletes have better things to do? It seems bizarrely high-schoolish to think that attending a ""wild party"" means anything yet the three leads well into their 30s havent figured this out yet. This doesnt label them immature so much as it does boring and clueless -- as clueless about reality as the scene in which Rogen shows his wife a video of himself confessing he wants to kill their baby and she finds it hilarious. Usually you have to wait for a sequel to a successful comedy franchise to find something so sweaty so frantic so lacking in ideas As far as bro-gasmic comedies go file ""The Night Before"" next to ""The Hangover Part III.""

(Sarah Shatz) BY Allen Salkin NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday November 18 2015 400 AM Title The Night Before Film Info With Seth Rogen Joseph Gordon-Levitt Anthony Mackie Lizzy Caplan. All I want for Christmas is everyone getting really stoned. Director Jonathan Levine. (141) Rated R for sex and drugs. This is the Cheech and Chong movie about Christmas in New York you always wished for. Dudes smoke spliff after spliff (along with downing shrooms coke Red Bull liquor and various colored pills) ride around in a sick stretch limo have crazy sex in a bathroom with a wild woman sing on stage with a pop star have vision quests with the Spirit of Christmas Present in the form of a pot dealer vomit in a terribly embarrassing spot converse with statues in a Nativity manger and trade sext messages with a movie star. That was a long sentence. Let me exhale. Ahhhhh. Cough cough. I did not imbibe anything while watching ""The Night Before"" but I felt completely baked halfway through and occasionally heard myself laughing like I was sitting on a couch with Beavis and Butthead ""Heh heh. The stuffed lamb near the Baby Jesus called him Dude. Heh heh."" Gadzooks theres a lot of marijuana -- but then again thats Rogens genre now. Was this a good movie? Its enjoyable but its also trite especially the love story involving Joseph Gordon-Levitts character Ethan and his estranged girlfriend Diana (Lizzy Caplan -- lusted over by every Semitic man in America). Oh her perceptive brown eyes. Oh the fertile crescent of her nose. Some of the film was fascinating like when in a comedic way someone sort of gets crucified. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars in the drugged-up ""The Night Before"" which also stars Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie. (SARAH SHATZ) But gadzooks theres a lot of marijuana -- but then again thats Rogens genre now. Sometimes it doesnt work well. ""This is the End"" (2013) was a mess because it seemed like it was written and shot during a three-day Mary Jane bender. ""Pineapple Express"" (2008) was better because it managed to meld violent crime and wacky hijinx in a semi-coherent romp. ""The Night Before"" is not a great comedy on par with ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""A Christmas Story."" But Cheech and Chong movies (Google it kids) were not great either. They were liberating. They were weird and fun and trippy. ""The Night Before"" is like that. Go see it impaired or straight and youll feel like you went on a trip. Its likely to be a good one -- though not for everyone.

The three main characters--NYC childhood friends--all have their substances of choice. Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) a failed-to-launch musician warbles his way through ""The 12 Days of Christmas"" hoisting a Scotch at a family gathering. Chris (Anthony Mackie) a pro-football star secretly jacks up with steroids. And Isaac (Seth Rogen) about to become a dad pushes away his anxieties with the greatest Hanukkah gift of all a tiny box filled with an assortment of shrooms coke and long-expired freedoms. In a former life they established a Yuletide tradition involving dorky sweaters Chinese food and the famous FAO Schwarz piano from Big. This year will be their big final blowout and while The Night Before sometimes strains to be bad--some of the lesser gags deploy dick picks and the ever-grinning James Franco--the movie scores when it savors its fully-baked camaraderie. A 90s flashback to Ethans grief over losing his parents might be an outtake from Mysterious Skin or Levines own 50/50. It surprises you with its sincerity. And the bugged-eyed presence of Michael Shannon as an intense but oddly gentle pot dealer steers the movie back to welcome weirdness. Rogens fits of Jewish paranoia become arias ""We did not kill Jesus"" he shouts at a midnight mass after vomiting loudly. Guilt looms like a scowling mother through all the better laughs.

When you walk into a Seth Rogen film you kinda expect what youre getting. A very easy silly watch packed with drug filled humor and crass jokes. The sort of film that requires no effort whatsoever with a few surprising laugh out loud moments. Not Rogens best but still worth the watch Helpful?Yes|NoReplyShareMoreNov 18 2015Stve JFeaturedThis is another racist film where fat ugly Seth Rogen plays an explicitly Jewish character while good-looking Jewish actors (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lizzy Caplan this time) play non-Jews. As a matter of fact despite being the son of two Jewish parents Gordon-Levitt has never explicitly played his own ethnicity once in his entire 30 years of acting. Is there a problem Joey?This is the same racist trick Rogen pulls every time. He always casts himself as an explicit Jewish character opposite non-Jewish characters played by good-looking Jews (Paul Rudd James Franco Dave Franco Zac Efron Halston Sage etc.).And this new film is from the same studio S.S.ony that released last years Fury about fighting Nazis during WWII. Fury starred no less than four Jews (Logan Lerman Jon Bernthal Jason Isaacs and Shia LaBeouf) yet none of the characters were Jewish and Jews and the Holocaust were never mentioned.

This is a picture that has possibilities but it lacks follow-through before finally giving in to its own worst impulses. The premise is neatly established in a swift-moving opening montage Ethan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) loses his parents in a drunk driving accident in 2001 and for years afterward his best friends Isaac (Seth Rogen) and Chris (Anthony Mackie) have spent Christmas Eve with him drinking and carousing. During all of these years they have wanted to attend a secret party called the Nutcracker Ball but they have never been able to get an invite or even find the location. See Video Seth Rogen Squashes Beef With Justin Bieber on Ellen In the present day Chris has become a sports star with a dirty secret while Isaac is about to become a father. Ethans music career has stalled hes just lost his girlfriend Diana (Lizzie Caplan) and the best he can do for work is a humiliating job passing out hors doeuvres in an elf hat. Ethan is forced to smile and make elf faces by his harshly demanding boss and this scene is rooted in a recognizable reality. It is also pretty bleak. Isaac and Chris havent told Ethan that this year is the last time they want to do the Christmas Eve ritual with him and so the situation here has the potential for tragedy but the film soon veers off into that familiar unstructured sort of modern comedy in which the actors are expected to use scenes as opportunities for sloppy sexually crude improv. See Video Sandra Bullock Anthony Mackie Admit to Lying to Police During Never Have I Ever on Ellen Isaacs grateful pregnant wife Betsy (Jillian Bell) gives him a stash of drugs to have fun with during the night and so Rogen spends the entire movie doing variations on being stoned out of his mind while making habitual references both pointed and pointless to being Jewish. These pay off only in one fairly funny scene where a wigging-out Isaac helplessly disrupts a midnight mass attended by Betsy and her ultra-blond ultra-Catholic parents. ""The Night Before"" toggles back and forth between attempts at comedy that are fair-to-middling and a far more promising dramatic reality like a scene where the three guys play video games in Chriss old room and quietly talk about what it was like to be friends at school. As Mr. Green an intense guy who sold the guys weed during their school days Michael Shannon is funny and unsettling at first because he doesnt vary his usual dramatic performing style at all. But as Mr. Green keeps appearing Levine totally spoils the characters impact by over-explaining him and even making reference to what was so effective in Shannons first scenes ""My quiet intensity has that effect on people"" Mr. Green tells Ethan toward the end. See Video Joseph Gordon-Levitt Goes Full Janet in Lip Sync Battle Holiday Teaser This meta impulse is like a disease that kills the climax of the movie which takes place at the aforementioned Nutcracker Ball and involves highly expendable cameos from James Franco and Miley Cyrus both playing themselves and mildly spoofing their own personae in what feels like blatant product placement. Its as if the makers of ""The Night Before"" have it in them to make a touching and funny movie but instead throw that chance away by not taking what theyre doing seriously enough. (And yes the making of a comedy is a serious and exacting business if you want it to be good.) Theres a moment here when Chriss mother Mrs. Roberts (Lorraine Toussaint) gently touches her sons shoulders and says ""I love you"" right after he bails out on doing some charitable work with her the following day. The way that Toussaint says ""I love you"" and makes that light physical gesture is a powerful thing because you can feel all of Mrs. Robertss disappointment with her son as well as the love she still feels for him or has to feel for him. A first-rate movie of any genre would recognize a moment like that and build on it rather than cash in all its chips with gratuitous celebrity cameos and closing scenes that feel more like goofing off than moviemaking.

Grow Up -- Again Tuesday November 17 2015 at 7 a.m. By Alan Scherstuhl A A Facebook- Twitter - More shares recommend reddit email - - How funny really are dick pics? Millions of them must be snapped and shared each year as inducement or harassment celebration or shaming. Perhaps Harpers Index could tell us the tonnage of coal mined each year to power the transmission of American crotches. So when a dick pic turns up in a raunchy R-rated comedy the shock isnt what were beholding. The shock is the very idea that we might be shocked that the penises feel so fussed over and spliced in. Much funnier than the flash of flesh is imagining the studio meetings where studio dopes argue over how many frames we can take. Their prudishness over the surprise dicks meant to jolt some exposition in Spy threw the comedy into brief incoherence; the pics flitted primly past just a hair slower than subliminal messages. Confused viewers might have thought Tyler Durden had spiked the reel.Credit hit-and-miss holiday comedy The Night Before then for the courage of its dick-pic convictions. The first couple play as the usual wan transgression like the filmmakers believe there are still Margaret Dumonts around to gasp ""Why I never"" But for once the movie camera doesnt shy away from what our real-life cameras are down with. Seth Rogen doesnt either -- for the second time he seems to have grown past the comedy of gay panic. The Night Before stars the game-for-anything near-adult Rogen of Neighbors who was up for jolly stream-crossing watersports with Zac Efron and not the shrill sour oaf behind The Interview. His schmo here is flattered and impressed when tripping on mushrooms he gets texted a surprise junk shot. After a couple of admiring responses and a couple more dicks Rogen (lets not bother pretending his characters names matter) gets asked if hed like to handle it. Rather than blanch he beams confessing that thats not really his thing but that he did once touch another boys at camp.Film Details The Night Before RatingR GenreComedy Running Time101 min. More Info Trailer Thats all sweet a sort of one-act illustration of the tension in all Rogens comedies If his characters so relish the company of men why not go whole hog? But its not exactly funny. In fact it was only The Night Befores fifth or sixth dick that got me laughing the one where its a scenes giddy capper played like yet another gotcha celebrity cameo.That run of jokes is The Night Before in essence. (Its directed and co-written by Jonathan Levine best known for The Wackness and 50/50.) Heres a cohort of likable guys -- Anthony Mackie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt -- doing the things you expect in Rogen films hanging laughing toking rapping old songs learning life lessons already learned in other Rogen films. At first the laughs are Hangover III-spare and the picture is too shambling to lunge for them. But these leftovers warm up eventually. The usual setups at last develop variations and you might be reminded of why audiences first responded to Rogen back in Knocked Up.Here the star peaks in his go-for-broke bad-trip freakouts first in a bar bathroom where his character rages against his unborn son and then in bookending scenes of blasphemy surrounding a midnight Mass. These are funny and courageous and probably caused Sony fits Last year it was the North Koreans; this year itll be Foxs not-much-more-reasonable War on Christmas squad. Its not the drugs and the peen and the public puking thats funny -- its what you do with them.Theres a plot cribbed from Gene Kelly and Stanley Donens Its Always Fair Weather that not-quite-a-sequel to On the Town Old friends reconvene for a ritualistic New York night out in this case the latest in a series of stoned-dude Christmases but find that adult life has snuffed their youthful spark. The storys perfunctory and theres little feeling in it. For long chunks I forgot that Gordon-Levitts commitment-phobe songwriter is also the character in the Kelly role the one were supposed to be rooting for to find love here with a grinning dirty-talker played by Lizzy Caplan.Instead the film is a revue. There are four musical numbers one by a pop-star ringer. Michael Shannon turns up as a Christmas Carol-inspired drug dealer offering the joints of Christmases past present and future. Theres walk-on guest stars some playing themselves. Theres a Santa brawl a parkour foot chase some undistinguished vehicular mayhem creaky speeches about the meaning of friendship and the magic of Christmas and a Broad City/Die Hard crossover that violates the storys every pretense of believability. (That last ones not a complaint.)James Franco turns up at his most ingratiating and self-lampooning to entice Rogen and Mindy Kaling with the promise of a threesome -- and to remind us that these days Rogens feeling open-minded rather than easily skeeved. In fleeting moments Mackie and Gordon-Levitt exhibit their physical grace but the dancing and leaping isnt framed to the actors advantage. (Kelly and Donen weep) Theres so much to pack in that most of these scenes get no time to breathe and build.The exception The scenes that come just when most audiences will be aching for the credits to roll. As revues go this one is indifferently paced with all the heartfelt and dramatic stuff coming after the big ending. These predictable reconciliations are well acted and as they go on studded with unpredictable jokes recalling the richer emotions of 50/50 which starred Rogen and Gordon-Levitt. But its all too late and those moments are followed by yet another song and then a second blowout ending powered by still another celebrity cameo. Its exhausting possibly a sign of fearful neediness Boys today show you their dicks first thing and then spend forever trying to prove what nice guys they are.The Night Before Directed by Jonathan Levine Sony Pictures Opens November 20 Directed by Jonathan Levine. Written by Jonathan Levine Kyle Hunter Ariel Shaffir and Evan Goldberg. Starring Seth Rogen Joseph Gordon-Levitt Anthony Mackie Lizzy Caplan Mindy Kaling and Michael Shannon.

The movie opens in U.S. theaters on Nov. 20 2015. (Sarah Shatz/Columbia Pictures via AP) Review Stellar cast boosts stoner comedy Night Before Tuesday November 17 2015 0102 PM By SANDY COHEN AP Entertainment Writer Boosted by its stellar cast and playful take on ""A Christmas Carol"" The Night Before"" is a coming-of-age stoner-buddy comedy laced with warm holiday cheer. Make no mistake its still a silly romp thick with dope smoke and dumb jokes but the performances are solid and theres some surprising sentiment behind the wacky antics. Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie play best friends bidding farewell to their 10-year tradition of partying together on Christmas Eve. Ethan (Gordon-Levitt) is determined to make their last night epic especially since Chris (Mackie) is on a hot streak in his football career and Isaac (Rogen) is expecting a baby. Isaacs wife Betsy (the hilarious and soon-to-be everywhere Jillian Bell) gives her husband a special gift in honor of his last Christmas Eve with his pals a box filled with ""every single drug in the whole world."" Well you can imagine how things go from there. Isaac dips into the stash as soon as they leave the house. Rogen is predictably over the top as he samples each substance falling deeper and deeper into a delusional haze. This presents ample opportunity for gross-out moments like when he barfs in church or lets his nose bleed into a womans martini. Meanwhile Ethan surprises his friends with tickets to the hottest party in town the one theyve dreamed of getting into since their holiday tradition began. But first Chris needs to pick up some weed. (Somehow Betsy left that out of the box.) This sets the trio on their adventure bringing them in contact with the mysterious Mr. Green (a brilliant Michael Shannon) for the first of several meetings. He introduces Chris to ""the weed of Christmas present."" Later in the film the weed of Christmas past and future is smoked. (Poor Dickens.) Along the way the guys meet up with Ethans ex-girlfriend (Lizzy Caplan) and her friend (Mindy Kaling) Chris mom (Lorraine Toussaint) and Rebecca Grinch (Ilana Glazer). Each of these actresses appearances is a little holiday treat that helps balance the dumb-guy debauchery. Miley Cyrus James Franco and Tracy Morgan also make welcome well-played cameos. Isaac maintains a steady level of wasted-ness throughout the film as he frets about fatherhood. Rogen channels this with ease and with considerably more maturity than in 2007s ""Knocked Up.""Chris documents his every move for his social media profile but secretly feels his popularity may be coming at too high a price. With his Juilliard pedigree and dramatic gravitas Mackie has poise and charisma to spare so its oddly comic to hear him utter such lines as ""I just fame-(expletive) that hipster chick""Gordon-Levitt brings his usual charm and accessibility to Ethan who faces the hardest holiday challenge What will Christmas Eve be like without his buddies? Theyve moved on with their lives; why hasnt he?Written and directed by Jonathan Levine (""50/50"" The Wackness"") ""The Night Before"" is a millennial coming-of-age story cloaked in a cloud of smoke. Its a druggie comedy to be sure but a sweetness about vulnerability honesty friends and family cuts through the haze.Things may be tied up a little too neatly but it is Christmas after all.""The Night Before"" a Columbia Pictures release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for ""drug use and language throughout some strong sexual content and graphic nudity.""

Although in this case the friendship is heavily bromantic the most traditional carol comes from Run-D.M.C. and some of those miracles may arrive courtesy of all the illegal drugs being consumed. In other words its A Very Seth Rogen Christmas. Which is actually fine. Compared to the recent labored ""Love the Coopers"" - which tried to warm hearts with a blowtorch - ""The Night Before"" is easy to take and its mood surprisingly sweet. Its story - introduced with some deliberately bad rhymes from Tracy Morgan - centers on three friends Rogen Anthony Mackie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. For the more than 10 years since Gordon-Levitts parents were killed Rogen and Mackie have been faithfully spending Christmas Eve with him hitting the same bars and restaurants. But Rogen is married now and expecting a kid Mackie is a hot-stuff football star whos obsessed with building his social-media brand and JGL is still stuck in neutral - jobless loveless living in the past. Will this December 24th be any different? Well yes it will - courtesy of an enormous underground party and some truly transformative drugs. The screenplay - which comes from a variety of hands including Rogens longtime writing partner Evan Goldberg although not Rogen himself - has the short-attention-span feel of a lot of stoner scripts. Characters disappear. Plot threads unravel. But - as usual - Mackie works very hard Gordon-Levitt has a nicely wry sensibility and Rogen is just a big teddy bear albeit one smelling funkily of weed. And the movie has a strong supporting cast including Lizzy Caplan and Jillian Bell.Best is Michael Shannon who plays ""Mr. Green"" a mysterious drug dealer who seems to show up just when our heroes most need to alter their states. Dead-eyed and dead serious Shannon lights up every scene hes in with a wickedly humorous humorlessness. True the actors arent always well-served by the script which like too many modern comedies depends heavily on juvenile dudes judgmental women jokes about gays and James Franco (and as an dubious bonus jokes about James Franco being gay). But get past those lowest-common-denominator gags and youll find a nicely raucous occasionally rude but genuinely warmhearted holiday comedy about buddies (and buds) seasonal traditions (and sexting catastrophes) and love. You wont see it replacing ""Its a Wonderful Life"" anytime soon in a list of annual traditions. But right now it just might give you the ho-ho-hos you need. Ratings note The film contains full-frontal nudity sexual situations substance abuse strong language brief violence and James Franco. The Night Before (R) Sony (101 min.) Directed by Jonathan Levine. With Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen Anthony Mackie. Opens Friday in New Jersey.    Stephen Whitty may be reached at stephenjwhittygmail.com. Follow him on Twitter stephenwhitty.

"The Night Before Review Seth Rogen Stars in Raucous Holiday Comedy | Variety Variety Editions U.S Latino Global Asia Subscribe Today Navigation Menu Film TV Digital Contenders Video Dirt Jobs More Biz Music Legit Scene Conferences Insight Archives Directory Choose Edition U.S Latino Global Asia Russia | My Account Sign In Subscribe HomeFilmReviews Film Review The Night Before Nick Schager Film Critic nschager 22 Share This Article Email LinkedIn Pin It Tumblr Courtesy of Sony November 16 2015 | 0845PM PT Boys will be boys in this raucous Yuletide comedy starring Seth Rogen Anthony Mackie and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Seth Rogen takes the high holidays literally in ""The Night Before"" a raucous drug-fueled ode to the seasonal spirits power to help man-children mature into responsible adults. Little more than a Christmas-y spin on many of the actors prior comedies Jonathan Levines film nonetheless generates significant humor from its tale of three lifelong friends who come together on Dec. 24 for one last night of go-for-broke New York revelry -- this time with the aim of finally attending the renowned Nutcracka Ball that has for the past 14 years eluded them. Brimming with R-rated naughtiness before per formula turning far too nice its a profanely festive odyssey that should far exceed Rogens controversial 2014 year-end effort ""The Interview"" and place closer to the jolly box office territory of last summers 150 million-grossing ""Neighbors."" Reteaming with both co-star Joseph Gordon-Levitt and director Levine his collaborators on 2011s cancer dramedy ""50/50"" Rogen dons a bold white-and-blue sweater emblazoned with a giant Jewish star as Isaac a lawyer on the verge of having his first child with wife Betsy (Jillian Bell). That daunting duty doesnt at the outset seem to intimidate Isaac. Yet cracks in his calm-and-cool facade begin to materialize once he embarks on a nocturnal adventure with best friends Chris (Anthony Mackie) a football star whose sudden fame at age 34 is the product of steroids and Ethan (Gordon-Levitt) a lonely going-nowhere musician whos getting over a break-up with Diana (Lizzy Caplan) and whose parents 2001 deaths were the catalyst for the trios yearly ritual of getting smashed on the night before Christmas. Given a heavenly gift box of narcotics by Betsy Isaac hits the town alongside his buddies in Chris Red Bull limousine -- a perk of his celebrity which he nurtures via endless product-peddling social-media posts -- and immediately begins chomping on handfuls of hallucinogenic mushrooms and then tempering his trip with snorts of cocaine. Hes the out-of-control lunatic of this merry threesome and Rogens zonked-to-insanity performance is the lifeblood of ""The Night Before"" giving it the sort of joyous madcap energy that comes from letting loose with ones closest comrades even to the point of potential oblivion. As in a stellar sequence that finds Isaac trying in vain to achieve sobriety -- an effort that results in bug-eyed glares and awkward elbow-on-knee sitting positions -- Rogen is at his finest when in the throes of panicked confused paranoid substance abuse. Mackie meanwhile exudes an amusing cockiness underscored by insecurity fitting for a character doing his best to delight in attention that he knows hasnt been virtuously attained. His fan-indulging bluster meshes nicely with Rogens outsized druggie daftness as well as the aw-shucks mopiness of Gordon-Levitt here condemned to be the unfunny straight man. Ethans desperate desire to cling to this Yuletide-partying procedure stems from his fear of losing touch with his surrogate brothers just as his refusal to meet Dianas parents -- the cause of their separation -- speaks to his terror over the changes that might come from acting his age. Hes the embodiment of the storys hackneyed boys-becoming-men trajectory and though Gordon-Levitt is charming his Ethan is the buzzkill of these proceedings which only truly hum when letting loose with unbridled impropriety. Theres quite a bit of that throughout ""The Night Before"" as Ethan Isaac and Chris make their way from one cherished spot to another including Rockefeller Centers towering tree the gigantic FAO Schwarz piano made famous by ""Big"" a karaoke bar where they perform Run-DMCs ""Christmas in Hollis"" and Chris moms house where they play a round of the classic Nintendo 64 video game ""GoldenEye."" Those pit stops feature just a few of the scripts many shoutouts to 80s and 90s pop-culture artifacts which are sure to play well to Rogens (and the films) thirtysomething target audience and which come across as authentic examples of these characters inability to stop clinging to their adolescent pasts. Considering the hijinks-heavy nature of this endeavor which in subject matter and attitude recalls 2011s ""A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas"" some incidents prove less fruitful than others -- such as a strained gag involving Isaac inadvertently switching phones with Dianas friend Sarah (Mindy Kaling) and then contemplating a homosexual affair upon seeing the explicit crotch-shot pics she receives from an admirer named ""James"" (one guess as to that mystery mans real identity). Fortunately ""The Night Before"" proceeds with such go-for-broke momentum that any lulls in the action are quickly eradicated by the next wacko bit. The finest of these concern Rogens Jewish Isaac engaging in ludicrous dialogue with Christians (and their messiah) especially at a misbegotten visit to midnight mass. Equally inspired are the trios meetings with a pot dealer who provides the protagonists with ""A Christmas Carol""-by-way-of-THC visions of their past present and future and whos played by Michael Shannon as a more deadpan mellow-but-menacing version of his usually hyper-intense on-screen self. As with so many comedies about men learning to discard their hedonistic ways in order to confidently embrace roles as husbands fathers and grown-ups the film inevitably becomes a schmaltzy slog that tsk-tsks the very behavior its previously celebrated. Still a few climactic Nutcracka Ball cameos partially mitigate this devolution into dreary earnestness as does a subtle -- if insufficiently explored -- idea about the way holiday traditions bind friendships even when marriage kids and jobs threaten to unravel them. While females are merely around to help facilitate their male counterparts transformations this boys-will-be-boys saga is buoyed by its casts uninhibited enthusiasm for sex-and-weed-and-bodily-fluids madness -- as well as by a score chockablock with holiday standards and visuals awash in warm twinkling lights that cast a simultaneously vulgar heady and heartfelt seasonal spell.

Todd Holmes says November 24 2015 at 824 am I think this movie should be shown on a double-billing with Mel Gibsons Passion of the Christ. Reply Snipping Tool Download says November 20 2015 at 916 am This movie is significant in that the sweaters the guys are wearing were featured in an episode of ""Shark Tank."" TipsyElves is a goofy little company started by two goofy guys who are now multi-millionares who run a very very very large goofy ugly sweater company. All because of those sweaters you see above the review. That should inspire you. Much more so than yet...another...Seth...Rogen...and...Joseph...Gordon....Levitt...buddy...comedy. Was James Franco not available or would casting him make it too painfully obvious that Rogen has nothing new to bring to the table save for re-gifting his films to his dwindling fan base using the same co-stars and playing the same character over and over? I used to be a huge Rogen fan until ""Observe and Report."" After that....not so much. He still has potential to win me back because hes just that funny but only when he breaks away from what has now become overly familiar and offers something new. Like he did in the movie that put him on the map- ""Knocked Up."" There is one exception however- ""This Is the End."" That movie is so funny on so many levels in spite of yet again co-starring alongside James Franco that I could watch it all day repeatedly. Reply stevenkovacs says November 17 2015 at 729 pm Meh. Reply wiles11 says November 17 2015 at 134 pm Such a relief to know that Seth Rogen has included gay panic jokes in yet another movie. Its the gift that keeps on giving to Seth Rogen apparently. Reply wiles11 says November 17 2015 at 133 pm Here I rewrote the first sentence of that last paragraph for you ""As with so many Seth Rogen comedies about Seth Rogen and/or his friends learning to discard their hedonistic ways in order to confidently embrace roles as husbands fathers and grown-ups the film inevitably becomes a predictably schmaltzy Rogen-esque slog that tsk-tsks the very behavior its previously celebrated in order to make Rogen feel better about his own real life behaviour."" Youre welcome. No need to pay me. Reply Hitch says November 17 2015 at 1008 am One of the worst trailers I have ever seen. Nothing even close to funny. Vomiting in church is supposed to be funny? Fail. Reply Stanley O says November 17 2015 at 1043 am Totally agree. I saw the trailer at the Arclight where the audience hissed and booed it at the end. Looks absolutely dreadful. Reply Mr. Mike says November 17 2015 at 707 am Hollywood jews continually insulting Christians but scared to death of muslims. Reply Chuck says November 17 2015 at 709 pm Its a damn shame that Hollywood cant respect a large audience like CHRISTIANS. Do you think you would EVER see a Christian character vomit at a gay pride parade or in a synagogue? What a bunch of bigoted idiots. Hope this is a colossal fail. Reply J Jenkins says November 17 2015 at 555 am After reading this well-written article and watching the trailer my only two questions are what studio moron okayd this mess to be actually released and who are the investors stupid enough to finance this film. I am more interested in knowing who the investors are so that I can ""sell"" them a few things as they are obviously idiots with too much cash on their hands. Reply Mitchell K says November 17 2015 at 551 am Not interesting in seeing anything from the loud-mouthed ass Seth Rogen whose entire ""Fred Flintstone as a sloppy Jew"" act has grown ice cold. REALLY hoping this is a complete bomb and judging from the trailer it most certainly will be. The trailer is terrible with not a single laugh in it and those are supposed to be the ""highlights."" Even the dialogue was stupid. Going on and on about Miley Cyrus old record ""Wrecking Ball? Really? Wow. Reply CelluloidFan35mm says November 17 2015 at 428 am Man mainstream comedies have hit rock bottom. They have been getting worse and worse and you can add this POS to that list. Its insulting and embarrassing. What the hell happened to REAL comedies? Is anyone even trying anymore? Ill stay home and watch Christmas Vacation on Blu-ray. That movie is a REAL comedy. Reply wiles11 says November 17 2015 at 141 pm What happened to real comedies? Seth Rogen unfortunately. Same pig different perfume. Every time. Reply John says November 16 2015 at 851 pm This is another racist movie where schlubby Seth Rogen plays an explicitly Jewish character while good-looking Jewish actors (Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lizzy Caplan this time) play non-Jews. As a matter of fact despite being the son of two Jewish parents Gordon-Levitt has never explicitly played his own ethnicity once in his entire 30 years of acting. Is there a problem Joey? This is the same racist trick Rogen pulls every time. He always casts himself as an explicit Jewish character opposite non-Jewish characters played by good-looking Jews (Paul Rudd James Franco Dave Franco Zac Efron Halston Sage etc.). And this new film is from the same studio S.S.ony that released last years Fury about fighting Nazis during WWII. Fury starred no less than four Jews (Logan Lerman Jon Bernthal Jason Isaacs and Shia LaBeouf) yet none of the characters were Jewish and Jews and the Holocaust were never mentioned. Gee maybe they should have cast Seth Rogen as a ""funny"" Jewish soldier who died early on in the film. Actors of fully Jewish background Logan Lerman Natalie Portman Joseph Gordon-Levitt Mila Kunis Bar Refaeli James Wolk Jennifer Jason Leigh Julian Morris Adam Brody Esti Ginzburg Kat Dennings Gabriel Macht Erin Heatherton Odeya Rush Anton Yelchin Paul Rudd Scott Mechlowicz Lisa Kudrow Lizzy Caplan Emmanuelle Chriqui Gal Gadot Debra Messing Robert Kazinsky Melanie Laurent Shiri Appleby Justin Bartha Sarah Michelle Gellar Margarita Levieva Elizabeth Berkley Halston Sage Seth Gabel Corey Stoll Mia Kirshner Alden Ehrenreich Eric Balfour Jason Isaacs Jon Bernthal William Shatner Leonard Nimoy. Andrew Garfield and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are Jewish too (though I dont know if both of their parents are). Actors with Jewish mothers and non-Jewish fathers Jake Gyllenhaal Dave Franco James Franco Scarlett Johansson Daniel Day-Lewis Daniel Radcliffe Alison Brie Eva Green Joaquin Phoenix River Phoenix Emmy Rossum Rashida Jones Jennifer Connelly Sofia Black DElia Nora Arnezeder Goldie Hawn Ginnifer Goodwin Amanda Peet Eric Dane Jeremy Jordan Joel Kinnaman Ben Barnes Patricia Arquette Kyra Sedgwick Dave Annable Ryan Potter. Actors with Jewish fathers and non-Jewish mothers who themselves were either raised as Jews and/or identify as Jews Ezra Miller Gwyneth Paltrow Alexa Davalos Nat Wolff Nicola Peltz James Maslow Josh Bowman Winona Ryder Michael Douglas Ben Foster Jamie Lee Curtis Nikki Reed Zac Efron Jonathan Keltz Paul Newman. Oh and Ansel Elgorts father is Jewish though I dont know how Ansel was raised. Robert Downey Jr. and Sean Penn were also born to Jewish fathers and non-Jewish mothers. Armie Hammer and Chris Pine are part Jewish. Actors with one Jewish-born parent and one parent who converted to Judaism Dianna Agron Sara Paxton (whose father converted not her mother) Alicia Silverstone Jamie-Lynn Sigler. Reply Responder says November 17 2015 at 1045 am All the Jewish-born actors you mentioned playing non-Jews (plus Brad Pitt) in the tight ensemble drama FURY were absolutely exceptional (really an awesome cast)...and if memory serves the Holocaust angle wasnt really germane to this particular story being told. Your post is perplexing are you suggesting that actors only be cast along religious lines? If so weird. Reply stevenkovacs says November 17 2015 at 733 pm Time for Adam Sandler to again update his Hanukkah Song? Mike Guns says November 17 2015 at 742 am This is the worst verse of Adam Sandlers Hanukah song ever Reply Will says November 16 2015 at 1111 pm Thanks adolf Reply Quazar says November 17 2015 at 547 am Great post. The Jews in Hollywood thing is very real. Argos Wolf says November 16 2015 at 849 pm Cant watch anything with Seth Rogen in it. One of the most overrated ""actors"" ever. Reply StellaG says November 16 2015 at 1043 pm ^John - You have some major issues. Get some help. Reply Jude says November 16 2015 at 853 pm 100 percent agree. I watch nothing from Rogen a true one-trick pony and the pony left long ago. I pass.

TWITTER Joseph Gordon-Levitt Seth Rogen and Anthony Mackie hunt for the worlds best Christmas party in Jonathan Levines latest. A Christmas comedy whose warm and fuzzy theme doesnt get in the way of the hedonistic action fueling its laughs Jonathan Levines The Night Before reminds us that while the families we choose can be just as important as those were born with those bonds require conscious renewal in ways blood ties dont. And that shrooms and nose candy are as bad a pairing as eggnog and champagne. Seth Rogen frequently upstages co-stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie without derailing the momentum of this up-all-night pic which will have little trouble connecting with fans of outings like This is the End and Pineapple Express; meanwhile Gordon-Levitts Mr. Lonelyhearts romantic quest offers some mistletoe to female auds less drawn to such mayhem. Gordon-Levitt plays Ethan who lost his parents as a young adult and found solace in his best buds Isaac (Rogen) and Chris (Mackie). So we learn in a welcome storybook-narration intro by Tracy Morgan one of few elocutionists who could get away with rhyming ""two thousand and one"" with ""became an or-phan."" Morgan explains their tradition of spending every Christmas Eve together indulging in mischief both innocent and not while hunting for the exclusive Nutcracka Ball a secret bash held somewhere in New Yorks five boroughs. Life being life Isaac and Chris by now have reasons to discontinue this annual outing Isaac and his wife are expecting a baby; Chris recently found fame as a pro football player. But Ethan remains adrift and needy especially after breaking up with longtime girlfriend Diana (Masters of Sexs Lizzy Caplan). His string of crummy temp jobs pays off though when as a coat-check elf he discovers three tickets to the Nutcracka Ball. If the tradition is ending at least it will be with a bang. While the fellas pre-game the nights big event with all the rituals theyve established over 15 years -- karaoke the donning of atrocious holiday sweaters -- the film gets less mileage from their antics than from a string of cameos including sincere oddball Nathan Fielder as a limo driver who wants in on the action and Broad City co-creator Ilana Glazer as a libidinous and hilariously fervent disciple of the Grinch. One bi-curious drop-in will surprise nobody who follows Rogens career; another wrings laughs from the abhorrent real-life phenomenon of Santacon in which drunken louts pollute Manhattan neighborhoods one day a year in Santa costumes. But lest the film become a messy jumble of cameos pop-culture references and THC-soaked A Christmas Carol nods via Michael Shannons perfectly-cast pot dealer the shamble through Manhattan and Brooklyn draws momentum from an increasingly deranged Rogen Isaacs wife has given him a Whitmans Sampler-style array of drugs so he can enjoy this last fling and he cant help trying to counter one bad trip with another then another. Sweaty and desperate the actor is as funny as ever here destroying a Midnight Mass and exploding in I-cant-have-a-baby tirades. Mackie and Gordon-Levitt just have to keep up. As it careens from Christmas present to future to past under the deadpan guidance of Shannons Mr. Green the movie gets distracted enough by its assorted comic baubles that it fails to become a Scrooged-level incarnation of Christmas miracles. But it offers more than enough laughs to justify taking time out from TV marathons of A Christmas Story and maybe enough at least for younger audiences to become a pinch-hitter each year when established classics like Elf grow too familiar.
