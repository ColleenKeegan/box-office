That would be the Greek gods Zeus and his crew who must be enjoying the folly and folderol that is ""Immortals"" a silly would-be swords-and-sandals epic set in ancient Greece. The movie as directed by Indian-born stylemeister Tarsem Singh (""The Cell"") is full of ravishing images and makes effective use of its 3D -- lots of swords arrows blood and severed body parts coming right at you -- but its characters and story are as dull as modern day particle board. ""Immortals"" clearly hoping to attract the hordes who embraced ""300"" is full of shirtless and leather-clad muscular men military maneuvering and clanging swordplay. This one also embraces the supernatural in the form of Greek gods comely oracles and a sought-after magic bow. The movies hero is Theseus (Henry Cavill) a lowly stonemason picked by Zeus to lead his fellow mortals in the fight to defeat King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) a sadistic power-hungry ruler. Hyperion is the kind of guy who orders someones tongue cut out just for fun. Helping Theseus along the way are Phaedra (Freida Pinto) whose oracular powers enable her to   recognize his heroic potential; Stavros (Stephen Dorff) a snarky freed slave; and various Greek gods including Athena (Isabel Lucas). Those hoping for a solid grounding in the classics will be disappointed by ""Immortals."" The movie has about as much to do with actual Greek mythology as Mickey Mouse cartoons do with the study of rodents. Case in point In Greek mythology Athena was the goddess of wisdom. She was a smart cookie always in on the action and decision-making. In ""Immortals"" shes eye candy a simpering twit who would be lucky to crack three digits on her combined SATs. Cavill the British actor who will next play Superman in the 2013 reboot ""Man of Steel"" shows off a sinewy physique and requisite ability to look determined. Beyond that theres little he can do to enliven a script that seems to have been assembled simply by cobbling together snatches of screenplays from earlier films such as ""300"" ""Clash of the Titans"" ""Troy"" etc. Rourke a long way from ""The Wrestler"" here hams it up as Hyperion strutting about and purring with self-satisfied glee as he presides over yet another bloody beating or mutilation.

Some viewers may have mayhem on their minds as well after sitting through this long draggy film wearing 3-D glasses for no special reason. This is all the more dispiriting because Immortals was directed by Tarsem (aka Tarsem Singh) who built his reputation as a visualist based on innovative music videos commercials (remember the ""We Will Rock You"" spot for Pepsi?) and the almost insanely ambitious feature The Fall. Because of a second-rate script sluggish pacing and an over-reliance on CGI he is diminished to the level of his material. Yes there are some striking moments--generally involving bloody battles in which people are speared beheaded or pulverized--but there is no overarching visual concept that is worthy of the directors reputation. We might as well be watching Clash of the Titans. Henry Cavill whos built a following on the cable TV series The Tudors has the gravitas--and the muscular body--to star as Theseus an outcast in his own village because he was born a bastard. But Zeus (Luke Evans) has faith in him and fully expects him to lead his countrymen against the violent power-thirsty King Hyperion played by Mickey Rourke. Zeus warns his fellow Gods (including Kellan Lutz who doesnt get much screen time) not to interfere with the mortals below on earth but it seems they cant resist. Incidentally the vaunted virgin oracle played by Freida Pinto also manages to redefine herself before the film is over. On the face of it the story has possibilities but in Charles and Vlas Parlapanides screenplay its handled in ponderous fashion. If you like blood and guts with hand-to-hand (or should I say hand-to-spear) combat in video-game-style you may like this more than I did. As for Tarsem he hasnt necessarily lost his touch but even the most forward-thinking director still has to rely on a script and in this case that proves to be--if youll pardon the reference--his Achilles heel.

But once youve spent two hours watching amber waves of abs ripple across the screen you might think bigger credit really ought to go to the actors personal trainers. After all its the size of his pecs -- and certainly not his personality -- that designates Theseus (Henry Cavill) as this storys hero. Hes a stonemason from a small village and his single definable character trait -- a hot temper -- only serves to move him from one bicep-flexing fight to another with minimal dialogue in between. The focus of most of his anger is King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke chewing the scenery like a four-course meal) a tyrant out to conquer both the earth and Olympus by dint of a magical bow. Helping Theseus fight him are a sensual oracle (Freida Pinto) and the Olympians themselves including fiery brawny Zeus (Luke Evans) and fierier brawnier Poseidon (Kellan Lutz). The gods of Homer and Virgil these aint; Immortals shaved-chest-thumping mythology owes more to Mens Health than to Bulfinchs. Plot machinations ensue though you wont much care -- or understand since the dialogue is all muttered in a Babel of pan-U.K. accents to underscore its pointlessness. But what saves Immortals as a moviegoing experience is the exuberant kid-in-a-candy-store virtuosity of its director former music-video wunderkind Tarsem Singh (The Cell). He has no apparent love or patience for storytelling but Singh is a visualist on par with Julie Taymor and Tim Burton. He makes images of such overblown pop-baroque splendor that the eyes have no choice but to gorge. Every landscape is a canvas for cartoon-crazy architecture every body a mannequin for inhuman costumes every battle blow a candidate for slo-mo glory. Without any narrative heft these sights dont last in the mind much longer than they linger on screen. And yet they thrill in short-lived bursts that Singh doles out carefully keeping pace with the audiences appetite. Its his name that ought to be above the title.

"Immortals | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; immortals ) Immortals (United States 2011) November 12 2011 A movie review by James Berardinelli Immortals plays like the illegitimate offspring of 300 and Clash of the Titans but while it represents a substantial improvement over the latter it falls short of the former. As is typical of films directed by Tarsem Singh (The Cell) a weak narrative is overshadowed by showy visuals. Immortals uses Greek mythology as a jumping-off point but resemblances to the classic tales are fleeting. Charles amp; Vlas Parlapanides have crafted their own legend without being constrained by stories of the ""real"" Theseus or the ""real"" Olympians. The underlying premise of Immortals is that following a bloody war in which the Gods (led by Zeus) triumphed the Titans were imprisoned deep beneath Mount Taratarus. King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) has lost his faith in the goodness of the Gods (they allowed his wife and child to perish) and wants to re-ignite the battle. To do so he must obtain the Epirus Bow which has long been lost to men and immortals. He seeks out the virgin oracle Phaedra (Frieda Pinto) believing she can ""see"" its location. Before Phaedra is delivered into his hands however she gains the protection of Theseus (Henry Cavill) a warrior who seeks revenge against Hyperion for killing his mother. Accompanied by the rogue Stavros (Stephen Dorff) Theseus and Phaedra quest for the bow to prevent Hyperion for obtaining it and releasing the titans. Meanwhile Zeus (Luke Evans) and his fellow Olympians can merely look on as they are constrained by a Gods Prime Directive from acting directly to influence the lives of men. Visually with its artistic images of carnage (sometimes in slow motion) detailed settings and over-the-top instances of machismo Immortals strongly recalls 300 and one cannot imagine the synergy being anything other than intentional. Tarsem (who sometimes goes by that single moniker) has a more interesting sense of style (although he uses shadow and darkness) than Zack Snyder but he never captures the explosion of lusty bloody grandeur at the same visceral level. 300 provided a rush that Immortals strives for but never quite achieves. A rousing speech delivered by Theseus before a major battle recalls similar orations by Henry V and William Wallace but is delivered with the scenery-chewing gusto of Gerald Butlers King Leonidas. Tarsem doesnt want viewers to pay close attention to the story which is a flimsy means by which he can justify the orgy of carnage the extravaganza of epic clashes and the deconstruction of the gods and titans. The Olympians come across as all-too-human (with Zeus occasionally disguising himself as John Hurt) and the Titans look suspiciously like escapees from Peter Jacksons Mordor. Immortals is intended to be experienced on a level that doesnt require an excess of thought. To that end the hero is well-muscled and manly (one has less difficulty associating Henry Cavill with Superman after seeing this) the leading lady is gorgeous (Freida Pinto has a face the camera loves - her other body parts when exposed belong to a body double) and the villain is detestable (Mickey Rourke is deliciously evil). Trevor Morris insistent throbbing score is perfectly fitted to the films look. Immortals never ceases to radiate intensity. The same hyperstylized comic book-come-to-life approach that created an invigorating experience for viewers of 300 elevates Immortals above the level of a Clash of the Titans knock-off. The 3-D is better than what we have often seen perhaps because of the high quotient of special effects that allows it to be more easily applied. The film is as faithful to Greek mythology as Thor is to tales of the Norse Gods but it ultimately doesnt matter. Tarsems goal is to give viewers an experience a little different from the norm and to that end he succeeds. The ""wow"" factor is in full evidence and it provides a nice little burst of spectacle-tinted adrenaline at a time of year when cinema is typically more sedate.

Thats exactly how director Tarsem Singh wants an audience to receive this his latest glut of imagery. King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) has set out to conquer the Hellenic world and in doing so he makes a mortal enemy of Theseus (Henry Cavill) who then quests in the company of virgin oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) to stop Hyperion. The posters read ""From the Producers of 300"" and like Zack Snyders film Immortals has little on its mind but conveying the buzz of martial glory. Singhs specialty is the establishing Wow Shot Gods stand back and watch warring mortals from a Maxfield Parrish Olympus while Theseus fights his way across a world seemingly production-designed by French master Jean-Leon Gerome all in 3-D. Singh also has a knack for genuine eroticism briefly displayed. The neo-classicist visuals are matched to PlayStation action choreography that tops Snyders; this is among the most extravagantly violent movies in memory including Hyperions gloomy arbitrary sadism and Helios fighting for Theseus and the mortals pulping heads like Gallagher in a melon patch. Given something as simple as Theseuss rousing prebattle speech maximalist Singh is helpless but when he gets whole armies in on the act youve got something to behold Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Nick Pinkerton Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Comments (10) click to enlarge Immortals Video Rated R  110 minutes  2011 Indian director Tarsem Singh found an ideal format for his surreal imagery with The Fall (2006) which was framed by the sweet story of a little girl being told a fantastic tale by an injured movie stuntman as they recuperate in a Los Angeles hospital. Theres nothing sweet about Singhs follow-up feature a grisly 300 knockoff starring Henry Cavill as the Greek warrior Theseus and Mickey Rourke as the wicked King Hyperion. The movie is studded with memorable tableaux--a cubelike prison with miserable slaves held in check by horizontal rods a giant head wrapped in white bandages and lit from within by candles the minotaur as a human badass wearing a bull-shaped mask of nails--but this never rises above the level of a plodding sword-and-sandal adventure peopled with chiseled young beauties (Freida Pinto Luke Evans Joseph Morgan) and old pros phoning it in (Rourke Stephen Dorff John Hurt). Singh is a talented and eccentric visual artist with no creative future in the movie business. By J.R.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet In Tarsem Singhs Greek-myth-derived Immortals the gods are golden people in glowing golden robes and armor. The evil Titans they imprisoned in the earth long ago are scaly grey wearing dim grey clothes. Peasants dress in yellows and browns priestesses in vivid bloody reds torturers in complicated woven black leather. Color is characterization in Immortals which is handy since otherwise the characterization--like the acting the story beats and most other aspects of the film--is as broad and nuance-free as a long stretch of desert highway. Tarsem doesnt do subtle; as with his previous films The Cell and The Fall he mostly does staggeringly rich tableaux with muted but intense emotions to match. But in Immortals the vision doesnt feel like his own. Billed more as ""from the producers of 300"" than as ""a film by Tarsem"" Immortals meshes 300s beefcake-and-blood aesthetic with the short-lived resurgence of mythic content that brought Percy Jackson amp; The Olympians and Clash Of The Titans in 2010. Like 300 its relentlessly synthetic full of Zack Snyders signature slow-down-speed-up action welters of consciously fakey CGI gore and bulging pecs as far as the eye can see. And like 300 it talks up the human element while being utterly uninterested in humanity. Theres a plot An angry grieving king (Mickey Rourke whos genuinely intimidating particularly in his seeming amusement at all the nonsense around him) sets out to bring down the gods by finding a magical bow and releasing the Titans while peasant hero Theseus (Henry Cavill) sets out to stop him. But story is a low-rated consideration well below the films textures and colors. Curiously though those textures and colors often dont have Tarsems usual verve. Cavill in particular looks like he was cast and costumed out of a 60s swords-and-sandals epic; he wouldnt look remotely out of place fighting a Ray Harryhausen skeleton. The 3-D tends to separate into planes with rounded characters in front and flat complicated backdrops in back giving much of the film the look of an old 3-D View-Master reel. The elaborately costumed characters often look terrific in their ridiculously complicated headgear and torso-baring getups but the shiny digital world around them never looks as warm and organic. Like The Fall and The Cell Immortals mostly proceeds at an operatically slow pace (to match its operatically high pitch) so audiences have time to appreciate how its world looks. But that pacing also gives them time to think through the films flaws from its plodding script to its complete lack of depth. As mythic spectacles go it beats Clash Of The Titans particularly in the areas of intimidating villainy and actual Titan-clashing. Nonetheless it isnt any smarter than its inspirations just prettier.

Rick Groen The Globe and Mail Published Friday Nov. 11 2011 1200AM EST Last updated Monday Sep. 10 2012 240PM EDT Comments AA Country USA Language English Immortals is a breezy rewrite of Greek mythology. The names are old but the plot is new and the movie from the same producers who amassed 300 motors along like the solid commercial vehicle it is. Solid yet hardly sensational no luxury sedan but a good compact - fairly efficient in its operation typically clean in look and guaranteed to reach its destination with a minimum of fuss. Thrills are in short supply but so are annoyances. This is a maintenance-free ride. Screen grab from the online trailer for the film ""Immortals"" starring Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke Movies Immortals The official trailer Cast member Freida Pinto poses at the world premiere of ""Immortals"" at Nokia theatre in Los Angeles November 7 2011. Mario Anzuoni/Reuters video Video Immortals stars discuss buff bodies Thats a bit of a surprise coming from director Tarsem Singh who in The Cell built a reputation as a flashy stylist. Here hes almost restrained and since restraint is hardly the watchword in these Olympian epics it makes for a welcome change. Thats all the more impressive given that Mickey Rourke is in the cast as the principal baddie. Of course no one can wrangle Rourke completely but give Singh his due - he does manage to tether him a tad. Mickey his right cheek branded like a prize steer turns up as Hyperion a ferocious king leading his army on a rampage across Greece in search of the WMD of its day a magic bow whose explosive powers will allow him ""to unleash the titans and end the reign of gods."" As arrowed weapons go its mechanical logic is a little fuzzy but theres no missing the point. Meanwhile in a small village photogenically perched atop a steep cliff muscular young Theseus (Henry Cavill) is doing his best to stay neutral in these proceedings. But apparently when ones beloved mommy gets her throat slit by Hyperion himself neutrality is no longer an option. Luckily Theseus has been tutored in the martial arts by a god-in-disguise and (since its not the liberal arts) his education is about to pay big dividends. Banished to the salt mines Theseus meets a quartet of Virgin Oracles who tall and thin and entirely draped in muslin topped by colourful headgear bear an uncanny resemblance to standing lamps with ornate shades. All are virgins but only one is the real oracular deal. That would be Phaedra (Freida Pinto) offering dark visions of the plot turns to come. Pretty soon she and Theseus are on the lam together. Not much later the former courtesy of the latter is enjoying ""the touch of human flesh"" putting a smile on her face but somewhat truncating her Virgin Oracle status. From there as always matters turn bellicose. Way up on Mount Olympus a quorum of callow-looking gods are much like us watching the ensuing mayhem with a modicum of interest. Zeus is a strict non-interventionist hewing to the dangerous belief that ""we must allow humans to use their own free will."" So liberated the mortals get down to their usual business of gruesomely doing each other in. Singh has the blood spurting in lyrical slo-mo lays on the CGI to credible effect darkens the frames like a wannabe Caravaggio and most important keeps the action relatively uncluttered - his killing fields dont suffer from overkill. Barely noticeable the 3-D looks like an afterthought and indeed it is - the extra D was tacked on in post-production. Happily since the gods get off their thrones long enough to join the fray the ultimate battle unfolds rather impressively on three fronts at once. You got the divines the semi-divines and the hoi polloi fighting for turf that stretches from the bowels of Olympus right to the tippy-top. As for that magic bow the thing lights up and sparkles like a cheap Vegas prop. Sorry but after all the fuss it comes as an anti-climax - then again searches for WMDs often do.

Find out whats happening in the world as it unfolds.Actor Henry Cavill joins other stars in the new film ""Immortals.""Story highlightsThe film stars Henry Cavill who will also be the ""Man of Steel"" John Hurt and Luke Evans share the role of Zeus king of the godsThe movie offers the usual special effects but reviewer says its ""visually blah""Greece may be in an economic mess these days but the ancient gods are back in vogue at least in Hollywood where the success of ""300"" and ""Percy Jackson"" novelist Rick Riordan has not gone unnoticed. Combine that with todays computer-generated visuals which allow you to conjure up armies of extras at the press of a button and ""Immortals"" virtually writes itself. (In fact the dour humorless screenplay is credited to Charley and Vias Parlapanides.)Less ""300 2"" than ""300 3D"" ""Immortals"" is a sledgehammer action spectacle interspersed with bouts of enervating pseudo-philosophical discourse and moments of fine visual embellishment. Rising star Henry Cavill (""The Tudors"" and Zack Snyders ""Man of Steel"") is Theseus a Hellenic commoner who never knew his father but who has found a kindly mentor in a wise old man who schools him in sword fighting ethics and such.What Theseus doesnt know is that the old guy (played by John Hurt on Earth and Luke Evans when mortal eyes arent peeking) is actually Zeus the king of the gods who has been grooming the lad to lead the Hellenics against the onslaught of the blood-thirsty Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). If Hyperion gets his mitts on the Bow of Epirus (archerys answer to a ballistic missile) hell free the Titans and all hell will break loose.Why doesnt Zeus intervene directly? Apparently thats against the divine rules though the Olympians arent above bending them whenever Hyperion seems on the verge of a decisive blow. Wearing scrummy gold outfits that wouldnt look out of place in a Vegas toga party the gods are the Hellenics pinch-hitters supreme.Director Tarsem Singh (""The Fall"" ""The Cell"") is a fabulist; more than anything he wants his images to shine. And they do in places. A vision of celestials locked in permanent heavenly combat -- inspired by the Sistine Chapel -- is simply breathtaking. (Its virtually the last thing we see in the movie but before you shout ""spoiler"" its also the poster image.) The costume and design are often out of this world.And yet the movies landscape is a disappointingly barren digital domain the same gray cliffs deserts and seas familiar from ""300"" and so many game-worlds. Its not just that this is visually blah (though it is) its also as inherently artificial and airless as any studio movie of the 1930s or 40s. When Singhs camera catches a sun-flare at morning or dusk its supposed to imbue the shot with a sense of reality. But because that sunbeam is patently just another digital effect it actually accomplishes the opposite it falsifies the actors environment and reminds us this isnt really happening. (I counted the trick three times.) To my eyes the 3D only makes the movie look phonier; the actors often seem to exist in a different visual plane to their surroundings. They might as well be performing in front of cardboard flats.Still in Rourke Cavill Evans Stephen Dorff (as Theseus sidekick Stavros) and Frieda Pinto (as the so-called ""Virgin Oracle"") Tarsem has cast actors strong or pretty enough to hold us through the movies turgid breast-beating grisly violence and numbskull plotting. There arent many flicks that Mickey Rourke cant perk up and here hes adorned in the full enchilada even more scars than nature intended a shimmering silver face mask and a bonnet that seems to have been modeled on a Venus flytrap. Another (this is a heck of a mad-hatters movie) has horns like a lobster claw -- or a jackass. In short the plumage is eye-catching but the meat doesnt have much flavor. The stuff of legend it aint.Powered by LivefyreHomeU.S.Crime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaEuropeMiddle East2016 ElectionWashingtonNationWorldMarketsTechMediaPersonal FinanceLuxuryOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthDiet + FitnessLiving WellParenting + FamilyEntertainmentCelebrity WatchTV + WebMovies + MusicTechGadgetsCyber SecurityInnovation NationFashionDesignArchitectureAutosLuxuryTravelBest of TravelSleeps + EatsBusiness TravelAviation + BeyondPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerLivingFoodRelationshipsReligionVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZMore...PhotosLongformInvestigationsiReportCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersU.S. EditionSet edition preferenceU.S.InternationalConfirmU.S.InternationalArabicEspanol(c) 2016 Cable News Network.

Even while wowed by the work of Ray Harryhausen in bringing creatures of lore to life on film it was the quarrelsome interactions between Heaven and Earth that kept me from fully embracing the destinies of classic heroes. Immortals doesnt deviate from that fabulist tradition and thats fine. If anything the setting of 1228 B.C. Greece seeks to lend an air of doubt as some began to treat gods as relics of the past. Naturally they do exist and have warred imprisoning their challengers -- the Titans -- deep within Mount Tartaros and swearing by Zeus (Luke Evans) to never interfere with the ways of man. To punish them for not saving his wife and daughter from death King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke croaky as ever) has decided to wage a brutal campaign against his fellow man in order to find the Epirus Bow a mythical weapon that could set the Titans loose once more. Hyperion dares the gods to stop him and as if welcoming the challenge he dares peasant Theseus (Henry Cavill) to stop him as well by killing his mother before his very eyes. What the king doesnt know is that Theseus has been well-trained by Zeus in disguise (as John Hurt) to become the avenger that mankind will someday need. So along with oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) thief Stavros (Stephen Dorff) and well The Monk (Greg Bryk) he sets out to find the Bow before Hyperion can wield it against man and God alike. The question is how does this differ from any other big-budget swords-and-sandals picture of late namely 300 and last years remake of Clash of the Titans? Answer it has director Tarsem Singh in its corner and he applies the same sumptuous style that he brought to The Fall The Cell music videos and commercials. Hyperions soldiers are adorned in increasingly garish feats of head gear culminating in one gents bull-shaped barb-wire helmet. Tarsem even finds an excuse to coat entire scenes in black oil instead of body oil for a change and the result is like watching a latter-day Bond credits sequence for two minutes because why not. All the while Trevor Morris score is aptly bombastic heavy on horns drums and choral lament. The audio-visual flair is enough to offset the frequency with which characters pose -- with ripped men often shirtless and lovely ladies draped in fabric that wont quit -- when theyre not posturing about faith and destiny and all that Ancient Greece/Joseph Campbell jazz. Superman-to-be Cavill sure wields a mighty spear both in battle and in the bedroom yet hes a hero in the Sam Worthington tradition handsome clearly invested in the role but without the gravitas to fully embody a legend albeit in an age when nobody really worships these types of heroes anymore. Perhaps its futile although that didnt stop Gerard Butler from putting his stamp on the role all the same; thankfully shared producers or not this film doesnt share that films fascist tint opting instead to take a more romantic approach before dutifully drenching the lush scenery in digital bloodshed. (Youve never known that so many men could lose their heads in so many different ways.) ""Pretty and there"" goes double for Pintos character the least tortured woman in sight while Dorff gets to spout the occasional innuendo with relish more typical of 300s take-it-or-leave-it tone. Evans -- already Apollo himself in Titans 2.0 -- brings a surprising amount of weight to his role as a ruler torn between obeying his own decree on Mount Olympus and saving his subjects from themselves. On the opposite end of the spectrum falls Rourke as he steps even closer to the paycheck turf of De Niro and Pacino. While his brutality seems feasible (although how many masked minions must we watch him dispatch between snacks?) the righteous anger that fuels his quest for revenge is barely there. Breaking necks is easy but a broken heart is hard to find. It ends in a numbing climax with displays of violence as fluid and florid as youll see all year and a goofy-cool tease for further adventures that I doubt will ever come to fruition. Immortals may not be as rousing as the films that came before it or the stories that have been preserved from long ago but the sweeping scope and overwrought matinee appeal remain old cheese repackaged for todays pixel-thirsty masses. This is the New Silly puffed-up style worthy of trumped-up lore and like I said thats fine.

"Immortals review A version of Greek myth for fans of 300 |       NJ.com comments Immortals review A version of Greek myth for fans of 300 Print Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate By Stephen Whitty | ArtiSyndicate The Star-Ledger Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 11 2011 at 800 AM View/Post Comments Jan ThijsHenry Cavill stars as the Greek hero Theseus in ""Immortals."" If you grew up with adventurous albeit slightly sanitized versions of the Greek myths -- Hawthornes ""Tanglewood Tales"" Harryhausens ""Jason and the Argonauts"" -- well youre a lot like me. And ""Immortals"" is not for you. But if you cant tell your Medea from Medusa -- but love the Frank Frazetta musculature and slo-mo blood-splattered violence of films such as ""300"" -- buy your ticket now. ""Immortals"" is your meat. Great big red slabs of it. The story begins with some hasty narration about the Titans and the Olympians and then proceeds right to the story of Theseus -- although no ancient would recognize it. In this version our heros a plucky peasant out to avenge the murder of his mother -- and perhaps lead the Hellenes in a fight against an evil invading king. Henry Cavill is Theseus and while hes not particularly memorable at least hes well built and promises to be a decent-looking Superman when ""Man of Steel"" is finally finished and released. Freida Pinto is Phaedra a supposedly consecrated virgin who takes one look at Theseus and forgets her vows pretty quickly. Their characters are as thin as the place mats in a Greek diner -- and bear about as much relation to the classics. But theyre pretty at least and co-star Mickey Rourke has a predictably fine time as the monstrous King Hyperion striding around and gobbling up the scenery as if it were a particularly tasty moussaka. Admitted though this movie isnt about myth or acting. What its about is the look -- and thanks to Tarsem Singh it has a striking one. The veteran music-video director has little sense of narrative but -- as he showed in his debut feature ""The Cell"" -- is gifted with a rather gruesome sense of sadistic nightmarish imagery. Decapitations emasculations and amputations abound; when that begins to pall several people are roasted alive inside a giant statue. True the 3-D doesnt look real -- at times you feel as if youre trapped inside a giant ViewMaster. But Tarsem doesnt want it to look real. He wants it to look like a dream or a nightmare and it does even if its sometimes a laughable one. (At one point Rourke shows up wearing an enormous lobster claw on his head.) Yet in the end theres little here beyond the graphic violence avant-garde costumes and occasional otherworldly visuals. When we finally go to Mount Olympus the gods look about as formidable as a bunch of unemployed chorus boys all lounging about and looking fabulous; the Minotaur turns out to be a guy in a barbed-wire bull mask. Its a movie about myth with no sense of magic. So if otherworldly wonder is what you quite reasonably expect out of a gods-and-mortals mashup -- well time to rent ""Jason and the Argonauts"" again. But if you want another dose of ""300"" -- but with more sadism this time and a dash of ersatz Hieronymous Bosch -- then ""Immortals"" is the film for you. Ratings note The film contains graphic violence nudity and sexual situations. Immortals (R) Relativity (110 min.) Directed by Tarsem Singh. With Henry Cavill Freida Pinto Mickey Rourke.

That primal family dispute kicked off Greek mythology with fables so full of vivid violence -- the beheadings bestiality and baby-drownings to mention just the ""B"" crimes -- that an ancient Athenian father might be reluctant to relate them as bedtime stories for the young. (""Not now Euripedes. When youre older."") The tales make for far more ripping yarns than the Old Testament put together; and since no one today believes in their historical or religious validity moviemakers can put them on screen full-throttle and hold the piety. The one upmarket requirement for mythological movies is that they add a tincture of rhetorical elevation to the dominant earthy elements. Recall the muscular platitudes spoken by that beefcake Barrymore Steve Reeves in the Italian Hercules epics of the late 50s and early 60s; or the stentorian verbiage upstaged by Ray Harryhausens magnificent stop-motion monsters Talos and Hydra in the 1963 Jason and the Argonauts. In Harryhausens final flirtation with mythology the 1981 Clash of the Titans no less than Laurence Olivier plays Zeus swanning through the misty temples of Olympus. So this weekends 3-D contribution to the genre the great-looking but brain-dead Immortals begins with a lofty epigram from Socrates ""All mens souls are immortal but the souls of the righteous are [immortal and] divine."" John Hurt is also here with his honeyed diction lending gravity to some of the sillier dialogue. (MORE Read Richard Corliss on the Clash of the Titans remake) No need though to consult your musty copies of Bulfinchs Mythology or Robert Graves The Greek Myths. In this take on the adventures of the god-man Theseus (Henry Cavill) and the virgin oracle Phaedra (Slumdog Millionaires Freida Pinto) later Theseus wife director Tarsem Singh and screenwriters Charley and Vlas Parlapanides turn quickly to the business of bloodletting. ""From the producers of 300"" read the ads for the star-deprived movie; and Immortals would disappoint its fan base if as in the Zack Snyder hit plenty of Greek dudes werent ground up and served as souvlaki. Theseus commences slashing as soon as a soldier spots him and his mom Aethra and refers to them as ""this bastard and his whore mother."" (Aethra had slept with two gods Aegeus and Poseidon on the same night which would make her a prostitute of the most exalted order.) Phaedra and her oracle attendants clothed in head-to-toe burkas endure reels of soldierly harassment; but when the virgin queen needs to escape her handmaiden prove wondrously efficient in the use of cutlery. (MORE Read 7 reasons why 300 was a hit) The chief perpetrator of regal sadism is Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). In the original tales Hyperion was like Theseus the miscengenated son of a god and a woman and became the insurgent leader of the Heracleans vowing to overthrow the deity dynasty that spawned him. In another story hed be the hero and Theseus fighting on Zeus side would be the counterrevolutionary villain with the Epirus bow the movies mythological MacGuffin going to the rebel winner. But here hes just all meanie which affords Rourke the chance to dish out as much punishment as he took in The Wrestler. Never was Hyperion so hyper he sets a priest on fire gouges a messengers eyes decapitates one fellow and castrates another with the remorseless stroke of a hammer. A full-service sadist Hyperion provides verbal preludes to the torture; hes the barker as well as the biter. ""Witness pain"" he warns Theseus and promises Phaedra that ""You will experience discomfort unique to your gender."" Hyperion might be alluding to the squeamishness of the traditional female audience for the movie is a feast for guys only a Grand Theft Mytho video game in 3-D apotheosizing the exploits of men who are their own gods weapons and sex objects. Not since 300 have so many well-sculpted men run around topless; watching Immortals is like walking into the shower room at the Greenwich Village Equinox. Cavill who was a finalist to play James Bond (Daniel Craig got the job) Batman (Christian Bale) Twilights Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Superman (Brandon Routh) and will finally play the reporter from Krypton in Snyders Man of Steel flexes his biceps more vigorously than his acting instrument. Zeus Luke Evans (Aramis in the latest version of The Three Musketeers) and the movies other Olympians are a generation or two younger than Olivier and his veteran colleagues in the 1981 Clash. Their smooth chests puffed up like souffles are the male equivalent of the bosoms sported by babes in the soft-core sex films that air late at night on Cinemax between the Joel Stein funny-interview segments. (Heterosexuals must make do with the brief stately consummation of the Theseus-Phaedra romance.) (MORE Check out the Top 10 Shirtless Movies) Violence check; sex check. What else? An intoxicating visualization of mythical Greece. Born in India schooled in Pasadena Tarsem (he goes by his first name) directed music videos (R.E.M.s ""Losing My Religion"") before moving to features with the sado-JLo film The Cell. His next film The Fall had an oneiric rhapsodic urgency; Roger Ebert called it ""one of the most extraordinary films Ive ever seen."" Immortals isnt in that class but it boasts beguiling geometric patterns swirling combat and a final slo-mo battle in a tunnel that plays like a close-up scrimmage of NFL mastodons and has some of the grit and grandeur of the Battle of Shrewsbury in Orson Welles Chimes at Midnight. The pity is that Tarsems intelligence doesnt connect his cinematic eye to his narrative mind. The directors visual gift is like a brilliant retina detached. For all its lustrous crimson escapism Immortals offers a few fortuitous contemporary metaphors. Its a tribute to a time when Greeks dominated the world instead of being in hock to it. The Heraclean Bull inside whose metal gut Phaedras virgins are burned alive triggers thoughts of the Wall Street bull and its protesters in nearby Zuccotti Park shivering instead of roasting. And when one of Hyperions misdeeds cues the line ""How can you stomach bearing witness to such atrocity?"" an image of Joe Paterno the graven craven Penn State coach may rise unbidden and unavoidable. A leader of young men who allowed a colleague to defile and virtually devour young boys this tale of majestic horror could be a dark chapter from the apocrypha of classical mythology.

Starring Mickey Rourke Henry Cavil Freida Pinto Kellan Lutz Director Tarsem Singh Running time 150 Release Opened Nov 11 2011  Editorial Review Immortals aims for Olympus but falls short By Mark Jenkins Nov. 11 2011 As the goriest movie ever to open with a quotation from Socrates ""Immortals"" attempts to cover itself with a patina of classical culture. But this CGI-heavy bloodbath owes less to Greek myth than to ""The Lord of the Rings"" Hong Kong costume epics and American comic books. Its fitting that the hero Theseus is played by Henry Cavill the side of British beefcake whos slated to become the new Superman in 2013s ""Man of Steel."" Based very loosely on the primordial Greek hero -- there is an encounter with a sort of Minotaur -- Theseus is a small-town prole who cares only for his mother. Because of a rough childhood he rejects the gods of Olympus as hokum. His nemesis batty King Hyperion (a typecast Mickey Rourke) believes in the gods but loathes them. He seeks the bow of Epirus the only weapon that can free the Olympians old rivals the Titans from their cell deep inside Mount Tartarus. Hyperions worldview is closer to uh reality. Theseus soon figures in the prophecies of the virgin oracle Phaedra (""Slumdog Millionaire""-ess Freida Pinto) and finds himself amid a war between the Titans and Olympians. Its hard to remain an atheist when Zeus (Luke Evans) and Athena (Isabel Lucas) keep dropping by. The movie pays less attention to theology however than decapitations castrations eviscerations and the occasional parboiling alive of people inside a giant metal bull. The blood spurts in 3-D although the third-dimension effects added after the shoot are not as striking as the general spirit of sadism. Hyperion who has a nifty collection of masks leads a horde of demonic soldiers also masked -- lets just call them Orcs. The Olympians mostly blond and dressed in matching gold armor are comparatively bland. As for Cavill his over-pumped chest blank delivery and puppy-dog eyes suggest that hell do fine as the next Clark Kent. As in his ""The Fall"" director Tarsem Singhs visual instincts overwhelm his storytelling finesse. With its images modeled on Renaissance paintings ""Immortals"" looks shadowy and solemn but its script is sometimes garbled and frequently silly. The movies self-importance is further inflated by the usual pseudo-Wagnerian score and occasional narration by John Hurt playing Theseuss humble but secretly divine mentor. He too has the gift of foresight and at the storys end he delivers a chilling if unsurprising prophecy In the heavens above he foresees a sequel.

""Release The Kra - - "" . . . Sorry wrong movie. In ""Immortals"" its ""Release the gold lame"" Also ""Unsheathe the abs"" ""Ventilate the carotids"" ""Let fly the magic neon arrows"" If someone had produced a Holy Hand Grenade I wouldnt have blinked. If its violence ye seek and violently confused storytelling look ye no further. A buffet for the retinas and a fast for the mind this gods-and-heroes tale opens with a notation that its 1228 BC and a quotation on immortal souls from Socrates (who came along so many years after 1228 BC that the time gap is equivalent to the one between Kublai Khan and Chaka Khan but whatever). In a previous war the gods defeated the Titans who have since been imprisoned in a giant box where they are arranged in rows and joined at the mouth by rods hells foosball team. A hater of supreme beings the barbarian ruler Hyperion comes growling along vowing to free the Titans make war on the gods and recover the Bow of Epirus that means supreme power. Hyperion often wears horror headgear such as a pair of bronze bunny ears and a rhinestone-covered hockey mask though when he shows his face he becomes truly scary Underneath hes Mickey Rourke. Courtesy of this mad king one guy gets both sides of his face raked and receives a giant mallet blow to his crotch -- and hes an ally. Over on the Greek side the peasant Theseus (Henry Cavill) is proving to be a ready warrior (he hasnt figured out his kindly old dad played by John Hurt is really Zeus) who gets miffed when Hyperion slashes his moms throat. Theseus goes into slavery like Ben-Hur but we never appreciate his struggle. Every 15 minutes or so he runs his sword through a few gross of embarrassingly killable enemy soldiers. If he really gets in trouble he gets rescued either by a virgin oracle (Freida Pinto) with a habit of seeing hazy visions of the future or by the gods who keep zooming down from heaven in their shiny golden cabana-wear to murder the Greeks enemies. Incidentally this movie breaks with the Laurence Olivier/Liam Neeson school of casting immortals. When not in disguise Zeus and his fellow deities look like they just graduated high school and lounge around sensuously half-naked. Maybe they live on Mt. Abercrombie. Think of ""Immortals"" as the ""Twilight"" of the gods. Director Tarsem Singh whose only previous major film was the 2000 Jennifer Lopez fantasy ""The Cell"" does not have a brilliant script to work with (the would-be cynical wisecracks of the would-be Han Solo figure played by Stephen Dorff fail to jolly up the bits between the bloodbaths). And what Singh has got he garbles. Somewhere in the confusion the magic bow switches owners (twice) but you barely notice even though its supposed to be the most important object in the world. The climax can best be described as a giant meaningless whoosh. When Theseus gives his troops a forgettable motivational speech the moment is supposed to be all ""Henry V"" but as the men start banging rhythmically on their shields its more like ""Stomp."" Its impossible to tell whether Cavill will make a good Superman (his next big role) because Singh cares so little about people. His idea of the way to handle stilted dialogue is to break it up with long awkward pauses. Everything is as stiff as a Charlton Heston movie minus the cornball appeal. Where Singh excels is in those spooky gorgeous visuals. You can see the influence of modernists like De Chirico. As in ""The Cell"" he provides heaps of freaky costumes geometric forms and stark central images framed by nothingness. Young Theseus it turns out trained as a swordsman by um beating up a tree. How is a fixed object to provide lessons in fluid combat? Forget it Singh just likes the look of the lone crooked growth against an infinity of nothingness. At the end his camera looks up the crotches of flying warriors hurling themselves across the firmament as if in perpetual sky battle. Spectacularly silly? Yes but at least its spectacular.

"Immortals Movie review - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Henry CavillMovie review Henry Cavill is mighty in ImmortalsHenry Cavill is mighty as Theseus in Tarsem Singhs visually impressive 3-D work but the Greek mythology-inspired story around him makes no sense.November 11 2011|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Henry Cavill stars in ""Immortals."" (Jan Thijs / War of the Gods...)Where are the gods of Olympus when you need them? I ask on behalf of ""Immortals"" because mere mortals were apparently not able to create a movie that actually made sense. I realize that making ""Immortals"" immortal was way too much to ask but frankly just a shade more plausible not to mention pleasurable would have been nice. Now if beauty were enough to carry the day then this 3-D stunner with its star Henry Cavill looking like he was plucked out of a Caravaggio painting or the cover of Mens Health would be fine as it is. With dark soulful eyes and rippling abs Cavill is magnetic as Theseus the slave-hero of the film. In fact few cleft chins since Robert Mitchum have had so much screen-grabbing potential. So dashing is he in those slave rags that it is easy to understand why the films resident mystic a the Virgin Oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto draped in diaphanous robes that are remarkable for their reveals) a might consider giving up her um visions to be with him. As the massive marketing campaign screams a this is a film from the people who brought you ""300."" Yes but. ""300"" was more than the sum of its glorious graphic parts. It had classic bloodlines inside a terrific story and director Zack Snyder made great use of both the highly stylized surface gloss and the substance. ""Immortals"" not so much. Director Tarsem Singh indeed shaping up to be a visual visionary (""The Fall"" ""The Cell"") has crafted a film that often looks like it was lifted frame by frame from one of those gorgeous coffee table books on Renaissance art. For a while the graphic novel style is so spectacular a dusky villages carved into the sheerest of cliffs endless stretches of desert where you can count every grain of sand oil-slicked seas just dying to be roiled by a storm a that it is distraction enough. But before you go floating off into the clouds with Zeus (Luke Evans) Athena (Isabel Lucas) Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and the rest heres the problem the script. Its writers Greek American brothers Charley and Vlas Parlapanides have definitely been inspired by Greek mythology because they seem inclined to reference all of it. Or most of it. To that overflowing pile they add a few more legends of their own. What is lost is some sort of internal unifying logic. Even the most illogical of imaginary worlds have that or at least those that work. Singh working with the versatile director of photography Brendan Galvin (""Behind Enemy Lines"" and the directors upcoming dark take on the Snow White fable ""Mirror Mirror"") and an exceptional production/costume/effects crew opens with a lingering shot of the magical box that imprisons the vicious Titans. Theyve been held in a kind of suspended state for who knows how many years. Its a very cool scene like youve stumbled into a great archaeological dig with the Titans all encrusted in sand still standing at attention (the chains help). Their claim to fame is that if theyre unleashed they will kill all the gods and all the people too so you best leave this box alone. But we all know what humans do when temptation stares us in the face a we bite the apple we lift the lid. The guy most likely to do it here is King Hyperion a despot in the making who sounds like Darth Vader but is actually played by a bearded buffed and sweat-slicked Mickey Rourke channeling a lifetime of leftover rage he has hanging around. Hyperion is the one who will whip things to a frenzy as he schemes to unleash the Titans find the Bow of Epirus (its magic) rule the world and slaughter any human he runs into. Even more important hes got all kinds of implements of torture which he likes to employ. As does Singh. The filmmaker has taken special care to choreograph pain in fierce fashion a ordinary 3-D bloodletting and sword fighting is really not enough. All the unimaginable ways to inflict a world of hurt are imagined here in frightful images that seem to rise right off the screen. Whats missing is the emotion that might have lifted the film and us as well. Meanwhile Theseus has a lot on his plate the meat-and-potatoes stuff required of any hero. As it happens Cavill actually knows how to milk his superhero moments (which Im sure has the upcoming ""Man of Steel"" folks breathing a sigh of relief). Meanwhile his slave sidekick Stavros (Stephen Dorff) gets all the funny lines which he delivers quite deftly. Lots more stuff keeps happening. But at some point you will wonder a will this never end? Even the Gods weep at the answer to that one.... betsy.sharkeylatimes.com MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESSix lessons from Man of Steels successJune 17 2013Summer Movie Sneaks complete listApril 28 2013Words cant express on the slowest movie weekend since...September 9 2012Still in Possession of the box officeSeptember 9 2012Game of Thrones new on DVD not the typical TV fantasy...March 4 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTHenry CavillKellan LutzTheseusCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/la-et-immortals-20111111,0,6964215.story?track=rss",200,immortals17,immortals,latimes

Not since ""300"" has so much Greek flesh been bared in service of such gratuitous carnage. As that beefcake battle epic did before ""Immortals"" challenges auds to follow its bastardized version of Hellenic history amid a sea of chiseled abs grizzled faces and digital set extensions. Rather than cribbing from comics however director Tarsem Singh Dhandwar joins a long line of artists who loosely referenced Greek mythology to create stunning visual interpretations. Absent a compelling narrative the spectacle alone may be enough to survive opening weekend only to see returns for this style-over-substance exercise wither over the following weeks. ""Immortals"" fate lies not with the gods but with fanboys who have no doubt heard of Theseus (played by ""Man of Steel""-in-the-making Henry Cavill). They may even recall that Theseus slew the Minotaur. Any further familiarity with Greek mythology will merely get in the way of this slow-building hyperstylized pastiche which draws upon the helmers many influences from the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel to the gold-toned vistas of Pasolinis ""Arabian Nights"" with room for rich multiculti costumes (simultaneously Greek Indian and Orc-like) and Hong Kong fight choreography in the same frame. The script by Parlapanides brothers Charles and Vlas tells the story of how Theseus -- demoted from Athenian king to cliff-dwelling peasant -- achieved immortality via a sort of heroic martyrdom living on (through song and overwrought Hollywood blockbusters) while vengeful Hyperion (a snarling spitting Mickey Rourke) found a loophole through which he could rob the gods of their immortality by unleashing Titans capable of killing the otherwise invincible beings. Rather than singing of self-inflicted ruin here the concept of tragedy relies on the notion that auds will feel sadness when witnessing the death of sympathetic and/or perfectly sculpted characters. Actors dont come much more divinely formed than Cavill -- he of cleft chin and abs who evidently shaves his chest more frequently than he does his cheeks. Charismatic enough to hold our attention against the films breathtaking backdrops Cavill plays Theseus as an almost messianic figure hand-picked by the gods to redeem the human race. Zeus himself (Luke Evans looking rather chiseled) coaches the Hellenic hero though he does so disguised as an elderly man (John Hurt) so as not to blow his cover. Though Hyperions beef is with the gods Zeus forbids his children from interfering in the affairs of men forcing the likes of Athena (Isabel Lucas) Aries (Daniel Sharman) and Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) to watch half-naked from on high while Hyperion hunts for the Epirus Bow -- a weapon with the power to slay immortals. Should any of the gods disobey and come to Theseus aid Zeus vows to kill them. When it comes to ""Immortals"" shaky grasp of its own title perhaps ""The Princess Brides"" Inigo Montoya put it best ""You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."" The pics mythological basis serves only insofar as it allows Tarsem to create a series of iconic tableaux vivants treating each shot as if it were an elaborate painting. With few exceptions -- the most engaging of which is Theseus run-in with a bull-headed thug in the labyrinth -- adjacent shots seldom work together to sustain dramatic energy. Instead auds are meant to marvel at the impressive composition of every frame significantly enhanced by Tarsems savvy use of depth in stereoscopic 3D. Although one is never less than aware of the films greenscreen format credit is due the many effects houses whose richly textured work creates a unified world in which such silliness may take itself seriously right down to the virtual lens flares. None is more earnest than Rourke whose larger-than-life persona makes him a formidable villain even without the nightmarish armor he wears into battle or the deafeningly intense chorus of horns and chanting supplied by composer Trevor Morris. Considering the directors previous attempt at more humanistic storytelling ""The Fall"" struggled to reach even a cult following the extreme brutality of ""Immortals"" may well have been a concession to popular tastes. Yet such an unsavory mix of body worship and sadistic ultra-violence breeds confusion as when the pic manipulates auds to fear that virginal Phaedra (an objectified Freida Pinto) may be gang-raped by Hyperions soldiers one moment only to show her willfully submitting to Theseus a short time later. Navigating the films mounting erotic bloodlust proves tedious until the show-stopping final battle between gods and Titans in one chamber Theseus and Hyperion in another at which point logic melts away completely and the pics raison detre emerges -- namely to justify staging a fight scene for the ages.

Daily Edition Login to download Immortals Film Review 350 PM PST 11/10/2011 by Todd McCarthy FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Relativity Visually stunning but heavy-handed and lacking a single moment that evinces any relish for movie-making. TWITTER Henry Cavill stars as a Theseus a peasant tasked with defending the world from the evil King Hyperion in Tarsem Singhs Greek God epic. Theres nothing wrong with Immortals that a commentary track from Mystery Science Theater 3000 wouldnt fix. Thuddingly ponderous heavy-handed and lacking a single moment that evinces any relish for movie-making this lurch back from the ""history"" of 300 into the mists of Greek myth is a drag in nearly every way from the particulars of physical torture to the pounding score that wont quit. As if poor beleaguered Greece needs this right now a bad film about its unruly gods and founders. Still a certain percentage of the public that made 300 such a big worldwide hit will automatically turn out for this similar-looking visual effects-dominated action epic but final commercial results look to fall well short of those of its predecessor. PHOTOS Immortals Premiere Red Carpet Arrivals To his credit director Tarsem Singh Dhandwar (billed on previous films as just Tarsem or Tarsem Singh--his name grows with his pretentions) does create a visual world here that represents a heightened reality; the dramatic landscapes enormous vistas brilliant skies dramatic architecture and wild costumes overlap with but are not constrained by the real world or historical locations. At the same time however it all feels cramped and claustrophobic; the villages and encampments are mostly tucked on ledges along the edges of sheer cliffs boxing everyone in; the gods peer down on human endeavor from perilous precipices and even the climactic battle is largely fought in a long low-ceilinged tunnel all of this one deduces due to the fact that the actors were positioned in small spaces in front of screens upon which the backgrounds would later be filled in. The 3D notwithstanding its almost as if youre watching actors on a stage in front of painted backdrops. The technology looks to have hemmed in the spectacle. The ancient tales relating to the wild ways of the mythical gods can be confusing under the best of circumstances; its a challenge even getting your head around the paternity of this films hero Theseus as he was supposedly both divine and mortal by virtue of the fact that on the night of his conception his mother Aethra slept with both Poseidon and Aegeus. So you cant blame brother screenwriters Charles and Vlas Parlapanides for simplifying matters by making King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke) a plain and simple murderous maniac bent upon not only eliminating all human opposition in Greece in the year 1228 B.C. to be absolutely precise but liberating his long-imprisoned fellow Titans and unseating the gods of Olympus. VIDEO Immortals Stephen Dorff Says Hes the Han Solo of the Greek God Tale What will clinch the deal for Hyperion is finding the elusive Bow of Epirus an ancient equivalent of a sub-machine gun capable of shooting an unlimited number of magically produced arrows in rapid succession. Beating him to it is man of the people Theseus (Henry Cavill) convulsed into action by the annihilation of his village and Hyperions sadistic murder of his mother and inspired by the visions of the Sybelline Oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto). Any number of early scenes are devoted to demonstrating what a bad idea it is to come to the attention of Hyperion. Proving that given the chance based on his career resurrection with The Wrestler Rourke is capable of taking paycheck roles in a whole new slew of bad movies the actor skulks around with massive scars on his face that must have been caused by too carelessly donning one of his own beclawed masks. As Hyperion dispatches even sycophants bearing good tidings and prolongs his victims pain in novel ways such as cooking them alive inside a hollow silver minotaur Rourke employs a basso profondo as an intimation of the seismic waves he intends to unleash upon the entire Greek cosmos. Its ham sliced thick and as such worthy of a wink and a nod. VIDEO Henry Cavill Gets Angry In a New Immortals Clip But if fun is what his performance even is there is none else to be found here. 300 which was produced by two of this films producers Gianni Nunari and Mark Canton at least had a certain unembarrassed blood lust hot stuff between Gerard Butler and Lena Headey amusingly overbuffed bodies and a sly homoerotic undertow that went with it. Immortals is not only entirely without humor but is dominated by a lot of huffing and puffing thunderous self-importance and windy Socratic quotations about the immortality and divinity of mens souls. You just have to roll your eyes after a while. STORY Inside the Immortals Premiere Director Tarsem Laments 300 Comparisons Assigned to save the Greek world here Cavill will be the subject of additional scrutiny here as his next assignment is to save the American way of life as Superman. Hes handsome lean and ripped here but increasingly displays his English accent the more he bellows something one can only hope he does less of in Man of Steel Stephen Dorff is rather less imposing as an impudent slave who fights alongside him and no matter how many suggestive remarks he makes is never going to prevail for the attentions of Phaedra capably embodied by Pinto just about the only one in the cast not required to shout or roar most of her lines. The most eye-catching creative contribution consists of Eiko Ishiokas sometimes striking costume designs which not only functionally differentiate the assorted factions but often pop the eyes even against the colorful backgrounds.

Credit Jan Thijs/Relativity Media Sing to me O Muse of gods and men of timeless legends and forgettable retreads. Speak of ""Immortals"" and answer in all seriousness did you even read that awful script?As Greece teeters on the edge of financial collapse the producers of ""300"" seem eager to dropkick the country into a cultural abyss. Their latest sword-and-sandals spectacular ""Immortals"" plunders the canon of ancient myths like a barbarian horde piling up spoils as the temple burns. This jumbled epic of absurd coincidences and logical gaps can barely track its internal mythology. Such nonsense defies synopsis. Suffice it to say that there are muscly he-men (Henry Cavill) distressed damsels (Freida Pinto) evil despots (Mickey Rourke) and vengeful gods (John Hurt).""Immortals"" is the latest disaster of post-conversion 3-D a projected spectacle so dark it is literally hard to see. This is an ugly burlap sack of a film stitched with jagged seams and overstuffed with computer-generated chintz gold-lame leotards and fetishistic headgear.The choreography of flying viscera and cartoonish blood splattering is only occasionally inventive. The adolescent violence would be boringly unobjectionable but its overtones of sexual sadism are crude and creepy. ""A mans seed can be his most brutal weapon"" says Mr. Rourke as the monstrous King Hyperion in what is definitely the films grossest line though not its most ridiculous.The queasy combo of childish fantasy and adult desire has become a signature of the self-described ""visionary"" director Tarsem Singh whose debut film ""The Cell"" looked like a sex dungeon designed by the bubble-gum-pop artist Lisa Frank. His garish color palette continues to fascinate and repulse.To coin a tagline This -- is -- stupid.""Immortals"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Sexualized violence and blood-choked depravity.

(Jan Thijs/) Elizabeth Weitzman NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Thursday November 10 2011 300 PM Title Immortals Film Info With Mickey Rourke Henry Cavill. Epic about a peasant chosen to stop a ruthless king in ancient Greece. Director Tarsem Singh (150). R Graphic violence sexuality. At area theaters. Tarsem Singhs first two films ""The Cell"" and ""The Fall"" were shallow but exquisite displays designed almost entirely to show off his extraordinary artistry. With ""Immortals"" Singh finally acknowledges that hes making movies rather than just beautiful moving pictures. In his ostentatiously unconventional take on ancient Greek history he gives us fully fleshed characters and a compelling (enough) plot plus all the action an epic requires. And true to form its also the most gorgeous film of the year. Henry Cavill wholl soon suit up as our new Superman shows off his abs of steel as Theseus a peasant chosen by Zeus (Luke Evans) to challenge power-mad King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). A violent lunatic with a penchant for creatively creepy masks Hyperion aims to control all of Greece -- and thats just for starters. Only Theseus his best friend Stavros (Stephen Dorff) and the oracle Phaedra (a muted Freida Pinto) have the power to stop him before humanity is destroyed. Henry Cavill stars as Theseus who must challenge King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke). (Jan Thijs/photo Jan Thijs) The script by brothers Charley and Vlas Parlapanides was clearly written in service of the breathtaking imagery. But its solid enough to keep us interested and the actors approach this B-movie material with commendably straight faces. Any project featuring Rourke as an unhinged sadist cant take itself too seriously and he delivers with a scenery-chewing turn that meshes well with Cavills earnest charisma. Still the effects are the real draw and this is one of the few films entirely worth the extra cost of a 3-D ticket. Every scene whether a quiet conversation or an outrageously bloody battle is layered with striking sights that demand a second viewing. From cinematography to costumes to set design each visual aspect was clearly planned down to the smallest detail. It must be said that ""Immortals"" is pulpy fun that feels utterly ludicrous whenever it hints at more solemn aspirations. But thats okay. A popcorn movie has one goal and thats to entertain. ""Immortals"" meets this criteria handily and serves as a splendid spectacle besides.

But for all the digital mastery Immortals boasts its hokey story leaves the film adrift.Henry Cavill cast as Superman in Zack Snyders Man of Steel next year plays Theseus a peasant who leads a rebellion against the wicked King Hyperion (Mickey Rourke the highlight of the film). Muscular oily and full of resentment Cavill makes a fine perturbed peasant though hes got a tough bill sharing the most scenes with Rourke.Sporting a stunning mask that makes him look like hes being eaten by a barracuda Hyperion plows a swath of carnage as he ransacks Greece in search of the Epirus Bow a weapon that could destroy Hyperions immortal nemeses -- namely Zeus (Luke Evans) Poseidon (Kellan Lutz) and Athena (Isabel Lucas).About the movieImmortals   out of fourStars Henry Cavill Stehen Dorff Freida Pinto Mickey Rourke Director Tarsem SinghDistributor Relativity Media Rating R for sequences of strong bloody violence and a scene of sexuality Running time 1 hour 50 minutes Opens nationwide FridayRourke who played a Russian villain in Iron Man 2 has a field day here killing innocents and taking a sledgehammer to his enemys testicles.And Immortals would have soared with more antagonists like Hyperion but the movie is oddly void of much other menace. Hyperions henchmen also wear hip get-ups but their voices are milquetoast and muffled as if theyre reading lines behind their masks. It gives them the ominousness of teenage trick-or-treaters.Singh whose other films include The Cell and The Fall remains a visual master. The computer-generated landscapes are stunning and the 3-D is serviceable though the movie isnt as striking as Singhs 2-D The Cell.And a few actors rise above the stilted narrative particularly Stephen Dorff whose randy rebel Stavros provides the movie its emotion and humorInstead what undercuts sharper than Poseidons trident is a script that sees its characters as cardboard not flesh and blood. For a film meant to be spectacle over substance its not a fatal blow. But it is a mortal wound. For more information about reprints amp; permissions visit our FAQs.
