"Now Playing Seven Movies to See or Skip << Search Search Search Menu Search Features The Triangle The Hollywood Prospectus Contributors Podcasts Video Quarterly ESPN.com Now Playing Seven Movies to See or Skip Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features Anna Kendrick April 12 2013 by Wesley Morris Facebook Twitter Print Sometimes movies slip through the cracks and for better or worse I catch up with them. Heres a handful all directed by a range of men from an Italian visionary to some dude named Robert Redford. The Place Beyond the Pines directed by Derek Cianfrance A slow-burning drama told in three connected movements all featuring an unusually haggard unusually good Eva Mendes. The first has Ryan Gosling doing a version of his Drive persona a bank-robbing tattooed stunt biker living in Schenectady (a Mohawk word that gives the movie its title). The second miscasts Bradley Cooper as a lawyer turned cop in the same town. The last has two fantastic performances from Emory Cohen and Dane DeHaan whose relationship to each other and the rest of the movie is basically from the people who brought you Romeo and Juliet. What Cianfrance has written has scraps of surprise and a fine chase sequence but it doesnt reach for the stars or the emotional cosmos -- or at least it doesnt know how to get there. Hes given us plot points and episodes in search of thriller and tragedy. But no suspense. His previous movie with Gosling 2010s martial-disaster drama Blue Valentine was similarly unsure about how to build into something greater than shouts and murmurs. This time you wonder whether Cianfrance reached the films final third and realized that this was his movie two high school burnouts who fascinate each other. But he had Gosling and Cooper and probably couldnt turn back. Once Ray Liotta shows up as his umpteenth crook its tempting to believe that a piece of software made the whole movie happen. The Company You Keep directed by Robert Redford This is the most depressing movie ever made about radicalism. Not only because it makes no sense but because it confirms that theres so much pressure to make serious movies whose seriousness doesnt scare off anybody that the resulting movies are just seriously dull. This one stars Redford who has aged into a liberal of excruciating earnestness and aspires to be an important political thriller. Theres one problem There are no politics. Lem Dobbs is the credited screenwriter and you can see what Redford might have sensed in the script -- a bratty reporter from the ""Albany Sun Times"" (Shia LaBeouf) elbows his way into a series of stories about some former Weather Underground guerrillas who gradually come out of hiding when one is arrested after 30 years. The movie also stars Julie Christie Susan Sarandon Anna Kendrick Richard Jenkins Terrence Howard Nick Nolte Brendan Gleeson Sam Elliott Stephen Root and Brit Marling as LaBeoufs Daryl Hannah distraction. At some point theyre not acting in a movie. Theyre signing a petition. But for what? The whole thing builds to an encounter with Redford Christie and their respective lighting. Hearing them talk about their bygone radical days is absurd like listening to two glasses of Chardonnay reminisce about how they wrote ""Fight the Power."" Gimme the Loot directed by Adam Leon Theres a kind of first movie that leaves you exhilarated by the minty-freshness of its firstness. Amid all the copycatting and pricey bombast and genericness heres a movie that looks like it hails from a real place; whose characters sound like they come from somewhere; whose stakes are stresslessly low. Some of the happiness in watching Leons first movie is a matter of timing Its seasonal. Set all over New York during the sweaty apex of baseball season the comedy splits up two teenage taggers -- Sofia (Tashiana Washington) and Malcolm (Ty Hickson) -- and has each try to scrape together enough money to gain them illegal entry to Citi Field where they hope to graffiti-bomb the Mets home-run apple. Malcolm scams himself some weed and winds up fooling around with his first house call a dopey debutante (Zoe Lescaze). Hes so high on her that when he has to make a emergency exit he barely notices that hes left behind his sneakers. The image of a sweet-natured black guy walking around New York in his stocking feet is a great cultural sight gag. Sofias the harder of the two and has a much tougher day. Shes roughed up robbed and ripped off but it doesnt faze her. When she catches up with a kid who helped steal her bike she slaps the shit out of him. The movie has a lot of amateur scruff. But Leons talent is all in his touch. He insists on a lightness that doesnt cheapen anybody or sugarcoat all the cursing and crime. This is life in New York City and sometimes even the bad news is funny. He understands the socioeconomic discrepancies without inflicting them upon anybody. Inequality is circumstance. It doesnt have to be a state of mind. Another older director (Leons 31) would have drummed up some guilty drama. But Leon who trained with Woody Allen keeps finding more comedy. Theres a kid on a basketball court who comes on to Sofia with some filthy talk about certain smells of summer. Shes there for business but as she talks to another guy you can still see the other kid in the background humping the fence like a dirty puppy. The whole film is funny and true that way. You used to be able to find a movie like this at Sundance. But young so-called independent American filmmaking is currently oily with slickness and money and under so many influences that you cant tell where a new voice begins and some secondhand vision ends. (The movie showed up at other festivals including Cannes last year and is playing on fewer than a dozen screens at the moment.) Leons time with Allen has helped give him a tone (damn if Hickson doesnt have some of Allens nervous shiftiness) and a taste for a sideways soundtrack (the title comes from the Notorious B.I.G. but the music here is all subway gospel and picnic funk). Nonetheless Leon appears to have seen Allens sanitized New York and wondered where the rest of the city went. Hes restored the grit color vernacular and vulgarity. Leon hasnt copied Allen. Hes tagged him. Reality directed by Matteo Garrone In 2008 Garrones Gomorrah was as panoramic a mob-bound crime opus as you could hope to see. It had the sweep of a tragedy the force of a wrecking ball and the craftsmanship of a pointillist. This new movie is set like its predecessor amid the decay of Naples but lacks that films hell-on-Earth tonnage. For one thing Garrone doesnt have the galvanic journalistic source material Roberto Savianos nonfiction book that gave Gomorrah its force. But he does employ the same dreamed-up documentary tone to observe a grifting Neapolitan fishmonger named Luciano (Aniello Arena) as he falls into an obsession with becoming a cast member on Big Brother. The camera often seems to float and hover like some alien presence. That detachment creates a kind of transparency even as Garrone conjures low-key Fellini gaudiness -- physical corpulence decadent air weddings malls nightclubs and an empty water park. By the time Luciano enters the storied Cinecitta production complex where Fellini once made his masterpieces and the Big Brother lair lives its clear that Garrone is lamenting the death of culture. But the movie is more compassionate than screed-y. Its a portrait of the preoccupation with fame in an age in which in fame is cheap. Luciano doesnt want to be a Marcello Mastroianni. He wants to be an oversexed clown on a reality show. Still his lust for celebrity is real and destructive. He convinces himself that television producers have dispatched spies to watch him. That paranoia starts to fray his psyche and marriage (Loredana Simioli plays his ferocious wife and shes great). Arena was once a gangster and his muscles and tattoos belie his guilelessness. The youth in his haircut and dye job are betrayed by the little gray tufts at the back of his neck. Hes a middle-aged man who hasnt grown up -- Italian movies know that character well. But Garrone doesnt back away. He affixes all his style to Lucianos obsession and entertains the corrosive lunacy of his pathetic dream. This movie opened a month ago. See it in a theater while you can. Tyler Perrys Temptation Confessions of a Marriage Counselor directed by ... take a wild guess Perry has an address in Atlanta but he no longer lives on this planet. His movies have Kim Kardashian yet have nothing to do with glamour. They remain churchy but have nothing to do with God. If he ever caught the spirit he caught it like a cold. Perry is rich famous successful and obviously at some kind of commercial crossroads. What does he want to mean to us? What does he want to mean to himself? Weve gotten 14 movies in eight years and this new one leaves you with the very real impression thats he running out of interest and ideas. He gives us a two-hour flashback in which an aspiring D.C. marriage counselor named Judith (Jurnee Smollett-Bell) gets hooked on a rich severely fit psychopath (Robbie Jones) whos only slightly less severely fit than her husband (Lance Gross). Oh the symbolism The psycho drives a satanically red sports car; the husband drives rickety salt-of-the-earth pickup. Brandy spends a lot of her scenes with her guard and hoodie up. Kardashian has put-downs for Judith at the same workplace where Vanessa Williamss ""French"" ""accent"" sucks up all the air. And Ella Joyce arrives for what could have been an amazing exorcism but all that praying goes nowhere but the Kleenex box. Perrys movies have become so thematically grandiose visually incoherent and self-defensively bourgeois that the only way to receive them lately is as a cynic. Four years ago when Dwayne Johnson picked up Janet Jackson at the end of Why Did I Get Married Too? you felt like Perry was ready to give us the easy black romance the movies have suppressed. But no one has it easy in a Perry movie. Now hes pushing moral redundancy. HIV returns as some kind of divine guarantee that a woman will never love again. Perrys become a cynic too. Temptation opened two weeks ago and is a hit but at this point Tyler Perrys Colonoscopy would make 60 million. Theres no care here no sign that he expects an audience to want more than sucked teeth rolled eyes and powdered drama. In fact hes so powerful and so necessary that you worry no one can talk him out of anything. When Jones and Smollett-Bell make love in the psychos bathtub Perry doesnt even bother to clear the steam. Were looking at nothing but brown spots and vapor. You hate to say it but thats symbolism. Blancanieves directed by Pablo Berger When people were going nuts for The Artist a couple of years ago all I could think was ""Theres got to be a better way."" The Artist was a silent movie about silent movies. It encouraged nostalgia for bygone Hollywood moviemaking. That was fine but I wanted something crazier than cute romance something kinkier than stage kisses something that knows theres nothing sacred about intertitles and iris-eyes that you can do everything with them. I wanted profanity. I wanted exuberance. I wanted a movie that say relocated Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to 1920s Spain the world of bullfighting and the realm of Samp;M. I wanted Blancanieves which is as silent and black-and-white as The Artist. A famous matador (Daniel Gimenez Cacho) his comically evil wife (Maribel Verdu) her charming stepdaughter (first Sofia Oria; then as an adult Macarena Garcia) dancing camerawork dreamy editing storybook art direction This is what Pedro Almodovar would do if he werent burdened with the creative headache of being Pedro Almodovar. What Berger does with the actors the sight gags the close-ups the music the photography is close to perfection. The movies energy might wipe you out. But the lightness of Bergers touch and the modernness of his style is the antidote to The Artists labor and reverential antiquity. He knows silent movies can do more than collect museum dust. They can get down and dirty. Upstream Color directed by Shane Carruth For about an hour Shane Carruths second movie in nine years (his first was Primer) rewards the work required to watch it. We dont know why a scientist whos harvesting butterflies and inspiring kids to do elaborate hand choreography is also hypnotizing an office drone (Amy Seimetz) to empty her bank accounts for him. Why has he turned her body into a worm-infested science project? Why does the crisp-looking film noir shed its skin and scramble itself into a stunted romance between the drone and a man she meets on a train? Why does that lead to a closing chapter featuring sound fields flowers and someplace called Quinoa Valley? Why ask why when ultimately the question with Carruth is what What now what next what the fuck? Its not enough to suppose as people have been doing that this movie is about identity. Lots of movies are. Identity Thief is a movie about identity. Its as if Carruth -- who in addition to writing directing editing scoring and starring in this movie is also distributing it on his own -- wants to communicate with us but keeps getting in his own way. He wants us to feel his movie He appropriates recognizable genres and casts attractive people including himself. But he seems terrified not of being misunderstood but of being comprehended. Is success too conventional an outcome for him? Accurate though the science here might be its also impenetrable. What the movie points to is worth following until youre left with an enormous map that you spend the rest of the drive trying to refold. There are ellipses and earnestness right out of Terrence Malick; and as with Malick we have to talk about Carruth with utmost care lest the truth about the frustrations of his obvious talent send him further into reclusion lest we bruise him. This movie will really speak to a lot of people. Some will see an arcane feat of genius. Some will see it for what it is a work of cultural autism.

Comments (4) click to enlarge The Place Beyond the Pines Recommended Video Watch on Amazon Rated R  140 minutes  2013 A motorcycle stunt rider (Ryan Gosling) discovers that the woman he loved and left a year earlier (Eva Mendes) has given birth to a son by him and his half-baked decision to become a better father ends tragically. This naturalistic drama is ambitious to the point of being unwieldy and after a while it begins trotting out familiar characters (Ray Liotta as a dirty cop) and situations (an execution in the woods a la Millers Crossing). But once the story has advanced from one generation to the next and its thematic sweep has become apparent these flaws seem much more tolerable. Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) directed a script he cowrote with Ben Coccio whose stunning debut feature Zero Day (2003) deserves a much wider audience. By J.R.

The Place Beyond the Pines (R) | miami.com Home Nightlife Restaurants Hotels See amp; Do Movies Shopping Events Visual Arts Guides Espanol Review The Place Beyond the Pines (R) Director Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) stumbles with this overambitious and overlong drama. Share Print Save to your profile By Rene Rodriguez rrodriguezMiamiHerald.com4/11/2013 Editor rating 2 The Place Beyond the Pines the new film by the director of Blue Valentine does not lack for ambition. Beginning with its bravura opening shot -- an uninterrupted take of Luke (Ryan Gosling) a motorcycle stunt rider as he dresses in his tent and walks through a carnival to the stage where hell be performing -- director Derek Cianfrance lets us know hes working on a larger canvas. This is a drama spanning two generations. But while the scope of the movie is bigger its impact is smaller. Blue Valentine was a precise heartrending portrait of a marriage coming apart at the seams. The theme of his new movie is a lot harder to discern. Gosling his body covered in tattoos and his hair dyed straw-blond is duplicating his performance from Drive here all stoic airs and thoughtful stares and moments of explosive physical motion. Luke is a quiet loner who seems to have no familial or friendly ties. But then his carnival passes through Schenectady and he discovers he has a 1-year old son -- the fruit of a one-night stand with Romina (Eva Mendes) to whom he hasnt spoken since. Fatherhood awakens a selflessness in Luke -- a desire to provide for his family even though Romina is in a relationship with a good man -- and he quits the circus and stays in town intending to work at an auto repair shop. Instead he ends up robbing banks. Thats only the setup for The Place Beyond the Pines a movie that reaches much further (and lasts much longer; nearly 2 and 1/2 hours) than the beginning implies. Bradley Cooper figures prominently as a rookie cop with political aspirations. Ray Liotta is at his slimy best as a crooked detective capable of murder. Dane DeHaan (Chronicle) and Emory Cohen are a pair of high schoolers experimenting with drugs. How and why their stories connect is startling in moments contrived in others and overall rarely believable. Its good to see Mendes in a role that uses her for more than her looks Her longing for Luke a man she assumed she would never see again is unspoken but palpable. Cooper continues to prove The Silver Linings Playbook was no fluke Here is an actor who gets better with every movie. But no amount of good acting or beautiful cinematography (shot by Sean Bobbitt) can rescue a movie that is this belabored and prolonged only to illustrate a banal (and telegraphed) message about how the sins of the father are handed down to their sons. Early in the movie theres a scene in which three characters pose for a photograph and you immediately guess that photo will reappear later on in a moment designed to elicit tears. Cue the violins. Blue Valentine was tough and honest and brutal about human relationships and the ways in which we sometimes hurt the ones we love most. But The Place Beyond the Pines is hackneyed and dull Not a single moment rings true.

Introduced by a long tracking shot that concludes with a dangerous whirl inside a spherical cage hes a man going nowhere in a hurry.Article Continued BelowThe roads and tattoos make apt metaphors for this entangled drama by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) who shares a sensibility with the likes of Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Denis Villeneuve with his ambitious storytelling. At once expansive and intimate The Place Beyond the Pines flirts with exhaustion and threatens credulity with its extreme generational conflicts and use of coincidence. Cianfrance and his sterling cast keep it all together vanquishing doubt and soap suds. Theres a palpable sense of teamwork that brings out the best in all of these players.The Place Beyond the Pines is actually three interlocking stories in one the first concerning Lukes headlong ride into destiny. Just as he removes the helmet from his bottle-blonde locks hes met by Romina (Eva Mendes) the girlfriend he wooed and abandoned the last time the circus was in town.Eva lives with a new man (Mahershala Ali) but she still has feelings for Luke and theres much more to the connection that this. Luke ever reckless decides hes going to quit the fair and get back with Romina new boyfriend be damned. He gets a job at a mechanics shop run by fellow neer-do-well Robin (Killing Them Softlys Ben Mendelsohn) but before long the two are chasing bigger money brazenly robbing local banks.An abrupt twist to the tale turns the focus upon Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) a rookie Schenectady cop whose pursuit of Luke leaves him injured and with a heros citation. His fellow officers led by a cynical veteran (Ray Liotta) want Cross to cash in on his kudos by participating in a raid that will send ill-gotten loot their way.Cross first balks and then counters but hes not quite as squeaky-clean as he seems. Hes prepared to do the right thing but for the wrong reasons. He demands an unwarranted promotion from a police superior (Bruce Greenwood) who warns him ""Youre too smart for your own good.""These words will echo as the film jumps 15 years and two other major figures join the ever-expanding cast troubled youths played with bravura skill by Dane DeHaan (Chronicle) and Emory Cohen (New York I Love You). Some might say that Cianfrance and his co-writers Ben Coccio and Darius Marder are also too clever for their own good in the way they resolve the films three distinct chapters.But when you really think about it The Place Beyond the Pines isnt all that far-fetched. What we call coincidences are often the unforeseen consequences of actions taken and connections made along the tangled road of life.Things like what a character is referring to when he says to another ""If you ride like lightning youre going to crash like thunder.""Read more about Ryan GoslingThe Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.Sign upMore from the Toronto Star amp; PartnersLOADING                                             LOADING                    25degCloseHomeLatest NewsVideoGTABlogsJims Restaurant about to serve its last best western in LeslievilleLeslieville diner closing to make way for condos.NewsGTACity HallQueens ParkCanadaWorldInvestigationsCrimeBusinessEconomyPersonal FinanceReal EstateYour TorontoSchoolsThe FixerLifeFashion amp; StyleFood amp; WineHealth amp; WellnessHomesParentTechnologyTravelSportsAmateurBaseballBasketballBlue JaysCurlingFootballGolfHockeyLacrosseLeafsOlympicsRaptorsSoccerTennisOpinionCommentaryCorrectionsEditorialsEditorial CartoonPublic EditorReaders LettersEntertainmentBooksMoviesMusicStageTelevisionVisual ArtsDiversionsHoroscopesCrosswordsSudokuComicsWheels.caSpecial FeaturesObituariesClassifiedsTV ListingsHot TopicsDem.

Photo Credit Handout advertisement | advertise on newsday REVIEW PLOT The actions of a petty criminal reverberate through several lives. Rated R (violence language drug use) BOTTOM LINE Terrific performances particularly from rising star DeHaan but the muddled narrative never gets its point across. Ultimately its a well-made head-scratcher. CAST Ryan Gosling Bradley Cooper Eva Mendes Dane DeHaan LENGTH 210 In ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" Ryan Gosling plays Handsome Luke a motorcycle stuntman with neck tattoos a butterfly knife and a pack of smokes in his waistband. Luke is another brute-of-few-words role for Gosling (""Drive"" ""Gangster Squad"") a new-millennium Steve McQueen whose pretty face and cruel blue eyes make a potent combination. And dont forget Goslings chiseled bod -- its this movies opening image. That promises a certain level of sex and violence and ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" initially delivers. In its first third Luke begins robbing banks to support the child he never knew he had (Eva Mendes plays the babys mama). This story is gritty and gripping but just as things get hot the narrative switches gears. Most popular Seth Meyers live Late Night funny effortless AGT star from LI set for shows quarterfinals Who will Fletcher choose on Bachelorette finale? 3 longtime Sesame Street stars leaving the show Late nights convention takes Who did it best? Now were focused on Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) a young cop navigating a web of politics and corruption. Cooper is quite convincing as a do-gooder slowly realizing he was born to do bad but this story also ends abruptly. Fifteen years later the teenage sons of Luke and Avery unwittingly meet with fateful results. This is daring storytelling from filmmaker Derek Cianfrance reteaming with Gosling after 2010s marvelous ""Blue Valentine"" though its the terrific cast that keeps you watching. The lesser-knowns are the best Ben Mendelsohn (""Killing Them Softly"") turns the minor role of Lukes only pal Robin into a major heart tugger; Emory Cohen plays Cross son with a slippery mix of rapper swagger and homoeroticism; Dane DeHaan as Lukes damaged dangerous offspring delivers the films most riveting performance. (Look for DeHaan as Harry Osborn in the next ""Spider-Man"" film.) For all that ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" simply doesnt hang together. Its three stories are so loosely connected its themes so scattered -- morality justice fate fatherhood -- that it never manages to make a point. For such a well-crafted and wonderfully acted film it ultimately elicits a shrug. PLOT The actions of a petty criminal reverberate through several lives.

(AP Photo/Focus Features Atsushi Nishijima) Atsushi Nishijima This film image released by Focus Features shows Ryan Gosling in ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" (AP Photo/Focus Features Atsushi Nishijima) Luke (Ryan Gosling) isnt exactly husband material. As a motorcycle stunt rider he doesnt have to worry about office politics getting promoted or avoiding layoffs. And as far as women are concerned Lukes simply out for a good time. That is until he discovers that one of his bedmates Romina (Eva Mendes) is the mother of a son he didnt know he had.In a world in which some cops arent worthy of the badge Avery (Bradley Cooper) takes pride in being incorruptible. Maybe its because hes a judges son and has too much respect for the law to allow it to be compromised. But in the aftermath of a fateful encounter with Luke Avery is forced to make a choice about just how far hes willing to go to uphold his principles.Years later Lukes son Jason (Dane DeHaan) and Averys son AJ (Emory Cohen) find themselves in the same high school and subject to the same vices. Their tentative friendship soon goes sour replaced by a relationship thats much darker and far more dangerous. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is an ambitious drama about the ways in which one bad decision can reverberate across generations. Director and co-writer Derek Cianfrance (""Blue Valentine"") clearly wants to make a grand statement about fathers sons and destiny -- and he largely succeeds. Its only in the last of its three sections that the film falters as what had been a taut tragedy degenerates into a limp melodrama. But the acting is first-rate. Gosling (who also starred in ""Blue Valentine"") masterfully fills in Lukes motivational blanks and Cooper nicely handles Averys evolution from idealist to manipulator.Their performances and Cianfrances flawed but fascinating vision are enough to make ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" an exciting destination.

At a sprawling 140 minutes the third feature from Blue Valentine director Derek Cianfrance feels like an entire Springsteen LP an intimate story of smalltown folk played in the soaring major key of epic multi-generational melodrama. The first act - side one if you like - is pure old-time rock n roll as Ryan Goslings born-to-run stunt rider Handsome Luke knocks up good time girl Eva Mendes and decides to do the right thing by staying in town. The second part is more stadium-friendly as Bradley Coopers wounded cop comes face to face with corruption in his department in the form of Ray Liottas bulldog precinct captain. Finally its time for some earnest introspection - get the acoustic guitars out - as both mens adolescent sons struggle to overcome their family demons. As with Blue Valentine writer-director Cianfrance opts for a naturalistic tone the colours are muted the camerawork unobtrusive and the dialogue straight and honest. His performers are mostly spot-on - as the tousled petrolhead with the faraway eyes Gosling gets by far the flashiest role (this is going to be a huge hit with the hey girl set) but hes superbly backed by Mendes and Ben Mendelsohn as a crotchety backwoods mechanic. Cooper is less compelling - much of that is down to his slippery less relatable character - but the only real bum note is struck by young Emory Cohen as his son AJ with his slicked-back hair and hey-yous-guys accent Cohen seems to be auditioning for a stage-school production of The Karate Kid. But that odd performance and a handful of minor pacing issues aside The Place Beyond the Pines is an enormously satisfying film carefully observed and consistently compelling it feels like an instant American classic if a minor one. Cianfrances conclusions may tend towards the obvious - crime doesnt pay cops can be crooks parents fuck you up - but theres nothing wrong with an old song so long as its well sung. Just ask The Boss.

I imagine many will have left as disappointed as I was at the film. In many ways I agree with Scrumpyjacks view. It starts well in places very well but after Act 1 goes downhill fast. The police corruption story is dull and has been done better before and the third act would have been better to have been left out. It is a 4 star opening act followed by a 3 then a 2 star final act. I expected more and was disappointed. A poor 3 star film could and should have been better.FlagShareHelpful?Yes|NoReplyApr 22 2013mscharlierFeaturedagree with scrumpy jacks comment I dont know why this film is getting such good reviews.

A number of own goals and missed opportunities - why the fifteen year gap? It felt that that story would have been far more interesting than anything that came before or after. No idea why Cianfrances considered such a talent his characters rarely have any kind of depth or redeeming feature; theres no emotional nuance nothing to latch on to and no one to care about. Grainy photography unsympathetic working class folk and the odd bit of casual violence do not a great director make. It feels like a posh kid playing at being working class. And if he is from the type of background that this film mostly depicts then he has the emotional intelligence of a clown fish. Actually that stand regardless of his background. On the plus side the guy that played Bradley Coopers dad was great though woefully under used. But AJ? What a truly baffling performance.

Theyre built for it. LoDo shooting leaves one dead another injured Peyton Manning stars in 3 new hilarious DIRECTV ads with Lionel Richie Woody Paige retiring from The Denver Post With the arrival of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" the American dramatic film has found a loyal gifted advocate in director Derek Cianfrance. The filmmaker behind 2010s pained marital drama ""Blue Valentine"" has re-teamed with one of that movies stars Ryan Gosling to tell the tale of two men united by a moment of violence and the consequences of that meeting for them and their sons. Gosling portrays Luke a rootless motorcycle stunt driver who tries to do right by doing wrong when he learns he has an infant son. As rookie cop Avery Cross Bradley Cooper follows up his Oscar-nominated ""Silver Linings Playbook"" performance with a role that pushes him even deeper into the demands of acting. Because ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (co-written by Cianfrance Ben Coccio and Darius Marder) is such a willfully built piece of storytelling some are likely to find it mannered. Startlingly classical is more like it. Yes the movie makes the unusual leap from one protagonist to another before 15 years hence introducing their moody adolescent sons in a Schenectady N.Y. high school. But chiefly ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" has a formal fondness for the tragically flawed. Years before those sons meet Luke has returned to Schenectady to work the traveling-carnival circuit. Were introduced to him as he toys with a knife flipping it open and closed the way a gunslinger might holster and un-holster a six-shooter. Hes tattooed. His hair is bleached. Theres a dagger with a drop of blood inked at the corner of this left eye. The stunt he and two others perform is loud wild three helmeted dudes zip arcing in a metal sphere using and abusing gravity to the roar of engines and crowd. Cianfrance is a sensual filmmaker aware not just of the moving lyrical image but of the richness of sound design and music. ""The movie is visually lush sonically verdant. When Romina (Eva Mendes) shows up at the carnival the sweet smirk of recognition on Lukes mouth suggests romance. Its heavier than that. Everything in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" comes with heft. When Luke learns he has a baby son he decides to stay. Even though Romina didnt tell him about Jason even though she has a new man Kofi (Mahershala Ali). Later after the film brings Avery and Luke face-to-face raised gun to raised gun well be introduced to Averys wife Jennifer played by Rose Byrne. They too have a baby son. If theres a blemish to ""The Place in the Pines"" it is in the way the screenplay disempowers two mothers who obviously care deeply about the welfare of their sons. There is a sense their best efforts cant temper the moody legacy of each boys father. After learning about his son Luke hooks up with the damaged canny Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) whos had some success (not evident from his rural property) robbing banks. Luke takes to heists the way he took to the sphere o death stunt. But if he could see down the road hed glimpse a fateful meeting with a young adrenaline-jittery cop. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" has three distinct acts. The second finds Coopers character receiving a heros treatment he doesnt feel he deserves after a lethal meeting with an outlaw. The son of a respected judge Avery opted out of law school to become a police officer. Only hes joined a department too comfortable with corruption. As soon as we hear the sharp report of actor Ray Liottas laugh we know what kind of cop Averys colleague Detective Deluca is. Avery faces his own set of ethical decisions with their own reverberations. In the final act Lukes mildly diffident son Jason (Dane DeHaan) meets Averys angry-young scion AJ (Emory Cohen). Not knowing each others family history they meet in that alienated illicit potent way teens sometime do. Granted this set-up defies Cianfrances more naturalistic tendencies. But then from its revving start to its aching conclusion ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" has tussled with the tension between the intimate and the epic between legacy and possibility.

Starring Ryan Gosling Bradley Cooper Dane DeHaan Rose Byrne Eva Mendes Bruce Greenwood Ray Liotta Ben Mendelsohn Harris Yulin Director Derek Cianfrance Running time 220 Release Opened Apr 5 2013  Editorial Review Hey girl its a vicious cycleBy Ann HornadayFriday April 5 2013""The Place Beyond the Pines"" Derek Cianfrances ambitious unwieldy multi-generational morality tale features Ryan Gosling in the kind of tattooed lover-boy role that might have been perfect for Robert Mitchum. Playing the same kind of taciturn smoking-hot loner that he embodied as the getaway man in ""Drive"" here Gosling plays a drifter named Luke who makes his living on the road as a motorcycle stunt rider. The movie begins with Cianfrances stealthily observant camera following Luke from behind as he psychs himself up for another bout in the spherical cage where he drives his bike in accelerating centrifugal loop-de-loops while the surrounding crowd cheers. For a minute there it looks like ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" will be a deeply psychological character study in the tradition of ""The Wrestler"" or ""The Fighter."" And with his alert sense of tone and atmosphere Cianfrance -- who directed Gosling in the searing relationship drama ""Blue Valentine"" -- clearly has the chops to deliver the kind of emotional deep-dive those movies offered. But here he goes for something more sprawling and self-consciously dramatic a meditation on fate destiny and sins of the fathers delivered as a three-act triptych that suffers from diminishing returns with each successive installment. But Cianfrance is too skilled a scenarist to make ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" anything less than compelling. Even when it devolves into schematic structural conceits and overwrought contrivance it exerts an undeniable aesthetic and psychic pull. During the films first act much of that force comes by way of Gosling who even with weirdly bleach-blond hair commands attention with every flick of his eyelashes. Luke has just performed at a fair in Schenectady N.Y. when hes paid a visit by Romina (Eva Mendes) a woman he met there a year earlier. Luke decides to hang around fetching up at a roadside mechanics shop run by a motorcycle enthusiast named Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). Fittingly enough for a movie about the rituals of men acting like men (which often looks like boys doing incredibly stupid stuff) the two meet at a wordless dirt-biking contest in the woods a sequence Cianfrance films with both bucolic lyricism and tense machismo. Even though Lukes subsequent actions are motivated by his devotion to Romina the real romance in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is between Luke and Robin Cianfrance shoots them in the high key light of lovers their blue eyes flashing toward each other amid the garages sooty grime. Lukes chapter of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" features the films best scenes including at least two impressive chases through the Schenectady streets and a cemetery. Soon thereafter Luke crosses paths with Avery (Bradley Cooper) a city police officer who in many ways resembles Lukes own shadow self. Laboring under the high expectations of a demanding father and within a corrupt police force Avery should present even more material for a good juicy narrative about moral uncertainty. But its during this chapter that ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" begins to wobble as characters act in increasingly improbable ways. The coincidences finally collide in a fatal pile-up in the third act which features the terrific Dane DeHaan and a woefully miscast Emory Cohen who mumbles his way unconvincingly through his characters wannabe-gangsta stylings. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is finally too labored too pat to be believable. But as he did with the more tightly focused and pungent ""Blue Valentine"" Cianfrance proves to be exceptionally skillful at coaxing galvanizing performances from his actors and at creating a world that seems both universal and hermetically self-contained. As the sum of some admittedly imperfect parts ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" still manages to cast its own haunting sorrowful spell.Contains profanity throughout some violence teen drug and alcohol use and a sexual reference.

David Brewster Star Tribune Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink Purchase Order Reprint ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" tells three overlapping stories that center on the legacies -- voluntary or not -- fathers leave their sons and the split-second decisions that can shape them. The title is the English translation of the Mohawk word for the films setting Schenectady. Its a fitting romanticizing of reality for the films characters who all hope for something better than what they have. As bottle-blond tat-splattered motorcycle stunt rider Luke Ryan Gosling has never been better. When he runs into former one-night stand Romina (his real-life love Eva Mendes) and finds out hes a babydaddy the ramblin man goes gooey at the prospect of having an insta-family. Never mind Rominas live-in boyfriend. Determined to support his toddler son Luke teams with a mechanic (the always-superb Ben Mendelsohn last seen as the junkie in ""Killing Them Softly"") to rob banks and his single-take getaway chase scene -- for which Gosling reportedly trained six hours a day for two months -- is a nail-biter. Director and co-writer Derek Cianfrance whose decaying-marriage tear-jerker ""Blue Valentine"" also starred Gosling has built a reputation as idealistic and uncompromising brilliant at creating mood amid an airtight structure. But where that film jumped back and forth in time this one is linear -- and thats about the only storytelling convention Cianfrance follows as he plays with narrative arc and alternates between bursts of high-octane action and the gritty foreboding yet dreamy feel of ""21 Grams."" The second story emerging before the first is quite over features Bradley Cooper as wounded-hero cop Avery. Facing corruption among his cohorts (including Ray Liotta). Avery has some serious ethical elasticity of his own. Cooper builds on his ""Silver Linings Playbook"" serious-actor cred with shifty nervous eyes conveying the self-doubt and fear he cant express verbally. Averys father (Harris Yulin) a judge who cant completely hide his disappointment in his sons blue-collar career path adds another generational element to the theme. Avery and his wife (Rose Byrne) also have a young boy. Jumping ahead the third and weakest story in the film intertwines the fates of the sons of the cop and the criminal when they reach their teens. Unfortunately the tail end of the triptych cant sustain the dramatic tension that came before it without toppling an already precarious believability. Still with so much to chew on it doesnt feel like that matters too much. With more than 50 speaking roles the film easily could have sprawled out of control into a predictable epic. But ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" holds enough intimacy -- and surprise -- to satisfy.

"Movie review The Place Beyond the Pines Gosling is reason enough to venture Beyond the PinesCops and robbers sons - Movies - Boston.com Sites V ^ Boston.com BDCwire Love Letters Real Estate Menu Login Search Search Home News Weather Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Travel Cars Real Estate Cops and robbers legacy in The Place Beyond the Pines Share Tweet Bcom - Article MobileFriendly - Methode Share Tweet By Ty Burr Globe Staff | 04.04.13 | 314 PM Ryan Gosling is a sight in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" and not for the usual reasons. His hairs cropped short and dyed platinum blond. Awkward hand-scratched tattoos crawl along his chest and up his neck; you wonder what will happen when they reach his brain. The actors steady stare has a desperate edge to it as though the Driver from ""Drive"" had misplaced his Zen. Goslings character a fairground stunt-cyclist named Luke anchors the first third of ""Pines"" the new feature from ""Blue Valentine"" director Derek Cianfrance. That 2010 drama about the dissolution of a marriage announced an up-and-coming filmmakers talent for getting under the skins of inarticulate characters using a cinematic style of bruised colors brooding soundtrack choices and restless camera moves. It was an ambitious film that at its intermittent best felt entirely organic and real. Related Link Find showtimes and theaters Cianfrances ambitions are much more in evidence this time out. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is a triptych three successive story lines about Luke a young cop named Avery (Bradley Cooper) and -- 15 years later -- their respective teenage sons Jason (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen). Its very much a film about men their yearnings and discontents and about the way sins tumble down from one generation to the next. Its a bank-robber movie too as well as a drama about the pressures teenagers face from parents and peers. You can feel Cianfrance biting off more and more until his mouth is too full to chew. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Of the three chapters the first is easily the least forced. With minimal dialogue and maximum visual style ""Pines"" hovers behind Luke as he moves through his world gracefully on a motorcycle and unsteadily on foot. Hes a young carny who rides in circles inside a metal ball; there are two other riders but Lukes the star of the show. Passing through Schenectady N.Y. on the circuss annual circuit he learns that Romina (Eva Mendes) a local beauty he seduced the previous year has borne him a son. This news is a revelation Always rootless Luke is suddenly possessed with the desire to remain in one place. Problem Romina has a steady boyfriend (Mahershala Ali) a do-right sort whos raising the child. Luke buzzes in wobbly circles around them falling in with a garage mechanic (a movingly tender Ben Mendelsohn) with bad ideas about raising quick cash. The robbery scenes are ugly and violent graceless disasters that prove how hapless Luke is when hes not in a cage. Goslings eerie charisma -- the way he can convey a stillness at the center of chaos -- gives the first third of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" a sense of both rapture and tragedy but the film becomes more programmatic and problematic when it moves on to the second story line involving Coopers naive policeman. Averys a rich kid a law school graduate whos pounding a beat because he believes thats where the real people live. What he learns about his fellow cops probably wont surprise you -- especially when I tell you Ray Liottas involved -- but you can feel Cianfrances uncertainty when the genre conventions kick in. Hes an intuitive filmmaker who seems to work best against plot structure rather than with it. Sadly ""Pines"" becomes more hemmed in by plot as it goes. Cianfrance and co-writers Ben Coccio and Darius Marder apparently went through 37 drafts before they were done and you believe it The final third feels like the work of talented men trying too hard to erase their footsteps. It hardly helps that Cohen as the thuggishly entitled son of Coopers policeman (now a crusading DA running for state attorney general) gives an obnoxious baby-Brando performance -- one of those acting jobs where you cant figure out whether youre irritated at the character or at the actor. Nor does Mendess halfhearted old-age makeup convince especially since Cooper only seems to have had a haircut in the intervening decade and a half. Even more damaging is the soundtrack by Faith No More bandleader Mike Patton a doomy collection of synthesized sighs and scrapes that makes the movie sound much chintzier than it actually is. But DeHaan gives a fine performance racked and sensitive as Lukes son and its in him that Cianfrances themes of sin and forgiveness most clearly find purchase. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is great to look at (Sean Bobbitt shot it) and the scenes with Gosling burn with a loss too powerful for words. Maybe thats the problem. Cianfrance hasnt figured out what he wants to say but he spends a lot of time and energy trying to say it. Ty Burr can be reached at tburrglobe.com.

RELATED NEWS Qamp;A Director Derek Cianfrance 10 motorcycle movies Wild One to Tron By Bill Goodykoontz The Republic | azcentral.com Thu Apr 4 2013 1011 AM ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is nothing if not ambitious a tale of loss and bad decisions told in three parts that director Derek Cianfrance wants so strongly to be epic that by the end youll most likely submit. Fine fine its an epic. Now let us up for air please. This is not to diminish its considerable strengths. (Well OK maybe it is just a little.) Chief among them is the performance of Ryan Gosling. Bradley Coopers good too. But the risk of telling three distinct-but-related stories is that all may not be of equal quality. Thats the case here as the movie starts strong but gets progressively weaker particularly in the third act when coincidence story decisions and ultimately exhaustion overwhelm. Say this for Cianfrance though If ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is not the classic cinematic achievement he so obviously wants it to be its not for lack of trying. (Ironically his last feature ""Blue Valentine"" which also starred Gosling and told the tale of a dying marriage was smaller in scope but more impactful.) The movie begins with a buff shirtless tattooed Gosling standing and smoking. This guy named Luke is obviously trouble. Intriguing trouble but trouble just the same. The camera in a long unbroken shot follows him as he dresses and walks through a depressing carnival midway in Schenectady N.Y. whose Mohawk name gives the film its title. Eventually he gets on a motorcycle and follows other riders into one of those insane cages where they whiz past one another at high speeds. After the show a woman named Romina (Eva Mendes) approaches Luke and asks if he remembers her from the last time the show was in town. He does. But its more than a memory test from a one-night stand. She tells him that in the year since she last saw him shes given birth to his son. Instead of bailing on her Luke quits the show and tells Romina he will provide for her and her son. She doesnt want him to; she has what appears to be a stable life with a boyfriend Kofi (Mahershala Ali). But Luke is determined. He finds a job helping a mechanic named Robin (Ben Mendelsohn excellent) who mentions that back in the day he used to rob the occasional bank for extra money. With Lukes motorcycle skills well. ... ""Your skill set?"" Robin muses. ""Very unique."" Indeed. Cianfrance cranks up the tension during the robberies and the getaways. Films are funny that way. Theyre one place you dont want the bank robber to be caught. And Luke is good at it. He feels like things are going OK but its fools gold; even a burned-out case like Robin can see that. Eventually Luke has an encounter with a rookie policeman named Avery (Cooper) and the story shifts to the latter man. Avery too makes bad choices although under far different circumstances. His father is a judge and hes a law-school graduate but Avery wants to help where its needed most or so he says. Aided by fate scheming and sheer audacity his ambition proves astonishing. The third segment set 15 years later finds the sins of the fathers visited upon the sons. At least thats the idea. AJ (Emory Cohen) Averys son is an underachieving mess while Lukes son Jason (Dane DeHaan) is even more adrift. AJ transfers to Jasons school they meet (though unaware of each others father) they skip school and get high. Trouble ensues. Its hard to get past the randomness of their meeting. Yes Cianfrance is trying to make a point. But if the first two segments werent exactly subtle here he beats us over the head with the plot mallet. A lighter touch would have worked better. (The occasional inclusion of even a little bit of levity in a movie lasting two hours and 20 minutes wouldnt hurt either.) But if youve got the endurance Gosling and Cooper hold the screen as potentially good men whose choices doom them no matter how long it takes to play out. Too long in this film which has much to admire but less to enjoy. Reach Goodykoontz at bill.goodykoontzarizonarepublic.com. Facebook facebook.com/GoodyOnFilm.

"Place Beyond the Pines movie review - Chicago Tribune Movies Arts amp; Entertainment Movies A Place Beyond the Pines where two actors shine  1/2 The Place Beyond the Pines Ryan Gosling stars in ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" Ryan Gosling stars in ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" Michael PhillipsContact ReporterChicago Tribune In director Derek Cianfrances previous feature ""Blue Valentine"" pretension found itself in a stern deadlock with dramatic honesty. Thanks to the performance of Michelle Williams opposite the flashier more contrived flourishes of Ryan Gosling the results were worth seeing.Now however Cianfrance has stepped up with ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" a more sprawling and ambitiously structured story again co-starring Gosling. It is a better more fully felt and moving picture than ""Blue Valentine."" Gosling and co-star Bradley Cooper have stepped up as well finding the value in interacting as well as the quiet isolation of men in crisis. The reviews have been a little sniffy thus far as the film has traveled from the festival circuit into limited theatrical release. The best course of action is to see it then figure out what does or doesnt work for you in its tales of sons fathers moral compromise and the harsh beautiful business of living.Describe some of co-writer and director Cianfrances narrative details and ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" like its title sounds a tad grandiose. Gosling plays Luke a motorcycle stunt performer traveling with a two-bit carnival. Coming through Schenectady N.Y. on his annual tour he learns he has fathered a son with a local waitress (Eva Mendes) now living with a man (Mahershala Ali) who doesnt like Luke sniffling around. Pulling a page from the Billy Bigelow ""Carousel"" playbook Luke turns to bank robbery at the behest of his pal Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). It goes well for a while. Lukes ardent attempts to establish something like a familial connection with his infant son complicate the audiences relationship to the films protagonist. And then for reasons Ill leave you to discover the focus shifts to a police officer played by Cooper whose life changes forever the day he becomes the hero (the word haunts him the rest of the film) who pursued the ""moto-bandit.""I love how ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" hands off from the criminal to the law enforcement officer. I love also how in a daring ""15 years later"" leap forward it becomes a story of the male teenage offspring of the troubled men played by Gosling and Cooper. Theres an encompassing sense of destiny guiding the events of Cianfrances movie but the people in it really do seem like people not pieces of plot.Separately the components of ""Pines"" are familiar Ray Liotta among others plays a dirty cop for example and nothing in a sentence containing ""Ray Liotta"" and ""dirty cop"" could possibly surprise anyone. But the script co-written by Cianfrance Ben Coccio and Darius Marder gives both male and female halves of the on-screen relationships their due as flawed intriguingly knotty members of the same species.Its final third putters a bit. 140 minutes doesnt feel indulgent exactly just occasionally slack. But its not enough to lessen the achievement. Sean Bobbitts cinematography refuses to glamorize these people or the places they inhabit; in the same vein editors Jim Helton and Ron Patane and composer Mike Patton keep the momentum flowing subtly. You watch what happens often dreading the worst. Even when the worst comes though it comes with honor and a kind of grace. mjphillipstribune.comThe Place Beyond the Pines -- 3 1/2 starsMPAA rating R (for language throughout some violence teen drug and alcohol use and a sexual reference)Running time 220Opens Friday Copyright (c) 2016 Chicago Tribune Entertainment Movies The Place Beyond the Pines (movie) Ray Liotta Blue Valentine (movie) Bradley Cooper Ben Mendelsohn Best movies of 2012 Top 50 superhero movies of the last 10 years Lolla 2016SportsBreakingTrendingOpinionBusinessSuburbsAdvertising77deg","http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-0402-place-beyond-pines-20130404,0,1489951.column",200,theplacebeyondthepines14,theplacebeyondthepines,chicagotribune

The directors latest effort ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" contains a far more ambitious structure that covers four overlapping character arcs over the course of 15 years. That the movie succeeds both as a high-stakes crime thriller as well as a far quieter and empathetic study of angry solitary men proves that Cianfrance has a penchant for bold storytelling and an eye for performances to carry it through. With ""Pines"" the gamble pays off. At first the movie revolves around the travails of Luke (Ryan Gosling) a tattooed stunt bike rider living on the edge in Schenectady New York. In an early scene former lover Romina (Eva Mendes) surfaces to let Luke know he has an infant son. Given something to care about Luke plunges into a dead-end gig before taking the suggestion of his only close friend Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) and robbing banks. While his acquaintance suggests restricting the robberies to avoid getting capture some combination of hubris and adrenaline addiction drives Luke to keep at it until the police finally catch up to him. Around the one-hour mark Cianfrance shifts this nimble heist move into action mode as cops engage in a high-speed pursuit of Luke through numerous backroads until hes finally cornered. Lukes sudden fate arrives like a breach in the movies initially familiar trajectory; in the wake of that development the action shifts to the experiences of one of the aforementioned lawmen. That would be Avery (Bradley Cooper) an earnest police officer with a newborn child of his own. While hailed as a hero  Avery faces the fretful gaze of his wife (Rose Byrne) and inwardly copes with the impact he has had on the life of Lukes child. Drawing out his insecurities Avery faces the machinations of a corrupt fellow officer (Ray Liotta naturally) which complicates his capacity to justify his behavior. If hes not working for the good guys then where should his sympathies lie? After a failed attempt to make amends with Lukes ex-lover Avery sinks into his private troubles. With dialogue thats less analytical than implicative Cianfrance leaves much to the subtleties of the plot to his cast. Its no surprise that Gosling delivers a tough moody role thats still riddled with pathos. Cooper however has never been better conveying the depth of solitude his character experiences through heretofore untapped restraint. Nevertheless there are times when ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" threatens to become too mopey and self-serious for its own good. The final act finds the director upping the ante one final time with a connection that at first seems too pat Fifteen years after the earlier events the teen offspring of the two men from earlier in the movie meet at the local high school and form a peculiar bond. But once again performances come into play Emory Cohen is fine as AJ Averys thuggish son but Dane DeHaan delivers a particularly nuanced snapshot of youth alienation as Jason a young man who has grown up only vaguely aware of his fathers misdeeds. For Jason coming to terms with the shadow cast by those crimes means reckoning with the past while trying to reconcile it with his own burgeoning moral compass. The themes are weighty but Cianfrances use of handheld camerawork and gradual pace result in a disquieting style that smartly underplays the drama even as tension slowly builds. The crime and police genres used to give ""Pines"" its forward motion are rarely seen with such a remarkable degree of sensitivity. While the similar atmosphere in ""Blue Valentine"" fit the setting like a glove the dissonance of events and feeling in ""Pines"" is exactly what makes it such a fascinating curiosity. The movie finds the gentler struggles beneath lifes uglier moments. ""If you ride like lightening youll crash like thunder"" Lukes friend Robin tells him. Thats the essence of ""Pines."" Criticwire grade A- HOW WILL IT PLAY? A big hit at TIFF immediately after its premiere ""Pines"" should be able to find a home with a midsize distributor and perform well with an older arthouse crowd.

The picture disintegrates into a heavy handed cliched mess. It starts off great but begins to fall apart about 45 minutes of the way in and becomes increasingly preposterous from that point on. The second and third acts are so problematic that they spoil what could have been a solid film. Cianfrances ambitions get the worst of him here though there are again signs of a director with ability. A C grade is more like it. This critic is also clueless when noting who he thinks the film will play to. An older arthouse crowd for this picture is not going to happen.

"Review In The Place Beyond the Pines society is the bad guy - latimes Advertisement YOU ARE HERE LAT Home-Collections-Movies_nowReview In The Place Beyond the Pines society is the bad guyHaves and have-nots are on a collision course in Derek Cianfrances latest. Its a social meditation torn by violence but lighted by hope.March 28 2013|By Betsy Sharkey Los Angeles Times Film Critic Eva Mendes and Bradley Cooper star in ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" (Atsushi Nishijima / Focus...)Violence is the trigger in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" Derek Cianfrances latest love letter to bad breaks. But its the ripple effect of responsibility regret limited resources and guilt that makes ""Pines"" particularly relevant in a time when so many struggle from paycheck to paycheck.Starring Ryan Gosling Eva Mendes Bradley Cooper Ray Liotta and Dane DeHaan the movie is intimate in its telling sweeping in its issues and stumbles only occasionally.The idiosyncratic Cianfrance tends to gravitate toward the economically challenged who live lives of desperation. Its a cultural slice that seems as forgotten by cinema as by society those carrying a deep longing for the American dream of home and family and a deep resentment that it is out of reach.PHOTOS Movies Sneaks 2013Ambition a either too much or too little of it a shadows the writer-directors work too.Those themes certainly drive ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" down some extremely rough roads and make it a logical follow-up to Cianfrances critically acclaimed ""Blue Valentine."" The 2010 film about the implosion of a marriage undone by a class divide and money woes earned Michelle Williams an Oscar nomination for her young mother with med-school dreams and featured Gosling in a standout performance as the high-school dropout shes grown beyond.This time it is fathers and sons and their tortured bonds that are examined.Instead of the serenity and contentment suggested by the title Cianfrance has created a troubling trilogy on the legacy of one brutal encounter that cuts a destructive path through multiple lives.The first of ""Pines"" three stories is Lukes (Gosling). Cianfrance carefully stacks the deck against the motorcycle stunt rider and ultimately everyone else in turn. Hair bleached nearly white Luke is a sinewy tattooed daredevil whose cage-riding thrills are the main attraction in a traveling carnival.Romina (Mendes) a lean beauty with bruised eyes and a perpetual pout shows up one night and life shifts. It takes a while to find that their hook-up the last time he was in town produced a son.Trouble comes when Luke decides he wants to become a good father to tiny Jason. But that will require insinuating himself into Rominas already settled life which includes better husband prospects in Kofi (Mahershala Ali).Luke needs help and Robin portrayed by the excellently scruffed-up Ben Mendelsohn becomes his bailout. Robin whose cigarettes hang so precariously they seem to defy gravity is a fan of Lukes a admiring the risk-taker he wishes he was.Robin is also a mechanic running an off-the-books shop out of a garage as rundown as he is. But it gives Luke a job and a place to crash a until his new pal floats a get-rich-quick scheme that involves robbing banks.It doesnt take long for Luke to cross paths with the law in this case a street cop named Avery (Cooper). Their face-off goes badly and the film shifts to Averys story the hometown hero who saved the day. That day will trouble Avery for a lifetime. His own fortunes turn on it.PHOTOS Hollywood backlot momentsAverys got his own temptations dangled by Deluca (Liotta) a dirty detective and others by his father (Harris Yulin) a judge who offers help in the way of dissatisfied fathers seeing only their sons failings.On one level Averys and Lukes lives arent so different a both have young sons whose mothers they love both have a string of people theyve disappointed. It is opportunity wealth and education a external factors a that divide them an irony to which the film keeps circling back.The third chapter picks up 15 years later. Averys son AJ (Emory Cohen) has grown into a privileged kid primed to go bad. Lukes boy Jason (DeHaan) is living with a now worn-down mom and stepdad Kofi on the economic margins. When it comes to Jasons future unlike AJ there are no great expectations. But like their fathers before them their paths will cross in complicated and life-altering ways.Cianfrance has a knack for picking the right moments to opt for understatement when the situation gets extreme. Mendes DeHaan and Gosling in particular are good at not overplaying their hands. The easy smile the wary eyes the sense of danger with which Gosling infuses Luke makes him a more interesting lowlife that he would otherwise be. Cooper coming off an Oscar nod for his unbalanced guy in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" pushes Averys angst a little too hard but its not enough to ruin the meditative mood.The grit is reflected in the details a a yard enveloped in weeds mutts underfoot rusted hinges metal security doors versus designer suits manicured lawns pristine pools a all the small ways circumstance overtakes lives. Sean Bobbitt who collaborated with director Steve McQueen on another dark story 2011s ""Shame"" and the coming ""Twelve Years a Slave"" served as director of photography.With the rough edges of its sprawling tale sometimes exposed ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" never quite reaches the refinement of ""Blue Valentine."" But it does give us the sort of down-market lives we too rarely see and a kind of heartbreak that is rarer still a moving evocative and even a little hopeful.betsy.sharkeylatimes.com---------------------------------The Place Beyond the PinesMPAA rating R for language throughout some violence teen drug and alcohol use and a sexual referenceRunning time 2 hours 20 minutesPlaying At the ArcLight Hollywood; Landmark Theatre West Los Angeles PHOTOS AND MORE TIMELINE Violence in movies ENVELOPE The latest awards buzz PHOTOS Greatest box office flops MORESeizure Led to FloJos DeathHis 104 scores make his caseRestaurant review South Beverly GrillBrutal Murder by Teen-Age Girls Adds to Britons ShockComaneci Confirms Suicide Attempt Magazine SaysAdvertisement FROM THE ARCHIVESRyan Gosling in The Place Beyond the Pines The eyes have...April 4 2013Ryan Goslings Place Beyond the Pines dominates specialty...March 31 2013For Pines director Cianfrance the waiting is the easiest...September 16 2012Focus Features to go to Place Beyond the PinesSeptember 9 2012Toronto 2012 Ryan Gosling plays a robber is greeted like...September 7 2012MORE STORIES ABOUTMovies_nowNot_live_webEntertainment_not_live_webCopyright 2016 Los Angeles TimesTerms of Service|Privacy Policy|Index by Date|Index by Keyword","http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-place-beyond-pines-20130329,0,5202442.story",200,theplacebeyondthepines18,theplacebeyondthepines,latimes

A cop on patrol turns left instead of right. The new kid in the high school cafeteria takes an open seat and starts talking to the boy across the table. Simple choices. Innocent choices. And yet in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" they will ripple out over years and result in ugly words and unexpected generosity sex and violence birth and death. If we knew -- really knew -- the consequences of our actions we would probably never move an inch. And yet the characters of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" are in constant different motion. Theres Luke a biker whos going nowhere in life but is constantly riding in circles as the star of a flashy carnival. Theres Avery the Schenectady beat cop who has big dreams of moving up and on but still glumly patrols the same narrow streets. They are men with responsibilities that root them -- debt tradition women. They are men with dreams that drive them - mostly their worry of what theyll leave their sons. They are two different people caught in similar constant tensions of opposing forces. Forces that will briefly bring them together -- and then quickly tear both of them apart. ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is the work of Derek Cianfrance the fantastically talented director of the morose ""Blue Valentine"" and it shares some things with that film besides the charismatic Ryan Gosling -- an uncomfortable small-town realism an interest in masculine psychology and a willingness to take big narrative gambles. Stylish and assured it hooks us from the start beginning with a dazzling travelling shot (like many directors Cianfrance probably thinks hes imitating Scorsese and ""Goodfellas""; what hes really imitating is Scorsese imitating not just ""Touch of Evil"" but ""I Am Cuba""). There will be other striking images too. But mostly it just lets its sad three-part story unfold slowly calmly and carefully. Because one thing leads to another as we begin with Goslings Luke and Eva Mendes the smoky-eyed waitress who gets him to settle down. Domesticity costs money however -- and having no other skill but being able to move really really fast Luke becomes a bank robber. That brings the police -- particularly Avery a not very impressive cop played by Bradley Cooper in a bad haircut and with a wad of gum in his mouth. Hes nobodys idea of a hero (certainly not veteran Ray Liotta who in another Scorsese nod shows up too). But Avery has ideas of getting ahead and Luke begins to figure in them. Cooper is good as the ambitious Avery but its Gosling you cant take your eyes off. His body a toned art gallery of tattoos the drop of blood inked near his eye standing for all the emotions he cant unleash hes a pale blond icon and immediately understandable as someone whose pulpy image and powerful influence reaches across generations. The unexpected way his story and Averys connect is the first big gamble of the screenplay (which Cianfrance wrote with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder). How that connection plays out is the second all-in bet as we suddenly skip ahead 15 years to see how events are now refracted through the mens two very different teenage sons. The leaps of faith required by this sort of storytelling wont be taken by all audiences; ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is for all its hip touches a genuine melodrama a genre that relies on scale -- big characters big emotions and yes big coincidences. Its built on large gestures and they can seem oversized in an arthouse and to modern moviegoers. Yet its ambitions -- even its unrealized ones -- are a great part of its power. Perhaps ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is too big for its own good (really there are three features here all crammed into 140 minutes). Perhaps as an artist Cianfrance cant yet grasp all that hes reaching for. But like Luke hes still daring to grab for it. Ratings note The film contains violence strong language sexual situations and drug and alcohol abuse. The Place Beyond the Pines (R) Focus (140 min.) Directed by Derek Cianfrance.

Subscribe Sign InSubscribe Review The Place Beyond the Pines Three-Part Disharmony A soulful Ryan Gosling binds together this flawed but ultimately moving triptych about fathers and sons By Mary Pols MaryPolsMarch 28 2013 Share Read Later Send to Kindle Atsushi Nishijima/Focus Features Email Print Share FacebookTwitterTumblrLinkedInStumbleUponRedditDiggMixxDeliciousGoogle+ Follow TIMECulture The movie-star business is such that Id been thinking of The Place Beyond the Pines as Ryan Goslings movie one in which he reteams with his Blue Valentine director Derek Cianfrance. I was wrong. Though Gosling appearing in only the first third of the film sparks the story into motion The Place Beyond the Pines cant be said to be anyones movie but Cianfrances. Structured as a triptych the movie is novelistic earnest and somewhat exhausting -- an ambitious effort that tries to be many things. And it is definitely something a sprawling engaging study in fathers sons and sins. Gosling is Luke who has a job in a traveling carnival riding a motorcycle in a round metal cage with two other cyclists. The movie opens with Luke entering a shabby tent mounting the bike and climbing into his peculiar torture-chamber-like workspace -- which may be Cianfrances statement that were all captive going round and round on a carousel of time. When Luke discovers that Romina the waitress he slept with during last years swing through upstate New York has borne him a child named Jason he climbs off that carousel and attempts to be a father. ""My father wasnt around and look what happened to me"" he tells Romina (played by a winningly vulnerable Eva Mendes). (MORE Wait Ryan Gosling Is Doing What?) At first this means loitering around the apartment she shares with the baby her mother and Kofi (Mahershala Ali of Treme) whom Romina calls her ""man."" Kofi has provided her with a home and accepted the child as his own -- hes the true prince of this drama. While Kofi is providing for Jason Luke meets up with a mechanic named Robin (the fantastic Ben Mendelsohn from Killing Them Softly) who quickly develops a boy-crush on Luke. After helping him with a minimum-wage job and a free room Robin hatches a bad idea involving them becoming bank robbers. ""Not since Hall and Oates has there been such a team"" Luke says to Robin in the adrenaline rush that follows their first heist before they dissolve into giggles and start slapping at each other like teenagers. Id watch an entire television series about these guys (or even one just featuring Robin hanging around in his little rural garage). Theyre dopes but heartbreakingly so. Theres an abrupt shift in perspective to that of a rookie cop named Avery (Bradley Cooper proving Silver Linings Playbook was not a fluke). Suddenly leaving Lukes story is a robbery of sorts; I wasnt done with him. Theres little to admire in Avery who is aggressive in matters pertaining to career and cowardly in almost everything else. Hes got a law degree but is dabbling in blue collar work which seems like a pose. The commonality is that hes as nervous and uncertain about doing the right thing as Luke is about doing the wrong thing. And just like Luke Avery has an infant son AJ although he is far less interested in his boy. Visually Cianfrance and cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (Shame) do some of the same irritating camera work (not just wobbling but a wavering multiple-exposure effect that hurts the eyes) in the first two parts of the triptych but the texture of the film changes. So many supporting characters fill the story -- a corrupt cop (Ray Liotta) a woman who is fearful that she has married an entire police department (Rose Byrne) a slightly slimy district attorney (Bruce Greenwood) Averys father a weary former state supreme court justice (Harris Yulin) -- that at times it seems like a seedy small-town Goodfellas. In Blue Valentine Cianfrance deliberately fractured the temporal narrative to tease out the telling moments in a doomed relationship; his primary storytelling goal seemed to be seeking and revealing intimacies. The Place Beyond the Pines is more strictly linear and less about intimacies than outcomes. What sins of a father will be visited upon a son? Are they avoidable? Yet I was taken aback when Cianfrance launched into a third act ""15 Years Later"" involving the children of the two main characters. Its an unnecessary appendage; we already have a good idea of the fates that await Jason (played as a teen by Leonardo DiCaprio look-alike Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen from Smash). (MORE TIMEs Review of Blue Valentine) This last chapter lacks the jagged energy of the previous two -- and some might even fault Cianfrance for indulgently allowing his movie to run 140 minutes. At first I wasnt convinced I needed to sit through it just as I wasnt convinced by the dusting of gray in Mendes hair. And yet I was ultimately moved by this last act. Thats a credit to the director for steering his film onward when most everyone else would have called it a day. And maybe also a credit to Gosling who makes such a strong impression in his short time onscreen that in a sense the rest of the movie particularly the last act becomes a testimonial to his character.

A stunt rider (Ryan Gosling) starts robbing banks to provide for his lover (Eva Mendes) which puts him on a collision course with a detective (Bradley Cooper). (Photo/Video Focus Features) By Joe Morgenstern Joe Morgenstern The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyJoe Morgenstern JoeMorgenstern Joe.Morgensternwsj.com March 28 2013 627 p.m. ET One-third wonderful ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" weakens as it unfolds for lack of what makes the early part so good. The film structured as three sequential episodes with a common theme was directed by Derek Cianfrance and stars Ryan Gosling Bradley Cooper and Eva Mendes. Mr. Gosling was superb as the explosive lover in the directors previous film ""Blue Valentine"" and hes superb once again as Luke a stunt motorcyclist with a traveling carnival who discovers that he has a baby son. This hero with a divided soul--a Gosling specialty--is such a powerful presence that his influence is felt even when hes off screen. Thats the intended consequence of the story which concerns the fates bequeathed by fathers to their sons. Still Luke is off screen much more than hes on a situation whose unintended consequence is an energy sink in an overlong drama that grows ever more mundane. Everything turns on Luke as the film begins; watching him is like watching a gathering storm. Some of the attraction flows from the actors appearance--bleached blond hair bemuscled body covered with tattoos. Mainly though we watch intently because a startlingly spare performance has been coupled with smart pared-back writing. (The script was written by Mr. Cianfrance Ben Coccio and Darius Marder.) Luke speaks softly guardedly when Romina a former lover played affectingly by Ms. Mendes appears out of nowhere during the carnivals tour of upstate New York. ""Do you remember my name?"" she asks scanning his face for any sign of emotion. Far from having forgotten her hes drawn to her then stunned to learn she has given birth to his child. Stunned briefly but decisively. In a flash Luke commits to fatherhood just as he decides in a subsequent flash to provide for his son--shades of ""My boy Bill"" the carnival barkers soliloquy in ""Carousel""--by robbing banks with a newfound buddy named Robin ( Ben Mendelsohn shrewdly memorable in a minor role). These are existential decisions made by a prisoner of the moment whose longtime M.O. has been feeling things through instead of thinking about them. Theyre decisions that need no explanation and theyre all the more exciting to watch because they arent explained. For better and worse this flawed but touching hero is a man of action revealing himself through what he does rather what he says. If only such thematic and dramatic economy governed the films latter part which tracks the impact of Lukes deeds on the lives of many others including his son. In the middle panel of the movies triptych Mr. Cooper plays Avery Cross another kind of hero--at least hes hailed as such for while--who loses his way and all sense of his true self after a brief morally ambiguous intersection with Luke. Theres a sense that the filmmakers heart is in this part of the story which uses Averys rise from rookie cop to district attorney to examine the nature of heroism the temptations of power and the determinist fate that sets two sons--Lukes and Averys--on a collision course. This would seem to be serious stuff and Mr. Cooper makes his scheming character as interesting as the writing allows. (The young actor cast as Averys teenage son plays him as a witless though almost surely unwitting parody of the young Marlon Brando; its a disastrous performance.) For the most part though this is self-serious stuff seething with ambition but almost devoid of spontaneity and ultimately drained of genuine energy. By the time the generational circle closes emotion has given way to exhaustion. ENLARGE Tashiana Washington and Ty Hickson Sundance Selects Gimme the Loot Sometimes principles can be a problem. I try to know as little as possible about movies before I see them so I can actually see them unclouded by bias or buzz. All I knew about ""Gimme the Loot"" was the running time 81 minutes and for the first 20 minutes I didnt think I could stick it out. What passes for a plot is more of a notion two young taggers from the Bronx Sofia and Malcolm drift cluelessly through the citys summer heat as they try to raise 500 in hopes of pulling off the ultimate triumph of New York tagging--covering the Mets home-run apple with graffiti. Little by little though the cluelessness grew endearing the cross-purpose conversations intricately funny the gritty look appealing. Watch a clip from the film ""Gimme the Loot."" When their latest work is buffed by a rival crew two graffiti writers embark on an elaborate plan to bomb the ultimate location the New York Mets Home Run Apple. (Photo/Video Sundance Selects) Adam Leons debut feature as it turns out had already won prizes and praise at several festivals. Should I have known that in advance? Maybe so but I didnt and Im glad given the pleasure of discovery. Tashiana Washington and Ty Hickson are terrific in the main roles. So is Zoe Lescaze as Ginnie a spoiled white kid who teaches the taggers a thing or two about drift and being dissolute. What Sofia and Malcolm dont know is amazing--they cant keep track of what floor theyre on in the course of a robbery he seems unaware that the flowers he casually stole for his mothers birthday need to be in water. Yet you find yourself rooting for them all the same--not for their success as taggers or petty thieves but for their flowering in a foreseeable future. ENLARGE Michel Bouquet Samuel Goldwyn Films Renoir If ""Renoir"" werent gorgeous to behold all would be lost from the start. Happily however this modestly scaled feature by Gilles Bourdos was shot by Mark Ping Bing Lee the Taiwan-born cinematographer who served as one of the shooters on the peerlessly beautiful ""In the Mood For Love."" Nothing is lost and much is gained from a luminous sense of place along with an intriguingly paradoxical though underdramatized portrait of the Impressionist master as a maker of beloved art who had little or no love to give those who loved him for himself. Heres Pierre-Auguste Renoir in 1915 near the end of his life--hes played by the splendid Michel Bouquet--still turning out paintings of undiminished beauty in the sublime Riviera setting of Cagnes-sur-Mer even though his hands are crippled by disease and hes often in pain. (The hand wielding the brush in closeups is that of a celebrated or notorious art forger Guy Ribes.) Heres Andree Heuschling an exquisite young woman newly come to model for Renoir; shes played extremely well given the limits of the writing and direction by Christa Theret. And here almost eerily is the old mans middle son Jean ( Vincent Rottiers). Back from the war with an injured leg young Jean Renoir is enchanted by Andree who will become his first wife and is guided by her faith in the talent that will make him one of the greatest film directors--one might argue the greatest director--of all time. ""Renoir"" is so beautiful and so intelligently conceived that you keep waiting in vain for a bit of fire to break out in the narrative. Its easy to be thankful though for vivid favors the details of Renoirs home which like the apartment in ""Amour"" speak volumes about those who live there; the sparkling light from a garden hose in an apple orchard; the bright light behind Andrees auburn hair; the warm light on her lovely breasts; the light radiating or so it seems from her crimson dress. Directors of photography used to be called lighting cameramen. This movie shows why. ENLARGE Jonathan Pryce Luke Bracey and Ray Stevenson Paramount Pictures G.I. Joe Retaliation Watch a clip from the film ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" The G.I. Joes are not only fighting their mortal enemy Cobra; they are forced to contend with threats from within the government that jeopardize their very existence. (Photo/Video Paramount) Id like to think Im still a kid at heart but when I was a real kid I played with Lionel trains not Hasbro HAS 0.30 % action figures so I wont pretend that I had a great time watching ""G.I. Joe Retaliation."" All the same it was good to find out that a few G.I. Joes could save the world from the vile U.S. president whod ordered all of them to be exterminated; that the vile president played by Jonathan Pryce wasnt who he seemed to be (i.e. a psychopathic monster playing Angry Birds on his cell phone while launching a nuclear strike); that thousands of nuclear missiles could self-destruct in flight without harm to the planet; that an even deadlier weapons system called Zeus could wipe out the whole city of London without harm to global morale and that hearing loss from countless explosions not to mention brain damage from dim dialogue could still be obviated by an inexpensive system of passive defense i.e. earplugs. ENLARGE Macarena Garcia Cohen Media Group Blancanieves For a different kind of paradox see ""Blancanieves"" Pablo Bergers spectacular retelling of the Snow White myth. Mr. Berger makes his heroine played by Macarena Garcia the daughter of a famous bullfighter who flees her evil stepmother falls in with a troupe of circus dwarfs and becomes a star toreador in her own right. Whats more the filmmaker puts her in 1920s Spain and tells her tale in a silent film shot in retroresplendent black-and-white. Its something of a stunt to be sure and destined to be seen at least by those who havent seen this remarkable film as emulating ""The Artist."" Yet the images in ""Blancanieves"" carry a dramatic charge that those in ""Renoir"" dont even though paradoxically theyre complemented only by music not by words. Watch a clip from the film ""Blancanieves"" a twist on the Snow White fairy tale that is set in 1920s Seville and centered on a female bullfighter. (Photo/Video Cohen Media Group) How this could be has to do with the essence of silent film. Mr. Berger and his cinematographer Kiko de la Rica work the wordless medium for all its worth whether with razzle-dazzle montages (Blancanieves stricken by amnesia suddenly sees her previous life playing out before her eyes during a crucial moment in the bull ring); swirling dances (flamenco doesnt need words) or searching closeups ( Maribel Verdus sex-crazed stepmother Encarna is evil incarnate but wittily so.) And Alfonso de Vilallongas music isnt mere accompaniment its a score with rich emotional resonance. The silents as this film suggests achieved aesthetic marvels before sound came along to set things back for a while. DVD Focus The Believer (2001) Ryan Gosling has spoken recently of giving up acting for a while. All the more reason to check out his first starring role on the big screen. Mr. Gosling is terrifyingly brilliant or brilliantly terrifying as the title character Danny Balint. Danny is Jewish a conceited bully of a yeshiva boy grown into a pugnacious young man. Danny is also an anti-Semitic skinhead who wants nothing more than to kill Jews. Henry Beans remarkable film shows the ability of the human mind to hold and even cherish diametrically opposite thoughts. Vincent amp; Theo (1990) Ive recommended it before but ""Renoir"" calls it back to memory again. Robert Altmans film also portrays a peerless painter but in a very modern way its about art in the context of commerce. Tim Roth gives a phenomenal performance as Vincent van Gogh penniless and sinking into insanity as he does paintings that will one day sell for unimaginable millions. Paul Rhys is Vincents brother Theo a gallery owner who struggles to sell some of those paintings to a world that finds them of little interest and less value monetary or artistic. The Moment of Truth (1965) Francesco Rosis landmark film in Italian with English subtitles was shot documentary-style in brilliant color by Gianni Di Venanzo. Mr. Rosi isnt interested in the romantic trappings of the bull ring. He rips them away in order to show bullfighting as a bloody business that draws hopeful youngsters out of poverty only to exploit them by filling their heads with highfalutin notions of courage and art. The fictional hero Miguelin is played by the bullfighting legend Miguel Mateo known in real life as Miguelin. The film is available on a Criterion Blu-ray disc that does the original full justice. 9 Save Article Sign In to Save Subscribe to WSJ Text Size Regular Medium Large Google+ Print Show More Archives Advertisement Popular on WSJ Most Popular Videos Wildfires Uncover Historic Treasures for Archaeologists Corpse Flower Causes Big Stink in New York City Rio 2016 Giving Horses Wings to Compete Game of Thrones Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Glimpse Muslim Soldiers Father Delivers Message to Trump Most Popular Articles Opinion Hillary Clinton Underdog Campaigns Eye Pennsylvania Prize Hedge-Fund Money 48.5 Million for Clinton 19000 for Trump Turkeys Powerful Spy Network Failed to See Coup Coming Hillary Clintons Convention Speech Falls Short of Donald Trump Ratings Wall Street Journal U.S. Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Edition U.S. Asia Europe India America Latina Brasil Zhong Guo  (China) Ri Ben  (Japan) Text Size Small Medium Large Subscribe NowSign In WSJ Membership Benefits Download WSJ Apps Customer Center Legal Policies Subscribe Sign In TOP<< WSJ Membership WSJ+ Membership Benefits Digital Subscription Print Subscription Print and Digital Subscription Why Subscribe?

This gorgeously photographed wisely crafted and somber drama (   1/2 out of four; rated R; opens Friday in select cities) proceeds in unexpected directions which makes it all the more engrossing. Its one of the best and most ambitious films of the year.In addition to being beautifully directed by Derek Cianfrance (Blue Valentine) this layered drama about fathers and sons is brilliantly acted.From its innovative start -- a long tracking shot of Ryan Gosling as he walks through a carnival -- theres a powerful sense of dramatic tension.MORE The latest film reviews from USA TODAY MoviesGosling plays Luke a stunt motorcycle rider a two-bit carny Evel Knievel. As the tattooed towheaded Luke passes through Schenectady N.Y. he makes an effort to reconnect with Romina (Eva Mendes) a waitress with whom he had a fling. He learns that in his absence she gave birth to their infant son Jason. He decides to give up his itinerant existence settle nearby and provide for his son influenced by his own experience with an absentee dad.Luke lands a low-paying job as a mechanic. After some convincing from his shady boss (Ben Mendelsohn)he agrees to take part in a scheme to rob local banks with his adrenaline-fueled ability to race off on his motorcycle being a key component.Things inevitably go awry. A thrilling pursuit leads to Lukes life intersecting dramatically with that of Avery (Bradley Cooper) a rookie police officer. Each character derails the other in strikingly different ways.Then in a bold move that works surprisingly well roughly an hour into the film it changes narrative focus.The story goes from following Luke to centering on Avery who exposes corruption in the police department and grows increasingly distant from his wife Jennifer (Rose Byrne) and infant son AJ. A political animal Avery moves up in his career following in the footsteps of his influential father.The film loses some momentum in the final portion when it fast-forwards 15 years and focuses on high school classmates AJ (Emory Cohen) and Jason (Dane DeHaan) -- the sons of Avery and Luke. DeHaan is terrific subtly mirroring some of Goslings mannerisms for a convincing portrayal as his alienated son. But elements of AJs privileged character feel forced. The film explores a classic theme sons suffering for the sins of the father. But some of the actions the sons display in the end dont ring completely true.The first chapter focusing on Gosling is the most compelling. Theres an almost otherworldly magical realist quality in the way director Cianfrance shoots the initial story arc particularly at the carnival. Yet the story is always grounded in reality.Gosling and Cianfrance are inspired collaborators. Their last effort 2010s raw Blue Valentine drew a multifaceted performance from Gosling in a more intimate context the painful dissolution of a marriage. Gosling has less on-screen time here but his pitch-perfect performance leaves an indelible impression. Though her character finds a more responsible partner in Kofi (Mahershala Ali)Mendes has palpable chemistry with Gosling. Cooper is superb as a tortured hero.The Place Beyond the Pines fuses an insightful study of masculinity ambition and fatherhood with a stylishly made crime thriller resulting in a fascinating look at the unexpected ripple effect one person can have on the lives of many.Gosling deals with fatherhood in PinesSkip AdAd Loading...xEmbedxShare Actor Ryan Gosling reunites with filmmaker Derek Cianfrance for new drama The Place Beyond the Pines and wrestles with tattoos and fatherhood onscreen.

One story links to another and then another and another over decades. Hold on tight. Its a beast of a movie an emotional roller coaster that threatens to go off the rails and does. But Cianfrance working from a scrappy script he wrote with Ben Coccio and Darius Marder takes you on a hell of a ride. More News Suicide Squad Director David Ayer on Creating a New Joker Into the Forest Review The End of the World They Dont Feel Fine Gleason Review A Moving Look at Sports Hero Battling ALS Weekend Rock Question What Is Jared Letos Best Role? Bad Moms Review A Hangover for Stressed Mothers All Stories >> Ryan Gosling who teamed brilliantly with Cianfrance on Blue Valentine is spectacular as Luke a motorcycle stunt driver. And boy does he make an entrance. All praise to cinematographer Sean Bobbitt as he follows Luke from his trailer through circus grounds to a steel cage - the Globe of Death - where Luke rides his hog like a loop-de-loop. At a stop in Schenectady New York Luke reconnects with Romina (Eva Mendes) a one-night stand who he learns has given birth to their son Jason. The fact of fatherhood floors Luke. He wants to put down roots be responsible. Gosling and Mendes make these scenes sharply funny and touching. But going straight as a mechanic cant compare with the illicit kick of robbing banks with the help of a partner (a terrific Ben Mendelsohn) and getting away on his motorcycle. Enter Bradley Cooper as Avery a rookie cop who has a face-o ff with Luke that turns the wounded o cer into a local hero. Avery also has father issues. He wants the best for wife Jennifer (Rose Byrne) and their infant son AJ. But Avery lives in the shadow of his judge father (Harris Yulin) and his surrogate Big Daddy on the force a corrupt detective played with GoodFellas intensity by Ray Liotta. How Averys family connects with Lukes is spoiler territory that merits careful treading. But Coopers ferocity and feeling pull you in. The film skips ahead 15 years to focus on the sons of these flawed fathers. The grown AJ (Emory Cohen) and Jason (Dane DeHaan) - one spoiled the other struggling - interconnect in ways you dont see coming. DeHaan a young actor of staggering gifts is especially moving his face a road map of youthful confusion and need. Cianfrance bites o ff more than one film can e ffectively chew much less digest.

This is a big movie with a lot on its mind. Slowly it unfolds into a kind of epic. For its co-writer and director Derek Cianfrance whose last film was the tortured love story ""Blue Valentine"" ""Pines"" represents a step up in ambition similar to the one Paul Thomas Anderson took from ""Hard Eight"" to ""Boogie Nights."" Cianfrance draws a superb performance from Ryan Gosling as a traveling carnival performer with a gift for riding a stunt bike. An encounter with an old girlfriend (Eva Mendes) at the fairgrounds in Schenectady NY leads him to a discovery that she had intended to keep hidden from him He has a son Jason whom she is raising with another man (Mahershala Ali). Luke (Gosling) quits his job and begins to search for something that will enable him to support his child. A fellow motocross buff (Ben Mendelsohn) who gives him a job as a mechanic suggests Why not try robbing banks? Ill stop the plot summary there (and suggest you not read too many other reviews) because its a great pleasure when a filmmaker with Cianfrances lyricism earthy naturalism and respect for composition can also execute a series of sharp plot turns as thrilling as the ones Luke pulls off on his motorbike. I will warn you though that this is a soulful sober deliberately paced film that is not to be confused with a popcorn picture. ""Pines"" widens its scope to bring in an ambitious cop (Bradley Cooper who usually annoys me but is acceptable here) a sinister fellow officer (Ray Liotta) a prickly DA (Bruce Greenwood) and finally two wayward high school friends (Emory Cohen who is terrifically slimy and Dane DeHaan who was the lead in last years ""Chronicle""). Though ""Pines"" is very much aligned with moviedoms somewhat tiresome romanticization of outlaws and its reflexive castigation of police its cops-and-robbers framework underlies a profoundly satisfying symmetry. The film is all about pairs matches and repetition as the characters struggle to break out of patterns seemingly set by impetuous split-second decisions. Neither Goslings character nor Coopers (they dont share much screen time) is wholly sympathetic yet both put themselves in considerable danger by trying to give money to the same woman for different reasons. The two teens at first drawn together by their love of obliviousness (they abuse drugs together) are then pulled apart by their knowledge of history. Though the film doesnt push any one theme too heavily it makes time for surprisingly heartfelt moments of moral reflection. Wrongdoing sets the stage for even more contemptible behavior building to a moment of pure bewildering outrage elegantly disguised A sleeping infant is being lifted carefully out of his crib shortly to be returned to the same place without even being woken. On the surface innocuous the act is an intrusion and an abuse that makes you want to scream. Cianfrance like P.T. Anderson makes the camera roam and soar with painstakingly devised tracking shots and swooping crane work. Such tricks can be abused but this director has a sure sense of tension making the bank scenes and the motorcycle chases fantastically gripping. Equally important he knows how unnerving it can be not to show something as when Liottas face is partially blocked during a scene shot inside a car and in another when we cant tell whether someone has been shot to death or not. Its a film of a master craftsman a director who can imbue the ordinary with poetry. Who would have thought that humble Schenectady that upstate burg would inspire the titles of two ambitious indie films? First there was ""Synecdoche New York"" (which rhymes with Schenectady) and now theres this one. The towns name is a Mohawk word. It means ""the place beyond the pines.""

By David Denby Ryan Gosling plays a stunt biker in a movie directed by Derek Cianfrance.   Credit Illustration by David Palumbo Derek Cianfrances earnest broodingly ambitious movie ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" begins with a close-up of Ryan Goslings tattooed torso which as Emma Stone noted in ""Crazy Stupid Love"" looks Photoshopped for perfection. The shot continues without a cut as Gosling--a stunt biker named Luke--walks into a carnival tent climbs onto a motorcycle rides into a steel globe (""the Cage of Death"") and zips around the interior of the structure like a fly in a jar. Its existentialism in a nutshell life and possibly death on a journey going nowhere. Cianfrance (""Blue Valentine"") and his cinematographer Sean Bobbitt stay close to the restless Luke as he tears down the streets and through the surrounding woods of Schenectady New York where the travelling carnival is playing. Luke encounters a woman he had a fling with last time he was in town Romina (Eva Mendes) who now has a baby boy--his son it turns out. He wants Romina back but he has no money so he becomes a bank robber to support her and the child. Now there may be an interesting movie in the story of a man whos split between the stability of family life and the anarchy of outlawry but Cianfrance devoted to Goslings macho mystique hasnt made it. Cool violent a cigarette dangling from his mouth Gosling reprises his inexorable-loner routine from ""Drive."" Cianfrance and the screenwriters Ben Coccio and Darius Marder wrote thirty-seven drafts of the script but gave him almost nothing to say. He rides he smokes he knocks over banks he loves his baby and thats it. Perhaps Cianfrance didnt want to waste words on Gosling because in a shocking move he disposes of him early in deliberate imitation of the way Hitchcock disposed of Janet Leigh in ""Psycho."" Gosling doesnt go near a shower but he gets plugged by a character weve never seen before Avery (Bradley Cooper) a lawyer who decided to become a cop to do the peoples work on the street. Avery is the new protagonist and Cooper gives a quiet serious performance as a straight arrow. The second part of ""Pines"" is all about Averys fight against police corruption. Its the kind of story thats been done in the movies many times in urban settings that are--how shall I put it?--more richly colorful than Schenectady. The policemans crusade initially seems disconnected from the first part of the movie but it turns out that Avery after shooting Luke and leaving his little boy fatherless feels so guilty that he has trouble looking at his own baby son. Does this make any sense psychologically? Im not sure but again the idea might have worked if Cianfrance had dramatized it. Instead he produces the admission of remorse from Avery in a long scene with a psychiatrist. We never see Avery and his son together until the films third act when the boy is seventeen. After a while we realize that ""Pines"" is supposed to be about turbulent male relationships through the generations--what fathers and sons give to one another and withhold from one another. Im all in favor of experimental narrative forms and deep thematic undercurrents but this movie feels patchy and underdone. Cianfrance does however have a commanding way with actors and he pushes them to the edge. In the third section Lukes and Averys sons who dont know each other--or their fathers history--get thrown together in high school and start a friendship that falls into an uneasy combative rivalry. Cianfrance has cast two intense young actors Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen as the boys who are both into Ecstasy and Oxycontin and he sustains a nasty friction between them sandpaper rubbing sandpaper. Eva Mendes as Lukes lover a proud woman in love with a dangerous man puts every bit of anguished longing and overstrained faith that she can into her few scenes; she surges toward Gosling but the movie tosses her aside. ""Pines"" centered on the male line also slights Averys wife played by the elegant Rose Byrne. When Emory Cohen cast as her and Averys son shows up hes a loutish kid with a Long Island street accent. Even as a rebel and a screwup who never had his fathers love he isnt believable as the child of either parent. Cianfrance keeps his eye on the long lines of the film but a lot of the character details are fuzzy or approximate or just missing and the movie which holds your attention from moment to moment by the end leaves you grasping for the experience you havent had. It may be one of the casualties of the auteur theory and the general solemnization of directors that some of the most talented people now just start shooting a script as if big ideas and directorial vision were enough to hold a movie together. Sometimes a little hard common sense helps too. The American flag waving in freedom-loving air above the White House is shot full of holes and rudely tossed onto the lawn in ""Olympus Has Fallen"" a bullet-ridden hunk of paranoia that should stir up anyone not sufficiently attuned to the threat posed to the United States by North Korea. The Koreans it seems are coming. An elite commando squad of forty led by a thick-shouldered terrorist named Kang (Rick Yune) fight their way into the building take the President (Aaron Eckhart) hostage execute the Vice-President on television kick the Secretary of State (Melissa Leo) in the stomach and in general soil the linens of Americas citadel. The thugs threaten to kill the President too. Their demands are the withdrawal of American forces from South Korea and of the Seventh Fleet from waters near the Korean peninsula; they want to ""unify"" the Korean people. They are also trying to get the secret codes that will allow them to blow up American I.C.B.M.s in their silos thus leaving the country a wasteland. The Speaker of the House (Morgan Freeman) takes command but the only one who can save the President--not to mention the world--is a disgraced former Secret Service agent Mike Banning. Hes played by Gerard Butler a second-tier star from Scotland whose lack of humor may remind you why Bruce Willis has lasted so long as an action hero. Banning runs into the building and proceeds to eliminate one terrorist after another bashing one guy over the head with a bust of Lincoln. The movie is ""Die Hard"" in the White House a combination of the violent and the cheesy which may nevertheless push a few buttons. The box-office gods seem to have smiled on this project; just before ""Olympus"" opened the North Koreans conducted an underground nuclear test and then threatened to ""target"" America with their high-level missile technology. In principle Im willing to be concerned about North Korea. Im even willing to be entertained by an action movie about Korean terrorists. But ""Olympus"" is an entirely conventional film and one cant help feeling that the director Antoine Fuqua (""Training Day"") and the first-time screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt were looking around for a new enemy and just settled on the North Koreans. Beneath the alarm bell summoning the nation to a new danger most moviegoers will detect the familiar tones of big-budget exploitation. I liked Fuquas volatile work in ""Training Day"" (2001) and this movie starts well. In a kind of prologue set eighteen months earlier the Presidents car spins out of control on a bridge during a furious snowstorm. Banning saves his boss but allows the First Lady (Ashley Judd) to fall to her death. (Like Clint Eastwoods Secret Service agent in ""In the Line of Fire"" hes haunted by his failure and needs to prove himself again.) This nighttime sequence is eerily beautiful and frightening. The assault on the White House is unconvincing but it has our curiosity going for it how do you storm the best-defended building in the world? Apparently you begin by getting a slow-moving military plane to shoot up Washington which creates something of a distraction. Then innocent-looking Korean tourists outside the White House suddenly pull machine guns and explosives out of their backpacks blast through the fence and fight their way in. But once Fuqua moves inside he loses our attention because weve watched what follows dozens of times before. There are endless scenes of Banning moving down darkened corridors and engaging in firefights and hand-to-hand combat shot in the usual fragmented way which makes it impossible to see most of what is happening. And Fuqua doesnt deliver on what he has set up. Early in the film he makes much of the Presidents young son who knows the inner corridors and tunnels of the White House but once the assault begins the kid hides; he never gets to use much of his knowledge. The President is supposed to be a tough guy but hes tied up in an underground bunker most of the time getting slapped around; he never really gets into the movie either. ""Olympus"" ends with a burst of patriotic fervor and the words ""They came to desecrate a way of life. But they gave us a gift a chance for rebirth."" The movie isnt a desecration but its action filmmaking not America that needs to be reborn.  David Denby has been a staff writer and film critic at The New Yorker since 1998.

(Atsushi Nishijima) Joe Neumaier NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Updated Thursday March 28 2013 1200 PM Title The Place Beyond the Pines Film Info With Ryan Gosling Bradley Cooper Eva Mendes Three generations of men collide after a crime spree. Director Derek Cianfrance. (220) R; Language violence drugs. Sunshine Lincoln Square. The silent moments are what resonate in ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" Ryan Gosling as a roustabout-turned-criminal driving a motorbike to nowhere; Bradley Cooper as a small-town police officer silently holding another mans infant son; two teens sizing each other up in a cafeteria. This emotionally ambitious mess has faults to spare but theres also something fuzzily honest about it. Its filled with both too many neatly-tied threads and too many dangling plots but its also buoyed by an integrity that slowly comes into focus. The film is told in three sections each one gliding into the next. Gosling is Luke a stunt rider in a traveling carnival. When his show stops in Schenectady N.Y. he happens upon Romina (Eva Mendes) a waitress who heads to the neon-lighted midway to see Luke. Theyd had a fling the previous summer and she just wants to see him again to look for something she isnt sure is there. Stopping by Rominas house Luke discovers she has an infant son. The other discovery Lukes the dad. Although uninvited he decides to stay in town to be a father to the boy Jason. But Lukes job as a mechanic doesnt pay much so when his weaselly boss (amusingly odd Ben Mendelsohn) suggests they rob banks too -- using Lukes cycle skills for fast getaways -- he agrees. Lukes heists are stopped by a young cop named Avery Cross (Cooper). Hailed as a hero Cross has pressures in his own life including a police captain (Ray Liotta) eager to find all the cash Luke stole. Cross has a baby boy the same age as Lukes which weighs on his conscience. Fifteen years later Cross running for state attorney general has a son named A.J. (Emory Cohen) whos a spoiled party kid. When A.J. changes schools he meets Jason (Dane DeHaan) a brooding loner. The two become friends until the latter realizes their fathers crossed paths years earlier. Bradley Cooper in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" (Atsushi Nishijima) Writer-director Derek Cianfrance who made 2010s extraordinary and beautiful ""Blue Valentine"" has a reach that sadly exceeds his grasp. This is however the kind of narrative ambition that also eluded Sean Penn (in the similar-feeling ""The Indian Runner"") as well as Cianfrances own cinematic father figure John Cassavetes in his later films. But what works here works well from novelistic flourishes (Lukes signature circus stunt with other riders inside a giant metal ball) to small details (Cross good-sport attitude following a desk-job demotion). Shooting through are ideas about masculinitys cost and toll and Gosling Cooper Liotta and DeHaan -- one of todays most promising young actors -- find poetry in that. As suggested in its title the poetry in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" can be elusive but also easy to get lost in. Magic moment Luke and Rominas nighttime ride.

"Place Beyond the Pines The | Reelviews Movie Reviews Out now Cher Harold Rosson Eva Green Benjamin ... Home Video Views ReelThoughts Currently in Cinema ReelViews Library Login Specials My Books Array ( [page] =gt; reelviews [view] =gt; place-beyond-the-pines-the ) Place Beyond the Pines The (United States 2012) March 28 2013 A movie review by James Berardinelli By turns powerful and frustrating The Place Beyond the Pines is a three act tale about the sins of the fathers being visited upon the sons. It uses coincidence to emphasize consequence and ably applies karmic lifestyle interpretation to the text. The films narrative offers three separate but interrelated stories but does so in a straightforward manner not requiring the viewer to piece together a cinematic jigsaw puzzle. Unfortunately instead of getting stronger as the running time mounts The Place Beyond the Pines heads in the opposite direction with the somewhat meandering final act being substantially weaker than the two to precede it. The end result is that the movie feels longer than its already significant 140-minute length and the ending is something of an anticlimax. The movie lacks the verisimilitude of Cianfrances Blue Valentine but its not as grim either. That isnt to imply The Place Beyond the Pines could be characterized as upbeat. In fact it spends time wallowing in darkness and corruption but at least theres an element of hope to the way things turn out. Strong acting at least during the first two acts strengthens the films foundation and makes it easier to accept the somewhat jarring change of main character when the narrative shifts from Chapter One to Chapter Two. The leads in the third segment however arent up to the level of their predecessors and this is yet another reason why The Place Beyond the Pines seems to be gasping for breath as it staggers across the finish line. Motorcycle daredevil Luke Glanton (Ryan Gosling) finds his rootless world turned upside down when he learns that he fathered a child as a result of a brief affair with a Schenectady New York waitress named Romina (Eva Mendes). Fatherhood is important to Luke; he wants to be a part of his young sons life and care for him but he doesnt know how. It doesnt help that he is unemployed and cursed with a limited skill set. He gets a job working for a local mechanic (Ben Mendelshohn) who teaches him that there are easier and more lucrative ways to get money than tinkering under the hoods of the occasional customers automobile. Officer Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) is an ambitious strait-laced cop who discovers how difficult it can be to carry the label of ""hero"" without besmirching it. A law-school graduate who joined the Schenectady force to fight injustice on the front lines he is given a dispiriting lesson in the reality of police work by a network of corrupt cops. His wife Jennifer (Rose Byrne) resents the danger to his life and his own conscience refuses to let him take the easy and lucrative way out. Two high school kids Jason (Dane DeHaan) and AJ (Emory Cohen) form an unlikely friendship based on Jasons drug-dealer contacts and AJs ability to get cash. The relationship between the two follows a familiar trajectory the outsider doing what he can to remain in a popular kids shadow and reap the rewards resulting from such proximity. But Jason and AJ share a secret of which neither is aware. The first two segments of The Place Beyond the Pines are dramatically compelling and narratively unpredictable. Theres pathos in the way Luke attempts to cope with the sudden revelation that he has a son and in the desperation that drives him to take risks to provide the child with a better upbringing than he had. (""My father was never around and look how I turned out."") Likewise Avery is a well-drawn character who copes with issues rarely addressed in movies. When cops shoot someone in the line of duty and are publically lauded for it how do they process it? In Averys case the reaction is believable. Unfortunately the strengths of the productions first two-thirds are diluted in the final act. The lead characters in this portion of the movie are flat the story hinges on a transparent contrivance and the pace is sluggish. Theres a cyclical sense of balance and closure in the way The Place Beyond the Pines ends but Cianfrance is unable to maintain the same high level from start to finish. The camerawork is dominated by handheld shots but they are less distracting and motion sickness-inducing than in some productions. Cianfrance has found the trick to pull the audience into the drama without causing nausea. The car chase which is seen entirely through the front window of a police cruiser and accomplished in one seemingly unbroken take is effective. Also noteworthy is the opening shot where the camera follows Luke as he gets ready for and executes his motorcycle gig. Although seemingly simple the underlying complexity involves either replacing Ryan Gosling with a double or putting the actor in a position to do a difficult stunt while the cameras are rolling. Although The Place Beyond the Pines is not an unqualified success when Cianfrance stumbles its because hes reaching for greatness - a quality infinitely preferable than the opposite which is where far too many motion pictures become mired. The characters are interesting and capture our sympathy and although there are things to criticize about the final forty-five minutes it brings the saga to a conclusion. Theres a lot to like about The Place Beyond the Pines even if it isnt the feel-good movie of the spring.

Our Community Grading Tool is in beta. Send Feedback. Share Tweet Derek Cianfrances Blue Valentine was defined by an almost unbearable intimacy an eagerness to plumb deep into the most wrenching emotions of a doomed romance captured with raw candor and honesty. The Place Beyond The Pines Cianfrances remarkable but overreaching follow-up initially shares those qualities as well as another riveting star turn from Ryan Gosling who lends his soulful trick motorcycle rider turned outlaw antihero the minimalist magnetism of a young Steve McQueen. Few actors are as riveting doing absolutely nothing and The Place Beyond The Pines perfectly typecasts Gosling as a noir staple the decent but rudderless drifter driven to violent and desperate action. To the films credit its damn near impossible to imagine where The Place Beyond The Pines will end based on where it begins even though its ever-widening scope causes it to lose some of the grubby intensity of its early scenes. Goslings life is a neon blur of highways carnival tents shitty diner food and one-night stands before he re-encounters pretty single mom Eva Mendes during a small-town stop and must wrestle with the unexpected but hardly shocking consequences of their brief fling years earlier. The previously directionless Gosling suddenly has something to live for but his desperate attempts to provide for his new family lead him into a charged encounter with a well-born lawman (Bradley Cooper) that has dramatic ramifications on both mens lives--which in turn ricochet through the lives of their families as well. Its tricky to do justice to the ambition and vision of The Place Beyond The Pines without giving away too much about its plot since the time period scope and protagonists change with each act. The Place Beyond The Pines is never more compelling than in its first act which has the succinct characterization and deft sense of time place and class of a first-rate hard-boiled short story. As it gets more ambitious the films take on its material grows less assured though its unwieldiness as it moves toward its conclusion is largely a byproduct of its Herculean ambition.

The impulse to challenge oneself is just too rare these days. But that doesnt mean you have to love where that directors ambition takes him. In Derek Cianfrances somber sprawling follow-up to 2010s Blue Valentine the filmmaker weaves three stories about the long tendrils of fate into one downer tapestry. Set in drab dishwater-lit Schenectady N.Y. The Place Beyond the Pines kicks off its long slow death march toward heaviness with Ryan Goslings Luke a motorcycle daredevil risking his neck as part of a small-time traveling carnival. Luke whose hair is dyed as blond as toasted straw and who shows off his inked-up biceps under a sleeveless Metallica T-shirt is blindsided by the discovery that he has an infant son from a one-night stand during his last trip through town. The mother played by Eva Mendes has attempted to move on with a new man. But theres a sad half-hopeful look in her eyes that hints to Luke that the doors still open a crack. So he sticks around trying to become a good father while turning to a string of bank robberies to support his new family. Luke gets off on the rush of his half-assed stickups -- or maybe its the feeling of finally having someone to provide for. Either way you know it wont end well. After going for one payday too many he winds up on the wrong end of a shoot-out with the cops. With that Cianfrance whiplashes into part 2 narrowing his focus onto Bradley Coopers Avery Cross the rookie officer who took down Luke and snowballed into a local-news hero. Weeks later Cross is still haunted by the incident especially since he has a son the same age as the one Luke left behind. But hes also driven enough to parlay his newfound fame into a promotion. Is it because hes so sure of his own abilities or because hes got his sights set even higher -- on a career in politics? Like so many crucial plot points in this undercooked overwrought film its never clear. Instead of pausing to explain Cianfrance just pushes headlong into the third (and weakest) chapter of the endless triptych scrambling to tie a tidy bow on things by showing how the fates of Lukes and Averys teenage sons (Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen) intersect 15 years down the road. All of these overlapping coincidences may remind some people of 2004s Crash -- and Cianfrances film is just as phony as Paul Haggis Best Picture winner. Each twist is more convenient than the last. You dont buy any of them for a second. The Place Beyond the Pines wants to be a deep-dish meditation on fathers sons and the consequences of the decisions we make. But its a slow-burner that burns so slowly its wick completely fizzles out. Gosling who simmered with a lowlife intensity in Blue Valentine escapes from the 140-minute slog the cleanest. He has that rare gift of making unpleasant characters sympathetic. And Mendes who seems to carry the worlds weight on her exhausted shoulders is quietly heartbreaking. Unfortunately Cooper draws the short matchstick. His underdrawn character gets tangled up in his directors oversize ambitions. Thanks to Silver Linings Playbook we now know what hes capable of -- and its more than this.

"Our Floundering Fathers | Observer Politics| Arts amp; Entertainment| Style amp; Design| Business amp; Technology| Search for Submit Observer Culture Politics National New York International Editorials Arts amp; Entertainment Art Movies Music Performing Arts TV Style amp; Design Fashion Food amp; Drink Health amp; Wellness Home Design Real Estate Travel Business amp; Technology Deals Innovators Internet Culture Media Startups About Advertise Subscribe Careers Masthead Contact Privacy Terms Follow Us Sign Up for Newsletters movie Our Floundering Fathers Gosling and Cooper deliver performances worthy of this generations leading men By Rex Reed  03/26/13 400pm Derek Cianfrance one of the screens most gifted and innovative new directors proved to be a master storyteller with a rare and unflinching emotional directness with Blue Valentine the hauntingly intimate 2010 dissection of a marriage. Reunited with that movies star Ryan Gosling for another richly detailed and seamlessly calibrated triumph of classical filmmaking called The Place Beyond the Pines his maturity of vision is repeated and expanded into a broader and more complex tapestry of interconnected family relationships that spans generations and keeps you paralyzed with suspense. Told in a daunting but poetic narrative triptych that pares the film into three sections the effect is lyrical. I have seen it twice and found new things to admire both times. I think youll find it as fresh original and breathlessly exciting as I did and you can start with the very first scene a swung blade slashes the air the muscles of a naked back rippling covered with tattoos. The camera follows from behind as the broad shoulders file out of a tractor-trailer dressing room bleached hair reflecting the lights of a roller coaster and taut muscles stretching the fabric of a skin-tight T-shirt as the body reaches for a leather jacket and mounts a motorcycle. The engine roars and the camera closes in on the ravaged baby face of Ryan Gosling. Its the greatest entrance of any star I have seen in years. He is Luke a stunt rider in a crummy traveling carnival who sells cheap thrills for bargain discounts beds a few girls and heads for the open road before sunrise. Making a stop in Schenectady Luke decides to look up a one-night stand from a year ago a poor but honest and hardworking Latina named Romina (Eva Mendes) who works as a waitress in a greasy-spoon cafe. What he doesnt know is that after their fling Romina had a baby boy she never told him about. Rough as a corncob but secretly sensitive and needy (similarities to Mr. Goslings role in the great noir film Drive are unavoidably justified) the revelation brings out a paternal side in Luke he didnt think possible. Despite the fact that Romina is living with another man Luke turns from vagabond loner into caring and devoted father but to provide for his kid lure his girl away from her new lover and make a home for them both building cribs and buying ice cream has limitations. With no parenting skills Luke turns to robbing banks in another series of dizzying action sequences including a high-speed chase through a cemetery with a flat tire. Enter Bradley Cooper as Avery Cross the college dropout and loser son of a New York Supreme Court judge-turned-rookie cop who accidentally brings Luke to a violent premature date with destiny and takes all of the credit. Its a jarring scene but in a sense Mr. Goslings impact is just beginning as Mr. Cooper takes up where his unfinished story left off. The middle section of the film is about how Avery becomes both a hero and a pariah reluctantly shares part of Lukes bank booty with a corrupt cop (Ray Liotta) then turns the tables on his own precinct resorting to extortion and blackmail in exchange for a promotion to assistant D.A. Fifteen years pass with Averys successes and failures all driven by guilt shame and a search for redemption as hes elected to the exalted position of New York attorney general with a closetful of secrets. The third act then focuses on their children--Lukes son Jason and Averys son A.J.--who grow up in different worlds but turn into boys with problems of their own. The irony is the way their paths cross as 17-year-old friends and enemies beginning a new generation of crime and punishment with a surprise around every corner. In the end its a human story in which a sons legacy is to search in myriad ways for the same purpose and meaning his father sought decades before in a circle of life that never ends. Its the old sins-of-our-fathers theme stretched to ask questions about the truth of what makes a man a man propelled to new levels of overlapping multi-generational gaps of fate in ""the place beyond the pines"" which is a translation of what the Mohawk Indians called their native Schenectady. Its a dysfunctional family saga on a grand scale that could easily become the basis for a prizewinning soap but Mr. Cianfrances artistic vision catapults it above the limitations of contrivance and into a realm of constantly evolving shifts of tone and mood. The film is beautifully photographed by British cinematographer Sean Bobbitt (Shame) with exquisitely nuanced performances by Mr. Gosling (who surpasses all expectations) and Mr. Cooper (far superior to his limited role in the overrated Silver Linings Playbook). And Dane DeHaan as Mr. Goslings emotionally damaged son Jason adds a magnetic younger accent to the already dark landscape of The Place Beyond the Pines. rreedobserver.com THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES Running Time 140 minutes Written by Derek Cianfrance Ben Coccio and Darius Marder Directed by Derek Cianfrance Starring Ryan Gosling Bradley Cooper Eva Mendes Comment Filed under movie Trending Now Bill Maher Im With Her or Im With Stupid Politics Pussy Riot On Their Provocative Donald Trump-Inspired Art Installation Culture The (Real) Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia Origin Story Culture Marina Abramovic I Had Three Abortions Because Children Hold Female Artists Back Culture Observer About Advertise Careers Contact Privacy Terms Powered by WordPress.com VIP",http://observer.com/2013/03/our-floundering-fathers/,200,theplacebeyondthepines31,theplacebeyondthepines,com/2013/03/our-floundering-fathers/

Still theres no mistaking the immense ambition and tremendous craftsmanship of director and co-writer Derek Cianfrance (who made ""Blue Valentine"" with Gosling and Michelle Williams) and I think the movie is most effective if you know little about the story going in. So Ill be pretty guarded in what I tell you about the story which takes a couple of surprising narrative left turns and jumps forward in time.From the opening tracking shot as Sean Bobbitts camera follows Gosling playing a motorcycle stunt rider named Luke out of his trailer and across a crowded fairground in upstate New York sometime around 1995 ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" displays that intense connection to the working-class Northeast that made ""Blue Valentine"" so distinctive. A laconic post-James Dean dreamboat with tattoos and a blond dye job Luke excites the envy and/or lust of everyone he meets and has no difficulty finding a different girl in every town. Yet somehow without having Luke say much of anything Cianfrance is able to convey that he wants something more.Thats when Luke finds out that a woman named Romina (Eva Mendes) whom he met the last time he came through Schenectady had a baby about nine months after he blew town. Actually Rominas got a boyfriend Kofi (Mahershala Ali of ""Treme"" and ""House of Cards"") who seems like a stand-up guy with a job and a house and is willing to raise the kid as his own. Arguably this whole movie can be boiled down to Lukes lack of self-knowledge; if he had taken a long hard look at his drop-dead handsome self in the mirror and concluded he just wasnt daddy material then a long chain of fatalistic and dramatic dominoes would never have been launched.Because once Luke quits the carny stunt-riding circuit to devote himself to some imaginary ideal of American dadhood his employment prospects are as they say somewhat limited. This makes him easy prey for the shady avuncular mechanic named Robin (the reliably terrific Australian actor Ben Mendelsohn) whos been looking for a young stupid and daring accomplice to get back in the bank-robbery business. If this is familiar territory and almost feels like a dirt-under-the-fingernails remake of Nicolas Winding Refns ""Drive"" its magnificently handled a propulsive ominous and profoundly compassionate portrayal of doomed dreamers on the underside of Clinton-era prosperity.If Gosling doesnt get much dialogue - in a screenplay that Cianfrance Ben Coccio and Darius Marder reportedly rewrote 30-odd times - thats because Luke isnt a big talker. This likable actors chronic overexposure may be ebbing at last but ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" shows him at his best as a person whose semi-iconic cool barely masks a febrile weakness and uncertainty. Theres an unmistakable sexual electricity between Luke and Romina that leaves her unable to resist him despite the bitterly obvious fact that sticking with Kofi is a far more sensible choice. Like low-end criminals the world over Luke gets too confident and one of his daredevil bank-heist getaways puts him in the path of Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) an ambitious rookie street cop and judges son who has visions of a future in politics. You Might Also Like I said I wouldnt give away too much about the narrative switchbacks in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" and Ill stick to that. Lets say simply that the second section of the movie is mostly about Avery and his rise to power while the third section isnt about Avery or Luke but follows their kids into the present through the long aftermath of their first fateful encounter. Avery is a clean cop with a heros reputation who gradually turns his departments extensive culture of corruption exemplified in an unctuous but charming senior detective played by Ray Liotta (as ever the king of scumbags) to his advantage. (Free advice to the Schenectady chamber of commerce Just let it roll off; keep that press release in the Drafts folder. Trust me.)This episode of the film is also compelling in a different vein - the urban political thriller or cop procedural - but the ironic contrast between Avery and Luke is ladled on pretty thick. Avery stays on the right side of the law (as far as the world knows) and Lukes a dangerous renegade but one of thems trying to provide for his family while the other is thinking only of himself. Actually to put it more accurately both are pursuing mythical ideals of American manhood and both will reap the fruits of their delusions in almost Biblical fashion. Unfortunately while the middle portion of the film is only slightly weaker than its opening section - and Coopers careful performance as the hooded calculating Avery simply cant compete with Goslings charisma - the final section plunges off a cliff from the territory of Major American Film into that of After-School Special. Its not revealing anything huge to say that the last third of the movie is set in or near the present when Lukes and Averys sons are teenagers and high-school classmates who meet by accident not knowing their dads past history. Cianfrance is going for a big payoff here no question; some grand allegory is in view about the toxic nature of so many male friendships and mentor-student relationships and about how badly fathers can screw up their sons. But it all feels reasoned out or imagined to me rather than felt and the highly specific cultural and geographical details of the first two sections - its profound Schenectady-ness - is replaced by generalizations including Emory Cohens performance as Averys son a gangsta-lingo drug-abusing caricature of the privileged kid gone wrong.I never stopped being interested in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" and never stopped rooting for Cianfrance to make the hubristic ambition of his immense tripartite scheme pay off even as it evidently falls apart. More sympathetic viewers than I may simply ride with the tremendous momentum of the Gosling-Mendes section and forgive its slow decline and more power to them. The movie looks great throughout blending action urban drama and family melodrama with a dark thrumming undertone that holds them together. But like its overly symbolic title - which I could only half-explain even if I wanted to - this movie feels too loaded down with significance to simply be what it is. Follow More Andrew OHehir.

Then in a single five-minute tracking shot we follow Goslings character Luke across a fairground and into the tent where he and two other stunt motorcycle performers ride their bikes into a large sphere known (per the press notes) as the ""globe of death."" Around they go defying gravity and mortality--and one assumes proving something to themselves. Its a pretty apt metaphor for most of what follows in this tortured study of masculine ethos across the generations of failed fathers and the sons doomed to become them--all circling about in one big existential steel cage.If that sounds heavy-handed well yes it is though its one of the fascinating and frustrating things about The Place Beyond the Pines that you cant always tell if the testosterone-amped Sturm und Drang is meant sincerely or as a deadpan deflating of testosterone-amped Sturm und Drang. Certainly Goslings character verges on parody Decked out in cutoff heavy-metal T-shirts with a peroxide-blond dye job and a heavily tattooed body he suggests a trailer-park Prince Valiant a pubescent fantasy of toughness. And when Luke speaks Gosling uses a soft wounded half-whisper that tells us this is all some kind of put-on that this brooding hulk just wants to be loved. Its a close variation on the role Gosling played to stronger effect in Nicolas Winding Refns existential Hollywood thriller Drive where it was clear the character was meant to be an abstraction (hell he didnt even have a name). Here the setting is the more pragmatic working-class town of Schenectady and the director is Derek Cianfrance who previously collaborated with Gosling on another portrait of male ego the marital drama Blue Valentine.What is it about this particular stretch of upstate New York that inspires such feverish overreaching in filmmakers? Just a few years ago Charlie Kaufman made it the locus of Synecdoche New York his brilliant but bloated portrait of the artist as a middle-aged head case and now Cianfrance has made a similarly epic (140 minutes) go-for-broke everything-I-ever- wanted-to-put-into-a-movie movie. It seems to have been conceived (by Cianfrance and his co-screenwriters Ben Coccio and Darius Marder) in a dazed rush after marathon readings of Aeschylus Hemingway and Larry Brown. Sure to inspire indifference and cultish admiration in nearly equal measure this extravagant mess may someday be re-evaluated as a misunderstood masterpiece.Film Details The Place Beyond the Pines RatingR GenreDrama Running Time140 More Info Trailer Lukes story is but one of three that Cianfrance sets out to tell--not overlapping a la Babel and Crash but rather laid out end-to-end like links in an infernal cosmic chain. Reeling from the discovery that a casual fling with a waitress (Eva Mendes one of the films mostly expendable women) has resulted in an infant son Luke decides to quit the carny circuit and with a little prompting from a local mechanic (Animal Kingdoms Ben Mendelsohn) takes up the more lucrative profession of armed robbery. Their m.o. consists of Luke knocking over banks speeding away from the scene on his bike and right into the back of Mendelsohns waiting cargo truck. But when Luke starts to get a little too daring for his own good his partner blanches warning ""If you ride like lightning youre gonna crash like thunder""--a line that sounds like it was salvaged from the floor of the Talladega Nights writers room.Luke does crash figuratively speaking in to rookie cop Avery Cross (Bradley Cooper) whos clearly working on his own set of self-identification and daddy issues. Avery is a father too of a boy roughly the same age as Lukes and if you think that bit of plotting wont eventually be milked for its full Jacobean portent youd best leave before the movie reaches Act III ""15 Years Later."" In the meantime Cooper effectively takes over the picture as the mood shifts from brooding romantic melodrama to terse police procedural in the key of Sidney Lumet. Coopers terrific too oozing raw charisma and callow self-interest a dangerous combination in a precinct rife with dirty cops (including a detective named Deluca played with snarling menace by Ray Liotta whose dirtiness is actually supposed to come as a surprise).A graduate of the University of Colorado film school where he studied with avant-garde masters Stan Brakhage and Phil Solomon Cianfrance is a gifted stylist with a penchant for the mythic (even Blue Valentine his most strictly realistic work felt less like a movie about a marriage than the movie about marriage). His best film remains his debut Brother Tied (1998) a modern riff on the Cain and Abel story set in small-town Colorado brilliantly shot in black-and-white and widely screened at festivals (including Sundance) but never distributed and now almost impossible to see. The Place Beyond the Pines is a much bigger canvas and scene by scene it can be riveting in part because of the meticulous widescreen camerawork (the d.p. this time is Sean Bobbitt who shot Hunger and Shame for Steve McQueen) and also because of Cianfrances sure touch with actors who manage to rise above the ultimately thin and repetitive material. Toward the end there is some especially fine work by two relative newcomers Emory Cohen (from Antonio Camposs Afterschool) and Dane DeHaan (who played Shia LaBeoufs wiry young friend in Lawless) cast respectively as the sons of cop and robber trying to make sense of their entwined destinies. But the disparate pieces never quite jell; the movie is all trees and no forest.Follow VoiceFilmClub Soul Power Sharon Jones Wont Let Cancer Stop the Funk NEXT Contact Scott Foundas Follow Village Voice Village Voice Film amp; TV Film Film Reviews Film and TV Get the Film amp; TV Newsletter Stay up to date on the best new movies with our critics latest reviews interviews and trailers for the films coming to a theater near you each week.

Thats a clue For whats basically a grubby sins-of-the-father story the mood here is grander than expected--mythic portentous and likably heavy even in its overreach. We start in Dardenne-brothers territory as a mysterious tattooed carnival stunt biker (Ryan Gosling) awakens to his status as a father bailing on the circus to provide for his infant son by robbing banks. Were too close to Drive to see this performance as anything special but when Suicides ""Che"" churns to life on the soundtrack and Gosling peels out there are thrills to be had. Cianfrance has too much love for this blond Robin Hood to judge him all that harshly and just as our hero is cornered by the law were asked to switch allegiance to the ""hero cop"" (Bradley Cooper) who enters the tale also a young parent and surrounded by bad influences. (In his case its a corrupt precinct dominated by the ever-menacing Ray Liotta.) The shift feels like whiplash--another ones in store when we jump 15 years ahead to see the fates of the two kids--and theres a distinct feeling that the movie is trapped in its own pop psychology. Yet after the actorcentric fireworks of Cianfrances Blue Valentine (2010) its impressive to see him going after a wider sociopolitical scope one that would have been better served by a less repetitive structure. Even if the place beyond the pines is just Schenectady the ambition will lead to higher ground.

Daily Edition Login to download The Place Beyond the Pines Toronto Review 1228 PM PDT 9/8/2012 by David Rooney FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS A somber and striking drama that takes some wrong turns but features a charismatic performance from Ryan Gosling in the leanest and best of its three sections. TWITTER Ryan Gosling Bradley Cooper Eva Mendes and Dane DeHaan star in ""Blue Valentine"" director Derek Cianfrances moody drama about fathers and sons. TORONTO - Its mesmerizing balance of steaminess and melancholy made Blue Valentine one of the most distinctively intense American indies of the past few years. While Derek Cianfrances third feature The Place Beyond the Pines is far more diffuse and cant match its predecessors extraordinarily raw intimacy this drama about morality guilt and the long-range reverberations of the sins of the fathers packs moments of searing power. The films somber tone and choppy narrative will make it a challenging entry in the marketplace but the name cast will help. The drama unfolds in three movements set over 15 years with a different male character at the center of each one. Its weakness is that while the events follow in plot terms they dont achieve the smoothest flow making for a film that changes course too radically and strains for thematic cohesion. STORY Weinstein Co. Making Big Push for Pines Biggest problem in the screenplay by Cianfrance Ben Coccio and Darius Marder is the central section focusing on Avery Cross. A rookie cop played by Bradley Cooper he is presented as an honorable man and then conveniently puts his conscience on hold while his story arc follows what seems an inorganic direction. Far better is the gripping opening hour with Ryan Gosling as motorcycle stunt rider Luke and the concluding section with his 17-year-old son (Dane DeHaan). Introduced via a tight shot of his celebrated abs and a torso inked with tattoos that suggest a bruising past Goslings Luke is a death-cage rider with a traveling carnival. During a stop in Schenectady NY he re-encounters Romina (Eva Mendes) a fling from a couple years earlier. A diner waitress going to college and living with a new partner (Mahershala Ali) Ro attempts to keep her distance despite lingering feelings for him but Luke soon discovers that she is raising their infant son Jason. PHOTOS Bradley Cooper A Day in the Life Compelled to get involved in the boys life Luke quits his carnival job and sticks around sparking up a friendship with seedy auto mechanic Robin (Ben Mendelsohn). As a means of raising the cash needed to get him in the fatherhood game Robin suggests that Luke apply his motorcycle skills to bank robbery which can only spell trouble. While Gosling is essentially playing the two-wheel version of his Drive speed demon the actor effectively conveys the pent-up hurt and lurking danger of a damaged man reaching clumsily for something good and pure. The deglamorized Mendes also does soulful work while Mendelsohn follows his memorable Cannes exposure in the otherwise disappointing Killing Them Softly with another enjoyably offbeat character turn. Visually too the opening act has tremendous texture with cinematographer Sean Bobbitt using nervy handheld camera to visceral effect in pursuit scenes and much of the more charged action played out in exciting extended takes. At almost the one-hour mark Cianfrance abruptly removes his designated protagonist from the film making the unfair swap of Avery who intervenes in a robbery getaway attempt. Its a bold move but one that doesnt pay off and despite Coopers charismatic presence the character is inconsistently drawn. Initially conflicted about his actions Averys choices become more distancing as he quits the corrupt police force and follows his well-connected father (Harris Yulin) into public office. This is another movie and a less interesting one. The final stretch improves with DeHaan (Lawless) making a strong impression as Jason. When he and Averys son AJ (Emory Cohen) meet at school these two unsettled kids appear to feel an instinctive kinship but as the connection between their fathers becomes clear it dissolves into ugliness. Rose Byrne is given little to do as Averys anxious wife and Ray Liottas appearance as a menacing crooked cop is strictly routine. But Cianfrance generally shows again that he knows how to build immersive characterizations with his actors. And while this sorrowful triptych is uneven and perhaps overly ambitious the director displays a cool mastery of atmospherics and tone aided by Mike Pattons haunting score.

By David Edelstein Published Mar 24 2013 ShareThis (Photo Atsushi Nishijima/Courtesy of Focus Features) The title of Derek Cianfrances The Place Beyond the Pines is the English translation of the Iroquois word Schenectady and Im thinking that the poor little upstate New York town shouldnt have to bear the weight first of Charlie Kaufmans funereal Synecdoche New York and now this adrenalized Greek tragedy. The director calls it a classic tale of the sins of the father being visited upon the son and has fashioned it as a triptych. In the first segment mysterious blond tattooed biker Luke (Ryan Gosling) discovers that an old flame Romina (Eva Mendes) has given birth to his son and decides to rob banks to win her back from her stable responsible beau (Mahershala Ali). The next part centers on Avery (Bradley Cooper) a policeman whos having a terrible time recovering from a decisive encounter with Lukeand who as a result is driven to pose hard moral questions about his and other cops behavior. Part three takes place fifteen years later when both Averys and Lukes sons are teenagers grappling with very different but entwined legacies. Some of the key scenes take place amid the pines outside town where different characters face momentous choices about the direction of their livesand it was during one of them that I thought it might be time for a new phrase to lessen the pain of crazy-ambitious but stultifying movies Forget it Jake. Its Schenectady. Cianfrances Blue Valentine also suffered from a certain monotonousness as well as an overcaffeinated handheld camera that was always getting in the characters faces. But that movie had a pair of protagonists one of whom was played by Michelle Williams whose brave performance was a study in romantic ambivalenceand the anguish that comes from seemingly endless self-protection against an out-of-control mate (Gosling). There was real attraction and repulsion push and pull in those scenes. The Place Beyond the Pines has a much wider canvas but the segments are essentially monodramas so sketchily written that the big moments feel less like recognizable human behavior than recognizable screenwriter overreaching. Goslings scenes are the most vivid of course Its a hot-dog character and he has the most irresistible screen presence. And he has a terrific henchman in Ben Mendelsohn the creepy chinless psycho from Animal Kingdom here playing a character who doesnt quite track but is always on the tantalizing border between convivial and corrosive. But this once potentially major actor is repeating himself striking star poses with a face that has become a mask of tragicomedythe goofy smile somehow making the features droop so that he looks most doomed when most happy. Gosling sports a tattoo of a dagger with a drop of blood clearly meant to resemble a tearand its like a placard reading JAMES DEAN WAS HERE. Hes a martyr to Cianfrance who hasnt managed to make Lukes obsession to be with his son even vaguely convincing. Gosling makes the character work at the cost of looking fatuous. Cooper has a couple of fine intense moments but Avery is so underwritten that you wonder if half his scenes were cut. And hes supposed to be the movies fulcrum the character who connects the past and future. Cianfrance puts Avery at the center of a corruption plot in which Ray Liotta and a couple of other mean-looking dudes hassle Mendess Romina for money. He gets a lot of mileage out of Liottas ravaged visagethe actors expressions are scariest when theyre most tenderbut its all dramatically speaking beside the point a lame device to get Averys conscience churning. The final segment features an extraordinarily intense young actor named Dane DeHaan as Lukes morosely undermotivated son but by then the movies wheels and pulleys are squeaking so loudly that no performer could be heard above the din (or the audiences groans). Smart directors like Terrence Malick and before him Stanley Kubrick know enough to keep their thoughts to themselves and not spoil the illusion of profundity. But Cianfrance gives interviews in which he says hes wanted to make a triptych ever since he saw Abel Gances silent epic Napoleon. But Napoleon though sprawling isnt a three-part dramait just has a battlefield climax with three screens. No wonder this nearly two-and-a-half-hour movie feels as if it spread beyond its borders. The Place Beyond the Pines is like a clear-cut forest full of empty space. The Place Beyond the Pines Directed by Derek Cianfrance. Focus Features. R. E-mail filmcriticnewyorkmag.com.

Ryan Gosling opens the spectacle as Luke an iconically cool and laconic trick motorcycle racer who takes to crime to support a baby he didnt know he had. Were then introduced to Avery (Bradley Cooper) a go-getting young cop eager to make his bones by bringing the hot dog in. Thats all you should really know for now The movie performs a couple of switchbacks that are as impressive as Lukes riding and before you even know it Cianfrance has made a movie about the intergenerational DNA of bad blood.

Two half-stories about fathers and sons on opposite sides of the law do not a full movie make in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" the overlong and under-conceived reunion between ""Blue Valentine"" director Derek Cianfrance and lookalike star Ryan Gosling. Divided into three segments tacked one after the other the film begins with a lean ""Drive""-like portrayal of a motorcycle daredevil (Gosling) who takes to robbing banks after learning he has an infant son to support. Then the story takes a hard right turn effectively starting over with another less charismatic character. Once word gets out audiences will evaporate.SEE MORE Durban Film Festival Taking its name from the Iroquois meaning of Schenectady N.Y. where the pic takes place this gravely serious indie drama treats the city as the capital of compromise where values turn rancid the instant idealists come into contact with the other deadbeats in town. A brooding ladykiller half-covered in amateur tattoos ""Handsome Luke"" (Gosling) rides bikes for a living. Returning to Schenectady as part of a traveling stunt show Luke runs into lonely but unyielding Romina (Eva Mendes) a former one-night stand only to find that shes raising his kid. Luke quits on the spot and angles to insert himself into his infant sons life though Ro resists. She has good reason to be wary it turns out since Lukes idea of providing for the family entails knocking over local banks with no-good mechanic friend Robin (Ben Mendelsohn) a short-term scheme virtually guaranteed to end badly. When it does Cianfrance tries to keep things going by following Avery Cross (played with considerably less magnetism by Bradley Cooper) the rookie cop who sabotages what little chance Ro had of raising her son right. From here on ""Pines"" shifts gears focusing on Cross. Rather than finding a creative way for behavior to illuminate the characters state of mind Cianfrance and co-writers Ben Coccio and Darius Marder present a succession of on-the-nose scenes during which the conflicted Cross visits a police shrink chats with his service buddies and eventually appeals to his big-shot dad (Harris Yulin) about pulling some strings. Flash forward 15 years and the same approach applies to Lukes and Aarons sons each of whom is coping with the consequences of his parents selfish decisions. Aarons now struggling to raise teenage AJ (Emory Cohen) on his own and horrified that the youth is getting chummy with Lukes son (Dane DeHaan a picture of barely contained rage) but nowhere near as upset as the latter is to learn about his father. Where ""Blue Valentine"" succeeded by laying bare elemental human emotions then scrambling them in a way that felt daring and fresh ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" internalizes much of what the characters are feeling while telling their stories in rote linear fashion. Presented as such without subplots or any clear sense of forward momentum the film feels relatively meager in its insights. And yet the solution seems painfully obvious Remix the three chronological stories and the fragments might serve to reveal one another particularly as each follows its own mini-arc. While that may have been the original intent of Cianfrance and his editors Jim Helton and Ron Patane no evidence of any such effort remains resulting in the same sort of less-interesting treatment one might get by say rearranging ""Memento"" into chronological order. Dischordant music cues and striking widescreen lensing a mix of austere frames and woozy handheld create an uneasy mood upon which the pic only partially capitalizes.

Chris Haslam says April 21 2013 at 309 pm 20 minutes too long compromised denouement total lack of balls in the closure department and a failure to exploit key characters - Mendes Mendelsohn (who btw is Tom Waits excellent) - in a story that seems to have been lost in translation. The hook is that the rich get richer and the poor get deader but unless youre entertained as I was by the boldly long takes youll leave the cinema feeling simply poorer. Thank you for listening. Reply Keith K says April 16 2013 at 152 am A good review - but there are some errors that need editing. First paragraph ""Two half-stories about fathers and sons on opposite sides of the law do not a full movie make in ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" - pretty poor grammar. Also halfway through the article the author begins calling the character Avery Aaron. (Can I have an editorial position at Variety?)

""The Place Beyond the Pines"" starts its journey with a dark screen and the sound of breathing as our only stimulus. Stunt bike rider Luke (Ryan Gosling) sports a black Metallica t-shirt and a group of random scribbles masquerading as tattoos adorn his neck. Everything about him seems ""danger with a side of unstable"" and thats even before he gets into a rounded metal cage with two other stunt riders revs the engine and drives upside-down a few inches from another bike headed full speed in the opposite direction. Its a county fair and this attraction is probably called something like ""The Wheel of Death"" or ""Moto-Doom."" Luke is just passing through town. He smokes a lot and he has the look of the precise sort of person you wouldnt want to get into a physical altercation with. After the show he gets a visit from a woman he met the year before Romina (Eva Mendes). This sentimental reunion sets in motion a chain of events spanning decades and generations. Lives unravel with steam with the desperate and ugly past gaining furious and consequential ground on the present. To say more of the plot would be a disservice as the cleverness of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" springs from the atmospheric tension that comes from not knowing how each scene will play out. Those familiar with director Derek Cianfrance (""Blue Valentine"") will likely have some idea of what theyre in for though ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" has better pacing and far less muddled themes than his first feature film. There is true beauty in the despair that pervades ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" a film plotted out in triptych a treatise on the moral compromises we all make to protect and provide for our loved ones. In Cianfrances world there are no heroes only brutal shared truths protagonists filled with coiled rage set against menacingly dark hues of Schenectady New York. Also Check Out Stars Take the Red Carpet at the 2012 Toronto Film Festival Most of all ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" deals with how quickly the fragmented bonds of a culture can slip out from underneath lost souls. These bonds seem plenty sturdy -- the kindly police are patrolling your street your friendly neighborhood mechanic has a place you can crash for the night -- but all the illusions are swept away when the action of the film is in full throat. Bradley Cooper does serviceable work as young policeman Avery Cross and Ray Liotta has solid moments as a fellow officer as well. Rose Byrne and Dane DeHaan are also involved but lets not say how other than to note their participation and talents. The real art of ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" is the innovative plot construct which can only be compared to films such as ""The Godfather"" and ""A Prophet."" No ""The Place Beyond the Pines"" isnt as good as either of those films and its not nearly as watchable as either (less overall arc too weighty throughout) but it certainly heralds the arrival of a vibrant director. Its not the type of film anyone outside of ""serious"" film fans will have the patience for but its no less the accomplishment for the total lack of comfort it provides an audience.
